Therefore, in this paper, bimetallic electrocatalyst FeCo supported nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (FeCo-NG) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is proposed and has been successfully prepared through annealing of a mixture containing Fe, Co salts, dicyandiamide (DCDA) and graphene oxide (GO). The starting material GO appeared to be in multilayer sheets through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. Due to the high annealing temperature and the absence of the surfactant, agglomeration of FeCo nanoparticles was observed from the morphology analysis. The macrostructure size of the metals particles was observed to be increased over temperature. As the temperature increases, the agglomeration gets more intense because of the increased of van der Waals cohesive forces between the nanoparticles. In addition, the weak electrostatic interaction between the metal cations with the nitrogen and the GO sheets could also be the cause of the agglomeration. The weak electrostatic interaction caused the nanoparticles (Fe and Co) not attracted onto the GO sheets thus inhibit the reduction of FeCo and GO to occur in situ simultaneously. It is believed that the agglomeration of the electrocatalyst FeCo-NG could results to poor electrocatalytic activity of PEMFC.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0128-0198	2289-7526		WOS:000455993000005		
J	KELSALL, GH; SAVAGE, S; BRANDT, D								CYANIDE OXIDATION AT NICKEL ANODES .2. VOLTAMMETRY AND COULOMETRY OF NI/CN-H2O SYSTEMS								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				138	1			117	124		10.1149/1.2085520				JAN 1991	1991	Coulometric experiments with a Ni plate electrode in 1 kmol NaOH m-3 containing 10(-4)-1 kmol NaCN m-3 showed that cyanide could be oxidized at high current efficiency [greater-than-or-equal-to 2 mol e-(mol CN-)-1] with negligible nickel dissolution. However, current densities were low for potentials below those at which Ni(OH2) was oxidized to Ni(OH)3, when oxygen evolution occurred, causing a sharp decrease in current efficiency. The electrochemical behavior of nickel in alkaline cyanide solutions was studied by cyclic voltammetry using a rotating (Pt) ring-disk (Ni) electrode system. No cyanide oxidation products were detected at the platinum ring electrode. However, by plating the Pt with Pb from alkaline solution, and using potentials < -1.4V vs. HgO/Hg with cyanide concentrations > 10 mol m-3, species other than oxygen (reduction) and hydrogen (oxidation) generated by the nickel disk electrode could be detected transiently, prior to passivation. From thermodynamic calculations for Ni-CN-H2O systems in the preceding paper, the most likely species involved were predicted to be Ni(CN)4(2-) ions, formed by reduction of Ni(OH)3 and the simultaneous oxidative dissolution of the underlying metal. The reaction(s) was observed only on the negative-going potential sweep of the nickel disk; no nickel dissolution was found to have occurred when the electrode was anodically polarized at constant potentials due to the presence of Ni(CN)2/Ni(OH)2 adsorbed on the electrode, as predicted from the thermodynamic calculations.									30	0	0	0	4	1	30			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:A1991EQ83100017		
J	Thomas, Luke W.; Ashcroft, Margaret								The Contextual Essentiality of Mitochondrial Genes in Cancer								FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY				9						695351	10.3389/fcell.2021.695351				OCT 22 2021	2021	Mitochondria are key organelles in eukaryotic evolution that perform crucial roles as metabolic and cellular signaling hubs. Mitochondrial function and dysfunction are associated with a range of diseases, including cancer. Mitochondria support cancer cell proliferation through biosynthetic reactions and their role in signaling, and can also promote tumorigenesis via processes such as the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The advent of (nuclear) genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 deletion screens has provided gene-level resolution of the requirement of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes (NEMGs) for cancer cell viability (essentiality). More recently, it has become apparent that the essentiality of NEMGs is highly dependent on the cancer cell context. In particular, key tumor microenvironmental factors such as hypoxia, and changes in nutrient (e.g., glucose) availability, significantly influence the essentiality of NEMGs. In this mini-review we will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the contribution of NEMGs to cancer from CRISPR-Cas9 deletion screens, and discuss emerging concepts surrounding the context-dependent nature of mitochondrial gene essentiality.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2296-634X			WOS:000716471900001	34746119

In the absence of reactants the alumina support is found to transform into boehmite within 4 h, leading to a reduction in support surface area, sintering of the supported Pt nanoparticles, and a reduction of active metal surface area. Addition of aromatic oxygenates to mimic the compounds typically obtained by lignin depolymerization leads to a slower transformation of the support oxide. These compounds, however, were not able to slow down the decrease in dispersion of the Pt nanoparticles. Vanillin and guaiacol stabilize the aluminum oxide more than phenol, anisole, and benzaldehyde because of the larger number of oxygen functionalities that can interact with the alumina. Interestingly, catalyst samples treated in the presence of lignin showed almost no formation of boehmite, no reduction in support or active metal surface area, and no Pt nanoparticle sintering. Furthermore, in the absence of lignin-derived aromatic oxygenates, ethanol forms a coke-like layer on the catalyst, while oxygenates prevent this by adsorption on the support by coordination via the oxygen functionalities.									64	0	0	0	4	0	64			2155-5435			WOS:000315707700025

In present work a novel environment friendly hydrogen producing technique based on nascently invented Hydroelectric cell has been reported. Hydroelectric cell is one of the unique non-polluting H-2 gas generation methods compared to photo-biosynthesis, photo-electro-catalysis and thermo-chemical etc. Spontaneous dissociation of water molecule by Hydroelectric cell (HEC) has led this study for effective production of hydrogen gas. Moreover, a nanoporous lithium substituted magnesium ferrite used in HEC dissociates water molecule to produce hydrogen without using any electrolyte and light. Ferrite pellet combined with zinc and silver electrodes known as hydroelectric cell produces zinc hydroxide and hydrogen gas as a result of redox reaction. Nanoporous and oxygen deficient ferrite pellet has been synthesised with optimized processing conditions. Maximum average nanopore size distribution has been obtained 3.8 nm by N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherm. Surface dangling bonds of unsaturated cations and oxygen vacancies in ferrite chemidissociate water molecule into hydroxide and hydronium ion. High purity hydrogen gas is produced continuously by applying different external voltage only on hydroelectric cell. Collected gas has been analysed by gas chromatography in comparison to pure reference hydrogen gas. This technique has produced hydrogen in large quantity 1.856 mmol/h compared to existing photocatalytic active ferrite methods. Hydrogen gas generation by HEC is an exclusively facile, low cost and novel technique. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

With an interpenetrating network structure of conductive skeleton of graphene and highly continuous porous channels, the 3DG composites can not only ensure efficient electron and ion transport, but also retain structural stability of electrode materials during the electrochemical reactions. Rapidly growing efforts are seen in the design and synthesis of various 3DG composites with novel structures for diverse electrochemical energy storage devices in recent years. To promote deeper understanding and inspire further development of this exciting class of materials, the recent progress on preparation strategies of 3DG composites with applications in electrochemical energy storage is reviewed. A particular emphasis is placed on the detailed physicochemical mechanisms about the synthesis and structural evolution of 3DG composites and their impact on the electrochemical performance. As a conclusion, a brief perspective on future opportunities and challenges is given.									33	1	0	0	3	0	34			2196-7350			WOS:000441125500021

Ameliorating the interparticle charge transport by H-2 annealing, the solar photocurrent of the SrTaO2N(H) granular film at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) is increased by approximate to 250% in comparison with the SrTaO2N film. Using an aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscope and super-X energy dispersive spectroscopy, the atomic scale observation has proved a decrease of oxygen concentrations in the surface of SrTaO2N(H) particle, which may allow its electrical conductivity to be increased from 0.77 x 10(-6) to 2.65 x 10(-6) S cm(-1) and therefore the charge separation efficiency has been greatly increased by approximate to 330%. After being modified by Co-Pi water oxidation catalyst, the SrTaO2N(H) photoanode shows a solar photocurrent of 1.1 mA cm(-2) and an incident photo-to-current efficiency value of approximate to 20% at 400-460 nm and 1.23 V versus RHE, which suggests that it is a new promising photoanode material for solar water splitting.									67	5	0	0	5	0	68			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000387145300013

High activity and good stability of bifunctional electrocatalysts are very critical for Zn-air cell. Herein, Co particles embedded in highly porous N-doping carbon nanocube (Co/HP-NC) has been successfully fabricated by pyrolyzing bimetallic Co/Zn-zeolitic-imidazolate framework (ZIF) and further evenly loaded with metallic Ru nanoparticles to obtain Ru-coated Co/HP-NC (Ru@Co/HP-NC). Benefiting from introduction of Zn, Ru@Co/HP-NC shows the large pore volume, small Co particles, high surface contents of Co4N and pyridinic/graphitic N. Furthermore, theoretical and experimental results further demonstrate that synergy of Ru coating with Co/HP-NC can greatly improve the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/ OER) property of Ru@Co/HP-NC. Furthermore, Ru@Co/HP-NC based Zn-air batteries present the high open circuit potential of 1.4 V, large power density of similar to 210 mWcm(-2), high discharge capacity (791 mAh g(-1)) and super-long cycling life (similar to 475 cycles) with small overpotantials (similar to 0.89 V). Notably, flexible Zn-air cell with Ru@Co/HP-NC cathode also displays excellent flexibility and superior cycling stability under different bending conditions. The work provides the simple and reliable way to prepare high-efficient electrocatalysts for high-performance metal-air systems.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2566-6223		WOS:000712261900001		
J	Gassie, Lucien W.; Englehardt, James D.					Gassie, Lucien/0000-0002-0233-9257			Mineralization of greywater organics by the ozone-UV advanced oxidation process: kinetic modeling and efficiency								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY				5	11			1956	1970		10.1039/c9ew00653b				NOV 1 2019	2019	Ozone-UV advanced oxidation treatment can mineralize total organic carbon (TOC) in water without the addition of chemicals, representing an alternative to phase-transfer processes such as reverse osmosis for water reuse. However, efficiency is governed by competing principal reaction pathways, and limited information has been available for optimizing treatments in such applications. In this study, a 1.2 m(3) per day (320 GPD) pilot ozone-UV greywater reuse system was tested using simulated and real shower water, and the resulting kinetic data were used to develop a kinetic model of TOC mineralization. H2O2 is produced by photolysis with ozone, and subsequent reactions produce hydroxyl radicals, which mineralize TOC. TOC mineralization efficiency is governed by TOC concentration (controlling transmissivity), pH throughout the treatment, ozone-UV dose ratio, and the evolution of pH due to CO2 production from TOC, which impacts oxidative efficiency dynamically. Modeled hydroxyl radical concentrations were similar to 10(-10) M, as expected during water treatment and reuse, and the second order rate constant for the reaction of hydroxyl radicals with TOC was [1.7-7.6] x 10(7) M-1 s(-1), similar to others reported for the mineralization of wastewater organics. The minimum electrical energy for commercial UV and ozone equipment was assessed at 3.73 kW h per order per m(3) of TOC mineralization, and modeling indicated a wide range of optimal dosing ratios. Treatment efficiency was found to depend strongly on a reactor design that ensures an influent TOC concentration low enough to allow the effective transmission of UV radiation. Further development of the kinetic model to account dynamically for pH evolution as a function of TOC mineralization, reactor hydraulics, and mixing is recommended.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			2053-1400	2053-1419		WOS:000492992100012

The photosynthetic machinery, potentially the main source of damaging reactive oxygen species during cessation of CO2 fixation in desiccating cells, must be protected to avoid sustained photodamage. We compared certain photosynthetic parameters and the response to excess light of BCS-inhabiting, desiccation-tolerant cyanobacteria Leptolyngbya ohadii and Nostoc reinholdii with those observed in the "model" organisms Nostoc sp. PCC 7120, able to resurrect after mild desiccation, and Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 that are unable to recover from dehydration. Desiccation-tolerant strains exhibited a transient decline in the photosynthetic rate at light intensities corresponding to the inflection point in the PI curve relating the 02 evolution rate to light intensity. They also exhibited a faster and larger loss of variable fluorescence and profoundly faster Q(A)(-) re-oxidation rates after exposure to high illumination. Finally, a smaller difference was found in the temperature of maximal thermoluminescence signal in the absence or presence of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) than observed in "model" cyanobacteria. These parameters indicate specific functional differences of photosystem II (PSII) between desiccation tolerant and sensitive cyanobacteria. We propose that exposure to excess irradiation activates a non-radiative electron recombination route inside PSII that minimizes formation of damaging singlet oxygen in the desiccation-tolerant cyanobacteria and thereby reduces photodamage.

In order to improve heat-resistance of Si-Ti-C-0 fiber, the fiber with lower oxygen content than that of commercial kinds has been developed using the electron irradiation curing process. The Si-Ti-C-O fiber with 6%O has been synthesized, and the crystal structure was amorphous containing microcrystallines. The pyrolysis rate of the fiber was measured with a thermobalance at temperatures from 1573 to 1973 K in an argon stream. The pyrolysis products were investigated by X-ray diffraction, SEM and TEM observation. Results are compared with that of commercial Si-Ti-C-0 fibers with 18%O and 13%O.The amorphous Si-Ti-C-0 fiber crystallized to beta-SiC and TiC, with evolution of SiO and CO. The activation energy was 357 kJ/mol for fiber with 6%O, and the crystallization was determined by the crystal growth of SiC controlled by the diffusion of carbon in the fiber. Lowering of oxygen content in Si-Ti-C-0 fiber by the electron irradiation curing process was found to effective for the suppression of pyrolysis.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0021-4876	1880-6880		WOS:A1994MZ05600017

The obtained CdS/NS-rGO nanocomposites exhibit ultra-high photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution and 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) reduction under visible light (lambda >= 420 nm). Their activity could also be adjusted by changing the doping amount of S and N, or by changing the ratios between CdS and NS-rGO. The optimum percentage of NS-rGO is 5 wt%, at which CdS/NS-rGO photocatalyst could achieve the highest H-2 evolution rate of 1701 mu mol h(-1) g(-1). Moreover, the reduction from 4-NP to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) could be completed within only 6 min over this optimized composite. NS-rGO here could provide more active sites as well as tune the band gap structure to increase the photo-activity. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that NS-rGO has a small Gibbs free energy for H* adsorption (Delta G(H)), which could increase the utilization efficency of photo-generated electrons for H-2 generation. NS-rGO is therefore an idea alternate cocatalyst of noble metals for new photocatalysts development.									58	4	0	0	9	0	59			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000437965900023

However, the performance of ZABs is largely limited according to the activity of oxygen electrocatalysts. Precious metal Pt-based catalysts are often used together with Ru- or Ir-based catalysts for rechargeable ZABs. However, the high price and scarce resources limit their commercialized production. Metal-organic framework (MOF) materials have been considered as a valuable candidate for cathode material of ZAB due to their suitable price, unique porous crystal structure and adjustable chemical characteristics. However, the poor electrical conductivity and insufficient chemical stability severely limit their applications in electrocatalysis. In this work, the recent development of MOF-derived carbonbased non-noble metal carbon materials as cathode catalysts for rechargeable ZABs including morphology design, chemical composition and electrochemical performance is reviewed. The catalytic mechanism of MOF-based non-noble metal carbon materials is systematically summarized, and the main points determining the electrochemical performance of MOF-derived carbon-based non-noble metal electrocatalysts are discussed in detail. Promising strategies for improving bifunctional catalytic activity are then highlighted. Finally, the sustainability research, challenges and prospects of MOF-derived carbon-based non-noble metal materials used in ZABs are proposed. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

It is used in a favorable peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation oxidation system to enhance Orange I (OI) degradation. The effects of dopant contents, different water conditions and the reusability are conducted to evaluate the removal efficacy of PMS catalytic over Fe@O-CN in water. Moreover, OI degradation is almost stable under several typical anions (H2PO4- Cl(-)and HCO3-) and humic acid existence. Theoretical calculation results reveal that effective-directional transfer of electrons is obtained by Fe@O-CN, building the formation of high electron density areas around Fe and O. The quenching tests display that O-2(-) and O-1(2) are responsible for OI removal, and SO4- and center dot OH only donate a very small contribution. The electron transfer between electron-rich Fe, O element and HSO5- cycles facilitate HSO5- activation to generate reactive oxygen species. After co-doping, DFT calculations confirm the stronger binding energy, greater charge transferability and longer O-O bond length for PMS activation in Fe@O-CN/PMS system. Our findings provide a valuable insight for the development of efficient catalysts for PMS activation via metal and nonmetal co-doping, which display a promising application for polluted aquatic environment.

Electrochemical characterisations of UO(2) pellets were performed by linear sweep voltammetry at 10 mV/s and reduction waves associated to oxide direct reduction were observed at a potential 150 mV more positive in comparison to the solvent reduction. Subsequent, galvanostatic electrolyses runs were carried out and products were characterised by SEM-EDX, EPMA/WDS, XRD and microhardness measurements. In one of the runs, uranium oxide was partially reduced and three phases were observed: nonreduced UO(2) in the centre, pure metallic uranium on the external layer and an intermediate phase representing the initial stage of reduction taking place at the grain boundaries. In another run, the UO(2) sample was fully reduced. Due to oxygen removal, the U matrix had a typical coral-like structure which is characteristic of the pattern observed after the electroreduction of solid oxides.

The results show that the addition of biomass during low-temperature pyrolysis was found to promote the collapse of macro-pores, leading to the formation of more fine meso-pores in chars. As a stabilizer the hydrogen atoms produced from the pyrolysis of biomass samples reacted with the radical fragments which inhibited the polymerization, and resulted in an increase in the tar and gases yields. The effect of hydrogen from co-pyrolysis on the chemical structure of char was obvious. The combustion reactivity of co-pyrolysis chars was lower than that of lignite char, indicating that the content of volatile is more important than the pore structure and oxygen-containing groups to combustion reactivity for biomass/lignite char obtained from low-temperature co-pyrolysis.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0010-2202	1563-521X		WOS:000464623100001

Lamivudine was selected as the model contaminant to evaluate the electro-chemical performance of the Yb-GO-PbO2 electrode, and it was found that the Yb-GO-PbO2 electrode could obviously enhance the degradation of lamivudine compared with the PbO2 electrode. Meanwhile, the Yb-GO-PbO2 electrode was systematically characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD), which showed that the Yb-GO-PbO2 electrode processed a denser surface, smaller crystal size, and a greater proportion of hydroxyl oxygen species. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the Yb-GO-PbO2 electrode processes many prominent features compared to the PbO2 electrode, such as larger electrochemically active surface area, smaller charge transfer resistance, and higher oxygen evolution potential. The effects of lamivudine initial concentration, current density, electrolyte concentration, and initial pH on the degradation of lamivudine were studied and analyzed. The removal rates of lamivudine and COD reached 99.6% and 65.1%, respectively, when treated for 120 min under optimal process conditions. The electrochemical degradation of lamivudine fitted pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics. The in-termediates of lamivudine degradation were determined using UPLC-MS, and possible degradation pathways of lamivudine were proposed. This paper provides a promising approach for enhancing the electrochemical oxidation performance of PbO2 electrodes by introducing GO and Yb.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000874545700004

They are involved in many fundamental biological processes such as photoreception, electron transport, gas transport and also as cofactors for enzymatic reactions. As regulators of protein activity, tetrapyrroles mediate cellular response to light, oxygen and nutrient levels in the surrounding environment. Biosynthesis of haem tetrapyrroles shares, conserved pathways and enzymes among all three domains of life. This is contrasted by chlorophyll biosynthesis that is only present in eubacteria and chloroplasts, or cobalamin biosynthesis that is only present in eubacteria and archaea. This implicates haem as the most ancient, and chlorophyll as the most recent, of the common tetrapyrroles that are currently synthesized by existing organisms. Haem and chlorophyll are both toxic when synthesized in excess over apo-proteins that bind these tetrapyrroles. Accordingly, the synthesis of these tetrapyrroles has to be tightly regulated and coordinated with apo-protein production. The mechanism of regulating haem and chlorophyll synthesis has been studied intensively in Rhodobacter species and will be discussed.									29	1	0	0	25	0	30			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000320105200008

Synthesis of Fe-N-C catalysts possessing both Fe-N-x sites and Fe clusters and investigation of their catalytic mechanism are essential but challenging. Herein, the controlled synthesis of a model catalyst is successfully achieved using Fe(II)-phenanthroline (Phen) complexes as the only precursor. Through a solid-phase preparation process, Fe-Phen complexes are synthesized on the surface of silica that is used as a hard template for introducing porosity into the carbon structure. The high density of Fe centers facilitates the simultaneous generation of single atomic Fe-N-x sites and Fe clusters, severe aggregation of which is impeded by the silica template. The as-prepared catalyst delivers an efficient ORR performance in an alkaline environment. Combining with computational analysis, the synergistic catalytic mechanism between the Fe-N-x sites and Fe clusters is revealed that the neighboring Fe clusters can increase the adsorption energy of OOH* on the Fe atom of Fe-N-x sites and lower the energy barrier for the formation of the OOH intermediate, thus accelerating the catalytic process. This study provides insights into the future design and synthesis of efficient Fe-N-C catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2052-1553			WOS:000818090500001

The all-carbon ring formations and volatile gas production during the heating and carbonization for 9 PAN/PBO blend precursors with varying mixing ratios are studied via the ReaxFF reactive molecular dynamics simulations. Evolutions of oxygen-containing (O-containing) and nitrogen-containing (N-containing) groups are detailed, in order to reveal the reaction mechanisms of the O and N-based CF precursors. Particularly, the O-containing groups are identified to be more efficient for initiating the carbonization, whereas N-containing groups are far longer retained in the graphitic materials and play a key role in capturing and converting carbon radical species into the graphitic networks. Additionally, the PAN/PBO blend precursor with a mole ratio of 1:1 is compared with the pre-oxidized PAN, PAN, and PBO. It is found that the PAN/PBO blends could be a promising alternative for the cost-effective PAN-based CF precursors, since they can decrease the cost of the CF production by means of: (a) eliminating the pre-oxidation process, (b) having considerable all-carbon ring formations within a short period, and (c) having a relatively fast conversion rate, reaching 95% 6-membered carbon ring formation.

This method incorporates the integration of hydrodynamic equations of matter, equations of beta-processes and thermonuclear reactions kinetics, and the solution of transfer equations for different kinds of neutrino with allowance for the dependence of radiation intensities on the direction of motion and energy of particles. The calculations are carried out in the one-group energy approximation and compared to those obtained earlier by Nadyozhin (1978). The main result of this work is the presence of a narrow peak with a characteristic width of similar to 10 ms in the light curve, which enables one to determine the upper bound on the rest mass of electron neutrino at a level of similar to 2 eV in the case of detection of neutrinos produced by the gravitational collapse in our Galaxy. The major fraction (similar to 90%) of the gravitational binding energy is radiated in the succeeding similar to 20 s, i.e., over a fairly long time interval, as in Nadyozhin calculations (1978). We also calculated the collapse of stellar core with rapid initial solid-body rotation using the spherically symmetric approximation with averaging of the centrifugal force over the solid angle. Parameters of a rapidly and differentially rotating finite-sized neutron star point to the possibility of the stellar core to fragment in the course of the collapse.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1063-7737			WOS:000077612100002

The vertical profile of dissolved sulfides, including H2S and HS- (I H2S) pound, and the CH4 concentrations in the water column and interstitial water of bottom sediment were investigated monthly during a period when hypersaturated DO water was delivered at a depth of 13.8 m. The area near the bottom was identified as oxic. H2S is easily and rapidly oxidized in an oxic environment through a chemical reaction with DO. Although the concentration of CH4 in the experimental area was 95 % lower than that in the control area, CH4 was detected, even though 20-220 % DO was observed near the bottom, where no H2S was detected. We can therefore confirm that supplying hypersaturated DO can improve the water quality, as well as the ecosystem, by preventing the evolution of H2S.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1860-1871	1860-188X		WOS:000358062500004

This study provides the first prediction of hot oxygen corona structure and the associated photochemical loss from a 1 bar CO2-dominated atmosphere of a Venus-like rocky exoplanet, where dissociative recombination of O-2 (+) ions is assumed to be the major source reaction for the escape of neutral O atoms and formation of the hot O corona (or exospheres) as on Mars and Venus. We employ a 3D Monte Carlo code to simulate the exosphere of Proxima Centauri b (PCb) based on the ionosphere simulated by a 3D magnetohydrodynamic model. Our simulation results show that variability of the stellar wind dynamic pressure over one orbital period of PCb does not affect the overall spatial structure of the hot O corona but contributes to the change in the global hot O escape rate that varies by an order of magnitude. The escape increases dramatically when the planet possesses its intrinsic magnetic fields as the ionosphere becomes more extended with the presence of a global magnetic field. The extended hot O corona may lead to a more extended H exosphere through collisions between thermal H and hot O, which exemplifies the importance of considering nonthermal populations in exospheres to interpret future observations.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000732437800001

Isotopic alteration is spatially coincident with mineralization and puts minimum constraints on hydrothermal fluid infiltration outside of visible indicators (i.e., carbonate dissolution and silicification). Additionally, O-18 depletion is nearly homogeneous at hand-specimen scale indicating near-complete alteration of limestone protolith. The primary mechanism of isotopic exchange is coupled dissolution-precipitation leading to pseudomorphic replacement of calcite during hydrothermal fluid infiltration. Surface reactions between calcite and the hydrothermal fluids are evidenced by textural and chemical variations between altered and unaltered calcite in wall-rock limestone and limestone breccia. Cathodoluminescence (CL) reveals distinct changes in the luminescence of altered calcite relative to unaltered equivalent calcite, and laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) data from altered and unaltered calcite show that observed CL responses are due to changes in calcite mineral chemistry. Altered samples exhibit bright CL responses in calcite with increases in Mn and Fe. In addition to wall-rock calcite alteration, calcite veins without clear paragenetic relationships can be related to hydrothermal alteration owing to 18O depletion, CL response, and positive Eu* anomalies. Together, isotopic alteration of wall-rock calcite and evidence of hydrothermal calcite veins define the distal expression of low-temperature hydrothermal alteration in calcite-bearing rocks at the Banshee deposit.									23	2	0	0	0	0	23			0361-0128	1554-0774		WOS:000386566200004

Understanding the oxidation behavior of SiC NWs at high temperatures is essential for their practical applications. Herein, we investigated the oxidation behavior of SiC NWs at 900-1200 degrees C in air. Two oxidation stages were found, including an initial stage controlled by the reaction between oxygen and SiC at the SiO2/SiC interface and a subsequent oxygen diffusion-dependent stage. The oxide scale thickness was strongly influenced by the radius of the SiC NWs. With the increase of the NW radius from 40 to 120 nm, the oxidation activation energy of the oxidation process increases from 84.05 to 98.32 kJ/mol. The thermal insulation performances of SiC NWA, which is composed of SiC NWs, have been improved after oxidation. The evolution of the thermal insulation performance of SiC NWA during oxidation is consistent with the trends of the growth of the amorphous oxide layer, which indicates that exploring the oxidation kinetics is of great significance in understanding the high-temperature behavior of SiC NW-based materials. The present work provides insight into exploring the size effects on oxidation of SiC NWs, which may be helpful to further understanding the high-temperature applications of SiC NWA.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000851057800001

A confirmation for the three-function model of HC-SCR using the temperature programmed methods and in situ DRIFTS								APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL				142				268	277		10.1016/j.apcatb.2013.05.030				OCT-NOV 2013	2013	This paper deals with the selective catalytic reduction of NO with the use of toluene as a reducer and in the presence of excess oxygen. The three-function model of HC-SCR of NO has been studied over ceria-zirconia supported copper oxide (CuO/CeZrO2). The particular functions of CuO/CeZrO2 catalyst have been proved by the catalytic runs carried out in temperature-programmed conditions (TPSR) and in situ DRIFTS. On the basis of obtained results it was observed that NO is oxidized by O-2 to NO2, which is subsequently used for toluene activation. Obtained oxygenates (CxHyOz) clean the active sites from oxygen, which was left during NO reduction to N-2. The DRIFTS studies have shown that NO adsorbs on the surface of ceria-zirconia forming (i) the bridging nitrate when the adsorption of NO is carried out in the absence of gaseous O-2 and (ii) both nitrite and nitrate species when the adsorption is carried out in the presence of O-2. Formation of these surface species can be due to the presence of surface peroxide species (O-2(2-)) or superoxide species (O2-). The presence of the latter enhances NO adsorption and influences the evolution of surfaces species during temperature programmed reaction. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of the applied current (I) and cell voltage (U) on the Figures of Merit (fractional conversion, current efficiency, space-time yield and specific energy consumption) for the Cr(III) to Cr(VI) electrochemical oxidation is analyzed. As both I and U parameters increase, the current efficiency (phi) for the electrochemical oxidation of Cr(III) is decreased due to the oxygen evolution side reaction, which causes an increment in the specific energy consumption (E-s). On the other hand, an increment of the values of I and U leads to greater values of both Cr(III) fractional conversion (X) and space-time yield (eta) due to the oxygen turbulence-promoting action. Comparing the results obtained under both operation modes, in galvanostatic operation higher values of X, eta and phi coupled with lower values of Es are obtained. Hence, working in galvanostatic operation at a relatively low applied current (1.5A) is the optimum option since the energy consumed is quite low, the current efficiency is relatively high and the amount of Cr(VI) recovered is close to 70%.									2	0	0	0	0	1	3			1452-3981			WOS:000290097000021

Despite having been developed only recently, transition metal selenides (TMSes) have emerged as rapidly growing electrocatalysts due to their tunable bandgap, atom environments, and electronic structures, as well as multiphase structures with different conductivities. On ac-count of the lack of guiding reviews, this progress report summarizes the synthetic methods, modulation stra-tegies, structure-performance correlations, and the corresponding emerging electrocatalytic activities of TMSes. First, we focus on discussing the state-of-the-art synthetic strategies and techniques in engineering nano -structured and electrocatalytic TMSes. Particularly, we give detailed pathways for tuning their catalytic atoms and bond microenvironments, including phase modulation, construction of heterojunction, defect engineering, and element doping. Furthermore, the representative electrocatalytic applications and breakthroughs of struc-tured TMSes for efficient and eco-friendly energy conversion technologies have been briefly discussed, such as water splitting, O-2 reduction, CO2 reduction, and N2 reduction. Overall, this cutting-edge and comprehensive review will offer multidisciplinary guidance on discussing the experimental and theoretical progress of TMSes and unveiling the current critical challenges for their future developments in electrocatalytic energy conversion systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000850859700001

The electrochemical production of H2O2 via the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2eORR) is a promising approach for the replacement of the industrial anthraquinone process because it opens the possibility to produce hydrogen peroxide using renewable energies. Classical off-line characterize techniques for the detection of hydrogen peroxide are not suitable for dynamic conditions. To quantify the efficiency of the peroxide formation we developed a novel on-line analysis setup based on the spectrophotometric analysis with titanium oxysulfate, which allows the determination of hydrogen peroxide continuously at the moment it is formed. With our setup, the concentration is continuously measured and the influence of varying process parameter can be directly monitored. We validated the setup with load flexibility experiments, were rectangular current load steps by 33.3% above and below a reference load were performed within an electrolyzer. The evolution of the hydrogen peroxide concentration was directly measurable within 35 s and 95% of the main H2O2 concentration was detectable after 2 min. The applied load steps led to no visible performance decrease of the electrolyzer and faraday efficiencies of > 98% with a maximum production rate of 122.4 mg cm-2h-1 were reached in 0.1 M H2SO4 + 0.05 M K2SO4 for current densities up to -200 mA cm-2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000692249500010

The mechanism was found to involve two successive bielectronic steps with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as the reaction intermediate whatever the electrode material used. On Au, O-2 and H2O2 were reduced at close potentials. The determination of the kinetic parameters of O-2 electroreduction was thus achieved after removing the cathodic current corresponding to H2O2 reduction. Cyclic voltammograms exhibited one cathodic peak whose both current density (j(p)) and potential (E-p) evolution as a function of potential scan rate (r) was in accordance with Randles-Sevcik and Nicholson-Shain equations, respectively. Rotating disk electrode (RDE) voltammetry was also performed and the data were analyzed using the Koutecky-Levich relationship. The effective number of electrons (n) was found to be roughly independent of the potential and close to n = 2 when removing H2O2 reduction current whereas it gradually increased up to n = 4 while considering the total current. The Tafel slopes allowed the cathodic transfer coefficients (beta n) to be calculated in several neutral aqueous electrolytes. Values varied from 0.25 to 0.49 and were systematically higher on Au than on GC electrode. Similar results were obtained with Tafel slopes deduced from Butler-Volmer exploitation of the current-potential curves.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1452-3981			WOS:000326961400021

The advanced identical location transmission electron microscopy (IL-TEM) method was applied to probe the structure evolution of the Pt/CNT catalysts in the reaction. The results indicate that Pt NPs supported on CNTs with a high amount of nitrogen doping (Pt/H-NCNTs) afford 2-fold activity to that of Pt NPs supported on CNTs with oxygen functional groups (Pt/oCNTs) and 4-fold to that of the commercial Pt NPs supported on active carbon (Pt/C) catalyst toward nitrobenzene. The catalytic performance of Pt/H-NCNTs remained constant during four cycles, whereas the activity of the Pt/oCNTs was halved at the second cycle. Compared with Pt/oCNTs, Pt/H-NCNTs exhibited a higher selectivity (>99%) in chemoselective hydrogenation of halonitrobenzenes to haloanilines due to the electron-rich chemical state of Pt NPs. The strong metal support interaction along with the electron-donor capacity of nitrogen sites on H-NCNTs are capable of stabilizing the Pt NPs and achieving related catalytic recyclability as well as approximately 100% selectivity. The catalyst also delivers exclusively selective hydrogenation toward nitro groups for a wide scope of substituent nitroarenes into their corresponding anilines.									120	16	0	0	4	0	126			2155-5435			WOS:000387306100066		
J	Sriram, Sundarraj; Mathi, Selvam; Vishnu, Bakthavachalam; Karthikeyan, B.; Jayabharathi, Jayaraman								Ultra-Durability and Enhanced Activity of Amorphous Cobalt Anchored Polyaniline Synergistic towards Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation								CHEMISTRYSELECT				7	8					e202104516	10.1002/slct.202104516				FEB 24 2022	2022	Cobalt anchored polyaniline electrocatalysts (Co@PANI) have been synthesized (Co@PANI-200, Co@PANI-400, Co@PANI-600, Co@PANI-800) and characterised. The electrical conductivity and stability of Co@PANI increased due to the synergistic effect of PANI and cobalt content. PANI prevents aggregation and show strong binding with cobalt ions. The Co@PANI-600/GC shows low overpotential of 341 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2) current density and the Tafel slope of Co@PANI-600 (39 mV dec(-1)) was smaller than IrO2 (98 mV dec(-1)) for OER. The calculated turnover frequency (TOF) of Co@PANI-600/GC (0.01609 s(-1)) was approximate to 8 times higher than IrO2 (0.0014 s(-1)) at 1.60 V. Furthermore, the Co@PANI-600/NF electrocatalyst shows an incredibly low overpotential of 251 mV @10 mA cm(-2). This new born Co@PANI-600/NF exhibits durability over 250 h with only 5.1 % potential loss in alkaline medium. Co@PANI-600 catalyst exhibits excellent OER performances as well as having enough kinetics to solve the sluggish rate of water oxidation. At 1.54 V, the solar driven water electrolysis demonstration supports the efficiency of new born electrocatalyst in solar to hydrogen conversion. These research findings confirm that Co@PANI-600 can be used for large-scale hydrogen generation at the lowest possible cost.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2365-6549			WOS:000760360800030

The stability of these nanoengineered open structures is tested under two accelerated degradation test conditions (ADT), particularly selected to mimic the potential regimes experienced by the catalyst during the operative life of a fuel cell (i.e., load cycles (up to 1.0 V-RHE) and start-up cycles (up to 1.4 V-RHE)). To understand the evolution of the electrochemical performance, the catalyst properties are investigated by means of fundamental rotating disc electrode studies, identical location-transmission electron microscopy (IL-TEM) coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy chemical mapping (IL-EELS), and post-use chemical analysis and online highly sensitive potential resolved dissolution concentration monitoring by scanning flow cell inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (SFC-ICP-MS). The experimental results on the nanoporous Pt revealed distinctive degradation mechanisms that could potentially affect a wide range of other nanoengineered open structures. The study concludes that, although providing promising activity performance, under the relevant operational conditions of fuel cells, the nanoporosity is only metastable and subjected to a progressive reorganization toward the minimization of the nanoscale curvature. The rate and pathways of this specific degradation mechanism together with other well-known degradation mechanisms like carbon corrosion and platinum dissolution are strongly dependent on the selected upper limit potential, leading to distinctly different durability performance.									98	4	0	0	1	1	98			2155-5435			WOS:000361089700005

The elimination of prolonged cation-exchange submersion dramatically reduced the synthesis time scale from days to minutes. The electrodeposited films were characterized using a combination of X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The prepared birnessite films were crystalline, monophasic oxide materials that contained Mn3+, Mn4+ traces of Mn2+, and the intercalant of choice. Redox-inactive Na+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Y3+, and Zn2+ cations showed minimal influence on the voltammetric behavior of birnessite in the presence of Mn2+(aq). Slightly more significant effects emerged during potential cycling and chronopotentiometry of birnessite films in 0.1 M NaOH. The potential needed to sustain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M NaOH increased according to the sequence Na+ < Ca2+ < Sr2+ < Y3(+) < Zn2+. The sequence, with slight inversions in the order, was reminiscent of the trend in the heterometal-dependent modulation of the half-wave potential of the redox couple Mn3+Mn24+/Mn-3(4+) in nonaqueous solutions of heterometallic manganese-dioxido cluster systems. Unlike the case of the homogeneous cluster catalysts, the electrochemical reactivity of intercalated birnessite films did not vary linearly with the pK(a) of the redox-inactive cations.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1932-7447			WOS:000380735300010

Treatment of the membranes with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-p-belizoquinone (DDQ) converts the native low-spin (LS) form of Cyt b(559) to the high-spin (HS) form characterized with the g = 6.19 and g = 5.95 split signal. The HS Cyt b(559) was pH dependent with the amplitude increasing toward more acidic pH values (pH 5.5-8.5). The HS state was not photochemically active upon 77 and 200 K continuous illumination under our conditions and was characterized by a low reduction potential (less than or equal to 0 V). It was also demonstrated that DDQ treatment damages the oxygen evolving complex, leading to inhibition of oxygen evolution, decrease of the S-state EPR multiline signal and release of Mn2+. In parallel, studies of model systems containing iron(III) protoporphyrin IX chloride (Fe(III)Por), which is a good model compound for the Cyt b(559) prosthetic group, were performed by using optical and EPR spectroscopy. The interaction of Fe(III)Por with imidazole (Im) in weakly polar solvent results in formation of bisimidazole coordinated heme iron (Fe(III)Por Im,) which mimic the bis-histidine axial ligation of Cyt b(559). The reaction of DDQ with the LS Fe(III)Por Im, complex leads to its transformation into the HS state (g-, = 5.95, g(parallel to) = 2.00). It was shown that the spin conversion occurs due to the donor-acceptor interaction of coordinated imidazole with this highpotential quinone causing the displacement of imidazole from the axial position. The similar mechanism of DDQinduced spin change is assumed to be valid for the native membrane Cyt b(559) in PSII centers. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The test was employed for the photo-electrode reaction in the PEC water splitting. Testing procedure included impedance measurements and was carried out in the original three-electrode cell with an alkaline electrolyte where working Ni electrode behaves as an ideal polarized electrode and is in immediate contact with the photoactive powder additive. The application of this test is presented for the UV- and visible light photoactive TiO2-xCx:nC powder. The test of TiO2-xCx:nC powder confirmed that the polarization resistance of the designed electrochemical cell is due only to photoactive powder. The area-specific exchange current density was determined for the photo-electrode reactions on TiO2-xCx:nC powder under UV- and visible light, as well as their ratio. The obtained ratio correlates well with the previous data on the rate constants for the UV- and visible-driven photocatalytic oxidation of a model solution performed in the presence of the same powder TiO2-xCx:nC.

J	Miao, Qinghua; Wang, Lidong; Liu, Zhaoyuan; Wei, Bing; Wang, Jinhui; Liu, Xiangli; Fei, Weidong								Effect of defects controlled by preparation condition and heat treatment on the ferromagnetic properties of few-layer graphene								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				7						5877	10.1038/s41598-017-06224-w				JUL 19 2017	2017	Magnetism in graphene has stimulated extensive studies to search for novel metal-free magnetic device. In this paper, we use a synthesis method far from equilibrium state named self-propagating high temperature synthesis (SHS) to produce few-layer graphene with different defect contents and then use a heat treatment process (vacuum-annealing and air-cooling) to further control the defects in graphene. We find that the type and content of defects in graphene can be controlled by adjusting the mole ratio of reactants (Mg: CaCO3) for SHS reaction and the temperature of the subsequent heat treatment. The deviation of the ratio of reactants from stoichiometric ratio benefits the production of graphene with higher concentration of defects. It is indicated that the temperature of the heat treatment has remarkable influences on the structure of graphene, Raman-sensitive defects can be recovered partly by heat treatment while IR-sensitive defects are closely related with the oxidation and decomposition of the oxygen-containing groups at elevated temperature. This work indicates that SHS is a promising method to produce graphene with special magnetism, and the heat treatment is an effective way to further adjust the magnetism of graphene. This work sheds light on the study to develop carbon materials with controlled ferromagnetism.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2045-2322			WOS:000405895000029	28724998	
J	Wen, Yushi; Zhang, Chaoyang; Xue, Xianggui; Long, Xinping				Zhang, Chaoyang/AAN-2433-2021				Cluster evolution during the early stages of heating explosives and its relationship to sensitivity: a comparative study of TATB, beta-HMX and PETN by molecular reactive force field simulations								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				17	18			12013	12022		10.1039/c5cp00006h				2015	2015	Clustering is experimentally and theoretically verified during the complicated processes involved in heating high explosives, and has been thought to influence their detonation properties. However, a detailed description of the clustering that occurs has not been fully elucidated. We used molecular dynamic simulations with an improved reactive force field, ReaxFF_lg, to carry out a comparative study of cluster evolution during the early stages of heating for three representative explosives: 1,3,5-triamino2,4,6- trinitrobenzene (TATB), beta-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). These representatives vary greatly in their oxygen balance (OB), molecular structure, stability and experimental sensitivity. We found that when heated, TATB, HMX and PETN differ in the size, amount, proportion and lifetime of their clusters. We also found that the clustering tendency of explosives decreases as their OB becomes less negative. We propose that the relationship between OB and clustering can be attributed to the role of clustering in detonation. That is, clusters can form more readily in a high explosive with a more negative OB, which retard its energy release, secondary decomposition, further decomposition to final small molecule products and widen its detonation reaction zone. Moreover, we found that the carbon content of the clusters increases during clustering, in accordance with the observed soot, which is mainly composed of carbon as the final product of detonation or deflagration.									42	3	0	0	3	0	44			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000353767500010	25872486

In addition to this Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM)based Unitized Regenerative Fuel Cell (URFC), other URFC technologies with different electrolytes have also been reported in the literature, which form the basis for emphasis in this part of the review. Unitized Regenerative Alkaline Fuel Cells (UR-AFC) have long been utilized for aerospace applications, while the recent development of Anion Exchange Membrane (AEM) has stimulated their further development, especially on the AEM-based UR-AFCs. Vast research works have been reported on the bifunctional oxygen catalyst development, while the latest UR-AFC prototypes are also being briefly introduced. Despite their potential cost-efficiency and better reactivity, cell performance and round-trip efficiency of the current UR-AFCs are still lower than their PEM-based counterparts. Unitized regenerative solid oxide fuel cell, which is more commonly cited as Reversible Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (RSOFC), is a high-temperature URFC technology with superior performance and reversibility. Review works conducted on this type of URFC are separated into two categories, that is, RSOFC with oxygen ion conducting electrolyte and RSOFC with proton ion conducting electrolyte. Despite the highest efficiency among various URFC technologies, the application of RSOFCs, however, is restricted by their limited long-term stability and poor cycle ability. Unitized regenerative microfluidic fuel cell, also referred to as the reversible microfluidic fuel cell, is a newly-emerging URFC research trend which benefits a lot from its membraneless configuration. However, limited research works have been conducted on this new technology.									105	5	0	0	6	0	109			1364-0321			WOS:000401395000064

The optimum densities corresponded to higher sintering temperatures than the op-timum quality factor, so the ceramics were classified as MTS-xCST-D and MTS-xCST-Q. All compositions exhibited a composite phase consisting of the rhombohedral structure MTS and the orthorhombic structure CST. As the sintering temperature rose, the relative densities of the ceramics increased significantly, while the formation of oxygen vacancies and titanium reduction were intensified. Finally, the x = 0.06 composi-tions sintered at 1425 degrees C (MTS-0.06CST-D) and 1375 degrees C (MTS-0.06CST-Q) had excellent temperature stability and low loss. At low frequency, the change of dielectric permittivity at 25-150 degrees C did not exceed 0.1, and the loss tangent was less than 0.003. In addition, microwave dielectric properties of MTS-0.06CST-D (er = 20.4, Qf = 63,770 GHz, tau(f )= -1.8 ppm/degrees C) and MTS-0.06CST-Q (epsilon(r) = 18.4, Qf = 74,740 GHz, tau(f) = -4.3 ppm/degrees C) compositions were obtained. These results suggest that MST-0.6CST ceramics could be a candidate material for 5 G microwave communication devices. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The catalysts were prepared by homogeneous deposition-precipitation. It was found that Cu-0 particles were formed on the surface of a layered hydrosilicate with the zincsilite structure upon reduction with hydrogen. The reoxidation of the reduced samples with a mixture of oxygen and an inert gas, which contained no more than 0.05 vol % O-2, resulted in the formation of individual Cu2O and CuO phases; copper ions did not return to the hydrosilicate structure. Catalytic tests of Cu-Zn-Si catalysts in methanol synthesis indicate that the specific catalytic activity of copper metal particles grows linearly with increasing zinc loading. This fact suggests that copper metal particles, which were obtained by the reduction of Cu2+ ions from the copper-zinc hydroxo silicate with the zincsilite structure, were responsible for activity in methanol synthesis. Consequently, the ability to return copper ions to a precursor compound in reoxidation with oxygen at low concentrations, which is known for reduced Cu/ZnO catalysts (these catalysts are highly active in methanol synthesis), is not related to the catalytic activity in methanol synthesis.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0023-1584	1608-3210		WOS:000261342700007

Surface energies of the polymer substrates were evaluated by contact angle measurements using Lifshitz-van der Waals acid-base approach. The surface energy of untreated HDPE is mainly contributed by Lifshitz-van der Waals interactions. After 5 min of plasma treatment, hydrogen bonds are formed on the surface, which is reflected in predominant acid-base interactions. The SEM results obtained demonstrate considerable changes of the surface roughness due to different types of the plasma gas used. Evolution of oxygen- or amino-containing moieties was detected by XPS and ATR FT IR. The prepared polyethylene surfaces were used as a basic support for further fabrication of novel hybrid biocomposite sandwich structures.									120	4	0	0	5	1	125			0303-402X	1435-1536		WOS:000186462300003

Herein, we report the syntheses of three iridium-doped zinc-aluminum LDHs (Ir-LDHs) nanomaterials (1-3, with about 80 nm of planar size and a thickness of 8 nm as derived by field emission scanning electron microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction studies, respectively), carried out in the confined aqueous environment of reverse micelles, through a very simple and versatile procedure. These materials exhibit excellent catalytic performances in WO driven by NaIO4 at neutral pH and 25 degrees C, with an iridium content as low as 0.5 mol % (similar to 0.8 wt %), leading to quantitative oxygen yields (based on utilized NaIO4, turnover number up to similar to 10,000). Nanomaterials 1-3 display the highest ever reported turnover frequency values (up to 402 min(-1)) for any heterogeneous and heterogenized catalyst, comparable only to those of the most efficient molecular iridium catalysts, tested under similar reaction conditions. The boost in activity can be traced to the increased surface area and pore volume (>5 times and 1 order of magnitude, respectively, higher than those of micrometric materials of size 0.3-1 mu m) estimated for the nanosized particles, which guarantee higher noble metal accessibility. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) studies suggest that 1-3 nanomaterials, as-prepared and after catalysis, contain a mixture of isolated, single octahedral Ir(III) sites, with no evidence of Ir-Ir scattering from second-nearest neighbors, excluding the presence of IrO2 nanoparticles. The combination of the results obtained from XAS, elemental analysis, and ionic chromatography strongly suggests that iridium is embedded in the brucite-like structure of LDHs, having four hydroxyls and two chlorides as first neighbors. These results demonstrate that nanometric LDHs can be successfully exploited to engineer efficient WOCs, minimizing the amount of iridium used, consistent with the principle of the noble-metal atom economy.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000555417200050	32583657

However, it remains an enormous challenge to design the corresponding bifunctional electrocatalysts with high activity, high selectivity, and longterm stability. Herein, 2D Ni-based nanoarrays grown directly on carbon cloth (CC) substrate (CC@NiO/Ni3S2) were synthesized using a facile one-step electrodeposition technique. The CC@NiO/Ni3S2 consists of ultrathin nanosheets (similar to 3.4 nm) with rich NiO/Ni3S2 heterointerfaces, which not only efficiently exposes more active sites and accelerates mass/charge diffusion, but also provides unique interfacial interactions for charge redistribution to activate the formation of key reaction intermediates. As a result, the CC@NiO/Ni3S2 exhibits a low over potential of 91 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with high catalytic stability for catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). When the Ph-CH2OH oxidation is chosen as the corresponding anodic half-reaction instead of water oxidation, the CC@NiO/Ni3S2 also shows an excellent catalytic activity as well as a high selectivity (over 98%) towards benzoic acid (Ph-COOH), which is a value-added chemical and can be easily separated by crystallization. A two electrode electrolyzer was accordingly constructed using CC@NiO/Ni3S2 as the cathode and anode electrocatalysts for HER and Ph-CH2OH oxidation, respectively, showing stable production of hydrogen fuels and valueadded Ph-COOH. More importantly, the H-2 generation rate is boosted by 2.6 times at 1.609 V by replacing water oxidation with Ph-CH2OH oxidation, which can also save electrical energy of 10.0 % at 50 mA cm(-2). This work offers a facile strategy to develop advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts with abundant heterointerfaces for practical applications in energy-saving hydrogen production.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000772782700004

Here we report the exploration and crystal phase engineering of metallic CoSe2 as cocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The potential of orthorhombic and cubic CoSe2 (i.e. o-CoSe2, c-CoSe2) as cocatalysts are evaluated by theoretical simulation. Experimentally, o-CoSe2 and c-CoSe2 are rationally anchored to ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets, which provides a platform to evaluate the practical photocatalytic activity. The experimental results reveal the crystal phase dependent hydrogen evolution catalysis, i.e., the hydrogen evolution can be proceeded more efficiently on o-CoSe2 surface compared to c-CoSe2. We demonstrate that o-CoSe2 possesses more favorable hydrogen adsorption capacity and can thus tune the rate-determining step, i.e., the surface conversion from H+ to H-2, leading to enhanced performance. The presented results provide insights into the role of phase engineering and a strategy for enhanced catalysis.									24	0	0	0	1	0	24			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000551969200072

In this study, PAN and poly(acrylonitrile-co-itaconic acid)s (PAIs) with different contents of itaconic acid (IA) were prepared through free radical polymerization, and their carbonization behaviors were investigated at different thermal treatment temperatures. As confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses, functional groups containing heteroatoms practically disappeared above 600 degrees C, due to crosslinking, condensation, dehydrogenation, and gas-evolution reactions of the carbonization processes. Deconvolution of the carbon, oxygen and nitrogen peaks from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses revealed the development of ordered and doped graphitic carbons at elevated thermal treatment temperatures. The total yields of PAIs with excess amounts of IA (3 similar to 6 mol%) demonstrated a large carbon loss during the carbonization procedures. PAI with 1 similar to 2 mol% IA afforded carbon materials with a relatively high graphitic carbon content at 1200 degrees C, which is potentially important for electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, carbon materials prepared from PAI with 2 mol% IA at 1200 degrees C exhibited a relatively high content of pyridinic nitrogen, suggesting potentially superior catalytic activity. This study afforded technical guidelines on the structural elements of PAN-based precursors to prepare carbon materials with predesigned characteristics. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, their unsatisfied electrocatalytic performance limits their direct application as electrocatalyst. Herein, by incorporating the cobalt-oxide bonds and polyaniline (PANI) with two-dimension zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), a novel bifunctional catalyst (Co-O-ZIF/PANI) for Zn-air battery was designed based on a facile and eco-friendly method. This Co-O-ZIF/PANI with optimized surface adsorption effect and suitable Co3+/Co2+ ratio, exhibits eminent electrocatalytic activity toward both oxygen reduction and evolution reaction. The as-assembled liquid ZABs based on Co-O-ZIF/PANI achieves a remarkable maximum power density of 123.1 mW cm(-2) and low discharge-charge voltage gap of 0.81 V at 5 mA cm-2 for over 300 cycles. Operando Raman spectroscopy reveals that the excellent performance origins from the optimized surface chemisorption property of O-2 and H2O brought by Co-O bonds and PANI. This work provides a novel prospect to develop efficient MOF derived bifunctional electrocatalysts by optimizing surface chemisorption properties.

Our model depends upon the existence of (i) a peculiar Wre-enrichment phase in the GC's parent galaxy associated with very low-metallicity Type II supernovae (SNe II) and (ii) localized inhomogeneous enrichment from a single Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) and intermediate-mass (4-7 M(circle dot)) asymptotic giant branch field stars. GC formation is then assumed to take place within this chemically peculiar region. Thus, in our model the first low-mass GC stars to form are those with peculiar abundances (i. e. O-depleted and Na-enhanced), while 'normal' stars (i. e. O-rich and Na-depleted) are formed in a second stage when self-pollution from SNe II occurs and the peculiar pollution from the previous phase is dispersed. In this study, we focus on three different GCs: NGC 6752, 6205 (M 13) and 2808. We demonstrate that, within this framework, a model can be constructed which is consistent with (i) the elemental abundance anticorrelations, (ii) isotopic abundance patterns and (iii) the extreme [O/Fe] values observed in NGC 2808 and M 13, without violating the global constraints of approximately unimodal [Fe/H] and C+N+O.									45	0	0	0	0	0	45			0035-8711			WOS:000265509500009

These amorphous nanoparticles are of high interest for production of solar fuels. They facilitate water oxidation in a directly light-driven process using [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) as a photosensitizer and persulfate (S2O82-) as an electron acceptor. By X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the cobalt K-edge, cobalt L-edge and oxygen K-edge, we investigate the light-driven transition from the Co-II/M2P precursor to the active catalyst, which is a layered cobalt(III) oxide with structural similarities to water-oxidizing electrocatalysts. The M2P ligand likely binds at the periphery of the nanoparticles, preventing their further agglomeration during the catalytic reaction. This system opens a possibility to link the catalytically active nanoparticles via a covalent bridge to a photosensitizer and build an artificial photosynthetic system for direct utilization of solar energy for fuel production without production of electricity as an intermediate step.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Photosynthetic and Biomimetic Hydrogen Production.

The CdS nanoparticles are well dispersed on the surface of Ni-Fe LDH to form nanoscale heterojunctions, as suggested from the TEM and elemental mapping images. The composites with optimum CdS amount (15 wt%) take on notably higher hydrogen evolution activity (469 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) than the independent CdS and Ni Fe LDH from aqueous methanol solution under xenon lamp irradiation. The nano-heterojunction notably promotes the H-2 evolution kinetics and greatly suppresses the recombination of photo-induced electrons and holes, which is responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the composites, as demonstrated by the reducing onset potential and increasing photocurrent of the composites in the photoelectrochemical experiments. The possible photocatalytic mechanism is proposed on the basis of the defined position of energy band edges. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Bi1-xSmxVO4 showed two structures with the component content. When the composition was above x = 0.3, Bi1-xSmxVO4 were of single phase with tetragonal type and can be regarded as solid solutions of was BiVO4 and SmVO4. When Bi1-xSmxVO4 was loaded with 0.3 wt% Pt, the samples showed photocatalytic activities for water decomposition to hydrogen under UV light. Among these catalysts, Bi0.5Sm0.5VO4 showed the best photocatalytic activity for water splitting, which indicated synergistic of Bi/Sm enhanced the photocatalysis efficiency. What's more, Bi0.5Sm0.5VO4 loaded with other co-catalysts was found to act as a photocatalyst for water decomposition to hydrogen and oxygen under UV light irradiation, and the photocatalyst loaded with Pt/Cr2O3 had the best photocatalytic property. The amounts of the produced hydrogen and oxygen, respectively, were about 188.25 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) and 95.90 mu mol h(-1) g(-1).

In this work, we studied the promotional effect of O-v on photoelectron transfer in TiO2, using first-principles density functional theory calculations with correction for on-site Coulomb interactions. We explicitly identified three types of O-v with different charge states (i.e., charge-neutral , monovalent , divalent O-v(2+)) via electronic structure analysis. Electron transfer energy calculations revealed that the ionized O-v in anatase TiO2 are able to collect excess electrons whereas those in the rutile phase are not. The presence of ionized O-v further endows anatase TiO2 with directional electron transfer along the [100] orientation, in favor of anatase TiO2(101) for photocatalytic reduction surpassing the (001) termination. After examining various combination modes of ionized O-v involving different charge states and spatial distributions, we demonstrated that the vertical chain in anatase TiO2(101) is the most catalytically effective O-v pattern in TiO2. These results signify the importance of subtle defects in photocatalysis and may assist future photocatalyst design toward higher photocatalytic efficiency.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000691733400001	34525137

In this work, defect-rich and carbondoping Co3O4 nanosheets are successfully prepared through one-step room temperature CH4 plasma. The CH4 plasma can not only etch the surface of Co3O4 to bring intrinsic defects, but also atomically dope carbon into the Co3O4. Benefiting from this defect engineering strategy, the electronic and composition of Co3O4 is modulated with optimized intermediate binding. The formation of oxygen vacancy in Co3O4 can significantly enhance the OER activity and the formation of CoeC bond in Co3O4 can deliver an ideal HER activity. Even more, the synergistic effect of dual-type point defects may further enhance the electrocatalytic activity for both HER and OER. As a result, the as-prepared carbon-doping Co3O4 exhibits low overpotential along with good stability in alkaline media for both HER and OER. This finding will open up a new way to engineer the electronic structure of the metal oxides to design highly efficient bi-functional electrocatalysts. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, due to the sluggish CO2 reduction/evolution reaction (CRR/CER) kinetics, the current Li-CO2 batteries still suffer from severe polarization and poor cycling stability. Herein, we designed and in situ synthesized sea urchinlike Mn2O3-Mn3O4 nanocomposite and explored the synergistic effect between Mn2O3 and Mn3O4 during charge-discharge process in Li-CO2 batteries. It is found that Mn3O4 can effectively promote the kinetics of CRR process, and Mn2O3 can induce the nucleation of Li2CO3 and promote its decomposition (CER). Benefiting from the dual-phase synergy, the Mn2O3-Mn3O4 cathode combines the respective catalytic advantages of the both and delivers a high full discharge capacity of 19 024 mAh g(-1), a low potential gap of 1.24 V, and durable cycling stability (1380 h) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1). Moreover, based on experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a charge-discharge process model of the Mn2O3-Mn3O4 cathode was established to display the electrochemical reaction mechanism. We hope that this design strategy can encourage further studies for efficient cathode catalysts to accelerate the practical application of Li-CO2 batteries and even the metal-air batteries.									24	2	0	0	1	0	25			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000557854700041	32614568

There are a number of different antioxidant enzymes that help plants to cope with these stresses. During stresses, SOD catalyses the removal of center dot O-2(-) by dismutating it into O-2 and H2O2. The CAT converts the H2O2 into water and O-2. POX works in the extracellular space for scavenging H2O2. Plant GPX catalyses the reduction of H2O2 and HO2 to water and lipid alcohols, respectively. GR catalyses the reduction of oxidised glutathione (GSSG; dimeric) to reduced glutathione (GSH; monomeric). APX utilises ascorbate as a specific electron donor to scavenge H2O2 to water.The stationary life of plants has led to the evolution of a complex gridded antioxidant defence system constituting numerous enzymatic components, playing a crucial role in overcoming various stress conditions. Mainly, these plant enzymes are superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POX), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione S-transferases (GST), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), which work as part of the antioxidant defence system. These enzymes together form a complex set of mechanisms to minimise, buffer, and scavenge the reactive oxygen species (ROS) efficiently. The present review is aimed at articulating the current understanding of each of these enzymatic components, with special attention on the role of each enzyme in response to the various environmental, especially abiotic stresses, their molecular characterisation, and reaction mechanisms. The role of the enzymatic defence system for plant health and development, their significance, and cross-talk mechanisms are discussed in detail. Additionally, the application of antioxidant enzymes in developing stress-tolerant transgenic plants are also discussed.									46	0	0	0	23	0	46				2079-7737		WOS:000642730500001	33810535

However, few works have been done on the allelopathic effects between the plants and soil microalgae in BSCs currently. In this study, we investigated the chemical compositions of volatile oil of Artemisia ordosica and its allelopathic effects on photosynthetic system II (PSII) and antioxidant system of Palmellococcus miniatus, a green algae isolated from BSCs. 37 components, consisted of 17 terpenoids, 14 alcohols, 2 esters, 2 ketones and other 2 components were identified in the volatile oil from A. ordosica by GC-MS analysis. High concentration of volatile oil could significantly inhibit the growth and photosynthetic activity (Fv/Fm), and decreased the photosynthetic parameters by affecting photon absorption, electron transport and the reaction center of PSII of P. miniatus, and also cause the significant increase of superoxide dismutase (SOD; EC 1.15.1.) activity, peroxidase (POD; EC 1.11.1.7) activity, reactive oxygen evolution (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents of P. miniatus through the combined effects of components in volatile oil.

J	Mao, Min; Xu, Jing; Li, Yanru; Liu, Zeying					Xu, Jing/0000-0002-6953-4583			Hydrogen evolution from photocatalytic water splitting by LaMnO3 modified with amorphous CoSx								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE				55	8			3521	3537		10.1007/s10853-019-04205-0				MAR 2020	2020	The expansion of the optical response range and the high photoelectron holes separation and the transfer efficiency are prerequisites for the excellent hydrogen evolution performance of the catalyst. In this paper, amorphous CoSx is combined with rare-earth complex LaMnO3 and under the characterization of SEM, TEM, XRD and XPS, the successful synthesis of the composite catalyst was demonstrated; characterization results by UV-Vis, BET and electrochemical workstations show that the composite material exposes more active sites, and the close contact interface formed between the two effectively improves the separation and transmission of photogenerated carriers, and the ability of the composite material to sense light is also significantly enhanced. After optimizing the hydrogen production conditions of the composite catalyst, the hydrogen production under visible light (>= 420 nm) for 5 h reached 458.8 lmol, which was about 6.8 and 4.5 times that of pure LaMnO3 and CoSx, and the hydrogen evolution stability of the material is very good. Studies have shown that amorphous CoSx is a good material that can replace precious metals for hydrogen production.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000509689700026

Achieving high selectivity for the desired products of the CO2RR remains challenging. Herein, a self-redox strategy is developed to construct strong interfacial bonds between Ag nanoparticles and an ultrathin CoAl-layered double hydroxide (U-LDH) nanosheet support, where the surface hydroxyl groups associated with oxygen vacancies of U-LDH play a critical role in the formation of the interface structure. The supported Ag@U-LDH acts as a highly efficient catalyst for CO2 reduction, resulting in a high CO evolution rate of 757 mu mol g(cat)(-1) h(-1) and a CO selectivity of 94.5% under light irradiation. Such a high catalytic selectivity may represent a new record among current photocatalytic CO2RR to CO systems. The Ag-O-Co interface bonding is confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and FTIR CO2 adsorption studies. The in situ FTIR measurements indicate that the formation of the *COOH intermediate is accelerated and the mass transfer is improved during the CO2RR. Density functional theory calculations show that the Ag-O-Co interface reduces the formation energy of the *COOH intermediate and accumulates localized charge. Experimental and theoretical analysis collectively demonstrates that the strong interface bonding between Ag and U-LDH activates the interface structure as catalytically CO2RR active sites, effectively optimizing the binding energies with reacted intermediates and facilitating the CO2RR performance.									16	2	0	0	1	0	16			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000641156600055	33793186

The introduction of a safe and large-scale method of synthesizing a composite of these materials with carbon is of great significance in the fields of electrochemical and materials sciences. In the current effort, we successfully synthesize an iron phosphide/carbon (FeP/C) with a high specific surface area by the pyrolysis of the gel resulting from the hydrothermal treatment of an iron nitrate-phytic acid mixed solution. In comparison with the blank (P/C), the as-synthesized FeP/C appears to be an efficient electrode material for supercapacitor as well as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) applications in an alkaline medium in a three-electrode system. In the study of supercapacitors, FeP/C shows areal capacitance of 313 mF cm(-2) at 1.2 mA cm(-2) while retaining 95% of its initial capacitance value after 10 000 cycles, while in the ORR, the synthesized material exhibits high electrocatalytic activity with an onset potential of ca. 0.86 V vs. RHE through the preferred four-electron pathway and less than 6% H2O2 production calculated in the potential range of 0.0-0.7 V vs. RHE. The stability is found to be better than those of the benchmark Pt/C (20 wt%) catalyst.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8				2046-2069		WOS:000481573800063	35528647

Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic analysis, including homonuclear and heteronuclear correlation NMR experiments (COSY, ROESY, HSQC, and HMBC), and the absolute configurations were determined by circular dichroism and chemical correlations. Their effects on photosynthesis were tested. Sesquiterpene 1 (50 PM) inhibits both light-dependent synthesis of ATP and the electron flow in chloroplasts, whereas at high concentrations the electron flow inhibition was partially reversed. Therefore, 1 behaves as a Hill reaction inhibitor and a weak energy transfer inhibitor and has two targets of interaction: one located at the oxygen-evolving complex, and the other located at the light-activated Mg2+-ATPase. Compound 2 was inactive, whereas 3 acts with the same mechanisms as 1 but was less active. Celastrus vulcanicola J. Donnell Smith (Celastraceae) is a subtropical woody vine distributed in Central America and the Caribbean. Its chemical constituents and biological activity have not yet been investigated.									21	0	0	0	14	1	21			0163-3864	1520-6025		WOS:000258637900003	18616221

The NEXAFS studies were performed from room temperature up to 900 degrees C. The presence of oxygen and nitrogen containing functional groups was observed in C K edge, N K edge, and O K edge NEXAFS spectra of the multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The N K edge spectra revealed three types of pi(*) features, the source of which was decisively identified by their temperature dependent evolution. It was established that these features are attributed to pyridinelike, NO, and graphitelike structures, respectively. The O K edge indicated that both carbonyl (C = O), pi(*)(CO), and ether C-O-C, sigma(*)(CO), functionalities were present. Upon heating in a vacuum to 900 degrees C the pi(*)(CO) resonances disappeared while the sigma(*)(CO) resonances were still present confirming their higher thermal stability. Heating did not produce a significant change in the pi(*) feature of the C K edge spectrum indicating that the tabular structure of the nanotubes is essentially preserved following the thermal decomposition of the functional groups on the nanotube surface.

Their promise is owing to their "special'' structure that gives POMs a truly unique ability to control redox reactions in energy conversion and storage. One such amazing capability is their large number of redox active sites that arises from the complex three-dimensional cluster of metal-oxide ions linked together by oxygen atoms. Here, a critical review on how POMs emerged from being molecular clusters for fundamental studies, to next-generation materials for energy applications is provided. We highlight how exploiting the versatility and activity of these molecules can lead to improved performance in energy devices such as supercapacitors and batteries, and in energy catalyst applications. The potential of POMs across numerous fields is systematically outlined by investigating structure-property-performance relationships and the determinant factors for energy systems. Finally, the challenges and opportunities for this class of materials with respect to addressing our pressing energy-related concerns are identified.									71	1	0	0	3	1	71			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000642435400041

Infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and elemental analyses revealed that GrO(5000) possesses a high degree of oxygen functionalities including phenolic, carboxylic, and -OSO2H groups, compared with the other fractions. The GrO(5000) was found to be a highly efficient and reusable solid catalyst for the esterification of various carboxylic acids with a variety of alcohols to furnish corresponding esters in high to excellent yields. The catalytic activity of the GrO(5000) was attributed to the ability of highly polar GrO(5000) scaffold to adsorb/attract reactants, where the acid functionalities of GrO(5000) facilitated the esterification process efficiently. The chemical and structural features of GrO(5000) were discussed to understand the improved catalytic activity compared with GrO(2000) and conventional solid acid catalysts.

The as-obtained ph-BN showed a high catalytic activity for the epoxidation of styrene using tert-butyl hydroperoxide as an oxidant. Both experimental and theoretical study demonstrated that the activity originated from the oxygen-containing functional groups at the edges of ph-BN. To further understand the mechanism for this catalytic behavior, in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in a diffusion reflectance model has been used to monitor the evolution of surface functional groups of ph-BN treated at different temperatures (50-800 degrees C). In this way, the active functional groups on the ph-BN have been identified. It was revealed that B-OH groups dehydrate to form BO-B edges and are further oxidized to B-O-O-B type edges. B-OH is the main active site responsible for the epoxidation of styrene, while B-O-O-B edges have a similar activity. Finally, a plausible reaction pathway was proposed for the epoxidation of styrene on this metal-free catalyst based on the density functional theory calculation. A clear understanding of the catalytic sites for this metal-free catalyst and the functional group tuning strategy in this work may expand the BN-based material for various catalytic applications.									8	2	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000674927200044		
J	Garg, Uma; Chang, Philip					Chang, Philip/0000-0002-2137-2837			A Semi-analytic Criterion for the Spontaneous Initiation of Carbon Detonations in White Dwarfs								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				836	2					189	10.3847/1538-4357/aa5d58				FEB 20 2017	2017	Despite over 40 years of active research, the nature of the white dwarf progenitors of SNe Ia remains unclear. However, in the last decade, various progenitor scenarios have highlighted the need for detonations to be the primary mechanism by which these white dwarfs are consumed, but it is unclear how these detonations are triggered. In this paper we study how detonations are spontaneously initiated due to temperature inhomogeneities, e.g., hotspots, in burning nuclear fuel in a simplified physical scenario. Following the earlier work by Zel'Dovich, we describe the physics of detonation initiation in terms of the comparison between the spontaneous wave speed and the Chapman-Jouguet speed. We develop an analytic expression for the spontaneous wave speed and utilize it to determine a semi-analytic criterion for the minimum size of a hotspot with a linear temperature gradient between a peak and base temperature for which detonations in burning carbon-oxygen material can occur. Our results suggest that spontaneous detonations may easily form under a diverse range of conditions, likely allowing a number of progenitor scenarios to initiate detonations that burn up the star.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000395797900005

For two such films as well as an as-deposited film, the average number of exposed surface Pt atoms was estimated from CV to be 1.07(+/-0.05) x 10(15) cm(-2) (real area, as estimated by SEM). These electrodes exhibited high electroactivity for hydrogen adsorption and oxidation of several alcohols, The current density (geometric basis) in the CV for methanol oxidation at a Pt-modified porous film with a pore diameter of 400 nm and a pore depth of 3 mum, was greatly enhanced, by a factor of 16, in comparison to the values obtained with a bulk Pt electrode. This enhancement is attributed to both the high surface area of the nano-honeycomb structure and the high electrocatalytic activity of Pt nanoparticles dispersed inside the pores. The electrocatalytic activities of the Pt-modified nano-honeycomb films were found to be dependent on the structural parameters of the honeycomb pores and the molecular sizes of the alcohols. Interestingly, ac impedance measurements have indicated a decrease in the penetration depths for a Pt-modified porous film with a pore diameter of 60 nm with increasing alcohol size, and an increase in the reaction resistances for ethanol oxidation with decreasing pore diameter.

This paper reports on the reoxidation mechanism of photoreduced polyoxometalates by dioxygen. The overall general reaction, presented generally as M(n+1)- + 1/4O2 + H+ --> M(n-) + 1/2H2O [where M(n-) = P2W18O626- (P2W186-), SiW12O404- (SiW124-), H2W12O406- (H2W126-)], appears to be first order with respect to polyoxometalates and oxygen and zero order with respect to H+ at pH < 1.5 and pH > 3. At the inflection point, the order with respect to H+, is 1.1 +/- 0.4. Rate constants at low pH are 3.8 x 10(-3), 1.0, and > 5.5 s-1 and at high pH are 0.0, 2.7 x 10(-2), and 0.15 s-1 for P2W187-, SiW125-, and H2W127-, respectively (Figure 3). Reoxidation of molybdates is known to be considerably slower; P2Mo18(8-) is not reoxidized by dioxygen, whereas P2Mo1810- reoxidation is from 4 to more than 6 times slower than that of the polyoxotungstates in acid solution. As previously shown with the molybdates, the rates are a function of the degree of reduction; for instance, the rate constants for doubly reduced P2W188- are about 5 times larger than those for the corresponding singly reduced P2W187- anions under identical conditions. The rates parallel the redox potential of the polyoxometalates. Limited work was also done with hydrogen peroxide, which seems to behave differently from dioxygen; the results are compared.									142	6	0	0	16	0	144			0020-1669			WOS:A1992HB09400007

This architecture is genuinely monolithic, with wireless catalyst integration being achieved via compression of metal sputter-coated carbon electrodes against the front and back PV contacts. The resulting MEA-type, sandwich structure minimizes the path length for proton conduction through the membrane ionomer, while simultaneously preventing PV light attenuation by the catalyst layer, a common issue for monolithic PEC structures. Simulated, solar illumination of this construct, when operating in neutral-pH water, yields a peak solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 12.6% during a four-day trial. While the wireless nature of monolithic PEC devices typically prevents the measurement of current flow and faradaic efficiencies, we circumvent this complication through the placement of an electrical shunt between the PV and the cathode catalyst layer, rerouting charge generated at the PV through a potentiostat prior to cathodic proton reduction. Using this configuration, we also show evidence of a corrosion current competing with anodic oxygen evolution under acidic conditions, highlighting the importance of quantifying product generation in monolithic devices.

Herein, a porous graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)/reduction graphene oxide (rGO) structure (CNG) is constructed via a solvothermal approach. By using a facile electrophoretic deposition method, CNG is deposited on nickel (Ni) foam with the formation of highly active CNG-Ni foam photoanode. rGO were utilized to load g-C3N4 , and also acts as the bridge for accelerating the rate of electron transfer from g-C(3)N(4)to Ni foam. The resulted photoanode exhibits an excellent photoelectrochemical performance for synergistic pollutant degradation and H-2 evolution under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm). Such excellent PEC activity is attributed to the strong visible-light absorption and fast electron transmission of the as-obtained photoanode. The visible light-driven photocurrent value of the optimal photoanode can be well maintained up to 24 h, indicating its high stability during the PEC process. This work also shows significance for paving a facile route to fabricating highly active photoelectrodes for environmental and energy applications.									69	6	0	0	15	0	69			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000451023500077

Pt is regarded as the best electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) during water splitting process, however, the scarcity and costliness of Pt restrict the large-scale practical application. On the other hand, transition metal Ni is abundant in earth and exhibits favorable HER catalytic activity theoretically. In this work, we have demonstrated a facile electrospinning combined with calcination and chemical reduction processes to fabricate Pt nanoparticles loaded on nitrogen-doped carbon/Ni nanofibers (Ni-NCNFs-Pt) as efficient HER electrocatalysts. The as-prepared Ni-NCNFs-Pt not only reduced the usage of noble metal Pt but also revealed an excellent electrochemical activity at all values of pH, including the smaller overpotentials of 47, 22 and 84 mV (at j = 10 mA cm(-2)) in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1 M KOH and 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution, respectively. In addition, Ni-NCNFs-Pt nanocatalyst displayed an extraordinary low Tafel slope and long durability over a wide range of pH. The remarkable HER performance could be ascribed to the increased electrochemical active surface area through the introduction of Ni nanoparticles, synergistic interactions between Ni and Pt nanoparticles and the introduction of the conductive nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (NCNFs) substrate which facilitated the fast electron transport. This investigation provides a potential route to construct efficient and low cost HER electrocatalysts with promising practical applications in renewable energy conversion and storage devices.

Differential response of photosynthetic apparatus of cyanobacterium Nostoc muscorum to Pb and Cd toxicity								PHOTOSYNTHETICA				53	2			223	230		10.1007/s11099-015-0096-3				JUN 2015	2015	Nostoc muscorum cells showed metal-induced decrease in the relative growth, pigment contents, O-2 evolution, and Hill activity in response to lead (Pb2+) and cadmium (Cd2+) treatment, which was further accentuated with increase in metal exposure time and metal concentration. I-50 concentrations (50% growth inhibitory concentrations) of Pb2+ and Cd2+ for growth of N. muscorum were 55 and 21 mu g mL(-1), respectively. These results indicated that the cells of N. muscorum were more susceptible to Cd2+ in comparison to Pb2+. The O-2 production was relatively more sensitive to both heavy metals (I-50: 16 and 10 mu g mL(-1) of Pb2+ and Cd2+, respectively) than the Hill activity (I-50: 61 and 39 mu g mL(-1) of Pb2+ and Cd2+, respectively). Further, measurement of Hill activity in the presence of metals and electron donors showed that inhibition sites of both Pb2+ and Cd2+ were located on the oxidizing site of PSII. The chlorophyll a (Chl a) and phycobilisome (PB) fluorescence emission spectra showed that energy transfer from Chl a and PB to PSII reaction center was more susceptible to Cd2+ than Pb2+.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0300-3604	1573-9058		WOS:000354955000009

In this work, we synthesized a novel Co-O cluster based coordination polymer, [Co-2(HL)(2)center dot(DMF)(2)center dot H2O]solvents (Co-CP) by a facile solvothermal method from amino-functionalized ligand and non-precious cobalt salt. The Co-CP possesses a bandgap of 2.65 eV, whose conduction and valence band are -0.8 and 1.85 eV, respectively. Efficiently, the visible-light driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of Co-CP reaches 1778 mu mol g(-1) h (-1), due to the rapid charge transfer and efficient suppression of electron-hole recombination as determined by photocurrent response and photoluminescence measurement. Possible photocatalytic mechanisms are proposed, for which the Co-O clusters are predicted to be the active sites.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1010-6030			WOS:000505274600001

Studies have explored this evolution (so-called OA aging) in the atmosphere, but none have investigated it indoors. Aging organic molecules in both particle and gas-phases undergo changes in oxygen content and volatility, which may ultimately either enhance or reduce the condensed-phase OA concentration (C-OA). This work models OH-induced aging using the two-dimensional volatility basis set (2D-VBS) within an indoor model and explores its significance on C-OA relative to prior modeling methodologies which neglect aging transformations. Lagrangian, time-averaged, and transient indoor simulations were conducted. The time-averaged simulations included a Monte Carlo procedure and sensitivity analysis, using input distributions typical of U.S. residences. Results demonstrate that indoors, aging generally leads to C-OA augmentation. The extent to which this is significant is conditional upon several factors, most notably temperature, OH exposure, and OA mass loading. Time-averaged C-OA was affected minimally in typical residences (<5% increase). However, some plausible cases may cause stronger C-OA enhancements, such as in a sunlit room where photolysis facilitates significant OH production (similar to 20% increase), or during a transient OH-producing cleaning event (similar to 35% peak increase).									13	0	0	0	6	0	13			0905-6947	1600-0668		WOS:000471273100009	30861195

In this work, cobalt selenide catalysts were prepared utilizing both wet chemical route (CoSe and CoSe-DNA) and hydrothermal route (Co0.85Se-hyd). In wet-chemical route, cobalt selenide is prepared with DNA (CoSe-DNA) and without DNA (CoSe). The morphological results in the wet-chemical route had given a clear picture that, with the assistance of DNA, cobalt selenide had formed as nanochains with particle size below 5 nm, while it agglomerated in the absence of DNA. The morphology was nano networks in the hydrothermally assisted synthesis. These catalysts were analyzed for OER activity in 1 M KOH. The overpotentials required at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) were 352, 382, and 383 mV for Co0.85Se-hyd, CoSe, and CoSe-DNA catalysts, respectively. The Tafel slope value was lowest for Co0.85Se-hyd (65 mV/dec) compared to CoSe-DNA (71 mV/dec) and CoSe (80 mV/dec). The chronoamperometry test was studied for 24 h at a potential of 394 mV for Co0.85Se-hyd and was found to be stable with a smaller decrease in activity. From the OER study, it is clear that Co0.85Se was found to be superior to others. This kind of related study can be useful to design the catalyst with increased efficiency by varying the method of preparation.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000469304700034	31070905

Herein, we report a shape-controlled binary photocatalyst consisting of S-doped CeO2 hollow spheres sensitized with ultrathin CdS shells. The core-shelled CeO2-xSx@CdS composite is synthesized using a simple template-assisted method followed by anion-exchange and chemical bath deposition processes. Owing to the reduced band gap caused by the oxygen vacancies in the S-doped CeO2, and the CdS sensitization effect accelerating the interface carrier separation and transfer, the CeO2-xSx@CdS composite exhibits superior photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution (1147.2 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) under visible-light illumination, which is 4.4, 11.1 and 94.8 times higher than that of CdS (258.2 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)), CeO2-xSx (103.0 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) and CeO2 (12.1 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)), respectively. In addition, the composite displays highly efficient organic pollutant degradation (99.8% degradation of RhB within 25 min).									134	16	0	0	16	0	136			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000462662100024

The {Co-16(PO4)(4)} cluster contains a Co4O4 cubane which is structurally analogous to the [Mn3CaO4] core of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) in photosystem II (PSII). Compounds 1-4 were shown to be the first POM-based Co-Pi-cluster molecular catalysts for visible light-driven water oxidation, thus serving as a functional model of the OEC in PSII. The systematic synthesis of four isostructural analogues allowed for investigating the influence of different heteroatoms in the POM ligands on the photocatalytic activities of these Co-Pi cluster WOCs. Further, the POM-based photocatalysts readily recrystallized from the photocatalytic reaction systems with the polyoxoanion structures unchanged, which together with the laser flash photolysis, dynamic light-scattering, P-31 NMR, UV-vis absorption, POM extraction, and ICP-MS analysis results collectively confirmed that compounds 1-4 maintain their structural integrity under the photocatalytic conditions. This study provides not only a valuable molecular model of the "Co-Pi" catalysts with a well-defined structure but also an unprecedented opportunity to fine-tune high-nuclearity POM clusters for visible light-driven water splitting.									375	18	0	0	26	0	378			0002-7863			WOS:000334572200037	24661303

However, the mechanistic impacts of a primitive photosynthetic biosphere on Earth's early atmospheric chemistry and climate are poorly understood. Here, we use a global redox balance model to explore the biogeochemical and climatological effects of different forms of primitive photosynthesis. We find that a hybrid ecosystem of H-2-based and Fe2+-based anoxygenic photoautotrophs-organisms that perform photosynthesis without producing oxygen-gives rise to a strong nonlinear amplification of Earth's methane (CH4) cycle, and would thus have represented a critical component of Earth's early climate system before the advent of oxygenic photosynthesis. Using a Monte Carlo approach, we find that a hybrid photosynthetic biosphere widens the range of geochemical conditions that allow for warm climate states well beyond either of these metabolic processes acting in isolation. Our results imply that the Earth's early climate was governed by a novel and poorly explored set of regulatory feedbacks linking the anoxic biosphere and the coupled H, C and Fe cycles. We suggest that similar processes should be considered when assessing the potential for sustained habitability on Earth-like planets with reducing atmospheres.									28	1	0	0	8	0	28			1752-0894	1752-0908		WOS:000423842000019		
J	Cai, Mei; Ruthkosky, Martin S.; Merzougui, Belabbes; Swathirajan, Swathy; Balogh, Michael P.; Oh, Se H.								Investigation of thermal and electrochemical degradation of fuel cell catalysts								JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES				160	2	SI		977	986		10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.03.033				OCT 6 2006	2006	A significant problem hindering large-scale implementation of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell technology is the loss of performance during extended operation and automotive cycling. Recent investigations of the deterioration of cell performance have revealed that a considerable part of the performance loss is due to the degradation of the electrocatalyst. In this study, an attempt is made to experimentally simulate the degradation processes such as carbon corrosion and platinum (Pt) surface area loss using an accelerated thermal sintering protocol. Two types of Tanaka fuel cell catalyst samples were heat-treated at 250 degrees C in humidified helium (He) gas streams and several oxygen (02) concentrations. The catalysts were then cycled electrochemically in pellet electrodes to determine the hydrogen adsorption (HAD) area and its evolution in subsequent electrochemical cycling. Samples that had undergone different degrees of carbon corrosion and Pt sintering were characterized for changes in carbon mass, active Pt surface area, BET (Brunauer, Emmett and Teller) surface area, and Pt crystallite size. Studies of the effect of oxygen and water concentration on two Tanaka catalysts, dispersed on carbon supports with varying BET areas, revealed that carbon oxidation in the presence of Pt follows two pathways: an oxygen pathway that leads to mass loss due to formation of gaseous products, and a water pathway that results in mass gains, especially for high BET area supports. These processes may be assisted by the formation of highly reactive OH and OOH type radicals. Platinum surface area loss, measured at varying oxygen concentrations and as a function of sintering time using X-ray diffraction (XRD), CO chemisorption, and electrochemical hydrogen adsorption, reveal an important role for carbon corrosion rather than an increase in Pt particle size for the surface area loss. Platinum surface area loss during 10 h of thermal degradation was equivalent to electrochemical degradation observed over 500 cycles for a Tanaka Pt/Vulcan electrode cycled between 0 and 1.2 V (normal hydrogen electrode-NHE). Carbon mass loss observed for 5 h of thermal degradation was comparable to that obtained during a potential hold for 86 h at 1.2 V (NHE) and 95 degrees C for the same catalysts.

Sugarcane bagasse ash is mainly composed of amorphous silica and can be used as a pozzolanic material in concrete. Production of sugarcane bagasse ash (SCBA) based blended cements with different replacement levels of SCBA, and the performance of concrete with these cements in terms of compressive strength, heat of hydration, drying shrinkage and durability are discussed in this paper. Durability performance was investigated by five different methods in this study, namely oxygen permeability test, rapid chloride penetration test, chloride conductivity test, water sorptivity test, DIN water permeability test and Torrent air permeability test. The results from this study show that use of sugarcane bagasse ash in concrete prominently enhances its performance. Low heat of hydration, additional strength gain due to pozzolanic reaction, significant reduction in permeability because of pore refinement and similar drying shrinkage behavior were observed for bagasse ash blended concrete compared to control concrete.

The oxygenated products, benzoic acid (70 %) and benzaldehyde (30 %), were formed after the photoirradiation. The photocatalytic reaction is initiated by intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer from the mesitylene moiety to the singlet excited state of the Acr(+) moiety of Acr(+)-Mes, which affords the electron-transfer state, Acr(aEuro cent)-Mes(aEuro cent+). The Mes(aEuro cent+) moiety can oxidize chloride ion (Cl-) by electron transfer to produce chlorine radical (Cl-aEuro cent), whereas the Acr(aEuro cent) moiety can reduce O-2 to O (2) (aEuro cent a') . The Cl-aEuro cent radical produced abstracts a hydrogen from toluene to afford benzyl radical in competition with the bimolecular radical coupling of Cl-aEuro cent. The benzyl radical reacts with O-2 rapidly to afford the peroxyl radical, leading to the oxygenated product, benzaldehyde. Benzaldehyde is readily further photooxygenated to yield benzoic acid with Acr(aEuro cent)-Mes(aEuro cent+). In the case of an aromatic compound with electron-donating substituents, 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene, photocatalytic chlorination occurred efficiently under the same photoirradiation conditions to yield a monochloro-substituted compound, 2,4,6-trimethoxychlorobenzene.									30	0	0	0	6	0	30			0922-6168	1568-5675		WOS:000312743200018

The influence of tungsten substitution for niobium in the crystal structure of Bi3TiNbO9-based ceramics was studied in detail. The crystal structure analysis revealed that the introduction of W6+ enhanced the octahedral tilt angle along the a axis, which resulted in an optimal piezoelectric property (d(33) = 19.2 pC/N) at x= 0.02. While the structural distortion of BCTNW-100x ceramics became weak with W content further increasing, which made the thermal stability of BCTNW-100x ceramics better. When annealing temperature elevated to 700 degrees C, the d(33 )value of BCTNW-6 ceramic still remained 92% of its initial value, indicating good thermal stability. Furthermore, the dc conduction mechanism of the ceramics was studied. The oxygen vacancies played an important role in dc conduction mechanism at low temperature and the main conduction mechanism at high temperature was intrinsic conduction. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here we reported the high activity of a commercial SiC in a photocatalysis and ozone combined process (photocatalytic ozonation). The commercial SiC showed very weak activity in photocatalysis of oxalic acid (OA) and para-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA) degradation, and its performance in catalytic ozonation was also not satisfied. However, the organics degradation and mineralization rates dramatically increased in the SiC photocatalytic ozonation. The different operation parameters were optimized, and the main reactive radicals in this process and its generation pathways were studied. It was found that photo-generated electron reduction of ozone and oxygen are the main pathways to produce hydroxyl radical, which was responsible to the high oxidizing ability of this process.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000438466000025		
J	Tripathi, Shilpa; Srivastava, J K								Experimental determination of carbon dioxide evolution during aerobic composting of agro-wastes.								Journal of environmental science & engineering				54	4			502	9						2012-Oct	2012	This work aims at optimal composting of agro-wastes like sugarcane bagasse, wood straw and soya husk. A mixture of these substances along with small quantity of food waste as the seed was composted aerobically and carbon dioxide evolved was determined experimentally using a composting system comprising aerobic digester, operating in near-optimal conditions with regard to adequacy of oxygen and temperature in the system. During aerobic composting of agro-waste carbon dioxide is produced due to degradation of different carbon fractions in the substrate. Carbon dioxide production rate, which is a measure of bacterial/fungal activity in composting systems, can be related to various process parameters like different carbon fractions present in the substrate and their reaction rates, progress and termination of compost phenomenon and stabilization of organic matter. This gives a balanced compromise between complexity of mathematical model and extensive experimentation, and can be used for determining optimum conditions for composting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0						MEDLINE:25151714	25151714

The present study is focused on a coastal aquifer, to study the groundwater chemistry, hydrogeochemical characteristics, and salinization processes in a coastal area of the Puri District of Odisha, southeastern coast of India. Groundwater chemistry reveals, water compositions are generally near neutral to slightly alkaline nature in pH, and the total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations varies from 150 mg/l in the inland area to 4006 mg/l towards the shorelines. Piper plot shows four principal hydrochemical water types prevailed in the groundwater zones with water composition changes from fresh water to the saline water mixing. The oxygen isotope (8180) values are found between -5.3 parts per thousand to and -2.96 parts per thousand, which indicates groundwater compositions were influenced by the evaporation process. Based on Cl(-)concentrations (0.4-35 meq/l), the saline end-member is mixing of seawater with the groundwater. Calculations of ionic deltas in groundwater show deficiency of Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42- ions and significantly mixed with seawater and subsequent reactions governed by ion exchange processes in the aquifer. Saturation index shows groundwater were sub saturated to near equilibrium conditions with mineral phases such as dolomite, gypsum, halite and under-saturated with calcite, aragonite and anhydrite. Sulphate depletion observed in groundwater indicates the seawater mixing. Groundwater flow path shows, there is a gradual increasing of TDS concentrations from inland recharge areas to towards the discharge areas of shoreline and groundwater facies changes from Na-K-HCO3 to Na-Mg-Cl type.

Electrolysis was achieved under galvanostatic control as a function of supporting electrolyte and electrode composition. The electrolyses, performed in either the presence or absence of NaCl, were able to promote efficient color removal; moreover, at low chloride concentration (0.01 mol L-1), total color removal was obtained after just 10 min of electrolysis, and a significant increase in total dye combustion was achieved for all the studied anodes in chloride medium (reaching ca. 80% - chemical oxygen demand - COD removal). No significant enhancement in dye color removal or mineralization was observed upon increasing chloride concentration. The influence of oxide composition on dye elimination seems to be significant in both media (with or without chloride), being Ti/Ru0.30Ti0.70O2, the most active material for organic compound oxidation. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was shown to be a limiting reaction in both supporting electrolytes; i.e., NaCl and Na2SO4, and its competition with organic compound oxidation remained an obstacle. The adsorbable organo halogens (AOX) formation study revealed that there is slight consumption of the undesirable species formed within the first minutes of the electrolysis, being Ti/(RuO2)(0.70)(Ta2O5)(0.30) the most environmentally friendly composition. Both anode composition and chloride concentration affect the formation of these undesirable compounds.									26	1	0	0	5	3	26			0103-5053	1678-4790		WOS:000285886500017		
J	Saito, T; Shimoda, M; Tsuyuki, T; Iwama, A								CO2 laser-induced pulsating regression behavior of GAP at sub-atmospheric pressures								COMBUSTION AND FLAME				124	4			611	623		10.1016/S0010-2180(00)00233-9				MAR 2001	2001	Linear pyrolysis of glycidyl azide polymer (GAP) by CO2 laser heating was studied experimentally in argon, nitrogen or oxygen at subatmospheric pressures with laser heat fluxes of 1 to 20 W/cm(2). Surface temperature variations were measured by fine chromel-alumel thermocouples pressed onto the sample surfacer and pulsating regression caused by an abrupt exothermic decomposition was observed. The behavior is very similar to the chuffing phenomenon. The momentary exothermic decomposition reaction was accompanied by the evolution of N-2 resulting mainly from breaking of the azide bond. The surface temperature in one cycle is characterized by three critical temperatures: liquefying (T-1), abrupt thermal decomposition threshold (T-ad), and maximum surface (T-ms) temperatures. Maximum surface temperatures are 700 to 800 K, which are equivalent to the surface temperature observed during self-sustained combustion controlled chiefly by exothermic reaction at the decomposition surface. As the surface heat flux increases, the period of the pulsating regression decreases, being only slightly dependent on the ambient gas. If the period becomes shorter than the characteristic time of GAP, then the pulsating regression will transition into steady regression assisted by laser irradiation. SEM photographs of the quenched surfaces reveal the presence of a liquid layer with a thickness of 7 to 8 mum, about 1/30 of the momentary regression distance. at the GAP surface just before the abrupt thermal decomposition. Spatial temperature profiles at various critical times were established by using two thermocouples embedded inside the GAP sample. Phenomenological modeling is attempted to explain the pulsating phenomena for GAP pyrolysis. From the phenomenological modeling. a subsurface layer with a relatively small temperature gradient is thought to exist at the GAP surface. In view of SEM photographs of quenched surfaces, the surface layer of the whole momentary regression distance Delta1 is thought to change into a liquid layer as soon as the abrupt thermal decomposition starts. One of the causes of nonself-sustained combustion of GAP in inert gases of a few atmospheres would be pulsating decomposition. At 66.7 kPa of oxygen gas the pulsating decomposition very often transitions into sustained combustion.

However, the electrochemical oxidation reaction of molybdenum disulfide nanomaterials in the range of positive potential has not been studied thoroughly. Herein, we have investigated electro-oxidation of molybdenum disulfide nanomaterials and put forward a new reaction mechanism: molybdenum disulfide nanomaterials are electro-oxidized with water to form molybdenum oxysulfide (MoOS2) and hydrogen ions, leading to the release of hydrogen on the counter electrode. Various characterization methods such as contact angle measurement, scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), and gas chromatography (GC) were applied to attest the doping of oxygen and the generation of hydrogen. Based on this reaction, we constructed a novel ultrasensitive electrochemical sensor for detecting trace water with the minimum detectable content of 0.0010% (v/v) in various organic solvents and ionic liquids, which is comparable to the Karl Fischer titration, but with much simpler reagent.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000821777200109	35545868

Under illumination of LED (lambda = 420 nm), the hybrid photoanode exhibits a 7-fold enhancement in photocurrent density relative to bare alpha-Fe2O3 in 0.1 M Na2SO4 at pH 7. Accompanied by the highly stable photocurrent, stoichiometric oxygen and hydrogen are generated with a faraday efficiency over 85% respectively for 4 h photolysis. With hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) serving as the hole scavenger, it demonstrated that integration with molecular catalyst can greatly prompt hole diffusion length of alpha-Fe2O3 and improve its charge transfer properties. Mechanistic study and stability test supports that highly efficient and stable molecular catalyst plays the crucial role in charge separation, which successfully inhibits electron-hole recombination, achieving great enhancement in photocurrent. Therefore, to assemble into a highly active semiconductor-molecule heterojunction for solar fuel generation, the core relies on an available strategy to design the robust, stable and practical catalytic center.

These characteristics give high catalytic performance for oxygen reduction with an onset potential of 0.98 V [ versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)] and a half-wave potential of 0.83 V (versus RHE) in alkaline media, which are comparable with those of the state-of-the-art platinum/carbon catalyst and many noble metal free catalysts. These results demonstrate the significant advantages of the unique mesopore-in-macropore porous structures with efficient heteroatom doping, which provides abundant accessible active sites for high mass and charge transports. The present work provides a new, simple and environmentally safe synthesis strategy for the preparation of 3D porous carbon architectures for use as efficient electrochemical energy devices and gives good insight into the fabrication of advanced nanostructured materials.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2052-1553			WOS:000428186400015

The photocatalysts were characterized using various instrumental methods such as PXRD, UV-Vis DRS, SEM, HR-TEM, XPS, PL and TRPL spectral analysis. Functionalisation by the -HSO3 group and incorporation of AuNPs in the g-C3N4 skeleton lead to the extension of its pi-conjugated system, modification of its semiconductor properties, such as band structure engineering with a tunable bandgap, red-shift of the optical absorption band and promotion of charge migration and separation. The sulfate pre-treated g-C3N4 samples are supposed to have a defected surface due to oxygen vacancies, which increases the adsorption of AuNPs onto the vacant oxygen sites. Thus the AuNPs get adsorbed on the reduced surfaces, increasing the extent and effectiveness of the electronic communication between gold and the g-C3N4 interface. The improved photocatalytic activity could be attributed to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of AuNPs, which synergistically facilitates the photocatalysis process. The photocatalytic activity of Au-sulfated g-C3N4 for photocatalytic splitting of water to produce H-2 was increased 1.5 times compared to that of Au-g-C3N4, 2.5 times compared to that of sulphated-g-C3N4 and 35 times compared to that of single-phase g-C3N4.									104	4	0	0	8	0	107			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000386668200014	27722288	
J	Wang, Chengcheng; Hou, Bingxue; Yuan, Shuxian; Zhang, Qi; Cui, Xumei; Wang, Xintao								Highly active electrocatalysts of iron phthalocyanine by MOFs for oxygen reduction reaction under alkaline solution								RSC ADVANCES				10	45			27014	27023		10.1039/d0ra03468a				JUL 20 2020	2020	Metal-nitrogen-carbon materials (Fe-N/C) have been extensively studied as one of the most excellent electrocatalysts with good catalytic activities and cheap price towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The rational design of metal-organic framework (MOF) derived carbon materials with rapid mass transport ability and good stability is a great challenge to achieve. Herein, intensive research of Fe-N/C catalysts prepared from assembling MOFs with cheap iron phthalocyanine (FePc) for the ORR is innovatively carried out. A series of Fe-N/C nano-architectures are simply synthesized by a convenient assembling method under different temperatures (800 to 1000 degrees C). The assembly method at high temperatures tunes the number of FeN(x)active sites and intensifies the exposure of interior active sites. The highly dispersing Fe20-N/C electrocatalyst treated at 900 degrees C exhibits remarkable stability and excellent ORR activities with a half-wave potential of 0.866 V (vs.RHE) in alkaline solution, which is higher than that of commercial Pt/C (0.838 Vvs.RHE) under the same test conditions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results illustrate that incorporated MOFs interact with the active centre of FePc, tend to enhance the electron transition and to promote the kinetics of the ORR. Overall, highly dispersed Fe-N/C MOF-based materials are excellent non-precious metal electrocatalysts for energy and environmental applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2046-2069		WOS:000555612200045	35515754	
J	Bourane, A; Bianchi, D								Oxidation of CO on a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst: From the surface elementary steps to light-off tests I. Kinetic study of the oxidation of the linear CO species								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				202	1			34	44		10.1006/jcat.2001.3242				AUG 15 2001	2001	The adsorption of CO (1% CO/He mixture) at 300 K on a 2.9% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst leads to the detection of a strong IR band at 2075 cm(-1) associated with a weak and broad IR band at approximate to 1850 cm(-1) ascribed to linear (denoted by L) and multibound (Bridged and 3-fold coordinated) CO species, respectively. Due to a high heat of adsorption, the L species does not desorb in helium at a temperature lower than 350 K. This allows us to study the rate of oxidation of the L species using several x% O-2/He mixtures (x in the range 0.5-100) and at five reaction temperatures (range 298-350 K). It is shown that the L species is oxidized into CO2 according to the elementary step (denoted by S3): L + O-ads --> CO2 (rate constant k(3)) involving a dissociatively adsorbed oxygen species. The change in the rate of disappearance of the L species (determined by the evolution of its coverage theta (L)) with the O-2 partial pressure (P-O2) indicates that the reaction proceeds (a) without any competition between L and O-ads species; and (b) with an apparent rate constant k(a) which varies linearly with P-O2(0.5). This indicates that O-ads is weakly adsorbed with a coverage (denoted by theta (0)) given by Langmuir's model for dissociative chemisorption: theta (0) = (KO2PO2)(0.5) with (KO2PO2)(0.5) much less than 1. The apparent rate constant of step S3 determined at several reaction temperatures leads to an apparent activation energy E-a = E-3- (E-O2/2) = 65 +/- 3 kJ/mol (where E-3 is the activation energy of step, S3 and E-O2 is the heat of adsorption of oxygen). It is shown that the preexponential factor of the apparent rate constant is in agreement with the value expected from the statistical thermodynamics considering immobile adsorbed species. Moreover, when one considers that the oxygen is weakly adsorbed even with P-O2 = 10(5) Pa, it is shown that E-O2. must be < approximate to 30 kJ/mol, leading to an activation energy E-3 in the range 65-80 kJ/mol. The rate of oxidation of the L species characterized by step S3 allows us to interpret in following studies the data (coverage of the L species and CO conversion) recorded during the light-off tests using several 1% CO/x% O-2/He mixtures with x in the range 0.125-50.

The so-constructed hierarchical CoFe2O4/hNCNC catalyst exhibits a high oxygen reduction activity with an onset potential of 0.966 V and half-wave potential of 0.819 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, far superior to the corresponding 0.846 and 0.742 V for its counterpart of CoFe2O4/hCNC with undoped hierarchical carbon nanocages (hCNC) as the support, which locates at the top level for spinel-based catalysts to date. Consequently, the CoFe2O4/hNCNC displays the superior performance to the CoFe2O4/hCNC, when used as the cathode catalysts in the home-made Al-air batteries. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations reveal the more charge transfer from CoFe2O4 to hNCNC than to hCNC, indicating the stronger interaction between CoFe2O4 and hNCNC due to the nitrogen participation. The enhanced interaction and hierarchical morphology favor the high dispersion and modification of electronic states for the active species as well as the mass transport during the oxygen reduction process, which plays a significant role in boosting the electrocatalytic performances. In addition, we noticed the high sensitivity of O 1s spectrum to the particle size and chemical environment for spinel oxides, which is used as an indicator to understand the evolution of ORR activities for all the CoFe2O4-related contrast catalysts. Accordingly, the well-defined structure-performance relationship is demonstrated by the combination of experimental characterizations with theoretical calculations. This study provides a promising strategy to develop efficient, inexpensive and durable oxygen reduction electrocatalysts by tuning the interaction between spinel metal oxides and the carbon-based supports.

This work examines nanostructure degradation of composite LSM/YSZ cathodes induced by electrochemical operation in humidified air. Three commercial button cells operated in humidified air for various durations at 800 degrees C exhibited more severe performance degradation than the cell operated in dry air. Microscopy imaging reveals nanostructure degradation within the cathode active layer, especially in the regions nearest to the electrolyte. Newly formed Mn-enriched nano-precipitates accompanied by nano-voids initiate at the original TPBs and propagate along the LSM/YSZ interface. The abundance of the nanoprecipitates at LSM/YSZ interfaces increases with operation time, and prolonged operation in humidified air further promotes the formation of the Mn-enriched precipitates along YSZ/YSZ grain boundaries. The formation mechanism of those precipitates and their influence on the cathode performance are discussed.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000490030800061

Substantial transient changes to the electronic structure, which persist after the duration of the pulse, are mainly observed for in-plane polarized electric fields, corresponding to a laser pulse arriving perpendicular to the interface. While the strongest charge redistribution takes place in the Fe layer, a time-dependent change in the occupation numbers is visible in all layers, mediated by the presence of interface states. The time evolution of the layer-resolved time-dependent occupation numbers indicates a strong orbital dependence with the depletion from in-plane orbitals (e.g., d(x2-y2) of Fe) and accumulation in out-of-plane orbitals (d(3z2-r2) of Fe and p(z) of apical oxygen). We also observe a small net charge transfer of less than one percent of an electron away from oxygen towards the Mg sites, even for MgO layers which are not directly in contact with the metallic Fe.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2469-9950	2469-9969		WOS:000466609700002

Here, an effective water oxidation catalyst of hierarchical FeTiO3-TiO2 hollow spheres are prepared via a two-step sequential solvothermal processes and followed by thermal treatment. The existence of an effective heterointerface and built-in electric field in the surface space charge region in FeTiO3-TiO2 hollow spheres plays a positive role in promoting the separation of photoinduced electron-hole pairs. Surface photovoltage, transient-state photovoltage, fluorescence and electrochemical characterization are used to investigate the transfer process of photo-induced charge carriers. The photogenerated charge carriers in the hierarchical FeTiO3-TiO2 hollow spheres with a proper molar ratio display much higher separation efficiency and longer lifetime than those in the FeTiO3 alone. Moreover, it is suggested that the hierarchical porous hollow structure can contribute to the enhancement of light utilization, surface active sites and material transportation through the framework walls. This specific synergy significantly contributes to the remarkable improvement of the photocatalytic water oxidation activity of the hierarchical FeTiO3-TiO2 hollow spheres under simulated sunlight (AM1.5).									41	3	0	0	5	0	43			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000361834100045	26365495

Moreover, a recent re-evaluation of habitat limitations has been suggested after characterization of deep-sea corals in the Red Sea, where they live at temperatures of above 20 degrees C at low oxygen concentrations. To gain further insight into the biology of deep-sea corals, we produced reference transcriptomes and studied gene expression of three deep-sea coral species from the Red Sea, i.e. Dendrophyllia sp., Eguchipsammia fistula, and Rhizotrochus typus. Our analyses suggest that deep-sea coral employ mitochondrial hypometabolism and anaerobic glycolysis to manage low oxygen conditions present in the Red Sea. Notably, we found expression of genes related to surface cilia motion that presumably enhance small particle transport rates in the oligotrophic deep-sea environment. This is the first study to characterize transcriptomes and in situ gene expression for deep-sea corals. Our work offers several mechanisms by which deep-sea corals might cope with the distinct environmental conditions present in the Red Sea As such, our data provide direction for future research and further insight to organismal response of deep-sea coral to environmental change and ocean warming.									14	0	0	0	14	0	14			2045-2322			WOS:000406281400007	28743941

However, molten salt-involved preparation of CTFs at 400-600 degrees C causes debate on whether CTFs represent organic frameworks or carbon. Herein, new CTFs based on the 1,3-dicyanoazulene monomer (CTF-Azs) are synthesized using molten ZnCl2 at 400-600 degrees C. Chemical structure analysis reveals that the CTF-Az prepared at low temperature (400 degrees C) exhibits polymeric features, whereas those prepared at high temperatures (600 degrees C) exhibit typical carbon features. Even after being treated at even higher temperatures, the CTF-Azs retain their rich porosity, but the polymeric features vanish. Although structural de-conformation is a widely accepted outcome in polymer-to-carbon rearrangement processes, the study evaluates such processes in the context of CTF systems. A proof-of-concept study is performed, observing that the as-synthesized CTF-Azs exhibit promising performance as cathodes for Li- and K-ion batteries. Moreover, the as-prepared NPCs exhibit excellent catalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance; hence, they can be used as air cathodes in Zn-air batteries. This study not only provides new building blocks for novel CTFs with controllable polymer/carbon features but also offers insights into the formation and structure transformation history of CTFs during thermal treatment.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1022-1336	1521-3927		WOS:000815016500001	35678742

The conversion efficiencies of aniline over the samples are revealed as follow order: BaO/TiO2 > SrO/TiO2 > CaO/TiO2 > MgO/TiO2. The combined results of XPS and CO2 TPD indicate that the electron density of lattice oxygen and the surface basicity for the photocatalysts became higher and higher with the atomic number increase of the alkaline metal elements, in accordance with the order of the conversion efficiency. The sample SrO/TiO2 shows the highest nitrosobenzene selectivity. BaO/TiO2 with highest surface basicity may facilitate the further aniline transformation to nitrobenzene and azobenzene, resulting in lower selectivity for nitrosobenzene. Surface complexes formed on the basic sites of the catalysts via aniline chemsorption would be acted as active sites and be excited for the photocatalytic oxidation of aniline under visible light irradiation.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000475744800038

The efficient and optimum use of noble metal Pt as a cocatalyst is of great significance. In this work, we demonstrated a rapid and facile sonochemical approach to the deposition of Pt on CdS nanorods with H2PtCl6 as a precursor in an aqueous solution of methanol, which was achieved by the ultrasonic irradiation in an ultrasonic cleaning bath. The resulting Pt-deposited CdS (Pt/CdS) exhibits remarkably high efficiency for hydrogen evolution from water splitting, with a highest H-2 evolution rate of 24.15 mmol h(-1) g(-1) over 0.5 wt% Pt/CdS. Various characterizations revealed that the ultrasonic irradiation can effectively drive the completion reduction of Pt4+ in the precursor (H2PtCl6), and the tight adherence of the resulting ultrafine metallic Pt nanoparticles with an average size of 1.75 nm to the surface of CdS nanorods, both of which would contribute to the enhanced photocatalytic H-2 evolution. This work, we believe, offers a simple but effective approach to the deposition of noble metal Pt as an efficient cocatalyst on CdS for high photocatalytic H-2 evolution.									27	2	0	0	2	0	27			2398-4902			WOS:000467219500014		
J	Wang Hao; Jin Bao-sheng; Wang Xiao-jia; Yu Bo; Cao Jun; Lu Dong-qiang								Research of Texture Structure for Coke Layer in Ascension Pipe of Coke Oven Based on SEM and XPS								SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS				39	11			3333	3339		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2019)11-3333-07				NOV 2019	2019	In this work, the coke layer on the surface of ascension pipe is investigated, and scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) are applied to research microscopic appearance, elemental composition and bonding state of different coke layers, and further analyze texture formation and evolution law of the coke layer. SEM analysis displays that: coke layer on the surface of ascension pipe presents different microscopic appearance, 1(#) coke layer presents porous structure with 0.1 similar to 1.0 mu m carbon particle loosely stacked; 2(#) and 3(#) coke layer show enhanced compactness with 1.0 similar to 3.0 mu m carbon particle stacked; 4(#) coke layer displays lots of compact patterned structure. The phenomenon indicates the formation process of the coke layer as follows: the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons react to form primary coke layer with particle size of 0.1 similar to 1.0 mu m; primary coke layer react with each other to form compact intermediate coke layer with particle size of 1.0 similar to 3.0 mu m in catalysis of metal element (Fe, et al) of dust in raw gas; intermediate coke layer further to form ultimate layer at high temperature. XPS analysis displays that, 1(#)-4(#) coke layer present C element content of 91.78%, 91.95%, 92.74% and 94.01%, O element content of 5.58%, 5.42%, 4.39% and 2.86%, corresponding to the C/O ratio of 16.45, 16.96, 21.12 and 32.87, indicating at the same time of structure change for the coke layers, oxygen-containing groups in coke layer conduct removal reaction under the condition of metal element (Fe, et al) of dust in raw gas, resulting the macroscopic increase of C/O ratio. Furthermore, peak fitting for bonding state of C element shows that 1(#)-4(#) coke layer present C-C/C-H structure content of 80.42%, 78.00%, 75.50% and 81.29%, C-O/C-N structure content of 10.22%, 11.93%, 13.54% and 9.35%, C=O/O=N structure content of 9.36%, 10.07%, 10.96% and 9.36%. Peak fitting for bonding state of O element shows that 1(#)-4(#) coke layer present =O structure content of 20.40%, 22.21% 19.93%, 18.36%, corresponding to -O- structure content of 24.60%, 27.80%, 31.35%, 37.82% with O-2/H2O structure content of 55.00%, 49.99%, 48.72% and 43.82%. The above phenomenon indicates that the following chemical process are conducted on the coke layer: the porous structure of primary coke layer absorbs oxygen gas (O-2) and water molecule (H2O), which oxidizes coke layer at high temperature. The oxidation reaction and removal reaction result in significant change of microscopic bonding state of O element in coke layer, decreasing content of O-2/H2O and =O structure and increasing -O- structure. The above research reveals texture formation and evolution mechanism of coke layer on the surface of ascension pipe, providing experimental and theoretical basis for solving coke problem of ascension pipe, enhancing heat exchange efficiency and decreasing energy consumption of coking enterprises.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1000-0593			WOS:000503107900003

The charge density analysis revealed two active sites of the catalyst toward ORR: the MN4 site and the C=C bond of the N-C=C-N metal-chelating fragment (C-2 site). The structure of O-containing adsorbates (O-2*, HOO*, O*, HO*, etc.) on the two sites and the corresponding adsorption energies were determined. The analysis of the free energy diagrams allows to conclude that the 4e(-) mechanism of ORR is thermodynamically preferable for all the studied catalysts. The probability of the 2e(-) mechanism of ORR with the formation of hydrogen peroxide decreases in the order Cu > Ag > Zn. The most and the least exergonic steps of the conventional 4e(-) mechanism of ORR on each active site of model catalysts as well as the electrode potentials of deceleration and of maximum catalytic activity in both acidic and alkaline media are determined. The relative catalytic activity toward ORR increases in the order Zn < Ag << Cu and is mainly attributed to the C-2 site rather than the MN4 site, while combined catalytic activity of the two sites (AgN4/C-2 sites) is predicted for the AgN4-CNT catalyst.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2470-1343			WOS:000610993300036	33458489

Aiming at enamine-based photoredox catalysis for atom-economic and metal-free sp(3 )C-H activation, an amide-based two-dimensional (2D) porous organic framework (POF) is devised. The pendent -NH2 groups are judiciously anchored with two catalytic stations viz. Rose Bengal and L-proline, through stepwise variation of solid phase peptide synthesis. The dual-catalyst engineered POF represents a fully organic material that synergistically performs visible-light triggered oxidative Mannich reaction to produce biorelevant heterocycle beta-amino ketone in excellent yield at room temperature, using oxygen as clean and selective oxidant. Importantly, activity of this bi-functionalized catalyst compares favorably well to individual homogeneous counterparts. The covalently modified framework demonstrates economic viability via gram-scale synthesis besides admirable reusability, and proves to be effective for nineteen varieties of substrates. The photocatalytic path is detailed from efficient energy transfer from host polymer to substrate in light of experimental and theoretical studies, which provides proof-of-concept to the photo-organo combined mechanism. The material benefits heterogenising two homogeneous catalysts, besides excluding additional steps of conventional Mannich reactions, and offers a step-forward to smart and green cross-dehydrogenative coupling reactions.

Their electrochemical catalytic performances are evaluated by methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). TEM, EDS, XRD and XPS measurements are used to characterize their microstructures and compositions. Results suggest that PtFe-PtxFeyCezOj nanohybrids have overall sizes around 2 nm, showing gradient structures composed of PtFe rich inner parts and cerium oxide rich outer layers. They preserve angular shapes and rough surfaces, whose atoms have metallic states and/or multi-oxidation states. The electrochemical catalytic measurements indicate that PtFe-Pt(xF)e(y)CezO(j) nanohybrids exhibit excellent electrochemical catalytic performances in MOR, ORR and HER. Particularly, the PtFe-PtxFeyCezOj nanohybrids with the designed atom ratio of Fe: Pt: Ce = 1: 1: 1 show the best MOR performance, with a forward peak current of 1018.6 mA/mgPt, which is 5.6-fold enhancement compared to the commercial Pt/C catalysts (180.8 mA/mgPt), and the best ORR performance, with a specific activity of 3.28mA/cm(2) and mass activity of 0.73 A/mgPt, which are 6.0- and 4.6-fold enhancement compared with the commercial Pt/C catalysts (0.55 mA/cm(2) and 0.16 A/mgPt). It also gives HER a much low Tafel slope (19mV dec(-1)) comparing with those previously reported. Chronoamperometry tests suggest that PtFeCe1 catalysts can maintain 2-fold activity of commercial Pt/C catalysts at the end of 4000 s' operation. TEM images of nanohybrids before and after electrochemical catalytic tests confirm that the suitable coating of CeOx prevents the PtFe nanohybrids from intensive etching and dissolving in the strong acidic reaction electrolytes and improves the durability and microstructure stability of these nanohybrids. The greatly improved catalytic performances are fundamentally resulted not only from the synergistic interface effect between the PtFe alloy rich inner parts and the cerium oxide rich outer layers, but also from the electron orbital hybridization effects among Pt, Fe and Ce atoms. This study provides a new methodology in the microstructure design and controlled synthesis of efficient multifunctional nanocatalysts with stable microstructures by hybridizing rare-earth metal oxides to form stable thin outer-layers. These stable nanocatalysts shall preserve valuable applications in fuel cells and hydrogen production by water splitting. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The oxidation rates under the various experimental conditions were determined by in-situ thermogravimetry. In dry oxygen a protective scale growth occurs with an oxidation rate controlled by diffusion in the scale. In presence of water vapor, after an incubation period, the scales become non-protective, as a result of a change of the oxidation limiting process. The water vapor effect is especially apparent in the temperature range of 600-700 degrees C, whereas at higher temperatures hardly any effect was found. The destruction of the protective scale by water vapor does not only depend on the H(2)O content but also on the H(2)O/O(2)-ratio.					9th Conference in Solid State Analysis9th Conference in Solid State Analysis	JUN 23-26, 1997JUN 23-26, 1997	German Natl Sci Fdn; Saxony State Dept Sci & Art; Fund Chem Ind; German Chem Soc, Div Anal Chem; Tech Univ Chemnitz, Inst ChemGerman Natl Sci Fdn; Saxony State Dept Sci & Art; Fund Chem Ind; German Chem Soc, Div Anal Chem; Tech Univ Chemnitz, Inst Chem	CHEMNITZ, GERMANYCHEMNITZ, GERMANY	57	4	0	0	0	0	61			0937-0633			WOS:000075606100006

The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) assembled by the LaFeO2.965-delta Cl0.035 cathode delivers an attractive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.4% with a remarkable PCE enhancement factor of 23% compared with Pt, which is higher than most of the reported non-Pt DSSC cathodes. Attractively, LaFeO2.965-delta Cl0.035 displays superior IRR activity/stability and structural stability in the I-3(-)/I--based electrolyte compared to pristine LaFeO3 because chlorine doping facilitates the creation of oxygen vacancies (active sites) and enhances surface acidity simultaneously. This study provides a new way for designing outstanding IRR electrocatalysts, which could be applied to many redox couple-mediated photo/electrochemical devices.									13	2	0	0	0	0	13			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000489001900014	31532199

The defective and robust NiO layer can not only ensure the first capture of Fe atoms through fast impregnation, but also prevent structural collapse and maintain large Fe adsorption layers. In addition, Fe is found to promote the reconstruction process, leading to more defects to facilitate the second capture. Moreover, the reconfiguration can be controlled by adjusting the ratio of Fe and Ni, obtaining appropriate and uniform dynamically stable Fe sites followed by the third trapping. This triple capture can maintain the dynamic balance of the dissolution and redeposition of active species. Thus, an elevated catalytic performance can be expected with an overpotential of 275 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) and favorable durability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2052-1553			WOS:000755944300001

In contrast, certain vertebrate species including fish and amphibians, as well as neonatal mammals, are capable of complete cardiac regeneration after various types of myocardial injury such as resection of the ventricular apex or myocardial infarction, with this regeneration being mediated by the proliferation of cardiomyocytes, dissolution of temporary fibrosis, and revascularization of damaged tissue. In an effort to identify regulators of cardiac regeneration and to develop novel therapeutic strategies for induction of myocardial regeneration in the adult human heart, recent studies have adopted an approach based on comparative biology. These studies have pointed to cellular or tissue responses to environmental cues-including activation of the immune system, the reaction to mechanical stress, and the adoption of oxidative metabolism-as key determinants of whether the heart undergoes regeneration or nonregenerative scar formation after injury. We here summarize recent insight into the molecular mechanisms as well as environmental and systemic factors underlying cardiac regeneration based on the findings of inter- or intraspecific comparisons between regenerative and nonregenerative responses to heart injury. We also discuss how recent progress in understanding the molecular, systemic, and environmental basis of cardiac regeneration in a variety of organisms may relate to multiple scientific fields including ecology, evolutionary as well as developmental biology.									7	0	0	0	6	0	7			0167-4889	1879-2596		WOS:000515431200001	31837984

The photodegradation of the composite films was compared with that of pure PVC films through performing weight loss monitoring, scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), FT-IR and UV-VIS spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). TiO2-embedded PVC showed highly enhanced photodegradation. Irradiating the composite film for 300 h under air reduced its average molecular weight by two-thirds and weight by 27% while the irradiation under nitrogen atmosphere induced little degradation. The photocatalytic degradation of the composite film accompanied the increase in the FT-IR carbonyl peak intensity, the evolution of CO2 and H2O, and the whitening due to the visible light scattering from growing cavities. XPS analysis of the composite film showed that the surface concentration of oxygen increased while that of chlorine decreased with irradiation. The SEM images of the irradiated composite films showed the development of cavities around the imbedded TiO2 particles and implied that active oxygen species which were photogenerated on TiO2 surface desorb and diffuse across a few micrometers to react with the polymer matrix.

The film microstructure and optical properties are then characterized by x-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy, and spectrophotometry, respectively. The results indicate that no clear Ag diffraction peak is discernable in the Ag2O film annealed below 200 degrees C. In comparison, the Ag2O film annealed at 200 degrees C begins to exhibit characteristic Ag diffraction peaks, and in particular the Ag2O film annealed at 250 degrees C can demonstrate enhanced Ag diffraction peaks. This implies that the threshold of the thermal decomposition reaction to produce Ag particles is approximately 200 degrees C for the Ag2O film. In addition, an evolution of the film surface morphology from compact and pyramid-like to a rough and porous structure clearly occurred with increasing annealing temperature. The porous structure might be attributable to the escape of the oxygen produced during annealing, while the rough surface might originate from the reconstruction of the surface. The dispersion of interference peak intensity in the reflectance and transmission spectra could be attributed to the Ag particles produced. The lowered crystallinity and Ag particles produced induce a lattice defect, which results in an enhanced transmissivity in the violet region and a weakened transmissivity in the infrared region.									11	8	0	0	0	0	13			0256-307X			WOS:000274360800066

The synthesized nanocomposite was characterized by SEM, XRD, EDX, UV-vis spectroscopy, N-2 adsorption/desorption, photocurrent response, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The superior contact between WO3 and RGO sheets in the nanocomposite facilitates the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue and evolution of oxygen. The cause of the enhanced photocatalytic performance could ascribe to the highly facilitated electron transport by the synergistic effect between WO3 and RGO sheets, as well as suppressing the electron hole pair recombination in the nanocomposite.

There are among them: granular and agranular amoebocytes, morula cells, vibratile and lymphocyte-like cells. All these cells take part in cellular response to immune challenges through phagocytosis, clotting, encapsulation of foreign particles, cytotoxicity, and the production of antimicrobial agents, such as reactive oxygen and nitric oxide. The data are given on a variety of humoral factors found in the coelomic fluid, including different types of lectines, agglutinins, hemolysins, acute phase proteins and antimicrobial factors. The discussion on cooperation between cellular and humoral arms of defense reactions during inflammation reveals the crucial role of coelomocytes in immune response. It is suggested that the sea urchin complement system (that is homologous to the alternative pathway in vertebrates) is appeared initially in echinoderms as a protein cascade that points to opsonization of foreign cells and particles, augmenting their phagocytosis and subsequent destruction by coelomocytes. So the identification of a simple complement system as a part of the echinoderm immune response shows that these animals as well as all invertebrate deuterostomes share innate immune system homologies with vertebrates. Studying the simpler immune response demonstrated by echinoderms is important for understanding the ancestral deuterostome defense system and reconstructing the evolution of immune system in higher vertebrates.									9	10	2	0	9	1	22			0044-4596			WOS:000222568400003	15329012	
J	KOCKS, P; ROSS, J; BJORKMAN, O								THERMODYNAMIC EFFICIENCY AND RESONANCE OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN A C-3 PLANT								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY				99	44			16483	16489		10.1021/j100044a043				NOV 2 1995	1995	Experiments are presented on the effects of external periodic variation of CO2 concentration on the dissipation and thermodynamic efficiency of photochemistry in whole leaves which have damped oscillations in photochemical activity. The results confirm, in an in vivo system, the possibility of variable efficiency and variable dissipation of chemical reactions, far from equilibrium, obtained by means of external periodic variation of constraints. Leaves of the C-3 species, Arbutus menziesii Pursh., were placed in an atmosphere of supersaturating CO2 concentration (5.0%) and illuminated for a given period with strong actinic light to elicit damped oscillations in the rate of photochemistry. The external concentration of CO2 was then varied between that of normal air and 5.0%. We measured changes in the steady state fluorescence (F') and the maximum fluorescence during illumination for 1.3 s with saturating light (F'(m)). The experiment was repeated for seven periods and two different phases of CO2 perturbations. From F'(m), and F' we calculate the changes in Stern-Volmer quenching of the maximum variable fluorescence (SVN) and the quantum yield of photochemistry (phi(PC)). SVN is a measure of the absorbed excitation energy dissipated as heat, and phi(PC) is a measure of the efficiency of photon utilization by photosystem II. When the phase of the perturbation in CO2 concentration is out-of-phase with the onset of illumination, an increase in the average phi(PC) is observed relative to a perturbation of the same period, but in-phase. In addition, for some periods of perturbation, the average SVN for out-of-phase perturbations decreases relative to in-phase perturbations, while at other periods there is no difference between the in- and out-of-phase perturbations. A resonance response in SVN is observed that has a relationship to the phase and period of the perturbation. These results show that the average dissipation and thermodynamic efficiency of photochemistry depend not only on the mean external concentration of CO2 but also oh the phase and period of the external changes in CO2 concentration. We report an unexpected discrepancy between the results of an oxygen evolution measurement and the photochemical yield, phi(PC), obtained from fluorescence measurements in 2.5% and 5.0% CO2. In a companion paper, we present the formulation of a kinetic model for the (damped) oscillations based on ion-gated channels.									5	0	0	0	3	0	6			0022-3654			WOS:A1995TD47800043

In the present study, we determined two novel CuZnSOD genes (designated as CeCSD1 and CeCSD2) from the toxicity-testing freshwater algae Closterium ehrenbergii and examined their structural features, phylogenetic relationships, and gene expression under exposure to different metals. Putative CeCSD1 (204 aa, 20.6 kDa) and CeCSD2 (155 aa, 15.3 kDa) proteins had conserved CuZnSOD family motifs and metal (Cu, Zn) binding sites, but different N-terminus structures, that is, CeCSD1 has a signal peptide to chloroplasts. Phylogenetic analysis of each protein revealed that C. ehrenbergii was well clustered with other green algae and plants. Real-time PCR results showed that the gene expression obviously increased with heavy metal exposure. In addition, excess copper considerably increased the SOD activity and ROS generation but decreased the photosynthetic efficiency in treated cells. These results suggest that CeCSDs are involved in the antioxidant defense system and can be regarded as potential biomarkers for monitoring metal contaminants in aquatic environments.									6	0	0	0	7	0	7			1520-4081	1522-7278		WOS:000483554600001	31452338

The introduction of insulators in these materials was motivated by the need to improve the stability of many inherently unstable semiconductors with desirable optical properties. Recently, it has been demonstrated that insulators, in addition to improving the stability, can also improve performance. Specifically, it was shown that the generated photovoltage of some MIS systems is highly affected by optimizing insulator thickness. In this study, we quantify the extent to which insulator tuning can be used to optimize photovoltage. This is shown experimentally by comparing the performance of two systems with inherently different barrier heights but, otherwise, identical optical and electrocatalytic properties for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). These photocathodes contained a p-type Si light absorber, an HfO2 insulator, and a layered Ti-Pt or Al-Pt electrocatalyst. A comprehensive model was developed to illuminate the underlying processes governing performance and guide the design of MIS systems.									13	1	0	0	1	0	13			2380-8195			WOS:000496040800009

Here, we report observations of strong structural oscillations of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) in the presence of both H2O vapour and electron irradiation using environmental transmission electron microscopy. These oscillations are related to the formation and collapse of gaseous bubbles. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy provides direct evidence of O-2 formation in these bubbles due to the incorporation of H2O into BSCF. SrCoO3-delta was found to exhibit small oscillations, while none were observed for La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta and LaCoO3. The structural oscillations of BSCF can be attributed to the fact that its oxygen 2p-band centre is close to the Fermi level, which leads to a low energy penalty for oxygen vacancy formation, high ion mobility, and high water uptake. This work provides surprising insights into the interaction between water and oxides under electron-beam irradiation.									111	2	0	0	9	0	112			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000391343300022	27698352

The protonation state is determined by the redox state S-i and the protein microenvironment. A mechanism is proposed for water oxidation in the WOC that is based on three key postulates: (1) water oxidation takes place in the first coordination sphere of one manganese dimer [MnaMnb]; (2) the essential O-O bond is preformed in S-3 as part of a rapid redox isomerism S-3(I) <-> S-3(II) where in S-3(II) a nuclear geometry and electronic configuration is attained that corresponds to a peroxidic-type species; and (3) S-3(II) is an 'entatic state' for the formation of complexed dioxygen triggered by Y-Z(OX) induced electron abstraction from the WOC and electronic redistribution to S-0(O-2).									82	6	1	0	53	0	87			0031-9317			WOS:A1997XU26000009

It is a two-electrode electrochemical cell based on the nickel-copper-phosphide film as a biofunctional catalyst. The overpotentials for HER and OER are significantly reduced by the Cu incorporation to the nickel-phosphide, ascribed to the low charge transfer resistance. The long-term stability at high voltage (> 10 V) is also obtained by introducing an oxygen-rich layer in the near-surface region of the film in the OER electrode. The devices are proven to remove water (pH 7.0) with a rate of approximately 0.6 ml/h at 10 V, reducing the water content in the air. A flexible cell with transparency over 90% is also fabricated and the water removal capability is found to maintain over 75% at a curvature of 0.18/cm.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000471201800035

The methods were applied at a site contaminated by tetrachlorethylene (PCE) and trichlorethylene (TCE), with total concentrations from 10 to 50 mg/l. Concentrations of chlorinated ethenes, inorganic components of interest, pH and oxidation reduction potential (ORP) were monitored at the site for a period up to 650 days. The method of biological reductive dechlorination supported by lactate showed a considerable removal of PCE and TCE, but temporary accumulation of transient reaction product 1,2-cis-dihloroethene. Reductive dechlorination with nZVI showed a significant reduction in the concentration of chlorinated ethenes without a formation of intermediate products. The development of pH showed only small changes due to the high buffering capacity of the aquifer. Both methods differ in the initial development of ORP, but over the long term showed similar values around 100 mV. Significant differences were observed for chemical oxygen demand, where groundwater after the application of nZVI showed no change in comparison to the application of lactate. The reductive effects of both agents were verified by changes in inorganic compound concentrations.									9	0	0	0	9	0	9			0959-3330	1479-487X		WOS:000303581300002	22720397

Here we describe new findings on the amorphous platinum-nickel-phosphorous nanoparticles supported on carbon black (PtNiPa/C) and the comparison between their catalytic activity and that of the nanoscale crystalline and phase-segregated PtNiP nanoparticles. The nanoscale amorphous, crystalline and phase-segregated catalysts were probed as a function of surface composition, particle size, and thermal treatment conditions using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, selected area electron diffraction and electrochemical characterization. The results provide the experimental evidence in support of nanoscale amorphous, crystalline, and phase-segregated PtNiP nanoparticles evolution dependence on the catalyst synthesis temperature. More importantly, the results of the electrochemical performance investigation showed that the amorphous structure has not only better catalytic activity for methanol oxidation but also stronger tolerance to carbon monoxide poisoning compared to the crystalline and phase-segregated structure. Besides, the thermal control of the formation of nanoscale amorphous, crystalline and phase-segregated structured catalysts provided the opportunity for establishing the correlation between the nanoscale phase structures of the catalysts and their electrocatalytic activity in methanol oxidation reaction, which plays an important role in developing highly active electrocatalysts for direct methanol fuel cells.									53	3	0	0	1	0	54			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000330779700028	24414092

However, achieving such an atomically thin multi-metallene still presents a great challenge. Herein, we present a new synthetic method for an atomic-level palladium-iridium (PdIr) bimetallene with an average thickness of only similar to 1.0 nm for achieving superior catalysis in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR). The curved PdIr bimetallene presents a top-ranked high electrochemical active area of 127.5 +/- 10.8 m(2) g(Pd+Ir)(-1) in the reported noble alloy materials, and exhibits a very low overpotential, ultrahigh activity and improved stability for HER and FAOR. DFT calculation reveals that the PdIr bimetallene herein has a unique lattice tangential strain, which can induce surface distortion while concurrently creating a variety of concave-convex featured micro-active regions formed by variously coordinated Pd sites agglomeration. Such a strong strain effect correlates the abnormal on-site active 4d(10)-t(2g)-orbital Coulomb correlation potential and directly elevates orbital-electronegativity exposure within these active regions, resulting in a preeminent barrier-free energetic path for significant enhancement of FAOR and HER catalytic performance.									19	2	0	0	0	0	19			2095-5138	2053-714X		WOS:000701659300013	34691734

During discharge, a nanometer-thin (< 5 nm) layer of Li2O2 forms homogeneously throughout the electrode before it is passivated at a final specific charge of similar to 365 mAh/g. Higher discharge charge rates lead to thinner and more densely packed layers of Li2O2. Electrolyte decomposition also occurs in parallel, as evidenced by the continuous increase of LiF and sulfur containing species of the degraded LiTFSI salt. On charge, O-2 evolves initially according to a 2e(-)/O-2 rate, but as the cell over-potentials increase, O-2 evolution rate approaches 4e(-)/O-2, thus demonstrating a significant extent of parasitic side-reactions. Unlike the discharge, the charge leads to inhomogeneous electrode reactions causing a continuous removal of Li2O2 with no indication of LiO2 or Li2O intermediates. The decomposition side-products formed during discharge are also removed and the spectra of the pristine electrode are nearly retained at a full charge. Our results show that the analysis of Li-O-2 battery chemistry requires broad approach based on the combination of various electrode surface sensitive techniques, such as XPS and OEMS, in order to provide further fundamental understanding of the mechanisms behind the complex electrochemistry involving the Li and O-2 as well as several other predominant degradation products of the electrode and electrolyte.

J	Remington, S. James								Fluorescent proteins: maturation, photochemistry and photophysics								CURRENT OPINION IN STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY				16	6			714	721		10.1016/j.sbi.2006.10.001				DEC 2006	2006	It has long been appreciated that green fluorescent protein (GFP) autocatalytically forms its chromophore in a host-independent process; several of the initial steps in the reaction have recently been elucidated. Nevertheless, the end points of the process are unexpectedly diverse, as six chemically distinct chromophores, including two with three rings, have been identified. All fluorescent proteins continuously produce a low level of reactive oxygen species under illumination, which, in some cases, can lead to host cell death. In one extreme but useful example, the red fluorescent protein Killer-Red can be used to selectively destroy cells upon brief illumination. Finally, when photophysical processes such as excited-state proton transfer, reversible photobleaching and photoactivation are understood, useful research tools, for example, real-time biosensors and optical highlighters, can result; however, side effects of their use may lead to significant artifacts in timedependent microscopy experiments.									236	4	1	0	165	0	242			0959-440X	1879-033X		WOS:000243061100008	17064887

Under reduced oxygen availability (hypoxia) major changes in gene expression are mediated by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF alphas). Tetrapods have three hif alpha genes, whereas zebrafish (Danio rerio) and other cyprinids have six due to a teleost lineage-specific genome duplication. We studied the transcriptional divergence of the six teleost-specific hif alphas by inspecting the tissue-specific transcription patterns in adult zebrafish and by monitoring the early developmental transcription of normoxia- and hypoxia-grown zebrafish embryos. Overall we observed the highest hif alpha mRNA levels in tissues that are important for hypoxic survival, including the brain, gill and heart. Of the paralogs that have not previously received attention (hif alpha-1A, hif alpha-2B and hif alpha-3B) especially the hif alpha-2B transcription levels suggest functional relevance. The hif alpha-1A/B paralogs that have considerable coding sequence divergence displayed more overall transcriptional divergence than the hif alpha-2A/B paralog pair. The hif alpha-2A/B paralogs that are similarly conserved in coding sequence had a divergent transcription pattern during early development. When zebrafish grown in modest hypoxia were compared to normoxia grown fish, only hif alpha-3A transcription was significantly altered. These results suggest that, in zebrafish, the evolutionary retention of each hif alpha paralog pair has involved unique patterns of coding sequence divergence, adult tissue-specific transcriptional divergence or developmental transcriptional divergence.

Our investigations have shown that 10 A mu M SA has an optimal effect in rice plants grown hydroponically. Pulse amplitude modulated chlorophyll fluorescence, low-temperature chlorophyll fluorescence, oxygen evolution (measured with Clark-type and Joliot-type electrodes) and P700 photo-oxidation measurements were carried out to assess the effect of SA on the activity of the photosynthetic apparatus. The levels of three important parameters associated with oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide, lipid peroxidation and proline content) were measured. The application of low concentration of SA significantly decreased the levels of hydrogen peroxide, lipid peroxidation and proline under Cd stress. The results revealed that low concentration of SA, applied in plants exposed to 150 A mu M CdCl2, significantly improves plant growth, photochemical activities of both photosystems, the electron flow from Q(A) to plastoquinone, energetic distribution between pigment-protein complexes and the kinetic parameters of oxygen-evolving reactions. This study suggests that exogenous application of 10 A mu M SA through the rooting medium has a protective effect against Cd toxicity in rice plants. The possible molecular mechanisms involved in the defence effect of SA on the function of photosynthetic apparatus are discussed.									21	1	0	0	16	0	22			2197-0025			WOS:000428018500006		
J	Allen, John F.				Allen, John/K-6309-2019	Allen, John/0000-0002-0950-0429			A Proposal for Formation of Archaean Stromatolites before the Advent of Oxygenic Photosynthesis								FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY				7						1784	10.3389/fmicb.2016.01784				NOV 15 2016	2016	Stromatolites are solid, laminar structures of biological origin. Living examples are sparsely distributed and formed by cyanobacteria, which are oxygenic phototrophs. However, stromatolites were abundant between 3.4 and 2.4 Gyr, prior to the advent of cyanobacteria and oxygenic photosynthesis. Here I propose that many Archaean stromatolites were seeded at points of efflux of hydrogen sulfide from hydrothermal fields into shallow water, while their laminar composition arose from alternating modes of strictly anoxygenic photosynthetic metabolism. These changes were a redox regulatory response of gene expression to changing hydrogen sulfide concentration, which fluctuated with intermittent dilution by tidal action or by rainfall into surface waters. The proposed redox switch between modes of metabolism deposited sequential microbial mats. These mats gave rise to alternating carbonate sediments predicted to retain evidence of their origin in differing ratios of isotopes of carbon and sulfur and in organic content. The mats may have arisen either by replacement of microbial populations or by continuous lineages of protocyanobacteria in which a redox genetic switch selected between Types I and II photosynthetic reaction centers, and thus between photolithoautotrophic and photoorganoheterotrophic metabolism. In the latter case, and by 2.4 Gyr at the latest, a mutation had disabled the redox genetic switch to give simultaneous constitutive expression of both Types I and II reaction centers, and thus to the ability to extract electrons from manganese and then water. By this simple step, the first cyanobacterium had the dramatic advantage of emancipation from limiting supplies of inorganic electron donors, produced free molecular oxygen as a waste product, and initiated the Great Oxidation Event in Earth's history at the transition from the Archaean to the Paleoproterozoic.									12	0	0	0	9	0	13			1664-302X			WOS:000388711000002	27895626	
J	Tracewell, CA; Brudvig, GW								Two redox-active beta-carotene molecules in Photosystem II								BIOCHEMISTRY				42	30			9127	9136		10.1021/bi0345844				AUG 5 2003	2003	Photosystem 11 (PS 11) contains secondary electron-transfer paths involving cytochrome b(559) (Cyt b(559)), chlorophyll (Chl), and beta-carotene (Car) that are active under conditions when oxygen evolution is blocked such as in inhibited samples or at low temperature. Intermediates of the secondary electron-transfer pathways of PS 11 core complexes from Synechocystis PCC 6803 and Synechococcus sp. and spinach PS 11 membranes have been investigated using low temperature near-IR spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. We present evidence that two spectroscopically distinct redox-active carotenoids are formed upon low-temperature illumination. The Car(+) near-IR absorption peak varies in wavelength and width as a function of illumination temperature. Also, the rate of decay during dark incubation of the Car(+) peak varies as a function of wavelength. Factor analysis indicates that there are two spectral forms of Car(+) (Car(A)(+) has an absorbance maximum of 982 run, and Car(B)(+) has an absorbance maximum of 1027 nm) that decay at different rates. In Synechocystis PS 11, we observe a shift of the Car(+) peak to shorter wavelength when oxidized tyrosine D (Y-D.) is present in the sample that is explained by an electrostatic interaction between Y-D. and a nearby beta-carotene that disfavors oxidation of Car(B). The sequence of electron-transfer reactions in the secondary electron-transfer pathways of PS 11 is discussed in terms of a hole-hopping mechanism to attain the equilibrated state of the charge separation at low temperatures.									51	0	0	0	40	0	53			0006-2960			WOS:000184499000023	12885246

However, the utilization of pure NiSe2 as electrode materials is limited by its poor cycling stability, low electrical conductivity, and insufficient electrochemically active sites. To remedy these defects, herein, a novel NiSe2/Ti3C2Tx hybrid with strong interfacial interaction and electrical properties is fabricated, by wrapping NiSe2 octahedral crystal with ultrathin Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheet. The NiSe2/Ti3C2Tx hybrid exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, with a high specific capacitance of 531.2Fg(-1) at 1Ag(-1) for supercapacitor, low overpotential of 200mV at 10mAg(-1), and small Tafel slope of 37.7mVdec(-1) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Furthermore, greater cycling stabilities for NiSe2/Ti3C2Tx hybrid in both supercapacitor and HER have also been achieved. These significant improvements compared with unmodified NiSe2 should be owing to the strong interfacial interaction between NiSe2 octahedral crystal and Ti3C2Tx MXene, which provides enhanced conductivity, fast charge transfer as well as abundant active sites, and highlight the promising potentials in combinations of MXene with metal selenides for multifunctional applications such as energy storage and conversion.									96	10	0	0	5	0	96			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000463753300001	34137972

Herein, multi-walled carbon nanotubes supported binary nickel cobalt selenide composite (Ni-Co-Se/CNT) was prepared by a one-pot-hydrothermal method using hydrazine ions that enables the selenium to diffuse and react with the Ni-and Co-cations to form Ni-Co-Se with a stable nanostructure onto the outer walls of the CNT platforms due to the coordination interaction between the metallic cations and surface oxygen-containing group of the conductive scaffolds. The electrochemical performances for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) are accessed in an alkaline medium by cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronopotentiometry (CA), and electrochemical impedancespectroscopy (EIS) tests. The as-prepared Ni-Co-Se/CNT hybrid presents an excellent electrocatalytic activity in terms of current density and onset potential due to synergistic effects of tubular CNT scaffolds, additional Co active sites, and electrochemically active NiOOH layer. The CNTs support markedly enhanced the electrocatalytic properties by providing a rapid mass transport for UOR because of their porous network architectures with a robust adhesion to the Ni-Co-Se nanocrystals. Thus, the synthetic methodology synthetic methodology adopted here is entirely effective for constructing various metal selenide compounds in future.									26	1	0	0	1	0	27			2196-0216			WOS:000482342800001

Fundamental insight into the identification of the structure of active sites and structural contributions for catalytic performance are still lacking. Recently, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and density functional theory (DFT) provide important tools to disclose the electronic, geometric and catalytic natures of active sites. Herein, we demonstrate the structural identification of Zn-N-2 active sites with both experimental/theoretical X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra. Further DFT calculations reveal that the oxygen species activation on Zn-N-2 active sites is significantly enhanced, which can accelerate the reduction of oxygen with high selectivity, according well with the experimental results. This work highlights the identification and investigation of Zn-N-2 active sites, providing a regular principle to obtain deep insight into the nature of catalysts for various catalytic applications.									61	3	0	0	7	0	61			2041-1723			WOS:000471228300001	31197162

Electrocatalytic water oxidation to evolve O-2, utilizing suitable low-cost catalysts and renewable electricity, is of fundamental importance considering contemporary energy and environmental issues, yet it is kinetically challenging owing to the complex multiproton/electron transfer processes. Herein, we report the first cobalt-based pincer catalyst for catalytic water oxidation at neutral pH with high efficiency under electrochemical conditions. Most importantly, ligand (pseudo)aromaticity is identified to play an important role during electrocatalysis. A significant potential jump (similar to 300 mV) was achieved toward a lower positive value when the aromatized cobalt complex was transformed into a (pseudo)-dearomatized cobalt species. The dearomatized species catalyzes the water oxidation reaction to evolve oxygen at a much lower overpotential (similar to 340 mV) on the basis of the onset potential (at a current density of 0.5 mA/cm(2)) of catalysis at pH 10.5, outperforming other Co-based molecular catalysts reported to date. These observations may provide a new strategy for the judicious design of earth-abundant transition-metal-based water oxidation catalysts.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000643574200016	33236627

The catalytic activity originates from the photogeneration of excited electrons in the conduction bands of both TiO2 and CuO resulting in a build-up of excess electrons in the conduction band of CuO. Consequently, the accumulation of excess electrons in CuO causes a negative shift in the Fermi level of CuO. The efficient interparticle charge transfer leads to a higher catalytic activity and the formation of highly reduced states of TiO2/CuO, which are stable even under oxygen saturated condition. Negative shift in the Fermi level of CuO of the catalyst TiO2/CuO gains the required overvoltage necessary for efficient water reduction reaction. The function of CuO is to help the charge separation and to act as a water reduction site. The amount of CuO and crystalline structure were found to be crucial for the catalytic activity and the optimum CuO loading was ca. similar to 5-10% (w/w).									249	20	0	0	17	0	260			1474-905X	1474-9092		WOS:000232845900001	16252040

A major challenge is the stable decoration of various substrates with a high density of individually dispersed and uniformly active monatomic sites. Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) are broadly investigated catalysts, limited by the relative inertness of their pristine basal plane. We propose that TMC single layers modified by substitutional heteroatoms can harvest the synergistic benefits of stably anchored single-atom catalysts and activated TMC basal planes. These solid-solution TMC catalysts offer advantages such as simple and versatile synthesis, unmatched active site density, and a stable and well-defined single-atom active site chemical environment. The unique features of heteroatom-doped two-dimensional TMC crystals at the origin of their catalytic activity are discussed through the examples of various TMC single layers doped with individual oxygen heteroatoms.									29	2	0	0	1	0	29			2380-8195			WOS:000480672800019	31763462

The deposit, northeast of the Rachmaninoff basin, is depleted in S (relative to Ca and Si) and C, compared with the rest of Mercury's surface. Spectral reflectance measurements of the deposit indicate relatively high overall reflectance and an oxygen-metal charge transfer (OMCT) absorption band at ultraviolet wavelengths. These results are consistent with oxidation of graphite and sulfides during magma ascent, via reaction with oxides in the magma or assimilated country rock, and the formation of S-and C-bearing volatile species. Consumption of graphite during oxidation could account for the elevated reflectance of the pyroclastic material, and the strength of the OMCT band is consistent with similar to 0.03-0.1 wt% FeO in the deposit.									40	2	0	0	0	0	42			0094-8276	1944-8007		WOS:000378338800005

Plasmas from metal targets were generated by focusing 1064 nm, 6 ns pulses from an Nd:YAG laser. Gas-phase oxidation/plasma chemistry was initiated by adding O-2 (partial pressures up to asymptotic to 20%) to an N-2 environment where the total background pressure was kept at a constant 1 atmosphere. Temporally resolved emission spectral features were used to track the gas-phase oxidation. The dynamics of atomic and molecular species were monitored using space-resolved time-of-flight emission spectroscopy. Our results highlight that the partial pressure of O-2 strongly influences spectral features and molecular formation in laser-produced plasmas. Atoms and molecules co-exist in plasmas, although with different temporal histories depending on the target material due to differences in thermo- and plasma chemical reactions occurring in the plume.& nbsp;& nbsp;Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1070-664X	1089-7674		WOS:000799091300003

For 5 mmol/L NiCl2 + 0.1 mol/L NaCl, pH 3.0, electrolytes, the voltammetric current at modest overpotentials, i.e., between -0.6 and -1.4 V vs Ag/AgCl, was distributed between metal deposition and H3O+ reduction, with both reactions reaching mass transport-limited current values. At more negative potentials, an unusual sharp current spike appeared upon the onset of H2O reduction that was accompanied by a transient increase in H-2 production. The peak potential of the current spike was a function of both [Ni(H2O)(6)](2+)(aq) concentration and pH. The sharp rise in current was ascribed to the onset of autocatalytic H2O reduction, where electrochemically generated OH species induce heterogeneous nucleation of Ni(OH)(2)(ads) islands, the perimeter of which is reportedly active for H2O reduction. As the layer coalesces, further metal deposition is quenched while H2O reduction continues, albeit at a decreased rate as fewer of the most reactive sites, e.g., Ni/Ni(OH)(2) island edges, are available. At potentials below -1.5 V vs Ag/AgCl, H2O reduction is accelerated, leading to homogeneous precipitation of bulk Ni(OH)(2)xH(2)O within the nearly hemispherical diffusion layer of the UME.									23	0	0	0	2	0	23			1932-7447			WOS:000389624400041	28217241

The resultant chars were characterised in terms of texture and thermal behaviour. Textural characterisation of the chars was carried out by N-2 and CO2 adsorption isotherms at -196 and 0 degreesC, respectively. Char isothermal reactivity in air at 500 degreesC, and in CO2 at 1000 degreesC, was performed in a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA). Temperature-programmed combustion tests under 20% oxygen in argon were also performed in the TGA linked to a mass spectrometer (TGA/MS). The results showed that char textural properties do not always relate well to their reactivity. Not only do physical properties (e.g. surface area, porosity) but also chemical properties (e.g. active sites concentration and distribution) play an important role in the reaction of carbonaceous material and oxidant. On the other hand, in terms of chemical composition the chars obtained from the mixture of carbon compounds were very similar to the chars produced under the same experimental conditions by a high volatile bituminous coal. The fact that carbon compounds are well known makes it easier to obtain knowledge about the functional groups present in synthetic char, and to study the mechanisms of heterogeneous reactions such as the reduction of NO with carbon.

Precise control of the amount of NH3 solution injected into a mixture of Ag2O nanocrystals and NaOH enables this face-selective etching. Ag(NH3)(2)(+) formed from dissolved silver ions should drive the etching process while NaOH tunes the reaction equilibrium to control morphology of the etched nanocrystals. The order of facet stability in this reaction was found to be {111} > {110} > {100}. The {100} faces are most easily etched. By carefully adjusting the volume of NH3 solution introduced, novel Ag2O cubic nanoframes and rhombicuboctahedra with square depressions on all the {100} faces can be fabricated. The {111} facets contain significant terminal silver atoms, so hydroxide ions should interact strongly to maintain these surfaces. Hydroxide ions are less effective at adsorbing on the {100} faces with terminal oxygen atoms, so these faces are more susceptible to etching. zeta potential measurements support the argument of hydroxide ion adsorption. Interestingly, the {100} facets of Ag2O were found to be most stable in a weakly acidic HNO3 solution; octahedral nanocrystals can transform into particles consisted of {100} square terraces.									74	3	0	0	6	0	75			1932-7447			WOS:000294701600021

Electrochemical investigations of these electronically conductive films carried out in a 0.8 mol dm(-3) KCl + 5.0 mmol dm(-3) KOH solution show that incorporation of oxide nanoparticles decreases porosity of the polymer matrix. The average apparent diffusion coefficient (D-a) value of dopant (Cl-) is observed to be approximately 3 times higher in a pure PPy-film compared to composite one. The sum of the film and solution resistances, though higher with the composite electrode, remained practically constant under cathodic polarization conditions. In contrast to a non-composite electrode of the same oxide, the composite electrode exhibited much better electrocatalytic activity and remarkable stability for O-2 reduction reaction (ORR).									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1480-2422			WOS:000232617100009

The physical-chemical properties of carbon-based catalysts associated with their catalytic abilities were characterized by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS) and N2 adsorption. The relationship between the specific reactivity and tar reforming ability of carbon-based catalysts was discussed through a micro fluidized bed reaction analyzer (MFBRA-MR). The results indicate that the char-based catalyst has a certain removal ability for in-situ biomass tar of corn straw in an inert atmosphere, which is as follows: sawdust biochar > Zhundong (ZD) coal char > graphite. During the in-situ tar reforming, the alkali and alkaline earth metal species (AAEMs) act as adsorption/reaction sites, affecting the evolution of the aromatic ring structure and oxygen-containing functional groups of the char-based catalyst, and also its pore structure. AAEM species on the surface of char-based catalysts are the active sites for tar reforming, which promotes the increase of active intermediates (C-O bond and C-O-AAEMs), and enhances the interactions between char-based catalysts and biomass tar. The abundant AAEMs may lead to the conversion of O=C-O and C=O to C-O. For tar reforming, the internal pore structure of char-based catalysts is little changed, mainly with the carbon deposit forming on the surface pore structure. The carbon deposit from the reformation of straw tar on the char surface has better reactivity than the inherent carbon structure of ZD coal char and sawdust biochar. There is a positive relationship between the MFBRA-MR specific reactivity and tar catalytic reforming ability of char-based catalysts (decided by the coupling effect in their physical-chemical structure), which can be used to determine the catalytic ability of char-based catalysts on tar reforming directly.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10				2073-4344		WOS:000489178000013

Transition metal carbides, in particular beta-phase Mo2C, are garnering increased attention as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts due to their favourable synthesis conditions, stability and high catalytic efficiency. We use a thermodynamic approach in conjunction with density functional theory and a kinetic model of exchange current density to systematically study the HER activity of beta-Mo2C under different experimental conditions. We show that the (011) surface has the highest HER activity, which is rationalized by its lack of strong Mo-based hydrogen adsorption sites. Thus, the HER efficiency of beta-Mo2C can be tuned using nanoparticles (NPs) that expose larger fractions of this termination. We give definite maps between NP morphologies and experimental synthesis conditions, and show that the control of the carbon chemical potential during synthesis can expose up to 90% of the (011) surface, while ambient H-2 has little effect on the NP morphology. The "volcano" plot shows that under these optimum conditions, the NP exchange current density is similar to 10(-5) A cm(-2), that is only slightly smaller than that of Pt (111).									33	1	0	0	1	0	32			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000396044400037	28225110

Tungsten carbide-based materials have been widely investigated recently as promising supports to platinum (Pt) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the loading capacity and the fixed stability of Pt are still the main problems to be faced with. Herein we demonstrate a strategy which can be used for massproduction for preparing a thickness-controllable double core-shell WC@C@Pt structure, based on a half combustion synthesis-carbonation method. By adjusting the carbon content of the precursors, the thickness of carbon layer covering the surface of tungsten carbide and the insertion depth of Pt particles into the carbon layer are controllable during the carbonation process. The carbon layer can fix the platinum particles as well as improve the electrical conductivity. This unique structure maintains a highly efficient and stable catalytic process, leading to its excellent performance for HER with low overpotentials and small Tafel slopes in acidic/alkaline solution. This study provides some guidelines for the large-scale synthesis of nanostructured electrocatalysts.									21	2	0	0	1	0	22			2405-8297			WOS:000418533600028

The migration of the platinum over the carbon support was analyzed by means of identical location transmission electron microscopy (IL-TEM). While at potentials of 0.1 and 0 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), no changes to the Pt/C material were observed. With a decrease of the overpotential to -0.1 V vs. RHE, an increase in the quantity of migrating platinum particles took place. At -0.2 V vs. RHE, a further rise in the particle migration was observed. The effect of the overpotential on the migration was explained by a higher hydrogen generation rate, the formation of a hydrogen monolayer on the platinum and the resulting changes of the platinum support distance. The mechanisms revealed in this study could describe a relevant source of degradation of PEM water electrolyzers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The simulations are performed using KIVA-3V computer code coupled with reduced chemical kinetics. Low (40 per cent) to heavy (70 per cent) EGR rates are applied to study the effects of reduced intake oxygen concentration on combustion and emissions. Model predictions of cylinder pressure and emissions are first validated against experimental data. Model-predicted temporal and spatial evolution of in-cylinder mixture in phi-T coordinates is then used to explain the fundamentals of PCCI combustion and emissions. Using computational analysis, it is shown that lower exhaust soot emissions for the lower EGR dilution cases (45 per cent) are due to higher soot oxidation rates, and lower exhaust soot emissions for very high EGR rates (70 per cent) are due to lower soot formation rates. The trend seen in NOx emissions are primarily attributable to the inert effect of EGR dilution and varied ignition delay caused by varied percentages of oxygen in the intake mixture.									20	1	0	0	0	0	21			1468-0874			WOS:000261099100002

In particular, the large over potential of positive electrode reactions during the charging process results in low round-trip energy efficiency and limited cycle life, and is therefore the main barrier to the practical use of rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries. In the present study, we demonstrate that the charging performance of Li-O-2 batteries can be significantly improved by simply adding barium (Ba) ions into the electrolyte. Elemental analysis revealed that Ba-incorporated Li-O-2 was obtained as the main discharge product of a Li-O-2 cell operated in the presence of Ba2+. Notably, the improvement of charging performance was confirmed to originate from the Ba-incorporated Li-O-2 deposits, rather than the Ba2+ present in the electrolyte. The present results suggest that the incorporation of heteroatoms into the discharge product is an effective approach for improving the charging performance of Li-O-2 batteries.

The phase evolution, luminescence, persistent luminescence, and thermal stabilities of GAGG:Ce3+ sintered in an O-2 atmosphere and annealed in a CO reducing atmosphere at different temperatures were investigated. Comparing with the samples sintered only in O-2, the samples annealed in CO show higher luminescence and afterglow and better thermal stability. Under 445 nm excitation, the luminescence and afterglow of GAGG:Ce3+ are similar with each other, displaying a broad yellow emission with a peak around 545 nm. By optimizing the sintering process, the internal quantum efficiency can reach as high as 71.3%. The time tau(80) is about 15 ms, which is much longer than 0.4 ms required for alternating current (AC)-LEDs. These results indicate the promising application of the GAGG:Ce3+ persistent phosphor for reducing flicker from AC-LEDs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Altarawneh, Khaled; Altarawneh, Mohammednoor								Bromination mechanisms of aromatic pollutants: formation of Br-2 and bromine transfer from metallic oxybromides								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH				29	20			30126	30133		10.1007/s11356-021-17650-9		JAN 2022		APR 2022	2022	Bromination mechanisms of aromatic pollutants assume a chief contribution in the observed yields and pattern's distribution of a wide array of dioxin-like toxicants. However, salient features of the governing pathways remain largely speculative. This study presents detail mechanistic insights into two commonly discussed routes; namely: surface-assisted conversion of HBr into Br-2 and direct bromine transfer from oxybromides into a benzene ring. Utilizing iron surfaces, as structural representative of the metallic content in electronic wastes, results from density functional theory calculations portray accessible reactions into the successive dissociative adsorption of HBr over the Fe(100) surface and the subsequent evolution of gas phase bromine molecules. Activation energies for HBr uptake by the plain iron surface reside in the range of 129-182 kJ/ mol. Over an oxygen pre-covered surface, dissociative adsorption of HBr leading to bromine molecules requires significantly lower activation energies (45-78 kJ/mol). Likewise, bromination of a benzene ring into a monobromobenzene molecule over Fe(100)_O*Br* (i.e., an oxybromide) configuration ensues with an opening activation energy of similar to 165 kJ/mol. Adsorption of a phenyl radical over an iron-oxybromide forms a phenolate moiety that subsequently desorbs from the surface into a phenoxy radical. Reaction pathways presented herein shall be useful in the ongoing efforts to comprehend the formation and bromination routes of the notorious bromine-bearing pollutants in real scenarios, such as, these encountered in the open burning and primitive thermal recycling of electronic wastes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0944-1344	1614-7499		WOS:000740214300026	34997481

In this study, we report direct evidence of the formation of soluble LiO2 upon the oxidation of Li2O2 and reveal a strong solvent-controlled Li2O2-oxidation reaction mechanism. We exploit a thin-film rotating ring-disk electrode to show that soluble LiO2 is generated when oxidizing Li2O2 in high-donicity solvent but is absent in low-donicity glyme-based solvent Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy further proved the presence of LiO2 upon Li2O2 oxidation in high-donicity solvent but not in low-donicity solvent. We show that preferential formation of soluble LiO2 in the high-donicity solvent could account for poor cycling stability, which suggests that strategies that bypass the formation of soluble LiO2 upon Li2O2 oxidation are critical. Our work offers new insights in resolving the discrepancy in Li-O-2 charging mechanism and design strategies to achieve efficient and long-life Li-O-2 batteries.									95	2	0	0	2	1	96			2542-4351			WOS:000450940600017

The CCSD(T) data can be combined with thermochemical cycles to estimate chemisorption and physisorption energies for each metal from metal oxide embedding energies, in good correlation with atomization enthalpies (R-2=0.75). Spin-geometry variations can break the linearities, of interest to circumventing the Sabatier principle. Pt, Pd, Co, and Fe form a distinct group with the weakest O(2)binding. R(2)up to 0.84 between surface adsorption energies and our energies for MO(2)systems indicate relevance also to real catalytic systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000564045400001	32757346

We present a three-dimensional numerical simulation of a Rayleigh-Taylor unstable carbon flame, following its evolution through the transition to turbulence. A low-Mach number hydrodynamics method is used, freeing us from the harsh time step restrictions imposed by sound waves. We fully resolve the thermal structure of the flame and its reaction zone, eliminating the need for a flame model. A single density is considered, 1.5 x 10(7) g cm(-3), and half-carbon, half-oxygen fuel: conditions under which the flame propagated in the flamelet regime in our related two-dimensional study. We compare to a corresponding two- dimensional simulation and show that while fire polishing keeps the small features suppressed in two dimensions, turbulence wrinkles the flame on far smaller scales in the three-dimensional case, suggesting that the transition to the distributed burning regime occurs at higher densities in three dimensions. Detailed turbulence diagnostics are provided. We show that the turbulence follows a Kolmogorov spectrum and is highly anisotropic on the large scales, with a much larger integral scale in the direction of gravity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it becomes more isotropic as it cascades down to small scales. On the basis of the turbulent statistics and the flame properties of our simulation, we compute the Gibson scale. We show the progress of the turbulent flame through a classic combustion regime diagram, indicating that the flame just enters the distributed burning regime near the end of our simulation.									93	3	0	0	0	0	93			0004-637X			WOS:000232569100031

The thermal decomposition of SPL occurred mainly between 450 and 800 degrees C. Based on the four kinetic methods of Friedman, Starink, Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa under the various conversion degrees (alpha) from 0.1 to 0.7, the lowest apparent activation energy was estimated at 149.81 kJ/mol in the 70% CO2 /30% O-2 atmosphere. The pre-exponential factor, and changes in entropy, enthalpy and free Gibbs energy were also estimated. The reaction model did not suggest a single reaction of the SPL combustion. With the alpha value of 0.25-0.7, the following function best described the reaction based on the Malek method: f(alpha) = 1/2 alpha and G(alpha) = ln alpha(2). The gases released during the combustion process included CO2, CO, NOx, HCN, and HF. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									23	1	0	0	6	0	23			0956-053X			WOS:000470947700024	31109523

The physicochemical characterizations of the modified photoanodes showed the uniform incorporation of gold nanoparticles having a diameter range of 3-5 nm into the mesoporous TiO2 substrate. The photo-electrochemical investigations demonstrate that the Au/m-TiO2 modified catalysts under the simulated solar light illumination exhibit excellent photoelectrochemical activity for alkali water oxidation and photocurrent density of 1.30 mA/cm(2) has been achieved within the potential window of 0.1-1.7 V vs. reference hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is a 2.5 times higher photocurrent than that observed at bare m-TiO2 anode. An apparent oxygen evolution rate of 45.80 mmol/mg h was observed at a potential of 1.25 V vs RHE for Au/m-TiO2 which is significantly higher than that obtained for bare m-TiO2 (12.5 mmol/mg h). The mesoporous TiO2 materials modified with suitable metal nanoparticles via ex-situ photodeposition have shown substantial current gain during the photo-electrochemical water splitting reaction due to the boosting effect of the plasmonic nanostructure.

However, the recycling of used LIBs is limited by the complicated separation processes of traditional pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy methods. Here, we applied a rapid thermal radiation method to convert spent LiNi1-x-yMnxCoyO2 (NMC) cathodes from used LIBs into highly efficient NiMnCo-based catalysts for zinc-air batteries (ZABs) through acid leaching and radiative heating processes, which avoids sophisticated separation of different metals and can synthesize the catalysts rapidly. The prepared NiMnCo-activated carbon (NiMnCo-AC) catalyst presents a unique core-shell structure, with facecentered cubic Ni in the core and spinel NiMnCoO4 in the shell, which redistributes the electronic structure of the NiMnCoO4 shell to decrease the energy barrier for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes and ensures high electrocatalytic activities. The NiMnCo-AC catalyst in ZABs as cathode materials exhibits a high power density of 187.7 mW cm(-2), low voltage gap of 0.72 V at the initial three cycles, and long cycling duration of 200 h at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This work provides a promising strategy to recycle spent LIBs to highly efficient catalysts for ZABs.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0027-8424	1091-6490		WOS:000854008900010	35533280

Standard models, that ignite carbon at densities higher than 2 - 4 10(9) g/cm3, give, however, a large production of species like Fe-54, Ni-58, and Cr-54, which has been regarded as incompatible with the Solar System abundances. In this paper we analyze the weight of the constraints imposed by nucleosynthesis of the Fe-peak nuclides to the aforementioned scenario for Type la supernovae when the contribution of Type II and Type lb supernovae to the galactic iron abundances is also taken into account, that in the context of a simplified model of chemical evolution of the Galaxy. We find that the production of the aforementioned nuclides predicted by standard SNIa models is in fact compatible with the Solar System abundances when the yields from gravitational-collapse supernovae are adjusted to reproduce the Ni abundances in low-metallicity stars.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0004-6361			WOS:A1993KU56700032

In situ analysis of delta O-18 was performed with 3 and 15 mu m beam spots by secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS) on detrital quartz grains and quartz overgrowths. These results from thin lenses within impermeable mudstones reflect samples that were sealed from basin-wide fluid flow and compliment previous studies of more permeable sandstones. Individual grains of detrital quartz (DQ) are homogeneous in delta O-18. The average delta O-18 values in fine-grained detrital quartz in mudstones and siltstones and in coarser-grained quartz in the Eau Claire Fm., Mt. Simon and St. Peter Sandstones (Ss.) are essentially identical at delta O-18 - 10 parts per thousand VSMOW, suggesting that detrital quartz is dominantly igneous in origin. The delta O-18 values of overgrowth quartz (OQ) of buried samples from the Illinois Basin are higher and quartz overgrowths are systematically zoned outward from the detrital cores. These gradients are similar to those from the underlying Mt. Simon Ss., and are best explained by increasing temperatures during burial. Pressure solution is evident in thin section and may have supplied significant silica for overgrowths. In contrast to the deeply buried samples from the Illinois Basin, quartz overgrowths in samples from the Wisconsin Arch are homogeneous and higher in delta O-18. Those overgrowths are interpreted as quartz cements formed in a near-surface environment (<40 degrees C), which is consistent with geological evidence that these rocks were only shallowly buried (<500 m). Based on these delta O-18(OQ) results and the modeled thermal history during burial of the basin, the earliest-formed quartz overgrowths were produced at low temperature from low delta O-18(water) around 450 Ma. The delta O-18 values in traverses of single overgrowths decrease by up to 9.1 parts per thousand, showing continued cementation with increased burial, pressure solution, and heating until similar to 250 Ma. In traverses of the outermost zone of some overgrowths, oxygen isotope values become constant or increase slightly, possibly due to clay mineral dehydration reactions or later fluid infiltration. We present a new cementation and basin evolution model, in which the delta O-18 of cement correlates to the age of formation and the late overgrowths formed between 270 and 250 Ma, during and/or after the migration of brines that formed the Pb-Zn deposits of the Upper Mississippi Valley District (270 Ma). Cementation around 270 Ma would have reduced permeability, possibly ending the flow of ore forming brines. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To address this, the present work scrutinises the properties of antimony-metal (Co, Mn, Ni, Fe, Ru) oxides synthesised as flat thin film electrodes by a solution-based method for water electrooxidation in 0.5 M H2SO4. Among the noble-metal-free catalysts, cobalt-antimony and manganese-antimony oxides demonstrate robust performance under ambient conditions, but slowly lose activity at elevated temperatures. A distinctive feature of the ruthenium-antimony system is its outstanding stability demonstrated herein through up to 8 day-long tests at 80 +/- 1 degrees C, during which the reaction rate of 10 mA cm(-2) was maintained at a stable overpotential of 0.34 +/- 0.01 V. The S-number for this catalyst is on par with those for the high-performance benchmark Ir-based systems. Density functional theory analysis and detailed physical characterisation reveal that this high stability is supported by the enhanced hybridisation of the oxygen p- and metal d-orbitals induced by antimony and can arise from two distinct structural scenarios: either formation of an antimonate phase, or nanoscale intermixing of metal and antimony oxide crystallites.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000723806700001

Using comprehensive and integrated biophysical methods we characterized three sugar beet Hbs: BvHb1.1, BvHb1.2 and BvHb2. Their affinities for oxygen, CO, and hexacoordination were determined. Their role in nitrogen metabolism was studied by assessing their ability to bind NO, to reduce nitrite (NiR, nitrite reductase), and to form nitrate (NOD, NO dioxygenase). Results show that BvHb1.2 has high NOD-like activity, in agreement with the high nitrate levels found in seeds where this protein is expressed. BvHb1.1, on the other side, is equally capable to bind NO as to form nitrate, its main role would be to protect chloroplasts from the deleterious effects of NO. Finally, the ubiquitous, reactive, and versatile BvHb2, able to adopt 'open and closed forms', would be part of metabolic pathways where the balance between oxygen and NO is essential. For all proteins, the NiR activity is relevant only when nitrite is present at high concentrations and both NO and oxygen are absent. The three proteins have distinct intrinsic capabilities to react with NO, oxygen and nitrite; however, it is their concentration which will determine the BvHbs' activity.									11	1	0	0	8	0	11			0264-6021	1470-8728		WOS:000478786300007	31285352

The BTO layer thicknesses were in the range of 20-60nm, and typical breakdown fields were in the range of 1.5-3.0MV/cm. Electron microscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) were used to provide information about the degradation mechanism. High-resolution imaging revealed widespread structural damage in the BTO films after breakdown had occurred, with substantial polycrystallinity as well as amorphous regions. EELS analysis of the stressed films showed characteristic signatures of valence change in the Ti L-23 EELS spectra associated with the accumulation of oxygen vacancies. Stressed heterostructures that had been patterned by electron lithography showed similar trends, including degraded crystallinity as well as oxygen loss.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2166-2746			WOS:000569109900024

In order to investigate the P-T-time-fluid evolution of the whiteschists, we obtained U-Pb ages from zircon and monazite and combined those with trace element composition and oxygen isotopes of the accessory minerals and coexisting garnet. Zircon cores are the only remnants of the granitic protolith and still preserve a Permian age, magmatic trace element compositions and delta O-18 of similar to 10 %. Thermodynamic modelling of Si-rich and Si-poor whiteschist compositions shows that there are two main fluid pulses during prograde subduction between 20 and 40 kbar. In Si-poor samples, the breakdown of chlorite to garnet + fluid occurs at similar to 22 kbar. A first zircon rim directly overgrowing the cores has inclusions of prograde phlogopite and HREE-enriched patterns indicating zircon growth at the onset of garnet formation. A second main fluid pulse is documented close to peak metamorphic conditions in both Si-rich and Si-poor whiteschist when talc + kyanite react to garnet + coesite + fluid. A second metamorphic overgrowth on zircon with HREE depletion was observed in the Si-poor whiteschists, whereas a single metamorphic overgrowth capturing phengite and talc inclusions was observed in the Si-rich whiteschists. Garnet rims, zircon rims and monazite are in chemical and isotopic equilibrium for oxygen, demonstrating that they all formed at peak metamorphism at 35 Ma as constrained by the age of monazite (34.7 +/- 0.4 Ma) and zircon rims (35.1 +/- 0.8 Ma). The prograde zircon rim in Si-poor whiteschists has an age that is within error indistinguishable from the age of peak metamorphic conditions, consistent with a minimum rate of subduction of 2 cm/ year for the Dora-Maira unit. Oxygen isotope values for zircon rims, monazite and garnet are equal within error at 6.4 +/- 0.4 %, which is in line with closed-system equilibrium fractionation during prograde to peak temperatures. The resulting equilibrium. Delta O-18(zircon-monazite) at 700 +/- 20 degrees C is 0.1 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand. The in situ oxygen isotope data argue against an externally derived input of fluids into the whiteschists. Instead, fluidassisted zircon and monazite recrystallisation can be linked to internal dehydration reactions during prograde subduction. We propose that the major metasomatic event affecting the granite protolith was related to hydrothermal seafloor alteration post-dating Jurassic rifting, well before the onset of Alpine subduction.									55	5	0	0	1	0	57			0010-7999	1432-0967		WOS:000371062700005

These stresses are significantly increased by the formation of a Thermally Grown Oxide (TGO) layer that forms through the oxidation of mainly aluminium in the bondcoat layer of the TBC. As shown in previous work done by the authors, the topcoat-bondcoat interface roughness plays a major role in the development of the stress profile in the topcoat and significantly affects the lifetime of TBCs. This roughness profile varies as the TGO layer grows and changes the stress profile in the topcoat leading to crack propagation and thus failure.In this work, a two-dimensional TGO growth model is presented, based on oxygen and aluminium diffusion-reaction equations, using real interface profiles extracted from cross-section micrographs. The model was first validated by comparing the TGO profiles artificially created by the model to thermally cycled specimens with varying interface roughness. Thereafter, stress profiles in the TBC system, before and after the TGO layer growth, were estimated using a finite element modelling model described in previous work done by the authors. Three experimental specimens consisting of the same chemistry but with different topcoat-bondcoat interface roughness were studied by the models and the stress state was compared to the lifetimes measured experimentally. The combination of the two models described in this work was shown to be an effective approach to assess the stress behaviour and lifetime of TBCs in a comparative way. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Sheng Wang; Fei You; Shi-qiang Hu; Ya Zhou; Wei Sun								Effects of Bulk Densities and Inlet Airflow Velocities on Forward Smoldering Propagation Properties of Flexible Polyurethane Foam								Procedia Engineering				211				762	7		10.1016/j.proeng.2017.12.073				2018	2018	Smoldering processes of flexible polyurethane foam (FPUF) with densities of 20.0, 30.0 and 35.0 kg/m3 were simulated in a self-designed mesoscale generator with dimensions of 60.0 cm times 25.0 cm times 25.0 cm. Characteristic parameters like smoldering establishment time, average smoldering rate, smoldering temperature, and high temperature duration were proposed and analyzed at five different air flow rates of 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0 and 7.0 L/min. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate the morphological evolution of bulk materials before establishment and propagation of smoldering. Air was forced in the direction of approximately one-dimensional forward propagation. Results show that FPUF (20.0 kg/m3) has the shortest average smoldering establishment time of 1828.0 s at five airflow rates, FPUF (30.0 kg/m3) has the longest average smoldering establishment time of 2646.0 s. The average smoldering rate of FPUF (35.0 kg/m3) is higher than that of FPUF (30.0 kg/m). Smoldering of FPUF (20.0 kg/m3) cannot be self-sustained, due to largest porosity and insufficient heat accumulation. The average smoldering temperature and duration of high temperature values of FPUF (30.0 kg/m3) are higher than those of FPUF (35.0 kg/m3), and the highest average smoldering temperature of FPUF (30.0 kg/m3) is 410.0 degC. Since smoldering is derived from chemical reactions of oxygen transported and pyrolyzed products, the bulk material with low density shows higher porosity and contains more oxygen, it burns more fully and thus smoldering establishment time is less. In the process of smoldering, the oxidation and exothermic effects of porous carbon-based chars and oxygen is the main source of energy for the self-sustaining propagation of smoldering. The porosity of FPUF with high density (35.0 kg/m3) is lower, the burning produces a porous carbonate residue and limits the heat loss on the surface, so the smoldering rate of FPUF (35.0 kg/m3) is faster.

In this study, molybdenum phosphide/porous carbon (MoP/C) composites as Pt-supports and co-catalysts for the MOR are prepared by varying the molar ratio of citric acid (CiA) to glucose (Glu). Pt-MoP/C-2 (CiA : Glu = 2) has far higher electro-catalytic activity (platinum electrochemical surface area and mass activity) and durability for the MOR than commercial Pt/C. Because of the close integration between MoP and carbon and the ligand effect of Mo-P bonds, MoP/C can maintain a commendable stability for facilitating the fast transport of electrons. A fast oxidative removal of CO can reduce the adsorption of poisoning species (CO and CHO) onto the surface active sites of Pt and lead to the regeneration of active sites in Pt-MoP/C. Furthermore, the surface of MoP/C contains abundant absorbed -OH (hydrophilic) and oxygen-containing functional groups originating from the O-2 passivation, which promotes the dispersion of deposited Pt and the mass transfer of fuel. This study provides useful information for the design and preparation of a state-of-the-art anodic electro-catalyst support with promising co-catalytic effects for the MOR.									43	4	0	0	0	0	47			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000376091600021		
J	Palmer, LA; Gaston, B; Johns, RA								Normoxic stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 expression and activity: Redox-dependent effect of nitrogen oxides								MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY				58	6			1197	1203		10.1124/mol.58.6.1197				DEC 2000	2000	Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is an essential transcription factor involved in the oxygen-dependent regulation of gene expression. Thiol groups in HIF-1 or in proteins that modify HIF-1 are conventional targets for regulation by nitric oxide (NO). Moreover, NO delivery to tissue by hemoglobin appears to be oxygen dependent. Therefore, the role NO plays in regulating HIF-1 activity and expression was examined. The 1-substituted diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate NOC-18 induced HIF-1 DNA-binding activity in normoxic bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells and rat aortic smooth muscle cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Induction of HIF-1-binding activity was consistent with an increased expression of HIF-1 subunit proteins HIF-1 alpha and HIF-1 beta. The effect of NOC-18 on HIF-1 activity was blocked by cycloheximide, consistent with a posttranscriptional effect. NOC-18 induction of HIF-1 DNA-binding activity was not blocked with oxyhemoglobin, nor was it related to the rate of NO evolution, arguing against NO-mediation of the effect. Additionally, the effect of NOC-18 could not be mimicked by Angeli's salt, arguing against nitroxyl mediation. However, the NOC-18 effect could be reproduced by S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), an endogenous nitrosonium donor formed in the presence of deoxyhemoglobin. Furthermore, the GSNO effect could be reversed by dithiothreitol as well as acivicin, an inhibitor of GSNO bioactivation. Taken together, these results suggest that an S-nitrosylation reaction stabilizes HIF-1 protein expression and activity. We speculate that one signaling mechanism by which deoxyhemoglobin may activate HIF-1 involves NO.									167	5	1	0	146	0	172			0026-895X			WOS:000165497900004	11093754

The construction of p-n junction nanostructures by coupling of highly stable Co3O4 in aqueous alkaline environment to Fe2O3 nanorod arrays with delicate energy band positions may be a challenging strategy for efficient PEC water oxidation. It is demonstrated that the designed p-Co3O4/n-Fe2O3 junction exhibits superior photocurrent density, fast water oxidation kinetics, and remarkable charge injection and bulk separation efficiency (eta(inj) and eta(sep)), attributing to the high catalytic behavior of Co3O4 for the oxygen evolution reaction as well as the induced interfacial electric field that facilitates separation and transportation of charge carriers. In addition, a cocatalyst of cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) is introduced, which brings the PEC performance to a high level. The resultant Co-Pi/Co3O4/Ti:Fe2O3 photoanode shows a photocurrent density of 2.7 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE (V vs reversible hydrogen electrode), 125% higher than that of the Ti:Fe2O3 photoanode. The optimized eta(inj) and eta(sep) of 91.6 and 23.0% at 1.23 V-RHE are achieved on Co-Pi/Co3O4/Ti:Fe2O3, respectively, corresponding to the 70 and 43% improvements compared with those of Ti:Fe2O3. Furthermore, Co-Pi/Co3O4/Ti:Fe2O3 shows a low onset potential of 0.64 V-RHE and long-time PEC stability.									149	11	0	0	10	0	149			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000461676300001

Fruit stored in 90 kPa O-2 + 10 kPa CO2 controlled the microorganism growth better than in 70 kPa O-2 + 20 kPa CO2 until the end of storage (18 and 15 d, respectively). Both atmospheres were better than air that only controlled microorganisms for 8 d. Vitamin C retention of samples stored in air was close to 40 % at 8 d, being equal to those registered for the enriched O-2 and CO2 atmospheres samples, but in the double of time. The retention of the total phenolic compounds of blackberries treated with 70 kPa O-2 + 20 kPa CO2 experienced a transient increase (around 10 %) on 1 d and then decreased with time, being 90 % at the end of storage (15 d). The antioxidant capacity of fruit stored under air and O-2- and CO2-enriched atmospheres generally accompanied the evolution of phytochemicals during storage. The refrigerated storage of blackberries in 70 kPa O-2 + 20 kPa CO2 is recommended based on longer maintenance of fruit quality (compared to fruit stored in air), synthesis of phenolic compounds and the increase in the antioxidant capacity, which offers fruit with enhanced bioactivity. The changes in the blackberry quality attributes and in the antioxidant capacity were better fitted with first order kinetic, and the changes in the phenolic compounds were adequately fitted with a consecutive reaction mechanism kinetic model. Meanwhile, the microbiological evolution was satisfactorily evaluated by the Baranyi-Roberts model.									7	0	0	0	3	0	7			0925-5214	1873-2356		WOS:000528880200011

Most of the plasma treatment targets are living tissues and cells immersed in liquids (such as blood or culture media). Reactive species generated by plasma in the gas phase are transported into the liquid and possibly converted to different types of reactive species, so that they can affect tissues or cells. In this paper, we presented a numerical investigation of the interaction between the plasma and the cells immersed in the culture media. The space and time evolution of dissolved reactive species [reactive oxygen species (O-2(-), OH, H2O2, HO2, and O-3) and reactive nitrogen species (O2NO-, NO, NO2-, NO3-, and O2NOH)] are studied by the mass balance model in liquid. The reaction mechanism and the effective transportation range of dissolved reactive species are analyzed. The pH of the liquid has significant effects on the concentration of O-2(-), HO2, O2NO-, and O2NOH in the culture media. The increasing concentration and the higher permittivity through the cell membrane of HO2 and O2NOH at acidic pH are consistent with higher bacterial inactivation efficiency of plasma treatment in acidic pH environment. The cellular and the subcellular concentration of HO2, O2NO-, and O2NOH are studied by the conservation equations in a spherically symmetric concentration field. The plasma treatment increased the cellular concentration of O2NO- over ten times. The HO2 generated by plasma aqueous species was the only way for superoxide to penetrate cell membrane and damage cytosolic fumarase B. The cellular plasma reactive species are also sensitive to the pH of culture media.					1st Sino-German Symposium on Atmospheric Pressure Gas Discharges and Plasma Applications1st Sino-German Symposium on Atmospheric Pressure Gas Discharges and Plasma Applications	OCT 11-17, 2015OCT 11-17, 2015	German Res Fdn, Sino german Ctr; Nat Sci Fdn ChinaGerman Res Fdn, Sino german Ctr; Nat Sci Fdn China	Sino German Sci Ctr, Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINASino German Sci Ctr, Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	20	0	0	0	5	0	20			0093-3813	1939-9375		WOS:000388793800023		
J	Yang, Qian; Chen, Chengcheng; Zhang, Qiaoyu; Zhang, Zhengguo; Fang, Xiaoming				Fang, Xiaoming/E-4865-2010				Molecular engineering of supramolecular precursor to modulate g-C3N4 for boosting photocatalytic hydrogen evolution								CARBON				164				337	348		10.1016/j.carbon.2020.04.015				AUG 30 2020	2020	Herein, a novel strategy was explored to enhance the photocatalytic activity of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4, GCN) by modulating its molecular structure, which involved modifying supramolecular precursor by molecular engineering, followed by pyrolysis. Specifically, 1-amino-2-propanol (monoisopropanolamine, MIPA), a substance that carries both -NH2 and -OH, was introduced into the system of hydrothermally treating dicyandiamide (DCDA). The precursors obtained at the MIPA volume concentration of more than 0.5% display hexagonal prisms, and then transform into the ethyl grafted GCN with a tubular-like morphology, abundant pores and enlarged specific surface area. Besides the intrinsic band absorption, the obtained GCN exhibit an enhanced visible light absorption in the region between 450 and 560 nm, owing to the existence of a midgap state related to the ethyl grafting. A much reduction in charge recombination is observed for the ethyl-grafted GCN, originated from its spatial separation between LUMO and HOMO. Consequently, the hydrogen evolution rate of the GCN sample, obtained at the optimal concentration of MIPA, is 13.84 mmol/h/g (AQE = 18.25% at 420 nm), about 30.1 times higher than that of the bulk C3N4 (BCN) under visible light (lambda > 420) irradiation. This work sheds light on modulating GCN by molecular engineering of supramolecular precursors. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, realizing high-performance hematite photoanodes via an environmentally-friendly route remains a great challenge. In this work, we employed a novel approach to prepare mesoscopic hematite photoelectrodes with remarkable performance for water oxidation. Hydrothermally-synthesized maghemite nanoparticles of high crystallinity with a mean particle size of 3.3 nm were deposited onto fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) transparent conducting glass substrates, followed by heat treatment to convert them into a homogeneous mesoporous hematite layer. A hematite photoanode with a thickness of 220 nm, delivered a maximum photocurrent density of 1.8 mA cm(-2) for water oxidation to oxygen at 1.23 V-RHE under simulated AM 1.5 irradiation. Upon treating the surface of the hematite photoelectrode with Co(II) cations the photocurrent density nearly doubled at the same potential to 3.32 mA cm(-2) placing our new photoelectrode among the best hematite-based photocatalysts for visible light induced water splitting. Further photoelectrochemical analysis provided insights into the factors boosting the performance of the hematite photoanode. (C) 2022 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS").

The catalyst formed in-situ by electrochemically de-lithiating this metal oxide embedded in a high surface area carbon matrix behaved as a bifunctional catalyst for O-2 reduction reaction (ORR) and O-2 evolution reaction (OER) in a non-aqueous Li-O-2 cell. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) in both half and full cells revealed enhanced OER and ORR catalytic activity by: i-) displaying a more positive potential shift during ORR, ii-) stabilizing the initial ORR product LiO2, and iii-) showing an additional potential step in the oxidation of the ORR products. In the CV of catalyzed cells, a reduction peak appeared before the main peroxide (O-2(2-)) formation peak suggesting that the catalyst stabilizes the superoxide (O-2(-)) formed prior to the formation of peroxide. Evidence for LiO2 as the initial discharge product was obtained from both the Raman spectrum and X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Li-air cell cathodes after galvanostatic discharge to 2 V. Surface features for the discharged cathodes obtained from Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) unveiled dissimilar morphologies for the discharge products from catalyzed and uncatalyzed cells, originating from different nucleation mechanisms. The catalyzed cells exhibited longer cycle life than uncatalyzed cells under similar cycling conditions. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society.

J	Vinyard, David J.; Brudvig, Gary W.					Vinyard, David/0000-0002-8058-5998			Insights into Substrate Binding to the Oxygen-Evolving Complex of Photosystem II from Ammonia Inhibition Studies								BIOCHEMISTRY				54	2			622	628		10.1021/bi5014134				JAN 20 2015	2015	Water oxidation in Photosystem II occurs at the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC), which cycles through distinct intermediates, S-0-S-4. The inhibitor ammonia selectively binds to the S-2 state at an unresolved site that is not competitive with substrate water. By monitoring the yields of flash-induced oxygen production, we show that ammonia decreases the net efficiency of OEC turnover and slows the decay kinetics of S-2 to S-1. The temperature dependence of biphasic S-2 decay kinetics provides activation energies that do not vary in control and ammonia conditions. We interpret our data in the broader context of previous studies by introducing a kinetic model for both the formation and decay of ammonia-bound S-2. The model predicts ammonia binds to S-2 rapidly (t(1/2) = 1 ms) with a large equilibrium constant. This finding implies that ammonia decreases the reduction potential of S-2 by at least 2.7 kcal mol(-1) (>120 mV), which is not consistent with ammonia substitution of a terminal water ligand of Mn(IV). Instead, these data support the proposal that ammonia binds as a bridging ligand between two Mn atoms. Implications for the mechanism of O-O bond formation are discussed.									20	0	0	0	10	0	20			0006-2960			WOS:000348333300050	25531753

The main challenge is to ensure that photogenerated holes efficiently oxidize water, which generally requires modification of the photoanode with an oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) to increase the photocurrent and reduce the onset potential(3). However, because excess OEC material can hinder light absorption and decrease photoanode performance(4), its deposition needs to be carefully controlled-yet it is unclear which semiconductor surface sites give optimal improvement if targeted for OEC deposition, and whether sites catalysing water oxidation also contribute to competing charge-carrier recombination with photogenerated electrons(5). Surface heterogeneity(6) exacerbates these uncertainties, especially for nanostructured photoanodes benefiting from small charge-carrier transport distances(1,7,8). Here we use super-resolution imaging(9-13), operated in a charge-carrier-selective manner and with a spatiotemporal resolution of approximately 30 nanometres and 15 milliseconds, to map both the electron-and hole-driven photoelectrocatalytic activities on single titanium oxide nanorods. We then map, with sub-particle resolution (about 390 nanometres), the photocurrent associated with water oxidation, and find that the most active sites for water oxidation are also the most important sites for charge-carrier recombination. Site-selective deposition of an OEC, guided by the activity maps, improves the overall performance of a given nanorod-even though more improvement in photocurrent efficiency correlates with less reduction in onset potential (and vice versa) at the sub-particle level. Moreover, the optimal catalyst deposition sites for photocurrent enhancement are the lower-activity sites, and for onset potential reduction the optimal sites are the sites with more positive onset potential, contrary to what is obtainable under typical deposition conditions. These findings allow us to suggest an activity-based strategy for rationally engineering catalyst-improved photoelectrodes, which should be widely applicable because our measurements can be performed for many different semiconductor and catalyst materials.									231	12	0	0	29	0	235			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000369304500035	26842056

The first Raman spectra of gaseous OClO obtained directly on resonance with the B-2(1)-(2)A(2) electronic transition are reported. Significant scattering intensity is observed for all vibrational degrees of freedom (the symmetric stretch, bend, and asymmetric stretch), demonstrating that structural evolution occurs along all three normal coordinates following photoexcitation. The experimentally measured absorption and resonance Raman intensities are compared to the intensities predicted using both empirical and ab initio models for the optically active (2)A(2) surface. Comparison of the experimental and theoretical absorption spectra demonstrates that the frequencies and intensities of transitions involving the asymmetric stretch are well reproduced by the empirical model characterized by a double-minimum along the asymmetric stretch. However, the ab initio model is also found to reproduce a subset of the experimental intensities. In addition, the extremely large resonance Raman intensity of the asymmetric stretch overtone transition is predicted by both models. The results presented here taken in combination with the model for the (2)A(2) surface in condensed environments suggest that the phase-dependent photochemical reactivity of OClO is due to environment-dependent excited-state structural evolution along the asymmetric stretch coordinate.									30	1	0	0	1	0	30			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000079496600009

Since detailed structural information about this region is unavailable, an MU-based combinatorial mutagenesis approach was used to investigate structure-function relationships in this vital region of D2 in Synechocystis sp, strain PCC 6803. The CD loop coding region contains close to 100 nucleotides, and for effective mutagenesis, it was subdivided into four regions of seven to eight codons. A gain-of-function selection protocol was employed such that all mutants that,were selected contained a functional D2 protein. In this way, conservation patterns of residues along with numbers and types of amino acid substitutions accommodated at each position for each set of mutants would indicate,which residues in the CD loop may play important structural and functional roles. Results of this study have substantiated the importance of residues previously studied by site-directed mutagenesis such as Arg180 and His189 and have identified other previously unremarkable residues in the CD loop (such as Ser166, Phe169, and Ala170) that cannot be replaced by many other residues. In addition, the pliability of the CD loop was further tested using deletion and D1-D2 substitution constructs in M13. This showed that the length of the loop was important to its function, and in two cases, D2 could accommodate homologous sequences from D1, which forms a heterodimer dth D2 in photosystem II, but not the other way around. This study of the CD loop in D2 provides valuable clues regarding the structural and functional requirements of the region.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			0021-9193	1098-5530		WOS:000086499100014	10762245

ZIF-8@GO was obtained by in situ controllable growth of ZIF-8 nanocrystals on both surfaces of graphene oxide (GO) sheets with different contents. Experimental results demonstrate that N-PC@G-0.02 (representing GO amount of 0.02 g in reaction precursors) obtained at 900 degrees C possesses high surface area (1094.3 m(2) g(-1))(,) bimodal-pore structure (micropores and mesopores) and high graphitization degree, exhibiting great potential as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both ORR and OER. Compared to commercial Pt/C catalyst, the N-PC@G-0.02 shows superior electrocatalytic activity with onset and half-wave potentials of 1.01 V and 0.80 V (vs. RHE), respectively, better durability and high resistance to methanol crossover effect toward ORR in alkaline media. Also, the metal-free N-PC@G-0.02 also exhibits high electrocatalytic activity of OER, comparable to commercial RuO2 catalyst. The superior ORR and OER performance could be due to a synergistic effect between ZIF-8 derived porous carbon and graphene with regard to structure and composition of N-PC@G-0.02 with high surface area, porous structure, and suitable N doping level and type, boosting the catalytic active sites, mass transport and electron transfer.

In this study, we prepared N-doped CMs, including hollow carbon spheres (NHCSs) and carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs), to probe the crucial intermediates during PMS activation. The results suggested that the higher efficiency and lower activation energy (13.72 kJ mol(-1)) toward phenol (PN) degradation in an NHCS/PMS system than PMS alone (similar to 24.07 kJ mol(-1)) depended on a typical nonradical reaction. Persistent free radicals (PFRs) with a g factor of 2.0033-2.0045, formed as crucial metastable intermediates on NHCS or N-CNT in the presence of PMS, contribute largely to the organic degradation (similar to 73.4%). Solid evidence suggested that the formation of PFRs relied on the attack of surface-bonded (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot- or peroxides in PMS, among which surface-bonded SO4 center dot- was most thermodynamically favorable based on theoretical calculations. Electron holes within PFRs on NHCSs shifted the Fermi level to the positive energy with the valance band increasing from 1.18 to 1.98 eV, promoting the reactivity toward nucleophilic substances. The degradation intermediates of aromatic compounds (e.g., PN) and electron rearrangement triggered the evolution of PFRs from oxygen-centered to carbon-centered radicals. Moreover, due to the specific electron configuration, graphitic N on NHCS was critical for stabilizing the PFRs. This study provides insightful understanding of the fate of organic contaminants and the structure-activity relationship of reactivity of CMs toward PMS activation.									13	0	0	0	9	0	13			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000671872100082	34139837

According to the electrochemical analysis, although all of the catalysts applied have a similar influence on the V(IV)/V(V) reaction, for the V(II)/V(III) reaction, the sulfenic acid-doped MC shows better catalytic activity with a faster electron transfer rate and narrower peak potential separation. Nyquist plots also support the superiority of the sulfenic acid-doped MC catalyst with a smaller charge transfer resistance. When the catalysts are loaded onto a negative electrode for measuring the performance of VRFB, the VRFB using sulfenic acid-doped MC catalyst shows 6 similar to 10% higher voltage efficiency and 5 similar to 12% higher energy efficiency than other VRFBs. The excellent catalytic activity of the catalyst for the V(II)/V(III) reaction and superior performance of VRFB are due to an increase in the-SOxH bond that acts as an active site for the reaction.

In the present work, three dimension porous CN was prepared in a facile way with high yield by both operation of acid protonation and thermal oxidation. It was found that the CN subjected to firstly acid protonation and secondly heat etching (CN-HT) exhibited almost 29.5 times higher H-2 evolution rate compared to the pristine CN. While the sample subjecting to a reverse operation sequence only had 7.3 times improvement. Compared to the re-calcined sample without protonation, it was found that the introduction of protons (H+) into CN structure before re-calcination significantly enhanced its activity for visible light driven photocatalytic H-2 generation. After full characterizations, the significantly enhanced activity was attributed to the greatly enlarged surface areas, the promoted charge carriers separation and immigration efficiency, the improved reduction potential of photo-induced electrons, as well as the strengthened hydrophilic interface. Our study is expected to provide a new facile approach for tailoring the microstructure of layered materials to achieve improved performance not only for the application of photocatalysis, but also in many other fields.									30	2	0	0	5	0	31			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000443666000030		
J	Wheeler, JC; Hoflich, P; Harkness, RP; Spyromilio, J								Explosion diagnostics of type Ia supernovae from early infrared spectra								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				496	2			908	914		10.1086/305427				APR 1 1998	1998	Models of infrared spectra of Type Ia supernovae around maximum light are presented. The underlying dynamic models are delayed detonation explosions in Chandrasekhar mass carbon/oxygen white dwarfs. In combination with the radiative transport codes employed here, these models provide plausible fits to the optical spectra of "normal" Type Ia supernovae. Two independent radiative transport codes are used, one that assumes LTE and one that computes non-LTE excitations and ionization. The models are compared with the infrared data available in the literature. The independent codes give a reasonable representation of the data and provide physical explanations for their origin independent of the detailed assumptions of the radiative transfer. The infrared gives an especially powerful diagnostic of the dynamic model because it probes different depths at the same epoch within the exploded white dwarf with strongly variable line-blanketing opacity. The velocity of the transition zone between explosive oxygen and carbon burning can be directly determined. The velocity at which the burning to nickel stops can also be probed. These velocities are very sensitive to the explosion physics.									99	1	0	0	0	0	99			0004-637X			WOS:000073048100030

It can also offer a potential for conversion of coal into useful chemicals, allowing more efficient use of coal resources. In this study, a Chinese lignite was extracted by different solvents including CS2, ethanol, and acetone. The composition of the extracts was analyzed by GC-MS method. It was found that the CS2 extracts contained high amounts of aliphatic hydrocarbon. The ethanol and acetone extracts mainly contained oxygen-containing compounds. The effects of reaction temperature and residence time on coal oxidation and composition of extract residues were also investigated. The results showed that lignite was readily oxidized in H2O2 aqueous solution at temperatures above 40 degrees C, and the oxidation behavior (oxidation rate, product distribution and yields) was strongly temperature dependent. Oxidation of extract residues in H2O2 solution was carried out at different temperatures. Water soluble products of oxidation were analyzed using the GC-MS. Aliphatic hydrocarbons were present in all oxidation steps. The relative content of esters in all oxidation steps was also high. The chemical structure changes of coal, the extract residues, and the oxidation residues were studied using FTIR technique. The results indicated that the extract residues had lower intensity of aliphatic hydrogen compared to raw coal. The aromatic carbon concentration remained relatively unchanged when oxidized at temperatures below 30 degrees C, then decreased slightly with increasing the oxidation temperature.

J	Manes, PC; Weaver, PF								Evidence for three distinct hydrogenase activities in Rhodospirillum rubrum								APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY				57	5-6			751	756		10.1007/s00253-001-0828-0				DEC 2001	2001	Inducer, inhibitor, and mutant studies on three hydrogenase activities of Rhodospirillum rubrum indicate that they are mediated by three distinct hydrogenase enzymes. Uptake hydrogenase mediates H-2 uptake to an unknown physiological acceptor or methylene blue and is maximally synthesized during autotrophic growth in light. Formate-linked hydrogenase is synthesized primarily during growth in darkness or when light becomes limiting, and links formate oxidation to H-2 production. Carbon-monoxide-linked hydrogenase is induced whenever CO is present and couples CO oxidation to H-2 evolution. The enzymes can be expressed singly or conjointly depending on growth conditions, and the inhibitor or inducer added. All three hydrogenases can use methyl viologen as the mediator for both the H-2 evolution and H-2 uptake reactions while displaying distinct pH optima, reversibility, and sensitivity to C2H2, gas. Yet, we present evidence that the CO-linked hydrogenase, unlike the uptake hydrogenase, does not link to methylene blue as the electron acceptor. These differences allow conditions to be established to quantitatively assay each hydrogenase independently of the others both in vivo and in vitro.									33	4	0	0	19	0	37			0175-7598			WOS:000172959700025	11778889

However, poor charge transport and slow kinetics for an OER when used alone without a buffer layer have prevented BiVO4 based photoanodes from achieving a high PEC performance that was theoretically expected. Here, we investigate the effects of a SnO2 buffer layer in BiVO4 based photoanodes; in particular, how varying the thickness of the SnO2 layer affects the properties of the materials in the SnO2, the BiVO4 grown on top of the SnO2 and the PEC performance for water oxidation. To our surprise, a simple change of the SnO2 thickness resulted in substantial changes in the intrinsic properties of the BiVO4, including the Bi/V stoichiometry, crystalline phases, grain size, film roughness, and even the band gap, all of which are relevant to the operation of PEC cells. With an optimal SnO2 thickness, much enhanced PEC performances of SnO2/BiVO4 photoanodes were obtained; the photocurrent density of 0.95 and 3.76 mA cm(-2) (measured at 1.23 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under 1 sun illumination) was demonstrated for the water and sulfite oxidation reactions, respectively. Our findings emphasize the importance of tuning the properties of the buffer layer, which subsequently influences the material properties of BiVO4, in achieving high PEC performance of BiVO4-based heterojunctions.									84	6	0	0	3	0	85			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000398889600014

EXAFS, XANES, and P-31 double quantum MAS NMR								CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS				15	25			4709	4716		10.1021/cm0310061				DEC 16 2003	2003	This paper reports a structural study of the effect of TiO2 substitution for Bi2O3 in xNa(2)O- XP2O5-yBi(2)O(3)-zTiO(2) glasses, which were formulated in order to keep a constant average polymerization of the phosphate network. XANES and EXAFS analyses have indicated that the bismuth coordination sphere is similar to that described in other phosphate glasses [Daviero S.; Montagne L.; Palavit G.; Mairesse G.; Belin S.; Briois V. J. Phys. Chem. Solids 2003, 64 (2), 253], and that the titanium coordination sphere is asymmetric, but remains octahedral whatever the substitution degree. P-31 double-quantum filtered MAS NMR shows that the Q(2) fraction increases with the titanium content in the glasses, thus revealing a repolymerization of the phosphate network. The consideration of charges on oxygens (in terms of valence units) leads to the conclusion that titanium octahedra are coordinated to both Q(1) and Q(2) sites. The excess charge on these oxygens is compensated by Na+ removed from Q(1) sites, which explains the observed repolymerization of the phosphate network. The evolution of glass properties is discussed within the context of this structural model. The increase of glass-transition temperature with titanium substitution for bismuth is due to the repolymerization of the phosphate network. The increase of electrical conductivity with titanium content is attributed to an increase of sodium mobility when it is involved in charge compensation of Ti4+ octahedra.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000187250800004

Moreover, porous architectures are highly desirable for active material embedded CNFs. Despite recent progress, controllable synthesis of porous CNFs with favorable mechanical properties is still challenging. Herein, we present a general and novel approach to prepare porous and channel-rich CNFs on a large scale through a free-surface electrospinning technique and subsequent carbonization of polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/cellulose acetate (CA) nanofibers. The resultant free-standing and flexible PAN/CA CNFs (CACNFs) possess abundant porous and channel-rich structures, which can be easily controlled by adjusting the weight ratio of PAN and CA. Based on the porous CACNFs, binder-free Fe3C embedded Fe/N doped CACNF films are successfully prepared. Combining the porous channel-rich structures and the high electrical conductivity of the carbon fibers, abundant accessible active sites and fast mass transport pathways are generated in the carbon fibers, leading to favorable catalytic activity and superior stability for ORR (half-wave potential 12 mV more positive than that of Pt/C) and HER (overpotential 440 mV@80 mV cm(-2) and more than 100 000 s catalytic stability) in alkaline medium, demonstrating their promising potential for application in fuel cells, metal-air batteries and water splitting devices.									57	4	0	0	1	0	58			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000399390300030

A general formula, which can be easily extended to any space dimension, is obtained. When particular nucleation functions and the cluster growth law are considered the kinetics of the perimeter can be explicitly calculated and moreover, it can be expressed as a function of the covered surface. Experimental data on the efficiency of a Cu/CuOx model catalyst, towards imide formation, have been satisfactorily described by the model. Moreover, the growth of Ag on a GaAs(110) surface studied via photoelectron spectroscopy has been qualitatively explained by the proposed model. In the model case of cylindrical clusters the knowledge of the evolution of the total perimeter allows the entire area of the film to be evaluated.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			0039-6028			WOS:A1996UF92100009

The micro- and/or nanoscale characteristics of the components and their interfaces often control critical processes of the device, such as charge-carrier generation, electron and ion transport, surface potentials, and electrocatalysis. Understanding the spatial properties and structure-property relationships of these components can provide insight into designing scalable and efficient solar fuel components and systems. These processes can be probed ex situ or in situ with nanometer-scale spatial resolution using emerging scanning-probe techniques based on atomic force microscopy (AFM). In this Perspective, we summarize recent developments of AFM-based techniques relevant to solar fuel research. We review recent progress in AFM for (1) steady-state and dynamic light-induced surface photovoltage measurements; (2) nanoelectrical conductive measurements to resolve charge-carrier heterogeneity and junction energetics; (3) operando investigations of morphological changes, as well as surface electrochemical potentials, currents, and photovoltages in liquids. Opportunities for research include: (1) control of ambient conditions for performing AFM measurements; (2) in situ visualization of corrosion and morphological evolution of electrodes; (3) operando AFM techniques to allow nanoscale mapping of local catalytic activities and photo-induced currents and potentials.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			0021-9606	1089-7690		WOS:000551929000001	32668946

Results indicated that the bilayer coating can efficiently prevent the oxidation of C/SiC composites in ambient air at 1773 K for more than 100 h with slight weight loss rate of 8.12 x 10(-5) g cm (2)h(-1) and retained compression strength of 96.78%. Microstructure characterization revealed that the gradual densification of Yb2Si2O7 outer coating exposed to 1773 K reduced the oxygen diffusion pathes within the Yb2Si2O7/SiC bilayer coating, therefore, the weight loss rate of specimens decreased as oxidation proceeded. The oxidation activation energy of bilayer coating coated C/SiC specimen was 107.73 kJ/mol during long time oxidation within the temperature range from 1573 K to 1773 K. Based on the microstructure analysis and oxidation behavior of the specimens with different exposure time of oxidation, the oxygen diffusion rate in the bilayer coating was the controlling link during the long time oxidation course.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000497245400042

Herein, Cu3N nanocrystals (similar to 15 nm) have been first used as a cocatalyst coupled with CdS for efficient photocatalytic H-2 evolution with a rate of similar to 4512 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), achieving a dramatic improvement of 851-fold compared to bare CdS. Mechanistic studies revealed that the appropriate d-band center of Cu3N (-1.875 eV) with promoted photogenerated charge carrier kinetics induced its intrinsic activity, as a result of the balance between the adsorption and desorption of H species.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000589418400009

Finding cheap and abundant catalysts is critical to the large-scale implementation of the technology. Two-dimensional metal dichalcogenides nanostructures have attracted increasing attention because of their catalytic performances in water electrolysis. In this work, we systematically investigate the hydrogen evolution reduction of metal dichalcogenides monolayers based on density-functional-theory calculations. We find that metal disulfide monolayers show better catalytic performance on hydrogen production than other metal dichalcogenides. We show that their hydrogen evolution reduction strongly depends on the hydrogen coverage and the catalytic performance reduces with the increment of coverage because of hydrogenation-induced lower conductivity. We further show that the catalytic performance of vanadium disulfide monolayer is comparable to that of Pt at lower hydrogen coverage and the performance at higher coverage can be improved by hybridizing with conducting nanomaterials to enhance conductivity. These metal disulfide monolayers with lower overpotentials may apply to water electrolysis for hydrogen production.									125	2	0	0	5	0	126			2045-2322			WOS:000337891300001	24967679

Two types of catalysts are investigated: wet chemical reduction of Ru3+ on pre-formed cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanoparticles results in ruthenium-cobalt phosphide side-by-side structures (Ru/CoP); while phosphorizing chemically reduced RuCo alloy leads to the formation of hybrid ruthenium cobalt phosphide (RuCoP) clusters. Compared to pristine Ru clusters, both Ru/CoP and RuCoP show significantly improved HER performance in both acidic and alkaline solutions. In particular, the hybrid RuCoP clusters demonstrate a considerably low overpotential ((10)) of 11 mV at -10 mA cm(-2) and a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 10.95 s(-1) at = 100 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4. Even in 1.0 M KOH the excellent HER activity of the RuCoP clusters remains, with a very low (10) of 23 mV and exceptionally high TOF value of 7.26 s(-1) at = 100 mV. Moreover, the RuCoP catalysts can sustain galvanostatic electrolysis in both acidic and alkaline solutions at -10 mA cm(-2) for 150 h with little degradation, showing better catalytic stability than the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalysts. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the RuCoP hybrid exhibits a hydrogen adsorption energy very close to that of Pt and water and -OH adsorption energies distinct from pristine Ru, which reasonably explain the experimentally observed excellent HER activities and highlight the importance of synergistic coupling with cobalt phosphide to boost the HER performance of ruthenium.									251	12	0	0	19	0	253			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000438392400017

Lava whole- rock geochemistry therefore reflects mixing between these crystals and melt and no longer represents melt compositions. As an alternative to using whole-rock analyses, mineral chemistry is used to determine processes occurring during early stages of magma evolution.Primitive magmas at Egmont volcano were hydrous high-magnesian basalts with original f(O2) 2.5-3 log units above FMQ. By the time of eruption this had fallen to 0.8-1.0 log units above FMQ. Early fractionation of olivine (Fo(87)) and chromite (Cr# 0.7-0.8 and Fe3+# 0.24-0.31), and later olivine + clinopyroxene + titanomagnetite drove the evolution of the magma to a high-alumina basalt composition. At the base of the crust these evolved magmas entered the amphibole stability field and reaction between both anhydrous mafic cumulates and wall rocks crystallised amphibole, buffering the melt composition to basaltic andesite. Tapping of these melts to higher levels took them out of the amphibole stability field, resulting in decompressive melting of amphibole phenocrysts and incongruent melting of amphibole in lower to mid-crustal wall rocks in contact with the melt. K2O-rich liquids from incongruent melting were a major source of potassium in the Egmont high-K andesites.Some plagioclase fractionation occurred in higher-level magma chambers but melt segregation was also an important process. H2O-saturated melts fractionated amphibole as the amphibole stability field was again intersected and these melts evolved along a calc-alkaline trend to dacite. In contrast drier melts did not fractionate amphibole and evolved only to andesites. As most of the K2O present is in the groundmass of the lavas, that is, in the liquid phase, the melts formed bl-the highest degree of melt extraction are the most potassic and these are the melts which tend to evolve to dacite.									54	1	0	0	0	0	55			0377-0273			WOS:A1996VZ61500007

Two size classes in each of three taxa (Palaemonetes pugio, Penaeus spp. and Panulirus argus) were examined that together encompassed a 27,000-fold range in mean body mass. In all species, muscle fiber size increased with body mass and ranged in diameter from 70 +/- 1.5 to 210 +/- 8.8 mu m. Thus, intracellular diffusive path lengths for O-2 and HEP molecules were greater in larger animals. The body mass scaling exponent, b, for post-tail flipping (V) over dot(O2) (b=-0.21) was not similar to that for the initial rate of AP resynthesis (b=-0.12), which in turn was different from that of CS activity (b=0.09). We developed a mathematical reaction-diffusion model that allowed an examination of the influence of O-2 and HEP diffusion on the observed rate of aerobic flux in muscle. These analyses revealed that diffusion limitation was minimal under most conditions, suggesting that diffusion might act on the evolution of fiber design but usually does not directly limit aerobic flux. However, both within and between species, fibers were more diffusion limited as they grew larger, particularly when hemolymph P-O2 was low, which might explain some of the divergence in the scaling exponents of muscle aerobic capacity and muscle aerobic flux.									34	0	0	0	31	0	34			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000259866400005	18840655

The radiation induces an imbalance between the energy absorbed through the photophysical process of photosystem (PS) II and the energy consumed for carbon assimilation. Decline in the primary photochemistry of PS II induced by UV-B in the background of relatively stable P-n has been implicated in the creation of the energy imbalance. The radiation induced damage of PS II hinders the flow of electron from Q(A) to Q(B) resulting in a loss in the redox homeostasis between the Q(A) to Q(B) leading to an accumulation of Q(A)(-) The accumulation of Q(A)(-) generates an excitation pressure that diminishes the PS II-mediated O-2 evolution, maximal photochemical potential (F-v/F-m) and PS II quantum yield (Phi(PS) (II)). While UV-B radiation inactivates the carotenoid-mediated protective mechanisms, the accumulation of flavonoids seems to have a small role in protecting the photosynthetic apparatus from UV-B onslaught. The failure of protective mechanisms makes PS II further vulnerable to the radiation and facilitates the accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA) indicating the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism in UV-B-induced damage of photosynthetic apparatus of clusterbean cotyledons.

These materials have attracted vast research interest due to their unique properties originating from ultrathin thickness, highly accessible active sites, and versatile structures. With many common features, MOFs and COFs also have distinct differences, both in synthetic and application aspects, as their building components are different. This review mainly focuses on the recent advances in the synthetic approaches of 2D MOFs and COFs and their applications in energy conversion reactions and storage devices. First, we discuss various strategies recently developed for the preparation of 2D MOFs and COFs by using self-assembly, template-directed method, surfactant-directed method, solid-supported growth, and decomposition, and the different considerations needed for desired 2D MOFs and COFs are compared. Secondly, energy-related applications of 2D MOFs and COFs are summarized with discussion on the structure-reactivity relationships. Finally, we give the insights into the challenges and outlook on the future research direction for 2D MOFs and COFs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

It is therefore crucial to have a surface level understanding of the adsorption of the key species in a reaction in order to design active and selective catalysts. Here, we study the adsorption of guaiacol on Fe (110) and Pd (111) using dispersion-corrected density functional theory calculations as both of these metals are of interest as hydrodeoxygenation catalysts for the conversion of bio-oils to useable biofuels. Both vertical (via the oxygen functional groups) and horizontal (via the aromatic ring) adsorption configurations were examined and the resulting adsorption and molecular distortion energies showed that the vertical sites were only physisorbed while the horizontal sites were chemisorbed on both metal surfaces. A comparison of guaiacol's horizontal adsorption on Fe (110) and Pd (111) showed that guaiacol had a stronger adsorption on Pd (111) while the Fe (110) surface distorted the C-O bonds to a greater degree. Electronic analyses on the horizontal systems showed that the greater adsorption strength for guaiacol on Pd (111) was likely due to the greater charge transfer between the aromatic ring and the surface Pd atoms. Additionally, the greater distortion of the C-O bonds in adsorbed guaiacol on Fe (110) is likely due to the greater degree of interaction between the oxygen and surface Fe atoms. Overall, our results show that the Fe (110) surface has a greater degree of interaction with the functional groups and the Pd (111) surface has a greater degree of interaction with the aromatic ring.

In this context, Co3O4 nanoparticles conformally coated on a light weight, 3D and highly conducting carbon cloth are fabricated using an easily synthesized cobalt hexadecylthiolate complex as ink. This method is especially useful for large-scale production as the complex is synthesized in large quantities and coated on 3D substrates by a simple dip-coating method. The optimum loading of the catalyst is achieved through a layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of a cobalt hexadecylthiolate complex via repeated dip coating of the carbon cloth electrode in the solution. The Co3O4/CC undergoes electrochemical oxidation and converts to CoOOH as an active species and acts as a highly efficient electrocatalyst with optimized loading. The Co3O4-16/CC with 16 times dip coating exhibits remarkable stability over 24 h with an overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 77.06 mV dec(-1). The electrocatalytic activity of Co3O4-16/CC prepared by LbL coating is better than conventional Co3O4 and comparable to IrO2 and RuO2 electrocatalysts with the future possibility of commercial-scale production at lower cost.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000483721900004

POST-MERGER DETONATIONS								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				788	1					75	10.1088/0004-637X/788/1/75				JUN 10 2014	2014	Merging carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs are a promising progenitor system for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), but the underlying physics and timing of the detonation are still debated. If an explosion occurs after the secondary star is fully disrupted, the exploding primary will expand into a dense CO medium that may still have a disk-like structure. This interaction will decelerate and distort the ejecta. Here we carry out multidimensional simulations of "tamped" SN Ia models, using both particle and grid-based codes to study the merger and explosion dynamics and a radiative transfer code to calculate synthetic spectra and light curves. We find that post-merger explosions exhibit an hourglass-shaped asymmetry, leading to strong variations in the light curves with viewing angle. The two most important factors affecting the outcome are the scale height of the disk, which depends sensitively on the binary mass ratio, and the total Ni-56 yield, which is governed by the central density of the remnant core. The synthetic broadband light curves rise and decline very slowly, and the spectra generally look peculiar, with weak features from intermediate mass elements but relatively strong carbon absorption. We also consider the effects of the viscous evolution of the remnant and show that a longer time delay between merger and explosion probably leads to larger Ni-56 yields and more symmetrical remnants. We discuss the relevance of this class of aspherical "tamped" SN Ia for explaining the class of "super-Chandrasekhar" SN Ia.									40	1	0	0	0	0	40			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000337095200075

This Fe-g-C3N4 catalyzed rhodamine B degradation in the presence of H2O2 accompanied with visible light irradiation. transmission electron microscopy(TEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), FT-IR, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and photoluminescence fluorescent spectrometer (PL) characterization analysis methods were adopted to evaluate the physicochemical property of samples. It can be observed that the Fe-g-C3N4 exhibited excellent photocatalytic Fenton-like activity at a wide pH range of 3-9, with rhodamine B(RhB) degradation efficiency up to 95.5% after irradiation for 45 min in the presence of 1.0 mM H2O2. Its high activity was ascribed to the formation of Fe-N ligands in the triazine rings that accelerated electron movement driving the Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox cycle, and inhibited photo-generated electron hole re-combinations for continuous generation of reactive oxygen species by reactions between Fe(II) and H2O2. The main active oxygen species were hydroxyl radicals, followed by superoxide radicals and hole electrons. This produced catalyst of Fe-g-C3N4 shows excellent reusability and stability, and can be a promising candidate for decontamination of wastewater.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4				2079-4991		WOS:000539577200079	32260229

As a potential alternative to the Haber-Bosch process, the electrochemical reduction of N-2 to NH3 is attractive owing to its renewability and flexibility, as well as its sustainability for producing and storing value-added chemicals from the abundant feedstock of water and nitrogen on earth. However, owing to the kinetically complex and energetically challenging N-2 reduction reaction (NRR) process, NRR electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and high selectivity are rare. In this contribution, as a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that both the NH3 yield and faradaic efficiency (FE) under ambient conditions can be improved by modification of the hematite nanostructure surface. Introducing more oxygen vacancies to the hematite surface renders an improved performance in NRR, which leads to an average NH3 production rate of 0.46 mu g h(-1) cm(-2) and an NH3 FE of 6.04 % at -0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.10 m KOH electrolyte. The durability of the electrochemical system was also investigated. A surprisingly high average NH3 production rate of 1.45 mu g h(-1) cm(-2) and a NH3 FE of 8.28 % were achieved after the first 1 h chronoamperometry test. This is among the highest FEs reported so far for non-precious-metal catalysts that use a polymer-electrolyte-membrane cell and is much higher than the FE of precious-metal catalysts (e.g., Ru/C) under comparable reaction conditions. However, the NH3 yield and the FE dropped to 0.29 mu g h(-1) cm(-2) and 2.74 %, respectively, after 16 h of chronoamperometry tests, which indicates poor durability of the system. Our results demonstrate the important role that the surface states of transition-metal oxides have in promoting electrocatalytic NRR under ambient conditions. This work may spur interest towards the rational design of electrocatalysts as well as electrochemical systems for NRR, with emphasis on the issue of stability.									86	11	0	0	2	0	89			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000452614800032	29907981

The aim of the filters is to isolate the emission of a single species, which allows separate analysis of its expansion. Images obtained without a filter revealed two emissive components in the plume, which expand at different velocities for delay times of up to 1.1 mu s. The dynamics of the first component is similar to that of a spherical shock wave, whereas the second component, smaller than the first, expands at constant velocity. Images obtained through a 520 nm filter show that the luminous intensity distribution and evolution of emissive atomic calcium is almost identical to those of the first component of the total emission and that there is no contribution from this species to the emission from the second component of the plume. The analysis through a 780 nm filter reveals that atomic oxygen partially diffuses into the water atmosphere and that there is a contribution from this species to the emission from the second component. The last species studied here, calcium oxide, was analyzed by means of a 600 nm filter. The images revealed an intensity pattern more complex than those from the atomic species. Calcium oxide also contributes to the emission from the second component. Finally, all the experiments were repeated in a Ne atmosphere.

This superfamily also comprises isoflavone reductase-like (IRL) proteins, which are aSDRs highly homologous to isoflavone reductases from leguminous plants. The molecular function of IRLs in non-leguminous plants and green microalgae has not been identified as yet, but several lines of evidence point at their implication in reactive oxygen species homeostasis. The Chlamydomonas reinhardtii IRL protein IFR1 was identified in a previous study, analyzing the transcriptomic changes occurring during the acclimation to sulfur deprivation and anaerobiosis, a condition that triggers photobiological hydrogen production in this microalgae. Accumulation of the cytosolic IFR1 protein is induced by sulfur limitation as well as by the exposure of C. reinhardtii cells to reactive electrophile species (RES) such as reactive carbonyls. The latter has not been described for IRL proteins before. Over-accumulation of IFR1 in the singlet oxygen response 1 (sor1) mutant together with the presence of an electrophile response element, known to be required for SOR1-dependent gene activation as a response to RES, in the promoter of IFR1, indicate that IFR1 expression is controlled by the SOR1-dependent pathway. An implication of IFR1 into RES homeostasis, is further implied by a knock-down of IFR1, which results in a diminished tolerance toward RES. Intriguingly, IFR1 knock-down has a positive effect on photosystem II (PSII) stability under sulfur-deprived conditions used to trigger photobiological hydrogen production, by reducing PSII-dependent oxygen evolution, in C. reinhardtii. Reduced PSII photoinhibition in IFR1 knock-down strains prolongs the hydrogen production phase resulting in an almost doubled final hydrogen yield compared to the parental strain. Finally, IFR1 knock-down could be successfully used to further increase hydrogen yields of the high hydrogen-producing mutant stm6, demonstrating that IFR1 is a promising target for genetic engineering approaches aiming at an increased hydrogen production capacity of C. reinhardtii cells.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			1664-462X			WOS:000406856400002	28824682

We show that coatings based on Co or Mn porphyrin on glassy carbon electrodes efficiently catalyze oxygen reduction in basic solutions by a main 2e-reduction to produce the H2O2 useful chemical. However, it is possible to convert the process into a 4e-reduction process by cobalt porphyrin-based coatings comprised also of controllable amounts of Mn porphyrin which acts as a H2O2 dismutation agent. Electrodes containing both metalloporphyrins (MnP/CoP =1.2) showed longer term stability during oxygen reduction at a potential of -0.35 V vs. Ag/AgCl in comparison to ones containing only cobalt porphyrin: turnover frequencies of 0.30 and 0.17 s(-1), respectively. The concept of integrating various multi-tasking non noble-based catalysts in electrodeposited graphene derivatives can be exploited for further development of practical devices able to produce chemicals or energy.

In the present study, a new type of HER catalyst was developed where ruthenium ions were embedded into the molecular skeletons of graphitic carbon nitride (C3N4) nanosheets of 2.0 +/- 0.4 nm in thickness by refluxing C3N4 and RuCl3 in water. This took advantage of the strong affinity of ruthenium ions to pyridinic nitrogen of the tri-s-triazine units of C3N4. The formation of C3N4-Ru nanocomposites was confirmed by optical and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic measurements, which suggested charge transfer from the C3N4 scaffold to the ruthenium centers. Significantly, the hybrid materials were readily dispersible in water and exhibited apparent electrocatalytic activity towards HER in acid and their activity increased with the loading of ruthenium metal centers in the C3N4 matrix. Within the present experimental context, the sample saturated with ruthenium ion complexation at a ruthenium to pyridinic nitrogen atomic ratio of ca. 1 : 2 displayed the best performance, with an overpotential of only 140 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 57 mV dec(-1), and a large exchange current density of 0.072 mA cm(-2). The activity was markedly lower when C3N4 was embedded with other metal ions such as Fe3+, Co3+, Ni3+ and Cu2+. This suggests minimal contributions from the C3N4 nanosheets to the HER activity, and the activity was most likely due to the formation of Ru-N moieties where the synergistic interactions between the carbon nitride and ruthenium metal centers facilitated the adsorption of hydrogen. This was strongly supported by results from density functional theory calculations.									105	4	0	0	10	0	107			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000408592900059

Alkaline H-2-oxidation to form water involves reaction between H-adsorbed intermediates and hydroxide anions wherein the nature/source of the latter plays a crucial role. Here, we take a systematic approach to understand why H-2-oxidation kinetics is slower in alkaline media compared to acid. While recently reported models focus on surface-adsorbate bond strength optimization, we herein show that the alkaline H-2-oxidation mechanism is fundamentally different due to a complex interplay between electrocatalysis and electrochemical double-layer structure. A heretofore unknown modern rendition of the double-layer structure is proposed wherein specifically adsorbed (M-OHad) and quasi-specifically adsorbed (M-(Had/updOHq-ad)-O-center dot center dot center dot) reactive hydroxide-species localized in the compact part of the electrochemical double-layer is shown to define H-2-oxidation kinetics on monometallic and bimetallic catalyst surfaces at high pH.									62	5	0	0	3	0	62			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000415302600084

Here, we summarize most of the reported (including this study) quartz trace element data (N = similar to 4,600) generated by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) on various textural types and paragenetic stages of quartz in I-type porphyry-epithermal (Cu-Mo-Au-Ag-Te) and S- and A-type granite-greisen (Sn-W and rare metal) systems in the world. The results show that Li versus Al diagrams, combined with Ti-Ge-As-Sb contents, can be used to decipher the source and evolution of fluids in magmatic-hydrothermal systems. In I-type porphyry-epithermal systems, magmatic quartz has low Li/Al ratios from 0.001 to 0.173 (N = 483) with a mean of 0.039 +/- 0.032. Hydrothermal quartz has progressively higher Li and Al concentrations that are dominated by cooling along fluid pathways. Quartz evolves from Ti rich to Ge rich from early to late stages in porphyry hydrothermal veins and is As and Sb rich in epithermal veins. In S- and A-type granite-greisen systems, magmatic quartz has high Li/Al ratios from 0.007 to 0.502 (N = 604) with a mean of 0.130 +/- 0.063 and from 0.009 to 0.327 (N = 325) with a mean of 0.126 +/- 0.065, respectively. Hydrothermal quartz has progressively lower Li and Al concentrations that are dominated by fluid-rock reactions and cooling along fluid pathways. Quartz evolves with decreasing Ti concentrations from magmatic to hydrothermal stages. Ge is abundant in pegmatite quartz in S-type systems. Variations in pH or precipitation rate along fluid pathways have a small influence on Li/Al ratios. The variation of quartz trace elements with elevation in individual systems suggests that they can be used as a vector to guide exploration in magmatic-hydrothermal systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0361-0128	1554-0774		WOS:000827075300002

The constitutive equations are derived by assuming nearly incompressible material with elastic spherical response and viscoelastic deviatoric response, using Mittag-Leffler relaxation function of fractional derivative type, the main advantage being the minimum material parameters needed to successfully fit experimental data over a broad frequency range. The material is furthermore assumed essentially entropic and thermo-mechanically simple while using a modified William-Landel-Ferry shift function to take into account temperature dependence and physical ageing, with fractional free volume evolution modelled by a nonlinear, fractional differential equation with relaxation time identical to that of the stress response and related to the fractional free volume by Doolittle equation. Physical ageing is a reversible ageing process, including trapping and freeing of polymer chain ends, polymer chain reorganizations and free volume changes. In contrast, chemical ageing is an irreversible process, mainly attributed to oxygen reaction with polymer network either damaging the network by scission or reformation of new polymer links. The chemical ageing is modelled by inner variables that are determined by inner fractional evolution equations. Finally, the model parameters are fitted to measurements results of natural rubber over a broad audible frequency range, and various parameter studies are performed including comparison with results obtained by ordinary, non-fractional ageing evolution differential equations.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0935-1175	1432-0959		WOS:000408062000001

The turnover numbers (TONs) based on the amount of Co for the photocatalytic O-2 evolution with [Co-II(Me(6)tren)(OH2)](2+) (1) and [Co-III(Cp*)(bpy)(OH2)](2+) (2) [Me(6)tren tris(N,N'-dimethylaminoethyl) amine, Cp* = eta(5)-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl] at pH 9.0 reached 420 and 320, respectively. The evolved O-2 yield increased in proportion to concentrations of precatalysts 1 and 2 up to 0.10 mM. However, the O-2 yield dramatically decreased when the concentration of precatalysts 1 and 2 exceeded 0.10 mM. When the concentration of Na2S2O8 was increased from 10 mM to 50 mM, CO2 evolution was observed during the photocatalytic water oxidation. These results indicate that a part of the organic ligands of 1 and 2 were oxidized to evolve CO2 during the photocatalytic reaction. The degradation of complex 2 under photocatalytic conditions and the oxidation of Me6tren ligand of 1 by [Ru(bpy)(3)](3+) were confirmed by H-1 NMR measurements. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments indicate the formation of particles with diameters of around 20 +/- 10 nm and 200 +/- 100 nm during the photocatalytic water oxidation with 1 and 2, respectively. The particle sizes determined by DLS agreed with those of the secondary particles observed by TEM. The XPS measurements of the formed particles suggest that the surface of the particles is covered with cobalt hydroxides, which could be converted to active species containing high-valent cobalt ions during the photocatalytic water oxidation. The recovered nanoparticles produced from 1 act as a robust catalyst for the photocatalytic water oxidation.									200	5	0	0	17	1	201			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000304354900033

Cloud formation in carbonand oxygen-rich environments								Astronomy & Astrophysics				603				A123 (15 pp.)	A123 (15 pp.)		10.1051/0004-6361/201629696				July 2017	2017	Context. Recent observations indicate potentially carbon-rich (C/O> 1) exoplanet atmospheres. Spectral fitting methods for brown dwarfs and exoplanets have invoked the C/O ratio as additional parameter but carbon-rich cloud formation modeling is a challenge for the models applied. The determination of the habitable zone for exoplanets requires the treatment of cloud formation in chemically different regimes. Aims. We aim to model cloud formation processes for carbon-rich exoplanetary atmospheres. Disk models show that carbon-rich or near-carbon-rich niches may emerge and cool carbon planets may trace these particular stages of planetary evolution. Methods. We extended our kinetic cloud formation model by including carbon seed formation and the formation of C[s], TiC[s], SiC[s], KCl[s], and MgS[s] by gas-surface reactions. We solved a system of dust moment equations and element conservation for a prescribed DRIFT-PHOENIX atmosphere structure to study how a cloud structure would change with changing initial C/O0 = 0.43... 10.0. Results. The seed formation efficiency is lower in carbon-rich atmospheres than in oxygen-rich gases because carbon is a very effective growth species. The consequence is that fewer particles make up a cloud if C/O0 > 1. The cloud particles are smaller in size than in an oxygen-rich atmosphere. An increasing initial C/O ratio does not revert this trend because a much greater abundance of condensible gas species exists in a carbon-rich environment. Cloud particles are generally made of a mix of materials: carbon dominates if C/O0 > 1 and silicates dominate if C/O0 < 1. A carbon content of 80-90% carbon is reached only in extreme cases where C/O0 = 3.0 or 10.0. Conclusions. Carbon-rich atmospheres form clouds that are made of particles of height-dependent mixed compositions, sizes and numbers. The remaining gas phase is far less depleted than in an oxygen-rich atmosphere. Typical tracer molecules are HCN and C2H2 in combination with a featureless, smooth continuum due to a carbonaceous cloud cover, unless the cloud particles become crystalline.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0004-6361			INSPEC:18186563

The responses of the photoelectrochemical PEC water-splitting properties as an effect of structural and optical changes of WO3 thin films, as well as the nature of electrolyte solutions, were studied in this work. The WO3 thins films have been obtained by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on silicon (Si(001)) covered with platinum substrates using three different laser wavelengths. As the XRD (X-ray diffraction) and XTEM (cross-section transmission electron microscopy) analysis shows, the formation of highly crystalline monocline WO3 phase is formed for the film deposited at 1064 nm wavelength and poor crystalline phases with a large ordering anisotropy, characteristic of 2D structures for the films deposited at 355 nm and 193 nm wavelengths, respectively. The photogenerated current densities J(ph) depend on the laser wavelength, in both alkaline and acidic electrolyte. The maximum values of the photocurrent density have been obtained for the sample prepared with laser emitting at 355 nm. This behavior can be correlated with the coherent crystallized atomic ordering that appear for long distances (10-15 nm) in the (001) plane of the monoclinic WO3 phase structure films obtained at 355 nm laser wavelength. All the samples show poor current density in dark conditions and they are very stable in both acidic and alkaline solutions. The highest photocurrent density value is obtained in acidic solution for the WO3 thin film prepared by 355 nm laser (29 mA/cm(2) at 1.6 V vs. RHE (1.35 V vs. Ag/AgCl)).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2079-4991		WOS:000610667500001	33418853

We found that the slug Elysia timida induces changes to the photosynthetic light reactions of the chloroplasts it steals from the alga Acetabularia acetabulum. Working with a large continuous laboratory culture of both the slugs (>500 individuals) and their prey algae, we show that the plastoquinone pool of slug chloroplasts remains oxidized, which can suppress reactive oxygen species formation. Slug chloroplasts also rapidly build up a strong proton-motive force upon a dark-to-light transition, which helps them to rapidly switch on photoprotective non-photochemical quenching of excitation energy. Finally, our results suggest that chloroplasts inside E. timida rely on oxygen-dependent electron sinks during rapid changes in light intensity. These photoprotective mechanisms are expected to contribute to the long-term functionality of the chloroplasts inside the slugs.									9	0	0	0	5	0	9			2050-084X			WOS:000592950600001	33077025

Among the various nanocatalysts, noble-metal-based ones (containing Ru, Rh, Ir, Pd, Pt, Ag, and Au) exhibit superior performances in most electrocatalytic reactions for their higher catalytic activity and stability as compared to nonnoble-metal-based ones. Currently, the atomic-scale nanoengineering of noble-metal-based electrocatalysts has been demonstrated to be an efficient and robust approach to address specific problems either in catalytic activity/selectivity or durability in a given electrochemical reaction, through understanding the structure-activity relationship of catalysts at the molecular level. In this review, we summarize the progresses made in noble-metal-based nanocatalysts toward some important electrochemical reactions of small-molecule activation (e.g., O-2, H-2, H2O, CH3OH, CO2, and N-2), which involve three aspects: (1) how to synthesize noble-metal-based electrocatalysts with well-defined nanostructures; (2) how to tune the catalytic performance of electrocatalytic reactions; and (3) how to determine the optimal surface structure of catalysts according to the understanding of the structure-activity relationship. Further, we provide prospects for the sustainable development of this cutting-edge field.									39	2	0	0	2	0	41			2052-1553			WOS:000489333000001

The addition of buffer to CoMP11-Ac in water and KCl leads to an enhancement of the catalytic current of up to 200-fold relative to its value in the absence of a buffer. Two distinct catalytic regimes are identified as a function of the buffer pK(a). In the presence of buffers with pK(a) <= 7.4, a fast catalysis regime limited by diffusion of buffer is reached. The catalytic half-wave potential (E-h) shifts anodically (from -1.42 to -1.26 V vs Ag/AgCl/KCI(1M)) as the buffer pK(a) decreases from 7.4 to 5.6, proposed to result from fast Co(III)-H formation following the catalysis-initiating Co(II/I) reduction. With higher-pK(a) buffers (pK(a) > 7.7), an E-h = -1.42 V, proposed to reflect the Co(II/I) couple, is maintained independent of the buffer pk, consistent with rate-limiting Co(III)-H formation under these conditions. We conclude that the buffer species pK(a) impacts catalytic current and potential and the rate-determining step of the reaction.									16	0	0	0	4	0	16			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000541873600022	32436698

Although the dispersion of platinum (Pt) as single atoms (SAs) has increasingly been used in the design of HER electrocatalysts, it is still controversial if the SAs possess higher reactivity relative to the nanoparticles with identical atom loading. Here, by virtue of computational studies, we find that atomic step-rich Pt clusters and defective graphene (DG)-loaded Pt SAs are beneficial to water dissociation and hydrogen coupling, respectively, predicting that decent activity and high atomic utilization for alkaline HER electrocatalysis will be exhibited on the structure that integrates both Pt SAs and nanoclusters onto the DG matrix (PtSA/NC-DG). We experimentally synthesize the PtSA/NC-DG catalyst for alkaline HER. The optimized PtSA/NC-DG delivers an overpotential of 41 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and mass activity of 5.4 mA mu g(pt)(-1) at the overpotential of 100 mV.

The one-dimensional oxygen vacancy channels within BO4 layers usually lead to high ionic conductivity of brownmillerite oxides, demonstrating great application potential in solid-oxide fuel cells, the oxygen separation membrane, and catalyzers. Here, high quality brownmillerite-SrCoO2.5 films have been epitaxially grown on differently oriented substrates by pulsed laser deposition. The anisotropic structural and physical properties of (110)- and (111)-oriented SrCoO2.5 films were systematically investigated. We found, unlike the out-of-plane (001)-oriented SrCoO2.5 films, the CoO6 and CoO4 planes would alternately stack along one of the [100] and [010] axes for (110)-oriented films and one of the [100], [010], and [001] axes for (111)-oriented films, forming coexisting crystal domains with different orientations. More importantly, the superstructure of these films could be reversibly tuned by alternately applying an electric field along two orthogonal directions, switching between an ordered and a disordered state. Corresponding to structural anisotropy, strong in-plane electronic anisotropy of the (110)-oriented SrCoO2.5 film was revealed, which was also electrically tunable like the superstructure. This work demonstrates the approaches to modify the ionic conduction channels of brownmillerite oxides, opening avenues towards electrically tunable oxygen separation membrane and catalyzers.									10	2	0	0	0	0	10			2475-9953			WOS:000463911200002

In this work, a hybrid catalyst composed of monodispersed Ni2P nanoparticles (NPs) and N, P co-doped porous carbon (NPPC) was synthesized through a facile thermal decomposition and used as an efficient electrocatalyst for the HER in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Series technologies including X-ray diffraction, Raman, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and N-2 sorption are used to characterize the as-synthesized catalysts. The electrochemisty experiments suggested that the as-synthesized Ni2P/NPPC displayed efficient electrocatalytic performance with a low onset overpotential (51 mV), small Tafel slope (74 mV dec(-1)), high exchange current density (0.12 mA cm(-2)), large electrochemical double-layer capacitance (21.97 mF cm(-2)) and high conductivity for the HER. The needed overpotentials are 159 and 184 mV to reach to the current density of 10 and 20 mA cm(-2), respectively. Simultaneously, Ni2P/NPPC also displayed good stability in acid solution. The more defects and active sites on the porous carbon which are offered by the co-doped N and P atoms as well as the synergistic effect between NPPC and Ni2P NPs are contributed to the excellent catalytic performance for HER. The current study suggests that introducing the N, P heteroatoms co-doped carbon materials to the Ni2P-based catalysts could enhance HER electrocatalytic performance efficiently.

The reaction was characterized by various spectroscopic measurements and a kinetic analysis of O-2 evolution. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data indicates the interlayer separation of mica changes upon intercalation of 1. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance (RD) and Mn K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) data suggest that the oxidation state of the di-mu-oxo Mn-2 core is Mn-III-Mn-IV, but it is not intact. In aqueous solution, the reaction of 1 with a large excess CeIV oxidant led to decomposition of 1 to form MnO4- ion without O-2 evolution, most possibly by its disproportionation. However, MnO4- - formation is suppressed by adsorption of 1 on clay. The maximum turnover number for O2 evolution catalyzed by 1 adsorbed on mica and kaolin was 15 and 17, respectively, under the optimum conditions. The catalysis occurs in the interlayer space of mica or on the surface of kaolin, whereas MnO4 - formation occurs in the liquid phase, involving local adsorption equilibria of adsorbed 1 at the interface between the clay surface and the liquid phase. The analysis of O-2 evolution activity showed that the catalysis requires cooperation of two equivalents of 1 adsorbed on clay. The second-order rate constant based on the concentration (mol g(-1)) of 1 per unit weight of clay was 2.7 +/- 0.1 mol(-1) s(-1) g for mica, which is appreciably lower than that for kaolin (23.9 +/- 0.4 mol-1 s-1 g). This difference can be explained by the localized adsorption of 1 on the surface for kaolin. However, the apparent turnover frequency (( k(O2)) (app)/s(-1)) of 1 on mica was 2.2 times greater than on kaolin when the same fractional loading is compared. The higher cation exchange capacity (CEC) of mica statistically affords a shorter distance between the anionic sites to which 1 is attracted electrostatically, making the cooperative interaction between adsorbed molecules of 1 easier than that on kaolin. The higher CEC is important not only for attaining a higher loading but also for the higher catalytic activity of adsorbed 1.									74	1	0	0	14	0	75			1520-6106			WOS:000242045900028	17107151

Herein, we report N, P, S multi-doped Mo2C/C composites exhibiting highly efficient HER performance in acidic solution, which are facilely fabricated via annealing of N, P, S- containing MoOx-polyaniline (MoOx-PANI) hybrid precursors. The optimized N, P, S multi-doped Mo2C/C catalyst with a moderate P dopant level (NPS-Mo2C/C-0.5) exhibits excellent performance with an overpotential of 53 mV to achieve a current density of 20 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 72 mV dec(-1) and good stability in acidic electrolytes. Based on the study of XPS, EPR and P-31 MAS NMR, the excellent electrocatalytic performance could be attributed to the effective electronic configuration modulation of both Mo2C nanorods and the carbon matrix, derived from stronger synergistic N, P, S multi-doping coupling effects. This work provides a promising methodology for the design and fabrication of multi-doped transition metal based electrocatalysts via electronic structure engineering.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2516-0230			WOS:000559380900021	36134296

Herein, the data were addressed the cost effective and significantly effective hydrogen (H-2) production from water over MgO promoted Ni-Si/CNTs photocatalyst under visible light irradiation without using of any sacrificial agents. The catalyst was synthesized by a simple, easily scalable one-pot solid phase reduction reaction of metal oxides embedded on the carbon nanotube. The band gaps of these composites were estimated to be 3.50 -3.58 eV from the onsets of diffuse reflection spectra. It was found that the composite Ni-Si-MgO/CNTs showed a higher H-2 evolution rate in comparison with Ni-Si/MgO under visible light irradiation. With the use of Ni-Si-MgO/CNTs as a photocatalyst, the H-2 evolution is estimated to be 815 mu mol for 1 h, the highest value so far reported among the family of noble-metal-free photocatalyst without the help of sacrificial electron donor under visible irradiation. No significant reduction of H-2 production (715 mu mol h(-1)) was observed even after 3 consecutive runs of photocatalyst indicating the suitability of catalyst. The results represent an important step forward towards the hydrogen production from water owing to its scalability and low fabrication cost. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we report the simple, cost-effective, one step, and surfactant-free synthesis of three-dimensional graphenes (3D-G) nanocomposites with Pt, Pd, Au and Ag and explore their catalytic activity and investigated the dynamics for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) study reveals the uniform incorporation of noble metal on the 3D-G. The 3D-G with Pt composite (Pt/3D-G) has shown significantly enhanced catalytic performance over the commercially available Pt/C for HER, suggesting significant improvements in catalytic performance on the incorporation of 3D-G. The Temperature dependent HER investigation has been performed and the apparent activation energy (E-a(app)) for Pt/3D-G. Pd/3D-G, Au/3D-G, and Ag/3D-G catalysts are obtained as 25.37, 32.36, 16.14, and 24.82 kJ/mol, respectively. E-a(app) of Pt/3D-G and Pd/3D-G are found to decrease with increase in the overpotential, and the E-a(app) of Au/3D-G and Ag/3D-G is found to increase with overpotential. This variation of Eaapp with the applied potential is correlated with the metal-hydrogen bond energy with respect to the potential of zero charges (PZC). The kinetics of HER on catalysts is explained in terms of temperature variation of the Tafel slope. The Tafel slopes of Pt/3D-G and Pd/3D-G are increased with increase in temperature, and for Au/3D-G and Ag/3D-G, the Tafel slopes are decreased with increase in temperature, which suggests the enthalpy driven process for Pt/3D-G and Pd/3D-G and entropy driven process for Au/3D-G and Ag/3D-G.

The structure of the manganese complex is very similar for the two detergent preparations used. Analysis of the e.x.a.f.s. spectra for samples in the S1 and S2 states indicate changes in bond lengths for the shells of oxygen/nitrogen atoms. For the S1 state, oxygen shells at 0.181 and 0.193 nm (1.81 and 1.93 angstrom) were observed and one manganese shell at 0.270 nm (2.70 angstrom). In the S2 state the oxygen bond lengths are longer at 0.184 and 0.200 nm (1.84 and 2.00 angstrom). Additionally a shell of scatterers at 0.37 nm (3.7 angstrom) was observed in both states which could be fitted to models with calcium scatterers at this distance.									72	0	0	0	36	0	72			0264-6021	1470-8728		WOS:A1992JF50200033	1637347

One of the three histidine residues has a covalent link to a tyrosine residue to ensure retention of the tyrosine at the O(2) reduction site. These moieties facilitate a four electron reduction of O(2), and prevent formation of active oxygen species. The combination of a redox-coupled conformational change of an aspartate residue (Asp51) located near the intermembrane surface of the enzyme molecule and the existence of a hydrogen bond network connecting Asp51 to the matrix surface suggest that the proton-pumping process is mediated at Asp51. Mutation analyses using a gene expression system of the Asp51-containing enzyme subunit yield results in support of the proposal that Asp51 plays a critical role in the proton pumping process.

It is still a great challenge to seek efficient visible light photocatalyst to realize overall water splitting. In this work, the tetragonal zircon BiVO4 is prepared by epitaxial growth on FTO substrate and its overall water splitting reaction is studied. Under the influence of epitaxial strain, the conduction band position shifts negatively and beyond H+/H-2 reduction potential (0 V vs NHE), which enables it to possess the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. After loading cocatalysts, the overall water splitting (lambda > 400 nm) is realized (H-2: approximate to 65.7 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), O-2: approximate to 32.6 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)), and the value of solar hydrogen conversion efficiency is 0.012%. The single-particle photoluminescence (PL) spectra and PL decay kinetics tests demonstrate the cocatalysts are beneficial to the separation and transfer of carriers. The new strategy of adjusting the band structure by strain is provided.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2198-3844		WOS:000771342100001	35315250

Herein, systematic density functional theory (DFT) predicts that on representative NiO, the hydroxylation (OH-) and heterointerface coupled with metallic Cu can respectively reduce the energy barrier of water dissociation and facilitate hydrogen spillover. Motivated by theoretical predictions, we subtly designed a delicate strategy to realize the electrochemical OH- modification in KOH with moderate concentration (HOM-NiO) and to channel rapid hydrogen spillover at the heterointerface of HOM-NiO and Cu, ensuring an enhanced HER kinetic. This HOM-NiO/Cu is systematically investigated by in situ XAS and electrochemical simulations, verifying its extraordinary merits for HER including the enhanced water dissociation, alleviated oxophilicity that is advantageous for consecutive adsorptions of water, and accelerated hydrogen spillover, thereby exhibiting superb HER activity with 33 and 310 mV overpotentials at the current densities of 10 and 1000 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, outperforming the Pt/C.

Herein, we report the self-supporting NiFe LDH-MoSx integrated electrode for water oxidation under normal alkaline test condition (1 M KOH at 25 degrees C) and simulated industrial electrolysis conditions (5 M KOH at 65 degrees C). Such optimized electrode exhibits excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with overpotential of 195 and 290 mV at current density of 100 and 400 mA.cm(-2) under normal alkaline test condition. Notably, only overpotential of 156 and 201 mV were required to achieve the current density of 100 and 400 mA center dot cm-2 under simulated industrial electrolysis conditions. No significant degradations were observed after long-term durability tests for both conditions. When using in two-electrode system, the operational voltages of 1.44 and 1.72 V were required to achieve a current density of 10 and 100 mA center dot cm-2 for the overall water splitting test (NiFe LDH-MoSx/INF || 20% Pt/C). Additionally, the operational voltage of employing NiFe LDH-MoSx/INF as both cathode and anode merely require 1.52 V at 50 mA center dot cm-2 at simulated industrial electrolysis conditions. Notably, a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) for anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWEs) using NiFe LDH-MoSx/INF as an anode catalyst exhibited an energy conversion efficiency of 71.8% at current density of 400 mA center dot cm-2 in 1 M KOH at 60 degrees C. Further experimental results reveal that sulfurized substrate not only improved the conductivity of NiFe LDH, but also regulated its electronic configurations and atomic composition, leading to the excellent activity. The easy-obtained and cost-effective integrated electrodes are expected to meet the large-scale application of industrial water electrolysis.

Monoclinic WO3 platelets with a size ranging from 20 to 40 nm and a thickness of 3 nm were obtained after a short reaction time of 10 minutes under microwave irradiation. The films consisted of a porous network of nanoparticles and their photoelectrochemical activity was tested. After cathodic polarization of the photoanodes in the dark which led to a significant increase of 65% of the photocurrent, the films exhibited initially a maximum photocurrent of 2.7 mA cm(-2) at 1 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 3 M H2SO4 under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm(-2)) comparable to the best photocurrents reported for WO3 photoanodes. However oxygen evolution measurements showed that the faradaic efficiency dropped after the cathodic polarization and other products than O-2 might be formed. In comparison to the chemical solution growth of films from molecular precursors, the use of preformed nanoparticles in the form of powders is not only more robust and easier to up-scale, but also offers many opportunities to improve the photoelectrochemical performance by tailoring the nanoparticle size, the shape, and their arrangement on the substrate.									38	0	0	0	1	0	38			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000345531200016

Hydrogen evolu-tion reaction (HER) by electrochemical water splitting is the most reliable and effective way for the sustainable production of pure hydrogen. The design and synthesis of highly active and stable non-noble-metal-based electrocatalysts is the core of the large-scale application of this technology. Herein, peony petal-like CoMnP/NF nanomaterials growing on nickel foam (NF) are prepared via facile hydrothermal and phosphorization methods. The results showed that CoMnP/NF had excellent HER activity in acidic and alkaline media. In 0.5 M H2SO4, CoMnP/NF only needed 66.6 mV overpotential to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), with a Tafel slope of 38.8 mV dec(-1). In addition, a particularly low over -potential of 53.9 mV and Tafel slope of 63 mV dec(-1) are required to achieve the same current density in the 1 M KOH electrolyte. Meanwhile, the electrocatalyst showed good stability after 1000 cyclic voltammetry tests and 12 h I-T tests. In the 1 M KOH electrolyte, the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) achieved with only 1.70 V battery voltage, and the electrocatalyst showed excellent stability. The performance of CoMnP/NF can be attributed to the synergistic effect between Co and Mn atoms and the high electrochemical surface area (ECSA). This study provides a valuable strategy for the synthesis of non-precious metals and high-performance catalytic materials. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, synchrotron radiation photoionization mass spectrometry (SR-PIMS) was utilized to online monitor the evolved gaseous compounds during the tea roasting process. By virtue of "soft" ionization and fast data acquisition characteristics of SR-PIMS, dozens of aroma compounds including alcohols, aldehydes, furans, and nitrogen- and sulfur-containing species were detected and identified in real time. Moreover, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF), the key intermediate of Mallard reactions, was found with high sensitivity. Evolution processes of all the products could be observed via the time- and temperature-resolved profiles in N-2 and the air. Dehydration was found to be the first step during roasting. Oxygen in the air was found to accelerate the formation rate of various stable species and intermediates in the course of the thermal treatment of fresh green tea. The formation mechanisms of evolved compounds such as three sulfur-containing compounds, i.e., dimethyl sulfide, hydrogen sulfide, and methanethiol, could be proposed according to the step-by-step formation process. The time-resolved results were demonstrated to be applicable in the evaluation of different roasting processes by statistical analysis. The optimum tea roasting temperature and duration are proposed to be around 200 degrees C and 1000 s.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1044-0305	1879-1123		WOS:000714641000016	33961425

Here, a selective metal atom in situ growth strategy to construct highly active interface of mixed metal atom with different NbyRhOx species on sp-/sp(2)-cohybridized graphdiyne (NbyRhOx/GDY) is reported. With this innovative idea implemented, experimental results show that the asymmetric electron distribution and the variation of coordination environment of bimetallic species significantly improve the electrocatalytic activity of NbyRhOx/GDY. Optimal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity is achieved at the Nb/Rh ratio of 0.23, exhibiting excellent HER activity with the small overpotentials of 14 and 10 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline and neutral electrolytes. The data show the strong potential for real-system application of such catalysts, which outperform commercial Pt/C (20 wt%). These results shown in this study represent a platform for designing novel catalytic materials by selectively introducing metal atoms on different supports, which can be used as a general method extended to other catalytic systems.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5				2198-3844		WOS:000749306400001	35104059

Semiconductors play a vital role in this approach, absorbing the incident solar photons and converting them into electrons and holes. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurs in the interface of the p-type semiconductor that works as a photocathode in the PEC. Cu-chalcopyrites such as Cu(In, Ga)(Se,S)(2) (CIGS) and CuIn(Se,S)(2) (CIS) present excellent semiconductor characteristics for this purpose, but drawbacks as charge recombination, deficient chemical stability, and slow charge transfer kinetics, demanding improvements like the use of n-type buffer layer, a protective layer, and a cocatalyst material. Concerning the last one, platinum (Pt) is the most efficient and stable material, but the high price due to its scarcity imposes the search for inexpensive and abundant alternative cocatalyst. The present Minireview highlighted the use of metal alloys, transition metal chalcogenides, and inorganic carbon-based nanostructures as efficient alternative cocatalysts for HER in PEC.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000695969300001	34411435

In this study, we report a facile room-temperature synthesis of ultrafine metallic Ir nanoparticles on conductive, proton-intercalated TiO2 nanotube (H-TNT) arrays via galvanic displacement. A series of experiments demonstrate that a controlled transformation of the H-TNT surface microstructure from neat open-top tubes to disordered nanostripe bundles ("nanograss") is highly beneficial for providing an abundance of exposed Ir active sites. Consequently, for nanograss-engineered composites, outstanding HER activity metrics are achieved even at very low Ir(iii) precursor concentrations. An optimum Ir@TNT cathode loaded with 5.7 mu g(Ir) cm(-2) exhibits an overpotential of -63 mV at -100 mA cm(-2) and a mass activity of 34 A mg(Ir)(-1) at -80 mV under acidic conditions, along with excellent catalytic durability and structural integrity. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations reveal that the hydrogen-rich TiO2 surface not only stabilizes the deposited Ir and weakens its H binding strength to a moderate intensity, but also actively takes part in the HER mechanism by refreshing the Ir catalytic sites near the Ir|H-TiO2 interface, thus substantially promoting H-2 generation. The comprehensive characterization combined with theory provides an in-depth understanding of the electrocatalytic behavior of H-TNT supported PGM nanoparticles and demonstrates their high potential as competitive electrocatalyst systems for the HER.									18	1	0	0	3	0	18			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000589418400026

Herein, two-dimension monolayer Ti3C2 MXene sheets were introduced to support PtNi octahedrons (PtNi@Ti3C2 MXene), which optimizes the activity and stability of PtNi nanoparticles (NPs) through interface interactions between PtNi and Ti3C2 MXene. It shows a small overpotential of 36 mV with a Tafel slope of 59 mV dec-1 at 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH. It also exhibits excellent mass activity of 6.31 mA mu gPt-1 at an overpotential of 70 mV, which is -7.1 times that of commercial Pt/C and better than many recent reported Pt-based alkaline HER catalysts. Meanwhile, the PtNi@Ti3C2 MXene gives an increased overpotential of -4 mV while the PtNi gives -25 mV during a long-time continuous CV cycles. A series of characterizations disclose these interfaces could promote the stability by alleviating the Ni atoms dissolution from surficial PtNi through uniformly lattice strain dispersion of PtNi. Simultaneously, they could keep the activity by interfacial electron transfer from PtNi to Ti3C2 MXene demonstrated both by experimental tests (UPS, electrostatic potential and charge density distribution) and DFT calculation. It could decrease the energy barrier of H2O adsorbing and dissociating into hydrogen intermediates, further accelerating the recombination of hydrogen intermediates to H2. Under acidic and neutral medium, the electrocatalyst also exhibits improved HER performance compared to its counterparts. This work provides an interface optimization route for developing highefficiency pH-universal especially alkaline HER electrocatalysts.									23	0	0	0	3	0	23			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000663275100004

Unlike previously reported methods, we demonstrate a confinement effect using a mesoporous template for in situ fabrication of cationic W vacancies in as-prepared ordered mesoporous tungsten phosphide (WP) nano-structures by adjusting the nonstoichiometric ratio of the precursor elements. With a plenty of W vacancies and ordered mesoporosity, the as-prepared catalyst WP-Mesop exhibits better catalytic performance than the catalysts without mesopores and/or vacancies. The WP-Mesop shows an ultralow overpotential of 175 mV in acid and 229 mV in alkaline at 100 mA cm(-2) and stability of 48 h without structural collapse in both acid and alkaline media. Meanwhile, density functional theory calculations further reveal that the activation barrier for HER can be lowered by introducing cationic W vacancies. This strategy can be extended to generate cationic defects in other transition metal phosphides to improve their HER activities.									18	2	0	0	1	0	18			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000537394100033	32356651

Catalyst erosion from the anode substrate is a major cause of DBFC performance degradation. The depression of hydrogen evolution effectively stabilizes DBFC performance. DBFCs using Ni-Pd/C as the anode catalyst and polypyrrole-modified carbon-supported Co(OH)(2) [Co(OH)(2)-PPy/BP] as the cathode catalyst exhibit high performance stability. The performance stability of Co(OH)(2)-PPy/BP is similar to that of commercial Pt/C, although only a small amount of Co remains after operation. The cooperative interaction among Co, N from polypyrrole, and C from the carbon supporter plays a very important role in the performance stability of a DBFC cathode. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The hybridization of N-doped graphene and a cost-effective metal is expected to be a promising approach for enhanced HER performance but faces bottlenecks in controllable fabrication. Herein, a silica medium-assisted method is developed for the high-efficient synthesis of single-layer N-doped graphene encapsulating nickel nanoparticles (Ni@SNG), where silica nanosheets molecule sieves tactfully assist the self-limiting growth of single-layer graphene over Ni nano-particles by depressing the diffusion of gaseous carbon radical reactants. The Ni@SNG sample synthesized at 800 degrees C shows excellent activity for HER in alkaline medium with a low overpotential of 99.8 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is close to that of the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst. Significantly, the Ni@SNG catalyst is also developed as a binder-free electrode in magnetic field, exhibiting much improved performance than the common Nafion binder-based electrode. Therefore, the magnetism adsorption technique will be a greatly promising approach to overcome the high electron resistance and poor adhesive stability of polymer binder-based electrodes in practical applications.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000614062400078	33440933

In situ measurements allowed showing the different behavior of the two samples, both in the d-d and Ligand to Metal Charge Transfer regions, confirming a strong effect of the lattice composition to determine the copper environment and its reactivity. One of the two sample (Si/Al = 15 and Cu/Al = 0.5) was further investigated, in order to clarify the nature of the Cu-oxo species, formed along activation in oxygen. To shed light on this point, in situ measurements starting from a reduced form of the sample, obtained by activation in inert atmosphere at high temperature, were also considered. Additional suggestions on the nature of these species were obtained by resonant Raman measurements conducted in controlled atmosphere.									40	0	0	0	5	1	40			0926-860X	1873-3875		WOS:000467512700001

A specially developed PS II model (Belyaeva et al., 2008, 2011a) allowed the determination of ET steps that occur in a hierarchically ordered time scale from nanoseconds to several seconds. Our study demonstrates that our SFITFY data is consistent with the concept of the reduction of P680(+center dot) by Y-Z in both leaves and algae (studied on spinach leaves and cells of Chlorella pyrenoidosa Chick). The multiphasic P680. reduction kinetics by Y-Z in PS II core complexes with high oxygen evolution capacity was seen in both algae and leaves. Model simulation to fit SFITFY curves for dark adapted species used here gives the rate constants to verify nanosecond kinetic stages of P680(+center dot). reduction by Y-Z in the redox state S-1 of the water oxidizing complex (WOC) shown in Kuhn et al. (2004). Then a sequence of relaxation steps in the redox state SI, outlined by Renger (2012), occurs in both algae and leaves as a similar non-adiabatic ET reactions. Coupled PT is discussed briefly to understand a rearrangement of hydrogen bond protons in the protein matrix of the WOC (Umena et al., 2011). On the other hand, present studies showed a slower reoxidation of reduced Q(A) by Q(B) in algal cells as compared with that in a leaf that might be regarded as a consequence of differences of spatial domains at the Q(B)-site in leaves compared to algae. Our comparative study helped to correlate theory with experimental data for molecular photosynthetic mechanisms in thylakoid membranes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The chemistry in circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars: Following the origin of the elements to the origin of life								PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				103	33			12274	12279		10.1073/pnas.0602277103				AUG 15 2006	2006	Mass loss from evolved stars results in the formation of unusual chemical laboratories: circumstellar envelopes. Such envelopes are found around carbon- and oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch stars and red supergiants. As the gaseous material of the envelope flows from the star, the resulting temperature and density gradients create a complex chemical environment involving hot, thermodynamically controlled synthesis, molecule "freeze-out," shock-initiated reactions, and photochemistry governed by radical mechanisms. in the circumstellar envelope of the carbon-rich star IRC+10216, > 50 different chemical compounds have been identified, including such exotic species as C8H, C3S, SiC3, and AlNC. The chemistry here is dominated by molecules containing long carbon chains, silicon, and metals such as magnesium, sodium, and aluminum, which makes it quite distinct from that found in molecular clouds. The molecular composition of the oxygen-rich counterparts is not nearly as well explored, although recent studies of VY Canis Majoris have resulted in the identification of HCO+, SO2, and even NaCl in this object, suggesting chemical complexity here as well. As these envelopes evolve into planetary nebulae with a hot, exposed central star, synthesis of molecular ions becomes important, as indicated by studies of NGC 7027. Numerous species such as HCO+, HCN, and CCH are found in old planetary nebulae such as the Helix. This "survivor" molecular material may be linked to the variety of compounds found recently in diffuse clouds. Organic molecules in dense interstellar clouds may ultimately be traced back to carbon-rich fragments originally formed in circumstellar shells.									218	5	0	0	13	0	218			0027-8424			WOS:000239867500015	16894164

Vacuum plasma spray (VPS) was then used to deposit coatings of this material on a substrate. Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence and X-ray diffraction analysis was used to follow the change in the chemical composition and crystalline structure of the powder upon deposition by VPS. Nanocrystalline Ti-Ru-Fe-O (2-1-1-2) prepared by the ZOZ attritor contains more than 50 wt.% of hexagonal Fe(2)Ti and a smaller amount (<10 wt.%) of a cubic phase. Iron contamination coming from the attrition of the milling tools yields [Fe] similar to38 wt.%, almost twice as much as the nominal composition of the powder. When it is used for VPS, reaction between Fe(2)Ti and Ru results in the formation of several cubic phases with lattice parameters ranging from 2.96 to 3.02 Angstrom. This reflects a change in the Ru content on the 1a (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) site of the cubic lattice. The deposition process also results in the formation of Ti(2)O(3). This phase is present in excess at the surface of the coating but can be efficiently dissolved through etching in an acid solution. The cathodic overpotential for hydrogen evolution of such activated coatings in typical chlorate electrolysis conditions is eta(250) = 550 mV (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The compacted powders were sintered freely in air or in O2 at constant heating rates of 1-10-degrees-C/min up to 1350-degrees-C. The undoped CeO2 started to sinter at almost-equal-to 800-900-degrees-C and reached a maximum density of 0.95 of the theoretical at 1200-degrees-C, after which the density decreased slightly. Isothermal sintering at 1150-degrees-C produced a sample with a relative density of almost-equal-to 0.98 and an average grain size of almost-equal-to 100 nm. The samples sintered above 1200-degrees-C exhibited microcracking. The decrease in density and the microcracking above 1200-degrees-C are attributed to a redox reaction leading to the formation of oxygen vacancies and the evolution Of O2 gas. Doping with Y2O3 produced an increase in the temperature at which measurable sintering commenced and an increase in the sintering rate, compared with the undoped CeO2. Sintered samples of the doped CeO2 showed no microcracks. The CeO2 doped with up to 3 mol % Y2O3 was sintered to almost full density and with a grain size of almost-equal-to 200 nm at 1400-degrees-C.									227	6	1	0	5	1	232			0884-2914			WOS:A1993LJ82400027

With the predesigned nitrogen position and structural features of COP materials, the obtained CCOPTDP-FeNi-SiO2 catalyst affords a remarkable bifunctional performance with a positive half-wave potential (0.89 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode: RHE, superior to the benchmark Pt/C) for ORR activity, and a low overpotential (0.31 V better than the benchmark IrO2) at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER activity in alkaline solution. The potential gap between E-1/2 and E-j=10 reaches 0.650 V, in line with that observed in the current state-of-the-art bifunctional oxygen electrode materials. Moreover, a homemade rechargeable Zn-air flow battery using the CCOPTDP-FeNi-SiO2 catalyst as an air cathode exhibits an almost twofold power density (112.8 vs. 64.8 mW cm(-2)) and a lower charge-discharge voltage gap, compared with a commercialized noble Pt/C + IrO2/C-driven Zn-air flow battery. More importantly, the CCOPTDP-FeNi-SiO2-driven battery maintains a better cycling stability compared to a noble metal-driven battery without performance decay. Accordingly, this work will open up new ways for fabricating practical oxygen electrodes for, but not limited to, metal air based battery applications.									15	1	0	0	2	0	15			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000454327500017	30525168

However, developing a facile and effective approach to enhance the photocatalytic activity for practical applications is still highly challenging. Herein, we report a newly-fabricated perovskite oxide (Pr-0.5(Ba0.5Sr0.5)(0.5)Co0.8Fe0.2O3) decorated with Au ultrafine nanoparticles for photocatalytic water splitting. An exceptionally high hydrogen evolution rate of 1618 mu mol g(-1)h(-1)was achieved (under 2 h illumination) when the Au mass loading was optimized to 9.3 wt%, which is 540 times higher than that of the pristine one. The splendid photocatalytic activity of the sample was attributed to plasmon-excited hot electron injection from Au to Pr-0.5(Ba0.5Sr0.5)(0.5)Co0.8Fe0.2O3(PBSCF) under illumination. The finite-difference time-domain simulations (FDTD) demonstrated that the localized strong electric field formed at the interface between Au and PBSCF under illumination, enables the hot electrons to be energetic and make the injection possible.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000572677500016	32896842

We consider oxide overlayer structures on RuO2(110) surfaces as model catalysts to elucidate the trends and limitations in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) based on thermodynamic analysis. We aim to specify the requirements for CO2RR catalysts to establish adsorbate scaling relations and use these to derive activity volcanoes. Computational results show that the OH* binding free energy is a good descriptor of the thermodynamic limitations and it defines the left leg of the activity volcano for CO2RR. HCOOH* is a key intermediate for products formed through further reduction, for example, methanediol, methanol, and methane. The surfaces that do not bind HCOOH* are selective towards formic acid (HCOOH) production, but hydrogen evolution limits their suitability. We determine the ideal binding free energy for H* and OH* to facilitate selective CO2RR over H-2/CO evolution to be Delta GB[H]>0.5 eV and -0.5 eV < Delta GB[OH] < 0.1 eV. The Re-containing overlayers considered in this work display excellent promise for selectivity, although they are active at a highly reducing potential.									27	1	0	0	2	0	27			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000394571300014	27781396

Performance and microbial consortium structure in simultaneous removal of sulfur and nitrogen compounds under micro-oxygenated condition								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				16	10			5767	5782		10.1007/s13762-018-2132-x				OCT 2019	2019	Effects of COD/SO42- and SO42-/NH4+ ratios on simultaneous removal of sulfate- and ammonium-rich synthetic wastewaters were investigated under micro-oxygenated condition (dissolved oxygen concentration at 0.10-0.15 mg/L). Lactate was served as carbon source to generate COD/SO42- ratios of 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 3.5 and 4.0. The batch experimental results indicated that the highest sulfate (72.1%) and ammonium (62.8%) removal efficiencies could be reached at COD/SO42- ratio of 4.0. The main metabolic products were elemental sulfur (0.63 g S-0/g SO42--S-added) and nitrogen gas (0.57 g N-2/g NH4+-N-added). Subsequently, various SO42-/NH4+ ratios (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5) were performed at controlled COD/SO42- ratio of 4.0. The highest SO42-/NH4+ ratio of 2.5 provided 76.6 and 72.8% sulfate and ammonium removal efficiencies, respectively, and also reached the highest yield of elemental sulfur and nitrogen gas of 0.68 g S-0/g SO42--S-added and 0.66 g N-2/g NH4+-N-added, respectively. Microbial consortium structure providing the highest removal efficiencies was consequently analyzed using Illumina sequencing and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis approaches. Taxonomic assignments demonstrated that Proteobacteria (46%), Firmicutes (15%), and Bacteroidetes (14%) were the most abundant phyla. Almost core genera analysis with two distinguished approaches demonstrated similar results. Aside from microbial community analysis, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to validate existing abundance of aforementioned seven dominant microorganisms. The nitrous oxide reductase gene was shown the most abundance (10(8) copies/mu L) which plays a crucial role for simultaneous removal of sulfur and nitrogen compounds.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1735-1472	1735-2630		WOS:000486155600034		
J	KUHN, MG; VERMAAS, WFJ								DELETION MUTATIONS IN A LONG HYDROPHILIC LOOP IN THE PHOTOSYSTEM-II CHLOROPHYLL-BINDING PROTEIN CP43 IN THE CYANOBACTERIUM SYNECHOCYSTIS SP PCC6803								PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY				23	1			123	133		10.1007/BF00021425				OCT 1993	1993	In order to investigate the role and function of the hydrophilic region between transmembrane regions V and CI in the photosystem II core antenna protein CP43, we introduced eight different deletions in psbC of Synechocystis sp; PCC 6803 resulting in a loss of 7-11 codons in evolutionary conserved domains in this region. All deletions resulted in an obligate photoheterotrophic phenotype (requirement of glucose for cell growth) and the absence of any detectable oxygen evolution activity. The various deletion mutations showed a different impact on the amount of CP43 in the thylakoid, ranging from wild-type levels of (a now slightly smaller) CP43 to no detectable CP43 at all. All deletions led to a decrease in the amount of the D1 and D2 proteins in the thylakoids with a larger effect on D2 than on D1. CP47, the other major chlorophyll-binding protein, was present in reduced but significant amounts in the thylakoid. Herbicide binding (diuron) was lost in all but one mutant indicating the PSII components are not assembled into functionally intact complexes. Fluorescence-emission spectra confirmed this notion. This indicates that the large hydrophilic loop of CP43 plays an important role in photosystem II, and even though a shortened CP43 is present in thylakoids of most mutants, functional characteristics resemble that of a mutant with interrupted psbC.									30	0	0	0	23	0	30			0167-4412	1573-5028		WOS:A1993MC24600012	8219045

However, the synthesis of SACs with high active site density still remains a great challenge due to the easy aggregation of high density metal atoms during the synthesis. In the present work, we develop a stepwise anchoring strategy for the large-scale preparation of carbon-supported high-density Pt SACs (denoted as PtSA@BP). The Pt loading of PtSA@BP is as high as 2.5 wt%, leading to the observation of abundant closely distanced single Pt sites. The produced PtSA@BP catalyst exhibits ultrahigh catalytic activity for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction with a low overpotential of 26 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH under ultralow Pt loadings of 0.0009 mg(Pt) cm(-2) on the electrode, much superior to commercial Pt/C (20 wt%). Mechanistic studies suggest the main contribution of the coordination of closely distanced three-coordinated PtC2N1 moieties to the excellent catalytic activities towards the conversion of water to H-2, due to their close-to-zero metal-hydrogen binding value and intense adsorption capability to H2O molecules as well as their low water-dissociation energy barrier. More importantly, this strategy has been verified to be feasible for preparing other noble-metal based SACs, for example, Rh and Pd. The present result provides an enabling and versatile platform for facile access of SACs with technological importance in various areas.									15	2	0	0	0	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000519615700022

YS, ScS, and ZrS were modeled in the rocksalt structure with the (1 0 0) facet; TiS, VS, CrS, NbS, NiS, and FeS in NiAs-type structure with the (1 1 1) facet; and MnS2, CoS2, IrS2, CuS2, OsS2, FeS2, RuS2, RhS2, and NiS2 in pyrite structure for both the (1 0 0) and (1 1 1) orientations. As the first step towards determination of sulfides that are less prone to hydrogen evolution, the competition between adsorption of NNH and H (for the associative mechanism), and between adsorption of N and H (for the dissociative mechanism) on these surfaces was considered. The catalytic activity through both the associative and dissociative mechanisms was explored and the overpotential required for electrochemical ammonia formation is reported. The scaling relations and volcano plots were constructed with free energy of adsorption of NNH or N on the surface as the descriptor. RuS2 was observed as the most active sulfide that could catalyze nitrogen reduction to ammonia at potentials around -0.3 V through the associative mechanism. NbS, CrS, TiS, and VS are also promising candidates for both the associative and dissociative mechanisms with overpotentials for nitrogen reduction around 0.7-1.1 V.									26	3	0	0	0	0	27			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000483875900001	31313891

The former is produced via O-2 evolution and the latter is incorporated by the intermediate hydroxyl radicals generated during the potentiostatic oxidation of H2O in 1 M H2SO4 at 1.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). When applied as a supercapacitor, the potentiostatically treated EGO (EGO-PS) shows significant enhancement in an electric-double layer (EDL) process with a noticeable Faradaic reaction and delivers high capacitance at fast charge/discharge (C/D) rates (334 F g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) and 230 F g(-1) at 50 A g(-1)). In contrast to EGO-PS, EGO that is oxidized potentiodynamically (EGO-PD) shows negligible enhancement in EDL currents. EGO that is subjected to successive potential pulses also shows behaviors similar to EGO-PD, which indicates the importance of hydroxyl radical accumulation via a potentiostatic method for simultaneous functionalization and microstructural control of graphenes. The potentiostatic post-treatment presented here is a convenient post-treatment strategy that could be used to readily increase capacitance and simultaneously improve the high-rate performance of carbon-based electrodes.

In frame of these studies, Doppler broadening of annihilation line (DB) measurements were performed. For a sample heated in vacuum the oxide film ca. 8 nm is observed. For specimens oxidized in air and N-2 the multi-layered oxide films of about a few hundred nanometers are recognized. The RBS/NR measurements have shown that the sample annealed in vacuum contains a lower quantity of oxygen while for samples heated in the air and N-2 non-linear and rather linear time-dependency are observed, respectively. The thicknesses of total oxide films obtained from RBS/NR tests are in good agreement with the VEP results. Time evolution of the oxide growing was studied as well. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, N and S co-doped graphene quantum dots (N, S-GQDs) and Au nanoparticles are successfully co-modified on atomic ultrathin Bi2MoO6 nanosheet, and the prepared hybrid material displays exceptional performance in charge carrier transfer and light harvest. The obtained hybrid material possesses excellent photocatalytic activity in molecular oxygen activation for oxytetracycline (OTC) degradation with 3.69-fold higher reaction rate than pristine Bi2MoO6 under visible light irradiation. In addition, it also possesses near-infrared-light-driven catalytic activity, about 24.47% of OTC can be degraded under nearinfrared light irradiation. Moreover, the hybrid material displays outstanding catalytic performance for actual wastewater treatment, and it also possesses high photostability. The mechanism exploration reveals that the boosted photocatalytic performance is originated from three aspects. The up-conversion photoluminescence feature of N, S-GQDs broadens photoresponse range, and the light nanoantenna and SPR effect of Au nanoparticle enhance light absorption intensity. Meanwhile, both N, S-GQDs and Au nanoparticles accelerate charge carrier transfer, the surface charge transfer efficiency of pristine Bi2MoO6 and hybrid material are calculated to be 33.74% and 53.04%, respectively. Furthermore, the possible photodegradation pathway of OTC is also inquired according to liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This work provides inspiration to rationally design high-performance full-spectrum-light-driven catalysts in molecular oxygen activation for environmental modification.									23	0	0	0	6	0	23			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000618083100002

The plasma treatment does not change the structure, specific surface area and morphology of catalyst, but introduce nitrogen vacancies into g-C3N4. The atmosphere has a significant effect on the nitrogen photofixation performance of as-prepared catalyst using methanol as hole scavenger. Under the atmosphere of 50% O-2 and 50% N-2, the as-prepared N vacancies embedded g-C3N4 displays the ammonium ion production rate as high as 5.5 mg.L-1.h(-1).g(cat)(-1), which is 2.1 times higher than that under pure nitrogen atmosphere. The effect of oxygen on the N-2 photofixation ability over N vacancies embedded g-C3N4 is investigated.

Evolution of the catalyst particle size distribution due to collision, sintering and evaporation of metal during SWCNT synthesis is discussed. The active catalyst has been demonstrated to be in a reduced metal form by comparison of the experimental data and calculations regarding the equilibrium concentration of carbon and oxygen in iron. Also the effect of the catalyst particle size on melting temperature and carbon solubility in metal is discussed. The stability of different carbon precursors (hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide) is considered thermodynamically. Furthermore, estimation of the maximum length of I and 2.5 nm diameter SWCNTs as a function of carbon solubility is conducted to determine whether carbon dissolution and precipitation are simultaneous or subsequent process steps.									490	9	0	0	25	0	504			0953-8984	1361-648X		WOS:000186489900004

Here, we describe a computational pipeline for identifying the range of threedimensional (3D) cell-aggregate sizes in which nonisometric scaling emerges in the presence of joint mass and metabolic rate fluctuations. The 3D cell-laden spheroids with size and single-cell metabolic rates described by probability density functions were randomly generated in silico. The distributions of the resulting metabolic rates of the spheroids were computed by modeling oxygen diffusion and reaction. Then, a method for estimating scaling exponents of correlated variables through statistically significant data collapse of joint probability distributions was developed. The method was used to identify a physiologically relevant range of spheroid sizes, where both nonisometric scaling and a minimum oxygen concentration (0.04 mol center dot m-3) is maintained. The in silico pipeline described enables the prediction of the number of experiments needed for an acceptable collapse and, thus, a consistent estimate of scaling parameters. Using the pipeline, we also show that scaling exponents may be significantly different in the presence of joint mass and metabolicrate variations typically found in cells. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating fluctuations and variability in size and metabolic rates when estimating scaling exponents. It also suggests the need for taking into account their covariations for better understanding and interpreting experimental observations both in vitro and in vivo and brings insights for the design of more predictive and physiologically relevant in vitro models.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0027-8424			WOS:000709574100016	34526399

The main mechanism responsible for the transfer of ferric iron towards the mantle is the production of magnetite during the hydrothermal alteration of the oceanic crust. Both modeling and compilation of chemical data lead to a flux of 21 x 10(3) kg s(-1) of ferric iron transported by the subducted oceanic crust. The net flux of ferric iron towards the deep mantle is estimated to be 12 x 10(3) kg s(-1) when corrected from the production rates of basic magmas at oceanic ridges, island arcs, and hot spots. We discuss several hypotheses. Ferric iron could react at depth with reduced species that buffer the redox state of the mantle to its present-day value. One possible mechanism could be the reaction of this ferric iron with the core that would have been reduced by only 500 m since 2 Ga. At the opposite, we may also consider that ferric iron accumulates in the deep mantle, being possibly accepted by the structure of spinel, garnet, and perovskite. The transfer of ferric iron from subducted slabs to the mantle contributes from 10 to 25% in the global budget of the ferric iron component of the mantle.

The value of the exchange current density J(0) increases linearly with the increase of the step atom density d(S) from n = infinity to n = 9, where n denotes the number of terrace atomic rows, on (n-1)(1 1 1)-(1 1 0), n(1 0 0)-(1 1 1), and n(1 0 0)-(1 1 0) series. This indicates that the activity for the HOR/HER of the step is higher than that of the terrace. The values of j(0) of (n-1)(1 1 1)-(1 1 0), n(1 0 0)-(1 1 1) and n(1 0 0)-(1 1 0) series become constant on the surfaces with n <= 9, whereas those of n(1 1 1)-(1 0 0) series increase with the increase of d(S). The activity for the HOR/HER per step atom increases in the sequence: n(1 1 1)-(1 0 0) < n(1 0 0)-(1 1 1) < n(1 0 0)-(1 1 0) < (n-1)(1 1 1)-(1 1 0). This result supports that the most active site for the HOR/HER is the linear (1 1 0) step. Decrease of the NOR current is found around 0.2 V(RHE) on the surfaces with (1 0 0) terrace, whereas the surfaces with (1 1 1) terrace give no decrease of the HOR current. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The goal of this paper is to study in ISO 5660 cone calorimeter the thermal behaviours of carbon fibre/epoxy composite covered by a liner made of polyamide 6 (PA6) or polyurethane (PU). Time-to-ignition, amount and rate of mass loss, heat release rate, total heat release rate and effective heat of combustion were measured and calculated at three irradiance levels (20, 40 and 60 kW m(-2)). The main exhaust gaseous species evolution as well as oxygen consumption were also quantified during the thermal decomposition process. The transient temperatures were measured at middle-thickness of composite layer and at composite/liner interface by using K-type thermocouples. Indeed, these technical data play a significant role to choose the adequate liner to be used for full-composite cylinder application. Results show that the liner type has no effect on flaming ignition of exposed composite as well as the temperature profiles within materials. Comparing to PA6, the PU liner presents a faster melting and decomposition rate (i.e. with a lower thermal resistance), a lower heat release rate levels and low major gas (i.e. CO, CO2 and NO) emission yields (i.e. a lower gaseous product toxicity). Based on the comparison of the fire-to-reaction properties, the PU thermoplastics are recommended to be used as liner to cover gas storage composite cylinder.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0015-2684	1572-8099		WOS:000371644500009

We examined the potential roles for haemocyanin in the animal's symbiosis with the luminous bacterium Vibrio fischeri. Our data demonstrate that, as in other cephalopods, the haemocyanin is primarily synthesized in the gills. It transits through the general circulation into other tissues and is exported into crypt spaces that support the bacterial partner, which requires oxygen for its bioluminescence. We showed that the gradient of pH between the circulating haemolymph and the matrix of the crypt spaces in adult squid favours offloading of oxygen from the haemocyanin to the symbionts. Haemocyanin is also localized to the apical surfaces and associated mucus of a juvenile-specific epithelium on which the symbionts gather, and where their specificity is determined during the recruitment into the association. The haemocyanin has an antimicrobial activity, which may be involved in this enrichment of V. fischeri during symbiont initiation. Taken together, these data provide evidence that the haemocyanin plays a role in shaping two stages of the squid-vibrio partnership.									33	0	0	0	30	0	33			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000335812100030	24807261

The anodes were characterized by linear and cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, service lifetime tests, and morphology factors. Furthermore, physical characterizations included X-ray diffractometry and scanning electron microscopy to obtain information on their crystallographic structure and surface morphology, respectively. Finally, electrocatalytic activity was tested by electrolysis for 1?h in solutions containing 10?ppm of Diuron? using various electrolytes (Na2SO4, Na2CO3, NaNO3, NaCl). The highest superficial area and oxygen evolution onset potential, the longest service lifetime, and considerable Diuron(?) degradation rates in all electrolytes were obtained for (SnO2)(93)Sb5Ce2 (32%). However, it is essential to highlight the outstanding service lifetime presented by (SnO2)(93)Sb5Bi2 (46.32?h), overcoming the results for (SnO2)(93)Sb5Ce2 by over 50-fold. This behavior is associated with the peculiar nanoflower star-like surface organization seen in the scanning electron microscopy images.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0098-6445	1563-5201		WOS:000494228900001

Herein, Pt nanoclusters (~1.6 nm) uniformly anchored on ordered macroporous nitrogen-doped carbon support (Pt-30/NCM) with only 3.39 wt% Pt loading is rationally constructed via a polystyrene spheres (PS) template method followed by an impregnating method as a highly enhanced electrocatalyst for alkaline HER. Benefiting from the enhanced mass and charge transport via the ordered macroporous carbon structure as well as the strong metal-support interaction between Pt nanoclusters and nitrogen-doped carbon framework, Pt-30/NCM exhibits superior intrinsic activity and operation stability compared to the solid counterpart without ordered macropores (Pt-30/NCS), even affording a more than 10 times higher mass activity and much better operation stability after 3000 cycles than those of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the strong coupling between Pt nanoclusters and nitrogen-doped carbon support can induce favorable charge transfer for accelerated water dissociation as well as desirable d-band center position for suitable adsorption and desorption of alkaline HER intermediates, thus contributing to remarkably improved kinetics of hydrogen production.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773695600002

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) derived heteroatom-doped carbon-based (NC) electrocatalysts have exhibited comparable electrocatalytic activity for ORR as commercial Pt/C catalyst, which were highly dependent on their MOF precursor/template structures. In this particular work, two NC composites, NC-1100 and MnO@NC-1100 (NC, nitrogen-doped carbon), have been successfully synthesized, which were derived from novel nitrogen-rich tetrazolate-based metal-organic frameworks, [Cd-2(L)(OH)(H2O)] (1) and [Cd3Mn(L)(2)(OH)(2)(H2O)(2)] (2) (L, 5'-(4-(1H-tetrazol-5-y1)(benzamido)benzene-1,3-dioic acid), respectively. The structural differences between complexes 1 and 2 arose from the introduction of Mn(II) to complex 2, where the Cd(II) in 1 was partially replaced by Mn(II). Both complexes 1 and 2 possessed three-dimensional (3D) structures with one-dimensional (1D) open channels. The resultant MnO@NC-1100 from the pyrolysis of complex 2 at 1100 degrees C under Ar atmosphere has indicated much better electrocatalystic behavior for ORR over the NC-1100 from complex 1, due to the existence of additional active sites of cubic phase MnO particles. The presence of initial Cd(II) benefits the spatial isolation of Mn(II) and prevents the sintering of MnO during the pyrolysis for MnO@NC-1100. The evaporation of Cd(II) and the explosion of nitrogen-rich tetrazolate groups would also promote the surface area of the resulting catalysts. Our study further demonstrated that the multiple metal centers of MOF could be the rational strategy to enhance the electrocatalytical performance. Compared with NC-1100, MnO@NC-1100 exhibited the enhanced electrocatalytic activity with an onset potential (E-onset) of 0.90 V and a half-wave potential (Ehalf-wave) of 0.74 V, which provided an insight view of the structure property relationship.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			1528-7483	1528-7505		WOS:000466987600055

In this paper, we have synthesized Li-doped Co3O4 (Li/Co = 0, 2.5%, 5%, 7.5%) solid solution nanocrystals through direct nucleation and growth of the lithium-cobalt oxide on a acid-treated carbon black. The carbon supports LixCo3-xO4 spinel nanocrystals with average particle size of approximately 4 nm, covered evenly on the surface of carbon in this hybrid. The electrocatalysis experiments in an alkaline solution reveal a close correlation between the ORR electrocatalytic activities and the doped Li contents of these LixCo3-xO4/C catalysts. Interestingly, the half-wave potential and the mass-specific activity of these catalysts show a typical volcano plot as a function of Li contents. Among all the synthesized Co3-xO4/C samples, the sample prepared at the Li/Co atomic ratio of 5% displays the most positive half-wave potential and the largest mass-specific activity respectively, which are 70 mV and 3.3 times higher than the undoped Co3O4/C. Compared with that of the undoped Co3O4/C, the remarkly increased content of covalent O=C-O-Co-III-O bonds formed at the interfaces between Li-doped Co3O4 and carbon support is responsible for the improved electro-catalytic performances of the doped catalyst. Moreover, the covalent electron transfer from the Co-III species to the electron-withdrawing O=C-O species through the O=C-O-Co-III-O bonds can not only promote the oxidation of active sites Co-III into Co-IV but also facilitate the surface hydroxide displacement, which can significantly contribute to the ORR kinetics. Therefore, the exact understanding of the unique interfacial electronic structures of the LixCo3-xO4/C hybrids is very important to develop the lithium-cobalt oxides on carbon as next-generation catalysts for ORR.									12	2	0	0	1	0	13			2046-2069			WOS:000364053500069

Fuel pyrolysis is modeled via finite-rate Arrhenius kinetics. A simplified two-step global reaction mechanism is considered for the gas-phase chemistry to model the combustion of 1,3-butadiene in oxygen. Results are compared with the firing test data obtained from a laboratory-scale hybrid rocket in which gaseous oxygen is fed into axisymmetric hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene cylindrical grains through an axial conical subsonic nozzle. With the oxidizer fed by this injector, which generates nonuniform conditions at the entrance of the fuel port, the fuel regression rate is shown to increase several times with respect to the case of homogeneous injection of the oxidizer through all the grain port area, in agreement with the experimental findings. The spatial distribution of the regression rate is substantially different from the one expected in a turbulent developing flow through a pipe because of the presence of a strong recirculation zone at the motor head end. Numerical simulations, although not capturing the absolute regression-rate values, are fairly able to predict the main ballistic features: that is, the regression rate's weaker dependence on the mass flux, the influence of port diameter, and the pressure evolution over time, as well as the general trends of different firing tests.									27	0	2	0	0	0	29			0748-4658	1533-3876		WOS:000360839900016

This uniformity character observed after a long reaction time seems to contrast with the great diversity of reaction mechanisms observed in the early stages of oxidation. The numerous studies carried out on the oxidation of terpenes, and more particularly on limonene for its diversity of reaction sites (endo- and oxocyclic), allow this evolution to be studied. We have selected, for their diversity of experimental conditions, nine studies of limonene oxidation at room temperature over long reaction times to be compared to the present data set obtained at elevated temperature and short reaction time in order to investigate the similarities in terms of reaction mechanisms and chemical species formed. Here, the oxidation of limonene-oxygen-nitrogen mixtures was studied using a jet-stirred reactor at elevated temperature and atmospheric pressure. Samples of the reacting mixtures were collected and analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrometry (Orbitrap) after direct injection or after separation by reverse-phase ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography and soft ionization, i.e., (+/-) HESI and (+/-) APCI. Unexpectedly, because of the diversity of experimental conditions in terms of continuous-flow tank reactor, concentration of reactants, temperature, reaction time, mass spectrometry techniques, and analysis conditions, the results indicate that among the 1138 presently detected molecular formulae, many oxygenates found in earlier studies of limonene oxidation by OH and/or ozone are also pro-duced under the present conditions. Among these molecular formulae, highly oxygenated molecules and oligomers were detected in the present work. The results are discussed in terms of reaction pathways involving the initial formation of peroxy radicals (RO2), isomerization reactions yielding keto-hydroperoxides, and other oxygenated intermediates and products up to C25H32O17, products which could derive from RO2 autoxidation via sequential H shift and O-2 addition (C10H14O3,(5,7,9,11)) and products deriving from the oxidation of alkoxy radicals (produced by RO2 self-reaction or reaction with HO2) through multiple H shifts and O-2 additions (C10H14O2,4,6,8,10). The oxidation of RO2, with possible occurrence of the Waddington mechanism and of the Korcek mechanism, involving H shifts is also discussed. The present work demonstrates similitude between the oxidation products and oxidation pathways of limonene under simulated atmospheric conditions and in those encountered during the self-ignition of hydrocarbons at elevated temperatures. These results complement those recently reported by Vereecken and Noziere and confirm for limonene the existence of an oxidative chemistry of the alkylperoxy radical beyond 450K based on the H shift (Noziere and Vereecken, 2019; Vereecken and Noziere, 2020).									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1680-7316	1680-7324		WOS:000656055200001

Metal ions in life sciences				12				417	50		10.1007/978-94-007-5561-1_12				2013	2013	As a trace element copper has an important role in cellular function like many other transition metals. Its ability to undergo redox changes [Cu(I) Cu(II)] makes copper an ideal cofactor in enzymes catalyzing electron transfers. However, this redox change makes copper dangerous for a cell since it is able to be involved in Fenton-like reactions creating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cu(I) also is a strong soft metal and can attack and destroy iron-sulfur clusters thereby releasing iron which can in turn cause oxidative stress. Therefore, copper homeostasis has to be highly balanced to ensure proper cellular function while avoiding cell damage.Throughout evolution bacteria and archaea have developed a highly regulated balance in copper metabolism. While for many prokaryotes copper uptake seems to be unspecific, others have developed highly sophisticated uptake mechanisms to ensure the availability of sufficient amounts of copper. Within the cytoplasm copper is sequestered by various proteins and molecules, including specific copper chaperones, to prevent cellular damage. Copper-containing proteins are usually located in the cytoplasmic membrane with the catalytic domain facing the periplasm, in the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria, or they are secreted, limiting the necessity of copper to accumulate in the cytoplasm. To prevent cellular damage due to excess copper, bacteria and archaea have developed various copper detoxification strategies. In this chapter we attempt to give an overview of the mechanisms employed by bacteria and archaea to handle copper and the importance of the metal for cellular function as well as in the global nutrient cycle.									53	0	0	0	41	0	53			1559-0836			MEDLINE:23595679	23595679

ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				826	2					169	10.3847/0004-637X/826/2/169				AUG 1 2016	2016	A pivotal feature for the viability of white dwarf (WD) collisions as SN Ia progenitors is that a significant fraction of the mass is highly compressed to the densities required for efficient Ni-56 production before the ignition of the detonation wave. Previous studies have employed model WDs composed of carbon-oxygen (CO), whereas WDs typically have a non-negligible helium envelope. Given that helium is more susceptible to explosive burning than CO under the conditions of WD collision, a legitimate concern is whether or not early time He detonation ignition can lead to early time CO detonation, drastically reducing Ni-56 synthesis. We investigate the role of He in determining the fate of WD collisions by performing a series of two-dimensional hydrodynamics calculations. We find that a necessary condition for non-trivial reduction of the CO ignition time is that the He detonation birthed in the contact region successfully propagates into the unshocked shell. We determine the minimal He shell mass as a function of the total WD mass that upholds this condition. Although we utilize a simplified reaction network similar to those used in previous studies, our findings are in good agreement with detailed investigations concerning the impact of network size on He shell detonations. This allows us to extend our results to the case with more realistic burning physics. Based on the comparison of these findings against evolutionary calculations of WD compositions, we conclude that most, if not all, WD collisions will not be drastically impacted by their intrinsic He components.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000381977900069

The self-doped TNTA was fabricated by a simple electrochemical reduction of TNTA in neutral electrolyte solution, and then IrO2 nano particles were deposited by pulse electro-deposition method. The cyclic voltammetric behavior, electrical conductivity and micro structure of self-doped TNTA prepared at different reduction potential were characterized to obtain an optimal performance, and self-doped TNTA prepared under -1.9 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) shows the best electrochemical performance. After depositing IrO2, the OER activity and stability of new electrodes were also determined. Due to the enhanced electrical conductivity of support, the mass activity of IrO2/self-doped TNTA are 50 times higher than IrO2/TNTA. The OER stability of new electrode was evaluated under constant current of 5 mA/cm(2), IrO2/TNTA and IrO2/Ti were also tested for comparison. A higher stability of IrO2/self-doped TNTA electrode is observed than the other two electrodes, and XPS studies indicate a lower oxidation state of Ir in IrO2/self-doped TNTA, this shows a possible interactions between IrO2 and the new support.

Herein, we demonstrate the development of an interconnected network of core-shell CoP@CoBiPi through anodic polarization of a CoP nanoarray in potassium borate aqueous electrolyte (KBi). This 3D CoP@CoBiPi exhibits high catalytic activity for water oxidation at pH9.2 and needs an overpotential () of only 410mV to drive a geometrical catalytic current density of 10mAcm(-2), with a high turnover frequency of 819h(-1) at an overpotential of 610mV. Remarkably, this catalyst also demonstrates high long-term electrochemical stability with its activity being maintained for at least 27h in KBi. This study provides us an attractive earth-abundant 3D catalyst electrode for water-splitting devices toward efficient and stable water oxidation under benign conditions.									56	0	0	0	0	0	56			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000398838600010	28188690

The reagent, copper(II)-neocuproine (Cu(II)-Nc) complex, was immobilized onto a cation-exchanger film of Nafion, and the absorbance changes associated with the formation of the highly-colored Cu(I)-Nc chelate as a result of reaction with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was measured at 450 nm. When catalase was absent, H2O2 produced the CUPRAC chromophore, whereas catalase, being an effective H2O2 scavenger, completely annihilated the CUPRAC signal due to H2O2. Thus, the CUPRAC absorbance due to H2O2 oxidation concomitant with Cu(I)-Nc formation decreased proportionally with catalase. The developed sensor gave a linear response over a wide concentration range of (0.68-78.6 mu M). This optical sensor-based method applicable to tissue homogenates proved to be efficient for low hydrogen peroxide concentrations (physiological and nontoxic levels) to which the widely used UV method is not accurately responsive. Thus, conventional problems of the UV method arising from relatively low sensitivity and selectivity, and absorbance disturbance due to gaseous oxygen evolution were overcome. The catalase findings of the proposed method for tissue homogenates were statistically alike with those of HPLC. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AuNi1.5-T showed the highest oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity compared to bare AuNi1.5, and it demands only 239 mV overpotential, which was 134 mV lesser than the overpotential required by commercial RuO2 at 10 mA cm(-2) current density in a 1 M KOH solution (pH = 14). The calculated turnover frequency (TOF) value for AuNi1.5-T (0.0229 s(-1)) was 11.74 times higher than that of AuNi1.5 (0.00195 s(-1)). Also, the electrochemically activated AuNi1.5-T showed superior neutral water oxidation activity by demanding only 335 mV overpotential with a TOF value of 0.000135 s(-1) in a 1 M Na2SO4 solution (pH = 7) at 10 mA cm(-2). The long-term stability studies (over 60 h) reveal the excellent robustness of an electrochemically treated alloy system. Density functional theory based electronic structure calculations showed that in the case of AuNi and AuNi1.5, Au d, Au s, and Ni d orbitals have significant contributions, whereas in the Ni-vacant systems, the density of states is mainly governed by d orbitals of Au and Ni. Also, the Ni-vacant system possesses a work function value of 4.96 eV, which is lower than that of the pristine system (5.27 eV) and thereby favored OH- binding with an optimum adsorption energy. This result is in reasonable agreement with the experimental outcome of an accelerated OER in a vacancy-enriched Ni-rich AuNi alloy system. Also, mechanistic analysis reveals that the creation of a Ni vacancy can effectively alter the overall mechanism of the OER and thereby facilitate the same with a lower applied energy.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000809419100020	35613470

The observed sticking probability S shows a good correlation with alkali coverage, indicating that the alkali promotion is local in nature. The decay of S as a function of NO dose as observed with AES shows an anticorrelation with the evolution of the direct-inelastic scattering intensity as obtained with REMPI. This fact is understood as follows: since the direct-inelastic scattering occurs mostly in a single collision process with the surface, local alkali promotion is realized in a single collision of the incident NO molecule with the alkali-metal adsorbates. The decay of S as a function of NO dose is then analyzed with a reaction cross section. The evaluated reaction cross sections are close to the area of the 2 X 1 unit cell, and thus the estimated reaction radii are almost equal to but somewhat larger than the covalent radius of a K atom, with a increasing trend with alkali coverage. The alkali promotion is explained in terms of local electron charge transfer from the nonionized alkali adatoms to the affinity level of NO molecules based on the adatom density of state around E(F).									20	1	0	0	0	0	21			0021-9606			WOS:A1992JL37200098

When cells that had been grown at 20 degrees C were transferred to 35 degrees C, the thermal stability of the oxygen-evolving machinery increased and within 8 h it was equivalent to that in cells grown initially at 35 degrees C. Such enhancement of thermal stability was prevented by cycloheximide and by lincomycin, suggesting that the synthesis de novo of proteins encoded by both the nuclear and the chloroplast genome was required for this process. No increase in thermal stability was observed when cells that had been grown at 35 degrees C were exposed to heat shock at 41 degrees C, optimum conditions for the induction of the synthesis of homologs of three heat shock proteins (Hsps), namely, Hsp60, Hsp70, and Hsp22. Moreover, no synthesis of these homologs of Hsps was induced at 35 degrees C. Thus it appears likely that Hsps are not involved in the enhancement of the thermal stability of the oxygen-evolving machinery.									55	1	0	0	49	0	56			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000089306200043	10982457	
J	Zhou, L; Li, RJ; Li, JF; Shen, SK								VPO catalyst doped with Ce-Zr composite oxide for n-butane selective oxidation to maleic anhydride								CHINESE JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				23	1			72	76						JAN 2002	2002	A new VPO catalyst was prepared by doping with an appropriate amount of Ce-Zr composite oxide. The doped-catalyst possesses significantly improved catalytic performance compared with the pure VPO catalyst. In the n-butane/air co-feed reaction, the mole yield of maleic anhydride over the doped catalyst is doubled as compared with that over the pure VPO catalyst. In the absence of gas-phase oxygen, the amount of lattice oxygen in the doped catalyst that is selective to maleic anhydride is 1.2 times higher than that in the pure VPO catalyst. The results of the BET surface area measurement, X-ray diffraction, average vanadium valence measurement, arid temperature-programmed experiments show that a small quantity of Ce-Zr composite oxide present in active phases of the catalyst takes part in the redox process of the VPO system. The addition of the Ce-Zr composite oxide has two functions: (1) to promote the formation Of (VO)(2)P(2)O7 phase and maintain the average vanadium valence, which are in favor of obtaining the VPO catalyst with a good phase structure and stable catalytic performance; (2) to improve the redox property of the VPO catalyst remarkably and thereby increase the amount of reversible lattice oxygen stored in the catalyst dramatically.									5	20	0	0	0	0	21			0253-9837			WOS:000173814100017

Iron oxide coatings were deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates at 300 degrees C under optimized conditions, and subsequently annealed ex situ in air at 650 degrees C. Structural and compositional analyses confirmed the formation of pure alpha-Fe2O3 (hematite), free from other crystalline iron oxide phases. Controlled variations of the deposition time enabled tuning of the thickness and nano-aggregate sizes in the resulting deposits and, correspondingly, their current-voltage characteristics. A maximum photocurrent density close to 1mAcm(-2) was achieved at 1.23V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), without the need of any oxygen evolution catalyst or over/underlayer. The present findings revealed the key role played by the engineering of Fe2O3-based nanomaterials, resulting ultimately in a lowered carrier diffusion length, and in an optimal diffusion of tin from FTO into thinner layers. These features offer an amenable opportunity for harvesting radiant energy to trigger water photoelectrolysis and produce clean hydrogen in a carbonneutral fashion.

In contrast to modern oceans, where abundant sulfate precipitates in hot oceanic crust as anhydrite, Precambrian oceans contained much less (similar to 0-10 mM) sulfate, so that submarine hydrothermal systems were comparatively poor in anhydrite. As a step towards exploring the role of chemical evolution of seawater solutes, we investigate the reaction between basalt and seawater that took place at the ca. 2.43-2.41 Ga Vetreny Belt (Karelia craton, NW Russia) using fluid inclusion and multi-isotope measurements complemented by reactive transport and static aqueous-mineral equilibrium calculations. Using fluid inclusion measurements by LA-ICP-MS, we constrain the Sr concentration in the least modified seawater-derived fluids and address the effect of phase separation. Then, we complement the previous delta O-18-Delta'O-17 datasets with new Sr-87/Sr-86 measurements performed on 2.41 Ga epidote from the Vetreny Belt, and recent (0-6 Ma) oceanic epidote from Reykjanes, Iceland and the drilling site 504B in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The 2.41 Ga epidote with Sr-87/(86)Srinitial of 0.7029-0.7042 and Delta'O-17 of -0.06 to 0.00% is best explained by a relatively high fraction (similar to 90%) of marine Sr that was delivered from contemporaneous seawater with Sr-87/Sr-86 approximate to 0.7045, and without significant removal by early anhydrite. Using Monte-Carlo simulation of a dual-porosity model, we constrain the range of possible exchange trajectories based on the variability of physical parameters (porosity, fluid flow velocity, fracture spacing, recrystallization rates). Further, we use a series of static equilibrium seawater-basalt reaction calculations with emphasis on the possible range of marine Ca/SO4 values at 2.41 Ga. Our calculations demonstrate that co-existing quartz and epidote in absence of feldspars represent equilibrium with less-evolved hydrothermal fluids. Consequently, equilibrium assemblage of quartz and epidote provide an insightful archive for marine Sr. Based on our modeling and assumptions about marine Sr-87/Sr-86 and Sr/Ca ratios, the 2.41 Ga epidotes document a seawater-basalt reaction where the initial fluid contained between 30 and 40 mM of Ca and 0-10 mM SO4, representing a high marine input and the possible effect of phase separation. Based on our data, we suggest that high Ca/SO4 ratio of seawater (>> 1) and low concentration of anhydrite in submarine systems of the contemporaneous oceans promote a higher fraction of seawater Sr to be permanently stored in silicates of altered oceanic crust. In contrast, modern altered oceanic crust is depleted in radiogenic Sr due to partitioning into anhydrite, which partly returns into the ocean upon cooling.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0301-9268	1872-7433		WOS:000652101500012

Here, we report a one-step and facile approach to synthesize graphene based materials from coal under ambient conditions via direct CO2 laser scribing. The obtained laser scribed graphene from coal (C-LSG) has been well characterized, showing good electrical conductivity (12 Omega/square), high electrochemical sensitivity and ionic storage properties. These properties make C-LSG a multifunctional material for applications in Joule heating, electrochemical dopamine sensing, and supercapacitors. Moreover, when electrochemically deposited with FeNi hydroxide, the hybridized FeNi/C-LSG shows impressive electrocatalysis performance toward oxygen evolution reaction. As such, this direct laser scribing of coal into graphene based materials can not only potentially expands new business opportunities by adding coal into the valuechain of industries that usually do not use coal as the starting materials in their manufacturing processes but also brings down the cost of the graphene based materials, which would make their deployment in various field more economically attractive.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, one of the PSII subunits (CP43/PsbC) was suggested to be assembled into the PSII complex via its interaction with an auxiliary protein called Low PSII Accumulation 2 (LPA2). However, the original articles describing the role of LPA2 in PSII assembly have been retracted. To investigate the function of LPA2 in the model organism for green algae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we generated knockout lpa2 mutants by using the CRISPR-Cas9 target-specific genome editing system. Biochemical analyses revealed the thylakoidal localization of LPA2 protein in the wild type (WT), whereas lpa2 mutants were characterized by a drastic reduction in the levels of D1, D2, CP47 and CP43 proteins. Consequently, reduced PSII supercomplex accumulation, chlorophyll content per cell, PSII quantum yield and photosynthetic oxygen evolution were measured in the lpa2 mutants, leading to the almost complete impairment of photoautotrophic growth. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that the absence of LPA2 protein caused reduced PSII assembly and reduced PSII turnover. Taken together, our data indicate that, in C. reinhardtii, LPA2 is required for PSII assembly and proper function.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0960-7412	1365-313X		WOS:000679731900001	34218480

Developing highly active water oxidation electrodes with affordable fabrication costs is thus of great importance. Herein, a (NiFeIII)-Fe-II surface species on Ni metal substrate was generated by electro-chemical modification of Ni in a ferrous solution by a fast, simple, and cost-effective procedure. In the prepared NiIIFeIII catalyst film, Fe-III was incorporated uniformly through controlled oxidation of FeII cations on the electrode surface. The catalytically active Ni-II originated from the Ni foam substrate, which ensured the close contact between the catalyst and the support toward improved charge-transfer efficiency. The asprepared electrode exhibited high activity and long-term stability for electrocatalytic water oxidation. The overpotentials required to reach water oxidation current densities of 50, 100, and 500 mAcm(-2) are 276, 290, and 329 mV, respectively.									59	5	0	0	0	0	59			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000394571900010	27870261

Electrical properties after thermal oxidation, of B-LPCVD polysilicon films								2009 6th International Multi-Conference on Systems, Signals and Devices								5 pp.	5 pp.		10.1109/SSD.2009.4956644				2009	2009	In this paper, we present the electrical properties evolution, following a dry thermal oxidation, of LPCVD polycrystalline silicon layers. The polysilicon thin films deposited on monosilicon substrates, at different temperatures (Td = 520 to 605degC), are highly in situ boron doped (2times1020 cm-3). The thermal oxidation treatment was carried out under dry oxygen atmosphere at the temperatures Tox = 840, 945 and 1050degC. SIMS Profiles, as well as the resistivity measures, show clearly that this treatment largely influences the electric behaviour of polycrystalline silicon films. It results from the deduced values of the diffusion coefficients, that diffusivity DGB, in the grain boundaries, are higher than those in the grains, when the temperature is lower than 1000degC. While for Tox = 1050degC, this tendency is reversed. Furthermore, the activation energy of DGB is lower than DG one. We consider that the precipitation of the doping agent in the grain boundaries is one of the principal causes of these remarkable results when compared with slightly doped polysilicon. The results rising from behaviour, with respect to electrical conduction, reveal that the films present overall a resistivity reduction in consequence of oxidation. This is correlated with an improvement of the films crystallinity.					2009 6th International Multi-Conference on Systems, Signals and Devices2009 6th International Multi-Conference on Systems, Signals and Devices	23-26 March 200923-26 March 2009		Djerba, TunisiaDjerba, Tunisia	0	0	0		0	0	0					978-1-4244-4345-1	INSPEC:10663782

However, the detailed reduction mechanism remains unclear because of lack of methods for online monitoring of GO thermal reduction. In this study, the thermal reduction of GO (from 20 degrees C up to 400 degrees C in argon atmosphere) was successfully monitored online and investigated through temperature-dependent FTIR spectroscopy combined with scaling-MW2D FTIR spectroscopy and generalized 2D correlation analyses. Raman spectroscopy, XPS, and XRD studies were also conducted to characterize the structural changes before and after reduction. SEM and AFM analyses were performed to directly observe the formation of defects in GO after thermal reduction. According to scaling-MW2D results, the thermal reduction of GO was divided into two processes, namely, 35 degrees C-182 degrees C (process I) and 182 degrees C-385 degrees C (process II). Process I rapidly eliminates oxygen functional groups, and process II gradual removes them. The 2D correlation analysis for each process indicated the sequential order of movements of the oxygen-containing functional groups during thermal reduction. Process I comprised six steps, and process II contained four sequential steps. This work elucidated the complex deoxygenation steps and the mechanism of GO thermal reduction. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Many of the current models treat both diffusion/consumption of nutrients and cell proliferation. The majority of these models use classical transport/mass conservation equations for describing the distribution of molecular species in tumor spheroids, and the Fick's law for describing the flux of uncharged molecules (i.e oxygen, glucose). Commonly, the equations for the cell movement and proliferation are first order differential equations describing the rate of change of the velocity of the cells with respect to the spatial coordinates as a function of the nutrient's gradient. Several modifications of these equations have been developed in the last decade to explicitly indicate that the tumor includes cells, interstitial fluids and extracellular matrix: these variants provided a model of tumor as a multiphase material with these as the different phases. Most of the current reaction-diffusion tumor models are deterministic and do not model the diffusion as a local state-dependent process in a non-homogeneous medium at the micro-and meso-scale of the intra-and inter-cellular processes, respectively. Furthermore, a stochastic reaction-diffusion model in which diffusive transport of the molecular species of nutrients and chemotherapy drugs as well as the interactions of the tumor cells with these species is a novel approach. The application of this approach to he scase of non-small cell lung cancer treated with gemcitabine is also novel.Methods: We present a stochastic reaction-diffusion model of non-small cell lung cancer growth in the specification formalism of he tool Redi, we recently developed for simulating reaction-diffusion systems. We also describe how a spatial gradient of nutrients and oncological drugs affects the tumor progression. Our model is based on a generalization of the Fick's first diffusion law that allows to model diffusive transport in non-homogeneous media. The diffusion coefficient is explicitly expressed as a function depending on the local conditions of the medium, such as the concentration of molecular species, the viscosity of the medium and the temperature. We incorporated this generalized law in a reaction-based stochastic simulation framework implementing an efficient version of Gillespie algorithm for modeling the dynamics of the interactions between tumor cell, nutrients and gemcitabine in a spatial domain expressing a nutrient and drug concentration gradient.Results: Using the mathematical framework of model we simulated the spatial growth of a 2D spheroidal tumor model in response to a treatment with gemcitabine and a dynamic gradient of oxygen and glucose. The parameters of the model have been taken from recet literature and also inferred from real tumor shrinkage curves measured in patients suffering from non-small cell lung cancer. The simulations qualitatively reproduce the time evolution of the morphologies of these tumors as well as the morphological patterns follow the growth curves observed in patients.Conclusions: This model is able to reproduce the observed increment/decrement of tumor size in response to the pharmacological treatment with gemcitabine. The formal specification of the model in Redi can be easily extended in an incremental way to include other relevant biophysical processes, such as local extracellular matrix remodelling, active cell migration and traction, and reshaping of host tissue vasculature, in order to be even more relevant to support the experimental investigation of cancer.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			1471-2105			WOS:000309358500014	23095709

Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is introduced in the precursor solutions in order to promote uniform nucleation of CBO and prevent formation of the secondary phase, such as Bi2O3, by Bi3+ ion hydrolysis. Slow PVP molecule decomposition during the two-step annealing process, with a 1 M/0.5 M (Bi3+/Cu2+) metal ion concentration, enables optimum contact at the CBO/substrate interface by avoiding formation of voids. This resulted in the formation of non-porous, compact CBO thin films. The highest current density of the photoelectrochemical (PEC) oxygen reduction reaction is obtained with non-porous, compact CBO thin films due to unimpeded charge transport through the CBO bulk, as well as across the interface. When combined with silicon, the high-density CBO thin film investigated in this work is expected to provide new PEC tandem cell options to use for solar applications.

J	Kong, De-Sheng								The influence of fluoride on the physicochemical properties of anodic oxide films formed on titanium surfaces								LANGMUIR				24	10			5324	5331		10.1021/la703258e				MAY 20 2008	2008	The influence of fluoride (and its concentration) on the electrochemical and semiconducting properties of anodic oxide films formed on titanium surfaces was investigated by performing electrochemical measurements (potentiodynamic/ pontiostatic polarization, open circuit potential (OCP), and capacitance measurements) for a titanium/oxide film/ solution interface system in fluoride-containing 1.0 M HClO4 solution. On the basis of the Mott-Schottky analysis, and with taking into account both the surface reactions (or, say, the specifically chemical adsorption) of fluoride ions at the oxide film surface and the migraion/intercalation of fluoride ions into the oxide film, the changes in the electrochemical behavior of titanium measured in this work (e.g., the blocked anodic oxygen evolution, the increased anodic steady-state current density, the positively shifted flat band potential, and the positively shifted film breakdown potential) were interpreted by the changes in the surface and the bulk physicochemical properties (e.g., the surface charges, surface state density, doping concentration, and the interfacial potential drops) of the anodic films grown on titanium. The fluoride concentrations tested in this work can be divided into three groups according to their effect on the electrochemical behavior of the oxide films: <= 0.001 M, 0.001-0.01 M, and >0.01 M. By tracing the changes of the OCP of the passivated titanium in fluoride-containing solutions, the deleterious/depassive effect of fluoride ions on the titanium oxide films was examined and evaluated with the parameter of the film breakdown time. It was also shown that the films anodically formed on titanium at higher potentials (> 2.5 V) exhibited significantly higher stability against the fluoride attack than that either formed at lower potentials (<2.5 V) or formed natively in the air.									106	7	0	0	13	0	110			0743-7463			WOS:000255856100024	18442276

Positive grids have been developed with very low corrosion rates, However, there Is little quantitative data available on negative plate self-discharge rates that are required to balance web low corrosion rates. This paper presents values measured from several different battery brands, American and European, The data shows clearly that some production batteries have high negative self-discharge rates that account for the observed tendency for self-discharge in service. Surprisingly, the data also shows that other brands have achieved extremely low self-discharge rates - low enough to be compatible with the best positive grids that we have tested. These results are very encouraging for VRLA technology and confirm that the principle can be realized. The focus now shifts to the practical Issues: finding the source of the impurities that increase hydrogen evolution and weighing the cost and practicality of reducing them.					32nd International Telecommunications Energy Conference32nd International Telecommunications Energy Conference	SEP 10-14, 2000SEP 10-14, 2000	IEEE, Power Electr SocIEEE, Power Electr Soc	PHOENIX, AZPHOENIX, AZ	2	0	0	0	0	0	2					0-7803-6407-4	WOS:000165310600072

From the results, it was concluded that the biochar catalyst enhanced the polymerization of the volatiles produced from the pyrolysis, and thus reduced the yields of the gaseous compounds while increased the yield of char. The carbonaceous deposit on surface of the char was oxygen-rich and more aliphatic, which decreased the thermal stability and crystallinity of the char, while made the char prone to oxidation. The biochar catalyst also promoted the formation of methoxy phenols at the expense of alkyl phenols, and the formation of the phenolics with bigger pi-conjugated structures. In addition, the volatile-biochar interaction removed the defective structures in the large aromatic structures in the biochar catalyst.HighlightsBiochar catalyzed polymerization, but not cracking, of volatiles in pyrolysis.Biochar catalyst enhances char formation while reduces gas formation in pyrolysis.Char in catalytic pyrolysis is more O-rich and aliphatic and low thermal stability.Biochar catalyzed condensation of volatiles to form bigger fused ring structures.Biochar-volatiles interaction removes defective structure in fused ring of biochar.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000638435100001

The evolved [(C5H5N)(2)V2O3 center dot H2O] nanobelts are of 50-200 nm in width and of a length up to several millimeters. At higher temperatures (600 degrees C), the solid [(C5H5N)(2)V2O3 center dot H2O] nanostructures are converted to vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) and vanadium dioxide (VO2) when heated in air and nitrogen atmosphere, respectively. During growth, the mechanism of the evolution of octahedra, truncated octahedra, and hollow truncated octahedra of [(C5H5N)(2)V2O3 center dot H2O] are reported for the first time. These types of well-structured morphology are also isolated while V2O5 and VO2 are evolved. The as-grown belt-like and octahedral morphologies of [(C5H5N)(2)V2O3 center dot H2O] are retained during the solid-state transformation, suggesting a route to evolve crystalline nanomaterials. Again, the morphological evolution of the [(C5H5N)(2)V2O3 center dot H2O] nanostructures has been examined to be pyridine and precursor vanadyl sulfate (VS) concentration dependent. Thus, we are able to isolate truncated octahedra as an intermediate during the formation of [(C5H5N)(2)V2O3 center dot H2O] nanobelts and nanoflowers with a high pyridine (Py) concentration. Interestingly, longer reaction times successively featured the transformation of truncated octahedra into nanobelts. Nanobelt evolution is not observed at low pyridine concentrations. However, the formation of octahedral morphology takes place at low pyridine concentration. All of the nanostructures were critically examined and characterized thoroughly by various physical techniques to ascertain their purity, structure and composition. An interesting, thermodynamically stable, single crystalline product from DMF soluble [(C5H5N)(2)V2O3 center dot H2O] has been characterized, which indirectly supports the composition of [(C5H5N)(2)V2O3 center dot H2O]. Selectively, vanadium pentoxide nanobelts have been found to be an efficient catalyst for the oxidative coupling of 2-naphthol to binaphthols under a molecular oxygen atmosphere.									18	0	1	0	1	0	18			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000346907800046	25486444

Discovering ICL-inducing agents is, thus, crucial for the characterization of ICL repair pathways and Fanconi anemia, a genetic disease caused by mutations in ICL repair genes. Although several studies point to oxidative stress as a cause of ICLs, oxidative stress-induced cross-linking events remain poorly characterized. Also, polycyclic aromatic amines, potent environmental carcinogens, have been implicated in producing ICLs, but their identities and sequences are unknown. To close this knowledge gap, we tested whether ICLs arise by the oxidation of 8-arylamino-2'-deoxyadenosine (ArNHdA) lesions, adducts produced by arylamino carcinogens. Herein, we report that ArNHdA acts as a latent cross-linking agent to generate ICLs under oxidative conditions. The formation of an ICL from 8-aminoadenine, but not from 8-aminoguanine, highlights the specificity of 8-aminopurine-mediated ICL production. Under the influence of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) nitrosoperoxycarbonate, ArNHdA (Ar = biphenyl, fluorenyl) lesions were selectively oxidized to generate ICLs. The cross-linking reaction may occur between the C2-ArNHdA and N2-dG, presumably via oxidation of ArNHdA into a reactive diiminoadenine intermediate followed by the nucleophilic attack of the N2-dG on the diiminoadenine. Overall, ArNHdA-mediated ICLs represent rare examples of ROS-induced ICLs and polycyclic aromatic amine-mediated ICLs. These results reveal novel cross-linking chemistry and the genotoxic effects of arylamino carcinogens and support the hypothesis that C8-modified adenines with low redox potential can cause ICLs in oxidative stress.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000721355500020	34726902

ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				514						A53	10.1051/0004-6361/200913892				MAY 2010	2010	The explosion of sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs via the double detonation scenario is a potential explanation for type Ia supernovae. In this scenario, a surface detonation in a helium layer initiates a detonation in the underlying carbon/oxygen core leading to an explosion. For a given core mass, a lower bound has been determined on the mass of the helium shell required for dynamical burning during a helium flash, which is a necessary prerequisite for detonation. For a range of core and corresponding minimum helium shell masses, we investigate whether an assumed surface helium detonation is capable of triggering a subsequent detonation in the core even for this limiting case. We carried out hydrodynamic simulations on a co-expanding Eulerian grid in two dimensions assuming rotational symmetry. The detonations are propagated using the level-set approach and a simplified scheme for nuclear reactions that has been calibrated with a large nuclear network. The same network is used to determine detailed nucleosynthetic abundances in a post-processing step. Based on approximate detonation initiation criteria in the literature, we find that secondary core detonations are triggered for all of the simulated models, ranging in core mass from 0.810 up to 1.385 M(circle dot) with corresponding shell masses from 0.126 down to 0.0035 M(circle dot). This implies that, as soon as a detonation triggers in a helium shell covering a carbon/oxygen white dwarf, a subsequent core detonation is virtually inevitable.									282	7	0	0	2	0	282			0004-6361			WOS:000280504800020

Cyanobacteria continue to play a significant role in primary production [4] and in regulating the global marine and limnic nitrogen cycles [5, 6]. Relatively little is known, however, about the evolutionary history and gene content of primordial cyanobacteria [7, 8]. To address these issues, we used protein similarity networks [9], containing proteomes from 48 cyanobacteria as the test group, and reference proteomes from 84 microbes representing four distinct metabolic groups from most reducing to most oxidizing: methanogens, obligate anaerobes (nonmethanogenic), facultative aerobes, and obligate aerobes. These four metabolic groups represent extant bioinformatic proxies for ancient redox chemistries, extending from an anoxic origin through the GOE and ultimately to obligate aerobes [10-13]. Analysis of the network metric degree showed a strong relationship between cyanobacteria and obligate anaerobes, from which cyanobacteria presumably arose, for core functions that include translation, photosynthesis, energy conservation, and environmental interactions. These data were used to reconstruct primordial functions in cyanobacteria that included nine gene families involved in photosynthesis, hydrogenases, and proteins involved in defense from environmental stress. The presence of 60% of these genes in both reaction center I (RC-I) and RC-II-type bacteria may be explained by selective loss of either RC in the evolutionary history of some photosynthetic lineages. Finally, the network reveals that cyanobacteria occupy a unique position among prokaryotes as a hub between anaerobes and obligate aerobes.									27	0	1	0	21	0	29			0960-9822	1879-0445		WOS:000350708800026	25683807

Here, by means of density functional theory, we characterize the adsorption and dissociation of selected diatomic molecules (CO, H-2, O-2, and NO) on the MoSe2 monolayer. We consider that these processes occur on the pristine 1H-MoSe2 monolayer and in the vicinity of an isolated Se vacancy. The presence of a single Se vacancy both enhances the molecular adsorption and reduces the energy needed for dissociation, making it energetically favorable for the case of O-2 and NO molecules. Moreover, the presence of a second Se vacancy makes the dissociation process energetically favorable for all the molecules that are studied here. For each case we evaluate the effect that each adsorbate has on the electronic structure of the MoSe2 monolayer and the charge transfer that takes place between the adsorbate and the surface. Remarkably, adsorption of either CO or NO at the Se vacancy induces a finite spin-magnetization in the system that is spatially well localized around the adsorbate and the three closest Mo atoms.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2469-9950	2469-9969		WOS:000740877100002

Considering the rich properties of perovskite oxides and their drawbacks of low specific area and easy cation leaching, we reported a facile postsynthesis hydrothermal treatment method for preparing SrCo0.6Ti0.4O3-delta@CoOOH (SCT@CoOOH) nanocomposite as an efficient catalyst for PMS activation here. Surprisingly, CoOOH nanosheets were grown in situ over the surface of SCT substrate, resulting in a significantly increased surface area (22.1 m(2) g(-1)), enhanced charge transfer capability, more generated surface oxygen defects and a strongly synergistic effect created between the bulk SCT and CoOOH surface layer. Remarkably, SCT@CoOOH exhibited higher (1.7 times) catalytic activity (0.84 mg L-1 min(-1)) for phenol degradation than SCT. Additionally, suppressed cobalt leaching was demonstrated in the SCT@CoOOH/PMS system. Notably, singlet oxygen as additional oxidative species were formed to accelerate phenol degradation in the radical-based SCT@CoOOH/PMS system due to the surface oxygen defects. The beneficial effect of higher pH value and different influence of foreign anions on the reation rate were also investigated. As a universal method, it may be also useful for the development of innovative functional materials for other various applications.									47	2	0	0	21	0	47			2168-0485			WOS:000449577200232

D-2 exchange with residual OH groups showed that each W initially replaced about two zeolitic protons for W/A1 ratios of 0.29 and 0.44, consistent with the formation of (WO2)(2+) containing W6+ species bridging two cation exchange sites. As temperatures reached similar to 973 K during D-2-OH exchange, these species reduced to (WO2)(+) with the concurrent formation of one OD group. CH4 conversion turnover rates (per W) and C-2-C-12 selectivities are very similar to those observed on a Mo/H-ZSM5 sample with similar cation exchange level. As in the case of Mo/H-ZSM5, WOx/H-ZSM5 precursors are initially inactive in CH4 reactions, but they activate during induction with the concurrent evolution of CO, H2O, and an excess amount of H-2 The reduction and carburization processes occurring during CH4 reactions and the structure of the exchanged WOx precursors was probed using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), XAS studies confirmed the isolated initial nature of the exchanged WOx precursors after hydrolysis and dehydration and the formation of WCx clusters similar to0.6 nm in diameter during CH4 reactions at 973 K, The structural and catalytic resemblance between W- and Mo-exchanged H-ZSM5 is not unexpected, in view of chemical similarities between oxides or carbides of Mo and W. The synthesis of exchanged WOx precursors and their subsequent carburization during CH4 reactions, however, are more difficult than the corresponding processes for the MoOx counterparts. This may account for previous reports of lower CH4 reaction rates and aromatics selectivities on W/H-ZSM5 compared with those observed on Mo/H-ZSM5 and with those reported hen for rigorously exchanged W/H-ZSM5.

Here, a series of morphologically controlled low-crystalline CuCo2O4 was prepared by thermal oxidation of self-assembled Cu-Co precursors (p-CCO). One-dimensional (1D) rod-like of CuCo2O4 was subsequently encapsulated in polypyrrole shell (PPy) by in-situ polymerization of pyrrole monomers as an advanced catalyst (CCO/PPy) for high-performance Na-CO2 batteries. It was demonstrated that ammonia solution exerts an important influence on the surface morphology and size of the p-CCO crystallites by the rate of nucleation and growth. Particle size and 1D architecture modulation, associated with the encapsulation of conductive PPy effectively improve the directional transfer rate of ions and the conductivity of the electrode. More importantly, PPy introduction not only induces interfacial reconstruction of CuCo2O4, arousing more oxygen vacancies and catalytic active sites, but also contributes to the corrosion protection of the active material from the electrolyte during long-term operation. Bestowed by these advantages, the fabricated hybrid Na-CO2 battery manifested prominent electrochemical performance with a superior areal discharge capacity of 31.3 mAh cm-2, low discharge-charge voltage gap of 0.6 V, over 400 cycles.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000763367500004

Here, we report three crystal structures of HGDO, revealing five different steps in its reaction cycle at 1.7-1.98 angstrom resolution. The resting state structure displays an octahedral coordination for Fe2+ with two histidine residues (His331 and His367), a bidentate carboxylate ligand (Glu337), and two water molecules. Homogentisate binds as a monodentate ligand to Fe2+, and its interaction with Tyr346 invokes the folding of a loop over the active site, effectively shielding it from solvent. Binding of homogentisate is driven by enthalpy and is entropically disfavored as shown by anoxic isothermal titration calorimetry. Three different reaction cycle intermediates have been trapped in different HGDO subunits of a single crystal showing the influence of crystal packing interactions on the course of enzymatic reactions. The observed superoxo: semiquinone-, alkylperoxo-, and product-bound intermediates have been resolved in a crystal grown anoxically with homogentisate, which was subsequently incubated with dioxygen. We demonstrate that, despite different folds, active site architectures, and Fe2+ coordination, extradiol dioxygenases can proceed through the same principal reaction intermediates to catalyze the O-2-dependent cleavage of aromatic rings. Thus, convergent evolution of nonhomologous enzymes using the 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad motif developed different solutions to stabilize closely related intermediates in unlike environments.									42	0	0	0	22	0	44			0027-8424			WOS:000322441500039	23858455

Both coating types were produced in a low-pressure (15 Pa) microwave excited hexamethyldilisazane (HMDSN) plasma. Residual stress values were obtained using a high-throughput, time resolved andin-situmeasurement method, including a CCD-camera, a line laser and micro-machined cantilever sensor chips. Both plasma polymer types were shown to form residual stresses with opposite signs. The stress evolution in the coatings revealed a strong dependency on the variation of power input for deposition. The SiO(x)coating exhibits mostly compressive stresses. Higher power inputs constitute higher ion momentums as well as a higher degree of fragmentation of the monomer. The SiO(x)coatings were deposited with a high oxygen flow and with a higher average energy of the plasma for all investigated parameter sets than the SiNOCH coating. Therefore, it is conceivable that ion peening is mostly responsible for the compressive stress formation in the SiO(x)coatings. In contrast to the SiO(x)coating, the SiNOCH coating can be applied without residual stress. For higher excitation powers, tensile stresses are predominant, most likely due to attractive forces between island or column boundaries and crosslinking.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000542542400001

NANOMATERIALS				11	11					3156	10.3390/nano11113156				NOV 2021	2021	The effect of the nature of the catalyst on the performance and mechanism of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is discussed for the first time in this work. HOR is an anodic reaction that takes place in anionic exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) and hydrogen pumps (HPs). Among the investigated catalysts, Pt exhibited the best performance in the HOR. However, the cost and the availability limit the usage. Co is incorporated as a co-catalyst due to its oxophylic nature. Five different PtCo catalysts with different Pt loading values were synthesized in order to decrease Pt loading. The catalytic activities and the reaction mechanism were studied via electrochemical techniques, and it was found that both features are a function of Pt loading; low-Pt-loading catalysts (Pt loading < 2.7%) led to a high half-wave potential in the hydrogen oxidation reaction, which is related to higher activation energy and an intermediate Tafel slope value, related to a mixed HOR mechanism. However, catalysts with moderate Pt loading (Pt loading > 3.1%) exhibited lower E-1/2 than the other catalysts and exhibited a mechanism similar to that of commercial Pt catalysts. Our results demonstrate that Co plays an active role in the HOR, facilitating H-ads desorption, which is the rate-determining step (RDS) in the mechanism of the HOR.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2079-4991		WOS:000727693600001	34835920

The results show that the vapor-phase PAHs and particulate-bound PAHs exist in GDI engine exhaust emissions. Soot particles are formed by the agglomeration of the quasi-spherical primary carbon particles, and the size of the PAH cluster is close to that of the core of the primary carbon particles. To predict soot particulates evolution in the engine cylinder, a reduced toluene reference fuel (TRF)-PAH chemical mechanism consisting of iso-octane, n-heptane and toluene as gasoline surrogate fuels for the GDI engine combustion simulation was developed. The reduced mechanism contains 232 reactions and 85 species, including 17 species and 40 elementary reactions, related to the PAH formation, which could well capture the oxidation characteristics of ignition delays and laminar flame speeds, as well as PAH emissions from the GDI engine. Then, a mathematical soot growth model coupled with the reduced TRF-PAH mechanism was developed based on the method of moment. The obtained experimental soot emissions were well predicted by this soot model. The distribution of particle number density was consistent with the distribution of A4 and C2H2, and the growth and distribution of soot mass was determined by the particle surface growth due to C2H2, the nuclear reaction of A4 and the particle surface oxidation reaction.

However, the reaction kinetics of hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is two orders of magnitude slower in alkaline systems than in acid. To understand the slower kinetics of HOR in base, two major theories have been proposed, such as (1) pH dependent hydrogen binding energy as a major descriptor for HOR; and (2) bifunctional theory based on the contributions of both hydrogen and hydroxide adsorption for HOR in alkaline electrolyte. Here, we discuss the possible HOR mechanisms in alkaline electrolytes with the corresponding change in their Tafel behavior. Apart from the traditional Tafel-Volmer and Heyrovsky-Volmer HOR mechanisms, the recently proposed hydroxide adsorption step is also discussed to illustrate the difference in HOR mechanisms in acid and base. We further summarize the representative works of alkaline HOR catalyst design (e.g., precious metals, alloy, intermetallic materials, Ni-based alloys, carbides, nitrides, etc.), and briefly describe their fundamental HOR reaction mechanism to emphasize the difference in elementary reaction steps in alkaline medium. The strategy of strengthening local interaction that facilitates both H-2 desorption and H-ads + OHads recombination is finally proposed for future HOR catalyst design in alkaline environment.

The transition was induced by the deposition of excess cesium or oxygen on the p-GaAs(Cs, O) surface activated to the state of negative electron affinity. Under deposition of excess cesium, the escape probability was significantly lower as compared to excess oxygen, presumably, due to reflection and scattering of electrons on two-dimensional cesium metal clusters. Under Cs-induced transition, at positive values of affinity, a new peak was observed below the band gap in the photoemission quantum yield spectra. The peak stems, presumably, from: (i) the effective capture of sub-bandgap light in the structure, which consists of the heavily doped p+-GaAs epilayer grown on the semi-insulating GaAs substrate, due to diffuse backside reflection from the rough back surface of the substrate; (ii) absorption of the captured light near the emitting p+-GaAs surface due to the Franz-Keldysh effect in the strong surface electric field; (iii) emission of the electrons generated near the surface.					7th International School and Conference "Saint Petersburg OPEN 2020": Optoelectronics, Photonics, Engineering and Nanostructures7th International School and Conference "Saint Petersburg OPEN 2020": Optoelectronics, Photonics, Engineering and Nanostructures	27-30 April 202027-30 April 2020		St. Petersburg, RussiaSt. Petersburg, Russia	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1742-6596			INSPEC:20265109

Cellular stress, in particular oxidative stress caused by an increase in levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), activates FOXOs through JNK-mediated phosphorylation. Importantly, JNK regulation of FOXO is evolutionarily conserved. Here we identified the pathway that mediates ROS-induced JNK-dependent FOXO regulation. Following increased ROS, RALA is activated by the exchange factor RLF (RalGDS-like factor), which is in complex with JIP1 (C-Jun-amino-terminal-interacting protein 1) and JNK. Active RALA consequently regulates assembly and activation of MLK3, MKK4, and JNK onto the JIP1 scaffold. Furthermore, regulation of FOXO by RALA and JIP1 is conserved in C. elegans, where both ral-1 and jip-1 depletion impairs heat shock-induced nuclear translocation of the FOXO orthologue DAF16.									22	0	0	0	22	0	26				1083-351X		WOS:000328841900024	23770673

This threshold represents an estimated upper limit for sulfur isotope mass-independent fractionation (S-MIF), an Archean signature of atmospheric anoxia that begins to disappear from the rock record at 2.45 Ga. However, an increasing number of papers have suggested that the timing for oxidative continental weathering, and by conventional thinking the onset of atmospheric oxygenation, was hundreds of million years earlier than previously thought despite the presence of S-MIF. We suggest that this apparent discrepancy can be resolved by the earliest oxidative-weathering reactions occurring in benthic and soil environments at profound redox disequilibrium with the atmosphere, such as biological soil crusts and freshwater microbial mats covering riverbed, lacustrine, and estuarine sediments. We calculate that oxygenic photosynthesis in these millimeter-thick ecosystems provides sufficient oxidizing equivalents to mobilize sulfate and redox-sensitive trace metals from land to the oceans while the atmosphere itself remained anoxic with its attendant S-MIF signature. As continental freeboard increased significantly between 3.0 and 2.5 Ga, the chemical and isotopic signatures of benthic oxidative weathering would have become more globally significant from a mass-balance perspective. These observations help reconcile evidence for pre-GOE oxidative weathering with the history of atmospheric chemistry, and support the plausible antiquity of a terrestrial biosphere populated by cyanobacteria well before the GOE.									132	2	0	0	60	0	134			0027-8424			WOS:000348417000027	25583484

The crystal structure of BNT and BNTM25 ceramics were refined by the Rietveld method with powder X-ray diffraction at room temperature. A production of small amount of oxygen vacancies, a significant enhancement in tetragonality and a grain size effect due to the MnO2 doping, led to the enhancements of the electromechanical and electrical properties of Bi0.5Na0.5Ti1-xMnxO3-delta ceramics, and the optimized modification was x = 0.25%. The electrical properties of modified samples were deteriorated with further doping (x = 0.5-2%), owing to an obvious ferroelectric to relaxor phase transition and an increase in the concentration of oxygen vacancies. The BNTM25 ceramics was found to have a high remnant polarization (P-r) of 48.5 mu C/cm(2), an electromechanical coupling factor (k(p)) of 0.18, an electro-field-induced strain (S-total) of 0.24% and a piezoelectric coefficient (d(33)) of 105 pC/N. In addition, almost no profound fatigue was observed after switching over 10(6) cycles at room temperature, indicating a potential application as lead-free piezoelectric materials.

We report a strategy to enable the catalytic activity of monolayer MoS2 films that are even better than that of Pt via engineering the interaction of the monolayer with supporting substrates. The monolayer films were grown with chemical vapor deposition processes and controlled to have an optimal density (7-10%) of sulfur vacancies. We find that the catalytic activity of MoS2 can be affected by substrates in two ways: forming an interfacial tunneling barrier with MoS2 and modifying the chemical nature of MoS2 via charge transfer (proximity doping). Following this understanding, we enable excellent catalytic activities at the monolayer MoS2 films by using substrates that can provide n-doping to MoS2 and form low interfacial tunneling barriers with MoS2 such as Ti. The catalytic performance may be further boosted to be even better than Pt by crumpling the films on Ti coated flexible polymer substrates, as the Tafel slope of the film is substantially decreased with the presence of crumpling-induced compressive strain. The monolayer MoS2 films show no degradation in catalytic performance after being continuously tested for over 2 months.									54	2	0	0	2	0	54			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000518024700041	31944096

Here, we report that the morphologies and electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) properties of bismuth nanoparticles (BiNPs) can be rationally modulated by their interactions with carbon black (CB) supports by controlling the degree of surface oxidation. Appropriately oxidized CB supports can provide sufficient oxygen-containing groups for anchoring BiNPs with tunable sizes and surface areas, desirable key intermediate adsorption abilities, appropriate surface wettability, and adequate electron transfer abilities. As a result, the optimized Bi/CB catalysts exhibited a promoted CO2RR performance with a Faradaic efficiency of 94% and a current density of 16.7 mA cm(-2) for HCOO- at -0.9 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode. Our results demonstrate the significance of regulating the interactions between supports and metal nanoparticles for both synthesis of the catalyst and electrolysis applications, which may find broader applicability in more electrocatalyst designs.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000723814500001	34846444

Here, we report manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieve (OMS-2) materials with remarkably high thermal stability, synthesized by a simple one-pot synthesis in a neutral medium. The high thermal stability was confirmed by the retention of the cryptomelane phase at 750 degrees C in air. Mechanistic studies were performed by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy and ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) to monitor the change in oxidation state and the phase evolution during the thermal transformation. These two techniques revealed the intermediate phases formed during the nucleation and growth of highly crystalline cryptomelane manganese oxide. Thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), time-dependent studies of field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) techniques confirm the formation of these intermediates. The amorphous phase of manganese oxide with random nanocrystalline orientation undergoes destructive reformation to form a mixture of birnessite and hausmannite during its thermal transformation to pure crystalline OMS-2. The material still has a relatively high surface area (80 m(2)/g) even after calcination to 750 degrees C. The surfactant was used as a capping agent to confine the growth of OMS-2 to form short nanorods. In the absence of the surfactant, the OMS-2 extends its growth in the c direction to form nanofibers. The particle sizes of OMS-2 can be controlled by the temperatures of calcination. The OMS-2 calcined at elevated temperatures (400-750 degrees C) shows high remarkable catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in aqueous alkaline solution that outperformed the activity of synthesized solvent-free OMS-2. The activity follows this order: OMS-2(500) (degrees C) > OMS-2(750) (degrees C) > OMS-2(400 degrees C).

In a similar manner to reaction centres in natural photosystems, molecular(2) and metal oxide(3) catalysts have been used to photochemically oxidize water. However, the various approaches involving the molecular design of ligands(4), surface modification(5) and immobilization(6,7) still have limitations in terms of catalytic efficiency and sustainability. Here, we demonstrate a biologically templated nanostructure for visible light-driven water oxidation that uses a genetically engineered M13 virus scaffold to mediate the co-assembly of zinc porphyrins (photosensitizer) and iridium oxide hydrosol clusters (catalyst). Porous polymer microgels are used as an immobilization matrix to improve the structural durability of the assembled nanostructures and to allow the materials to be recycled. Our results suggest that the biotemplated nanoscale assembly of functional components is a promising route to significantly improved photocatalytic water-splitting systems.									206	6	0	0	54	0	210			1748-3387			WOS:000278264300012	20383127

This particular chemical composition is the starting point of extensive research studies in several domains such as bio-disinfectant in biomedical applications or as fertilizer in agricultural applications. These various applications need adjustments of the PAW properties and consequently require a better control of the PAW chemical composition. To achieve this aim, a UV spectrophotometric method (190-255 nm) is implemented to simultaneously detect the nitrate and nitrite ions in plasma activated water by a gliding arc discharge reactor at atmospheric pressure. The method, tested in plasma activated distilled water (PADW) and in plasma activated tap water (PATW), shows significant increases of nitrite and nitrate concentrations. Preliminary results on PADW and PATW kinetics evolutions highlight a different behavior of the temporal post-discharge reactions leading to non-conversion of the nitrite ions in the case of PATW. The near non-existence of acidification during and after plasma activation encountered in PATW is due to high levels of carbonate species in tap water acting as a buffer solution. Indeed, the presence of hydrogen carbonate (HCO3-) leads to the acidity consumption during plasma activation whereas the presence of non-dissolved limestone in hard water (CaCO3) acts as carbonates reserve, and this induces the acidity consumption after plasma treatment.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0021-8979	1089-7550		WOS:000661619600014

Alternatively, air and nitrous oxide were used as oxygen precursors. C2H4 was used as an energy transfer agent. The underlying phenomena for this photon-based molecular nanotechnology are discussed. For the present report, different titania nanosized powder batches were obtained by variation of the oxidizer nature and TiCl4 precursor flows. X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, x-ray dispersive energy analysis, and IR and Raman spectrometry have been used to analyse the nanostructures and morphologies of the as-synthesized powders. Medium and high resolution TEM analyses indicate mean grain sizes between 12 and 28 nm. The different characterization techniques suggest that in the obtained anatase and rutile mixture the fraction of rutile phase depends on the nature of the oxygen precursor. At low TiCl4 flows, no chlorine contamination was detected in the reaction product. Further examination of the influence of other important system parameters will open new possibilities for titania preparation by the laser pyrolysis of TiCl4.									54	0	0	0	1	0	59			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000221679800024

It is shown that by specifying the synthesis conditions, for example, the number of SILD cycles, it is possible to change the size of nanocrystals, and for 2D crystals - their orientation with respect to the substrate. Along with this, in the article for the first time a novel SILD route of Co(II)Co(III) LDH synthesis is presented. It was stated that the nanolayers of this compound consist of randomly oriented 2D nanocrystals aggregates with hexagonal hydrotalcite-like crystal structure, each of which has a thickness of less than 3 nm. The method is based on the sequential processing of the substrate in aqueous solutions of CoCl2 and NaBH4 salts of certain concentrations and intermediate washing excess of these reagents with distilled water. The obtained nanolayers were characterized via SEM, TEM, XRD, FT-IR and XPS methods. Models of chemical processes occurring on the surface during the synthesis were suggested on the basis of the obtained experimental results. The samples were acquired on the nickel foam (NF) surface and were studied as electrodes for pseudocapacitors and as electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. The electrodes of the pseudocapacitor showed high specific capacitance (2260 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g), as well as good cyclic stability (after 500 charge-discharge cycles, the capacitance drop do not exceed 2%). In addition, the obtained material showed a high electrocatalytic activity for OER in alkaline medium, characterized at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) by a relatively low overpotential of 285 mV and Tafel slope of 95 mV/dec (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

J	Li Yanhe; Hou Kejun; Wan Defang; Yue Guoliang								Archean mass-independent fractionation of sulfur isotope: New evidence of bedded sulfide deposits in the Yanlingguan-Shihezhuang area of Xintai, Shandong Province								ACTA GEOLOGICA SINICA-ENGLISH EDITION				82	2			444	450						APR 2008	2008	Multiple sulfur isotope ratios (S-14/S-33/S-32) of Archean bedded sulfides deposits were measured in the Yanlingguan Formation of the Taishan Group in Xintai, Shandong Province, East of China; delta S-33 = -0.7 parts per thousand to 3.8 parts per thousand, delta S-34 = 0.1 parts per thousand-8.8 parts per thousand, Delta S-33 = -2.3 parts per thousand, to -0.7 parts per thousand. The sulfur isotope compositions show obvious mass-independent fractionation (MIF) signatures. The presence of MIF of sulfur isotope in Archean sulfides indicates that the sulfur was from products of photochemical reactions of volcanic SO2 induced by solar UV radiation, implying that the ozone shield was not formed in atmosphere at that time, and the oxygen level was less than 10(-5) PAL (the present atmosphere level). The sulfate produced by photolysis of SO2 with negative Delta S-33 precipitated near the volcanic activity center; and the product of element S with positive Delta S-33 precipitated far away from the volcanic activity center. The lower Delta S-33 values of sulfide (-2.30 parts per thousand to -0.25 parts per thousand) show that Shihezhuang was near the volcanic center, and sulfur was mostly from sulfate produced by photolysis. The higher Delta S-33 values (4.5 parts per thousand to -2 parts per thousand) indicate that Yanlingguan was far away from the volcanic center and that some of sulfur were from sulfate, another from element S produced by photolysis. The data points of sulfur isotope from Yanlingguan are in a line parallel to MFL (mass dependent fractionation line) on the plot of delta S-34-delta S-33, showing that the volcanic sulfur species went through the atmospheric cycle into the ocean, and then mass dependent fractionation occurred during deposition of sulfide. The data points of sulfur isotope from Shihezhuang represent a mix of different sulfur source.									4	3	0	0	0	0	4			1000-9515	1755-6724		WOS:000256549400024

Metabolic engineering communications				4				29	36		10.1016/j.meteno.2017.02.002				2017-Jun	2017	The ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) oxygenation reaction catalyzed by Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) is competing with carboxylation, being negative for both energy and carbon balances in photoautotrophic organisms. This makes RuBisCO one of the bottlenecks for oxygenic photosynthesis and carbon fixation. In this study, RuBisCO was overexpressed in the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803. Relative RuBisCO levels in the engineered strains FL50 and FL52 increased 2.1 times and 1.4 times, respectively, and both strains showed increased growth, photosynthesis and in vitro RuBisCO activity. The oxygen evolution rate increased by 54% and 42% on per chlorophyll basis, while the in vitro RuBisCO activity increased by 52% and 8.6%, respectively. The overexpressed RuBisCO were tagged with a FLAG tag, in strain FL50 on the N terminus of the large subunit while in strain FL52 on the C terminus of the small subunit. The presence of a FLAG tag enhanced transcription of the genes encoding RuBisCO, and, with high possibility, also enhanced the initiation of translation or stability of the enzyme. However, when using a streptavidin-binding tag II (strep-tag II), we did not observe a similar effect. Tagged RuBisCO offers an opportunity for further studying RuBisCO expression and stability. Increased levels of RuBisCO can further improve photosynthesis and growth in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 under certain growth conditions.									18	1	0	0	10	0	18				2214-0301		MEDLINE:29468130	29468130	
J	Mobin, M				Mobin, Mohammad/AAX-6438-2021	Mobin, Mohammad/0000-0003-4829-7491			High temperature interactions of metal oxides and carbides with ionic salts								SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS				8	5			257	273						1999	1999	Na2SO4 and NaCl are the two important ionic salts which are actively involved in inducing hot corrosion reactions. The aggressiveness of these salts towards superalloys at high temperatures is very well documented. Metallic carbides and/or oxides form the important constituents of high temperature materials; oxides are also integral constituents of protective scales formed on the superalloys. During hot corrosion reaction, these constituents react with molten Na2SO4 or molten NaCl to propagate the reaction. However, the chemistry of such hot corrosion reaction is not very well understood. This paper presents the results of important studies carried out on this subject in recent years.High temperature interactions of metal oxides, namely Co3O4, NiO, Al2O3, Cr2O3, Fe2O3, SiO2, TiO2, ZrO2, Nb2O5, Ta2O5, MoO3 and WO3, and carbides, namely Cr7C3, Fe3C, TiC, ZrC, NbC, TaC, MoC, WC, VC and HfC, separately with sodium sulphate (Na2SO4) and sodium chloride (NaCl) have been studied in the temperature range 900-1200K. At these temperatures, reaction kinetics (weight change vs time) and variation in weight with mole fraction of salt have been measured. The reaction products were identified by X-diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX). The formation of products was also investigated by thermodynamic computation of free energies of the reactions and the study of relevant equilibrium phase diagrams. The multiphase structures of the reaction products were studied by metallographic analysis. The solubility measurements of the reaction products were carried out to determine the soluble species in aqueous solutions. The weight losses during Interaction are interpreted in terms of evolution of gases like CO2/SO2 or Cl-2 or in some cases to volatilisation of oxide or chloride, whereas weight gains are explained in terms of the formation of sodium metal oxide, metal sulphide or metal chloride. The mechanism(s) of the high temperature interaction of metal oxides and carbides with Na2SO4 and NaCl has been discussed, and experimental evidence has been presented to support the proposed mechanism. In general, NaCl appears to be more reactive than Na2SO4.									4	0	0	0	0	1	4			0334-181X			WOS:000088187400003

These membranes were prepared using a counter diffusion method, resulting in the formation of an 80 mu m thick ZIF-8 layer on the outermost section of a porous so alumina capillary substrate. Single component gas permeation properties were investigated using helium, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen, methane, propylene, and propane at temperatures ranging from 298 to 363 K. The molecular sieve gas permeation properties of the ZIF-8 membranes increased with reaction time, which is consistent with the evolution of ZIF-8 crystal formation. The ZIF-8 membrane permeances of hydrogen and propylene reached 9.1 x 10(-8) and 2.5 x 10 (9) mol m (2) Pa (1), respectively. The ideal separation factors for hydrogen/propane and propylene/propane at 298 K were found to be 2000 and 59, respectively. The diffusion separation factor increased with decreasing temperature, reaching 23, while the solution separation factor remained 2.7. Therefore, the separation of propylene/propane was attributed to be mainly governed by diffusive separation.

Sn(ii) complex oxides are expected to offer such new possibilities. In this work, a quaternary (Sn-Ta-W-O) Tetragonal Tungsten Bronze type Sn(ii) oxide (Sn-TTB) and its photoanodes are reported for the first time. Results indicate that Sn-TTB has a bandgap of 1.85 eV with intense absorption up to 600 nm and the flat-band potential at -0.10 V vs. RHE. The IPCE of its photoanode is 10 times higher than that of the pyrochlore polymorph, owing to its better light absorption and higher carrier density. Experiments and calculations suggest strong interaction between Sn(ii) ions and the W/TaO6 skeleton, facilitating the delocalization of charge carriers. Such an exploration indicates that the structural engineering of Sn(ii) oxide may provide more exciting opportunities for solar energy conversion materials.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000695157300001

Senneca, R. Chirone, P. Salatino, L. Nappi, A. Nunziata, J. Anal. Appl. Pyrolysis, submitted for publication. [111 addressed the pattern and the kinetics of pyrolysis under inert versus oxidative conditions of several tobaccos and reported profound differences as regards the number of reaction steps, the rate, the temperature ranges and the yield in solid and gaseous products. The present paper investigates the effects of inert versus oxidative conditions on the composition of the gas produced.The experimental work consists of non-isothermal thermogravimetric experiments in connection with MS analysis. Experiments have been carried out in a Netzsch TG Skimmer apparatus that minimizes secondary reactions of primary decomposition products in the gas phase. MS profiles have been analyzed to underline the differences in the evolution of gaseous products under inert versus oxidizing conditions. Three different tobaccos have been tested, including omogenized and Kentucky tobaccos.A first analysis regarded the temperature at which chemical species are released. Results showed that most species of interest in tobacco smoke, in particular nitrogen containing species, are produced over quite broad temperature ranges under inert conditions and over much more limited ranges under oxidizing conditions. A second comparison regarded the cumulative amount of the species released. Also with this respect large differences have been observed when tobaccos are heated under inert or oxidative conditions. Some species, like CO, CO2, NOx and H2O, appear to be strongly favoured by oxidative conditions. Other species such as amines, H-2, aldehydes, aromatics and poliaromatics are instead favoured by inert conditions. Acrolein, HCN, butanone and nicotine are favoured by inert conditions for omogenized tobaccos and by oxidative conditions for Kentucky tobacco. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, a model to simulate the interaction between neighboring, strained thin flames is proposed, and is used to investigate the mechanism and impact of the interaction for the case of a methane-air flame described by a four-step reduced kinetics mechanism. In the model, the interaction between neighboring strained flames is simplified by combining them into a single stagnation-point flow structure with one of the major reactants trapped in the vicinity of the stagnation plane. We find that in both cases of flames converging toward the oxidizer or the fuel, the interaction does not occur until the reaction zones overlap. The difference between the two cases is caused by the deep penetration of oxygen into the fuel side in the former case as opposed to the rapid decomposition of the fuel as soon as the temperature rise is sufficiently high in the latter case. In both configurations, during the interaction phase, the burning rate increases as the hydrogen radical concentration rises due to the overlap of the two reaction zones, leading to a sudden termination of combustion as the trapped reactant is depleted, followed by an overshoot in the peak temperature. Thus, the interaction between neighboring flames is governed by chemical rather than thermal exchange. The burning enhancement in the first case is connected with the abundance of H in the last stages of oxygen consumption, while in the second case, it is due more to the burning of CO. Results also show that the after-extinction evolution of CO is quite different in two the cases. In the case of flames interacting across the oxidizer, the after-extinction dynamics of CO is similar to that of other major species, while for flames converging toward the fuel, CO after reaching levels higher than encountered in isolated flames, is rapidly consumed.

Here we report a comprehensive study on the oxidation reactions of rhodium clusters Rh-n(+/-) (n = 3- 30) and find that Rh3,4O4+, Rh5-7O6+, and Rh8-13O8+ always dominate the mass distributions showing size-dependent ladder oxygenation which is closely associated with the O-binding modes. While the Rh8-13O8+ clusters display a mu(3)-O binding mode (hollow site adsorption), Rh3-4O4+ and Rh5-7O6+ favor the mu(2)-O binding mode (edge-site adsorption) or a mixture of the two modes. The mu(3)-O binding mode is inclined to yield a cubic Rh13O8, while the mu(2)-O binding mode gives rise to oxygen-bridge protection for the metal clusters. Such ladder oxidation was also observed for Pt-n(+), Fe-n(+), Co-n(+), and Ni-n(+) clusters. We propose a three-dimensional diagram for the oxidation states and O-binding modes of metals, and highlight the metalloxocubes M13O8+ for cluster-genetic materials.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1948-7185			WOS:000743986200001	35025527

Current M-N-C (M: Fe, Co or Mn) catalysts are considered the most promising due to their encouraging performance. The challenge thus has been their stability under acidic conditions, which has hindered their use for any practical applications. In this review, based on the author's research experience in the field for more than 10 years, current challenges and possible solutions to overcome these problems were discussed. The current Edisonian approach (i.e., trial and error) to developing PGM-free catalysts has been ineffective in achieving revolutionary breakthroughs. Novel synthesis techniques based on a more methodological approach will enable atomic control and allow us to achieve optimal electronic and geometric structures for active sites uniformly dispersed within the 3D architectures. Structural and chemical controlled precursors such as metal-organic frameworks are highly desirable for making catalysts with an increased density of active sites and strengthening local bonding structures among N, C and metals. Advanced electrochemical and physical characterization, such as electron microscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy should be combined with first principle density functional theory (DFT) calculations to fully elucidate the active site structures.									67	3	0	0	2	0	66			2095-1701	2095-1698		WOS:000410770500007		
J	DePaolo, DJ; Getty, SR								Models of isotopic exchange in reactive fluid-rock systems: Implications for geochronology in metamorphic rock								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				60	20			3933	3947		10.1016/0016-7037(96)00215-3				OCT 1996	1996	A model is presented that describes diffusive isotopic redistribution in layered fluid-rock systems where the solid and fluid interact by solution-precipitation. The models lead to guidelines for sampling in metamorphic and diagenetically modified rocks that could substantially increase the probability of recovering desired geochronological and geochemical-information. The defining parameters of a fluid-rock system are the reaction rate, R, and the effective diffusivity (D-eff) of the chemical element in question, the latter a function of ionic diffusivity in the fluid, porosity, and the solid/fluid distribution coefficient. Reactive fluid-rock systems can be uniquely characterized in terms of a wavelength L = 2 pi(D-eff/R)(1/2), below which the local equilibrium approximation breaks down. The estimated values of L vary over several orders of magnitude depending on the element of interest and the conditions. For Sr in amphibolite facies metamorphic rocks, for example, L(Sr) is about 1-10 cm, whereas for lower greenschist or zeolite facies rocks L(Sr) may be 50 m. For oxygen in sedimentary rocks undergoing diagenesis, L(O) is greater than 1000 m. The premetamorphic isotopic structure of layered rocks can be conceptualized in terms of a Fourier series representation of isotope ratio vs. distance normal to layering. The effect of metamorphism is to alter the amplitude-wavelength spectrum of the isotopic ratio variations in the solid. Although, in the model transport in the fluid is solely by diffusion, the attenuation of the isotopic variations does not behave like diffusion at all wavelengths. In particular, at wavelengths smaller than L, the rate of isotopic homogenization is limited by the reaction rate rather than the wavelength. The large variability of Lin rock systems produces corresponding variability in the effects of isotopic redistribution. The implications of the models are discussed for whole rock and mineral isochrons, porphyroblast-matrix geochronology, and the retrieval of initial isotopic ratios from metamorphic rocks.									42	2	0	0	0	0	43			0016-7037			WOS:A1996VN49500014

The dependences of the film thickness, refractive index and optical gap, as well as the structural and compositional properties on the annealing temperature were studied. Three evolution stages with annealing temperature were observed. The first stage occurs below 400 degrees C, at which the film thickness expands, the refractive index reduces and the optical gap increases. The second stage sets in at around 400-500 degrees C and persists to a temperature of around 800 degrees C. At this stage, film thickness reduces, refractive index increases and the optical gap decreases. The third stage takes place at annealing temperatures above 800 degrees C, where the films become inhomogeneous from surface to interface due to oxidization. Stress relaxation, phase separation and oxidation mechanisms were correlated with the optical properties of the annealed films. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

TPO data indicated the presence of two carbon species with different oxidation reactivity in all the materials prepared from both anthracites. The influence of the heat treatment temperature on the evolution and structure of different carbon species was evaluated by using both the TPO data and the XRD parameters. The less ordered (more reactive) carbon species were gradually converted into the more ordered (less reactive) species by increasing the heat treatment temperature, thus, giving rise to the formation of materials with a higher overall degree of graphitic order as determined by XRD. Within the set of materials prepared from one of the anthracites (ATO), a consistent relationship was found between the oxygen reactivity of the carbons species and the treatment temperature in the range of 2300-2600 degrees C. In addition, there was also a good correlation between the proportion of the more reactive carbon component in the materials and their XRD parameters (particularly L.). (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

These processes are facilitated by a hydrogen-bonded network of amino acid residues and waters surrounding the OEC. It is crucial to probe the proton-transfer pathways from the OEC as proton release helps to maintain the charge balance required for efficient water oxidation. In this study, we generate point mutations in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 at secondary-shell amino acid residues surrounding the OEC: D2-K317, D1-S169, CP43-R357, D1-D61, and D1-N181. We employ direct experimental methods to study the O-2 evolution rate under varying pH ranging from 3-8. The pH dependence follows a bell-shaped curve in both wild-type and mutated PSII from which we can derive the effective acidic pK(a). The effective acidic pK(a) provides insights into the protonation states of the amino acid residues participating in the proton-transfer process during the rate-determining step of water oxidation. The presence of an additional effective pK(a) in D1-S169A PSII and D2-K317A PSII indicates the possibility of multiple proton-transfer pathways during the ratedetermining step of water oxidation. We also studied the O-2 evolution rate in H2O and D2O with varying pL (L = H or D) to identify the amino acid residues participating in the proton-transfer process. We find that replacing the positively charged lysine with a neutral alanine in D2-K317A PSII and aspartate with alanine in D1-D6IA PSII significantly enhances the kinetic solvent isotope effect (KSIE), indicating that proton transfer becomes rate-limiting at the optimal pH in these mutated PSII. However, the KSIE remains unchanged for D1-N181A, D1-S169A, and CP43-R357K PSII. Thus, perturbing the channel defined by the D1-D61 and D2-K317 residues strongly hampers the proton-transfer mechanism, and in turn, the water oxidation reaction of PSII. Hence, our study provides a direct experimental probe to identify that the D1-D61 and D2-K317 residues participate in the proton-transfer process. These results, thereby, provide us a deeper understanding of the proton-transfer processes in the water oxidation mechanism.									14	0	0	0	9	0	14			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000489086200005	31496245

The pendant imidazole ligand plays a crucial role not only to provide an imidazolinium proton for proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) from [(L-1)Co-II] to O-2 in the presence of HOTf but also to facilitate electron transfer (ET) from [(L-1)Co-II] to O-2 in the absence of HOTf. The kinetics analysis and the detection of intermediates in the stoichiometric and catalytic reduction of O-2 have provided clues to clarify the crucial roles of the pendant imidazole ligand of [(L-1)Co-II] for the first time.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000823863000001	35730106	
J	Fedonkin, M. A.								Eukaryotization of the Early Biosphere: A Biogeochemical Aspect								GEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL				47	13			1265	1333		10.1134/S0016702909130011				DEC 2009	2009	The synthesis of data on the paleobiology and geochemistry of the Archean and Proterozoic and the ecology, biochemistry, and comparative genomics of living organisms provides a means for reconstructing the development of biological complexity on the subcell, organism, and ecosystem levels. The conditions and time of the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis, eukaryotic cells, and multicellular animals were determined. These evolutionary events had a profound influence on the global biogeochemical cycles, sedimentogenesis, and climate of the Earth. Irreversible geochemical changes in the biosphere and the biochemical evolution of living systems are described as complementary processes. A decrease in hydrogen concentration in the early biosphere, an increase in oxygen concentration in the ocean, and changes in the bioavailability of metals (Fe, Ni, Co, V, W, Cu, Mo, etc.) known as enzyme activators were considered as key factors of eukaryotization. The reasons for variations in the availability of the metals in the biosphere were distinguished. The continuity of life was maintained owing to the preservation of the functionality of archaic metabolism types through the compartmentalization of biochemical reactions and the complication of cellular metabolic networks. The metabolic cascades of living cells probably recapitulate this prolonged evolutionary process. The exhaustion of abiogenic hydrogen sources stimulated the symbiosis of hydrogen-producing and hydrogen-consuming prokaryotes and the involvement of simple hydrogen-bearing volatile compounds (CH4, NH3, H2S, and, finally, H2O) as a substrate for life, which eventually predefined the chemical composition of the terrestrial atmosphere strongly dominated by nitrogen and oxygen as by-products of exchange reactions. The oxygenation of the ocean diminished the mobility and bioavailability of some metals that had served as the earliest enzyme activators. The evolutionary response to this process was the formation of mechanisms of extraction, accumulation, and the retention of ancient activator metals (e. g., Fe, W, and Ni) in the cell and in the ecosystem, as well as the active involvement of new metals (e. g., Mo, Cu, and Zn). Oceanic biota became the main concentrator and reservoir for these metals. The appearance of eukaryotic cells, the increasing role of heterotrophy, an increase in biodiversity, the complication of trophic relationships, the acceleration of the cycle of biophile elements, and other features of the biosphere eukaryotization were to large extent a response to the narrowing of the geochemical basis of life. A pivotal point in the prolonged process of biosphere eukaryotization was a series of glaciations at the end of the Proterozoic (750-540 Ma) and the active oxygenation of the ocean, which enabled the global expansion of eukaryotic organisms.									8	0	0	0	3	0	9			0016-7029	1556-1968		WOS:000275527200001

Both the whole chain as well as the PSII mediated electron transfer were inhibited by mercury, whereas the rates of PSI remained unaffected. In mercury-treated cells a sudden rise in fluorescence emission to the F-m level as seen in 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) treated cells was observed. In the presence of DCMU, mercury treatment decreased the yield of fluorescence emission. The thermoluminescence studies showed that charge recombination between the positively charged Sp and negatively charged Q(A)(-) of PSII remained unaffected up to 100 mu M Hg2+, but the S2OB- charge recombination was largely inhibited by this treatment. Furthermore, the B-band was shifted to a lower temperature (16 degrees C) by Hg2+, similar to that seen in DCMU treated cells. These results suggested that Hg2+ inhibits PSII at different sites at both the donor side (partially at the water splitting system and reaction centres of PSII) and acceptor side by blocking electron flow between the primary and secondary quinine accepters.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0011-4529			WOS:000081745700003

Oxygen is therefore likely the critical variable determining the healing capabilities of any tissue. Significant advances in the understanding of cutaneous wound healing progressed with advances in the measurement of tissue PO2, which has advanced over the past several decades from implantable probes to now include molecular tools such as the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). HIF-1 modulates the expression of genes that drive the cellular adaptive response to hypoxia and possess the HIF-1 binding sequence named hypoxic response element within their promoter sequence. Molecular biology techniques are now allowing exploitation of the HIF-1/hypoxia response element pathway to drive the expression of potential vulnerary ectopic genes. Here we show the utility of the hypoxia response element for hypoxia-driven expression of the transforming growth factor-beta-signaling component Smad3 in vitro and the in vivo detection of ischemic hypoxia using luciferase. Smad3 is a positive effector of transforming growth factor-beta superfamily signal transduction. Such approaches are the latest evolution of work championed by Hunt and colleagues over the past 4 decades.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			1067-1927			WOS:000186779200019	14617292

These samples were submitted to chemical structural analysis such as solid-state C-13 NMR and infrared spectroscopies, solvent swelling, selective oxidation, and estimation of the amount of transferable hydrogen, and thermogravimetric analysis. Inertinite-rich fractions ("A" samples) from both coals, which have little fluidity in a plastic range, have larger size of aromatic cluster, lesser amounts of substituents (alkyl- and oxygen functional groups) on aromatic rings, and higher density of cross-linking than vitrinite-rich fractions ("B" samples: higher fluidity) of same coal. For the appearance of high fluidity, relatively much aliphatic chains and bridges with WIT-B and branched aliphatic moieties and alicyclic parts with GNY-B sample, respectively, seem to be requisite, along with low aromaticity, much transferable hydrogen and high swelling index. Effective tar evolution took place in "B" sample between maximum fluidity temperature (MFT) and resolidification temperature (RT), while it occurred after RT in the case of "A" samples, these findings being parallel with observation reported previously. The authors rationalized these phenomena in terms of chemical reactions occurred during heat treatment.									38	3	0	0	0	0	41			0887-0624			WOS:000178122100029

However, the undesirable structural evolution and oxygen redox impose great challenge on the cycling stability and rate capability of such cathodes. In this work, it is reported that Fe and Al can effectively tailor the Na2/3Mn2/3Fe1/6Al1/6O2 to trigger a stable cationic and anionic redox behavior. In situ X-ray diffraction analysis confirms the retention of a stable P2 phase upon cycling, and density functional theory results demonstrate that Al3+ doping can strengthen the covalency of Mn-O bond. The Na2/3Mn2/3Fe1/6Al1/6O2 cathode can retain 90% of its initial capacity within the voltage range of 2.0-4.2 V versus Na+/Na at 200 mA g(-1) after 100 cycles. Moreover, ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that the specific capacity can be replenished by the synergistic reactions between Fe3+/Fe4+/Fe3+ and O2-/(O-2)(n)(-) pairs within the voltage range of 4.0-4.4 V versus Na+/Na, which is also elucidated by theoretical calculation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000797226500001	35585688

Under neutral-to-alkaline conditions, first-row transitionmetal oxides/(oxy)hydroxides are the fastest-known OER catalysts and have been the subject of intense study for the past decade. Critical to their high performance is the intentional or accidental addition of Fe to Ni/Co oxides that convert to layered (oxy)hydroxide structures during the OER. Unraveling the role that Fe plays in the catalysis and the molecular identity of the true "active site" has proved challenging, however, due to the dynamics of the host structure and absorbed Fe sites as well as the diversity of local structures in these disordered active phases.In this Account, we highlight our work to understand the role of Fe in Ni/Co (oxy)hydroxide OER catalysts. We first discuss how we characterize the intrinsic activity of the first-row transition-metal (oxy)hydroxide catalysts as thin films by accounting for the contributions of the catalyst-layer thickness (mass loading) and electrical conductivity as well as the underlying substrate's chemical interactions with the catalyst and the presence of Fe species in the electrolyte. We show how Fe-doped Ni/Co (oxy)hydroxides restructure during catalysis, absorb/desorb Fe, and in some cases degrade or regenerate their activity during electrochemical testing. We highlight the relevant techniques and procedures that allowed us to better understand the role of Fe in activating other first-row transition metals for OER. We find several modes of Fe incorporation in Ni/Co (oxy)hydroxides and show how those modes correlate with activity and durability. We also discuss how this understanding informs the incorporation of earthabundant transition-metal OER catalysts in anion-exchange-membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWE) that provide a locally basic anode environment but run on pure water and have advantages over the more-developed proton-exchange-membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE) that use platinum-group-metal (PGM) catalysts. We outline the key issues of introducing Fe-doped Ni/Co (oxy)hydroxide catalysts at the anode of the AEMWE, such as the oxidative processes triggered by Fe species traveling through the polymer membrane, pH-gradient effects on the catalyst stability, and possibly limited catalyst utilization in the compressed stack configuration. We also suggest possible mitigation strategies for these issues. Finally, we summarize remaining challenges including the long-term stability of Fe-doped Ni/Co (oxy)hydroxides under OER conditions and the lack of accurate models of the dynamic active surface that hinder our understanding of, and thus ability to design, these catalysts.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18				2643-6728		WOS:000677583500008

Success in this area of research will transcend the current bottleneck for the development of energy-conversion schemes based on sunlight.

Moreover, overall water splitting is realized by a Z-scheme system combining STO:La/Rh HoMSs with BiVO4 (BVO) nanosheets with 1 wt% Pt as the co-catalyst. Steady evolution of hydrogen and oxygen is performed under both visible light and simulated sunlight irradiation.

Iridium based nano materials are less studied than metals like gold, silver or platinum. A specific feature of iridium nanomaterials is the relatively small size nanoparticles and clusters easily obtained, e.g. by colloidal syntheses. Progress over the years overcomes the related challenging characterization and it is expected that the knowledge on iridium chemistry and nanomaterials will be growing. Although Ir nanoparticles have been preferred systems for the development of kinetic-based models of nanomaterial formation, there is surprisingly little knowledge on the actual formation mechanism(s) of iridium nanoparticles. Following the impulse from the high expectations on Ir nanoparticles as catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction in electrolyzers, new areas of applications of iridium materials have been reported while more established applications are being revisited. This review covers different synthetic strategies of iridium nanoparticles and provides an in breadth overview of applications reported. Comprehensive Tables and more detailed topic-oriented overviews are proposed in Supplementary Material, covering synthesis protocols, the historical role or iridium nanoparticles in the development of nanoscience and applications in catalysis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0001-8686	1873-3727		WOS:000788072200003	35334351

To date, the mode of action of AMT in plant cells remains unknown. Our experimental results indicate that AMT causes leaf lesion attributed to its multiple effects on PSII. AMT decreases the O-2 evolution rate of PSII. Based on chlorophyll fluorescence data, similar to the classical herbicide diuron, AMT interrupts PSII electron transfer beyond QA at the acceptor side, leading to the inactivation of the PSII reaction centers. Additionally, AMT decreases chlorophyll content and destroys the architecture of PSII pigment assemblies. However, AMT does not affect the oxygen-evolving complex at the donor side of PSII. Thus, it is concluded that AMT is a natural photosynthetic inhibitor with several action sites in PSII.									5	1	0	0	4	0	6			0300-3604	1573-9058		WOS:000524480200018

Therefore to design synthetic genetic networks and circuits, precise control of RNA synthesis rates is of the utmost importance. Often, however, a native promoter does not exist that has the precise characteristics required for a given application. Here, we describe two methods to change the rates and regulation of RNA synthesis in cells to create RNA synthesis of a desired specification. First, error-prone PCR is discussed for diversifying the properties of native promoters, that is, changing the rate of synthesis in constitutive promoters and the induction properties for an inducible promoter. Specifically, we describe techniques for generating diversified promoter libraries of the constitutive promoters P(L)tetO-1 in Escherichia coli and TEF1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as the inducible, oxygen-repressed promoter DAN1 in S. cerevisiae. Beyond generating promoter libraries, we discuss techniques to quantify the parameters of each new promoter. Promoter characteristics for each promoter in hand, the designer can then pick and choose the promoters needed for the specific genetic circuit described in silico. Second, Chemically Induced Chromosomal Evolution (CIChE) is presented as an alternative method to finely adjust RNA synthesis rates in E. coli by variation of gene cassette copy numbers in tandem gene arrays. Both techniques result in precisely defined RNA synthesis and should be of great utility in synthetic biology.									14	0	0	0	12	0	14			0076-6879		978-0-12-385075-1	WOS:000291321200006	21601085

Previous studies have demonstrated that a NiFeOOH overlayer on the alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode enhances the photoelectrochemical performance; however, the mechanism underlying this improvement remains poorly understood. In this paper, we report on how the NiFeOOH overlayer affects the energetics of the photoanode and the kinetics of surface charge carriers as a function of NiFeOOH thickness. It was found that a thin NiFeOOH film not only reduced surface charge recombination but also increased the water oxidation kinetics. This result is in conflict with earlier studies asserting that surface modification of semiconductor electrodes with oxide-based electrocatalysts does not affect the water oxidation kinetics. The distinctive dual-function character of the NiFeOOH overlayer arises from the combination of the remarkable catalytic activity of NiFeOOH and the properties of photo-assisted electrodeposition. However, thick NiFeOOH films lead to a substantial decrease in photocurrent owing to the low conductivity of the segregated FeOOH phase in the film.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2398-4902			WOS:000611818900018

In addition to stress-temperature measurements, resistance-temperature investigations and chemical and microstructural characterization by Auger electron spectroscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and atomic force microscopy were also carried out. The films are polycrystalline with a grain size of 20 nm up to 450 degrees C. To explain the stress evolution above 120 degrees C, atomic rearrangement (excess-vacancy annihilation, grain-boundary relaxation, and shrinkage of grain-boundary voids) and oxidation were considered. Grain-boundary relaxation was found to be the dominating process up to 250-300 degrees C. A sharp transition from compressive to tensile stress between 300 and 380 degrees C is explained by the formation of a NiO surface layer due to reaction with the remaining oxygen in the Ar atmosphere. This oxidation is masking the inherent structural relaxation above 300 degrees C.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0884-2914			WOS:000082550400021

The surface morphology, phase composition and electrochemical properties of the particle electrode were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and electrochemical workstation. The results show that the Sn/Sb-Mn-GAC particles have uniform grain size, good dispersity and high oxygen evolution potential. The Sn/Sb-Mn-GAC particle electrode was used to the electrochemical degradation of 4-chlorophenol. It was shown that 4-chlorophenol was almost completely removed after electrolyzing for 60 min. A large number of intermediates were produced during the degradation of 4-chlorophenol in the experimental system. The main intermediate products were benzoquinone, 4-chlorocatechol, hydroquinone, fumaric acid, oxalic acid, etc., eventually mineralized into water and carbon dioxide. The degradation pathway of 4-chlorophenol were preliminarily suggested through the analysis of intermediates in degradation process. The supported Sn/Sb-Mn-GAC particle electrode can be repeated used 4 times in three-dimensional electrochemical reactor and the kinetic model for the electrochemical oxidation of 4-chlorophenol was established. The experimental results show that the degradation process of 4-chlorophenol accords with the first-order kinetic model, the correlation coefficient is 0.98 or more. The kinetic rate constant k of Sn/Sb-Mn-GAC particle electrode is reduced when it is repeated used, but the treatment efficiency of 4-chlorophenol is still better. The results of research show that the three-dimensional electrochemical reactor using Sn/Sb-Mn-GAC particle electrode has promising application prospects in the treatment of phenolic wastewater.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1063-455X	1934-936X		WOS:000600769200004

Taking phenol as target organics, the electrochemical performance of the electrode was investigated. Polarization curves and Mott-Schottky curve of the prepared electrodes were tested, and the results show that the oxygen evolution potential of lanthanum modified Ti/Sb-SnO(2 )electrode first increases and then decreases. And the exchange current density of Sn:Sb:La=100:10:1.5 electrode is maximum under potential of 2.0 V. The La doping promotes the negative shift of flat band potential and the slope of fitting straight-line of Mott-Schottky curve falls from 2.96 to 1.66, enhancing the active surface area, and improving the carrier concentration correspondingly. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of prepared electrodes were performed; the results indicate that the electrochemical reaction resistance of the doped electrode decreases, and the active charge increases from 14.1 mu F to 322 mu F. At the same time, the peak current of the direct oxidation of phenol increases, and the peak potential decreases. The above results explain the intrinsic reason for the improvement of the electrocatalytic activity.									5	2	0	0	0	0	6			1002-185X			WOS:000444219500026

By using an inert intermetallic anode, the CO(2) evolution can be eliminated altogether with acceleration in the electro-reduction kinetics. At present the process suffers from slow reduction kinetics of TiO(2) to Ti metal, which can be enhanced significantly by the incorporation of alkali species in die TiO(2) pellet at the cathode and in the CaCl(2) bath in the presence of an intermetallic inert anode. Nearly full metallization with greater than 99% of Ti metal containing 1500 ppm of oxygen is possible to achieve in less than 16 hours of electro-reduction. Analyses of phase composition and the microstructures morphology in fully metallized pellets revealed the presence of localized solidified Ti layer, indicating that fast reduction process also involved formation of liquid phase as middle stage reaction. In addition, in situ creation of porosity and maintain higher current level during electrolysis process were two key factors to fully reduction of TiO(2).

The compound was studied with single-crystal X-ray diffraction and wide-line H-1 NMR spectroscopy. The building blocks of the compound are formed by [Re4Te4(CN)(12)](4-) cluster anions linked through {Lu(H2O)(6)}(3+) cationic complexes in infinite linear chains. The chains form a quasi 1-D structure with channels occupied with oxygen-protonated ensembles. A temperature variation triggers a two-stage evolution of intermolecular proton exchange corresponding to activation energies of 16 and 43 kJ/mol. The stages are interpreted as a step-by-step process of the solvate and coordinate water molecules becoming involved in the proton-transfer reactions. It was hypothesized that the mechanism of proton exchange includes the Grotthuss-type proton translocation in the protonated water fragments and the continual rearrangement of protonated and unprotonated fragments in the structure channels due to H2O molecular diffusion.									16	0	2	0	0	0	18			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000248121600039

Perovskite material was obtained after calcination of gels in air at temperature of 800 degrees C for 3 hours. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed the formation of perovskite phase for all x=0-0.8. The XRD line broadening analysis showed that particle size of LSM decreased from 100 nm to 28-50 nm by doping of Mg from x=0-0.8. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of sintered pellets of LSMMg produced at x =0-0.8 in 0.5M KOH solution represented the increased adsorption of hydroxyl ions in perovskite structure. The results suggest that LSMMg (x=0.5) perovksite is promising anode material for alkaline fuel cells as it can promote oxygen evolution reaction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ATCC 51142 (Cyanothece 51142) is able to grow aerobically under nitrogen-fixing conditions with alternating light-dark cycles or continuous illumination. This study investigated the effects of carbon and nitrogen sources on Cyanothece 51142 metabolism via C-13-assisted metabolite analysis and biochemical measurements. Under continuous light (50 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) and nitrogen-fixing conditions, found that glycerol addition promoted aerobic biomass growth (by twofold) and nitrogenase dependent hydrogen production [up to 25 mu mol H-2 (mg chlorophyll)(-1) h(-1)], but strongly reduced phototrophic CO2 utilization Under nitrogen-sufficient conditions, Cyanothece 51142 was able to metabolize glycerol photoheterotrophically, and the activity of light-dependent reactions (e.g oxygen evolution) was not significantly reduced In contrast, Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 showed apparent mixotrophic metabolism under similar growth conditions. Isotopomer analysis also detected that Cyanothece 51142 was able to fix CO2 via anaplerotic pathways, and to take up glucose and pyruvate for mixotrophic biomass synthesis.									59	1	0	0	52	1	60			1350-0872	1465-2080		WOS:000281239600029	20430816

In this work, we used a tungsten microelectrode to measure the interfacial pH change near the surface of an aluminium alloy (AA2024) during the formation of two conversion coatings: (i) a trivalent chromium pretreatment (TCP) and (ii) a Ti-based, non-chromium-containing coating. The tungsten microelectrode exhibited an open circuit potential (OCP) that changed linearly as a function of the solution pH with a slope of -64 mV per pH. The microelectrode was positioned near the AA2024-T3 surface and its potential was measured as a function of time along with the OCP of the alloy sample during formation of the two coatings. The microelectrode exhibited a negative shift in potential immediately upon initiation of the coating formation, consistent with a significant increase in the interfacial pH of 2-6 units depending on the coating system. The pH increase is attributed to proton-consuming cathodic reactions that occur on the alloy surface once the passivating oxide layer is dissolved: hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction. The increased pH causes the hydrolysis of the soluble fluorometalate precursor species in the baths, which precipitate forming a hydrated metal oxide coating (e. g., ZrO2 center dot nH(2)O).									71	5	0	0	0	0	76			0003-2654	1364-5528		WOS:000321152300025	23739139

Understanding the detailed surface and bulk redox processes of Ni-rich NMC can provide useful insights into material design options to boost reversible capacity and cycle life. Both hard X-ray absorption (XAS) of metal K-edges and soft XAS of metal L-edges collected from charged LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC622) and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) showed that the charge capacity up to removing similar to 0.7 Li/f.u. was accompanied with Ni oxidation in bulk and near the surface (up to 100 nm). Of significance to note is that nickel oxidation is primarily responsible for the charge capacity of NMC622 and 811 up to similar lithium removal (similar to 0.7 Li/f.u.) albeit charged to different potentials, beyond which was followed by Ni reduction near the surface (up to 100 nm) due to oxygen release and electrolyte parasitic reactions. This observation points toward several new strategies to enhance reversible redox capacities of Ni-rich and/or Co-free electrodes for high-energy Li-ion batteries.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000600202300030	33283495

Electrodes with dual-layer coating for alkaline water electrolysis were deposited on Ni-coated perforated substrates. Microstructure and morphology were studied by SEM. Element content was measured by EDS. Enthalpy probe was employed for measuring plasma temperature and velocity as well as the gas composition. For verifying and better understanding the shrouding effect numerical calculation was carried out according to the experimental settings. Electrochemical test was carried out to validate the shrouding effect. The results showed slight protecting effect of gas shrouding on plasma plume and the final coating. Over the dual-layer section, the measured oxygen fraction was 3.46 and 3.15% for the case without gas shrouding and with gas shrouding, respectively. With gas shrouding the coating exhibited similar element contents as the coating sprayed by VPS, while no obvious improvement was observed in the microstructure or the morphology. Evident electrochemical improvement was nevertheless achieved that with gas shrouding the electrode exhibited similar performance as that of the VPS-sprayed electrode.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1059-9630	1544-1016		WOS:000419001600005

In this research, the formation of multilayered 3D porous structures was performed by mixing Co3O4 and TiO2 nanopowders with adding pore-forming agents and further calcination. Different crystallite sizes of porous CoTiO3 were produced by varying the calcination temperature. The fabricated 3D porous CoTiO3 were characterized using XRD, SEM, BET, optical measuring technique. The crystallite size increases with increasing the calcination temperature within the range of 600-800 degrees C. The photocatalytic activity of 3D porous CoTiO3 was studied by measuring the rate of H-2 evolution during the splitting in 0.5 M KOH aqueous solution electrolyte under 300 mW/cm(2) xenon lamp irradiation. The SEM images and BET analysis show that an increase in the calcination temperature leads to a decrease of porosity CoTiO3 due to the agglomeration of particles. The change in values of potential and current of CoTiO3 depending on the dark and light conditions showed a certain extent under the light, which is mainly reflected in the drop of the initial voltage, and the hydrogen evolution reaction occurs under the-0.2 V bias voltage. The measured rate of hydrogen production of 3D porous CoTiO3 showed for UV irradiation of 0.3 mmol/g-h and for visible light 0.024 mmol/g-h, respectively. Gas chromatography analysis shows a 13% higher amount of hydrogen production for 3D porous CoTiO3 sample calcined at 800 degrees C, than at 600 degrees C. The results of current work not only report but also put forward a strategy of applied advantages the 3D CoTiO3 porous material for efficient visible-light photocatalytic reduction of hydrogen.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1369-8001	1873-4081		WOS:000585289900001

Subsequently, 7YSZ nano-ceramic coating was produced on bond coating as top coating. Al film was deposited on the surface of TBC samples. Then the Al-deposited TBCs were carried out by heat-treatment at different pressures (200, 250, 300 Pa). After that, the thermal shock tests of as-sprayed and Al-modified 7YSZ nano-TBC were taken from 1050 degrees C. to atmospheric water with holding time of 10 and 5 min, respectively. Micrograph and microstructure evolution of the TBC sample were characterized before and after thermal shock. The results show that a loose top layer with Al nano-grains is formed on the TBC surface due to evaporation and condensation of Al film at vacuum pressure. Besides, with increase of heat-treatment pressure, the density of loose layer is increased. A dense Al2O3 layer was in-situ synthesized under the loose layer due to the reaction of Al and ZrO2. The Al-modified 7YSZ nano-TBCs heat-treated at different pressures has less spallation area than the as-sprayed TBCs after withstood 73 thermal shocks, showing better thermal shock resistance.									5	5	0	0	0	0	8			1000-324X			WOS:000410602400013

Yet, hematite nanowires thermally annealed at high temperature suffer from two major drawbacks that negatively affect their performance. First, the structural deformation reduces light absorption capability of nanowire. Second, this "passive" doping method leads to nonuniform distribution of Sn dopant in nanowire and limits the Sn doping concentration. Both factors impair the electrochemical properties of hematite nanowire. Here we demonstrate a silica encapsulation method that is able to simultaneously retain the hematite nanowire morphology even after high-temperature calcination at 800 degrees C and improve the concentration and uniformity of dopant distribution along the nanowire growth axis. The capability of retaining nanowire morphology allows tuning the nanowire length for optimal light absorption. Uniform distribution of Sn doping enhances the donor density and charge transport of hematite nanowire. The morphology and doping engineered hematite nanowire photoanode decorated with a cobalt oxide-based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst achieves an outstanding photocurrent density of 2.2 mA cm(-2) at 0.23 V vs Ag/AgCl. This work provides important insights on how the morphology and doping uniformity of hematite photoanodes affect their PEC performance.									168	10	0	0	13	1	170			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000399354500056	28334530

Herein, a one-step and facile Pd2+-assisted soft-templating strategy is reported to synthesize ordered mesoporous Ni spheres (OMNiS) with highly uniform and tunable diameters. In this synthesis methodology, lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs) are used as a meso-structural template and Pd nuclei obtained from the reduction of Pd2+ ions are used as nucleation sites for directing Ni deposition. The OMNiS samples with average sphere diameter ranging from 50 nm to 190 nm are produced by varying the amount of Pd2+ in the LLC precursor, revealing that the Pd nuclei play a key role in improving the uniformity of the mesoporous Ni spheres and adjusting the sphere diameter. The satisfactory combination of uniform sphere size, high surface area, great conductivity, and highly ordered mesoporous structure for the optimal OMNiS-100 sample contributes to its superior electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline electrolyte with a low overpotential of 271 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is much smaller than that of RuO2 (368 mV), along with a remarkable durability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000813744200001	35718937

Its assembly involves binding and light-driven oxidation of manganese, a process denoted as photoactivation. The disassembly of the Mn complex is a thermally activated process involving distinct intermediates. Starting from intermediate states of the disassembly, which was initiated by a temperature jump to 47 degrees C, we photoactivated PSII membrane particles and monitored the activity recovery by O-2 polarography and delayed chlorophyll fluorescence measurements. Oxidation state and structural features of the formed intermediates of the Mn complex were assayed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Mn K-edge. The photoactivation time courses, which exhibit a lag phase characteristic of intermediate formation only when starting with the apo-PSII, suggest that within similar to 5 min of photoactivation of apo-PSII, a binuclear Mn complex is formed. It is proposed that a Mn-2(III)(di-mu-oxo) complex is a key intermediate both in the disassembly and in the assembly reaction paths.									38	0	0	0	23	0	38			0006-2960			WOS:000242340200029	17128991

For metal-air batteries,cobalt-based electrocatalysts such as simple oxides,spinel oxides,perovskite oxides,and others can significantly improve the discharge capacity and cycle life,and simultaneously,lower the charge voltage and polarization.On the other hand,the catalytic activity and stability need to be further enhanced,and the catalytic mechanisms and active sites deserve further rational exploration and ascertainment.Similarly,cobalt-based electrocatalysts including La_(1-x)Sr_xCoO_(3-delta),La_(1-x)Sr_xCo_(1-y)Fe_yO_(3-delta), Ba_(1-x)Sr_xCo_yFe_(1-y)O_(3-delta)and cobalt-based double perovskites show evident efficacy in reducing the cathode polarization resistance and area specific resistance as well as increasing the power density,while nonetheless sustaining agenerally higher thermal expansion coefficient and a rather poor stability compared to some other competitors. To further improve the catalytic performance of cobalt-based electrocatalysts for metal-air batteries and intermediate-low temperature solid oxide fuel cells,researchers have developed many useful and productive methods,exemplified by metal elements doping, composite cathode materials preparation,and noble metals decoration. This review provides a brief introduction of the structure and working principle of metal-air batteries and intermediate-low temperature solid oxide fuel cells,and a vivid description upon the latest attempts and achievements for the fabrication,modification and performance of the rich variety of cobalt-based electrocatalysts,mainly including simple oxides,perovskites oxides,spinel oxides and double perovskites.			在21世纪的今天,由石油、煤炭等化石资源的过度开发与使用所引发的能源和环境问题日趋严重,开发经济、高效的能源转换与存储装置已成为新时代的研究主题。金属-空气电池和中低温固体氧化物燃料电池,作为高效的能源转换与存储装置,可以实现化学能向电能的高效转换,具有效率高、环境友好、成本低的显著优点,在过去十几年内受到了研究者的广泛关注,取得了惊人的成果。但与此同时,人们在研究中发现阴极(正极)缓慢的氧还原和氧析出反应速率极大地降低了电池转换效率,增加了应用成本,在很大程度上制约了金属-空气电池和中低温固体氧化物燃料电池的商业化发展和应用。钴基催化剂作为一种高效阴极材料,相比贵金属成本较低,且具有混合离子-电子导电性,可以有效降低极化电阻,对阴极氧还原和氧析出反应显示出高催化活性,近年来吸引了国内外学者极大的研究兴趣。对于金属-空气电池,虽然钴基催化剂如钴氧化物、尖晶石型氧化物、钙钛矿型氧化物等材料能够显著地提高金属-空气电池的电容量和循环性能,并且降低充电电压,有效降低极化,但是其催化活性和稳定性有待提高,催化机理和活性位点也需要进一步明确和探究;对于中低温固体氧化物燃料电池,钴基催化剂包括La_(1-x)Sr_xCoO_(3-delta)、La_(1-x)Sr_xCo_(1-y)Fe_yO_(3-delta)、Ba_(1-x)Sr_xCo_yFe_(1-y)O_(3-delta)和钴基双钙钛矿等材料可以大大降低阴极极化电阻和面积比电阻,提高功率密度,但是相对其他催化剂,热膨胀系数普遍较高,稳定性也较差。为了进一步提高钴基催化剂应用在金属-空气电池和中低温固体氧化物燃料电池中的催化活性,研究者采用了掺杂其他金属元素、与其他物质组成复合阴极材料以及贵金属修饰等方法,在很大程度上提高了这两种电池的性能。本文简要介绍了金属-空气电池和中低温固体氧化物燃料电池的结构、工作原理,并在此基础上着重评述了近年来面向这两种能源转换与存储器件的,包括钴氧化物、钙钛矿型氧化物、尖晶石型氧化物和双钙钛矿氧化物等在内的各种钴基电催化剂的制取、改性和性能研究探索与成果。						1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1005-023X			CSCD:6186212		
J	Zhao, Yuqiong; He, Shouqi; Guo, Qingxiang; Li, Guoqiang; Wang, Liping; Liu, Yunbo; Zhang, Yongfa								Role of FeS Catalyst in the Hydromodification of Lignite in a Subcritical Water-CO System								ACS OMEGA				6	32			21160	21168		10.1021/acsomega.1c03120		AUG 2021		AUG 17 2021	2021	The impacts of FeS catalysts on the hydromodification and structural evolution of lignite were investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results indicate that the caking property of lignite can be significantly improved in the presence of the FeS catalyst. When 6.0 wt % FeS was added, the maximum caking index (G(RI)) of modified coal reached 95. During the hydromodification, FeS has little effect on the intrinsic water gas shift reaction, but it can increase the CO conversion by promoting the decomposition and hydrogenation of coal so that more active hydrogen is generated and introduced into modified coal. FeS is conducive to the rupture of distal aliphatic groups in the extractible solutes, which promotes the entrance of hydrogen into the aromatic nucleus (H-ar) and alpha positions (H-alpha) of asphaltenes and beta positions (H-beta) of preasphaltenes. After the catalytic hydromodification, the longer side chains or bridge bonds break and are hydrogenated to form the aliphatic structures with a shorter chain or a higher branched degree. Meanwhile, more oxygen-containing functional groups were removed along with the reduction of volatiles in the modified coal. The synergistic effect of FeS on these factors is favorable for the generation of plastic materials, which contributes to the development of the caking property of lignite.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-1343			WOS:000687058800045	34423224

The structural and chemical stability of the as-deposited oxide nanocrystals were investigated using wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The rock salt-spinel structural transformation occurred in the oxide nanocrystals annealed at a temperature of 500 degrees C. A cubic Fd (3) over barm spinel-type structure was obtained in the Co-rich, Mn-Co-O oxide nanocrystals, while a distorted tetragonal-type spinel phase with a space group of I4(1)/amd, induced by the Jahn-Teller effect, formed in their Mn-rich counterparts. It is noted that the structural transformation involves the migration of Mn/Co cations from the octahedral interstices to the tetrahedral interstices, which is accompanied by the reduction of Mn/Co cations and oxygen evolution. A novel mechanism for the structural transformation and reaction scheme is proposed in this work.									140	4	0	0	7	0	143			0897-4756			WOS:000253727400045

The PbOx/Pb anode was prepared by electrochemical anodization at constant current (75 mA cm(-2) for 30 min) in a sulfuric acid solution and characterized by the cyclic voltammetry technique to investigate the effect of pH on the process. It was found that at pH = 3, Cr(III) oxidation prevails over the competing water oxidation-oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hence increasing the efficiency of the process. A detailed study of pH (0-3), current density (12-24 mA cm(-2)), and cell type (divided-undivided) effects on bulk electrolysis of Cr(III) leachates in the batch prototype reactor resulted in process optimization. At pH = 3, 12 mA cm(-2) and a cathode inserted in a porous diaphragm envelope, nearly 70% conversion was achieved at a nearly 60% current efficiency, among the highest in the previously reported literature. The method (further optimized with an ion-selective membrane separator) could offer an attractive route for tannery Cr(III) conversion to Cr(VI) for reuse as an etchant or electroplating agent.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0944-1344	1614-7499		WOS:000779038100001	35381928

Elucidating the mechanisms of the two phosphotrans-esterification reactions that result in intron removal is important for our understanding of the molecular evolution of early genetic systems, as well as our knowledge of contemporary eukaryotic gene expression. The functional consequences of systematic alterations in the reactive groups can be invaluable for understanding catalytic mechanisms, especially for enzymes, such as the spliceosome, whose size and complexity place them beyond the reach of crystallographic and spectroscopic analysis. One type of modification that can be incorporated into a scissile phosphate linkage is the phosphorothiolate, in which a bridging phosphate oxygen is substituted with sulfur. Phosphorothiolate substitutions can be used to detect metal ion-ligand interactions by a "metal specificity switch" strategy. I review recent advances in the synthesis, incorporation, and manipulation of nucleoside phosphorothiolates (with an emphasis on 3'-S-phosphorothiolates), and describe their utility in the study of pre-mRNA splicing.

The as-prepared catalysts are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H-2-TPR), NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), surface area and pore structure. XPS and EPR were used to confirm the existence of Ti3+ and oxygen vacancy in the catalysts. The specific surface area, surface acidity, reducibility and valence state of the active components of the catalysts are significantly affected by the self-doping of Ti3+.

Native chickens distributed in a wide range of altitudes, have developed adaptive mechanisms to deal with hypoxia. For the first time, we report variants associated with high-altitude adaptation in Iranian native chickens by whole genome sequencing of lowland and highland chickens. We found that these adaptive variants are involved in DNA repair, organs development, immune response and histone binding. Amazingly, signature selection analysis demonstrated that differential variants are adaptive in response to hypoxia and are not due to other evolutionary pressures. Cellular component analysis of variants showed that mitochondrion is the most important organelle for hypoxia adaptation. A total of 50 variants was detected in mtDNA for highland and lowland chickens. High-altitude associated with variant discovery highlighted the importance of COX3, a gene involved in cell respiration, in hypoxia adaptation. The results of study suggest that MIR6644-2 is involved in hypoxia and high-altitude adaptations by regulation of embryo development. Finally, 3877 novel SNVs including the mtDNA ones, were submitted to EBI (PRJEB24944). Whole-genome sequencing and variant discovery of native chickens provided novel insights about adaptation mechanisms and highlights the importance of valuable genomic variants in chickens.									7	1	0	0	6	0	8			2045-2322			WOS:000472709300018	31239472

The structure of the obtained material was characterized by means of SEM, FTIR, XRD and XRS. The electrochemical behavior was investigated by the steady polarization and electrochemical polymerization of aniline. The results showed that ATO formed nano-particles in an even size of 10 nm and packed closely on the SiO2 thin layer. The conductivity increased with the content of ATO in the composite material, after three times of loading the volume resistance was measured to be 18 Omega . cm and the specific surface area was 77 m(2) . g(-1). The macroporous ATO/SiO2 anode showed an oxygen evolution potential in acidic and neutral conditons of 2.5 V and 2.2 V respectively. Aniline could be polymerized by the galvanostatic electropolymerization method and deposited on the ATO/SiO2 electrode. Cyclic voltammetry experiments showed electrical activity of the deposited polyaniline, the electrical signal increased as the electrode was immersed in H2SO4 for longer time, which indicated that a larger surface area provided a higher rate of electrochemical reaction on the macroporous electrode.									4	8	0	0	1	0	11			1001-4861			WOS:000281180800010

However, the energy density of aqueous EES devices is generally limited by their narrow thermodynamic potential window (similar to 1.23 V). In this paper, the synthesis of high purity layered Mn5O8 nanoparticles through solid state thermal treatment of Mn3O4 spinel nanoparticles, resulting in a chemical formula of [Mn-2(2+)] [Mn-3(4+) O-8(2-)], evidenced by Rietveld refinement of synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction, has been reported. The electro-kinetic analyses obtained from cyclic voltammetry measurements in half-cells have demonstrated that Mn5O8 electrode has a large overpotential (similar to 0.6 V) towards gas evolution reactions, resulting in a stable potential window of 2.5 V in an aqueous electrolyte in half-cell measurements. Symmetric full-cells fabricated using Mn5O8 electrodes can be operated within a stable 3.0 V potential window for 5000 galvanostatic cycles, exhibiting a stable electrode capacity of about 103 mAh/g at a C-rate of 95 with nearly 100% coulombic efficiency and 96% energy efficiency.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2095-1701	2095-1698		WOS:000410770500015

However, poor conductivity and limited exposure to active sites will affect the electrocatalytic activity of TMSes. Recently, many TMSes-based electrocatalysts are designed and reported to optimize its electronic structure and active sites. Herein, in this review, we focus on recent progress in TMSes-based electrocatalysts for water splitting. After overviewing the basic fundamentals of water splitting, this review discusses the prepared methods, electronic structure and typical materials of TMSes-based electrocatalysts. Finally, this review discusses future perspectives for the advancement of TMSes-based electrocatalysts. In short, this review will provide some new insights for the reasonable construction of TMSes-based electrocatalysts from the aspects of design and application in water splitting.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The electrochemical behaviors of the alumina/NCN composites were Studied systematically in some aggressive solutions (HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, NaOH, and KOH), using potentiodynamic polarization and chronoamperometry and X-ray diffraction and SEM observations. The results showed that the electrochemical stability and reproducibility of the composite electrodes in these diluted acids and alkalis were very good and had, in some extent, an electro-catalytic activity toward formation of hydrogen evolution and reduction of dissolved oxygen in aqueous solutions in comparison with a commercial graphite electrode. in addition, the pyrolyzed nano-carbon contents, size, and shape in the alumina matrix, have greatly effects on the electrochemical performances and electrode reactions in these solutions. It is found that the minimal residual carbon content of 0.62 wt.% in the matrix is enough to improve electrochemical performances and avoid to loss the ceramics physical Properties at the same time. When the additional potential in all the tested electrolytes was at + 1700 mV (vs. SCE), alumina particles at the electrode surface were not observed to dissolve into Solution in this case, indicating the material being Suitable for electrodes in aggressive solutions.

Structure and properties of PVMo11O40 heteropolyoxomolybdate supported on silica SBA-15 as selective oxidation catalyst								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				275	1			1	10		10.1016/j.jcat.2010.07.001				SEP 30 2010	2010	Investigations into structure and properties of heteropolyoxomolybdates (HPOM) supported on nanostructured silica SBA-15 for the selective oxidation of propene are presented. H-4[PVMo11O40] Keggin ions supported on SBA-15 (PVMo11-SBA-15) were prepared by incipient wetness of silica SBA-15 with suitable precursor solutions. Structure and properties of the resulting material were studied ex situ by X-ray diffraction and nitrogen physisorption measurements and in situ by combined X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and mass spectrometry under various reaction conditions. The characteristic structure of PVMo11-SBA-15 and its evolution under reactive gas atmosphere are compared to that of bulk H-4[PVMo11O40]center dot xH(2)O. Structural investigations of as-prepared PVMo11-SBA-15 have shown that the respective Keggin ions can be readily supported on silica SBA-15. In situ XAS measurements under reducing or oxidizing conditions revealed a pronounced support interaction effect. This effect resulted in a further decreased thermal stability of the supported Keggin ions compared to bulk H-4[PVMo11O40]center dot xH(2)O. Apparently, no stable HPOM Keggin ions could be obtained on silica SBA-15 under reaction conditions. However, in spite of their low thermal stability, HPOM supported on SBA-15 remain suitable well-defined precursors for preparing mixed oxide model catalysts for selective oxidation reactions.

MOLECULES				27	16					5203	10.3390/molecules27165203				AUG 2022	2022	This paper presents a comparative analysis of three carbon-based electrodes: bare multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), SnO2/MWCNT, and PbO2/graphene-nanoribbons (PbO2/GNR) composites, as anodes for the electrooxidative degradation of Rhodamine B as a model organic pollutant. Anodic electrooxidation of Rhodamine B was performed on all three electrodes, and the decolorization efficiency was found to increase in the order MWCNT < PbO2/GNR < SnO2/MWCNT. The electrodes were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). It was proposed that, in the 0.1 M Na2SO4 applied as electrolyte, observed decolorization mainly occurs in the interaction of Rhodamine B with OH radical adsorbed on the anode. Finally, the obtained results were complemented with Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations of OH-radical interaction with appropriate model surfaces: graphene(0001), SnO2(001), and PbO2(001). It was found that the stabilization of adsorbed OH-radical on metal oxide spots (SnO2 or PbO2) compared to carbon is responsible for the improved efficiency of composites in the degradation of Rhodamine B. The observed ability of metal oxides to improve the electrooxidative potential of carbon towards organic compounds can be useful in the future design of appropriate anodes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1420-3049		WOS:000846535500001	36014441

Here, we demonstrate a green method for fabrication of a number of transition metal phosphides (TMPs) by pyrolyzing melamine and self-assembled phytic acid (PA) cross-linked metal complexes. The obtained materials consisting of TMP nanoparticles (NPs) are encapsulated in N,P-codoped carbon (NPC). Among TMPs, the resultant FeP NPs encapsulated in the NPC matrix (FeP NPs@NPC) show the highest HER activity at all pH values. At a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), FeP NPs@NPC displays overpotentials of 130, 386 and 214 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1.0 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Additionally, the encapsulation by NPC effectively prevents FeP NPs from corrosion, exhibiting almost unfading catalytic activity after 10 h testing in acidic, neutral and basic electrolytes. More importantly, other TMPs wrapped in NPC (CoP NPs@NPC and Ni2P NPs@NPC) can be easily obtained by this method, which also exhibit relatively high activity toward HER. Therefore, this generic synthesis strategy opens a door for unprecedented design and fabrication of novel low-cost TMP based electrocatalysts for HER and other electrochemical applications.									161	7	0	0	4	0	162			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000397125500025	28244521

We observe the ethanol oxidation activity and stability to be size-dependent. The 10 nm Pd3Pb nanocrystals display the highest initial current densities, but after few hundred cycles, the current density of smaller nanocrystals becomes much larger. All of the catalysts exhibit a pronounced current decay during the first 500 s of continuous operation, which is associated with the accumulation of strongly adsorbed reaction intermediates, blocking reaction sites. These adsorbed species can be removed by cycling the catalysts or maintaining them at slightly higher potentials for a short period of time to oxidize and later reduce the Pd surface. Such simple cleaning processes, that can be performed during operation breaks without cell disassembly, is sufficient to effectively remove the poisoning species adsorbed on the surface and recover the electrocatalytic activity.									38	1	0	0	4	0	38			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000519337600030

To tackle this problem 2,5-Di-tert-1,4-benzoquinone (DBBQ) was introduced as a soluble redox mediator. This redox mediator is avoiding the Li2O2 layer-by-layer growth on the electrode surface and thus leading to higher discharge capacities of the Li-O-2 cell. In this study, we investigate the ion pairing between the cation of the conducting salt and the DBBQ monoanion and the resulting impact on the ORR activity of the DBBQ monoanion. We investigate TBA(+), K+ and Li+ as cations and TEGDME and DMSO as solvents. We found out that there is a direct correlation between the ORR activity of DBBQ(-) and the ion pairing of DBBQ(-) with the cation of the supporting electrolyte: Only if DBBQ is strongly associated with the cations of the electrolyte it will reduce oxygen in the electrolyte. Increasing the Li+ concentration in the electrolyte shifts the ORR potential to more positive electrode potentials. In addition, we are describing a new experimental approach to investigate the kinetics of the homogenous ORR via time resolved mass spectrometry. With this approach we found out, that the reaction Li center dot center dot center dot DBBQ((sol))+O-2(sol)<-> k-1k1Li center dot center dot center dot DBBQ center dot center dot center dot O-2(sol) is 80 times faster in a TEGDME based electrolyte than in a DMSO-based electrolyte. We determined k1 with 5.1 center dot 10(2) s(-1) M(-1)and k-1 with 3.7 10(2) s(-1) M-1 in TEGDME whereas the constants in DMSO are k1=4.5 s(-1) M-1 and k-1=5.5 s(-1) M(-1)s.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2196-0216			WOS:000505269700015

In this research, uniform hollow MoSe2/CdSe nanospheres (250 nm) were prepared by one-pot solvothermal strategy. It is the first time to synthesize hollow MoSe2 based nanostructure without any template/surfactant assistance. By varying reaction time, the formation mechanism was investigated, illuminating that the novel hollow structure is derived from the Kirkendall Effect. Both experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the Z-scheme mechanism of the charge transfer in the heterostructure. The hollow MoSe2/CdSe nanospheres (MC2) possess the remarkable photocatalytic activity in degradation of Cr(VI) (125 mg g(-1), simulated sunlight), owing to the high harvest of full spectrum, porous hollow structure and effective charge separation/transfer. Furthermore, the photocatalytic process was further studied in detail, showing that the Langmuir single-layer adsorption behavior, low pH value condition, and thermal effect also benefit to the high photoreduction performance. Benefiting from the Z-scheme mechanism, the high redox activity make sure the water splitting capacity of MC2 (7120.0 and 348.0 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) of H-2 and O-2 evolution) under simulated sunlight irradiation and its AQY for H-2 evolution at 670 nm reaches up to 27.2% (50 mg MC2).									88	6	0	0	11	0	90			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000457952600008

When PSII contains the 18- and 24-kDa extrinsic proteins, which restrict access to the active site, no C-14 labeling is obtained, NaCl, but not Na2SO4, competes with C-14 labeling in Mn-containing PSII preparations, and the concentration dependence of this competition parallels the activation of oxygen evolution, Formation of C-14-labeled adducts is observed in the presence or in the absence of a functional manganese cluster, However, no significant Cl- effect on C-14 labeling is observed in the absence of the Mn cluster, Isolation and quantitation of the C-14-labeled aldehyde product, produced from [C-14]benzylamine, gives yields of 1.8 +/- 0.3 mol/mol PSII and 2.9 +/- 0.2 mol/mol in Mn-containing and Mn-depleted PSII, respectively, The corresponding specific activities are 0.40 +/- 0.07 mu mol(mu mol PSII-hr)(-1) and 0.64 +/- 0.04 mu mol(mu mol PSII-hr)(-1). Cl- suppresses the production of [C-14]benzaldehyde in Mn-containing PSII, but does not suppress the production in Mn-depleted preparations, Control experiments show that these oxidation reactions do not involve the redox-active tyrosines, D and Z, Our results suggest the presence of one or more activated carbonyl groups in protein subunits that form the active site of PSII.									19	0	0	0	14	0	19			0027-8424			WOS:000072366600049	9482863

Here, a class of SACs based on atomically dispersed transition metals on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (MSA-N-CNTs, where M = Ni, Co, NiCo, CoFe, and NiPt) is synthesized with an extraordinarily high metal loading, e.g., 20 wt% in the case of NiSA-N-CNTs, using a new multistep pyrolysis process. Among these materials, NiSA-N-CNTs show an excellent selectivity and activity for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO, achieving a turnover frequency (TOF) of 11.7 s(-1) at -0.55 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), two orders of magnitude higher than Ni nano-particles supported on CNTs.									387	30	0	0	18	0	395			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000428793600021	29423964

Molecular Dynamics Simulations								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A				117	44			11115	11125		10.1021/jp4081096				NOV 7 2013	2013	A systematic comparison of atomistic modeling methods including density functional theory (DFT), the self-consistent charge density-functional tight-binding (SCC-DFTB), and ReaxFF is presented for simulating the initial stages of phenolic polymer pyrolysis. A phenolic polymer system is simulated for several hundred picoseconds within a temperature range of 2500 to 3500 K. The time evolution of major pyrolysis products including small-molecule species and char is examined. Two temperature zones are observed which demark cross-linking versus fragmentation. The dominant chemical products for all methods are similar, but the yields for each product differ. At 3500 K, DFTB overestimates CO production (300-400%) and underestimates free H (similar to 30%) and small CmHnO molecules (similar to 70%) compared with DFT. At 3500 K, ReaxFF underestimates free H (similar to 60%) and fused carbon rings (similar to 70%) relative to DFT. Heterocyclic oxygen-containing five- and six-membered carbon rings are observed at 2500 K. Formation mechanisms for H2O, CO, and char are discussed. Additional calculations using a semiclassical method for incorporating quantum nuclear energies of molecules were also performed. These results suggest that chemical equilibrium can be affected by quantum nuclear effects at temperatures of 2500 K and below. Pyrolysis reaction mechanisms and energetics are examined in detail in a companion manuscript.									73	4	0	0	2	0	75			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000326845300001	24094313

Therefore, we report a core-shell nanostructure Co3O4@NiCo LDH catalyst with Co3O4 nanowires as the core and NiCo LDH nanosheets as the shell, which has better electrocatalytic performance in alkaline solution compared with pure Co3O4 and NiCo LDH. The as-prepared Co3O4@NiCo LDH catalyst displays excellent activity for the OER with only overpotential of 279 mV to drive the current density of 15 mA cm(-2). In addition, it also exhibits prominent HER activity, only requiring a small overpotential of 113 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The synergistic effect from Co3O4 and NiCo LDH promotes the catalytic performance of electrocatalysts in overall water splitting systems, only requiring 1.66 V to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in a two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer. At the same time, the catalytic performance of the electrode has no obvious change after long time working, demonstrating its outstanding stability. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Electrons were heated during the plasma decay (i) by retarding electron thermalization through a strong dilution of the hydrocarbon with argon and (ii) by the application of an additional external electric field. Using the microwave interferometer, the temporal evolution of the electron density during plasma decay was studied in the range from 5 x 10(10) to 3 x 10(12) cm(-3). The analysis of the experimental data allowed us to obtain the dependence of the effective recombination coefficients of electrons with hydrocarbon ions on the electron temperature. A simplified kinetic scheme was proposed for the description of electron and ion reactions during the plasma decay for our experimental conditions. Calculations on the basis of this scheme showed that the plasma decay is controlled by the dissociative recombination of molecular and cluster hydrocarbon ions.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000505937800001

A growing body of evidence indicates that under physiological conditions, low concentrations of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) maintained by the activity of endogenous antioxidant system (AOS) allow reversible oxidative/nitrosative modifications of key redox-sensitive residues in regulatory proteins. The reversibility of redox modifications such as Cys S-sulphenylation/S-glutathionylation/S-nitrosylation/S-persulphidation and disulphide bond formation, or Tyr nitration, which occur through electrophilic attack of RONS to nucleophilic groups in amino acid residues provides redox switches in the activities of signalling proteins. Key requirement for the involvement of the redox modifications in RONS signalling including ROS-MAPK, ROS-PI3K/Akt, and RNS-TNF-alpha/NF-kappa B signalling is their specificity provided by a residue microenvironment and reaction kinetics. Glutathione, glutathione peroxidases, peroxiredoxins, thioredoxin, glutathione reductases, and glutaredoxins modulate RONS level and cell signalling, while some of the modulators (glutathione, glutathione peroxidases and peroxiredoxins) are themselves targets for redox modifications. Additionally, gene expression, activities of transcription factors, and epigenetic pathways are also under redox regulation. The present review focuses on RONS sources (NADPH-oxidases, mitochondrial electron-transportation chain (ETC), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), etc.), and their cross-talks, which influence reversible redox modifications of proteins as physiological phenomenon attained by living cells during the evolution to control cell signalling in the oxygen-enriched environment. We discussed recent advances in investigation of mechanisms of protein redox modifications and adaptive redox switches such as MAPK/PI3K/PTEN, Nrf2/Keapl, and NF-kappa B/I kappa B, powerful regulators of numerous physiological processes, also implicated in various diseases.									156	5	3	0	113	1	161			1071-5762	1029-2470		WOS:000432690000001	29589770	
J	Manna, P; LoBrutto, R; EijckelhofF, C; Dekker, JP; Vermaas, W								Role of Arg180 of the D2 protein in photosystem II structure and function								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY				251	1-2			142	154		10.1046/j.1432-1327.1998.2510142.x				JAN 15 1998	1998	On the basis of sequence comparison with the M subunit of the reaction center of purple bacteria, no residues in photosystem II can be clearly identified that may be predicted to correspond to the His residue that binds one of the accessory bacteriochlorophylls in the purple bacterial reaction center. However, the Arg 180 residue of the D2 protein is close to where this residue is predicted to be and could conceivably serve as a chlorophyll ligand. To analyze the function of Arg180, it was changed to nine different amino acids in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Except for the Ar180-->Gln (R180Q) mutant, the resulting strains were no longer photoautotrophic. The properties of photosystem II upon mutation of Arg280 were probed in strains from which photosystem I had been deleted genetically. Mutations at the Arg180 residue affected oxygen evolution capacity and the amount of photosystem II that was present in thylakoids. Surprisingly, in the Arg180 mutants, EPR signals that may originate from the oxidized redox-active Tyr160 of the D2 protein (Y-D(ox)) were small and generally did not resemble the usual signal IIs, signifying an effect of the Arg 180 mutations on the environment surrounding Tyr160. In addition, in most mutants, the charge recombination kinetics between the primary electron-accepting quinone in photosystem II (Q(A)(-)) and oxidized species on the donor side were faster upon introducing mutations at Arg180 suggesting an increased steady-state concentration of P680(+) in the mutants. However, Arg180 mutations also affected Q(A)(-) oxidation by the secondary electron-accepting quinone (Q(B)). HPLC analysis showed that, in the Arg180 mutants that were assayed, the pheophytin/chlorophyll ratio of photosystem II had not changed, indicating that the mutations did not lead to a pheophytinization of one of the chlorophyll molecules. Even though the results presented do not provide positive evidence that Arg180 of the D2 protein corresponds in function to the ligand to the central Mg in an accessory bacteriochlorophyll in reaction centers of purple bacteria, it is clear that changes in Arg180 greatly affect Tyr160 and P680. Various scenarios are discussed that are compatible with the data presented, and include an apparently close interaction between Arg180, His189, and Tyr160, and the possibility of the involvement of multiple chlorophylls to together form P680.									23	0	0	0	18	0	23			0014-2956			WOS:000071706800016	9492278

Their commercialization is hindered by the limited cycling stability-especially due to the zinc anode. In this study, we present a zinc anode that stands out with two advantages: The use of an energy-saving and low temperature preparation method, and the mechanical stabilization of the pore system with a lightweight anion-exchange ionomer.Our approach increases cycling stability for both the zinc-nickel oxide hydroxide cell and the zinc-oxygen cell: Electrochemical analysis in combination with operando X-ray diffraction measurements prove that the novel zinc anode is electrically rechargeable and can be cycled up to five times more often than zinc sponge anodes without anion-exchange ionomer to a depth of discharge of 35%. Scanning electron microscopy is used to evidence that the anion-exchange ionomer stabilises the entire pore system during cycling. We furthermore analyse zinc-oxygen batteries with anion-exchange ionomer at all parts-inside the zinc sponge anode, as separator and at the cathode. These cells can be electrically recharged with unprecedented high utilization of active material, and thus highlight the benefit of introducing an ion-selective coating into alkaline batteries with zinc anode.									44	0	0	0	1	0	47			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000438001800022

Effects of implementing PSI-light on hydrogen production via biophotolysis in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutant strains								BIOMASS & BIOENERGY				59				243	252		10.1016/j.biombioe.2013.09.004				DEC 2013	2013	A new strategy in hydrogen production via biophotolysis developed previously was implemented in mutant strains of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Implementing PSI-light successfully demonstrated improved hydrogen production in the wild type strain of C. reinhardtii in a previous study, however, the results also showed rapid attenuation of hydrogen production even under PSI-light due to inhibited hydrogenase activity caused by oxygen, which was simultaneously produced through the water splitting reactions of PSII under light. In order to further decrease oxygen generation under PSI-light during the hydrogen production phase, use of some mutant strains of C. reinhardtii, that are known to show limited oxygen generation, were investigated.Continuous supply of PSI-light after a short anaerobic adaptation under dark conditions achieved significantly prolonged hydrogen production up to approximate to 18 h in a chlorophyll b deficient mutant (cbn 1-48) and a very high light tolerant mutant (VHLR-S4) yielding chlorophyll content based H-2 production of 220 and 176 dm(3) kg(-1) (equivalent to dry cell weight based H-2 production of 4.24 and 8.73 dm(3) kg(-1)), respectively. In addition, by iterating light and dark every 1.5 h with PSI-light, hydrogen production was successfully extended to 27 h yielding chlorophyll content based H-2 production of 366 dm(3) kg(-1) (equivalent to dry cell weight based H-2 production of 8.81 dm(3) kg(-1)) in cbn 1-48. Further, greater energy conversion efficiency from light to the formation of hydrogen molecules was achieved with the combination of PSI-light and some mutant strains compared to alternate methods of biophotolysis.

The prepared Pd nanostructures had an average overall size of 70 nm and were composed of dozens of needle-like thin arms, originating from the same core, with an average thickness of 2.3 nm; the arms looked like chestnut-burs. Time evolution of Pd nanostructures implied that small Pd particles generated at the early stage of the reaction by fast reduction grew via the particle attachment growth mechanism. The morphology and size of the Pd nanostructures could be readily controlled by varying the concentration of CPC; depending on the amount of CPC, the reduction rates varied the morphology of the Pd nanostructures. Because of the huge surface area and possible catalytically active sites, the prepared chestnut-bur-like Pd nanostructures exhibited greater electrocatalytic activity toward ethanol electrooxidation compared to other Pd nanocatalysts, including cubic and octahedral Pd nanocrystals, and even commercial Pd/C.									35	0	0	0	1	0	35			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000333567300038	24608517

In this work, an environment-friendly and one-step strategy is developed to synthesize two-dimensional (2D/2D) NiS/graphene heterostructure composites via a pyrolysis accompanied sulfidation process using novel deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as precursors. The as-obtained 2D NiS/graphene heterostructures manifest excellent HER and OER activity in alkaline solution. Furthermore, the optimized 2D/2D heterostructure as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.54 Vat 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media, even superior than that of the integrated Pt/C and Iro(2) couples. The one-step DESs based procedure favors the interface coupling between graphene and NiS nanosheets, which significantly brings high surface-active sites exposure, enhances electrical conductivity, and results in high electrocatalytic activity. The DESs precursor has the advantage of solution reaction and acts as an environment-friendly synthetic strategy for clean energy generation.									60	1	0	0	4	0	60			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000472697500047

Competing reactions, including hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and surface oxidation, limit the conversion of CO2ER at low overpotentials. This is because these competing reactions produce intermediates (adsorbed H and OH) with chemical bonds similar to those formed in CO2ER (adsorbed COOH and OCHO). Here, we report the adsorption free energies of CO2ER and competitive intermediates within H-bonding functionalized metalloporphyrin frameworks using first-principles calculations. The functionalized frameworks shift the scaling relation of adsorption free energies to favor the CO2ER intermediates rather than the HER. Inspired by molecular catalysts, we proposed and studied H-bonding interfaces that specifically stabilize the target intermediates of the CO2ER. The selective H-bonding stabilization reduced the limiting potential for CO2ER by up to 0.2-0.3 V. Our results agree with previous experiments that found that cobalt- and iron-based metalloporphyrins exhibited the most promising catalytic activity in CO2-to-CO reduction, with small potential barriers for the adsorbed COOH intermediate. In addition, embedding the functionalized metalloporphyrin moieties in a rigid framework structure acted to enhance the CO2ER selectivity by preventing the porphyrin, from stacking and keeping H-bonding interfaces in close proximity to only CO2ER intermediates. Improved selectivity to the desired CO2ER was achieved through three steps: first by systematically screening for metal centers, second by creating an ideal H-bonding environment, and finally by using a rigid macrocycle ring structure.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000403973200049	28569508	
J	BURNS, RG; FISHER, DS								RATES OF OXIDATIVE WEATHERING ON THE SURFACE OF MARS								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS				98	E2			3365	3372		10.1029/92JE02055				FEB 25 1993	1993	The presence of sulfates and ferric-bearing assemblages in the Martian regolith implies that oxidative weathering of iron- and sulfur-bearing minerals has occurred through time on the surface of Mars. A model of acid weathering has been proposed for the iron-rich basalts on Mars. In this model, aqueous oxidation of iron sulfides released SO42- and H+ ions that initiated the dissolution of basaltic ferromagnesian silicates and released Fe2+ ions. The Fe2+ ions eventually underwent ferrolysis reactions and produced insoluble hydrous ferric oxide phases. Measurements of the time-dependence of acid weathering reactions have shown that pyrrhotite (Fe7S8) is rapidly converted to pyrite (FeS2) plus dissolved ferrous iron, the rate of pyrite formation decreasing with rising pH and lower temperatures. The rate of oxidation of aqueous Fe2+ ions derived from weathering of iron sulfides by dissolved atmospheric oxygen is known to be pH-dependent; rates are fast above pH 4.5 at ambient temperatures on the Earth's surface and much slower in acidic groundwater. On Mars, oxidation rates of dissolved Fe2+ ions in equatorial melt-waters in contact with the atmosphere (P(O2) = 10(-5) atm) are estimated to lie in the range 0.3-3.0 ppb Fe yr-1 over the pH range 2 to 6. These oxidation rates are more than 10(5) times slower than corresponding reactions near the freezing point of water on Earth. Oxidation of Fe2+ ions is estimated to be extremely slow in brine eutectic solutions that might be present on Mars and to be negligible in the frozen regolith. Such slow oxidation rates of aqueous Fe2+ ions in acidic groundwater (now permafrost) during the evolution of the Martian regolith would aid the stability, solubility and transport of iron in solution and other dissolved species over the surface of Mars.									67	2	0	0	6	0	67			2169-9097	2169-9100		WOS:A1993KX58700023

The gradual depletion of fossil fuels is another challenge regarding the future energy demand; therefore, alternative renewable energy research is necessary. One of the alternative approaches is the solar fuel generation by means of photocatalytic water splitting and more specifically, hydrogen evolution from water through the reductive half-reaction. Hydrogen is the cleanest fuel and does not produce any greenhouse gas upon direct combustion, or even while acting as a chemical feedstock for other transportable fuel generation. Therefore, it is desirable to produce efficient photocatalysts for solar water splitting. After the discovery of the first photocatalytic water splitting reaction by Fujisima and Honda, several advancements have been made with metal-based inorganic semiconductor photo-catalysts. However, their practical applicability is still under debate considering the environmental sustainability, stability and economical expenses. As a result, it is essential to develop alternate photocatalysts that are environmentally sustainable, cost-effective, stable and highly efficient. The metal-free approach is one of the most promising approaches in this regard. Herein, we discuss the recent developments in carbon-based materials and their hybrids as alternative metal free photocatalysts for solar water splitting. The present discussion includes g-C3N4, two-dimensional graphene/graphene oxides, one-dimensional carbon nanotubes/carbon nanofibers and zero-dimensional graphene QDs/carbon dots. We have focused on the rectification of exciton generation, charge separation and interfacial photochemical processes for photocatalysis, followed by possible optimization pathways of these typical all carbon-based materials. Finally, we have highlighted several fundamental challenges and their possible solutions, as well as the future direction on this particular aspect.									23	1	0	0	2	0	23			2516-0230			WOS:000588627700007	36132049

They are based on the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory and its extensions to include pairing correlations and quantum fluctuations. The TDHF theory is the lowest level of approximation of a range of methods to solve the quantum many-body problem, showing its universality to describe many-fermion dynamics at the mean-field level. The range of applications of TDHF to describe realistic systems allowing for detailed comparisons with experiment has considerably increased. For instance, TDHF is now commonly used to investigate fusion, multi-nucleon transfer and quasi-fission reactions. Thanks to the inclusion of pairing correlations, it has also recently led to breakthroughs in our description of the saddle to scission evolution, and, in particular, the non-adiabatic effects near scission. Beyond mean-field approaches such as the time-dependent random-phase approximation (TDRPA) and stochastic mean-field methods have reached the point where they can be used for realistic applications. We review recent progresses in both techniques and applications to heavy-ion collision and fission. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Here using density functional theory calculations, we systematically studied the potential of the heteronuclear 3d transition metal dimers anchored graphdiyne monolayers (FeM@ and NiM@GDY, M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) as efficient NRR catalysts. Among all the studied double-atom catalysts (DACs), FeCo@ and NiCo@GDY are the most promising with excellent NRR catalytic activity, high ability to suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and good stability. For both FeCo@ and NiCo@GDY, NRR prefers to the distal pathway with the calculated onset potentials of -0.44 and -0.36 V, respectively, which are comparable and even better than their homonuclear counterparts. Moreover, FeCo@ and NiCo@GDY have higher ability to suppress HER than Fe-2@ and Co-2@GDY, which may result from the modulated d state electronic structure due to the synergy effect of the heteronuclear atoms in the DACs. Our work not only suggests that FeCo@ and NiCo@GDY hold great promises as efficient, low-cost, and stable DACs for NRR, but also further provides a strategy, i.e. alloying the atomic metal catalysts, to improve the NRR catalytic activity and/or selectivity.

The combination of a large oxide-ion conductivity and a small free energy difference between the 4+/3+ oxidation states of many 3d transition metal ions enables these topotactic transformations. Herein, it is demonstrated that the electric field produced by a voltage-biased atomic force microscopy tip can induce such transformation between PV SrFeO3-delta and BM SrFeO2.5 at room temperature and with sub-micrometer spatial resolution. Interestingly, the structural transformation is kept after the electric field is removed, allowing a nonvolatile control of the local chemical, electrical, optical, and magnetic properties. Thus, the results presented in this paper open the door for the fabrication of stable ionic-based devices through the electric field patterning of different crystallographic phases.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000488165700001

Its nucleotide-binding site is made up of a unique Rossmann fold to accommodate the binding of the substrate NADH and of the primary electron acceptor flavin mononucleotide. Binding of NADH includes interactions of the hydroxyl groups of the adenosine ribose with a conserved glutamic acid residue. Structural analysis revealed that due to steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion, this residue most likely prevents the binding of NADPH, which is a poor substrate of the complex. We produced several variants with mutations at this position exhibiting up to 200-fold enhanced catalytic efficiency with NADPH. The reaction of the variants with NAD(P)H is coupled with proton translocation in an inhibitor-sensitive manner. Thus, we have created an energy-converting NADPH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase, an activity so far not found in nature. Remarkably, the oxidation of NAD(P) H by the variants leads to an enhanced production of reactive oxygen species.									12	0	0	0	8	0	12				1083-351X		WOS:000295406300017	21832062

The utilization of biomass/biochar in BF ironmaking is an effective countermeasure to reduce its CO_2 emission, as biomass/biochar is a renewable carbon source and environment neutron. Charging the biochar composite briquette(BCB)is a convenient method to introduce biomass/biochar into BF. The present research investigates the reaction behavior of the BCB in the BF. The BCB for the BF was prepared using cold briquetting followed by low-temperature heat treatment. The BCB was composed of 11.1% carbon, 72.7% magnetite, 11.25% wustite, 0.77% metallic iron, and 4.67% gangue(all in mass fraction). The BCB reaction model in the BF was developed considering the step-wise gaseous reduction of iron-oxide particles, CO_2 gasification of biochar particles, internal gas diffusion in the BCB, and mass transfer between the BCB and the environment. Isothermal BCB reaction tests were conducted for model validation. Using the model, the changes of the BCB iron-oxide reduction fraction and biochar conversion rate and the BCB microstructure evolution under simulated BF conditions were analyzed. The model was also applied to predict the change of the BCB iron-oxide reduction fraction, change of the BCB biochar conversion, change of the BCB CO generating rate, and change of the BCB CO_2 generation rate along a solid flowing path near the mid-radius in an actual BF. Results showed that under simulated BF conditions, the BCB underwent fast self-reduction and structure changes(forming low-melting compounds and transforming from the slag matrix to the iron network)from 60 min(973 K)to 120 min(1273 K). In an actual BF, the BCB reaction route is mainly divided into three stages:(1)reduction by BF gas(473-853 K),(2)reduction by the BF gas and partial self-reduction(853-953 K), and(3)full self-reduction(953-1150 K). In the stages involving BCB self-reduction, the iron oxide in the BCB reduces faster than the sinter, and the biochar gasifies faster than the coke. Moreover, in these stages, the BCB has the functions of increasing the BF gas utilization efficiency and lowering the temperature level of the BF thermal reserve zone.			研究了生物质复合团块在高炉中的反应行为,该复合团块主要成分(质量分数)为:11.1% C、72.7% Fe_3O_4、11.25% FeO、0.77% Fe和4.67%脉石.并对高炉环境下复合团块的反应行为进行了建模,通过高炉气氛下的等温动力学实验确定模型参数并进行了模型验证.进一步,结合模型模拟,模拟高炉环境的实验和团块微观结构分析,对模拟高炉条件下和实际高炉条件下团块的反应行为进行了分析.研究结果表明:模拟高炉条件下,在60 min(973 K)到120 min(1273 K)期间,团块的微观结构发生明显变化,其微观结构由渣相网络结构向金属铁网络结构转变.在实际高炉中,复合团块的反应进程主要包括三个阶段:团块的高炉煤气还原(473~853 K)、团块的高炉煤气还原和部分自还原(853~953 K)以及团块的完全自还原(953~1150 K).在团块自还原参与阶段,与烧结矿相比,团块内氧化铁还原速率更快;与焦炭相比,团块内生物质炭气化速率更高.同时,在此阶段,团块有提高高炉煤气利用率和降低高炉热储备区温度的作用.						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-9389			CSCD:7243296

Non-covalent exfoliation is attractive because the electronic structure of graphene is preserved but the yield is low and the lateral dimensions of the sheets are small. Chemical exfoliation via formation of graphite oxide is a highly versatile and scalable route but the covalent functionalization of graphene with oxygen significantly alters the properties. Here, we report a new method for large-scale facile synthesis of micron-sized partially oxidized graphene (POG) sheets with dramatically improved electronic properties compared to other solution-phase exfoliated graphene. Due to low initial oxygen content (similar to 12%), POG requires only mild annealing (<300 degrees C) to achieve a sheet resistance of 28 k Omega sq(-1) at the neutrality point, only a factor of similar to 4 larger than the intrinsic sheet resistance of pristine graphene (similar to 6 k Omega sq(-1)) and substantially lower than graphene exfoliated by other methods. Such a partial oxidation approach opens up new promising routes to solution based high-performance, low temperature, transparent and conducting graphene-based flexible electronics.									65	2	0	0	9	0	66			0959-9428	1364-5501		WOS:000292974400025

During the synthesis procedure, a 3D navicular ceria precursor (Ce(2)O(CO(3))(2)center dot H(2)O) with multi-layered structure was obtained after hydrothermal treatment at 100 degrees C for 10 h. Ceria with the same morphology can be obtained after thermal decomposition of this Ce(2)O(CO(3))(2)center dot H(2)O precursor. Structural properties of the products were characterized by XRD,TG-DTA, FT-IR, SEM, TEM, and N(2)-sorption techniques. Then a possible layer-by-layer electrostatic self-assembled growth mechanism was proposed for the formation of this 3D navicular architecture based on the experimental results and detail analysis of the evolution process of ceria precursors. Furthermore, a mold reaction of the catalytic oxidation of CO was conducted on the as-obtained CeO(2) and gold supported catalyst, both showed excellent activity and durability for CO conversion.

Measurements of the oxygen isotopic composition of water extracted under stepped pyrolysis from a bulk sample of this meteorite have allowed us to make comparisons with similar data obtained from CI and CM chondrites and so further investigate any relationships that may exist between these meteorites. The much lower yield of water bearing a terrestrial signature in Tagish Lake is indicative of the pristine nature of the meteorite. The relationship between the isotopic composition of this water and reported isotopic values for carbonates, bulk matrix and whole rock have been used to infer the extent and conditions under which parent-body aqueous alteration occurred. In Tagish Lake the difference in Delta(17)O isotopic composition between the water and other phases is greater than that found in either CM or CI chondrites suggesting that reaction and isotopic exchange between components was more limited. This in turn suggests that in the case of Tagish Lake conditions during the processes of aqueous alteration on the parent body, which ultimately controlled the formation of new minerals, were distinct from those on both CI and CM parent bodies.									51	0	0	0	2	0	51			1086-9379			WOS:000177152200006

However, the catalysts must also maintain their activity throughout the aggressive automotive drive-cycles in order to be implemented in fuel cells cars. Here, the durability of dealloyed PtCu catalysts was systematically evaluated under various voltage-cycles using a rotating ring disk electrode. The stability of the non-noble metal alloy component was proven at electrode potentials below 0.6V. The platinum stability was evaluated at potentials up to 1.1 V to avoid carbon corrosion and then up to 1.2 V to be closer to the more aggressive cycles developed in startup/shutdown events of the fuel cells. The major known failure modes such as non-noble metal dissolution, platinum dissolution, and particle growth/agglomeration were monitored in order to understand closely the PtCu nanoparticles behavior under different potential cycles and to provide a degradation fingerprint.

The most stable geometrical structure of the RP/ZnO heterojunction, i.e., an RP (001) plane and a ZnO (002) plane, exhibits charge redistribution largely at the interface region. Therefore, the effective interfacial charge transfer and the improved separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs can strongly boost reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generation reactions to enhance photocatalytic bacterial inactivation. The excellent light-activated point-of use disinfection can be achieved even through LED light of phone. Additionally, the RP/ZnO heterojunction also possesses excellent solar light-to-heat conversion efficiency, leading to further lethality to bacteria through hyperthermia. Antibacterial efficacy of 99.96 +/- 0.03% against Staphylococcus aureus at 5 min and 99.97 +/- 0.02% against Escherichia coli at 4 min can be attributed to the synergetic antibacterial activity of solar photocatalysis and photothermal effect (more than 50 degrees C in 2 min). This platform provides a surface strategy for designing synergetic photocatalytic and photothermal materials to fully harvest solar energy for not only water disinfection but also antibacterial surfaces in medical facilities, touch screen devices, or seawater desalination.									64	2	0	0	19	0	64			2366-9608			WOS:000461577400010

The presence of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in the Ag core has increased the photocatalytic activity over an extended wavelength range. The plasmon-induced resonant energy transfer (PIRET) and direct electron transfer (DET) have facilitated the excitation and separation of photogenerated e(-)/h(+) pairs, which has been further confirmed by electrochemical investigations. The presences of hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH), superoxide radicals (center dot O-2(-)) and singlet oxygen (O-2(-)) in the photocatalytic reaction system of Ag@ZnO/C photocatalyst have been demonstrated by electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements. All of the experiment results indicate that the ternary structure of Ag@ZnO/C can effectively enhance the photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the effects of introduced Ag contents and carbon source dosage were researched by comparative photocatalytic experiments, and the potential structures of photodegradation products were studied by HPLC-MS.									9	1	0	0	1	0	10			1793-2920	1793-7094		WOS:000436506000009

The development of non-precious-metal electrocatalysts is of paramount importance for their large-scale commercialization. Here, Co-Fe binary alloy embedded bimetallic organic frameworks (BMOF)s based on carbon nanocomposites have been designed with a compositionally optimized template, by a facile host-guest strategy, for ORR in alkaline media. The electrocatalyst exhibits promising electrocatalytic activity for ORR with a half-wave potential of 0.89 V in 0.1 M NaOH, comparable to state-of-the-art Pt/C electrocatalysts. More importantly, it exhibits robust durability after 30 000 potential cycles. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and quantitative energy-dispersive Xray (EDX) spectroscopy suggest that the Co-Fe alloy nanoparticles have a homogeneous elemental distribution of Co and Fe at the atomic-scale optimized BMOF and Co/Fe ratio of 9:1. The long-term durability is attributed to its ability to maintain its structural and compositional integrity after the cycling process, as evidenced by STEM-EDX analysis. This work provides valuable insights into the design and fabrication of novel platinum-group-metals-free highly active ORR electrocatalysts in alkaline media.									122	6	0	0	7	0	124			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000475533500023	31246446

SURFACE SCIENCE				640				165	180		10.1016/j.susc.2015.01.006				OCT 2015	2015	In this perspective we discuss how an intimate interaction of experiments with theory is able to deepen our insight into the catalytic reaction system on the molecular level. This strategy is illustrated by discussing various examples from our own research of surface chemistry and model catalysis. The particular examples were carefully chosen to balance the specific strength of both approaches - theory and experiment - and emphasize the benefit of this combined approach. We start with the determination of complex surface structures, where diffraction techniques in combination with theory are clear-cut. The promoter action of alkali metals in heterogeneous catalysis is rationalized with theory and experiment for the case of CO coadsorption. Predictive power of theory is limited as demonstrated with the apparent activity of chlorinated TiO2(110) in the oxidation of HCl: Even if we know all elementary reaction steps of a catalytic reaction mechanism, the overall kinetics may remain elusive and require the application kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. Catalysts are not always stable under reaction conditions and may chemically transform as discussed for the CO oxidation reaction over ruthenium. Under oxidizing reaction conditions ruthenium transforms into RuO2, a process which is hardly understood on the molecular level. Lastly we focus on electrochemical reactions. Here theory is clearly ahead since spectroscopic methods are not available to resolve the processes at the electrode surface. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Platinum nanoparticles were deposited on this support via the incipient wetness method. X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and nitrogen desorption were used to investigate their microstructure. Of the formulations studied, Ta0.3Ti0.7O2 possessed an adequate powder electronic conductivity of 0.2 S/cm. The capacitance of this Ta0.3Ti0.7O2 support changed by only 12% whereas the pseudocapacitance of a carbon benchmark changed by over 100% over 10,000 support stability test cycles (support stability test protocol: 1.0-1.5 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 500 mV/s in a 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte at 25 degrees C) under identical test conditions. The stability of 20% Pt/Ta0.3Ti0.7O2, 20% Pt/C, and 46% Pt/C (commercial, TKK) catalysts were evaluated by monitoring the evolution of the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) under load cycling (load cycling protocol: 0.6-0.95 V vs. RHE with a dwell time of 3 s at either potentials in a 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte at 25 degrees C). The loss in ECSA in 20% Pt/Ta0.3Ti0.7O2 was found to be 35% compared to 44-47% for 20% Pt/C and 46% Pt/C over 10,000 load cycles. 20% Pt/Ta0.3Ti0.7O2 yielded the following performance-related metrics: the ECSA of this electrocatalyst was 41 m(2)/g, the mass activity and area-specific activities for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). determined at 0.9 V vs. RHE in a 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte at 25 degrees C were 62 mA/mg(Pt) and 151 mu A/cm(Pt)(2), respectively. Koutecky-Levich analysis carried out to evaluate ORR kinetics suggested that all 3 catalysts (20% Pt/Ta0.3Ti0.7O2, 20% Pt/C and 46% Pt/C) demonstrated similar ORE mechanisms. We propose that Ta0.3Ti0.7O2 shows outstanding promise as a corrosion-resistant alternative to carbon as an electrocatalyst support in polymer electrolyte fuel cells.

JOURNAL OF PINEAL RESEARCH				42	1			28	42		10.1111/j.1600-079X.2006.00407.x				JAN 2007	2007	Melatonin is a highly conserved molecule. Its presence can be traced back to ancient photosynthetic prokaryotes. A primitive and primary function of melatonin is that it acts as a receptor-independent free radical scavenger and a broad-spectrum antioxidant. The receptor-dependent functions of melatonin were subsequently acquired during evolution. In the current review, we focus on melatonin metabolism which includes the synthetic rate-limiting enzymes, synthetic sites, potential regulatory mechanisms, bioavailability in humans, mechanisms of breakdown and functions of its metabolites. Recent evidence indicates that the original melatonin metabolite may be N-1-acetyl-N-2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK) rather than its commonly measured urinary excretory product 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate. Numerous pathways for AFMK formation have been identified both in vitro and in vivo. These include enzymatic and pseudo-enzymatic pathways, interactions with reactive oxygen species (ROS)/reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and with ultraviolet irradiation. AFMK is present in mammals including humans, and is the only detectable melatonin metabolite in unicellular organisms and metazoans. 6-Hydroxymelatonin sulfate has not been observed in these low evolutionary-ranked organisms. This implies that AFMK evolved earlier in evolution than 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate as a melatonin metabolite. Via the AFMK pathway, a single melatonin molecule is reported to scavenge up to 10 ROS/RNS. That the free radical scavenging capacity of melatonin extends to its secondary, tertiary and quaternary metabolites is now documented. It appears that melatonin's interaction with ROS/RNS is a prolonged process that involves many of its derivatives. The process by which melatonin and its metabolites successively scavenge ROS/RNS is referred as the free radical scavenging cascade. This cascade reaction is a novel property of melatonin and explains how it differs from other conventional antioxidants. This cascade reaction makes melatonin highly effective, even at low concentrations, in protecting organisms from oxidative stress. In accordance with its protective function, substantial amounts of melatonin are found in tissues and organs which are frequently exposed to the hostile environmental insults such as the gut and skin or organs which have high oxygen consumption such as the brain. In addition, melatonin production may be upregulated by low intensity stressors such as dietary restriction in rats and exercise in humans. Intensive oxidative stress results in a rapid drop of circulating melatonin levels. This melatonin decline is not related to its reduced synthesis but to its rapid consumption, i.e. circulating melatonin is rapidly metabolized by interaction with ROS/RNS induced by stress. Rapid melatonin consumption during elevated stress may serve as a protective mechanism of organisms in which melatonin is used as a first-line defensive molecule against oxidative damage. The oxidative status of organisms modifies melatonin metabolism. It has been reported that the higher the oxidative state, the more AFMK is produced. The ratio of AFMK and another melatonin metabolite, cyclic 3-hydroxymelatonin, may serve as an indicator of the level of oxidative stress in organisms.									1214	24	19	0	922	17	1268			0742-3098	1600-079X		WOS:000242835500004	17198536

Heritable variation in reaction norms of metabolism and activity across temperatures in a wild-derived population of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus)								JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY				184	4			525	534		10.1007/s00360-014-0811-6				MAY 2014	2014	Heritable variation in metabolic traits is likely to affect fitness. In this study, white-footed mice from wild-derived photoresponsive [R, infertile in short day length (SD)] and non-photoresponsive (NR, fertile in SD) selection lines were maintained under short-day (SD 8Light:16Dark), sub-thermoneutral conditions (22 or 12 A degrees C). Mice had significantly higher levels of food intake and resting metabolic rates (RMR) at low temperature. RMR differed significantly between lines (greater in NR mice). In contrast to previous work under thermoneutral conditions, there was no significant difference in overall activity or average daily metabolic rates (ADMR) of mice from the two lines. Reduced activity may reflect behavioral changes under cooler conditions (e.g., nest building) reducing the overall energetic cost of fertility (for NR mice). There was no significant difference in maximal rate of oxygen consumption () between lines. R mice had significantly greater brown adipose tissue and white abdominal fat mass due to both line and temperature. Reaction norms for intake, resting metabolism (RMR/BMR) and level of activity from current (12 and 22 A degrees C) and previously published data (28 A degrees C) demonstrate independent effects of genetics (line) and environment (temperature) for resting metabolism, but a clear interaction between these for activity. The results suggest that fertility under winter conditions imposes metabolic costs that are related to the level of reproductive development. Under the coldest conditions tested, however, mice that remained fertile in SD reduced activity, ADMR and food requirements, decreasing the differential between selection lines. Heritable variation in reaction norms suggests a genetic by environment effect that could be subject to selection.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0174-1578	1432-136X		WOS:000334498900009	24549715

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis identified the existence of Sv in Cu2S@MoS2-x. Sulfadiazine (SDZ), a typical antibiotic, was selected as the target contaminant to evaluate the catalytic activity of Cu2S@MoS2-x via H2O2 activation. With adding 0.2 g/L Cu2S@MoS2-2 and 5 mM H2O2, 95.9% of SDZ (20 mu M) was removed in 60 min and the reaction rate constant obtained by Cu2S@-MoS2-2 (0.239 min(-1)) was improved by 4 times and 10 times in contrast with Cu2S (0.0622 min-1) and MoS2 (0.0219 min(-1)). EPR analysis and radical scavenger tests confirmed center dot OH and O-1(2) as the dominated reactive oxygen species (ROS). In Cu2S@MoS2-2 activated H2O2 system, the yield of O-1(2) was 6.12 x 10(-14) mol/L, more than 8 times that in Cu2S/H2O2 system (0.73 x 10(-14) mol/L). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation revealed that the Cu atoms exposed by the formation of Sv on Cu2S@MoS2-2 were the preferred adsorption sites for O-2, which further achieved the conversion of O-2 to center dot O-2(-) . In the activation process, Cu2S mainly produced center dot OH through sulfur-enhanced Fenton process, while MoS2 shell accounted for the O-2 production. Thereafter, the obtained O-2 acquired electrons from the Cu atoms exposed by Sv to produce center dot O-2(-) , followed by the generation of O-1(2). The cooperation between MoS2 and Cu2S resulted in the superior catalytic activity. The excellent recyclability, stability, and adaptability demonstrated Cu2S@MoS2-2 as a reliable candidate for activating H2O2 toward refractory organics degradation.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000810336700002

Size-and composition-selected clusters can also serve as models of the catalytic active site, where an addition or removal of a single atom can have a dramatic effect on their activity and selectivity. In this perspective, we provide an overview of studies performed under both ultra-high vacuum and realistic reaction conditions aimed at the interrogation, characterization, and understanding of the performance of supported size-selected clusters in heterogeneous and electrochemical reactions, which address the effects of cluster size, cluster composition, cluster-support interactions, and reaction conditions, the key parameters for the understanding and control of catalyst functionality. Computational modeling based on density functional theory sampling of local minima and energy barriers or ab initio molecular dynamics simulations is an integral part of this research by providing fundamental understanding of the catalytic processes at the atomic level, as well as by predicting new materials compositions which can be validated in experiments. Finally, we discuss approaches which aim at the scale up of the production of well-defined clusters for use in real world applications.

Inspired by the biological manganese-based active site for this reaction in the enzyme Photosystem II, researchers have made impressive progress in the last decades regarding the development of synthetic manganese catalysts for water oxidation. For this, it has been especially fruitful to explore the many different types of known manganese oxides MnOx.This chapter first offers an overview of the structural, thermodynamic, and mechanistic aspects of water-oxidation catalysis by MnOx. The different test systems used for catalytic studies are then presented together with general reactivity trends. As a result, it has been possible to identify layered, mixed Mn-III/IV -oxides as an especially promising class of bio-inspired catalysts and an attempt is made to give structure-based reasons for the good performances of these materials.In the outlook, the challenges of catalyst screenings (and hence the identification of a "best MnOx catalyst") are discussed. There is a great variety of reaction conditions which might be relevant for the application of manganese oxide catalysts in technological solar fuel-producing devices, and thus catalyst improvements are currently still addressing a very large parameter space. Nonetheless, detailed knowledge about the biological catalyst and a solid experimental basis concerning the syntheses and water-oxidation reactivities of MnOx materials have been established in the last decade and thus this research field is well positioned to make important contributions to solar fuel research in the future.									35	1	1	0	5	0	36			0340-1022		978-3-319-23099-3; 978-3-319-23098-6	WOS:000363875500004	25980320

However, it largely remains unclear how sHSP26 functions in maize under heat stress. Here, 2-DE-based proteomics, RNA interference (RNAi), co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) were used to reveal chloroplast proteins interacting with sHSP26 and how sHSP26 functions under heat stress. After the silencing of sHSP26, a total of 45 protein spots from isolated protoplasts were greatly changed in abundance, of which 33 spots are chloroplastic. Co-IP revealed that nine proteins possibly associated with 5HSP26. Y2H demonstrated that six chloroplast proteins interact with 5HSP26 under heat stress. In particular, four proteins, including ATP synthase subunit beta, chlorophyll a b binding protein, oxygen-evolving enhancer protein 1 and photosystem I reaction center subunit IV, strongly interacted with sHSP26 and their abundance greatly declined after RNAi of 5HSP26 under heat stress. In addition, H2O2 accumulation in the chloroplasts significantly increased the expression of sHSP26, and the suppression of sHSP26 expression significantly reduced the O-2 evolution rate of photosystem II under heat stress. Overall, these findings demonstrate the relevance of sHSP26 in protecting maize chloroplasts under heat stress.Biological significanceMaize is one of the most important crops worldwide. Frequent heat stress reduces significantly the yield and quality of maize. Our results demonstrated that 5HSP26 improved maize chloroplast performance under heat stress by interacting with specific proteins. These findings are useful for understanding the mechanism of heat stress response and heat-tolerant molecular breeding in maize. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

NADPH oxidase is the main source of intracellular ROS. In the present study, five subunits of the phagocytic NADPH oxidase complex were identified in orange-spotted grouper , (Epinephelus coioides). The open reading frame of grouper gp91(phox), p22(phox), p67(phox), p47(phox) and p40(P)(hox) were 1,698 bp, 564 bp, 1,497 bp, 1,290 bp, and 1,050 bp, respectively, and encoded 565, 187, 498, 429, and 349 amino acids. Evolutionary analysis indicated that these proteins are evolutionarily homologous to the corresponding proteins of other fish and mammals, and contain conserved functional domains and sites that are important in mammals. In addition, real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the expression of these five genes was higher in immune-related tissues in normal grouper, and that these genes were up-regulated in gill and spleen after C. irritans infection, which suggests that these genes may be involved in the defense against C. irritans infection.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000523601500030	32058095

Here, a novel high-performance Na-bridged photocatalyst with nitrogen vacancies (WNCN) was successfully synthesized via one-step thermal-polymerization technique. The optimized carbon nitride can create an intrinsic driving force to achieve the directional separation of disordered carriers. Simultaneously, the bridged Na can serve as adsorptive site of fluoroquinolone antibiotics. Density function theory confirmed that the nitrogen vacancies served as re -action sites, which favored the activation of oxygen to regulate the formation of .OH. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of dual-functional sites, the optimized structure exhibited superior photocatalytic activity (0.5932 min(-1)), achieving over 11 times the kinetic degradation efficacy for enrofloxacin in contrast to pristine CN (0.0514 min(-1)). The concept of the directional utilization of disordered charges may be extended to other photocatalysts, thereby guiding the development of more practical photocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000799836600001

However, HEO is easy to harden during sintering, which results in a few defective sites for anchoring single-atom metals. Herein, we present a sol-gel-assisted mechanical milling strategy to achieve a single-atom catalyst of Pt-HEO/Al2O3. The strong interaction between HEO and Al2O3 effectively inhibits the growth of HEO microparticles, which leads to generation of more surface defects because of the nanoscale effect. Meanwhile, another strong interaction between Pt and HEO stabilizes single-atom Pt on HEO. Temperature-programmed techniques further verify that the reactivity of surface lattice oxygen species is enhanced because of the Pt-O-M bonds on the surface of HEO. Unlike conventional single-atom Pt catalysts, Pt-HEO/Al2O3 as a heterogeneous catalyst not only exhibits superior stability against hydrothermal aging but also presents long-term reaction stability for CO catalytic oxidation, which exceeds 540 h. The present work opens a new door for rational design of hydrothermally stable single-atom Pt catalysts, which are highly promising in practical applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000710924900041	34633806

Recently, much effort has been dedicated to developing low-cost, highly efficient, and stable electrocatalysts. Transition metal phosphides are investigated intensively due to their high electronic conductivity and optimized absorption energy of intermediates in acid electrolytes. However, the low stability of metal phosphide materials in air and during electrocatalytic processes causes a decay of performance and hinders the discovery of specific active sites. The HER in alkaline media is more intricate, which requires further delicate design due to the Volmer steps. In this work, phosphorus-modified monoclinic beta-CoMoO4 is developed as a low-cost, efficient, and stable HER electrocatalyst for the electrolysis of water in alkaline media. The optimized catalyst shows a small overpotential of 94 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER with high stability in KOH electrolyte, and an overpotential of 197 mV to reach a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). Combined computational and in situ spectroscopic techniques show P is present as a surface phosphate ion; that electron holes localize on the surface ions and both (P-O1-) and Co3+-OH- are prospective surface active sites for the HER.									56	1	0	0	3	0	56				2198-3844		WOS:000527565900001	32596112

The collective effects of special morphological design and electronic structure engineering enable the integrated electrocatalyst to have very high activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and excellent stability in a wide pH range. Ni0.89Co0.11Se2 MNSN/NF is revealed to exhibit an overpotential ((10)) of 85 mV at -10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline medium (pH 14) and (10) of 52 mV in acidic solution (pH 0), which are the best among all selenide-based electrocatalysts reported thus far. In particular, it is shown for the first time that the catalyst can work efficiently in neutral solution (pH 7) with a record (10) of 82 mV for all noble metal-free electrocatalysts ever reported. Based on theoretical calculations, it is further verified that the advanced all-pH HER activity of Ni0.89Co0.11Se2 is originated from the enhanced adsorption of both H+ and H2O induced by the substitutional doping of cobalt at an optimal level. It is believed that the present work provides a valuable route for the design and synthesis of inexpensive and efficient all-pH HER electrocatalysts.									343	19	0	0	13	0	348			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000401170600024	28262994

We tested the hypothesis that, after cerebral ischemia, nitric oxide (NO) produced by iNOS enhances COX-2 activity, thereby increasing the toxic potential of this enzyme. Cerebral ischemia was produced by middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats or mice. Twenty-four hours after ischemia in rats, iNOS-immunoreactive neutrophils were observed in close proximity (<20 mu m) to COX-2-positive cells at the periphery of the infarct, In the olfactory bulb, only COX-2 positive cells were observed. Cerebral ischemia increased the concentration of the COX-2 reaction product prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) in the ischemic area and in the ipsilateral olfactory bulb, The iNOS inhibitor aminoguanidine reduced PGE(2) concentration in the infarct, where both iNOS and COX-2 were expressed, but not in the olfactory bulb, where only COX-2 was expressed. Postischemic PGE(2) accumulation was reduced significantly in iNOS null mice compared with wild-type controls (C57BL/6 or SV129), The data provide evidence that NO produced by iNOS influences COX-2 activity after focal cerebral ischemia, Proinflammatory prostanoids and reactive oxygen species produced by COX-2 may be a previously unrecognized factor by which NO contributes to ischemic brain injury. The pathogenic effect of the interaction between NO, or a derived specie, and COX-2 is likely to play a role also in other brain diseases associated with inflammation.									255	14	1	0	223	0	276			0027-8424			WOS:000075730500111	9724813

In higher plants, glutamate 1-semialdehyde aminotransferase (GSA-AT) catalyzes the last step in the sequential conversion of glutamate to 5-aminolevulinate. Antisense RNA synthesis for GSA-AT leads to reduced GSA-AT protein levels in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) plants. We have used these transgenic plants for studying the significance of chlorophyll (Chl) availability for assembly of the light-harvesting apparatus. To avoid interfering photoinhibitory stress, plants were cultivated under a low photon flux density of 70 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1). Decreased GSA-AT expression does not seem to suppress other enzymic steps in the Chl pathway, indicating that reduced Chl content in transgenic plants (down to 12% of the wild-type level) is a consequence of reduced GSA-AT activity. Chl deficiency correlated with a drastic reduction in the number of photosystem I and photosystem II reaction centers and their surrounding antenna on a leaf area basis. Different lines of evidence from the transgenic plants indicate that complete assembly of light-harvesting pigment-protein complexes is given preference over synthesis of new reaction center/core complexes, resulting in fully assembled photosynthetic units with no reduction in antenna size. Photosynthetic oxygen evolution rates and in vivo Chl fluorescence showed that GSA-AT antisense plants are photochemically competent. Thus, we suggest that under the growth conditions chosen during this study, plants tend to maintain their light-harvesting antenna size even under limited Chl supply.									27	0	0	0	21	0	28			0032-0889			WOS:A1997WU18800012	12223663

The catalytic cycle consists of four major steps: ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate binding, enolization, CO2 or O-2 addition and hydration, and cleavage of the intermediate. The use of individual rate constants for these elemental steps yields mathematical expressions for usual kinetic constants (k(cat), K-m), CO2 versus O-2 specificity (S-c/o) as well as other chemical parameters such as the C-12/C-13 isotope effect. That said, most of them are not simple and thus the interpretation of experimental and observed values of k(cat), K-m and S-c/o may be more complicated than expected. That is, Rubisco effective catalysis depends on several kinetic parameters that are influenced by both the biological origin and the cellular medium (which, in turn, can vary with environmental conditions). In this brief review, we present the basic model of Rubisco kinetics and describe how subtle biochemical changes (which may have occurred along Evolution) can easily modify Rubisco catalysis.									50	0	0	0	39	0	50			0140-7791	1365-3040		WOS:000322709300003	23305122

Discovering new nanomaterials for electrocatalysis and maintaining their long-term stability is an effective way. The presence of nanoparticles in an independent transparent substrate material provides a unique way for its stability and maximum performance. This special composite structure is very beneficial to the study of the fine structure of a single specific particle. Here, we propose a general synthesis strategy, in which alloy targets are implanted into the substrate by ion implantation and annealed to grow into NPs. The disordered arrangement of ions into the substrate and the subsequent slow dynamics, dis -ordered microscopic microstructure. Calculating the similarity of the depth range of simulated metal ion implantation provides a theoretical basis for the successful formation of HEMG-NPs. Electrocatalytic water splitting shows that CuCoNiFeZn HEMG-NPs is a non-precious single nano-microcatalyst suitable for multifunctional (HER and OER) electrocatalysis, highlighting its application in sustainable energy conver-sion. The use of ion implantation aims to synthesize HEMG-NPs with long-term stable storage and mini-mized denaturation. In further research, the formation of fine structure corresponds to the law of electrocatalytic activity.

Backswimmers of the genera Anisops and Buenoa (Natonectidae) have high concentrations of hemoglobin in the large tracheal cells of the abdomen. Oxygen from the hemoglobin is delivered to a gas bubble and controls the buoyant density, which enables the bugs to maintain their position without swimming and to remain stationary in the mid-water zone where they hunt for prey. We have obtained the cDNA sequences of three Anisops deanei hemoglobin chains by RT-PCR and RACE techniques. The deduced amino acid sequences show an unusual insertion of a single amino acid in the conserved helix E, but this does not affect protein stability or ligand binding kinetics. Recombinant A. deanei hemoglobin has an oxygen affinity of P-50 = 2.4 kPa (18 torr) and reveals the presence of a dimeric fraction or two different conformations. The absorption spectra demonstrate that the Anisops hemoglobin is a typical pentacoordinate globin. Phylogenetic analyses show that the backswimmer hemoglobins evolved within Heteroptera and most likely originated from an intracellular hemoglobin with divergent function. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

An L3 protolith for NWA 8709 is inferred on the basis of oxygen isotope composition, elemental composition, diverse mineral chemistry, and overall texture. NWA 8709 is among the most strongly shocked type 3 chondrites known, and experienced complete melting of the matrix and partial melting of chondrules. Unmelted phases underwent FeO reduction and partial homogenization, with reduction possibly occurring by reaction of olivine and low-Ca pyroxene with an S-bearing gas that was produced by vaporization. Chondrules and metal grains became foliated by uniaxial compaction, and during compression, chondrules and fragments became attached to form larger clumps. This process, and possibly also melt incorporation into chondrules to cause "inflation," may have contributed to anomalously large chondrule sizes in NWA 8709. The melt breccia character is attributed to strong shock affecting a porous precursor. Data-model comparisons suggest that a precursor with 23% porosity that was impacted by a 3 km/s projectile could have produced the meteorite. The rarity of other type 3 ordinary chondrite melt breccias implies that the immediate precursors to such chondrites were lower in porosity than the NWA 8709 precursor, or experienced weaker shocks. Altogether, the data imply a predominantly "quiet" dynamical environment to form most type 3 ordinary chondrites, with compaction occurring in a series of relatively weak shock events.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1086-9379	1945-5100		WOS:000568285200001		
J	Fu, Shurong; Zhang, Beibei; Hu, Hongyan; Zhang, Yajun; Bi, Yingpu								ZnO nanowire arrays decorated with PtO nanowires for efficient solar water splitting								CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				8	11			2789	2793		10.1039/c8cy00656c				JUN 7 2018	2018	Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising method for storing solar energy in the form of hydrogen fuel. However, the high recombination ratios of electron-hole pairs and the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) severely restrict the PEC efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate that vertically-oriented PtO nanowires could be highly selectively grown on ZnO nanowire arrays to construct a novel cross-linked heterostructure by a light-controlled growth method. The key to PtO nanowire growth and interactions is based on the use of a photogenerated electric field from ZnO nanowire arrays. More importantly, these PtO nanowires are utilized, for the first time, as highly efficient OER cocatalysts in PEC water splitting systems to produce hydrogen and exhibit much higher activities than other Pt species decorated samples. Systematic studies reveal that the excellent PEC performance should be attributed to the pure PtO crystalline phase and vertically-oriented nanowire structure, which could effectively facilitate the hole trapping/transport and provide more active sites for water oxidation. These results provide a new insight and strategy to construct special structured OER cocatalysts on PEC photoanodes for enhancing water splitting performance.									14	3	0	0	0	0	16			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000434386000004

Here, we develop a novel two-dimensional g-C3N4/WO3/MoS2 (CWM) ternary nanocomposite through a facile co-calcination and a hydrothermal process to reach a highly-efficient photocatalyst for organic pollutant elimination under visible light. The WO3 and MoS2 nanoparticles were dispersed on the ultra-thin g-C3N4 nanosheets, in which the electronegative g-C3N4 facilitates formation of oxygen vacancies in WO3. Compared to pure g-C3N4, WO3, and binary composites, CWM exhibited higher photocatalytic activities for various organic pollutants removal under visible light irradiation. For instance, the CWM showed a removal ratio of similar to 99% for RhB after only 10 min irradiation of visible light (lambda > 420 nm) and nearly 100% for ciprofloxacin after 2 h of operation. The results showed that (OH)-O-center dot radicals are the main active species for organic degradation, which suggests a direct Z-scheme heterojunction in CWM that improved spatial separation of charge carries. Furthermore, the collection of electrons is significantly enhanced by MoS2 for oxygen reduction reaction, and the increased oxygen vacancies of WO3 further enhanced the separation of electron-hole pairs; therefore, it led to an effective suppression of charge carriers recombination. The above synergistic effects of ternary photocatalyst result in higher photocatalytic oxidation performance for wastewater treatment compared with pure WO3, g-C3N4 and their binary composites.

Cabernet Sauvignon wine is well known for its high concentration of tannin, making it an ideal red wine for aging. The impact of closure type after 5 years' bottle aging has been investigated on a 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon red wine, treated with or without polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) and micro-oxygenation (Mox). Two oxygen transfer rate (OTR) conditions (16 and 5 mu g per day) into 375 mL bottles were obtained by using different synthetic stoppers.RESULTSColor was evaluated by UV-visible spectrophotometry, carbonyls by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine derivatization, phenolics by high-performance liquid chromatography and sulfur dioxide by the aspiration method. Closure type strongly influenced color parameters involving SO2 bleaching and some phenolics, particularly quercetin, were affected, but there was little effect on carbonyls other than acetaldehyde. PVPP treatment afforded wines with the lowest levels of phenolics and color density, but highest acetaldehyde. Few effects of Mox could be detected.CONCLUSIONSClosure OTR strongly affects sulfur dioxide levels - the primary antioxidant in wine - in aged wine, but phenolic levels substantially alter the secondary reactions of oxidative aging.

J	Guo, Bin; Yang, Liqing; Hu, Weijie; Li, Wenlong; Wang, Haojing								Effect of nano-sized cerium zirconium oxide solid solution on far-infrared emission properties of tourmaline powders								MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS B				29	30					1550183	10.1142/S0217984915501833				NOV 10 2015	2015	Far-infrared functional nanocomposites were prepared by the co-precipitation method using natural tourmaline (XY(3)Z(6)Si(6)O(18)(BO3)(3)V3W, where X is Na+, Ca2+, K+, or vacancy; Y is Mg2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, Al3+, Fe3+, Mn3+, Cr3+, Li+, or Ti4+; Z is Al3+, Mg2+, Cr3+, or V3+; V is O2-, OH-; and W is O2-, OH-, or F-) powders, ammonium cerium(IV) nitrate and zirconium(IV) nitrate pentahydrate as raw materials. The reference sample, tourmaline modified with ammonium cerium(IV) nitrate alone was also prepared by a similar precipitation route. The results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy show that tourmaline modified with Ce and Zr has a better far-infrared emission property than tourmaline modified with Ce alone. Through characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the mechanism for oxygen evolution during the heat process in the two composite materials was systematically studied. The XPS spectra show that Fe3+ ratio inside tourmaline modified with Ce alone can be raised by doping Zr. Moreover, it is showed that there is a higher Ce3+ ratio inside the tourmaline modified with Ce and Zr than tourmaline modified with Ce alone. In addition, XRD results indicate the formation of CeO2 and Ce1-xZrxO2 crystallites during the heat treatment and further TEM observations show they exist as nanoparticles on the surface of tourmaline powders. Based on these results, we attribute the improved far-infrared emission properties of Ce-Zr doped tourmaline to the enhanced unit cell shrinkage of the tourmaline arisen from much more oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ inside the tourmaline caused by the change in the catalyst redox properties of CeO2 brought about by doping with Zr4+. In all samples, tourmaline modified with 7.14 wt.% Ce and 1.86 wt.% Zr calcined at 800 degrees C for 5 h has the best far-infrared emission property with the maximum emissivity value of 98%.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0217-9849	1793-6640		WOS:000364504900002

Photoinhibited PSII centres diffuse laterally from the grana core region of the thylakoid membrane to the stroma lamellae in order to allow replacement of damaged proteins and cofactors. The 'new born' PSII centres in this region are characterized by the absence of the water splitting capacity and very poor ability to bind the secondary quinone acceptor, Q(B). After the repair process PSII has to regain the water splitting capacity. This requires a set of well-defined electron transfer reactions leading to assembly of the Mn-cluster. In order to minimize the danger of photoinhibition during these earlier stages of photoactivation of PSII, auxiliary donors to the primary donor P680(+), such as redox active tyrosine on D2 protein, Y-D,Y- and cytochrome b(559) become involved in the electron transport reactions by providing necessary electrons. Cytochrome b(559) may also serve as an electron acceptor to Q(A)(-) if elevated light intensities occur during the photoactivation process. These reactions lead to activation of Q(B) binding, and finally to the assembly of the Mn-cluster. All these electron transport events occur simultaneously with the lateral movement of PSII centres back to the appressed regions of the grana core, where the pool of the most active PSII is situated.									19	0	0	0	17	0	19			0031-9317	1399-3054		WOS:000185842800004

The rationally designed electrocatalyst has a unique structure, with nanosized WC and Fe3W3C uniformly dispersed in a three-dimensional porous carbon framework. WC, which was thought difficult to produce, is successfully prepared at a relatively low temperature of about 750 degrees C at an inert atmosphere. XRD studies demonstrate the self-assisted effect of Fe, which accelerates the formation of WC, getting around the pathway of direct carbonaceous reduction of tungsten by carbon. The porous iron-tungsten carbide (Fe-W-C) nanocomposite as electrocatalyst shows excellent ORR activity with the onset and half-wave potentials of 0.864 and 0.727 V (vs RHE), respectively, which are close to those of Pt/C (0.976 and 0.820 V vs RHE). Electrochemical measurements show that Fe-W-C follows almost the effective four-electron-transfer pathway and would not be disturbed by methanol. The presence of a protective graphite shell outside the active carbide cores substantially improves the durability of the electrocatalyst. Both the removal of Fe species and the absence of W species would severely degrade the activity, while halide ions Cl- and sulfur-containing species SCN-can significantly suppress the ORR activity by the blocking of Fe species. These facts indicate that the ORR active species of Fe-W-C should be relevant to both W and Fe species.									35	3	0	0	1	0	36			1944-8244			WOS:000393355900053	28068063

X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal the atomic dispersion of Ru on the Ti3C2Tx MXene support and the successful coordination of Ru-SA with the N and S species on the Ti3C2Tx MXene. The resultant Ru-SA-N-S-Ti3C2Tx catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 76 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, it is shown that integrating the Ru-SA-N-S-Ti3C2Tx catalyst on n(+)np(+)-Si photocathode enables photoelectrochemical hydrogen production with exceptionally high photocurrent density of 37.6 mA cm(-2) that is higher than the reported precious Pt and other noble metals catalysts coupled to Si photocathodes. Density functional theory calculations suggest that Ru-SA coordinated with N and S sites on the Ti3C2Tx MXene support is the origin of this enhanced HER activity. This work would extend the possibility of using the MXene family as a solid support for the rational design of various single atom catalysts.									211	19	0	0	5	0	215			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000490755400001	31621970

Annealing of thin catalyst film was done at 600 degrees C and growth of CNTs at a relatively low temperature (700 degrees C). A small amount of pure distilled water (0.04 sccm) was introduced without assistance of carrier gas such as Ar or He during the growth. Initially, water vapor enhances the crystallinity of growing nanotubes and their length increases with growth time. However, the presence of water vapor gradually changes their structure from multiwall to thinner or even single wall carbon nanotubes. After a certain growth time, the growth rate becomes slow and structural disorder start to increase. The electrochemical properties of the obtained ultra-long CNTs forests were analyzed by transferring them on adhesive conductive aluminum tape using a novel methodology. In addition, a water plasma treatment was performed in order to introduce oxygen functional groups on the transferred CNTs (CNTs/Al). The specific capacitance of CNTs/Al increases from 87 to 148 Fg(-1) for untreated and water plasma treated CNTs/Al, respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The utilization of ammonium ions during catalyst synthesis and subsequent calcination led to successful formation of nitrogen-doped nanotubular titanates with lower sodium content, favored titanate-to-anatase transformation and enhanced textural, morphological and interface properties. The photocatalytic tests revealed that hydrogen production activity of nitrogen-doped titanates is ten times higher compared to nitrogen- free titanates. The presence of highly photoactive anatase phase, improved anatase crystallinity and lower amount of sodium ions are found to be decisive factors for increased hydrogen production activity. The optimal nickel loading was determined and the variation in photocatalytic activity with reduction temperature was explained.

As animal models, amphibians offer several advantages that include a well-understood basic physiology, a taxonomic diversity well suited to comparative studies, tolerance to temperature and oxygen variation, and a greater similarity to humans than many other currently popular animal models. Amphibians now account for similar to 1/4 to 1/3 of lower vertebrate and invertebrate research, and this proportion is especially true in physiological research, as evident from the high profile of amphibians as animal models in Nobel Prize research. Currently, amphibians play prominent roles in research in the physiology of musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, renal, respiratory, reproductive, and sensory systems. Amphibians are also used extensively in physiological studies aimed at generating new insights in evolutionary biology, especially in the investigation of the evolution of air breathing and terrestriality. Environmental physiology also utilizes amphibians, ranging from studies of cryoprotectants for tissue preservation to physiological reactions to hypergravity and space exploration. Amphibians are also playing a key role in studies of environmental endocrine disruptors that are having disproportionately large effects on amphibian populations and where specific species can serve as sentinel species for environmental pollution. Finally, amphibian genera such as Xenopus, a genus relatively well understood metabolically and physiologically, will continue to contribute increasingly in this new era of systems biology and "X-omics."									64	3	0	0	59	1	67			1084-2020	1930-6180		WOS:000247112200008	17592189

It is therefore important to quantify water at the cathode, but CO2 electrolyzers are typically enclosed systems where only the inputs and outputs can be readily measured. We report herein an analytical CO2RR electrolyzer with sensors in the cathode chamber to directly measure the relative humidity (RH) and temperature during electrolysis. These measurements enable the flow of water to be tracked inside the flow cell, and provide the boundary conditions necessary for a 3D model of mass transport and fluid flow in the cathode chamber. We developed a 3D model which showed that the molar fraction of water at the cathodic GDE/membrane interface, x(H2O,mem), is constant under a range of applied current densities (25-200 mA cm(-2)) and CO2 flow rates (25-200 sccm), and does not change as a function of humidification of the CO2 feed. The value of x(H2O,mem) is held at parity because more water is drawn across the membrane (from the liquid-fed anode) when insufficient water is supplied to the cathode from the CO2 feed. This result points to a higher flux of water across the membrane when using drier CO2 feedstocks at higher flow rates and higher current densities. Consequently, undesirable anolyte crossover (which causes salt precipitation at the cathode) can be suppressed by maintaining a humidified CO2 feed. This 3D model can be used for a range of operating conditions, materials, and flow fields to help with CO2RR electrolyzer design and optimization.									28	0	0	0	0	0	28			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000599751100039

As a polymeric semiconductor, graphitic carbon nitride g-C3N4 has been regarded as a next-generation photocatalyst due to its appealing band structure and excellent physicochemical stability. However, low electron conductivity and weak visible light absorption hinder its practical application. In this work, for the first time, we rationally designed a new graphitic carbon nitride, g-C9N10, based on a self-doping strategy by substituting the C3N3 ring for bridging the N atom in g-C3N4. g-C9N10 exhibits higher electron conductivity and longer wavelength absorption than those of g-C3N4, which make it a highly photoactive photocatalyst. Moreover, on the basis of "acceptance and donation" mechanism, single boron atom-decorated g-C9N10 (B@g-C9N10) can act as an efficient metal-free photocatalyst for nitrogen reduction reactions (NRRs) with high faradaic efficiency. Our results demonstrate that B@g-C9N10 can effectively activate and reduce N-2 to NH3 with a low overpotential of 0.22 V, while the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is efficiently suppressed. In addition, the photo-generated external potential is adequate to drive the NRR, endowing B@g-C9N10 with spontaneous NRR capability under visible/infrared light irradiation. This work may provide a new strategy for designing photocatalysts with high photoactivity and proposes g-C9N10 as a promising platform for designing efficient photocatalysts, which is expected to motivate more research efforts to explore.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000688134800001

The LOC is considered to represent supra-subduction zone (SSZ) oceanic lithosphere, but also preserves evidence of pre-SSZ magmatic processes. Here we combine field and microstructural observations with mineral chemical and structural analyses of different minerals from the major lithologies of the LOC. Wehrlite and websterite bodies in both the mantle and lower crust contain clinopyroxene likely formed at a pre-SSZ stage, characterised by high Al, high Cr, low Mg crystal cores. These clinopyroxenes also exhibit low Al, low Cr, high Mg outer rims and intracrystalline dissolution surfaces, indicative of reactive melt percolation during intrusion and disruption of these lithologies by later, SSZ-related, dunite-forming magmas. Chromian-spinel compositional variations correlate with lithology; dunite-chromitite Cr-spinels are characterised by relatively uniform and high TiO2 and Al2O3, indicating formation by melt-rock reaction associated with SSZ processes. Harzburgite Cr-spinel compositions are more variable but preserve a relatively high Al2O3, low TiO2 endmember that may reflect crystallisation in a pre-SSZ oceanic spreading centre setting. An important finding of this study is that the LOC potentially preserves the petrological signature of a transition between oceanic spreading centre processes and subsequent SSZ magmatism. Single crystal Cr-spinel Fe3+/Sigma Fe ratios calculated on the basis of stoichiometry (from electron microprobe [EPMA] and crystal structural [X-ray diffraction; XRD] measurements) correlate variably with those calculated by point-source (single crystal) Mossbauer spectroscopy. Average sample EPMA Fe3+/Sigma Fe ratios overestimate or underestimate the Mossbauer-derived values for harzburgites, and always overestimate the Mossbauer Fe3+/Sigma Fe ratios for dunites and chromitites. The highest Fe3+/Sigma Fe ratios, irrespective of method of measurement, are therefore generally associated with dunites and chromitites, and yield calculated log(fO(2))(FMQ) values of up to similar to + 1.8. While this lends support to the formation of the dunites and chromitites during SSZ-related melt percolation in the lower part of the LOC, it also suggests that these melts were not highly oxidised, compared to typical arc basalts (fO(2)(FMQ) of > + 2). This may in turn reflect the early (forearc) stage of subduction zone activity preserved by the LOC and implies that some of the arc tholeiitic and boninitic lava compositions preserved in the upper portion of the ophiolite are not genetically related to the mantle and lower crustal rocks, against which they exhibit tectonic contacts. Our new data also have implications for the use of ophiolite chromitites as recorders of mantle oxidation state through time; a global comparison suggests that the Fe3+/Sigma Fe signatures of ophiolite chromitites are likely to have more to do with local environmental petrogenetic conditions in sub-arc systems than large length-scale mantle chemical evolution									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0022-3530	1460-2415		WOS:000745050100009		
J	Ignatova, Katya; Popov, Iliyan								Structure and electrocatalytic ability of Sn-Ni alloy powders prepared by direct and pulse electrodeposition								MATERIALS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS				263						124410	10.1016/j.matchemphys.2021.124410		FEB 2021		APR 15 2021	2021	Sn-Ni alloy powders with a wide range of compositions and structures by constant current, constant potential and pulse potential modes were deposited. Increasing the Ni2+/Sn2+ ratio in the electrolyte from 1 to 8 in both stationary modes leads to changes in the shape and composition of the powder particles from typically dendritic (5 divided by 7 wt%Ni), to cauliflower-like (90 divided by 98 wt%Ni). With only an increase of the pulse frequency from 100 to 1000 Hz, almost 20% increase in the nickel content is achieved. The Sn-Ni powders deposited in both potentiostatic modes have much more homogeneous structure than those, deposited by galvanostatic mode. The powders are composed mainly from a cubic phase (f.c.c.) of beta-Ni and of small amounts of beta-Sn as a result of recrystallization from metastable amorphous tin phase. The Sn-Ni powders show electrocatalytic alility to the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in a model Metal-Air system seriously excel features of the reference (Ag) catalyst. The ORR is very sensitive to the morphology of the tested electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000632968800001

Here we show the first whole cell double oxidation of n-heptane to produce chiral alcohols and heptanones. The concept of an artificial operon for co-expression of a monooxygenase from Bacillus megaterium (P450 BM3) and an alcohol dehydrogenase (RE-ADH) from Rhodococcus erythropolis is reported and compared to the widely used two-plasmid or Duetvector expression systems. Both catalysts are co-expressed on a polycistronic constructs (single mRNA) that reduces recombinant DNA content and metabolic burden for the host cell, therefore increasing growth rate and expression level. Using the artificial operon system, the expression of P450 BM3 reached 81 mg g(-1) cell dry weight. In addition, in situ cofactor regeneration through the P450 BM3/RE-ADH couple was enhanced by coupling to glucose oxidation by E. coli. Under optimized reaction conditions the artificial operon system displayed a product formation of 656 mg L-1(5.7 mM) of reaction products (heptanols + heptanones), which is 3-fold higher than the previously reported values for an in vitro oxidation cascade. In conjunction with the high product concentrations it was possible to obtain ee values of >99% for (S)-3-heptanol. Coexpression of a third alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus brevis (Lb-ADH) in the same host yielded complete oxidation of all heptanol isomers. Introduction of a second ADH enabled further to utilize both cofactors in the host cell (NADH and NADPH) which illustrates the simplicity and modular character of the whole cell oxidation concept employing an artificial operon system.

By integrating theory and experiments, we achieved an in-situ regulation of formic acid oxidation on a Pt (1 1 1) surface via externally applied strains. The first-principles theory predicted that compressive strains can lower the reaction overpotential to boost the formate pathway and alleviate CO poisoning on the Pt surface, while tensile strains should have the opposite effects. The experimental observations confirmed the theoretical predictions. Compressive elastic strains (approximately -0.4%) could create over 75 mV overpotential decrease, far beyond what was achieved in previous works. A mass activity (similar to 700 mA/mg) of Pt was achieved in a broad potential range of 0.4-0.85 V (vs RHE) under compressive strains. There was no evident activity loss during the chronoamperometry test at 0.6 V. The first-principles theory, controlled synthesis and in-situ measurements were combined to achieve active control, which represents important progress in tuning the electrocatalytic activity of formic acid oxidation.

J	Papakonstantinou, Georgios; Sundmacher, Kai								H-2 permeation through N117 and its consumption by IrOx in PEM water electrolyzers								ELECTROCHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS				108						106578	10.1016/j.elecom.2019.106578				NOV 2019	2019	It is considered that the oxidation activity of Ir based anodes on H-2 permeating the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) in PEM water electrolyzers (WE) is poor, resulting in high H-2-in-O-2 contents at idle or dynamic operating conditions, especially with asymmetric pressure. In the present work, the dependence of H-2 permeation on cathode pressure was quantified by the pressure drop method. H-2 consumption was detected by chronoamperometry at potentials preceding water splitting. The addition of N-2 in the anode outlet gas allowed the on-line monitoring of the mixture composition during idle PEMWE operation by a thermal conductivity sensor. It is found that H-2 is effectively consumed with IrOx oxyhydroxide anodes at low current densities, with 75% conversion of the zero-current permeation at cathode pressure of 5 bar and 60 degrees C. Hence, both H-2-in-O-2 content and lowest current density at which the H-2-in-O-2 flammability limit is not exceeded decrease by more than 50%. Current density corrections accounting for H-2 consumption and mass transport potential corrections accounting for the enhancement of H-2 permeation with current density were implemented. The resulting Tafel slope values suggest that the rate determining step of the oxygen evolution reaction with IrOx oxyhydroxides is a chemical step.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000493897300009

The solubility limit has been found to be equal to 7% and 19 at % for zinc and iron, respectively. Zinc has little effect on the structure which remains orthorhombic throughout all the zinc concentration range, while iron induces an important structural modification (tweed structure formation). Both impurities induce grain-growth inhibition but densification appears to be independent of the impurity content with respect to the undoped material. However, iodometry shows that the oxygen stoichiometry decreases in zinc-doped samples while it increases in iron-doped samples. Charge balance resulting from the dopant charge and the evolution of the copper charge with doping have been invoked. In zinc-doped samples, the copper charge excess (copper charge fraction > 2) decreases sharply for 0.0 less than or equal to y < 0.04, then it shows a plateaulike behaviour for 0.04 less than or equal to y < 0.06, while in iron-doped samples, it decreases almost monotonically. Confirming some of our previous results there is a correlated T-c decrease in the case of zinc-doped samples (occurrence of a T-c plateau) and in the case of iron-doped samples (quasi monotonical decrease). This difference has been interpreted in terms of structural changes related to the different substitution behaviour of zinc and iron.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0022-2461			WOS:A1994PP29800028

After carbonization of Zn-Co-ZIF-n/PAN nanofibers (n was the molar ratio of Zn/Co before carbonization), the core layer was converted to nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (NCNFs) and the shell layer was converted to Zn/Co bimetal nanoparticles coated with graphitic carbon layer (Zn/Co@C). It was found that Zn/Co@C-NCNFs are featured with hierarchical network structure and high surface area. Further doped by nitrogen species and embedded by Zn/Co bimetal nanoparticles, it exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), better than the reference samples. By further investigating the electrocatalytic performance, the optimized sample Zn/Co@C-NCNFs (0.50) derived from Zn-Co-ZIF-0.50/PAN at 800 degrees C carbonization exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity (the onset and half-wave potentials were -0.099 V and -0.20 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively and nearly four electron selectivity (3.69)). Moreover, its methanol tolerance and duration stability was better than that of the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. It provides an effective strategy to design non-precious metal electrocatalysts from the Zn-Co-ZIF-n/PAN nanofibers or other MOFs/polymer nanofibers for ORR in fuel cells. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, because of the undesirable electron accumulation at the surface, the overall water-splitting efficiency is seriously restricted by the poor charge separation/transfer ability. Here, an all-organic donor-acceptor (D-A) system through crafting carbon rings units-conjugated tubular graphitic carbon nitride (C-TCN) is proposed. Through a range of characterizations and theoretical calculations, the incorporation of carbon rings units via continuous pi-conjugated bond builds a D-A system, which can drive intramolecular charge transfer to realize highly efficient charge separation. More importantly, the tubular structure and the incorporated carbon rings units cause a significant downshift of the valence band, of which the potential is beneficial to the activation for O-2 evolution. When serving as photocatalyst for overall water splitting, C-TCN displays considerable performance with H-2 and O-2 production rates of 204.6 and 100.8 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), respectively. The corresponding external quantum efficiency reaches 2.6% at 405 nm, and still remains 1.7% at 420 nm. This work demonstrates that the all-organic D-A system conceptualized from organic solar cell can offer promotional effect for overall water splitting by addressing the charge accumulation problem rooted in the hydrogen evolution reaction.									46	3	0	0	4	0	46			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000587670300001	33169530

In this contribution, a comparison was made between two approaches to modeling the electron kinetics of electron thermalization in atmospheric pressure helium plasma with an oxygen admixture. Modeling based on the direct solution of the local time-dependent electron Boltzmann equation was compared with modeling based on the commonly used but less general local mean energy approximation. For modeling based on the local time-dependent electron Boltzmann equation, a temporary faster decay in the population of electrons in the high energy tail and a slower decay in the population of intermediate energy electrons were observed while the electron swarm cooled from an average energy of above 8 eV, without an electric field present. During that period, the electron impact reaction rate coefficients of helium direct ionization and electronic excitation decreased by more than three orders of magnitude as compared to the modeling based on the local mean energy approximation. Global modeling of the evolution of plasma species densities in response to an electric field typical of atmospheric pressure pulsed discharges was performed with the two approaches to electron kinetics. Differences in the species densities were observed between the two approaches, with a 100% increase in the maximum density of electrons found with the modeling based on the local mean energy approximation.

Monitoring the early stages of growth of GQDs reveals that the in-plane epoxy (C-O-C) functional groups attached at the defect sites essentially cut the oxidized GOs into small pieces of GQDs during the hydrothermal reaction. By conducting a series of controlled annealing experiments under oxygen and hydrogen gas environments, we monitor and quantify the inter-conversion of edge states and functional groups in GQDs from Raman and photoluminescence (PL) studies. The deconvolution of the Raman spectrum allowed us to monitor the evolution of new Raman bands at B1260 and B1438 cm(-1), which are assigned to the edge functional groups. Through the fitting of the PL spectra and a quantitative analysis of integrated intensities of PL, we unambiguously assign the blue PL emission bands at B407 and B440 nm to zigzag and armchair free edge states in GQDs, respectively, for the first time. On the other hand, the green emission bands at B490 and B530 nm are attributed to COOH/ C-OH and CQO/C-O edge functional groups, respectively. Our conclusions are corroborated by XPS and FTIR spectroscopic analyses of the as-grown and annealed GQDs.									117	3	0	0	6	0	119			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000389668400013

Of the three treatments (i.e. Cu, UV-B and Cu+UV-B) tested, the UV-B treatment of Cu-pretreated Anabaena produced a greater inhibition of oxygen evolution, C-14 fixation, ATP and NADPH contents than UV-B alone. Proteomic analysis using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE), MALDI-TOF MS/MS and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of Cu, UV-B, and Cu+UV-B treated Anabaena exhibited significant and reproducible alterations in 12 proteins. Of these, manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), iron superoxide dismutase (Fe-SOD) and peroxiredoxin (PER) are antioxidative enzymes; ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCo), phosphoribulokinase (PRK), flavodoxin (Flv), plastocyanin (PLC), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), phycocyanin (PC) and phycoerythrocyanin alpha-chain (PC alpha-chain) are linked with photosynthesis and respiration; and DnaK and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) are associated with cellular processes and light signalling, respectively. However, when subjected to a high dose of UV-B, Cu-pretreated Anabaena depicted a severe down-regulation of DnaK, NDPK and Flv, probably because of inevitable oxidative stress. Thus, the augmentation of UV-B toxicity by Cu can be attributed to the down-regulation of DnaK, NDPK and Flv.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			1445-4408	1445-4416		WOS:000257516300002	32688793

This work reports the preparation and the physico-chemical and electrochemical characterization of spin -coated (SC) films of commercial Mn2O3, Mn3O4 and MnO2 powders. Spin coating consists of few preparation steps and employs green chemicals (i.e., ethanol, acetic acid, polyethylene oxide and water). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time SC has been used for the preparation of stable powder -based WOCs electrodes. For comparison, MnOx films were also prepared by means of electrodeposition (ED) and tested under the same conditions, at neutral pH. Particular interest was given to alpha-Mn2O3-based films, since Mn (III) species play a crucial role in the electrocatalytic oxidation of water. To this end, MnO2-based SC and ED films were calcined at 500 degrees C, in order to obtain the desired alpha-Mn2O3 crystalline phase. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed to study both electrode charge transport properties and electrode electrolyte charge transfer kinetics. Long-term stability tests and oxygen/hydrogen evolution measurements were also made on the highest -performing samples and their faradaic efficiencies were quantified, with results higher than 95% for the Mn2O3 SC film, finally showing that the SC technique proposed here is a simple and reliable method to study the electrocatalytic behavior of pre -synthesized WOCs powders.									27	0	0	0	2	0	27			1996-1944			WOS:000375158900082	28773419	
J	Dong, Feng; Zhang, Han-Min; Yang, Feng-Lin								[Modeling formation of aerobic granule and influence of hydrodynamic shear forces on granule diameter].								Huan jing ke xue= Huanjing kexue				33	1			181	90						2012-Jan	2012	A one-dimension aerobic granule mathematical model was established, basing on mathematical biofilm model and activated sludge model. The model was used to simulate simple aerobic granule process such as nutrients removal, granule diameter evolution, cycle performance as well as depth profiles of DO and biomass. The effluent NH4(+) -N concentration decreased as the modeling processed. The simulation effluent NO3(-)-N concentration decreased to 3 mg x L(-1) as the granules grew. While the granule diameter increased from 1.1 mm on day 30 to 2.5 mm on day 100, the TN removal efficiency increased from less than 10% to 91%. The denitrification capacity was believed to enhance because the anoxic zone would be enlarged with the increasing granule diameter. The simultaneous nitrification and denitrification occurred inside the big aerobic granules. The oxygen permeating depth increased with the consumption of substrate. It was about 100-200 microm at the beginning of the aeration phase, and it turned to near 800 microm at the end of reaction. The autotrophs (AOB and NOB) were mostly located at the out layer where the DO concentration was high. The heterotrophic bacteria were distributed through the whole granule. As hydrodynamic shear coefficient k(de) increased from 0.25 (m x d)(-1) to 5 (m x d)(-1), the granule diameter under steady state decreased form 3.5 mm to 1.8 mm. The granule size under the dynamic steady-state decreased with the increasing hydrodynamic shear force. The granule size could be controlled by adjusting aeration intensity.									1	6	0	0	5	0	7			0250-3301			MEDLINE:22452208	22452208

A light-intensity study of the Cl--free membranes showed that all PS II centers were able tn evolve oxygen at about 35% of the control rate when measured in Cl--free medium. The Cl--depleted membranes were immediately (< 15 s) reactivated to 85-90% of the original activity by the addition of fairly high concentrations of Cl- (K-d = 0.5 mM), but both Cl- and the activity were promptly lost when the membranes immediately after reactivation were diluted in a Cl--free medium. However, stabilization of Cl--binding could be accomplished by prolonged incubation in the presence of Cl-. The transition to stable binding, followed using Cl-36(-), occurred over several minutes. The stable binding was further characterized by a K-d Of 20 mu M and a t(1/2) for dissociation of about 1 h [Lindberg et al. (1993) Photosynth. Res. 38, 401-408]. The effects on S-2 signals of removal of Cl- were studied using EPR. The depletion of Cl- was accompanied by a shift in intensity toward the g = 4.1 signal at the expense of the multiline signal. When Cl- or Br- but not F- was added to the depleted PS II membranes, the original distribution of the signals was immediately (< 30 s) restored, We propose that Cl--binding responsible for high oxygen-evolution activity and normal EPR properties of the S-2 State may occur either as high affinity (K-d = 20 mu M) and slowly exchanging (t(1/2) = 1 h), or as low affinity (K-d = 0.5 mM) and rapidly exchanging (t(1/2) < 15 s). Our results suggest that Br- but not F- has a mode of binding similar to that of Cl-. The high-affinity state is the normal state of binding, but once Cl- has been removed, it will first rebind as low-affinity, rapidly exchanging followed by conversion into a high-affinity, slowly exchanging mode of binding.									93	2	1	0	62	0	95			0006-2960			WOS:A1996VT08100025	8916911

In this study, a novel in situ defect engineering route to maximize electrocatalytic redox activity of inorganic nanosheet is developed by using holey nanostructured substrate with strong interfacial electronic coupling. Density functional theory calculations and in situ spectroscopic analyses confirm that efficient interfacial charge transfer takes place between holey TiN and Ni-Fe-layered double hydroxide (LDH), leading to the feedback formation of nitrogen vacancies and a maximization of cation redox activity. The holey TiN-LDH nanohybrid is found to exhibit a superior functionality as an oxygen electrocatalyst and electrode for Li-O-2 batteries compared to its non-holey homologues. The great impact of hybridization-driven vacancy introduction on the electrochemical performance originates from an efficient electrochemical activation of both Fe and Ni ions during electrocatalytic process, a reinforcement of interfacial electronic coupling, an increase in electrochemical active sites, and an improvement in electrocatalysis/charge-transfer kinetics.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6				2198-3844		WOS:000712087200001	34713617

In addition, flexible sodium-ion batteries may be able to satisfy the demands of large-scale energy storage applications for portable, wearable, and flexible electronics. Compared to the development of cathode materials, the progress on anode materials has been relatively slow. Therefore, the exploration of low-cost anode materials with high Na+ storage capacity is very important. Herein, we present oxygen-deficient Na2Ti3O7 nanobelts grown on carbon cloth (CC) as a promising novel flexible anode material for SIBs. Free-standing Na2Ti3O7 nanobelts with oxygen vacancies were directly grown on CC through a simple hydrothermal and thermal reduction process. Benefiting from the improved conductivity and increased active sites after the introduction of oxygen vacancies, the new material exhibits a high reversible capacity of 100 mAh.cm(-2) at 200 mA.cm(-2), with almost 80% capacitance retention after 200 cycles. When the current density was increased to 400 mA.cm(-2), a high capacity of 69.7 mAh.cm(-2) was achieved, which is three times that of bare Na2Ti3O7 nanobelts on CC. This 3D oxygen-deficient electrode can significantly promote the transport of Na+ ions and electrons, leading to remarkably improved electrochemical properties. Furthermore, this work constitutes a promising strategy to rationally design and fabricate novel Na2Ti3O7-based anodes with enhanced capacitive behavior, which hold great promise for energy storage/conversion devices, facilitating the large-scale implementation of high-performance flexible SIBs.									8	3	0	0	0	0	9			1000-6818			WOS:000423693100015

The time evolution and final state distribution of the OH products from vibrational predissociation have been evaluated by ultraviolet probe laser-induced fluorescence measurements. The half-collision scattering takes place with similar to 3350 cm(-1) of energy available to the OH (v =1)+ o-H-2 products, an energy that exceeds the classical barrier to reaction. The OH (v=1) products are preferentially populated in high rotational levels with a distribution that is consistent with an energy gap law. A significant fraction of the OH fragments are promoted to the excited spin-orbit state in the predissociation process. A strong lambda-doubler propensity is also found, indicating that the OH unpaired p pi orbital is preferentially aligned perpendicular to the rotational plane of the OH products. Finally, the OH rotational and fine structure distributions are compared with those obtained in previous full collision inelastic scattering studies at energies below the threshold for reaction.

Coatings with a structure of plasma-sprayed BNT/yttria-partially stabilized zirconia (YSZ) double ceramic coat and a high-velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF)-sprayed bond coat were fabricated. The thermal shock behavior of the coatings was investigated, and the phase composition and microstructure evolution of the BNT/YSZ coatings were characterized. The results showed that the BNT powder had single perovskite structure that remained unchanged after sintering at 1500 degrees C for 100h. The average CTE of the BNT ceramic at 25-1400 degrees C was found to be 10.2x10(-6)K(-1), comparable to that of YSZ. The thermal conductivity at 1200 degrees C was found to be 2.56Wm(-1)K(-1). During thermal shock, the BNT/YSZ coatings spalled layer by layer, which can be attributed to the compositional deviation combined with the large temperature gradient in the BNT coating.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1059-9630	1544-1016		WOS:000452893200029

However, such catalysts often suffer from thermal instability due to coarsening of Pt nanoparticles at elevated temperatures, especially for those with high Pt loading, which leads to severe deterioration of catalytic performances. Here, a facile strategy is developed to improve the thermal stability of ultrafine (1-2 nm)-Pt/CeO2 catalysts with high Pt content (approximate to 14 wt%) by partially embedding Pt nanoparticles at the surface of CeO2 through the redox reaction at the solid-solution interface. Ex situ heating studies demonstrate the significant increase in thermal stability of such embedded nanostructures compared to the conventional loaded catalysts. The microscopic pathways for interparticle coarsening of Pt embedded or loaded on CeO2 are further investigated by in situ electron microscopy at elevated temperatures. Their morphology and size evolution with heating temperature indicate that migration and coalescence of Pt nanoparticles are remarkably suppressed in the embedded structure up to about 450 degrees C, which may account for the improved thermal stability compared to the conventional loaded structure.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			2198-3844			WOS:000411148100016	28932665

The formation of H2O2 was light dependent with a production of 1.2 mu mol . g FW-1. h(-1) in sea water (pH 8.2) at an irradiance of 700 mu mol photons m(-2). s(-1). The excretion was also pH dependent: in pH 6.5 the production was not detectable (< 5 nmol . g FW-1. h(-1)) but at pH 9.0 the production was 5.0 mu mol . g FW(-1)h(-1). The production of H2O2 was totally inhibited by 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU). The ability of U. rigida growing in tanks (750 1) under a natural light regime to excrete H2O2 was checked and found to be seven times higher at 08.00 hours than other times of the day. The H2O2 concentration in the cultivation tank (density: 2 g FW . 1(-1)) reached the highest value (3 mu M) at 11.00 hours. Photosynthesis was not influenced by H2O2 formation. The H2O2 is suggested to come from the Mehler reaction (pseudocyclic photophosphorylation). With an oxygen evolution of 120 mmol . g FW(-1)h(-1) at pH8.2 and 90 mmol . g FW-1. h(-1) at pH 9.0, 0.5% and 2.7% of the electrons were used for extracellular H2O2 production. The H2O2 production is sufficiently high to be of physiological and ecological significance, and is suggested to be a part of the defence against epi- and endophytes.									74	7	0	0	65	0	81			0032-0935	1432-2048		WOS:A1995QY57900005

The essential feature of all is that analysis of trace gases can be accomplished either in the gas phase or those released from surfaces, crucially avoiding sample collection or modification. In this regard, selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry, SIFT-MS, also performs ambient analyses both accurately and rapidly. In this focused review we describe the underlying ion chemistry underpinning SIFT-MS through a discourse on the reactions of different classes of organic and inorganic molecules with H3O+, NO+ and O-2(+center dot) studied using the SIFT technique. Rate coefficients and ion products of these reactions facilitate absolute SIFT-MS analyses and can also be useful for the interpretation of data obtained by the other ambient analysis methods mentioned above. The essential physics and flow dynamics of SIFT-MS are described that, together with the reaction kinetics, allow SIFT-MS to perform absolute ambient analyses of trace compounds in humid atmospheric air, exhaled breath and the headspace of aqueous liquids. Several areas of research that, through pilot experiments, are seen to benefit from ambient gas analysis using SIFT-MS are briefly reviewed. Special attention is given to exhaled breath and urine headspace analysis directed towards clinical diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring, and some other areas researched using SIFT-MS are summarised. Finally, extensions to current areas of application and indications of other directions in which SIFT-MS can be exploited for ambient analysis are alluded to.									90	0	0	0	33	0	91			0003-2654	1364-5528		WOS:000289896000001	21431189

We have formulated a continuum-level chemo-thermomechanically coupled theory which integrates these various nonlinear phenomena. We have numerically implemented our coupled theory in a finite-element program, and have also calibrated the material parameters in our theory for an Fe-22Cr-4.8Al-0.3Y heat-resistant alloy experimentally studied by Tolpygo et al. Using our theory, we simulate the high-temperature oxidation of thin sheets of FeCrAlY and show that our theory is capable of reproducing the oxide thickness evolution with time at different temperatures, the permanent extensional changes in dimensions of the base material being oxidized and the development of large compressive residual stresses in the protective surface oxide which forms. As an application of our numerical simulation capability, we also consider the oxidation of an FeCrAlY sheet with an initial groove-like surface undulation, a geometry which has been experimentally studied by Davis and Evans. Our numerical simulations reproduce (with reasonable accuracy) the shape-distortion of the groove upon oxidation measured by these authors. This example has obvious ramifications for delamination failure of a ceramic topcoat on a thermally grown oxide layer in thermal barrier coatings. (c) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

Constraining their origin, composition, and the interactions they underwent during their subsequent evolution is therefore essential to discuss the sources of magmatism in a given area. Pyroxenites could represent either recycling of crustal rocks in mantle domains or mantle originated rocks (formed either by olivine consuming melt-rock reactions or by crystal fractionation). Petrological and geochemical (major and trace elements, Sr-Nd and 0 isotopes) features of xenoliths from various occurrences (French Massif-Central, Jordan, Morocco and Cameroon) show that these samples represent cumulates crystallized during melt percolation at mantle conditions. They formed in mantle domains at pressures of 1-2 GPa during post-collisional magmatism (possibly Hercynian for the French Massif-Central, and Panafrican for Morocco, Jordan and Cameroon). The thermal re-equilibration of lithospheric domains, typical of the late orogenic exhumation stages, is also recorded by the samples. Most of the samples display a metasomatic overprint that may be either inherited or likely linked to the recent volcanic activity that occurred in the investigated regions.The crystallization of pyroxenites during late orogenic events has implications for the subsequent evolution of the mantle domains. The presence of large amounts of mantle pyroxenites in old orogenic regions indeed imparts peculiar physical and chemical characteristics to these domains. Among others, the global solidus temperature of the whole lithospheric domain will be lowered; in turn, this implies that old orogenic regions are refertilized zones where magmatic activity would be enhanced.

The nanocomposites are characterized using a combination of techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), positron annihilation lifetime measurement, spectroscopy techniques, and femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. In comparison to bare CdS NWs, the NiCo2S4/CdS nanocomposites exhibit enhanced visible light hydrogen production, with an optimal rate reaching 20.0 mmol.h(-1).g(-1). The experimental results, in conjunction with theoretical electronic structure calculations, reveal that the enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction activities can be attributed to the formation of Schottky junction between NiCo2S4 NPs and CdS NWs that facilitates photogenerated electron transfer from CdS to NiCo2S4. Meanwhile, the NiCo2S4, as a metallic cocatalyst, increases the electron density and active sites desired for H-2 evolution.									39	4	0	0	5	0	40			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000487764800031

Although significant efforts have been made, the practical application of metal-CO2 battery techniques is still restricted by various tremendous challenges, namely high charge potential, poor rate capability, and reversibility. This review seeks to present a realistic assessment of the most advanced metal-CO2 systems to identify problems, and opportunities to conquer these challenges. The recent progress on understanding the reaction mechanism of CO2 reduction/evolution, cathode materials, electrocatalysts design strategies, interface construction of metal anode/electrolyte, and the role of electrolytes are systematically reviewed and discussed. Meanwhile, high-performance electrode design principles and interface construction methods are also proposed. The effect of electrolyte and the difference between the nonaqueous and aqueous electrolyte systems in the context of the reaction mechanism, catalyst selection, metal anode protection, and corresponding enhancement strategies are also presented and evaluated. Finally, several perspectives on the opportunities and crucial challenges in the future development of metal-CO2 electrochemical systems for practical applications are proposed.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000649969300001

No O-2 evolution was observed with either enzyme on reaction with 10 molar equivalents of H2O2, eliminating catalase-like activity (2H(2)O(2) reversible arrow O-2 + 2H(2)O), but 02 evolution was observed when 100 molar equivalents of H2O2 were added to the enzymes. Protein dimers were observed by SDS-PAGE following H2O2 turnover by the peroxidases, and dimeric forms of CCP(MI) and CCP(W191) were isolated by gel-permeation chromatography. LC-ESI-MS analysis of the tryptic digests of the dimers revealed the previously reported T-6-T-6 crosslink and a new crosslink between T-6-T-26, but no T-26-T-26 crosslink. The crosslinked tryptic peptides contain the exposed tyrosine residues Tyr36, Tyr39 and Tyr42 (T-6), and Tyr229 and Tyr236 (T-26). Addition of a spin trap, 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane (MNP), to the CCP(MI)/H2O2 reaction resulted in MNP labeling of peptides T-6, T-21 (which contains Tyr153) and T-26. MNP labeling of Tyr236 was found by sequencing peptide T-26. MNP labeling did not compete with dimerization of H2O2-oxidized CCP(W191F), suggesting that dityrosine formation in this mutant is very rapid owing to the high reactivity of radicals formed on T-6. H2O2-dependent formation of CCP-cytochrome c heterodimers was observed for both CCP(MI) and W191F in the presence of ferricytochrome c, the oxidized form of CCP's donor substrate. Interestingly, no H2O2-dependent cytochrome crosslinking to the W51F mutant was observed, even though this mutant underwent extensive homocrosslinking. The translocation of oxidizing equivalents from the heme to the surface residues of CCP is discussed in terms of an antioxidant role for CCP.									18	0	0	0	15	0	18			0949-8257			WOS:000181365200002	12589560

The results showed that the large-size inclusions in the RH refining process are Al2O3 inclusions and incompletely modified Ca0.2Al2O3 inclusions, while those in tundish are Al2O3, CaO-Al2O3, CaO-SiO2-Al2O3 and CaO-SiO2-Al2O3-MgO. The typical types of large-size inclusion in slab and hot rolling plates are A1203, CaO-Al2O3, SiO2-Al2O3, CaO-SiO2-Al2O3, CaO-SiO2-Al2O3-MgO and CaO-SiO2-Al2O3-Tio(2). Secondary oxidation was found to occur in molten steel during the pouring process and protective casting should be improved. Large-size inclusions in hot rolling plates are Al2O3 with a mass fraction of 19.8% and incompletely modified CaO.2Al(2)O(3) inclusions with a mass fraction of 45.9% those have not been completely modified, which have high hardness and are difficult to deform. Therefore, it is recommended that calcium treatment should be carried out at the end of RH refining to reduce the Al2O3 and Ca0.2Al(2)O(3) contents. And the effect of calcium addition on the inclusion evolution has been studied by a thermodynamic analysis at 1 873 K. With the increase of calcium addition in molten steel, the evolution route of equilibrium precipitations is Al2O3 -> Ca0.6Al(2)O(3)-> Ca0-2Al(2)O(3).-> CaO.Al2O3 -> 3CaO.Al2O3 -> 12Ca0.7Al(2)O(3)-> CaO. The critical calcium content for CaS and CaO formation increases with increasing oxygen content. To avoid the precipitation reaction between (Ca] and [S], the mass fraction of calcium addition needs to be controlled below 0.0040%.									2	1	0	0	0	0	3			0915-1559	1347-5460		WOS:000680579000007

The individual metal atoms of SACs can be stabilized on supports through various unsaturated chemical sites or space confinement for achieving the maximized atom utilization efficiency. Aside from the development of strategies for preparing high loading and high purity SACs, another key challenge in this field is precisely manipulating the geometric and electronic structure of catalytically active single metal sites, thus rendering the catalysts exceptionally reactive, selective, and stabile compared to their bulk counterparts. This review summarizes recent advancements in SACs for heterogeneous catalysis from the perspective of local structural regulation and the synergistic coupling effect between metal species and supports. Special emphasis is placed on the elucidation of the catalytic structure-performance relationship in terms of coordination environment, valence state and metal-support interactions by advanced characterization and theoretical studies. Select in situ or operando characterization techniques for tracking the SACs' structure evolution under realistic conditions are highlighted. Finally, the challenges and opportunities are discussed to offer insight into the rational design of more intriguing SACs with high activity and distinct chemoselectivity.									85	9	0	0	8	0	86			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000548246600001

Thermodynamics of mixing and ordering								ACTA MATERIALIA				202				55	67		10.1016/j.actamat.2020.10.046				JAN 1 2021	2021	Thermodynamic mixing properties of A(x)B(1-x)O(2-0.5x)V(0.5x), fluorite-type solid solutions (B = Zr, A = {Nd-Yb, Y}, V = oxygen vacancy) are modelled as functions of four parameters, Delta H-1, Delta H-2, Delta H-3 and Delta H-4, which correspond to the enthalpy effects of the reactions (6)A + B-8 = (7)A + B-7 (1), (6)A + B-8 = (8)A + B-6 (2), B-6 + B-8 = B-7 + B-7 (3) and (6)A + (8)A = (7)A + (7)A (4), involving six cation species, (6)A, (7)A, (8)A, B-6, B-7 and B-8. The model predicts that the disordered configuration containing all cation species evolves with the decreasing temperature such that 6-fold coordinated cations tend to vanish within 0 <= x <= 1/2 domain, while 8-fold coordinated cations become extinct within 1/2 <= x <= 1 domain. The further evolution within the intervals of 0 <= x <= 1/3, 1/3 <= x <= 1/2, 1/2 <= x <= 2/3 and 2/3 <= x <= 1 favours the extinction of (7)A, B-8, B-7 and (6)A cation species, respectively. With the further decrease in the temperature 6-fold B and 8-fold A cations reappear within the domains of 1/3 <= x <= 1/2 and 1/2 <= x <= 2/3 via the reaction (7)A + B-7 = (8)A + B-6.

However, accurately predicting the activation energies for diffusion in substitutional alloys remains challenging due to the wide variety of local environments that may exist around the diffusing atom. We address this challenge using a cluster expansion model that explicitly includes a sublattice of sites representing transition states and assess its accuracy in comparison with other models, such as the broken bond model and a model related to Marcus theory, by modeling vacancy-mediated diffusion in Pt-Ni nanoparticles. We find that the prediction error of the cluster expansion is similar to that of other models for small training sets, but with larger training sets the cluster expansion has a significantly lower prediction error than the other models with comparable execution speed. Of the simpler models, the model related to Marcus theory yields predictions of nanoparticle evolution that are most similar to those of the cluster expansion, and a weighted average of the two approaches has the lowest prediction error for activation energies across all training set sizes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2475-9953			WOS:000612146900001

Room temperature mechanical activation of a mixture of oxide precursors with subsequent thermal treatments at 700-900 degrees C results in the formation of Sr(0.9)Ka(0.1)FeO(3-delta) with tetragonal perovskite-like structure. Such allows to decrease the synthesis temperature, if compared to the conventional solid-state route, and to prevent possible volatilization of potassium. The results of Mossbauer spectroscopy studies indicate that the oxygen nonstoichiometry in the samples annealed in air at 900-1100 degrees C with subsequent rapid cooling vary in the range delta=0.30-0.32. The electrical conductivity in air exhibits a metal-like behaviour at temperatures above 400 degrees C and semiconductor behaviour in the low-temperature range, reaching 13-30 S/cm under prospective operation conditions for alkaline electrolyzers (<= 90 degrees C).

Two different gas precursor mixtures [hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO)/oxygen and HMDSO/heptadecafluoro-1-decene (HDFD)/Ar] were used for microwave plasma polymer deposition.The barrier properties of the specimens were evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The evolution of the structure of the plasma polymer-treated coil coating during immersion tests was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was used to study the change of the top layer composition with the immersion time. Composition of the coil coating surface after plasma activation procedures was analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to reveal the structure and thickness of the plasma polymer layers.The results show that the plasma treatment procedure causes a deterioration of the barrier properties of the polyurethane coil coating due to the formation of pores in the coil coating. However, the fluorine-containing plasma polymer films (obtained using the HMDSO/HDFD/Ar gas mixture) show enhanced stability and better barrier properties when compared to fluorine-free films (obtained using the HMDSO/oxygen gas mixture). The activation of the coil coatings by oxygen plasma treatment can be responsible for degradation of the barrier properties. The argon plasma activation is less destructive in comparison to the oxygen plasma treatment.The plasma polymer treatment of the coil coating using the fluorine-containing precursor gas mixture can be used for modification of the coil coating surface almost without any degradation of the barrier properties.

J	Alboni, Paolo; Alboni, Marco								Vasovagal Syncope As A Manifestation Of An Evolutionary Selected Trait.								Journal of atrial fibrillation				7	2			1035	1035		10.4022/jafib.1035				2014 Aug-Sep	2014	Some observations suggest that typical (emotional or orthostatic) vasovagal syncope (VVS) is not a disease, but rather a manifestation of a non-pathological trait. We conducted an extensive bibliographic research on the vasovagal reactions in animals, including humans, in order to investigate the possible factors that may explain the origin and evolution of VVS. We found two processes which appear relevant for the investigation of VVS evolution: fear/threat bradycardia (alarm bradycardia) in animals, mainly during tonic immobility and vasovagal reflex during hemorrhagic shock (thoracic hypovolemia) both in animals and humans. The available data suggest that VVS in humans, alarm bradycardia in animals and the vasovagal reflex during hemorrhagic shock share the same physiological mechanisms and that is indicative of a common evolutionary root. However, during the vasovagal reflex loss of consciousness occurs in humans, but it is absent (or extremely rare) in animals. That can be explained as a by-product due to the erect position and the large brain evolved in our species. If the vasovagal reflex persisted for millions of years along the vertebrates evolutionary history, we can reasonably assume that it has a function and it is not harmful. It could be neutral or beneficial, but the available data suggest it is beneficial; likely, it evolved as an advantageous response to stressful and possibly dangerous heart conditions. Emotional or orthostatic vasovagal reflex is preceded by enhanced sympathetic activity, which is harmful and possibly dangerous. The transient inhibition of the sympathetic system, together with activation of the vagal tone , characterizes VVS. The consequent slowing of the heart rate induced by the vasovagal reflex may constitute a beneficial break of the cardiac pump, thereby reducing myocardial oxygen consumption. We suggest that typical VVS should be regarded as a selected response, which probably evolved in the ancient past as a defense mechanism of the organism within some ancestral group(s) of vertebrates.									5	1	0	0	3	0	5			1941-6911			MEDLINE:27957092	27957092

Use of mixed phase FeO(OH) and/or incorporation of Co-II/Ni-II metal into the FeO(OH) structure has also been demonstrated as a convenient approach to achieve high OER activity. Nevertheless, preparation of phase-pure, albeit active FeO(OH) material with fair electrochemical performance remains a perdurable challenge. Moreover, the role of the crystalline phase and its surface structure in controlling the OER activity is still unclear. Herein, a simple synthetic protocol has been developed to prepare a series of phase-pure alpha-FeO(OH) (goethite) and gamma-FeO(OH) (lepidocrocite) materials. By changing the reaction conditions such as iron salt and reaction temperature, the crystallinity as well as the phase of the oxy-hydroxide material have been varied. The isolated alpha- and gamma-FeO(OH) materials with different crystallinity were thereafter deposited on nickel foam (NF) for alkaline OER study. The recorded overpotential value at 10 mA cm(-2) has been found to be dependent on the phase and crystallinity of the FeO(OH) materials. The partially crystalline gamma-FeO(OH) isolated at room temperature (gamma-FeO(OH)@RT) turns out to be the most active with a lowest overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a long term stability of 12 h. The gamma-FeO(OH)@RT/NF anode can furnish high current densities like 50-100 mA cm(-2) which makes this anode distinct from the previously reported FeO(OH) materials. Detailed electrochemical study suggested that the fair activity of the gamma-FeO(OH)@RT arises due to a facile electrokinetics as evident from the small Tafel slope and charge transfer resistance (R-ct value from the Nyquist plot). Owing to the superior activity of the gamma-FeO(OH)@RT/NF, the anode can further be incorporated into an overall water splitting electrolyzer that can operate at a cell potential of 1.68 V. The microscopic characterization provides concrete evidence in support of the polycrystallinity of the gamma-FeO(OH)@RT. The superior activity of the gamma-FeO(OH)@RT perhaps can be correlated to its polycrystalline nature with more defect edges, the presence of a large exposed surface and random atomic arrangements. The highest degree of multiple surface active terminals (-O, -OH and -Fe) available in this polycrystalline gamma-FeO(OH) perhaps makes the catalyst more active compared to the crystalline FeO(OH) analogue with a limited number of surface terminals. From a comparative study with a series of FeO(OH) materials, this work highlights a direct relationship between the surface functionality and the electrochemical activity of the FeO(OH) material.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000855380700001	36125011

Herein, the authors record the complete evolution process of Co SAC during the pyrolysis a Co/Zn-containing zeolitic imidazolate framework. Aberration-corrected environmental TEM coupled with in-situ EELS is used for direct visualization of the evolution process at 200-1000 degrees C. Dissolution of carbon into the nanoparticles of Co is found to be key to modulating the wetting behavior of nanoparticles on the carbon support; melting of Co nanoparticles and their motion within the zeolitic architecture leads to the etching of the framework structure, yielding porous C/N support onto which Co-single atoms reside. This uniquely structured Co SAC is found to be effective for the oxidation of a series of aromatic alkanes to produce selective ketones among other possible products. The carbon dissolution and melting/sublimation-driven structural dynamics of transition metal revealed here will expand the methodology in synthesizing SACs and other high-temperature processes.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2198-3844		WOS:000790506500001	35508897

Self-organized multilayer structure in magnetron sputtered Si-Pt reservoirs on ?-TiAl alloy induced by high-temperature annealing and oxidation								SURFACE & COATINGS TECHNOLOGY				447						128865	10.1016/j.surfcoat.2022.128865				OCT 15 2022	2022	The development of oxidation-resistant coatings has been stimulated by the needs of the aerospace industry, in particular following the introduction of the y-TiAl alloys in turbofan engines; however, oxidation resistance at high temperatures (>750 degrees C) is still a significant challenge. In the present work, the influence of Si-Pt-based coatings on a Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb alloy is evaluated when exposed to isothermal oxidation in a high-temperature environment (900 degrees C). The coatings were deposited by magnetron sputtering using different Si (63-80 at.%) and Pt (20-37 at.%) concentrations as well as varied thicknesses (6.8-12.2 mu m). The evolution of the microstructure of the as-deposited Si-Pt layers has been tuned by vacuum annealing (10-6 Torr) at 750 degrees C for 16 h, followed by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) analyses. After vacuum annealing, the formation of a multilayer microstructure composed of intermetallic (PtxSiy, PtxAly, and TixSiy) sublayers has been identified. Influenced by the different Si-Pt reservoirs (thickness and the compositional Si/Pt ratio), the sublayers exhibited different morphologies; for the samples with a high Pt concentration, the growth of a columnar microstructure was observed. After oxidation at 900 degrees C for 100 h, the analyses indicated microstructural evolution, mostly related to the continued solid-state diffusional transport of the main elements (Ti, Al, Pt, Si, and O) and solid-state boundary reactions. The presence of oxygen was confirmed in all oxidized samples, but it was restricted to the top zone of the multilayer system primarily associated with the growth of mixed SiO2 and Al2O3 compounds.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0257-8972	1879-3347		WOS:000862165900002

Herein, based on the short distance enhancement effects, a novel PtCo@NC catalyst with remarkably enhanced electrocatalytic properties for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in acidic electrolytes is developed by shortening the Pt-Co active site distance. In brief, a series of PtCo@NC catalysts with different Pt-Co biatomic arrangement are precisely synthesized by an in situ reduction-fusion method, achieving Pt-Co structural evolution from a Pt/Co individual monometallic islet (A-700 degrees C) to PtCo heterodimer (A-800 degrees C) and then a PtCo alloy (A-900 degrees C) embedded on nitrogen-doped carbon matrixes. Compared with the Pt/Co monometallic islet and heterodimer, the PtCo@NC (A-900 degrees C) with the shortest Pt-Co active site distance exhibits the highest mass activity of 2.30 A mg(Pt)(-1), which is 12.23 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C and exceeds almost all the reported MOR catalysts in acidic electrolytes. Both experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the remarkably improved activity stems from the modification of electron distribution around Pt/Co metal centers, thus promoting the rate-determining methanol dehydrogenation step and CO oxidative removal processes, which are dependent on the distance between bimetallic active sites.									31	2	0	0	0	0	31			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000535704800001

This study targeted the carbonate karst reservoirs of the Ordovician Ma5 Member in the southeastern Ordos Basin. Based on the analysis of cores, thin sections, cathodoluminescence, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), carbon and oxygen isotopes and trace elements, we discuss the development characteristics, types and influencing factors of paleokarst reservoirs. Petrology and geochemistry show three kinds of karstification in the study area: quasicontemporaneous karst, epigenetic karst and deep burial karst. The quasi-contemporaneous and epigenetic paleokarsts were mainly controlled by freshwater, where the soluble components of the strata were preferentially dissolved. The deep burial karstification was dominated by the reaction product H2S from thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) between sulfate minerals and organic matter, during which hydrothermal fluid provided the required activation energy for the reaction. The observations of cores and thin sections show that the paleokarst reservoirs are composed of different kinds of dissolution pores and fractures and cemented by multistage calcite and siliceous cements. Influenced by freshwater leaching and hydrothermal fluid, the three paleokarst processes led to negative anomalies in delta O-18 and delta C-13, while the low delta Ce, low delta Eu and rare earth element (REE) partition modes confirm that the intensity of freshwater leaching was stronger than that of hydrothermal fluid. The controlling factors of the paleokarst reservoirs included acidic fluids, paleogeomorphology and paleostructure in each diagenetic stage. According to the structural background and core characteristics, we establish a development model and spatial evolution model of the paleokarst reservoirs in the southeastern Ordos Basin.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0920-4105	1873-4715		WOS:000604777600038

It has been demonstrated that Fe-aq(3+) and Ce-aq(4+) species are efficient electron accepters during the photoproduction of O-2 over a variety of oxides, even at very low concentrations. The O-2 yield was found to depend on the type and surface activity of the cation used as an electron acceptor, and the salt counter anion, While Ce-aq(4+) gives slightly higher initial O-2 rates, Fe-aq(3+) tends to give higher long-term O-2 yields. The O-2 yield was found to be mainly sensitive to the intrinsic properties of a given material, such as the type of the oxide used and its physicochemical characteristics, e.g. crystal structure and level of crystallinity. For the powders tested, O-2 production was independent of the BET surface area and the activity does not correlate directly with the onset of light absorption of the powders. With a light having lambda greater than or equal to 330 nm, O-2 production activity decreased in the order TiO2-rutile>TiO2-anatase>WO3>CeO(2)much greater than amorphous TiO2, whereas with a light having lambda greater than or equal to 420 nm, it decreased in the order WO3>TiO2>CeO2. Small amounts of Sn on TiO2-rutile markedly improved its activity. In addition, the O-2 yield strongly depended on the concentration of the electron acceptor and the pH of the suspension. During the reaction, small amounts of hydrogen were also produced. The reaction pathways for electron scavenging by Ce-aq(4+) and Fe-aq(3+), and the process leading to O-2 evolution will be discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	MARTIN, HD								THE FUNCTION OF NATURAL COLORANTS - THE BIOCHROMES								CHIMIA				49	3			45	68						MAR 1995	1995	The colors of nature belong undoubtedly to the beautiful part of our environment. Colors always fascinated humans and left them wonderstruck. But the trivial question as to the practical application of natural colorants led soon and consequently to coloring and dyeing of objects and humans. Aesthetical, ritual and similar aspects prevailed. This function of dyes and pigments is widespread in nature. The importance of such visual-effective dyes is obvious: they support communication between organisms with the aid of conspicuous optical signals and they conceal revealing ones, when inconspicuosness can mean survival. But the purpose of natural pigments and biochromes is broader. Emergence and development of life on earth is inseparably associated with the radiating energy source, the sun. This led to the evolution of biochromes with various functions: collection and harvesting of light, transduction into chemical energy, transport of electrons or gases, photoreceptor processing of information and color discrimination, to mention only a few. Without these pigments - with their photobiological, biochemical, and physiological reactions - life, as we know it, would not have been possible. Color is essential. Several times during the evolution protecting devices and mechanisms had to be invented against the destructive and damaging influence of reactive oxygen, light and UV radiation. To this end nature employed accessory pigments as carotenoids and flavonoids. It is notable and interesting to recognize that human epidemiology and animal studies have indicated that cancer risk may be modified by changes in dietary habits or dietary components. Recent studies indicate that phytochemicals, among them the carotenoids and flavonoids, can inhibit tumor genesis at one or several stages.									10	0	0	0	3	0	11			0009-4293			WOS:A1995QR77200002

Layered compounds have demonstrated a wide range of physicochemical properties that support their potential practical applications. Because dimensionality plays a crucial role in determining fundamental properties of lamellar structure, when they go under exfoliation down to few-layer or monolayer nanosheets, their characteristics will differ from those of their stacked bulks. The photocatalytic properties of these few-layer or mono-layer materials can be improved through in-plane and interplane structural modification by doping with metal or non-metal elements. Among the various layered materials, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has emerged as one of the most promising photocatalysts due to its metalfree nature, abundance in raw material, thermal and physicochemical stability and suitable bandgap. Although its bulk structure shows a weak photocatalytic activity, its thermally or chemically exfoliated nanosheets demonstrate greatly improved activity. Further, the electronic structure of the nanostructures can be modified by elemental doping with triazine units to activate the pi-conjugated system in the photocatalytic reaction. In this review paper, we analyze the latest developments, particularly in the area of phosphorous-doped graphitic carbon nitride (P-doped g-C3N4) photocatalysts and their molecular and structural modifications for improving H-2 generation and CO2 conversion to solar fuels.									30	3	0	0	1	0	31			1364-0321	1879-0690		WOS:000548788600013

Herein, a hybrid nanostructure of RuO2 strongly coupled with structurally controllable NiMoO wafer arrays was elaborately fabricated via highly matched lattices for superior alkaline water electrolysis through optimizing the adsorption energies of the key intermediates at the interface based on synergistic electronic, geometric, and interfacial effects. The incorporation of Mo ion can adjust the electronic structure of host NiOx endowing the resultant NiMoO with suitable H and O intermediate binding energy for active species transfer between the interfaces. The ratio of O/C on the surface of flexible carbon cloth was well tuned through O2-plasma to achieve the desired geometric structure of NiMoO wafers with features of rich porosity and abundant active site. The RuO2 nanoparticles are homogeneously distributed on the surface of porous NiMoO wafers via highly matched lattices, thereby offering efficient interfacial synergy. Consequently, the hybrid nanostructure of Ru species and NiMoO exhibits greatly enhanced bifunctional electrocatalytic activities toward both HER and OER for overall water splitting. The integrated NiMoO wafer works like a turbo for engineering robust Ru-based bifunctional electrocatalyst. The finding may provide insights for the rational design of advanced nanocomposite catalysts for various energy conversion applications.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000664736100003

For this purpose, cathodic current-potential curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques were used. Furthermore, the change of hydrogen evolution activity of the electrodes as a function of operation time in alkaline solution was also investigated. Surface morphologies showed that the composite coatings prepared to have compact and porous surface. EDX analysis confirmed the presence of Ag, Pd and Pt metals over the NiCoZn layer. The co-deposition of nickel, cobalt and zinc on copper surface and subsequently alkaline leaching of zinc rendered cathode material very active in hydrogen evolution. The modification of alkaline leached NiCoZn ternary coating by deposition of small amounts of Ag, Pd and Pt can further enhance the hydrogen evolution performance of this Raney-type electrode when compared to NiCoZn individually. The order of hydrogen evolution activity of catalysts studied is Ni < NiCoZn < NiCoZn Pd < NiCoZn Ag < NiCoZn Pt. The long-term electrolysis tests showed that the Pt-modified electrode has the better time stability than the others. The superiority of Pt-modified catalyst explained by well known intrinsic catalytic activity of Pt. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To realize the large-scale hydrogen production, it is paramount to develop desirable electrocatalysts with engineered structure, high catalytic activity, facile accessibility, low cost, and good durability. Of late, boride-based materials, especially transition-metal borides (TMBs), are emerging as promising candidates for the EWS process. However, so far, little attempt has been made to provide a comprehensive summary on these findings. Herein, this review provides the up-to-date status on upgrading the catalytic performance of TMB-based nanomaterials by regulating the internal and external characteristics. The conventional synthetic techniques are first presented for the preparation of TMB-based catalysts. Afterwards, the advanced strategies are summarized to enhance the catalytic performance of TMBs, including morphology control, component regulation, phase engineering, surface oxidation and hybridization. Then, the design principles of TMB-based electrocatalysts for high-performance EWS are outlined. Lastly, the current challenges and future directions in the development of TMB-based materials are proposed. This review article is expected to envisage insights into the TMBs-based water splitting and to provide strategies for design of the next-generation TMB-based electrocatalysts.									80	6	0	0	4	0	80			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000505357500005

Two-dimensional, reactive Euler equations with a detailed hydrogen/oxygen reaction model were adopted in the computations to simulate the detonation dynamics in the annular geometry. Considering both the decoupling of the detonation wave front and the development of the Mach-stem in reflection, the propagation is divided into unstable and stable propagation modes with different Mach-stem evolutions, namely, a growing, steady, or decaying type. The numerical observations indicate that in the unstable propagation mode, velocity loss and oscillation occur near the inner wall, while the wave front shape and velocity evolution are steadier for the stable propagation mode. The overdriven degree near the outer wall increases as the Mach-stem strength attenuates. The propagation mode diagrams demonstrate that an increase in the initial pressure and wall curvature radius can extend the range of the stable propagation mode, and the Mach-stem is transformed from a growing to steady, and finally a decaying type with the increase in the initial pressure or the decrease in the wall curvature radius to channel width ratio. The limit of wall curvature radius separating the unstable and stable modes is independent of the channel width for the Mach-stem steady and decaying types, while they are positively correlated for the Mach-stem growing type. Finally, a qualitative procedure is proposed to help distinguish different propagation modes based on the formation mechanism of each propagation dynamics.

One of the serious problems occurred in gas turbine is TBC delamination which is caused by startup, steady and stop operation in service. TBC delamination results from subjecting to both cyclic thermal stress and evolution of internal stress due to thermally grown oxide (TGO). In this study, the finite element code which can simulate thermal and internal stress fields generated in TBC was developed. The developed code involves the follows: inelastic constitutive equation for ceramic coating, bilinear-type constitutive equation for bond coating and Chaboche-type inelastic constitutive equation for the substrate, and mass transfer equation in consideration of oxygen diffusion and chemical reaction with aluminum. Thermal cycling simulation was conducted using the developed code. It was confirmed that maximum stress and its location in the ceramic coating/bond coating interface were matched with the associated experimental results.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1013-9826			INSPEC:20528144

The structural and morphological properties of the films were investigated using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The X-ray diffraction analysis shows that the films of MoO3 and WO3 were well crystallized in orthorhombic and monoclinic phase respectively with the crystallites preferentially oriented toward (2 0 0) direction parallel a-axis for both samples. In literature, we have shown in previous papers that structural and surface morphology of metal thin films play an important role in the gas detection mechanism. In this article, we have studied the response evolution of MoO3 and WO3 thin films sensors ethanol versus time, working temperature and the concentration of the ethanol. It was found that these films had high sensitivity to ethanol, which made them as a good candidate for the ethanol sensor. Finally, the photocatalytic activity of the samples was evaluated with respect to the degradation reaction of a wastewater containing methylene blue (MB) under UV-visible light irradiation. The molybdenum trioxide exhibits a higher degradation rate than the tungsten trioxide thin films under similar experimental conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Under visible-light irradiation, BiOBr/Bi4(4)O5Br(2)/PDI could degrade 90% Bisphenol A (BPA) within 75 min, while degrade 100% 17 alpha-ethynyl estradiol (EE2) and 17 beta- estradiol (E2) within 15 min. Radicals quenching experiment and EPR indicated both & BULL;O(2)(- )and holes were the main substances for EDCs degradation, and the possible degradation pathway of EDCs are proposed based on the LC-MS analysis results. In the composite of BiOBr/Bi(4)O5Br(2)/PDI, the matching energy band structure between Bi(4)O5Br(2) and BiOBr facilitated the formation of heterojunction for strengthening the space charge separation. Meanwhile, PDI with strong photosensitivity combined with BiOBr/Bi(4)O5Br(2 & nbsp;)not only enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity but also broadened the light-harvesting range. Owning to the unique one-dimensional conjugated structure and internal electric field effect, PDI could also promote the photo-carriers transfer and separation. With the bi-heterojunction effect, photo-generated electrons were transferred to BiOBr conduction band while holes were accumulated on PDI valence band. Simultaneously, holes could oxidize water with the production of oxygen following being reduced to & BULL;O-2(-) by photo-generated electrons. Even under oxygen-poor conditions, the production of & BULL;O-2(-) can reach 32.7 x 10(-5)mol & BULL;g(-1)& BULL;h(-1), resulting in more than 85% BPA degradation within 75 min.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000777612900001

Hierarchical decoration of nano-size TiO2 on Bi2S3 (Bi2S3@TiO2) having starfish morphology with a varied amount of TiO2 are synthesized by one-pot hydrothermal method both semiconducting and catalytic properties of pristine and Bi2S3@TiO2 hierar-chical nanostructures are thoroughly characterized and discussed by using structural, optical, morpho-logical, electronic, surface and bulk elemental composition analysis. Heterojunction formed between Bi2S3 and TiO2 promotes suppression of photo charge carrier recombination and facilitated fast trans-portation of charge carriers in turn promoted oxidation and reduction reactions at catalytic active sites. The optimized photocatalyst Bi2S3@TiO2 displayed a large surface area of 38.6 m2 g-1 and plenty of catalytic active sites facilitated a high turn-over frequency of 0.085 cm-1. Further, the optimal experi-mental conditions, a high rate of H2 evolution of 44.1 mmol h-1 g-1cat under UV-visible light to the hydrogen conversion efficiency was calculated as 21.7%. Consequently, the electrochemical measure-ments of the Bi2S3@TiO2 a significantly HER overpotential of 222/332 mV to achieve a current density of 20/50 mA cm-2. As a result, enhanced efficiency of Bi2S3@TiO2/NF is demonstrated for H2 evolution in an alkaline medium. The overall water splitting performance is attributed to available plenty of catalytic active sites. Thus, the prepared composite showed enhanced stability for prolonged usage for 50 h of light irradiation. These results will open up opportunities to develop low-cost and earth-abundant efficient electrode materials for multi-functional applications.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a novel Ru-doped hierarchical flower-like Ni2P/NiO heterostructure nanosheets vertically aligned on Ni foam substrates (Ru-Ni2P/NiO/NF HNSs) electmcatalyst is synthesized by a top-down strategy to achieve a top-level performance of HER in alkaline media. Benefitting from electronic reconfiguration, hierarchical flower-like nanosheet structure, and abundant heterogeneous interfaces, the as-obtained Ru-Ni2P/NiO/NF HNSs require an ultralow onset overpotential of 0 mV, a minimum overpotential of 12 mV and 112 mV to afford 10 mA Cm-2 and 1000 mA Cm-2, respectively, and a Tafel slope of 22.6 mV decade(-1). Further X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis combined with density functional theory calculations reveal the charge density redistribution, where electron accumulation on Ru favors the optimization of H2O absorption energies and the reduced energy barrier of the Volmer step, whereas the coupling effect of Ni2P/NiO heterogeneous interfaces is responsible for accelerating the Tafel step activity, synergistically resulting in accelerating alkaline HER kinetics. These findings reveal the significance of the rational combination of noble metal doping and heterostructure engineering toward the rational design and preparing of highly efficient electrocatalysts for the HER and beyond.									14	2	0	0	0	0	15			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000653229500104

Normally, structure design of polymer photocatalyst is focus on tuning its optical band structure or charge-separation ability, the importance of electron-output ability in photocatalytic process is always ignored. This study demonstrates a molecular engineering strategy by introducing an electron-output ldquotentaclerdquo site, i.e. dibenzothiophene-S,S-dioxide (FSO) unit, into the polymer backbone to construct a series of donor-acceptor type conjugated polymer photocatalysts for efficient hydrogen evolution, which not only results in optimized light absorption ability and excellent exciton-separation, but also leads to the efficient electron-output ability. Detailed DFT calculations further theoretically confirm the vital role of FSO unit as an electron-output ldquotentaclerdquo site.

A highly crystalline MFI zeolite structure was formed under pH = 11 in 2 days, without the need for additional alkali metal cations. Direct evidence of the incorporation of Mn in the zeolite framework sites was observed by performing structure parameter refinements, supported by data collected from other characterization techniques such as IR. Raman, UV-vis, TGA, N-2-adsorption, SEM, TEM, EDAX, and XPS. UV-vis spectra from the unique optical properties of Mn-ZSM-5 show two absorption peaks at 250 and 500 nm. The absorption varies in different atmospheres accompanied by a color change of the materials due to oxygen evolution. Raman spectra show a significant and gradual red shift from 383 cm(-1) to 372 cm(-1) when the doping amount of Mn is increased from 0 to 2 wt %. This suggests a weakened zeolite structural unit induced by the Mn substitution. The catalytic activity was studied in both gas-phase benzyl alcohol oxidation and toluene oxidation reactions with remarkable oxidative activity presented for the first time. These reactions result in a 55% yield of benzaldehyde, and 65% total conversion of toluene to carbon dioxide for the 2% Mn-ZSM-5. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) using CO in He demonstrates two reduction peaks: one between 300 and 500 degrees C and the other between 500 and 800 degrees C. The first reduction peak, due to manganese-activated oxidation sites shifted from higher temperature to lower temperature, and the peak intensity of CO2 rises when the dopant amount increases. For the first time, calculated photophysical properties of a model Mn(O-SiH3)(4)(-) compound, an Mn-embedded zeolite cluster, and model Mn oxides help to explain and interpret the diffuse reflectance spectroscopy of Mn-ZSM-5 zeolites.									135	11	1	0	19	1	142			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000320483900030	23679582

Here, through a carboxyl group assisted coordination route, MXene decorated with carboxyl groups provides chelation sites enabling coordination with UiO-66-NH2(Zr/Ti) (UZT) to fabricate a tightly connected UiO-66-NH2(Zr/Ti)/carboxyl-functionalized MXene (UZT/CFMX) heterostructure. This is the first instance of direct chemical bonding of MOFs-involved heterostructure via a coordination bond. The critical role of decorated carboxyl groups can be determined so that 1) these can help to establish a strong coordination bond between two materials; 2) act as bridge to promote the electrons transfer from MOFs to MXene, thus relieving carrier recombination, and 3) most interestingly, the carbon atom on the carboxyl group forms a bond with the oxygen from water stimulating the water to dissociate into OH* and H*, thus adding additional reaction pathways for promoting photocatalytic water splitting. Accordingly, the resulting UZT/CFMX shows efficient solar-driven photocatalytic performance for water splitting. The H-2 evolution rate is as high as 2187 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), 20 times higher than that of UZT and 4 times higher than that of UiO-66-NH2 (Zr/Ti)/MXene (UZT/MX), also surpassing the majority of reported MOF-based photocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000790135600001

Degradation of Rh/C was monitored by the changes in Rh electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen reduction (ORR). Rh/C catalyst was particularly stable during ADP1 showing only a minor loss of ECSA, while its electrocatalytic activity for HER and ORR was practically unaffected, which was further corroborated with identical location SEM (IL-SEM) imaging. In the case of ADP2, severe degradation of Rh/C occurred followed by substantial decay in its electrocatalytic activity. Coupling of the electrochemical flow cell (EFC) with ICP-MS revealed much higher Rh dissolution in ADP2 than in ADP1. IL-SEM in combination with ex-situ TEM imaging showed that degradation of the Rh/C sample is not homogeneous during ADP2, as dissolution prevails on certain locations, while dissolution followed by re-deposition occurs on others. According to the results obtained in this work, Rh/C catalysts are exceptionally sensitive to the sudden potential jumps between particularly low and high values. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The development of highly efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts is crucial for mass hydrogen production from water splitting. We newly assemble the self-standing 3D NiFe-LDH@CoSx/NF bifunctional electrocatalysts, via the electrodeposition of amorphous CoSx on two-dimensional (2D) NiFe-LDH nanosheets which are supported by porous nickel foam (NF). The integration of HER-active electrocatalyst of CoSx with outstanding OER catalyst of NiFe-LDH guarantees the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the formation of the constructed interfaces between amorphous CoSx and NiFe-LDH nanosheets synergistically favors the electron transfer. Therefore, this novel NiFe-LDH@CoSx/NF hierarchical assembly needs ultralow overpotentials of 136 mV (for HER) and 206 mV (for OER) to afford the 10 mA cm(-2) current density in alkaline medium (1 M KOH). An electrolyzer based on the NiFe-LDH@CoSx/NF produces an extremely low cell voltage (1.537 V) and good durability. This study offers a promising strategy for facile fabrication of low-cost electrocatalysts which boost the electrocatalytic performance for overall water splitting.									36	0	0	0	2	0	35			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000663667400005

However, developing highly efficient photoanodes for PEC cells to meet industrial requirements remains a challenge. Herein, we effectively alter the onset potential of a photoanode though the doping of V into Co oxide film via the low-cost method of magnetron co-sputtering deposition on a p(+)n junction Si cell (p(+)nSi/CoVO). The highest photocurrent density of p+nSi/CoVO is 29.15 mA cm(-2) (at 1.23 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)). Moreover, a successful decrease in the onset potential by 40 mV to 1.00 V (at 1 mA cm(-2)) and a 3.6-fold increase in the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) are achieved compared to p(+)nSi/CoO. The p(+)n junction Si cell provides not only photoexcited vacancies but also a photoproduced voltage of 608 mV. We find that the doped V atoms are multifunctional: they can decrease the charge transfer resistance of the Co3O4 film, serve as a Lewis acid to increase the local pH value, and facilitate the generation of oxo-bridged Co-IV=O species to accelerate the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER); therefore, they can obviously decrease the onset potential of p(+)nSi/CoVO in the OER. This work highlights a general approach to further improve the performance of OER catalysts via engineering active sites and the local chemical environment through element doping.									13	1	0	0	1	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000451600200064

This Review examines the challenges of this approach and how they can be addressed through catalyst and electrolyser design.Powered by renewable energy sources such as solar, marine, geothermal and wind, generation of storable hydrogen fuel through water electrolysis provides a promising path towards energy sustainability. However, state-of-the-art electrolysis requires support from associated processes such as desalination of water sources, further purification of desalinated water, and transportation of water, which often contribute financial and energy costs. One strategy to avoid these operations is to develop electrolysers that are capable of operating with impure water feeds directly. Here we review recent developments in electrode materials/catalysts for water electrolysis using low-grade and saline water, a significantly more abundant resource worldwide compared to potable water. We address the associated challenges in design of electrolysers, and discuss future potential approaches that may yield highly active and selective materials for water electrolysis in the presence of common impurities such as metal ions, chloride and bio-organisms.									236	14	0	0	15	0	241			2058-7546			WOS:000514052800005		
J	Zhang, J; Lee, HG								Numerical modeling of nucleation and growth of inclusions in molten steel based on mean processing parameters								ISIJ INTERNATIONAL				44	10			1629	1638		10.2355/isijinternational.44.1629				2004	2004	As an important aspect of inclusion engineering, numerical prediction of inclusion behavior in molten steel has attracted much attention in order to control inclusions in steel. Although considerable efforts have been made in the modeling of inclusion growth, it is still necessary to employ an initial particle size distribution (PSD) gained from experiments or assumptions as an input for numerical models. The present work focuses on the construction of a general nucleation-growth model, which combines thermodynamics, classical homogeneous nucleation theories and dynamics of particle collision and coagulation on the basis of mean processing parameters. This can be employed, without any initial PSD of inclusions in advance, to describe the time evolution of PSD in molten steel during inclusion nucleation, Ostwald ripening, and collision growth processes. With regard to collision-coagulation growth mechanisms of inclusions, four approaches, namely Brownian collision, turbulent collision, Stokes collision and gradient collision in laminar shear layers, have been investigated to estimate their role in the evolution of PSD during steel melt deoxidation process. In addition, an approximate numerical technique, termed the 'DS method', has been developed as a modification of the so-called (1) discrete-sectional representation and (2) Particle-Size-Grouping method in order for an efficient solution for population balance equations (PBE) at lower cost in CPU time. Finally, as an application of this general model, the evolution of nucleation and growth of alumina inclusions is demonstrated in the Fe-Al-O melt system. The predicted molten steel total oxygen and particle size distribution of alumina inclusions are compared with the experiment data cited from references.									54	6	0	0	2	0	58			0915-1559			WOS:000224671400003

Chars were prepared at different temperatures and heating rates from a size-graded low volatile bituminous coal. The reactivity of resultant chars was measured in Kinetic Regime I using a fixed bed reactor. The structure of fresh and partly burnt chars was characterized using quantitative XRD analysis (QXRDA), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), high-resolution FESEM, and multi-point gas adsorption.Both QXRDA and HRTEM observations show that char structure becomes more ordered with increasing pyrolysis temperature and decreasing heating rate. Char structure was also investigated as a function of char burnoff. The QXRDA results show that the amorphous concentration of char decreases during combustion while the aromaticity and average crystallite size of char increase. As a result, char structure becomes more ordered during combustion. This is in agreement with HRTEM observations. Due to the low reaction temperature (about 673 K), which is much lower than that for char preparation (1473 K), it was believed that oxidation, instead of thermal effect, contributed to the structural ordering observed during combustion. The structural parameters obtained from QXRDA were then correlated to char reactivity. Structural ordering was found to be responsible for char deactivation during thermal treatment and oxidation. Since the amorphous concentration and aromaticity of char are two strongest indicators of char reactivity, a structural disorder index, DOI, was defined based on them to describe char structural evolution, and further correlated to char reactivity.

Thus, oxides (i.e., SiO2) are commonly used to obtain high expected capacities and long-term cycle performances. Despite extensive studies of the electrochemical-mechanical behaviors of high-capacity energy storage materials, the mechanical behaviors of amorphous SiO2 during electrochemical reaction remain largely unknown. Here, we systematically investigate the stress evolution, electronic structure, and mechanical deformation of lithiated SiO2 through first-principles computation and the finite element method. The structural and thermodynamic role of O in the amorphous Li-O-Si system is reported and compared with that in Si. Strong Si-O bonds in SiO2 show high mechanical strength and brittle behavior, but as Li is inserted, the Li-rich SiO2 phases become mechanically softened. The relaxation kinetics of SiO2, inducing deviatoric inelastic strains under mechanical constraints, is also compared with that of Si. The finite element model including the kinetic model for anisotropic expansion demonstrates that the long-term cycling stability of core-shell Si-SiO2 nanoparticles mainly arises from the reaction kinetics and high mechanical strength of SiO2. These results provide fundamental insights into the chemomechanical behavior of SiO2 for practical use.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000470034700032	31084026

Hence a fundamental understanding of the microstructure evolution and bond formation mechanism is necessary. In this work we probe the welded interface in aluminum and steel joined using vaporizing foil actuator welding (VFAW) a novel impact welding process. The goal of such a detailed characterization campaign is to understand the bond formation mechanism. The study shows that the interfacial microstructure has a pronounced hierarchical nature. At the macro scale, the interface is characterized by a wavy interface which is a result of extensive plastic deformation that accompanies the process. Detailed transmission electron microscopy shows evidence for the formation of a liquid film at the interface resulting in significant inter diffusion of Fe. The solidified structure at the interface consisted of crystalline alpha-Al and an amorphous metastable Al-Fe intermetallic compound similar to the observations in rapid solidification of Al-Fe alloys. The sub-nm scale characterization of the interface using atom probe tomography showed two distinct zones1. A magnesium (5 at.%) and oxygen (15 at.%) rich (not detectable using energy dispersive spectroscopy) which was probably from the decomposition of the surface oxide film2. The rapidly solidified reaction zone consisting of primary crystalline alpha-Al and an amorphous Al-Fe (15 at.%)-O (0.5 at.%)-Si (1.5 at.%). Based on these observations a mechanism for the bond formation is presented.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1044-5803	1873-4189		WOS:000467668600013

Carbon host materials, e.g., amorphous carbon (AC), porous carbon (PC), and ZIF-derived carbon (ZC), are widely used in Ru/C catalysts. Here, we investigate the influences of the above three different carbon host materials over the supported Ru species in Ru/C catalysts. A stronger metal-support interaction is revealed in the Ru/ZC catalyst, in which the supported Ru species are preserved in a metallic state and a highly dispersed form, resulting in enhanced HER activity and stability in alkaline media. Both the Ru sites and Ru-C interfacial sites are determined to be active for the HER in Ru/ZC according to our electrochemical poisoning experiment. In addition, an acid etching treatment (AET) strategy is proposed to magnify the interfacial effect of Ru/C catalysts for further HER improvement, and the optimal Ru/ZC-E50 catalyst that undergoes appropriate etching treatment shows a smaller Ru size and more exposed Ru-C interface, realizing an overpotential of only 29 mV (at 10 mA cm(-2)) and a Tafel slope of 82 mV dec(-1) that greatly outperform those of Ru-based and Pt-based materials for the HER in alkaline media. These specific findings can provide deeper insights into the design strategy, structure-property relationship, and future development of Ru/C catalysts for efficient HER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000840927500001		
J	Angulo, Andrea E.; Frey, Daniel; Modestino, Miguel A.								Understanding Bubble-Induced Overpotential Losses in Multiphase Flow Electrochemical Reactors								ENERGY & FUELS											10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c01543		JUL 2022			2022	Green hydrogen production via water electrolysis can play a significant role in decarbonizing energy and multiple industrial processes. In this electrolysis process, water molecules are oxidized to produce oxygen in the anode, while protons are reduced to hydrogen in the cathode. Both of these electrochemical products are gaseous species that lead to bubble nucleation at the surface of electrodes. This bubble evolution phenomena results in substantial energy losses due to the blockage of ion conduction pathways, reduction of the available electrocatalytic area, and disruption of concentration gradients at the electrode-electrolyte interface. In this study, we implement a microfluidic water electrolyzer to elucidate the impacts of electrochemical reaction conditions and convective flows on bubble-induced overpotential losses. We show that high Reynolds (Re) number flows (i.e., Re > 20) mitigate the formation of large bubbles, resulting in minimal bubble-induced overpotential losses. For flows with smaller Re, periodic evolution of large bubbles leads to overpotential fluctuations on the order of similar to 100 mV. Furthermore, to understand the impact of bubbles on concentration overpotentials, we use fluorescence microscopy and pH sensitive dyes to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of pH gradients and correlate the strength and shape of these gradients to the applied potential and convective forces. We find that the presence of large bubbles at low Re can result in more severe concentration gradients that are affected by the hydrodynamic flows around the bubbles. The findings presented in this work provide insights into the effects of convective flows in mitigating bubble-induced overpotential losses.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000829237300001

The assemblies were prepared by electrostatic adsorption of citrate-stabilized Pd nanoparticles on poly-L-lysine treated mica. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies of the adsorption process provided information on the nanoparticle number density as a function of the adsorption time. The HER kinetics was determined by examining SECM feedback approach curves, employing the methyl viologen ((MV2(+/+.))) couple as the redox probe. With this configuration, the potential of the Pd nanoparticles is effectively determined by the local concentration ratio of the redox probe. The overpotential for proton reduction can be finely tuned by the concentration of the redox species, the size of the ultramicroelectrode (UME) tip, and the distance between the UME and the nanoparticle assembly. The SECM analysis allowed the mean exchange current density per Pd nanoparticle [j(0(pH = 3)) = (1.19 +/- 0.08) x 10(-6) A cm(-2)] to be evaluated. Significantly, the SECM methodology described is highly sensitive to the transfer coefficient of the HER, with a value of 0.5 providing the most satisfactory fit in the overpotential range investigated. It is concluded that the reactivity of the Pd nanoparticles is comparable to the bulk metal, which is consistent with the bulk-like electronic structure of Pd clusters of this dimension.									43	3	0	0	6	0	43			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000257155200025

On the way to maximize the anti-poisoning sensitivity of nonenzymatic electrochemical glucose sensors as well as achieve favorable selectivity, we propose here a porous interface fabricated by a facile but effective approach for glucose monitoring in alkaline media containing dissolved oxygen. The sensing interface based on porous Cu foams is directly formed on a homemade disposable screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) substrate by electrodeposition assisted with hydrogen evolution simultaneously, and its porosity can be easily tailored through adjusting deposition conditions for the optimal electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose molecules. SEM and BET studies show that the generated Cu foam possesses robust hierarchical porous architectures with greatly enhanced surface area and pore volume, beneficial for the unimpeded mobility of glucose and reaction products. Cyclic voltammetric tests indicate that a diffusion-controlled glucose electro-oxidation reaction occurs at the Cu foam electrode at around +0.35 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.1 M NaOH. Chronoamperometric results obtained under optimized conditions reveal that the proposed sensor exhibits desired poison resistance ability in the presence of chloride ions and significant selectivity to glucose, providing fascinating sensitivities of 2.57 and 1.81 mA cm(-2) mM(-1) for glucose in the linear concentration ranges of 2-80 mu M and 0.1-5 mM, respectively. The limit of detection is calculated to be as low as 0.98 mu M according to the signal-to-noise ratio of three. In addition, the fabricated sensing interface shows attractive reproducibility (RSD of 5.1% and 7.0% for 15 repeated measurements on a sensor and for measurements on 15 prepared sensors, respectively) and outstanding long-term stability (less than 5% loss in sensitivity over 1 month) for glucose detection. The application of the Cu foam based sensor for monitoring glucose in practical samples is also successfully demonstrated. 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The results demonstrate that the MgO/g-C3N4 nanocomposites can effectively harvest sunlight to produce hydrogen from water with higher photocatalytic efficiency than the bare g-C3N4 . A high hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of 30.1 mu mol h (-1) was achieved under visible light for the MgO/g-C3N4 composite loaded with 1 wt% MgO, which is much higher than that of the bare g-C3N4 (5.76 mu mol h (-1)). The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the MgO/g-C3N4 composite could be attributed to the formation of heterojunction between g-C3N4 and MgO that promotes the photo-induced charge carriers' transmission and separation.									53	5	1	0	10	0	53			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000459458600017

Recently, porous metal oxide/semiconductor junctions have shown that flat-band potentials (V-fb), representing interface energetics, could be dynamically changed with PEC reactions. However, it remains unclear as to what structural and physical specificities of the porous metal oxide induce the dynamic V-fb. Herein, it is demonstrated that the electrolyte permeability and nanocrystal structure of porous NiOx are crucial for the dynamic V-fb in porous NiOx integrated Si photocathodes. A comparison of the dense and porous NiOx with electrolyte impermeable and permeable features, respectively, shows that V-fb changes only in the porous NiOx. The porous NiOx also exhibits a nanocrystal structure and increased V-fb values with a decrease in nanocrystal size. As a result of the increased V-fb, the porous NiOx achieves much higher PEC performance compared to that of the dense NiOx. However, electrolyte permeability causes electrochemical decomposition of the Si component. Thus, a cointegration of the porous and dense NiOx bilayers, which ensures stable PEC operation for 10 h while achieving high potentials of 0.2 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode at a photocurrent of 10 mA cm(-2), is proposed.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2366-7486			WOS:000452462200001

Therefore, as high-efficiency electrocatalysts for hydrogen reduction reaction (HER), supported metal nanoclusters (NCs) with maximum metal atom efficiency are promising, yet the genuine mechanism involving rational orbital modulation is still arguable. Herein, the conjugating effect between electron-donor boron (B)-tethering engineering and iridium (Ir) that facilitates the electron capture of Ir atoms is explored, achieving highly dispersive Ir-NCs confined in N, B co-doped defective carbon (Ir@NBD-C). The Ir@NBD-C catalyst achieves displays remarkable high activity for HER in a pH-universal range, in particular, with an ultralow overpotential of 7 mV (10 mA cm(-2)), high mass activity of 652.2 A gIr-1, and turnover frequency (TOF) of 1.90 H-2 S-1 (100 mV) in 1.0 m KOH, outperforming almost all state-of-the-art HER electrocatalysts. Operando characterizations and theoretical calculations unveil that the outstanding catalytic activity can attribute to the optimal binding to hydrogen intermediate species (H*) derived from the tunable and favorable electronic structure of the Ir site through the tethering of B heteroatoms. Undoubtedly, this work brings new insight into the design of catalysts with high intrinsic activity and thermodynamic stability.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000754185000001

Herein, we demonstrate a strategy for fabricating three-dimensional (3D) Cu-encased N-doped carbon nanotube arrays which are directly grown on Cu foam (Cu@NC NT/CF) as a new efficient HER electrocatalyst. Cu nanoparticles are encased here instead of common transition metals (Fe, Co, or Ni) for pursuing a well-controllable morphology and an excellent activity by taking advantage of its more stable nature at high temperature and in acidic or alkaline electrolyte. It is discovered that metallic Cu exhibits strong electronic modulation on N-doped carbon to boost its electrocatalytic activity for HER. Such a nanostructure not only offers plenty of accessible highly active sites but also provides a 3D conductive open network for fast electron/mass transfer and facilitates gas escape for prompt mass exchange. As a result, the Cu@NC NT/CF electrode exhibits superior HER performance and durability, outperforming most of the reported M@NC materials. Furthermore, the etching experiments together with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis reveal that the electronic modulation from encased Cu significantly enhances the HER activity of N-doped carbon. These findings open up opportunities for exploring other Cu-based nanomaterials as efficient electrocatalysts and understanding their catalytic processes.									64	2	0	0	2	0	65			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000414115700040	28972733

In this study we examine r-process nucleosynthesis in a "prompt supernova explosion" from an 8-10 M-circle dot progenitor star as an alternative scenario to the "neutrino wind" mechanism, which has also been considered a promising site of the r-process. In the present model, the progenitor star has formed an oxygen-neon-magnesium (O-Ne-Mg) core (of mass 1.38 M-circle dot) at its center. Its smaller gravitational potential, as well as the smaller core that is in nuclear statistical equilibrium at the time of core bounce, as compared with the iron cores in more massive stars, may allow the star to explode hydrodynamically rather than by delayed neutrino heating. The core-collapse simulations are performed with a one-dimensional, Newtonian hydrodynamic code. We obtain a very weak prompt explosion in which no r-processing occurs. We further simulate energetic prompt explosions by enhancement of the shock-heating energy in order to investigate conditions necessary for the production of r-process nuclei in such events. The r-process nucleosynthesis is calculated using a nuclear reaction network code including relevant neutron-rich isotopes with reactions among them. The highly neutronized ejecta (Y-e approximate to 0.14-0.20) lead to robust production of r-process nuclei; their relative abundances are in excellent agreement with the solar r-process pattern. Our results suggest that prompt explosions of 8-10 M-circle dot stars with O-Ne-Mg cores can be a promising site of r-process nuclei. The mass of the r-process material per event is about 2 orders of magnitude larger than that expected from Galactic chemical evolution studies. We propose, therefore, that only a small fraction of r-process material is ejected via "mixing-fallback" mechanism of the core matter, wherein most of the r-process material falls back onto the proto-neutron star. A lower limit on the age of the universe is derived by application of the uranium-thorium (U-Th) chronometer pair by comparison with the observed ratio of these species in the highly r-process-enhanced, extremely metal poor star CS 31082-001. The inferred age is 14.1 +/- 2.4 Gyr - the same as that obtained previously based on the neutrino wind scenario with the same nuclear mass formula. This suggests that chronometric estimates obtained using the U-Th pair are independent of the astrophysical conditions considered.									119	2	1	0	0	0	122			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000184823400028		
J	Lee, Sang-Kwon; Kramer, Daniel; Macdonald, Digby D.								On the shape of stress corrosion cracks in sensitized Type 304 SS in Boiling Water Reactor primary coolant piping at 288 degrees C								JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS				454	1-3			359	372		10.1016/j.jnucmat.2014.08.022				NOV 2014	2014	Evolution of the shape of surface cracks in sensitized Type 304 SS in Boiling Water Reactor primary coolant circuit piping at the reactor operating temperature of 288 degrees C is explored as a function of various environmental variables, such as electrochemical potential (ECP), solution conductivity, flow velocity, and multiplier for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) standard exchange current density (SECD), using the coupled environment fracture model (CEFM). For this work, the CEFM was upgraded by incorporating Shoji's model for calculating the crack tip strain rate and more advanced expressions were used for estimating the stress intensity factor for semi-elliptical surface cracks. This revised CEFM accurately predicts the dependence of the crack growth rate on stress intensity factor and offers an alternative explanation for the development of semi-elliptical cracks than that provided by fracture mechanics alone. The evolution of surface crack semi-elliptical shape depends strongly upon various environmental variables identified above, and the CEFM predicts that the minor axis of the ellipse should be oriented perpendicular to the surface, in agreement with observation. The development of the observed semi-elliptical cracks with the minor axis perpendicular to the surface is therefore attributed to the dependence of the crack growth rate on the electrochemical crack length.

We, first, start with a brief description of the reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME) in a spatially discretized simulation volume ("mesh"), which is divided into sub-volumes (or "voxels"). We then discuss the choice of voxel size and merging technique of a given mesh, along with the evolution of the system using the hierarchical algorithm for the RDME ("hRDME"). Since the compartment-based model cannot describe high concentration species of early radiation-induced spurs, we propose a combination of the particle-based step-by-step ("SBS") Brownian dynamics model and the compartment-based model ("SBS-RDME model") for the simulation. We, finally, use the particle-based SBS Brownian dynamics model of Geant4-DNA as a reference to test the model implementation through several benchmarks. We find that the compartment-based model can efficiently simulate the system with a large number of species and for longer timescales, beyond the microsecond, with a reasonable computing time. Our aim in developing this model is to study the production and evolution of reactive oxygen species generated under irradiation with different dose rate conditions, such as in FLASH and conventional radiotherapy.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3				1422-0067		WOS:000660218300001	34199598

Common chemical N-doping to the carbon support can providepossibilities for enhanced electrocatalysis but most often leads to random interaction withPt nanoparticles (Pt-NPs) and uncontrollable tuning of the heavy d-pi effect. Directionalconfinement of Pt-NPs within N-doped carbon to directly enhance the heavy d-pi effect istherefore mostly preferred but rarely reported. Herein, confined ultrafine Pt-NPs in N-doped porous carbonfibers (Pt@NDPCF) were obtained by a combination methodinvolving electrospinning, carbonization, and directional replacement. Such a syntheticstrategy leads to highly dispersed, ultrafine Pt-NPs in hierarchically porous carbonfibersand a strong directional interaction of Pt with pyridinic N, which significantly enhancesthe heavy d-pi effect, greatly facilitating electron transfer and optimizing Pt 5d orbitals.Based on these advances, Pt@NDPCF exhibited outstanding activity and superiordurability in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with 24 mV lower overpotential at10 mA cm-2and a much smaller activity loss after 10,000 cycles of durability tests in comparison with a commercial Pt/C catalyst.This work sheds new lights on the design of high-performance Pt-based nanomaterials toward HER or other practical applications									4	1	0	0	1	0	4			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000795962300011

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition has been shown in animal models of retinopathy and in patients with diabetes to improve retinal neovascularization. The mechanism is not clearly identified, but could potentially be mediated via vascular endothelial growth factor modification. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on retinal VEGF, VEGF-R1, and VEGF-R2 expression in a mouse model of oxygen induced retinopathy (OIR).Methods. A mouse model of OIR was used and retinal tissue was obtained at P7, prior to oxygen exposure, at P12, just after oxygen exposure, and at P17, the time of maximal retinal neovascularization for VEGF, VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 assessment. A group of animals were treated with captopril (0.5 mg/kg/d SC from P7 for five days).Results. Captopril plus OIR treated animals had higher levels of retinal VEGF mRNA and protein at P12 (p<0.05) and lower levels at P17 (p<0.05) than OIR animals. VEGF-R1 mRNA expression increased 16 fold from P7 to P17 (p<0.05) in room air reared animals. VEGF-R1 mRNA expression was unaffected by OIR and/or captopril treatment. VEGF-R2 mRNA expression decreased from P7 to P17 by 1.5-fold in room air reared animals (p=0.001). Retinal VEGF-R2 mRNA and protein expression were significantly higher at P12 in OIR plus captopril treated animals than OIR animals (p=0.01).Conclusions. In summary, captopril maintains VEGF and increases VEGF-R2 expression during the period of hyperoxia when VEGF expression is normally suppressed. Captopril treatment during oxygen exposure is associated with a reduction in the angiogenic response at day 17 as manifested by decreased VEGF and VEGF-R2 expression in retinal tissue. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition is associated with changes in expression of VEGF and VEGF-R2 in the evolution of retinal neovascularization in the mouse model of retinopathy.									14	2	0	0	11	0	16			0271-3683			WOS:000185227300009	14632165

Due to the low operation temperature, TiO2 by the plasma method shows higher specific surface area and smaller particle size than that prepared via conventional calcination. Most interestingly, electron impact produces more oxygen vacancy on TiO2, which facilitates the recombination and formation of heterostructure of g-C3N4/TiO2. The composites have higher light absorption capacity and lower charge recombination efficiency. g-C3N4/TiO2 by plasma can produce hydrogen at a rate of 219.9 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1) and completely degrade Rhodamine B (20mg.L-1) in two hours. Its hydrogen production rates were 3 and 1.5 times higher than that by calcination and pure g-C3N4, respectively. Electron impact, ozone and oxygen radical also play key roles in plasma preparation. Plasma has unique advantages in metal oxides defect engineering and the preparation of heterostructured composites with prospective applications as photocatalysts for pollutant degradation and water splitting.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5				2079-4991		WOS:000539577200208	32340144

Combining FDTD and Curing Kinetic Equations to Model the Degree of Conversion Evolution of UV-Curable Systems								INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH				60	19			7174	7186		10.1021/acs.iecr.1c01213		MAY 2021		MAY 19 2021	2021	The degree of conversion (DoC) is significantly linked with many material properties of a UV-cured resin. The current curing kinetic models provide insight into how DoC evolves with depth for a pure resin subject to plane wave, light propagation. However, they do not accurately describe how DoC evolves within UV-curable composites or systems in which multidirectional ray propagation and interference are in play. This paper describes a simulation framework for predicting the spatial and temporal eand the propagation is alovolution of DoC within a UV-curable composite. The framework uses Maxwell's laws of electromagnetic theory and a series of finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations to predict light intensity distribution at different reaction time steps. It also uses curing kinetic models and optical property models to predict DoC and optical properties within a volume. The framework was applied to simulate the photoinduced, free-radical polymerization of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate/2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenyl acetophenone (PEGDA/DMPA)-based composites. It was used to study the influence of the resin refractive index, the filler refractive index, and the filler particle size on the spatial and temporal evolution of DoC. The predictions of DoC evolution were in agreement with both theoretical and experimental results published in the research literature. The simulations also revealed that (1) the change of the resin refractive index during polymerization has a significant impact on both light propagation and DoC within a UV-curable composite, (2) smaller fillers scatter more light than larger fillers, and (3) larger refractive index mismatch between the resin and filler leads to more light scattering and greater light attenuation. In turn, this increases the polymerization rate at shallow depths but decreases it at greater depths.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0888-5885			WOS:000655249200026

Significant research has been reported to advance this approach. However, the use of organic photocatalysts and the presence of residual catalysts trapped in the porous frameworks present major concerns about the efficiency of this strategy. Herein, we report the photocatalytic evolution of H-2 and O-2 by a multi-hydroxyl group-decorated metalloporphyrin-based two-dimensional catalyst developed via metal catalyst-free synthetic route. Though metalloporphyrins have long been used for catalytic functions, a heterogeneous photocatalyst delivering both H-2 and O-2 has not yet been realized. This polymer catalyst design enables the photocatalytic diatomic O-2 release, a bottleneck in water splitting, in a facile way. Photocatalytic release of H-2 as well as O-2 occurs with long-term durability of 20 cycles in 300 days with negligible decrease in efficiency, thus demonstrating the excellent performance of this new catalyst.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000457645500019	30657137

Recent research has focused on finding new materials with active basal planes. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate that the hexagonal vdW Fe3GeTe2 (FGT), also a spintronic candidate material, shows both basal plane and edge site HER activities. Partial exfoliation of bulk FGT through sonication increases both basal plane and edge sites leading to significantly improved overpotential. A subsequent compacting of the sample (using plasma sintering at room temperature) to produce a densified electrode leads to an impressive overpotential to drive a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) of -0.105 V. DFT free energy calculations not only showed that the high activity is due to the abundant active sites present on the hexagonal Te layer in FGT but also presented an even more HER active layer (106) containing both iron and tellurium active sites. Furthermore, the presence of a thin oxide layer on top of the active FGT layers, as found by XPS, suggests that the real active surface is likely a hybrid FGT/oxide layer. These results demonstrate the high basal plane and edge sites HER activity of FGT, thus opening a new avenue for the design and screening of related iron-based vdW materials, their composites, and their surface functionalization as high-performing electrocatalysts.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2639-4979		WOS:000637873500002

The deficiency in light harvesting capacity of PSII caused by the Cu-induced chlorophyll loss may result in the energy distribution of the two photosystems being out of balance. Copper decreased maximal fluorescence (F-m, F-m') and changes at the variable fluorescence were also observed. The reduction state of the primary electron acceptor (Q(A)) of PSII in leaves resulted in changes due to the imbalance between the rate of Q(A) reduction by PSII activity and the rate of Q(A)(-) reoxidation by PSI activity. Copper treatment also resulted in a dramatic decrease of Rfd (vitality index), a moderate decrease in PES (energy storage) and a marginal decrease in F-v'/F-m' values. High Cu concentrations inhibit O-2 evolution and the enhanced heat emission may be due to an inhibition of electron transfer and consequently of photochemistry. Thlaspi leaves maintained an increased capacity for PSI-driven energy storing electron flow, since measurements of 820 nm absorbance changes in saturating far-red light indicated less pronounced changes in the reaction center of PSI (P-700) activity after Cu exposure compared with that of PSII.									37	2	1	0	32	0	42			0168-9452	1873-2259		WOS:A1996TU07100013

The role of Cu ions in enhancement of photocatalytic evolution of H-2 from H2O-methanol/glycerol mixtures in both sunlight and UV-visible irradiation over Cu/Ti oxides was investigated. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), supported by X-ray diffraction and Raman studies, revealed that Cu substitution in TiO2 stabilized anatase lattice, lengthened Ti-O bonds, decreased the coordination number around Cu ions, and induced oxygen ion vacancies and distortion (sigma) in lattice. Distorted structures are more open and flexible with improved charge carrier dynamics and favourable photo catalytic properties. Nanosized Cu-Ti-O powders with enhanced N-2-BET surface area and microporosity exhibited improved photocatalytic properties. Reduction of CuO to photocatalytically more active Cu2O by photo-generated e(-) on the surface of composites was evident by the absence of Cu2+ peak in the XPS spectra of the composite sample after exposure to light. The most active formulations for sunlight assisted photocatalytic H-2 generation were Cu0.02Ti0.98O2 for the doped samples, referred to as CuTi(2), and xCuO-yTiO(2)(x:y=2:8) for the composite samples. Performance of the most active, CuTi(2), was monitored in a up-scaled photoreactor in order to investigate the influence of illumination area, catalyst concentration, form of catalyst (powder/films) and different sacrificial agents on H-2 yield. With an aim to identify practical materials for pilot plants, 6 mg of CuTi(2) was dispersed on (30 cm x 0.7 cm) ITO/PET films that exhibited enhanced efficiency (3.06%) as compared to same amount of CuTi(2) powder (1.41%). The results showed that the utilization of the CuTi(2) photocatalyst (without costly cocatalysts) with the proper selection of optimum operational conditions under sunlight in a up-scaled photoreactor, generated H-2 yield of 1.167 L/h/m(2) with apparent quantum efficiency, AQE, of 7.5% and solar to fuel efficiency, SFE, of 3.9% for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Our results suggest that with this efficiency, H-2 at 1 L/h would be evolved photocatalytically over 0.9 m(2) of CuTi(2) photocatalyst, exposed to sunlight. Inputs obtained from the present study will be useful for further scale up of sunlight driven photocatalytic hydrogen production over low cost and efficient Cu modified TiO2. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of such temperature rise will be more prominent in hill stream fishes like Chocolate mahseer because of their evolution in hilly environments and adaptation to low temperature. Here we examine the thermal tolerance, oxygen consumption and stress response in this fish species acclimatized at three different temperatures (24 degrees C, 27 degrees C and 30 degrees C) for 45 days. The study reveals that CTmax and LTmax increased significantly (P < 0.05) with increasing acclimation temperature. Similarly, oxygen consumption rate at 24 degrees C, 27 degrees C and 30 degrees C was 74.61 +/- 2.11, 94.32 +/- 2.33 and 122.54 +/- 2.01 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1) respectively. Further, among the three acclimated temperatures tested, fishes reared at 24 degrees C when subjected to thermal tolerance test encountered more stress (glucose level: 11.6 +/- 1.14 mmol/l) than other groups (27 degrees C: 9.22 +/- 0.22 mmol/l; 30 degrees C: 7.4 +/- 0.89 mmol/l). Results suggest that water temperature of 31 degrees C and beyond in natural water bodies of Meghalaya might create physiological stress in Chocolate mahseer, which in the long run may affect its reproductive performance. Therefore, we recommend adoption of proven in situ and ex situ conservation approaches to safeguard the species.									8	0	0	0	7	0	8			0011-3891			WOS:000323588300020

Conventional coating methods necessitate the use of binder components that often block pores and active sites, which limits catalytic efficiency, and utilization of expensive active metals. We report an approach for the direct and binder-free synthesis of chemically, mechanically, and thermally stable catalytic coatings based on ordered mesoporous carbon films employed as catalyst support. The synthesis relies on the codeposition of a structure directing agent and small clusters of polymeric carbon precursors along with ionic metal species on a substrate. A sequence of thermal treatments converts the polymer into partly graphitized carbon, decomposes the structure-directing agent, and converts the metal precursor into highly active nanoparticles. Syntheses and catalytic applications are exemplarily demonstrated for palladium on carbon, a system widely used in heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis. The obtained catalysts provide significantly higher space time yields in the selective gas-phase hydrogenation of butadiene than all reported Pd/C catalysts while at the same time retaining isothermal reactor conditions. Moreover, when they were tested in the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the catalysts outperformed reported Pd/C catalysts by a factor of 3, which underlines the benefits of the developed binder-free catalyst system.									21	1	0	0	0	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000389399400030

In this work, we designed novel cyanate-intercalated CoBi layered double hydroxide (CICB-LDH) nanorods as highly active IR-photocatalyst by the one-pot inclusion of highly active (Bin+)-species with Co in an organic-inorganic hybrid nanocomposite. The synthesis route leads to the formation of abundant triple bonded (CN)-groups of superior trapping functions towards the photoexcited species, and in-turn elevated water splitting performance without the need for external scavengers. Based on the diffuse reflectance and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses, CICB-LDH owns the narrower bandgap (1.32 eV) and much higher oxidation states of (Bi) compared to all the reported Co/Bi-structures, leading to superior photocatalytic activity. In the challenge oxygen evolution (OE)-reaction, CICB-LDH has achieved the maximum (OE)-rate of 5455 mu molgxfffd; 1h- 1 without noble co-promoters.

Triple point phases of different cobalt-copper-oxides are formed in the reaction zone and are origin of micro-cracks and stress concentration. Therefore, their identification is necessary for understanding the microstructure evolution and designing the interface structure advantageously by an adapted brazing process. However, as the cobalt-copper-oxide system can form many different oxides with solubility of Co and Cu respectively, different analytical methods are necessary for identification. TEM diffraction is used for the correct identification of the occurring crystal structures, EBSD is used for analysis of composition, arrangement and orientation of the triple point phases and EPMA is used to confirm the crystal structures identified by EBSD and to determine the elemental concentrations. As the triple point phases consist of small grains with unpredictable forms and especially, Cu-Ka can excite Co-Ka by characteristic secondary fluorescence, different evaluation procedures for EPMA are performed on FIB lamellae: 1) Approach based on standard lamellae, where FIB lamellae from standards are used to determine the k-factor in dependence of the mass thickness t/lambda, and 2) Monte Carlo simulation approach, where an iterative procedure is used to calculate the k-ratios, based on bulk standards. The use of FIB lamellae allows excluding the fluorescence effect and incorrect Monte Carlo simulations due to incorrect assumptions of the microstructure below the surface, which is within the excitation volume.					16th European Workshop of the European-Microbeam-Analysis-Society (EMAS) on Modern Developments and Applications in Microbeam Analysis (EMAS)16th European Workshop of the European-Microbeam-Analysis-Society (EMAS) on Modern Developments and Applications in Microbeam Analysis (EMAS)	MAY 19-23, 2019MAY 19-23, 2019	European Microbeam Anal Soc; Ametek GmbH, Edax Business Unit; Ametek, CAMECA Business Unit; Bruker Nano GmbH; European Commiss, JRC Directorate G Nucl Safety & Secur; Jeol; Micro Nano; Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol; Probe Software; NordicNano Solut AB; Target Messtechnik; TESCAN ORSAY HOLDING a s; Thermo Fisher SciEuropean Microbeam Anal Soc; Ametek GmbH, Edax Business Unit; Ametek, CAMECA Business Unit; Bruker Nano GmbH; European Commiss, JRC Directorate G Nucl Safety & Secur; Jeol; Micro Nano; Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol; Probe Software; NordicNano Solut AB; Target Messtechnik; TESCAN ORSAY HOLDING a s; Thermo Fisher Sci	Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Realfagbygget, Trondheim, NORWAYNorwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Realfagbygget, Trondheim, NORWAY	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1757-8981		*****************	WOS:000615715400012		
J	Dong, Shan-Shan; Shao, Wen-Zhu; Yang, Li; Ye, Hui-Jian; Zhen, Liang				Shao, Wenzhu/K-1254-2013				Microstructure evolution of polyimide films induced by electron beam irradiation-load coupling treatment								POLYMER DEGRADATION AND STABILITY				155				230	237		10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2018.07.020				SEP 2018	2018	Polyimide films are widely used in space with extreme environments, where high energy beam irradiation and corresponding coupling treatment could occur. The combined effect of high energy electrons (1.2 MeV) and high tensile stress (50 MPa) on the degradation behavior of polyimide films was studied by means of scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and mechanical testing. The degradation of polyimide films was evaluated by analyzing the microstructure and mechanical properties. The results indicated that the external tensile stress and irradiation coupling treatment resulted in the breakage of a larger number of chemical bonds and greater deterioration of the surface quality when compared with the irradiated polyimide samples. After irradiation-load coupling treatment, numerous micro-cracks were formed on the polyimide surface, facilitating the diffusion of oxygen into polyimide films and thus increasing the probability of free radical reactions. Moreover, the coupling treatment led to a more significant decrease in tensile strength and elongation of polyimide films by 10% and 35%, respectively. The mechanism of molecular chains' scission and crosslinking as well as correlations between molecular chains and mechanical performances were discussed. The obtained results indicated that the external tensile stress accelerates the degradation process during electron beam irradiation; thus, the tensile stress potentially seriously deteriorates polyimide film properties in irradiated environments.

The evolution of surface morphology, microstructure and reaction between C and Si was examined by high resolution scanning/transmission electron microscope. Raman and FTIR spectroscopy. The hardness of films was investigated using nano-indentation. After 750-900 degrees C annealing, the hardness of single carbon layer greatly decreased at 750 degrees C and then slightly increased at 900 degrees C due to the formation of SiC at the interface between the single C film and the Si substrate. In contrast, no significant variation occurred on the hardness of two-layer Si/C film under RTA at 750-900 degrees C. Although the higher annealing temperature resulted in higher sp(2)/sp(3) bonding ratio as well as more sp(2) bonding formation in the carbon layer to soften the structure, the added Si top-layer can protect DLC from reaction with environmental oxygen and sustain the hardness of the composite film because of the multiphasic formation with extra SiC on the surface and at the interface between the C layer and Si substrate through great interdiffusion between Si and C for extending DLC high-temperature application.

J	Boateng, AA; Hicks, KB; Vogel, KP								Pyrolysis of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) harvested at several stages of maturity								JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL AND APPLIED PYROLYSIS				75	2			55	64		10.1016/j.jaap.2005.03.005				MAR 2006	2006	The pyrolysis of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) of the cultivar, "Cave-in-Rock" harvested at three stages of physiological maturity was studied in a PY-GC/MS system at the 600-1050 degrees C temperature range. Under these conditions, the decomposition was complete within 20 s yielding char, and two sets of pyrolysis gas, condensable and non-condensable. The former consisted of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), acetic acid (CH3COOH) and higher molecular weight compounds possibly from the hydroxyl group and from the methoxy groups of the cell wall components. The non-condensable gases were mainly CO, CO2 and C-1-C-3 hydrocarbons. For these, there was a 900 degrees C temperature boundary where dramatic change occurred in their evolution rates. Below this temperature, CO2 decreased but CO and the C-1-C-3 hydrocarbons increased almost linearly with temperature. Above this temperature boundary, the hydrocarbons leveled off but there was a rapid rise in CO and CO2 evolution at a constant CO/CO2 ratio. These suggest the appearance of secondary or tertiary pyrolysis reactions involving rearrangement and release of CO and hydrocarbons prior to this temperature boundary and the release of CO and CO2 from the tightly bond oxygen functionalities including C-C bonds thereafter. At <750 degrees C, there were modest increases in condensable gas yield and decrease in non-condensable gas due to differences in plant maturity at harvest. However, the effect of switchgrass physiological maturity on gas yield was statistically insignificant at high temperatures. The energy content of the non-condensable gas measured was about 68% of the gross energy content of the biomass for the early harvest crop and 80% for the mature crop. The activation energy for the decomposition, estimated assuming first order reaction kinetics, showed a linear increase with plant physiological maturity. The results demonstrate that physiological maturity at harvest of switchgrass biomass can result in different concentrations of pyrolysis products at different temperatures. These results also demonstrate the need for additional research with a broader array of herbaceous biomass materials to develop a better understanding of the synergies of crop cultivation, harvesting and processing of dedicated herbaceous biomass energy crops during their thermochemical conversion.

J	Zhang, Chunhui; Zhang, Litao; Liu, Jianguo								The role of photorespiration during astaxanthin accumulation in Haematococcus pluvialis (Chlorophyceae)								PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY				107				75	81		10.1016/j.plaphy.2016.05.029				OCT 2016	2016	Most previous studies on Haematococcus pluvialis have been focused on growth and astaxanthin accumulation. However, the relationships between photorespiration and astaxanthin accumulation have not been clarified. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of photorespiration during the process of astaxanthin accumulation in H. pluvialis. During astaxanthin accumulation, the astaxanthin content was reduced significantly when photorespiration was inhibited by its specific inhibitor, carboxymethoxylamine. The inhibition of photorespiration did not change the dry weight, chlorophyll content and OJIP transients during the incubation; however, the inhibition of photorespiration significantly decreased the photochemistry of photosystem II and total photosynthetic O-2 evolution capacity. Moreover, the restriction in photorespiration was synchronized with a decrease of astaxanthin accumulation. These results suggest that the photorespiratory pathway in H. pluvialis can accelerate astaxanthin accumulation. We speculate that photorespiration can enhance astaxanthin accumulation in the following ways: (i) photorespiration directly affects the glycerate-3-phosphate (PGA) level, which is intrinsically related to the accumulation of astaxanthin in H. pluvialis; (ii) the photorespiratory pathway indirectly affects the PGA level by effecting the dark reactions of photosynthesis, which then results in the enhancement of astaxanthin accumulation in H. pluvialis.

However, the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency, long-term stability, and cost-effectiveness in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) still need to be improved. Herein, an efficient approach is demonstrated to produce low-dimensional Pt/graphene-carbon nanofibers (CNFs)-based heterostructures for bias-free, highly efficient, and durable HER. Carbon dots are used as efficient building blocks for the in situ formation of graphene along the CNFs surface. The presence of graphene enhances the electronic conductivity of CNFs to approximate to 3013.5 S m(-1) and simultaneously supports the uniform Pt clusters growth and efficient electron transport during HER. The electrode with a low Pt loading amount (3.4 mu g cm(-2)) exhibits a remarkable mass activity of HER in both acidic and alkaline media, which is significantly better than that of commercial Pt/C (31 mu g cm(-2) of Pt loading). In addition, using a luminescent solar concentrator-coupled solar cell to provide voltage, the bias-free water splitting system exhibits an STH efficiency of 0.22% upon one-sun illumination. These results are promising toward using low-dimensional heterostructured catalysts for future energy storage and conversion applications.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			2366-9608			WOS:000760886200001	35212473

In the experiments, different non flammable mixtures of H-2 + O-2 (with N-2 as diluent) react catalytically to form H2O on a Pt-wire at a total pressure of 1 atm. The transient behavior from the ignition point to the state controlled by mass transport was measured via the temperature of the Pt-wire. These zero flow experiments were simulated by a code which describes reacting flows with diffusion, heat balance and detailed surface kinetics. The evolution of the catalyst's temperature, the surface coverages and the gradients in the reactants' concentrations and temperature were calculated. Good agreement was obtained between the experiments and the simulations. The results provide new insight into both the mechanism of catalytic ignition and the relative importance of reaction kinetics and mass transfer at different stages. Catalytic ignition of H-2 + O-2 is primarily governed by coupling between: (i) the heat balance, (ii) the kinetics of adsorption of H-2 and O-2, and (iii) the desorption kinetics of H-2. The model presented can be applied to ignition or combustion, where heterogeneous processes are coupled to those in the gaseous phase.

The photocatalyst was characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, N-2 adsorption/desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques, photoluminescence spectra and photoelectrochemical measurements. The photocatalytic activities were evaluated by the degradation of methyl blue (MB) under visible light irradiation. The results indicated that the synthesized monoclinic BiVO4 had a shuriken shape. The TiO2 nanosheets (NSs) with dominant {0 0 1} facets adhered uniformly on the surface of BiVO4, forming the heterojunction structure. The obtained BiVO4/TiO2 showed about 1.4 times and 8.9 times higher photocatalytic activity than that of the bare BiVO4 and physical mixture BiVO2_TiO2 sample, respectively, which can be attributed to the synergistic effect of BiVO4/TiO2 heterojunction and TiO2 NSs. The incorporation of TiO2 not only did not affect the visible light absorption ability of BiVO4, but also improved the specific surface area as well as pore diameter, which suggesting a better adsorption ability for pollutants. More importantly, the formed heterojunction between m-BiVO4 and TiO2 significantly improved the separation efficiency of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. These factors contribute to the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. A possible mechanism was also proposed to understand the origin of enhanced performance in the heterojunction system.

A study of mass-independent O-17 anomalies in H2O2 can provide additional insights into the chemistry of the modern atmosphere and, possibly, of the ancient atmosphere. Here, we report the results of laboratory experiments to study the fractionation of three oxygen isotopes (O-16, O-17, and O-18) during H2O2 formation from products of water vapour dissociation. The experiments were carried out by passing an electrical discharge through a gaseous mixture of helium and water at atmospheric pressure. The effect of the presence of O-2 in the gas mixture on the isotopic composition of H2O2 was also investigated. All of the experiments showed that H2O2 produced under two different conditions (with or without O-2 added in the gas mixtures) was mass-independently fractionated (MIF). We found a positive MIF signal (similar to 1.4 parts per thousand) in the no-O-2 added experiments, and this signal increased to similar to 2.5 parts per thousand once O-2 was added (1.6% mixing ratio). We suggest that if O-2 concentrations are very low, the hydroxyl radical recombination reaction is the dominant pathway for H2O2 formation and is the source of MIF in H2O2. Although H2O2 formation via a hydroxyl radical recombination process is limited in the modern atmosphere, it would be possible in the Archean atmosphere when O-2 was a trace constituent, and H2O2 would be mass-independently fractionated. The anomalous O-17 excess, which was observed in H2O2 produced by spark discharge experiments, may provide useful information about the radical chemistry of the ancient atmosphere and the role of H2O2 in maintaining and controlling the atmospheric composition.

J	Schmitt, M; Paulmier, D; Le Huu, T								Influence of diamond crystal orientation on their tribological behaviour under various environments								THIN SOLID FILMS				343		SI		226	229		10.1016/S0040-6090(98)01631-9				APR 1999	1999	Tribological properties of diamond coatings are very complex; if the wear rates remain very low, the friction coefficient is in a large range of values. This behaviour can be explained by: (a) the deposition method: the way the dangling bonds are saturated is not the same depending on whether diamond is obtained by chemical vapour deposition (hydrogen saturation) or combustion flame method (oxygen saturation); (b) by the intrinsic properties of diamond crystals which also take a predominant part in the tribological behaviour. In particular, a change in the growth direction induces different physico-chemical properties for the coatings, and consequently modifies their friction coefficient and its evolution with time. The aim of this paper is to highlight the influence of two particular crystal orientations, {111} and {100}, on the friction of the diamond-coated pin/high-speed steel disc couple and on the existence and the importance of the transferred layers. The role of two of the experimental parameters was also studied by realising the tribological tests under various environments (vacuum, oxygen and water vapour) and by applying different normal loads (0.2 N and 1.4 N): the water vapour exposition under low load induces different results for the {111} and {100} oriented coatings. The sliding surfaces were also observed by SEM and analysed by EDS to study the sight and the composition of the transferred layers. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.

Cu3P, as a p-type semiconductor, tends to form a p-n junction with an n-type photocatalyst. Typically, it is treated as a sensitizer to extend the light absorption. However, its function and work mechanism are not fully understood in the catalyst system. In this report, we synthesized g-C3N4 and loaded Cu3P nanoparticle on its surface. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra, photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectra confirm the Cu3P greatly enhance the charge separation process. Electrochemical HER results indicate that the composites have lower over-potential for HER. These results confirm the Cu3P works as a cocatalyst in the system, not a sensitizer. Further, we tracked the photogenerated electron transfer direction via photodeposition of Pt nanoparticles. The Pt nanoparticles tend to deposit near the Cu3P nanoparticles. That illustrates the photogenerated electron will be left on Cu3P nanoparticles. On the other hand, the photocatalytic decomposition of Rhodamine B (RhB) illustrates that the holes are left on the g-C3N4 due to both g-C3N4 and Cu3P/g-C3N4 have similar decomposition rate, but the Cu3P cannot decompose RhB. Based on these, we proposed the photogenerated electron of g-C3N4 recombine with the hole of Cu3P, the photogenerated electron of Cu3P will be left for HER. That reasonably explain the cocatalyst function of Cu3P in the composite catalyst system.									177	8	0	0	18	0	180			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000461002800025

Production of molecular H-2 through electrochemical hydrogen evolution reactions is crucial for the development of clean-energy technologies. The development of economically viable and efficient H-2 production/oxidation catalysts is a key step in the creation of H-2 -based renewable energy infrastructure. Intrinsic limitations of both natural enzymes and synthetic materials have led researchers to explore enzyme-induced catalysts to realize a high current density at a low overpotential. In recent times, highly active widespread numerous electrocatalysts, both homogeneous or heterogeneous (immobilized on the electrode), such as transition metal complexes, heteroatom- or metal-doped nano-carbons, metal-organic frameworks, and other metal derivatives (calix [4] resorcinols, pectates, etc.), which are, to one extent or another, structural or functional analogs of hydrogenases, have been extensively studied as alternatives for Pt-based catalysts, demonstrating prospects for the development of a "hydrogen economy". This mini-review generalizes some achievements in the field of development of new electrocatalysts for H-2 production/oxidation and their application for fuel cells, mainly focuses on the consideration of the catalytic activity of M[P2N2](2)(2+) (M = Ni, Fe) complexes and other nickel structures which have been recently obtained.					21st Mendeleev Congress on General and Applied Chemistry (Mendeleev)21st Mendeleev Congress on General and Applied Chemistry (Mendeleev)	SEP 09-13, 2019SEP 09-13, 2019	IUPACIUPAC	Saint Petersburg, RUSSIASaint Petersburg, RUSSIA	4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0033-4545	1365-3075		WOS:000560550000010

The so-called intrinsic carbon stars (C/O > 1) are formed during the AGB phase evolution of 1.5 <= M/M-circle dot < 3 stars through the mixing of fresh C-12 from the interior of the star into the envelope during the 3rd dredge up after each thermal pulse. They commonly show s-element enhancements produced by slow neutron captures provided by the C-13(alpha, n)O-16 reaction. The prototype of these stars are the AGB C-stars. Extrinsic carbon stars on the other hand, are formed in binary systems by mass transfer of carbon rich material from a former AGB star (now a white dwarf) onto the secondary star. Prototype of these class are the CH stars. A zoo of carbon-rich type stars exists, all being tracers of intermediate-age stellar populations. These stars are extremely useful for studies of the star formation history and chemical evolution of the galaxies. We present the detection and chemical analysis of carbon-enriched stars so far discovered within the Gaia-ESO survey. C-enriched candidates are identified from the analysis of a series of enhanced molecular features, measured through photometric and narrow-band spectroscopic filters. Then, the stellar parameters, C/O ratios and s-process element abundances are determined. The nature (intrinsic or extrinsic) of these carbon-enriched stars is discussed together with the expected impact of the Gaia mission on the knowledge of these objects in the Milky Way.

J	Evans, K. A.; Powell, R.					Evans, Katy/0000-0001-5144-4507			The effect of subduction on the sulphur, carbon and redox budget of lithospheric mantle								JOURNAL OF METAMORPHIC GEOLOGY				33	6			649	670		10.1111/jmg.12140				AUG 2015	2015	Subduction of hydrated lithospheric mantle introduces H2O, ferric iron, oxidized carbon and sulphur to the subduction zone system. The fate of these components is poorly known, but is intimately linked to the global geochemical cycles of iron, carbon and sulphur, the genesis of arc-related ore deposits, the temporal evolution of mantle redox state and subduction-related earthquakes and magmatism. thermocalc is used to provide first-order constraints on the effect of subduction zone metamorphism on metamorphic redistribution of iron, carbon, sulphur and water in ultramafic rocks via construction of P-T and T-X(O) pseudosections with open system calculation of the effect of fluid loss. The calculations replicate observed mineral assemblages in high-P to low-T ultramafic rocks at P-T conditions consistent with those suggested by other workers. The results are consistent with open system fluid loss without significant fluid infiltration. Water loss is complete by 850 degrees C, the corresponding depth of fluid loss being consistent with that inferred for earthquakes in subducting slabs. Losses of carbon and sulphur are relatively minor, at around <5% and <1%, respectively, so it is envisaged that most carbon and sulphur subducted in ultramafic lithologies is transported to >5GPa, below the depths of the source zone for arc volcanoes. Oxygen activity for rocks in closed systems that evolve with a fixed redox budget is calculated to change from FMQ -1 at 350 degrees C to over FMQ +3 at 850 degrees C. This result emphasizes the need to consider redox budget as well as oxygen activity when the results of experiments performed at fixed oxygen activity relative to some buffer are interpreted in the context of natural systems. In open systems, devolatilization is calculated to increase the redox budget and oxygen activity of the residue via loss of methane and H2S at the brucite-out and serpentine-out reactions respectively. No fluid-induced mechanism for oxidation of sub-arc mantle by transfer of redox budget from hydrated ultramafic lithologies to the overlying sub-arc mantle was identified, although further thermodynamic data on fluid species such as are required to confirm this.									42	2	1	0	6	0	44			0263-4929	1525-1314		WOS:000357487300006

The benzene degradation rate was 1.65 mM benzene per day, which is similar to reported aerobic benzene degradation rates but 20-1650 times higher than reported for anaerobic benzene degradation. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of part of the 16S rRNA gene, cloning and sequencing showed that the culture had a stable composition after the seventh transfer. Five bacterial clones were further analyzed. Two clones corresponded to bacteria closely related to Alicycliphilus denitrificans K601. The three other clones corresponded to bacteria closely related to Zoogloea resiniphila PIV-3A2w, Mesorhizobium sp. WG and Stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila. DGGE analysis of cultures grown with different electron donors and acceptors indicated that the bacterium related to Alicycliphilus denitrificans K601 is able to degrade benzene coupled to chlorate reduction. The role of the other bacteria could not be conclusively determined. The bacterium related to Mesorhizobium sp. WG can be enriched with benzene and oxygen, but not with acetate and chlorate, while the bacterium related to Stenotrophomonas acidaminophila grows with acetate and chlorate, but not with benzene and oxygen. As oxygen is produced during chlorate reduction, an aerobic pathway of benzene degradation is most likely.									42	3	0	0	39	0	44			0168-6496	1574-6941		WOS:000245674600012	17386037

The mechanisms of oxygen reduction and evolution play a key role in understanding and controlling these batteries. With intensive efforts from many prominent research groups, it becomes clear that the instability of superoxide in the presence of Li ions (Li+) and Na ions (Na+) is the fundamental root cause for the poor stability, reversibility, and energy efficiency in aprotic Li-O-2 and Na-O-2 batteries. Stabilizing superoxide with large K ions (K+) provides a simple but elegant solution. Superoxide-based K-O-2 batteries, invented in 2013, adopt the one-electron redox process of O-2/potassium superoxide (KO2). Despite being the youngest metal-O-2 technology, K-O-2 is the most promising rechargeable metal-air battery with the combined advantages of low costs, high energy efficiencies, abundant elements, and good energy densities. However, the development of the K-O-2 battery has been overshadowed by Li-O-2 and Na-O-2 batteries because one might think K-O-2 is just an analogous extension. Moreover, due to the lower specific energy and the high reactivity of K metal, KO2 is often underestimated and deemed unsuitable for practical applications. The objective of this Perspective is to highlight the unique advantages of K-O-2 chemistry and to clarify the misconceptions prompted by the name "superoxide" and the judgment bias based on the claimed theoretical specific energies. We will also discuss the current challenges and our perspectives on how to overcome them.									31	1	0	0	0	0	30			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000550639000002	32520559

The oxygen groups were introduced onto the nanotube surface through two strong acid purification routes: (1) reflux in concentrated (70%) HNO3 acid for 4 h at 80 degrees C and (2) ultrasonification in 3 HNO3 (70%): 1H(2)SO(4) (98%) for 8.5 h. Raman spectroscopy, using two laser excitation wavelengths (514.5 and 632.8 nm), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermal gravimetric analysis were employed to study the evolution of the products. All the techniques revealed a higher degree of functionalization for scheme 2 compared to scheme 1. Charge transfer phenomena were manifested by a shift of the C Is core level towards higher binding energies. We found that the intensity of both the D and G energy Raman modes if normalized to the second order mode D* mode follows similar trends upon acid treatments. We interpret this result together with the observed dispersion of G mode as an indication that the G mode in carbon nanotubes is defect induced in a double resonant process. Both acid schemes cause an upshift of D and G Raman modes, due to intercalation of acid molecules, exerting pressure on the sp(2) structure and an electron transfer from the pi w states in MWNTs to the oxygen atoms.

Nevertheless, it still lacks of the systematically research on sintering temperature dependent electrical behaviors of bismuth titanate ceramics, and more importantly, to date there is no report on lattice distortion and domain evolution at different sintering temperatures for the ceramics as well, substantially bad for deep understanding the ceramics and limiting its further applications. Here, a type of bismuth titanate based ceramics (Bi3.96Ce0.04Ti2.97W0.015Nb0.015O12, abbreviated as BCTWN) was prepared by traditional solid-phase reaction technology, and the effects of sintering temperature on the multiple microstructures and electrical properties for BCTWN ceramics were investigated in details. The results show that oxygen octahedral rotation primarily determines the lattice distortion of pseudo-perovskite layer, and domain structures are composed of 90 degrees and 180 degrees domains. The higher sintering temperature generates more distorted crystal structure and induces larger domain size and fewer domain wall density. The grain features and defect dipole distribution are also significantly affected by sintering temperature, thus yielding the distinct electrical behaviors. This research sheds insight in micro-mechanism of optimizing electrical properties, and contributes to expanding more applications for bismuth titanate ferroelectrics. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Enormous advances in the understanding of the underlying structures and mechanisms delivered blueprints for reproducing and improving the process in artificial systems. Evolution has succeeded in developing and optimizing highly efficient enzymes which perform demanding multielectron catalytic reactions with a selectivity and stereospecificity unreached by synthetic devices. In addition, the metals employed at the catalytic sites of these enzymes are abundant and cheap. Sure, the overwhelming complexity found in the biological realm appears discouraging for the engineer who engages in a biomimetic approach. However, a large part of this complexity is related to the very specific conditions and procedures of biosynthesis and regulation of these machineries in the environment of a living cell. The basic supposition of bioinspired approaches is that certain structural and functional key features recognized as crucial in the biological systems can be successfully implemented in simpler and much more robust artificial constructs, tailored to the specific requirements of a targeted technological application. Here we present representative examples of the ongoing efforts in the development of bioinspired, supramolecular complexes for production of solar fuels and discuss the main bottlenecks and problems to be solved before their application.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0065-2296	2162-5948	978-0-12-803325-8; 978-0-12-803289-3	WOS:000382400100004

However, most of these strategies require redox mediators. Herein, a direct Z-scheme photoelectrocatalytic electrode based on a WO3-x nanowire-bridged TiO2 nanorod array heterojunction is constructed for overall water splitting, producing H-2. The as-prepared WO3-x/TiO2 nanorod array heterojunction shows photoelectrochemical (PEC) overall water splitting activity evolving both H-2 and O-2 under UV-vis light irradiation. An optimum PEC activity was achieved over a 1.67-WO3-x/TiO2 photoelectrode yielding maximum H-2 and O-2 evolution rates roughly 11 times higher than that of pure TiO2 nanorods without any sacrificial agent or redox mediator. The role of oxygen vacancy in WO3-x in affecting the H-2 production rate was also comprehensively studied. The superior PEC activity of the WO3-x/TiO2 electrode for overall water splitting can be ascribed to an efficient Z-scheme charge transfer pathway between the WO3-x nanowires and TiO2 nanorods, the presence of oxygen vacancies in WO3-x, and a bias potential applied on the photoelectrode, resulting in effective spatial charge separation. This study provides a novel strategy for developing highly efficient PECs for overall water splitting. (C) 2020 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

At present, the adopted methods for graphene synthesis cover micromechanical exfoliation, epitaxial growth, chemical reduction of graphite oxide, chemical vapor deposition, and liquid-phase exfoliation. Nonetheless, a number of issues and challenges still existed in these employed methods in terms of sustainable and green energy chemistry and environmental friendliness. Electrochemical exfoliation is one of the most promising methods for the large-scale production of graphene by virtue of simple/eco-friendly operation and high-efficiency production. Depending on different exfoliation methods (anodic, cathodic, and dual-electrode) and electrochemical exfoliation conditions such as the reaction device, raw material, electrolyte, and power-supply mode, the exfoliated graphene features various and versatile characteristics. The relatively perfect graphene with intrinsic long-range pi-conjugated character is accompanied by the fast capability of electron transfer. The defective graphene features the adjustable size and defect density and tunable amphipathicity. As a result, the corresponding graphene has been employed in energy storage/conversion, biology, and medicine fields. In this Account, we summarize the recent progress in the fundamentals of electrochemical exfoliation to produce the graphene and the derivative exfoliation method and their applications in energy-related fields, and the corresponding perspectives are also highlighted. First, we describe the fundamentals for different exfoliation methods and electricfield-induced effects that can help to guide us to prepare and produce graphene with various properties, covering the size, defect density, and surface chemistry. Subsequently, three electric-field-triggered methods (anodic, cathodic, and dual-electrode exfoliation) are discussed in detail. In particular, the effects of various electrolytes and power-supply modes on electrochemically exfoliated graphene (EEG) are systematically underlined in terms of the exfoliation principles and process, which are the significant factors affecting the structure and properties of EEG and the efficiency of intercalation and exfoliation. In addition, the recent progress in multilevel applications of EEG in energy storage/conversion fields such as supercapacitors, secondary batteries, the oxygen evolution reaction, the hydrogen evolution reaction, the carbon dioxide reduction reaction, and so forth is also summarized. Finally, the expectations and future research directions for the EEG in terms of controllably technological parameters and conditions, precise monitoring and in-depth comprehension of the exfoliation processes, multiscale and diverse products (carbon quantum dots, graphene quantum dots, and single-atom catalysts), and large-scale preparation and application are discussed, which hope to provide significant guidance for future research.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2643-6728		WOS:000741123100001

Energy Combust. Sci. 2004, 30, 329-366). Furthermore, the detailed evolution of different combustion regimes under the nonadiabatic condition has been comprehensively examined. Results show that there exists a critical X-O2 (X-O2*), below which MILD combustion can be established unconditionally as long as T-in exceeds the self-ignition point (T-in) and beyond which T-in needs to be remarkably promoted to fulfill the mathematical criteria of MILD combustion. Thus, the two regions are termed unconditional MILD combustion (UMC) and conditional MILD combustion (CMC), respectively. For the adiabatic condition, X-O2* is calculated to be 9.7%, indicating that MILD combustion will be more easily achieved with an oxygen-diluted oxidizer than the oxygen-enriched counterpart. Interestingly, X-O2* is found to climb as the heat loss ratio (HLR) increases, suggesting that enhancing the HLR of the WSR would help expand the UMC region, namely, more readily establishing MILD combustion. In addition, high-temperature combustion (HTC) can shift to CMC or even UMC by just enlarging HLR, providing a potential solution to realize MILD combustion in practical applications. However, the combustion regime would further shift to unsteady combustion (USC) or even no reaction (NR) regions once the heat is overextracted. Hence, it would be a challenge for MILD combustion application in intense heat extraction scenarios, such as boilers. Interestingly, higher T-in and lower X-O2 are found able to widen the UMC region under larger HLR conditions. Moreover, CO2 or H2O dilution would result in a wider UMC region compared to N-2 dilution, while it is more pronounced for CO2 due to its highest X-O2*. Besides, the shifting of the combustion regime from HTC to MILD combustion by heat extraction would be more effective with CO2 dilution than either N-2 or H2O dilution.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000518215400130

To achieve such goals, new advanced materials are urgently required. Atomically dispersed materials (ADMs) with single-atom metals supported on substrates feature uniform metallic sites and represent the utmost utilization of atoms, demonstrating wide applications in catalysis. These structural and morphological characteristics also make ADMs attractive materials for rechargeable batteries. Herein, we highlight and summarize the recent advances in synthetic methods for ADMs by physical confinement and chemical bonding. Subsequently, we summarize the recent progress in the design of diverse ADMs for lithium metal, lithium-sulfur, sodium-sulfur, lithium-oxygen, and zinc-air batteries and unveil the corresponding roles of ADMs from atomistic perspectives. Finally, the challenges and perspectives in this field are discussed.									15	2	0	0	2	0	15			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000572165000002		
J	Helling, Ch; Tootill, D.; Woitke, P.; Lee, E.								Dust in brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets V. Cloud formation in carbon- and oxygen-rich environments								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				603						A123	10.1051/0004-6361/201629696				JUL 20 2017	2017	Context. Recent observations indicate potentially carbon-rich (C/O > 1) exoplanet atmospheres. Spectral fitting methods for brown dwarfs and exoplanets have invoked the C/O ratio as additional parameter but carbon-rich cloud formation modeling is a challenge for the models applied. The determination of the habitable zone for exoplanets requires the treatment of cloud formation in chemically different regimes.Aims. We aim to model cloud formation processes for carbon-rich exoplanetary atmospheres. Disk models show that carbon-rich or near-carbon-rich niches may emerge and cool carbon planets may trace these particular stages of planetary evolution.Methods. We extended our kinetic cloud formation model by including carbon seed formation and the formation of C[s], TiC[s], SiC[s], KCl[s], and MgS[s] by gas-surface reactions. We solved a system of dust moment equations and element conservation for a prescribed DRIFT-PHOENIX atmosphere structure to study how a cloud structure would change with changing initial C/O-0 = 0.43 ... 10.0.Results. The seed formation efficiency is lower in carbon-rich atmospheres than in oxygen-rich gases because carbon is a very effective growth species. The consequence is that fewer particles make up a cloud if C/O-0 > 1. The cloud particles are smaller in size than in an oxygen-rich atmosphere. An increasing initial C/O ratio does not revert this trend because a much greater abundance of condensible gas species exists in a carbon-rich environment. Cloud particles are generally made of a mix of materials: carbon dominates if C/O-0 > 1 and silicates dominate if C/O-0 < 1. A carbon content of 80-90% carbon is reached only in extreme cases where C/O-0 = 3.0 or 10.0.Conclusions. Carbon-rich atmospheres form clouds that are made of particles of height-dependent mixed compositions, sizes and numbers. The remaining gas phase is far less depleted than in an oxygen-rich atmosphere. Typical tracer molecules are HCN and C2H2 in combination with a featureless, smooth continuum due to a carbonaceous cloud cover, unless the cloud particles become crystalline.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000750398100001

There is still, however, some way to go before this concept will be fully competitive. At the heart of the problem is finding and designing materials that can drive the photoreaction in an efficient and stable way. In this work we demonstrate how CIGS (CuInxGa1-xSe2), can be used for photo reduction of water into hydrogen. CIGS, which is a proven good solar cell material, does not in itself have the appropriate energetics to drive the reaction to any larger extent. Here we show that by utilizing a solid state pn-junction for charge separation and a catalyst deposited on the surface, the efficiency is significantly improved and photocurrents of 6 mA/cm(2) are demonstrated for the reduction reaction in the configuration of a photo-electrochemical cell. The stability of CIGS in water under illumination turns out to be a problem. In our present set-up, we demonstrate that separation between the charge carrier generation, which takes place in the solar cell, from the catalysis, which takes place in the electrolyte leads to improved stability, while keeping the essential functions of the processes. By incorporating appropriate charge separation layers and optimizing the catalytic conditions at the surface of the electrodes, photocurrents in excess of 20 mA/cm2 are reached for the reduction half reaction, demonstrating how essentially the full potential of GIGS as an efficient absorber material can be utilized in photocatalytic reduction of water into hydrogen.

J	Lai, Jiawei; Klein, Markus; Chakraborty, Nilanjan								Direct Numerical Simulation of Head-On Quenching of Statistically Planar Turbulent Premixed Methane-Air Flames Using a Detailed Chemical Mechanism								FLOW TURBULENCE AND COMBUSTION				101	4	SI		1073	1091		10.1007/s10494-018-9907-5				DEC 2018	2018	A three-dimensional compressible Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) analysis has been carried out for head-on quenching of a statistically planar stoichiometric methane-air flame by an isothermal inert wall. A multi-step chemical mechanism for methane-air combustion is used for the purpose of detailed chemistry DNS. For head-on quenching of stoichiometric methane-air flames, the mass fractions of major reactant species such as methane and oxygen tend to vanish at the wall during flame quenching. The absence of OH at the wall gives rise to accumulation of carbon monoxide during flame quenching because CO cannot be oxidised anymore. Furthermore, it has been found that low-temperature reactions give rise to accumulation of HO2 and H2O2 at the wall during flame quenching. Moreover, these low temperature reactions are responsible for non-zero heat release rate at the wall during flame-wall interaction. In order to perform an in-depth comparison between simple and detailed chemistry DNS results, a corresponding simulation has been carried out for the same turbulence parameters for a representative single-step Arrhenius type irreversible chemical mechanism. In the corresponding simple chemistry simulation, heat release rate vanishes once the flame reaches a threshold distance from the wall. The distributions of reaction progress variable c and non-dimensional temperature T are found to be identical to each other away from the wall for the simple chemistry simulation but this equality does not hold during head-on quenching. The inequality between c (defined based on CH4 mass fraction) and T holds both away from and close to the wall for the detailed chemistry simulation but it becomes particularly prominent in the near-wall region. The temporal evolutions of wall heat flux and wall Peclet number (i.e. normalised wall-normal distance of T=0.9 isosurface) for both simple and detailed chemistry laminar and turbulent cases have been found to be qualitatively similar. However, small differences have been observed in the numerical values of the maximum normalised wall heat flux magnitude and the minimum Peclet number (Pemin)L obtained from simple and detailed chemistry based laminar head-on quenching calculations. Detailed explanations have been provided for the observed differences in behaviours of and (Pemin)L. The usual Flame Surface Density (FSD) and scalar dissipation rate (SDR) based reaction rate closures do not adequately predict the mean reaction rate of reaction progress variable in the near-wall region for both simple and detailed chemistry simulations. It has been found that recently proposed FSD and SDR based reaction rate closures based on a-priori DNS analysis of simple chemistry data perform satisfactorily also for the detailed chemistry case both away from and close to the wall without any adjustment to the model parameters.					10th Mediterranean Combustion Symposium (MCS)10th Mediterranean Combustion Symposium (MCS)	SEP 17-21, 2017SEP 17-21, 2017	Combust Inst; Int Ctr Heat & Mass TransferCombust Inst; Int Ctr Heat & Mass Transfer	Naples, ITALYNaples, ITALY	21	0	0	0	0	0	21			1386-6184	1573-1987		WOS:000453838900008	30613187

Measurements of Photosystem II (PSII) and Photosystem I activity by Clark-type oxygen electrode demonstrated that electron flow is impaired primarily in PSII. The site and mechanism of UV-A induced damage within PSII was assessed by flash-induced oxygen and thermoluminescence (TL) measurements. The flash pattern of oxygen evolution showed an increased amount of the S-0 state in the dark, which indicate a direct effect of W-A in the water-oxidizing complex. TL measurements revealed the UV-A induced loss of PSII centers in which charge recombination between the S-2 state of the water oxidizing complex and the semireduced Q(A)(-) and Q(B)(-) quinone electron accepters occur. Flash-induced oscillation of the B TL band, originating from the S(2)Q(B)(-) recombination, showed a decreased amplitude after the second flash relative to that after the first one, which is consistent with a decrease in the amount of Q(B)(-) relative to Q(B) in dark adapted samples. The efficiency of UV-A light in inhibiting PSII electron transport exceeds that of visible light 45-fold on the basis of equal energy and 60-fold on the basis of equal photon number, respectively. In conclusion, our data show that UV-A radiation is highly damaging for PSII, whose electron transport is affected both at the water oxidizing complex, and the binding site of the Q(B) quinone electron acceptor in a similar way to that caused by UV-B radiation.									81	1	0	0	70	0	81			0031-8655	1751-1097		WOS:000090027600014	11045723

Cerium acetate, cerium chloride and cerium nitrate were used as cerium precursors to investigate the influence of anions on the growth process of CeO2 nanostructures. The morphology evolution of CeO2 and Ce(OH)(3) nanostructures indicates that the anions play an important role for the growth kinetics of resulting samples. Cl- and Ac- ions promoted the formation of one dementional (1D) CeO2 nanostructures such as nanowires, nanorods and nano hexagonal prisms, while the oxidizing anion NO3- facilitated the synthesis of CeO2 nanocubes. The hydrothermal reaction temperature is another key to govern the morphologies of CeO2 nanostructures. The formation process of the nanostructures was explored and the possible growth mechanism was discussed. The variety of CeO2 nanostructures represented inequable catalytic performance for CO oxidation. Because of different surface areas and structures, CeO2 nanowires revealed the best catalysis performance while that of the nanocubes is the worst. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

The qualities of the as-deposited aluminium nitride films were studied by varying the aluminium nitride nucleation layer growth temperature at 700 degrees C, 800 degrees C, 900 degrees C, 1000 degrees C and 1100 degrees C, respectively. The compressive strain inside the as-deposited aluminium nitride films, induced by the hetero-epitaxial growth on sapphire, was investigated through Raman spectroscopy by focusing on the evolution of E-2 (high) peak frequency, where almost stress-free aluminium nitride films were attained at nucleation layer growth temperature of 1100 degrees C. Then, the correlation between luminescence defect and level of foreign impurities respective to the varied nucleation layer growth temperatures were also systematically analysed through photoluminescence spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0361-5235	1543-186X		WOS:000613973600003

Effects of Mn doping on dielectric and ferroelectric properties of (Pb, Sr)TiO3 films on (111) Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS				106	9					094108	10.1063/1.3257168				NOV 1 2009	2009	A series of Mn doped Pb0.5Sr0.5TiO3 (PSMT) films with dopant concentrations from 0 to 10 mol % was fabricated on (111) Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates by chemical solution deposition. Their microstructure, ferroelectric, and dielectric properties were investigated, and Mn doping was found to have a significant influence on the properties of (Pb,Sr)TiO3 film. The improved microstructure with increased grain size, remnant polarization, dielectric permittivity and its tunability by dc electric field, and reduced coercive field and dielectric loss was observed in the Mn doped samples. A PSMT film with 0.5 mol % Mn dopants exhibits the optimum characteristics with maximal remnant polarization (2Pr=25.28 mu C/cm(2)), dielectric permittivity (1427) and tunability (74.5%, at 100 kHz), and minimal dielectric loss (0.015) at 1 kHz. The improvement was attributed to the improved microstructure, enhanced displacement of polar ions, and, most importantly, the suppression of oxygen-vacancy-induced ferroelectric domain pinning. which was well verified in terms of Rayleigh law Finally, the evolution of oxygen-vacancy concentration modulated by the Mn doping in PSMT films was discussed.

However, a larger work function of metal than that of semiconductor is indispensable to enable the injection of hot electrons from plasmonic metal to semiconductor. In this paper, we demonstrated that reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets as conductive "bridge" can breakthrough the restriction and transfer hot electrons from Ag of smaller work function to TiO2 of larger work function. In the design, both of the Ag nanocubes and TiO2 nanosheets are co-deposited on the surface of rGO nanosheets to form Ag-rGO-TiO2 structure, which was characterized by XRD, TEM, Raman and XPS spectra. On one hand, the Ag-rGO interface facilitates the transfer of hot electrons from Ag to rGO through conductor conductor contact. On the other hand, the new formed Schottky junction on the rGO-TiO2 interface further pumps the transferred electrons to the surface of TiO2 for photocatalytic reduction reaction resulted from the larger work function of rGO than that of TiO2. Enabled by this unique design, the hydrogen production activity achieved under visible light irradiation is dramatically enhanced in comparison with that of Ag-TiO2 counterpart with the direct contact between the same Ag nanocubes and TiO2 nanosheets. This work represents a step toward the rational interfacial design of plasmonic metal-semiconductor hybrid structures for broad-spectrum photocatalysis.									72	8	0	0	7	0	72			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000412957200018

Based on the theoretical descriptions of the reaction limited aggregation process (RLAP) and the diffusion limited aggregation process (DLAP), the entire aggregation process was explained by a combination of the RLAP and the DLAP. Experiments were done to test the possibility of this explanation for the dynamic aggregation processes in terms of the parameters that are used in a normal chemical conversion process. By defining the primary particle as the basic unit of the aggregates, the aggregation process was divided into the early stage when the primary particles are formed - and the stage of aggregation thereafter. Changing the combustion equivalence ratio of the premixed flat flame from 0.7 to 0.98 controlled the sizes of the primary particles. The deficiency of the oxygen in the combustion process controlled the final size of the primary particles in the aggregate. The morphological evolution of particles was well defined due to the stable condition in the flow. Titania and silica that were formed in the flame by the oxidation of TiCl4 and SiCl4 were used as the simulation materials of the aggregation process. Depending on the residence time and temperature history in the oxidation process, the aggregates were formed in various fractal dimensions. The thermophoretic sampling and image analysis techniques were used to evaluate the aggregation in the flame region. The coalescence effect on the particle morphology was estimated by using the tubular aerosol reactor.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0278-6826	1521-7388		WOS:000182564100003

RBCs have evolved to optimally serve this purpose by packing high concentrations of haemoglobin in their cytosol and shedding nuclei and other organelles. During their circulatory lifetimes in humans of approximately 120 days, RBCs are poised to transport oxygen by metabolic/redox enzymes until they accumulate damage and are promptly removed by the reticuloendothelial system. These elaborate evolutionary adaptions, however, are no longer effective when RBCs are removed from the circulation and stored hypothermically in blood banks, where they develop storage-induced damages ("storage lesions") that accumulate over the shelf life of stored RBCs. This review attempts to provide a comprehensive view of the literature on the subject of RBC storage lesions and their purported clinical consequences by incorporating the recent exponential growth in available data obtained from "omics" technologies in addition to that published in more traditional literature. To summarise this vast amount of information, the subject is organised in figures with four panels: i) root causes; ii) RBC storage lesions; iii) physiological effects; and iv) reported outcomes. The driving forces for the development of the storage lesions can be roughly classified into two root causes: i) metabolite accumulation/depletion, the target of various interventions (additive solutions) developed since the inception of blood banking; and ii) oxidative damages, which have been reported for decades but not addressed systemically until recently. Downstream physiological consequences of these storage lesions, derived mainly by in vitro studies, are described, and further potential links to clinical consequences are discussed. Interventions to postpone the onset and mitigate the extent of the storage lesion development are briefly reviewed. In addition, we briefly discuss the results from recent randomised controlled trials on the age of stored blood and clinical outcomes of transfusion.									178	4	4	0	92	0	189			1723-2007			WOS:000455107200004	30653459

The multielectron redox chemistry required for this process has been successfully deployed on a global scale in natural photosynthesis by green plants and cyanobacteria using photosystem II (PSII). PSII employs a conserved, cuboidal Mn4CaOx cluster called the O-2-evolving complex (OEC) that offers inspiration for artificial O-2-evolution catalysts.In this Account, we describe our work on manganese model chemistry relevant to PSII, particularly the functional model [Mn-2(III/IV)(terpy)(2)(mu-O)(2)(OH2)(2)](NO3)(3) complex (terpy = 2,2';6',2"-terpyridine), a mixed-valent di-mu-oxo Mn dimer with two terminal aqua ligands. In the presence of oxo-donor oxidants such as HSO5-, this complex evolves 02 by two pathways, one of which incorporates solvent water in an O-O bond-forming reaction. Deactivation pathways of this catalyst include Comproportionation to form an inactive (MnMnIV)-Mn-IV dimer and also degradation to MnO2, a consequence of ligand loss when the oxidation state of the complex is reduced to labile Mn-II upon release of O-2. The catalyst's versatility has been shown by its continued catalytic activity after direct binding to the semiconductor titanium dioxide. In addition, after binding to the surface of TiO2 via a chromophoric linker, the catalyst can be oxidized by a photoinduced electron-transfer mechanism, mimicking the natural PSII process.Model oxomanganese complexes have also aided in interpreting biophysical and computational studies on PSII. In particular, the mu-oxo exchange rates of the Mn terpy dimer have been instrumental in establishing that the time scale for mu-oxo exchange of high-valent oxomanganese complexes with terminal water ligands is slower than O-2 evolution in the natural photosynthetic system. Furthermore, computational studies on the Mn terpy dimer and the OEC point to similar Mn-IV-oxyl intermediates in the O-O bond-forming mechanism.Comparison between the OEC and the Mn terpy dimer indicates that challenges remain in the development of synthetic Mn water-oxidation catalysts. These include redox leveling to couple multielectron reactions with one-electron steps, avoiding labile Mn-II species during the catalytic cycle, and protecting the catalyst active site from undesired side reactions.As the first example of a functional manganese O-2-evolution catalyst, the Mn terpy dimer exemplifies the interrelatedness of biomimetic chemistry with biophysical studies. The design of functional model complexes enriches the study of the natural photosynthetic system, while biology continues to provide inspiration for artificial photosynthetic technologies to meet global energy demand.									110	2	0	0	15	0	110			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000351326900009	25730258

Until recently, the application of EPR spectroscopy to the characterization of the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) has been limited to the S-2-state of the Kok cycle. However, in the past few years, continuous wave-EPR signals have been obtained for both the S-0- and S-1-state as well as for the S-2-Y-Z(.)-state of a number of inhibited systems. Furthermore, the pulsed EPR technique of electron spin echo electron nuclear double resonance spectroscopy has been used to directly probe the Mn-55 nuclei of the manganese cluster. In this review, we discuss how the EPR data obtained from each of these states of the OEC Kok cycle are being used to provide insight into the physical and electronic structure of the manganese cluster and its interaction with the key tyrosine, Y-Z.

The use of industry-derived alkaline wastes as feedstocks for mineral carbonation also provides an opportunity for waste valorisation. In this review, we describe the carbonation of steel slag, a calcium-rich solid waste from iron and steel industries, whose current utilisation is below par in major crude steel-producing countries. We review ex situ mineral carbonation routes, both direct and indirect, which produce weathered aggregates suitable for the construction industry and value-added chemicals such as precipitated calcium carbonate, respectively. We present an in-depth analysis of slag characteristics and its implications for dissolution and carbonation mechanisms. Current research efforts are focused on overcoming slow carbonation kinetics under atmospheric conditions. However, a good understanding of the rate limiting step and the role of product layers in reaction kinetics is incomplete and evolving. In this review, we summarize the experimental research efforts in understanding the rate limiting step and enhancement strategies for various process routes proposed in the literature. Steel slags are chemically heterogeneous residues and pose significant challenges in modelling the dissolution kinetics. To determine the controlling mechanism using models, it is necessary to model the competitive behaviour of ions during dissolution and precipitation, temporal evolution of the reactive surface area, and coupling of the surface reaction and mass transport at the fluid-solid interface. We present mathematical models that describe the surface reaction, role of polydispersity and heterogeneous morphology in determining reactive surface area evolution, and briefly inform the readers about the non-equilibrium thermodynamics approach for modelling coupled processes. Finally, the current state-of-art in reactor technologies and a step forward for commercialisation are commented on.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			2058-9883			WOS:000661974300001

Bimetallic nanoparticles of NiFe and NiCo were fabricated by co-precipitation and thermal reduction by oleylamine. The process of co-precipitation involves NaOH as a precipitation agent to precipitate the metal-based nitrates, while thermal reduction process involves the synthesis of metal-containing compounds using oleylamine, which act as reducing agent, surfactant, and solvent. Different synthesis conditions in terms of composition were studied. Structural characterization of nanoparticles was carried out using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and BET surface area. Electrochemical behavior of nanoparticles was investigated using rotating disk electrode. The electrochemical characterization studied the effect of catalyst composition on the electrochemical behavior of the catalyst.					233rd Meeting of The-Electrochemical-Society (ECS)233rd Meeting of The-Electrochemical-Society (ECS)	MAY 13-17, 2018MAY 13-17, 2018	Electrochem SocElectrochem Soc	Seattle, WASeattle, WA	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1938-5862	1938-6737	978-1-60768-841-9	WOS:000541678600087

These manganese porphyrins promote NO disproportionation to NO2 species and N2O, and the reaction proceeds via several distinct stages. At 90 K, the principal species observed spectrally are the nitric oxide dimer, cis-ONNO, two manganese nitrosyls, the simple NO adduct Mn( Por)(NO), and another intermediate (1) that is apparently critical to the disproportionation mechanism. This key intermediate is formed prior to N2O evolution, and proposals regarding its likely structure are offered. When the system is warmed to 130 K, the disproportionation products, N2O and the O-coordinated nitrito complex Mn( Por)(NO)(ONO) ( 2), are formed. IR spectral changes show that, upon further warming to 200 K, 2 isomerizes into the N-bonded nitro linkage isomer Mn(Por)(NO)(NO2) ( 3). After it is warmed to room temperature, the latter species loses NO and converts to the known 5-coordinate nitrito complex Mn(Por)(ONO) (4).									31	4	0	0	3	0	32			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000237593100037	16676969

This is demonstrated herein by comparing crystalline oxides consisting of Mn3+ (manganite, gamma-MnOOH; bixbyite, Mn2O3), Mn4+ (pyrolusite, beta-MnO2) and multiple monophasic mixed-valence manganese oxides. Like all Mn4+ oxides, pure beta-MnO2 has no detectable catalytic activity, while gamma-MnOOH (tetragonally distorted Mn3+O6, D-4h symmetry) is significantly more active and Mn2O3 (trigonal antiprismatic Mn3+O6, D-3d symmetry) is the most active. gamma-MnOOH deactivates during catalytic turnover simultaneous with the disappearance of crystallographically defined corner-sharing Mn3+O6 and the appearance of Mn4+. In a comparison of 2D-layered crystalline birnessites (delta-MnO2), the monovalent Mn4+ form is catalytically inert, while the hexagonal polymorph, containing few out-of-layer corner-sharing Mn3+O6, has similar to 10-fold higher catalytic activity than the triclinic polymorph, containing in-plane edge-sharing Mn3+O6. These electronic and structural correlations point toward the more flexible (corner-shared) Mn3+O6 sites, over more rigid (edge-shared) sites as substantially more active catalytic centers. Electrochemical measurements show and ligand field theory predicts that, among corner-shared Mn3+O6 sites, those possessing D-3d ligand field symmetry have stronger covalent Mn-O bonding to the six equivalent oxygen ligands, which we ascribe as responsible for more efficient and faster electrolytic water oxidation. In contrast, D-4h, Mn3+O6 sites have weaker Mn-O bonding to the two axial oxygen ligands, have separated electrochemical oxidation waves for Mn and O, and are catalytically less efficient and exhibit slower catalytic turnover. By controlling the ligand field geometry and strength to oxygen ligands, we have identified the key variables for tuning water oxidation activity by manganese oxides. We apply these findings to propose a mechanism for water oxidation by the CaMn4O5 catalytic site of natural photosynthesis.									120	6	0	0	9	0	120			2155-5435			WOS:000371755500080

Reaction in argon, Ar-10 vol% N-2 and nitrogen atmospheres was performed in the temperature range 1300-1800 degreesC with an isothermal treatment time of 0.5 h. The kinetics of the reaction was studied in an Ar-10 vol% N-2 atmosphere at 1250 and 1350 degreesC with isothermal treatment times ranging from 0.5 to 16 h. The solid reaction products obtained in these investigations were characterized by X-ray diffraction, chemical nonmetal analysis, SEM and physical adsorption.The results confirm the validity of the reaction mechanism consisting of two interconnected solid-gas reactions (oxide with CO and carbon with CO2) and three reaction steps for the case of presence of nitrogen in the atmosphere at atmospheric pressure, leading to the formation of oxycarbonitrides and carbonitrides, with the oxide particles as the precursors. Due to its instability in nitrogen-containing atmospheres, Ti2O3 does not appear as an intermediate reaction product if nitrogen is present. Other factors leading to its appearance in noble gas atmospheres have not been determined, but a carbon deficiency in the starting mixture relative to a stoichiometric mixture for the formation of TiC can safely be excluded. Nitrogen is probably not incorporated into the oxide intermediate products; however, this is difficult to demonstrate experimentally. Nitrogen is incorporated into the solid phase as cubic TiCxOyNz is formed, its content depending on its partial pressure. At the same time, an increase in nitrogen content above 10% seems to have no effect on the oxygen content of the cubic phase. Despite their different structures, furnace black and graphite do not show clear differences with respect to their reaction kinetics. The composition and particle size of the oxycarbonitride obtained in identical reaction conditions are nearly independent of the type of carbon used. The change in the specific surface area with progressing reaction mainly results from the regeneration Of CO2 to CO, which proceeds primarily on the external surface of the carbon particles for the reaction conditions investigated in this work.

J	Cano, A E; Meaney, E								[Pulmonary complications of acute myocardial infarct. Therapeutic orientation].				Las complicaciones pulmonares del infarto agudo del miocardio. Orientaciones terapeuticas				Archivos del Instituto de Cardiologia de Mexico				45	3			344	56						1975 May-Jun	1975	The heart and the lung make up an inseparable anatomic and functional unit. The changes in one affect the other and vice versa. In acute myocardial infarction a heart failure syndrome develops. This syndrome is characterized by passive pulmonary congestion, which leads to hypoxemia. This hypoxemia indicate the functional disturbance of the lung, and the hemodinamic evolution of the disease. Arterial gases determination is the best way to assess the sickness progression. A certain paralelism exists among the central venous saturation, cardiac insufficiency and the degree of pulmonary disfunction. Such a procedure is not very appreciable and does not substitute the direct analysis of the arterial PO2. The pulmonary complications in the myocardial infarction shock are directly responsable of death in 50% of the patients. To heart failure and shock, hipperfusion and hypoxia are added. Many vessels close due to the decrease in the pulmonary flow. This brings about the release of substances that are toxic to the vessel causing an inflammatory vascular reaction. The decrease in the flow harms the lung cell and for this reason atelectasia or alveolar colapse occur; besides inducing the formation of shunts. Under these conditions the lung compliance decreases. The areas that are badly ventilated and hypoperfused can easily become infected and pneumonitis and abscesses cause even more harm to the tissue. The decrease in the speed of circulation and hematologic changes of shock, induce a diseminated intravascular coagulation. What was stated before leads to an important reduction of the lung as a depurating organ and makes the shock irreversible. As far as therapy is concerned in the prevention of vascular colaps and the improvement of the oxemia, oxygen is very useful when there is a venous congestion (clinically, X rays, and oxemia). When the concentration of O2 is lower than 50% in the cases with slight cardiac failure; do not use oxygen in higher concentrations unless the hypoxia is associated to acute pulmonary edema and shock. Mechanic ventilators, and intermitent possitive pressure are recommended even though they have a posenous effect on the cardiac output. Always keep the air ways permeable: changing position, breathing exercises, humidifications, aspiration of secretions, intubation, or traqueostomy depending upon the various cases.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-3785			MEDLINE:1156008	1156008

This challenge is confronted through an innovative approach of in-operando gas switching. Here, we developed a novel double perovskite electrode Sr2ScTi1-xMoxO6; x = 0.1 and 0.5, for the symmetrical solid oxide fuel cell. The crystallite phase and chemical stability of the perovskite are examined by X-ray diffraction whole powder pattern fitting. The electrochemical impedance analysis confirmed that the electrodes are exhibiting significant catalytic activity for hydrogen and methane oxidation, as well as the reduction of oxygen. Evolution of the cubic ScTiO3 due to the topotactic oxidation, improve the oxygen reduction activity of Sr2ScTi0.9Mo0.1O6, whereas the in-situ exsolution of Ti-ions enables the Sr2ScTi0.9Mo0.1O6 to exhibits of higher catalytic activity for fuel oxidation. The electrochemical performance, stability, and the effect of in-operando gas switching are investigated on large area (5 x 5 cm(2)) symmetrical solid oxide fuel cells supplying humidified CH4 and air. The galvanostatic test concludes the in-operando switching suppress the performance degradation of the SSOFC completely.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000582482700013

Synthesis and alignment of Zn and ZnO nanoparticles by laser-assisted chemical vapor deposition								NANOTECHNOLOGY				19	4					045609	10.1088/0957-4484/19/04/045609				JAN 30 2008	2008	A simple, versatile, and fast laser-assisted chemical vapor deposition (LCVD) technique that produces linear arrays of Zn and ZnO nanoparticles on a silicon substrate, covering an extended region, is described. A series of consecutive steps is involved in the synthesis and alignment of Zn/ZnO nanoparticles. First, a Lloyd's mirror arrangement is employed to produce two types of periodic nanostructure, i.e., nanoripples and nanoprotrusions. Next, the nanostructured substrate is laser irradiated at a fluence of 60 mJ cm(-2) in the presence of the metall-organic (MO) precursor gas diethylzinc (DEZn). The evolution of the Zn nanocrystals by LCVD processing was studied as a function of precursor gas pressure and laser fluence by ex situ high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Laser irradiation fulfills a double role: it decomposes the adsorbed precursor and causes the evolution of resulting Zn into aligned aggregates of zinc nanoparticles. The Zn nanoparticles react with oxygen upon high-temperature thermal annealing to yield aligned assemblies of ZnO nanoparticles. The production of ZnO was confirmed by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and photoluminescence spectra. This technique is general and could be used in a large number of substrate/precursor combinations.									24	0	0	0	3	0	25			0957-4484			WOS:000252967000021	21817515

Methods DNA was isolated from whole blood in subjects from the HERITAGE Family Study that were determined to be either HR (n= 15) or LR (n= 15). mtDNA was amplified by long-range polymerase chain reaction, then tagged with Nextera libraries and sequenced on a MiSeq instrument. Results Different mtDNA haplogroup subtypes were found in HR and LR individuals. Compared with HR subjects, significantly more LR subjects had variants in 13 sites, including 7 in hypervariable (HV) regions: HV2 (G185A: 0 vs 6,P= 0.02; G228A: 0 vs 5,P= 0.04; C295T: 0 vs 6;P= 0.04), HV3 (C462T: 0 vs 5,P= 0.04; T489C: 0 vs 5;P= 0.04), and HV1 (C16068T: 0 vs 6,P= 0.02; T16125C: 0 vs 6,P= 0.02). Remaining variants were in protein coding genes,mtND1(1 vs 8,P= 0.02),mtND3(A10397G: 0 vs 5,P= 0.04),mtND4(A11250G: 1 vs 8,P= 0.02),mtND5(G13707A: 0 vs 5,P= 0.04), andmtCYTB(T14797C: 0 vs 5,P= 0.04; C15451A: 1 vs 8,P= 0.02). Average total numbers of heteroplasmies (P= 0.83) and frequency of heteroplasmies (P= 0.05) were similar between the groups. Conclusions Our findings provide specific sites across the mitochondrial genome that may be related to maximal oxygen uptake trainability.									9	0	0	0	6	1	9			0195-9131	1530-0315		WOS:000577715400004	33064405

J	Zeng, Xiangming; Pan, Peng; Qi, Hao; He, Zuming; Su, Jiangbin								Preparation of copper nanowires and thermal oxidation behaviour in dry oxygen								SURFACE INNOVATIONS				10	3			200	208		10.1680/jsuin.21.00033				OCT 12 2021	2021	Copper (Cu) nanowires are a promising functional and structural material in electronics, optoelectronic devices and integrated circuits. The preparation and thermal stability of Cu nanowires are crucial for the functional realisation and performance stability of related devices. In this work, the authors particularly prepared Cu nanowires by a two-step approach and further studied the thermal oxidation behaviour of Cu nanowires in dry oxygen. It was found that the as-prepared Cu nanowires have a good (111)-oriented single crystal structure with a smooth and clean surface. With the increase of annealing temperature and time, the Cu nanowires were oxidised gradually in dry oxygen and the crystal phase of Cu nanowires underwent the evolution of Cu (111)Cu2O (111)CuO (-111)+(111). Furthermore, when the temperature was not higher than 400 degrees C, the as-formed Cu2O and CuO layers or nanowires were slightly crystallised or nearly amorphous. However, when the temperature was higher than 400 degrees C, the as-formed CuO nanowires were greatly crystallised. It was further observed that the oxidation of Cu nanowires arose from the wire surface and formed a non-dense, nearly amorphous layer of Cu2O nanoparticles therein. Such Cu2O layer on the surface of Cu nanowires greatly reduces optical transmittance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-6252	2050-6260		WOS:000798288100002

J	Pei, Zhihao; Xu, Li; Xu, Wei								Hierarchical honeycomb-like Co3O4 pores coating on CoMoO4 nanosheets as bifunctional efficient electrocatalysts for overall water splitting								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				433				256	263		10.1016/j.apsusc.2017.09.248				MAR 1 2018	2018	Efficient electrocatalytic water splitting is one of the most effective ways to solve the global energy crisis. In this paper, we report on a novel self-assembled hierarchical structure of Co3O4/CoMoO4 grown in situ on a bare nickel foam. The unique, three-dimensional honeycomb-like Co3O4 pores were constructed from one-dimensional nanowires and coated on two-dimensional CoMoO4 nanosheets structures grown on nickel foam. The synthesis involved a step-wise solvothermal method followed by an annealing treatment. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the hierarchical nanostructures, the materials had more reaction active sites and a smaller electron transfer impedance, and they exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performances for the HER and OER of 143 and 244 mV, respectively, at 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline solution. Furthermore, the materials remained stable during the long electrolysis period, over 10 h, presenting promising application prospects in the field of electrocatalytic water splitting.

This prediction questions the origin of extremely high C-13 and N-15 abundances observed in rare presolar SiC grains which is usually attributed to classical novae. In this context the N-13(alpha, p) O-16 reaction plays an important role since it is in competition with N-13 beta(+) decay to C-13.Purpose: The N-13(alpha, p) O-16 reaction rate used in stellar evolution calculations comes from the Caughlan and Fowler compilation with very scarce information on the origin of this rate and with no associated uncertainty. The goal of this work is to provide a recommended N-13(alpha, p) O-16 reaction rate, based on available experimental data, with a meaningful statistical uncertainty.Method: Unbound nuclear states in the F-17 compound nucleus were studied using the spectroscopic information of the analog states in O-17 nucleus that were measured at the Tandem-Alto facility using the C-13(7Li, t)O-17 alpha-particle-transfer reaction. The alpha-particle spectroscopic factors were derived using a finite-range distortedwave Born approximation analysis. This spectroscopic information was used to calculate a recommended N-13(alpha, p)O-16 reaction rate with meaningful uncertainty using a Monte Carlo approach.Results: The N-13(alpha, p) O-16 reaction rate from the present work is found to be within a factor of two of the previous evaluation in the temperature range of interest, with a typical uncertainty of a factor approximate to 2-3. The source of this uncertainty has been identified to come from the three main contributing resonances at Ec.m. r = 221, 741, and 959 keV. This new error estimation translates to an overall uncertainty in the C-13 production of a factor of 50 when using the lower and upper reaction rates in the conditions relevant for the N-13(alpha, p) O-16 activation.Conclusions: The main source of uncertainty on the re-evaluated N-13(alpha, p) O-16 reaction rate currently comes from the uncertain alpha-particle width of relevant F-17 states.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2469-9985	2469-9993		WOS:000570300800002

Overall, we hope to demonstrate that combined simulation and experimental studies of film profiles and composition profiles inside features is a valuable tool in efforts to arrive at useful kinetic and transport models. In particular, conformality limitations and film composition variations inside features for films deposited at low pressures are explained using examples of studies that combine transport and reaction simulations of deposition processes and carefully designed experimental work. The technical presentation is divided into three major parts. In the first section, we demonstrate that thermal systems can be modeled without "calibrating" the transport and reaction models used, though calibration can still be useful. The process considered in this section is the thermal deposition of SiO2 from TEOS (tetraethoxysilane). We discuss the use of film profile information to decide between two kinetic models for the deposition process, then we discuss one way to integrate reactor scale and feature scale models in order to capture "microloading" due to changes in local pattern density. The second section demonstrates the state of topography simulation for plasma processes. We demonstrate the use of physically motivated models that in general require calibration from experimental data for a given set of operating conditions. As our first plasma example, we use the sputter deposition of Ti-W to demonstrate the existence of composition profiles inside features. We then use etch simulations to show how simulations can be used to test proposed chemical and/or physical phenomena. The last major section is a case study on plasma enhanced deposition of SiO2 from TEOS and oxygen (PETEOS) that demonstrates the roles of "3d/2d" and "3d/3d" (transport dimensionality/surface dimensionality) topography simulators in "virtual wafer fabs", The same methodology would apply to most topography relevant processes, including thin film flow processes.

To achieve these objectives, several experiments were carried out using in vitro matured oocytes from prepubertal goats. The main findings of this work are that: (1) in our conditions, the optimum sperm concentration is 4 x 10(6) sperm/ml, as this sperm: oocyte ratio (approximately 28,000) allowed us to obtain the highest penetration rate, without increasing polyspermy incidence; (2) the highest percentage of viable acrosome-reacted spermatozoa is observed between 8-12 h of gamete co-culture, while the penetration rate is maximum at 12 h of co-incubation; and (3) the presence of COCs seems to favour the acrosome reaction of free spermatozoa on IVF medium, but not significantly. In conclusion, we suggest that a gamete co-incubation for 12-14 h, with a concentration of 4 x 10(6) sperm/ml, would be sufficient to obtain the highest rate of penetration, reducing the exposure of oocytes to high levels of reactive oxygen species produced by spermatozoa, especially when a high sperm concentration is used to increase the caprine IVF outcome.									3	1	0	0	4	0	4			0967-1994	1469-8730		WOS:000284043800009	20334721

We focused on the southwest Arkansas shelf, a structurally simple portion of one of the interior basins of the northern Gulf Coast sedimentary basin. Here, faulting and facies changes juxtapose dominantly oolitic carbonate strata against basal evaporites, red beds, and siliciclastics, as well as metamorphosed basement rocks. Brines from this area have exceptionally high Br and alkali element concentrations and have spatially heterogeneous hydrogen sulfide concentrations. Strontium, boron, oxygen, and hydrogen isotope compositions exhibit coherent relations with other aspects of brine geochemistry. Sr isotope compositions range from those expected for carbonates and evaporites deposited from Jurassic seawater (0.7071 ) to radiogenic ratios as high as 0.7107. Generally, most radiogenic Sr isotope values are associated with H2S-rich waters which also have elevated alkali element (Li, B, K, Rb) concentrations. These alkali element-rich waters are associated with portions of the South Arkansas fault system which reach basement.Boron isotope compositions are similarly heterogeneous, ranging from values of +26 to +50 parts per thousand. Brines with highest B contents are most depleted in B-11, consistent with boron input from brines generated from high-temperature siliciclastic diagenetic reactions. Normalizing B contents to Br in the brines reveals a reasonable mixing trend between a Dead Sea-type composition and Texas Gulf Coast-type shale/sand reservoir waters.Oxygen and hydrogen isotope data exhibit regional variations which are controlled by meteoric water invasion along the northern limb of the southwest Arkansas Fault, which has surface expression. Although oxygen isotope compositions are often near equilibrium with respect to reservoir carbonate, it is more difficult to ascribe trends in deltaD values to local water-rock interaction. The stable isotope trends can be explained either in terms of an evolved marine evaporite brine or a water evolved via water-rock interaction, and mixing with meteoric water in the vicinity of the southwest Arkansas Fault. Spatial heterogeneity in isotopic composition of formation waters from this relatively restricted study area suggests that assumptions of a homogeneous Sr reservoir in dating regional mineralization events require careful assessment in ancient systems.									69	4	0	0	6	0	73			0016-7037			WOS:A1993LC55400013

We present a density functional theory study of such systems for the electrochemical reduction of CO. Theoretical investigations of CO electrochemical reduction are particularly challenging in that electrochemical activation energies are a necessary descriptor of activity. We determined the electrochemical barriers for key proton-electron transfer steps using a state-of-the-art, fully explicit solvent model of the electrochemical interface. The accuracy of GGA-level functionals in describing these systems was also benchmarked against hybrid methods. We find the first proton transfer to form CHO from CO to be a critical step in C-1 product formation. On these single atom sites, the corresponding barrier scales more favorably with the CO binding energy than for 211 and 111 transition metal surfaces, in the direction of improved activity. Intermediates and transition states for the hydrogen evolution reaction were found to be less stable than those on transition metals, suggesting a higher selectivity for CO reduction. We present a rate volcano for the production of methane from CO. We identify promising candidates with high activity, stability, and selectivity for the reduction of CO. This work highlights the potential of these systems as improved electrocatalysts over pure transition metals for CO reduction.									40	3	0	0	2	0	40			2374-7943	2374-7951		WOS:000418706200010	29296669

The porous carbon was derived from a biomass i.e., mulberry leaf through a cost-effective approach. The existence of diverse compounds containing carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur in mulberry leaf benefit the formation and uniform dispersion of Fe2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) in the porous carbon. In evaluating the effects of the carbon support on the Fe2O3 NPs towards the ORR, we found that the sample of Fe2O3/N-PCs-850 (Fe2O3/N-PCs obtained at 850 degrees C) with high surface area of 313.8 m(2).g(-1) exhibits remarkably superior ORR activity than that of materials acquired under other temperatures. To be specific, the onset potential and reduction peak potential of Fe2O3/N-PCs-850 towards ORR are 0.936 V and 0.776 V (vs. RHE), respectively. The calculated number of electron transfer n for the ORR is 3.9, demonstrating a near four-electron-transfer process. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent longtime stability and resistance to methanol deactivation compared with Pt/C catalyst. This study provides a novel design of highly active ORR electrocatalysts from low-cost abundant plant products.									13	1	1	0	0	0	13			2073-4344			WOS:000428506300008

However, the previous reports on the stabilization of such composite catalysts have shown that they deactivated severely under moist conditions. Herein, we developed an alpha-MnO2 nanorod-supported copper oxide catalyst that is very active and stable for the conditions with or without moisture by the deposition precipitation (DP) method. Incredibly, the CuO/MnO2 DP catalyst (with 5 wt % copper loading) achieves superior activity with a reaction rate of 9.472 /mu mol(-1).g(cat)(-1).s(-1) even at ambient temperatures, which is at least double times of that for the reported copper-based catalyst. Additionally, the CuO/MnO, DP catalyst is significantly more stable than the copper manganese composite catalysts reported in the literature under the presence of 3% water vapor as well as without moisture. A correlation between the catalytic CO oxidation activity and textural characteristics was derived via multitechnique analyses. The results imply that the superior activity of the CuO/MnO2 DP catalyst is associated with the proper adsorption of CO on partially reduced copper oxide as Cu(I)-CO and more surface oxygen species at the interfacial site of the catalyst.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			0743-7463			WOS:000576747600003	32787057

Aiming to lower the ash-melting temperature (AMT) for energy-saving, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction and the scanning electron microscope were used to investigate the relations between AMT and the mineral evolution. The results indicated that the change of AMT was determined by the types and the contents of mineral crystals. The transition from refractory minerals to fluxing minerals was the key. The transition of the main crystalline phase from pseudowollastonite (Ca-3(Si3O9)) to wollastonite (CaSiO3) played a significant role in AMT reduction. A quantum chemistry calculation was carried out to investigate the effect of crystal reaction activity on AMT. In the chemical reaction, the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital played a more important role than any other orbits. Cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+) were apt to enter into the crystal lattice of wollastonite and gehlenite mainly through Si (3), O (1), Si (6), O (10) and Al (2), O (10), and broke the covalent bonds of Si (3)-O (7), Al (1)-O (9) and Al (1)-O (15), respectively. This deconstruction behaviour provided convenient conditions for restructuring and promoted the formation of fluxing minerals. In melts, the excess SiO2 monomers which existed in the form of cristobalite and quartz caused AMT increase.									8	0	0	0	5	0	8			0959-3330	1479-487X		WOS:000370528000013	26506987	
J	Harvey, RP; McSween, HY								A possible high-temperature origin for the carbonates in the Martian meteorite ALH84001								NATURE				382	6586			49	51		10.1038/382049a0				JUL 4 1996	1996	THE meteorite Allan Hills (ALH) 84001, commonly accepted to be of martian origin, is unique among known martian meteorites in containing abundant, zoned, pre-terrestrial carbonate minerals(1-9). Previous studies of the oxygen isotope compositions of these minerals(5,6,8) have suggested that they precipitated from a low-temperature (0-80 degrees C) aqueous fluid in the martian crust-perhaps in a near-surface hydrothermal system, Here we report analyses of the major-element compositions of the carbonates, which provide an independent constraint on the composition and temperature of the fluid from which they formed. We argue that the most likely explanation for the observed compositions, and for the absence of co-existing hydrous minerals, is that the carbonates were formed by reactions between hot (>650 degrees C), CO2-rich fluids and the ultramafic host rock during an impact event, Impact processes on the martian surface can produce both the hot, CO2-rich fluid (by volatilization of surface carbonates or other CO2 sources) and-by brecciation-the conduits through which it flowed, Impact metasomatism is also consistent with the observed oxygen isotope disequilibrium, sequence of mineral formation, and carbonate mineral zoning, reflecting carbonate formation during rapid cooling from high temperatures rather than prolonged exposure to low-temperature fluids(6,8).									160	2	0	0	13	0	164			0028-0836			WOS:A1996UV47300048	8657303

Here, a trapping-bonding strategy is proposed to realize the superassembly of surface-enriched Ru nanoclusters on a phytic acid modified nitrogen-doped carbon framework (denoted as NCPO-Ru NCs). The modified framework has a high affinity to metal cations and can trap plenty of Ru ions. The trapped Ru ions are mainly distributed on the surface of the framework and can form Ru nanoclusters at 50 degrees C with the synergistic effect of vacancies and phosphate groups. By adjusting the content of phytic acid, surface-enriched Ru nanoclusters with adjustable distribution and densities can be obtained. Benefiting from the adequate exposure of the active sites and dense distribution of ultrasmall Ru nanoclusters, the obtained NCPO-Ru NCs catalyst can effectively drive HER in alkaline electrolytes and show an activity (at overpotential of 50 mV) about 14.3 and 9.6 times higher than that of commercial Ru/C and Pt/C catalysts, respectively.

In the present work, we prepared nanostructured MoSx with different sulfur molar concentrations (x = 2, 1, 0.5) through a one-step hydrothermal method. The decrease in sulfur concentration resulted in a new phase that is MoO3 with a Mo:S of 1:0.5. The structural, morphological, and optical properties of all the samples were studied through X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, respectively. Moreover, the electrochemical behavior was studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and Tafel slope. Optimum properties were observed for Mo:S (1:1) with an onset potential of 96 mV, an overpotential of 130 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) coupled with a specific capacitance of 889 F/g and low charge transfer resistance of 43 U. Further, it was noted that the electrocatalytic activity of MoS1 was better than that of the composite and bare MoO3. It is proposed that the excellent electrochemical activity arises from sulfur vacancies which provide active sites for HER and a free path for ions to flow through the material.

J	Liu, Chunlei; Zhang, Gong; Zhou, Wei; Zhang, Kai; Qu, Jiuhui; Liu, Huijuan								Regulating Oriented Adsorption on Targeted Nickel Sites for Antibiotic Oxidation with Simultaneous Hydrogen Energy Recovery by a Direct Electrochemical Process								ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES				13	16			18673	18682		10.1021/acsami.1c00562		APR 2021		APR 28 2021	2021	The efficiency of antibiotic oxidation by direct electrochemical processes based on transition metal electrodes is largely restricted by the adsorption capacity for single molecules on targeted active sites. Inspired by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we found that the adsorption energy of sulfanilamide molecules on Ni sites could be markedly changed by regulating the local atomic environment of the Ni atoms (for NiCo2O4 and NiCoP, Delta G(Ni) = -0.11 and +0.47 eV, respectively). The high electronegativity of oxygen changed the electron cloud density around the Ni atoms, leading to an oriented adsorption of SA on Ni sites. Moreover, the oriented adsorption on Ni sites occurs not only on NiCo2O4 but on the in situ-generated (NiOOH)-O-III (Delta G(Ni) = -0.09 eV). Consequently, utilizing NiCo2O4 as the anode resulted in superior removal performance (97% vs 55% efficiency) for SA oxidation, with a kinetic constant similar to 10 times higher than that of NiCoP (0.031 min(-1) vs 0.0029 min(-1)). Meanwhile, non-oriented adsorption reduced the competition between SA molecules and H+ for active sites, which benefitted the activity of the hydrogen evolution reaction at the NiCoP cathode (68 mV at j = 10 mA.cm(-2), 0.5 mmol.L-1 SA added in). Furthermore, the in situ Raman spectra and DFT calculations confirmed that (NiOOH)-O-III dominated the oxidation process and terminated it at the p-benzoquinone stage. These findings provide a feasible strategy to combine electrochemical antibiotic oxidation by Ni-based electrodes with hydrogen energy recovery.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000645520700026	33856754

Potentially complex interactions between chemical species do not often allow for an easy understanding of the underlying chemical mechanisms governing the atmospheric composition. In particular, trace species can affect the abundance of major species by acting in catalytic cycles. On Mars, such cycles even control the abundance of its main atmospheric constituent CO2. The identification of catalytic cycles (or more generally chemical pathways) by hand is quite demanding. Hence, the application of computer algorithms is beneficial in order to analyze complex chemical reaction networks. Here, we have performed the first automated quantified chemical pathways analysis of the Martian atmosphere with respect to CO2-production in a given reaction system. For this, we applied the Pathway Analysis Program (PAP) to output data from the Caltech/JPL photochemical Mars model. All dominant chemical pathways directly related to the global CO2-production have been quantified as a function of height up to 86 km. We quantitatively show that CO2-production is dominated by chemical pathways involving HOx and O-x. In addition, we find that NOx in combination with HOx and O-x exhibits a non-negligible contribution to CO2-production, especially in Mars' lower atmosphere. This study reveals that only a small number of chemical pathways contribute significantly to the atmospheric abundance of CO2 on Mars; their contributions to CO2-production vary considerably with altitude. This analysis also endorses the importance of transport processes in governing CO2-stability in the Martian atmosphere. Lastly, we identify a previously unknown chemical pathway involving HOx, O-x, and HO2-photodissociation, contributing 8% towards global CO2-production by chemical pathways using recommended up-to-date values for reaction rate coefficients.

J	Duncan, D.K.								Some surprises concerning the origin of the light elements								Nuclear Physics A				A621	1-2			10	13		10.1016/S0375-9474(97)00202-9				4 Aug. 1997	1997	The Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been used to obtain spectra of the boron 2500 Aring region in a total of 11 stars ranging from [Fe/H]=-0.35 to -2.96, including the most metal-poor star ever observed for B. Spectrum synthesis was used to determine the boron abundance for each star, with particular attention paid to the errors of each point, to permit judgement of the goodness-of-fit of models of Galactic chemical evolution. A straight line of slope close to 1 gives an excellent fit to a plot of log epsilon(B) vs. [Fe/H] or log epsilon(B) vs. [O/H] [in the usual notation log epsilon(B)=12.00+log N(B)/N(H) and [X/H]=log N(X)/N(H)-(log N(X)/N(H))odot], suggesting that the production of light elements such as B and Be are directly related to the production of heavier elements. There is no indication of a change in slope between halo and disk metallicities. The B/Be ratio is typically 10; NLTE effects can potentially raise this. Our data support a model in which most light element production comes from cosmic ray spallation of C and O nuclei onto protons and He nuclei, probably in the vicinity of massive supernovae (SN) in star-forming regions. They do not support the long-held (Reeves, Fowler, and Hoyle 1970) theory that light element production primarily occurs in the general ISM from the spallation of high-energy protons and alpha particles onto CNO nuclei. It is possible that the gamma rays recently detected from the Orion Nebula region are the signature of this process in action. Nevertheless, the light element data alone give the strongest evidence supporting a new model for the formation of the light elements.					Nuclei in the Cosmos.

Although these lines of evidence present seemingly consistent upper limits on pO(2,g), they are conceptually contradictory about the redox state of Archean surficial environments. Atmospheric, photochemical, and ecological modeling studies suggest weakly reducing environments under redox states represented by moderate H-2,H-g levels. However, current interpretations of Fedepletion in paleosols and the preservation of detrital minerals are based on low O-2,O-g levels at which the reducing detrital minerals are thermodynamically unstable and survive because of slow kinetics of oxidative weathering.In this study, we show that under the redox state indicated by the Archean pH(2,g) range, Fe2+ and reducing Fe (II)-minerals are actually thermodynamically stable and have no tendency to be oxidized. We emphasize that pH(2,g) values are orders of magnitude higher than pO(2,g) in the Archean atmosphere and that H-2,H-g and O-2,O-g are not in equilibrium. The redox states of Archean surface environments behave as though they were controlled by the more abundant H-2 instead of the very low O-2, as in modern anoxic basins. Weathering in this case should have involved non-redox acidic dissolution of Fe(II)-species or reductive reaction of Fe(III)-species. Fe(II)-depleted paleosols and the preservation of relatively reduced detrital minerals are natural consequences of their thermodynamic stabilities in the Archean Eon's reducing environments rather than slow kinetics of oxidizing reactions. After the appearance of oxygenic photosynthesis, probably in the middle/late Archean, locally oxygenated environments could have existed, while the atmosphere as a whole remained anoxic. The profile of redox states on the Archean surface seems to be a reverse analogue to the modern Earth. Although oxidizing dissolution of transition metals could happen in O-2-oases, quick reduction of oxyanions by abundant reductants, such as aqueous Fe2+, Fe(II)-minerals, and H-2, might have restricted riverine transport of oxyanions and potentially complicate the interpretation of signals of O-2 -whiffs in marine sediments.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0009-2541	1872-6836		WOS:000471231800005		
J	Yue, Changle; Bao, Wenjing; Liang, Jilei; Liu, Yunqi; Sun, Daofeng; Lu, Yukun								Application of POMs-Based Sulfided Catalyst in Hydrodesulfurization and Hydrogen Evolution by Electrolysis of Water								PROGRESS IN CHEMISTRY				34	5			1061	1075		10.7536/PC210608				MAY 24 2022	2022	Facing the challenge of severe environmental pollution caused by petroleum and the development of new energy, the desulfurization of petroleum fuels and sustainable clean alternative energy are regarded as important solutions. As a clean and sustainable energy carrier, hydrogen (H-2) is considered one of the most promising alternatives to carbon fuels. Therefore, hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and electrolysis of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are effective ways to solve the current energy and environmental problems caused by petroleum, and the development of high-efficiency and low-cost non-precious metal-based catalytic materials is a key step to achieve industrialization. Sulfided transition metals have high valence, unique crystal structure and thermal stability. Among them, MoS2 and WS2 are a type of band gap two-dimensional semiconductors with high planar carrier mobility and are used as non-noble metal sulfided catalysts representative material. It is worth noting that MoS2 and WS2 can realize HDS and HER processes at the same time. They not only serve as high-performance HDS catalysts to reduce the sulfur content of petroleum, but also shine in sustainable and clean green hydrogen production. Polyoxometalates (POMs), as a kind of inorganic nanoclusters with a clear structure composed of a variety of transition metals and oxygen atoms, are suitable precursors for preparing transition metal sulfided electrode materials. The sulfided catalyst can exhibit electrocatalytic performance close to that of noble metal-based catalysts, realizing green and efficient energy production and processing. Therefore, in recent years, sulfided catalysts prepared by POMs have become a research hotspot in green chemistry. This paper reviews the research progress of POMs-based sulfided catalysts in the HDS and HER fields, focusing on the working principles and interrelationships of the two types of processes. The catalytic mechanism, structural advantages and existing problems of POMs-based sulfided catalysts are summarized and discussed. Finally, some prospective of POMs-based sulfided catalysts for their application in those fields are proposed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1005-281X			WOS:000823136300001

Identifying the subsurface processes responsible for the bank-filtered water quality is challenging, but essential for predicting water quality changes and determining the necessity of post-treatment. However, no systematic approach for this has been proposed yet. In this study, the subsurface hydrogeochemical processes that caused the high concentrations of total iron (Fe) and sulfate (SO42-) in the bank-filtered water were investigated at a pilotscale RBF site in South Korea. For this purpose, water quality variations were monitored in both the extraction well and the adjacent river over five months. The volumetric mixing ratio between the river water and the native groundwater in the RBF well was calculated to understand the effect of mixing on the quality of water from the well and to assess the potential contribution of subsurface reactions to water quality changes. To identify the subsurface processes responsible for the evolution of Fe and SO42- during RBF, an inverse modeling based on the chemical mass balance was conducted using the water quality data and the calculated volumetric mixing ratio. The modeling results suggest that pyrite oxidation by abundant O-2 present in an unsaturated zone could be a primary process explaining the evolution of total Fe and SO42- during RBF at the study site. The presence of pyrite in the aquifer was indirectly supported by iron sulfate hydroxide (Fe(SO4)(OH)) detected in oxidized aquifer sediments.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0269-4042	1573-2983		WOS:000617851500001	33582939

The strategies of plant adaptation were divided into three phases according to the severity of drought: first, a positive defense phase that started from commencement of non-hydraulic root-sourced signals (nHRS) and ended at onset of hydraulic root-sourced signals (HRS)-the plant responded to imminent drought by decreasing stomatal aperture to lessen water loss and no membrane injury occurred. The second defense phase occurred between the onset of HRS and temporary wilting (TW), characterized by enhancement of reactive oxygen species (ROS), marked enzyme activity and increased MDA content. Mild lipid membrane peroxidation came mainly from a dynamic imbalance between free radical production and enzymatic defense reaction, which indicated that injury by ROS had not been completely repaired by increasing enzymatic activity. The third defense phase was from TW to permanent wilting (PW), the synthesis of SOD and CAT during TW could not deal with the collapse of antioxidant enzymes, and SOD and CAT activities began to decrease, which caused the excessive ROS production and thus serious membrane lipid peroxidation. The defense strategies to drought are similar among the varieties, but modern varieties LC8275 and GY602 bred after 1975 had relatively higher defense levels at all three defense phases, which suggest that modern varieties are more resistant than old ones, and artificial selection would lead to a different direction in evolution from natural selection.									30	2	1	0	30	1	34			0031-9317	1399-3054		WOS:000267072800006	19453498

An attempt to give a possible answer to the question was interpreted to be the result of endothermic nuclear transmutation of carbon and oxygen atom pairs in carbonate lattice of mantle containing crust, C-12 + (16)0 + 2e* + 2v --> 2 N-14 + He-4, with help of electropionic attraction effect (48% shrinkage) due to the excited electron capture and neutral pion catalysis. The excited electrons were generated by rapid fracture or sliding of carbonate crystals due to volcanic earthquake, and plenty of neutrinos were derived from the universe, mainly from the young sun. The formation of nitrogen would have continued for 1.3 billion years from 2.5 to 3.8 billion years ago in the Archean era, until the active volcanism or storm of neutrinos ceased. The possible nuclear transmutation rate of nitrogen atoms could be calculated as 2.3 x 10(6) atom/s.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1124-1896			WOS:000224393300008

Additionally, N-doped graphene (NG) enhanced the electron transfer and reduced the inner resistance. The material has a graphene-like morphology and highly dispersed Mo2C/MoN nanoparticles about 2 nm in diameter on the NG. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed that Mo2C/MoN/NG consisted of Mo2C and MoN composited together. Finally, Mo2C/MoN/NG exhibited remarkable performance as an electrocatalyst for the HER with a small overpotential of 78.82 mV and a small Tafel slope of 39.3 mV.dec(-1) in a 0.5 mol.L-1 H2SO4 solution. Its activity was approximately 30% lower than that of 20% Pt/C and 60% higher than that of NG. Also, it exhibited a low onset overpotential of 24.82 mV, which is similar to the theoretical HER potential. Our work provides a foundation for advanced HER applications of molybdenum compounds.									40	7	0	0	0	0	41			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000441237100007

In addition to be considered as a key factor underlying life-history traits evolution, the oxidative homeostasis has been shown to be involved in many host-symbiont associations. Previous studies suggest an interaction between the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia and the oxidative homeostasis of some insect hosts. This interaction is likely to exert a strong influence on the host evolution, as it has been proposed in the wasp Asobara tabida, whose dependence upon Wolbachia is due to the evolutionary loss of its ability to regulate the oxidative homeostasis in the absence of the symbiont. Although such cases of complete dependence are rare, cases of insects having lost only a part of their autonomy over the control of the oxidative homeostasis might be more common. If so, one can expect that insects having coevolved with Wolbachia will be more sensitive to oxidative stress when cured of their symbionts. We tested this hypothesis by studying the effects of an experimentally-induced oxidative stress on various life-history traits of Asobara japonica, a species closely related to A. tabida. For most of the life-history traits studied, the sensitivity of the wasps to oxidative stress did not correlate with their infection status. The only exception was the parasitic success. However, contrarily to our expectation, the sensitivity to oxidative stress was increased, rather than decreased, when Wolbachia was present. This result suggests that Wolbachia does not participate to mitigate oxidative stress in A. japonica, and that on the contrary its presence might still be costly in stressful environments.									1	1	0	0	2	0	2			1932-6203			WOS:000399875900078	28426794

Transient product evolution rates confirmed the redox nature of this sequence and the role of Cu dimers with labile oxygen atoms. N2O formed near ambient temperature as the initial decomposition product after quasiequilibrated adsorption of NO on reduced Cu+ dimers. The low activation energy for this step, the significant heat of adsorption of NO on Cu+ dimers, and the transition in prevalent Cu structures from {Cu2+-O-2(-)-Cu2+}(2+) to {Cu+-square-Cu+}(2+) lead to the observed decrease in NO decomposition rates above 750 K. Quasiequilibrium between O-2 and {Cu2+-O-2(-)-Cu2+}(2+) is mediated by a set of steps involving NO2 formation and decomposition, which lead to equilibrium NO2 concentrations during NO decomposition at 650-850 K on Cu-ZSM5. These pathways are faster than recombinative desorption steps requiring vicinal Cu2+ dimers with labile oxygen atoms to form O-2, In these steps, NO acts as a regenerable oxygen carrier that allows kinetic communication among remote adsorbed oxygen atoms via diffusion in the gas phase. Rate equations for the decomposition of NO and for product formation and the temperature dependence of their rate parameters are consistent with the kinetic data reported and with the effects of temperature on the relative abundance of adsorbed species and of Cu structures. These elementary steps suggest that redox steps restricted to Cu2+ and Cu+ cycles, the presence of vicinal Cu atoms to accommodate two adsorbed NO molecules and a two-electron reduction without the formation and agglomeration of Cu metal, and the balanced equilibrium between {Cu2+-O2--Cu2+}(2+) and {Cu+-square-Cu+}(2+) species account for the high NO decomposition rates achieved on Cu-ZSM5 catalysts.

Successful evaluation on the thermal behavior and product characteristics of the co-pyrolysis process is of crucial importance for predicting performance and improving efficiency of this technology. In this study, thermal behavior of platanus wood, two different rank coals (Pingzhuang lignite and Shenmu bituminous) and their blends during pyrolysis were studied via thermogravimetric analyzer. Raman spectroscopy technique was further employed to study the evolution of char structure. Thermogravimetric experiments indicated that the pyrolysis characteristics of their blends cannot be accurately forecasted based on individual component and blending ratio. The non-additive behavior of thermogravimetric curves of the blends suggested the existence of synergistic effects, which can promote the volatiles yields during the co-pyrolysis process. The most obvious synergistic effects were observed when the coal blending ratios were 30% for Pingzhuang lignite and 50% for Shenmu bituminous, respectively. In addition, iso-conversional method was used to solve activation energy. Non-additivity performance in the mean activation energy values of the blends was observed. The Raman results revealed that as the platanus wood blending ratio increased the Raman peak intensities of the char samples from pyrolysis of the blends also increased, which was probably attributed to the competition of oxygen-containing groups increment and disproportional impact of alkali and alkaline-earth metal species. The intensity ratios of some major Raman bands can provide useful information on char structure evolution. The generation of smaller aromatic rings structures (3-5 fused rings) was favored in these char samples with the higher platanus wood blending ratio. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

As reflected by O-2-TPD, the incorporation of Ni increases the ability to activate oxygen, and the strong synergy between Ni and Cu motivates the formation of active oxygen species (O-, O-latt(2-)). H-2-TPR further reveals that this strong synergy enhances the redox properties of catalysts. BET and Py-FTIR respectively demonstrate the enhancement in specific surface area and acidity due to this strong synergy. As confirmed by In situ DRIFTS, monodentate, bidentate, and bridging nitrates, as well as acetates, are active species. Wherein, monodentate nitrates, acetates, together R-NCO are facilitated in the formation, resulting from the synergy between Ni and Cu. Moreover, R-NO2 species appear after incorporating Ni. A possible mechanism of SCR-C3H6 over CuxNiyFez-C catalysts was proposed by the TPSR experiment.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000779663100002

The present study was carried out in Brahmanbaria district, covering an area of 18 km(2) in northeastern Bangladesh. The Chandina Formation is the main hydrostratigraphic unit of the area, which comprises silt and clay with high content of organic matter. Dissolved arsenic concentrations in groundwater are high, reaching > 400 mu g/L in some wells. Groundwater is reducing with general lack of detectable dissolved oxygen (DO) and contains low concentrations of nitrate and sulfate. Concentrations of dissolved Fe are high, which is in general in agreement with the reductive dissolution of ferric oxide and hydroxide hypothesis. Results of speciation modeling indicated the possibility of precipitation of siderite, and to less extent, vivianite for many samples. The log P-CO2 values were extremely high (> - 1.0 atm), suggesting production of CO2 in redox reactions involving the organic matter in the sediments. Redox potential values calculated on the basis of different redox couples and field Eh measurement indicated redox disequilibrium. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) performed in paired groups mode using the program PAST indicated highest degree of similarity among redox-sensitive elements NO3, Mn, Fe, PO4, SO4, As, and pH. Na and Cl form a distinct group, which indicate the influence of sea water. Bicarbonate generated in several redox reactions and carbonate dissolution was linked to almost all parameters and this holds even more for the electrical conductivity (EC). Principal components analysis (PCA) yielded Principal Component 1 (PCl) corresponding to sea water, and Principal Component 2 (PC2) corresponding to redox reactions with generally high arsenic concentrations. In summary, combination of speciation modeling and multivariate statistics proved to be useful in testing of conceptual model of geochemical evolution of arsenicrich groundwater.

J	Ye, Wanqi; Xu, Fuyuan; Jiang, Linhua; Duan, Ning; Li, Jianhui; Zhang, Feilong; Zhang, Ge; Chen, Lujun								A novel functional lead-based anode for efficient lead dissolution inhibition and slime generation reduction in zinc electrowinning								JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION				284						124767	10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.124767		JAN 2021		FEB 15 2021	2021	Lead-based alloy is the most widely used anode material in zinc electrowinning and other metallurgical processes. Lead dissolution during electrowinning not only results in resource loss and pollution generation, but also leads to deteriorations in product quality and adversely effects economic benefits. In this study, we propose a new functional anode preparation process that was precisely and completely fabricated by rapid electrodeposition of an active gamma-MnO2 layer on bare lead-based anode. The prepared anode (MnO2 pre-coated anode [WA]) exhibited an excellent performance in terms of both pollutant reduction and product promotion as compared with the typical bare Pb-1%Ag anode (TPA). Property characterizations and electrochemical analysis indicated that the active gamma-MnO2 layer showed complete and uniform coverage on the lead-based anode, which effectively blocked the contact and reaction of lead with electrolytes. This was beneficial for reducing the amounts of dissolved lead and significantly promoting the purity of zinc. Besides, the needle-like structure and positive electro-catalytical effects of gamma-MnO2 on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) lowered the anode overpotential, reversely inhibited the Mn2+ oxidation reaction, and reduced 94% of anode slime formation and 94% of lead migration. The MnO2 pre-coating process shows bright prospects for industrial applications in zinc electrowinning and other hydrometallurgy processes. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Chen, Jibao; Ma, Le; Duan, Pengfei; Yang, Shuqiong; Li, Hanxiao; Cai, Debao; Zhang, Mengya; Yang, Jiebing; Yao, Lunguang								Submergence response of pyruvate decarboxylase family genes in adzuki bean								BIOLOGIA				75	8			1213	1220		10.2478/s11756-020-00421-1		FEB 2020		AUG 2020	2020	Pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) is the main enzyme in ethanol fermentation in plant low-oxygen response. Expression of the PDC gene can be induced by submergence, a low-oxygen state, which has been demonstrated in Arabidopsis, maize and rice among other plants. However, it is unknown whether the gene expression has similar pattern in the Fabaceae family under low-oxygen stress, and unavailability of PDC family member sequences in Fabaceae hindered these studies. We aimed to comprehensively identify PDC genes in adzuki bean, and characterize their phylogenetic relationships and expression profile with the emphasis of expression response to submergence. Based on genome sequences and identified conserved domains, HMMER was used to mine PDC genes in adzuki bean in addition to mung bean, both of which are Vigna species under the Fabaceae family. Sequences were aligned using MUSCLE and Phylogenetic topology was decided by using MrBayes. Tissue expression patterns were decided using publically available RNASeq data. Adzuki bean plants were treated with submergence stress, and expressions under treatments were measured using qRT-PCR. We identified the genes in PDC family in the genomes of adzuki bean and mung bean. The known PDC peptides contain three conserved domains with the same order. Based on the domain composition, we identified four PDC family genes in adzuki bean, and three in mung bean. Phylogenetic reconstruction resolved three major classes. Class I of the family was grouped with PDC gene in Arabidopsis, and thus likely encodes PDC; one gene is present in this class in adzuki bean, whose expression was high in roots and nodules compared to other tissues, and was significantly induced under submergence treatment, reaching highest at 12 h after waterlogging. No Class I gene was identified in mung bean, possibly result of assembly gaps or failure of gene model prediction of mung bean genome. Class II genes are clustered together with larger subunit of acetolactate synthase, which have two representatives in mung bean and adzuki bean, respectively. There is one copy of gene in Class III in the genome of the two Vigna species, respectively, which is grouped with an uncharacterized Arabidopsis gene. Interestingly, the adzuki bean gene in this class was significantly induced by waterlogging, whose expression reaching the highest earlier than the Class I gene, which indicates that both the Class I and Class III genes in the PDC family are involved in low-oxygen stress response in adzuki bean. Pyruvate decarboxylase family genes were mined in adzuki bean and mung bean, whose phylogeny was clarified into three independent classes. Expression of a putative PDC gene was significantly elevated by submergence stress in adzuki bean. The Class III gene in adzuki bean was significantly induced in expression by waterlogging, too, yet its expression reached highest earlier than putative PDC genes, suggesting involvement of the Class III genes in low-oxygen stress response.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0006-3088	1336-9563		WOS:000515889500001

The high temperature (>1100 degrees C) growth and low active surface areas of REs hinder their use as an efficient electrocatalyst. Herein, different morphologies of Nd were successfully fabricated in situ on the surface of graphene using a double-zone chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The morphology of the Nd material on graphene is controlled, which results in the significant enhancement of the large specific surface area and electrochemical active area of the composite material due to the spatial morphology of Nd, thereby improving the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance in an alkaline medium. The significantly enhanced HER activity with an overpotential of 75 mV and a Tafel slope of 95 mV dec(-1) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is observed in Nd-GF. Mainly, a high specific surface area of similar to 2217 cm(2) g(-1) and the porosity of graphene play major roles in the enhancement of activity. Thus, the present work provides a new strategy for the neodymium engineering synthesis of efficient rare earth-graphene composite electrocatalysts with a high electrochemical active area.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000695209200001	34515273

In a certain group of chemoautotrophs, the reductive citric acid cycle is an engine of synthesis, taking in CO2 and synthesizing the molecules of the cycle. We have examined the chemistry of a model system of C, H, and O that starts with carbon dioxide and reductants and uses redox couples as the energy source. To inquire into the reaction networks that might emerge, we start with the largest available database of organic molecules, Beilstein on-line, and prune by a set of physical and chemical constraints applicable to the model system. From the 3.5 million entries in Beilstein we emerge with 153 molecules that contain all 11 members of the reductive citric acid cycle. A small number of selection rules generates a very constrained subset, suggesting that this is the type of reaction model that will prove useful in the study of biogenesis, The model indicates that the metabolism shown in the universal chart of pathways may be central to the origin of life, is emergent from organic chemistry, and may be unique.									214	1	1	0	151	0	222			0027-8424			WOS:000088048400011	10859347

The surface area of nanoporous silver was 62 times larger than that of dense silver according to the enhancement of the charge associated with the reduction of adsorbed oxygen. In 0.9 M KOH solution with 0.3 M formaldehyde, there exists oxidation of formaldehyde on the nanoporous silver electrode, showing the electrochemical catalytic activity toward formaldehyde. And the process is confirmed to be controlled by the diffusion. With increasing scanning cycles, coarsened and accumulated ligaments appeared, and the oxidation current density decreased simultaneously. (C) 2015 The Electrochemical Society.

Herein, high-crystalline PCN flake composed porous nanotubes (cPCNt) were simply synthesized, using the melamine/cyanuric acid supramolecular complex as a precursor under assistance of silicane oil, and the cPCNt with the optimal balance between crystallinity and surface area exhibits prominently enhanced visible light absorption, charge separation and transport, and photocatalytic water splitting activity. The visible-light photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate of cPCNt in the presence of triethanolamine is -69.7-fold higher than that of PCN, with apparent quantum yields of 13.0% at 420 nm and 5.5% at 480 nm, and its overall water splitting activity is -6.9-fold higher under simulated solar light irradiation. This work clarifies the significance of balancing influences of crystallinity and surface area for photoactivity improvement.									8	0	0	0	3	0	8			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773001400003

Based on first-order kinetic model, S-N co-doped rGO (SNG) presents an apparent reaction rate constant of 0.043 +/- 0.002 min(-1), which is 86.6, 22.8, 19.7, and 4.5-fold as high as that over graphene oxide (GO), rGO, S-doped rGO (S-rGO), and N-doped rGO (N-rGO), respectively. A variety of characterization techniques and density functional theory calculations are employed to investigate the synergistic effect of sulfur and nitrogen co-doping. Co-doping of rGO at an optimal sulfur loading can effectively break the inertness of carbon systems, activate the sp(2)-hybridized carbon lattice and facilitate the electron transfer from covalent graphene sheets for PMS activation. Moreover, both electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and classical quenching tests are employed to investigate the generation and evolution of reactive radicals on the SNG sample for phenol catalytic oxidation. This study presents a novel metal-free catalyst for green remediation of organic pollutants in water.									441	29	1	0	159	0	459			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000357337400008	25786381

Progress of reactions was followed by measuring the mass loss, evolved gas analysis, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The samples were heated from room temperature conditions to 975 degrees C at four different heating rates of 5, 10, 15, and 20 degrees C min (-1). The exhaust gas composition was quantified using a non-dispersive infrared analyzer. Experimental results indicate that the system requires a critical CO concentration buildup before the combustion process accelerates. The carbon dioxide production begins and peaks later than carbon monoxide. A total of three peaks occur in both carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide evolution. An Arrhenius dependence for the peak separation times with respect to the starting peak or trough temperature was observed. This work experimentally identifies the various regimes of oxidation chemistry for this fuel oxidizer combination over the entire combustion process via the trajectory of CO and CO2 evolution with temperature. The paths in this trajectory are then mapped onto the mass loss profiles. Modulated TGA experiments were also conducted to obtain the activation energy during the combustion process that shows overlapping mass loss regions. This activation energy is obtained over a wide range of temperatures using this model free-approach. The activation energies obtained using the modulated TGA experiments were also compared to those obtained using the Flynn-Wall-Ozawa method. This work provides new insights into the oxidation kinetics of graphitic carbon with solid copper oxide as an oxidizer.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1388-6150	1588-2926		WOS:000645173200002

Material processed by the CNO cycle in stellar interiors is enriched in O-17. When mixing processes from the stellar surface reach these layers, as occurs when stars become red giants and undergo the first dredge up, the abundance of O-17 increases. Such an occurrence explains the drop of the O-16/O-17 observed in RGB stars with mass larger than similar to 1.5 M-circle dot. As a consequence, the interstellar medium is continuously polluted by the wind of evolved stars enriched in O-17.Aims. Recently, the Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics (LUNA) collaboration released an improved rate of the O-17(p, alpha)N-14 reaction. In this paper we discuss the impact that the revised rate has on the O-16/O-17 ratio at the stellar surface and on O-17 stellar yields.Methods. We computed stellar models of initial mass between 1 and 20 M-circle dot and compared the results obtained by adopting the revised rate of the O-17(p, alpha)N-14 to those obtained using previous rates.Results. The post- first dredge up O-16/O-17 ratios are about 20% larger than previously obtained. Negligible variations are found in the case of the second and the third dredge up. In spite of the larger O-17(p, alpha)N-14 rate, we confirm previous claims that an extra-mixing process on the red giant branch, commonly invoked to explain the low carbon isotopic ratio observed in bright low-mass giant stars, marginally affects the O-16/O-17 ratio. Possible effects on AGB extra-mixing episodes are also discussed. As a whole, a substantial reduction of O-17 stellar yields is found. In particular, the net yield of stars with mass ranging between 2 and 20 M-circle dot is 15 to 40% smaller than previously estimated.Conclusions. The revision of the O-17(p, alpha)N-14 rate has a major impact on the interpretation of the O-16/O-17 observed in evolved giants, in stardust grains and on the O-17 stellar yields.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			1432-0746			WOS:000394465000127

Before mixture, the storage catalysts (BaO/CeO2) were treated at 800 degrees C for 5 h in a steam and CO2-containing air. The storage catalysts were characterized in detail by X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption-desorption, energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Results show highest Ba dispersion on CeO2 for 3BC sample. 5BC sample forms large BaCO3 particle leading to lower Ba dispersion than 3BC sample. NOx storage capacity was investigated in steady-state and transient NO/O-2 adsorption reactions in the temperature range from 100 degrees C to 300 degrees C. As BaO loading increases, the PA-BC catalysts exhibit nonlinear enhancement for NOx storage capacity (NSC) compared with PA-Ce sample. And PA-3BC sample possesses superior NOx storage capacity. The evolution and stability of NOx adsorbed species at 100 degrees C were explored by in situ DRITFS. DRIFTS results show that PA-3BC and PA-5BC samples present obviously different NOx adsorbed species from PA-Ce sample. Besides, nitrate formation is more facilitated for PA-3BC sample compared with the PA-5BC sample. These results can be contributed to high Ba dispersion on CeO2, which is advantageous to Ba-Ce contact and NOx trapping. And the Ba sites in intimate contact with CeO2 can effectively utilize the Ba sites and oxygen from CeO2 to form nitrates at low temperature, which possess higher stability than Ce nitrates.

Chudnenko, Konstantin/H-8108-2018	Chudnenko, Konstantin/0000-0002-1547-2188			Spinel-Sapphirine Reaction Structures in the Garnet Metaultramafic Rocks of the Omolon Massif: Petrogenesis and Geological Interpretation (Northeast Asia)								RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PACIFIC GEOLOGY				12	3			174	189		10.1134/S1819714018030028				MAY 2018	2018	Spinel-sapphirine reaction structures are studied in detail in the sapphirine gedritites which form a small segregation in one of the garnet metaultramafic bodies framing the Aulandzha charnockitic dome (the pre-Riphean basement of the Omolon Massif). It is established that the sapphirine gedritites resulted from the retrograde evolution of the garnet-spinel metaultramafic rocks, the formation temperature of which may have exceeded 900A degrees C at a probable pressure no more than 7 kbar. It is shown that the spinel-sapphirine reaction structures were formed under conditions of elevated O-2 potential close to the magnetite-hematite buffer. Subsequent diaphthoresis of the metaultramafic rocks was accompanied by an increase in the H2O potential and decrease in temperature to at least 760A degrees C. This explains the formation of another group of diaphthorites, garnet gedritites, the index minerals of which are sodium gedrite and calcic plagioclase with strong inverse zoning. A comprehensive analysis of the new petrological data and published materials on the isotope-geochronological study of the pre-Riphean basement of the Omolon Massif makes it possible to attribute the formation of the sapphirine gedritites to 1.9 Ga (middle of the second half of the Early Proterozoic, according to the General Stratigraphic Scale of Russia). The unusually high value of the O-2 potential calculated for the spinel-sapphirine reaction structures; the unique magnesian-alumina composition of the gedritites; and the extremely high contents of Zr, Ba, Rb, and Hf allow O.V. Avchenko to hypothesize that the protoliths of these scarce rocks were products of weathering crust after orthomagmatic ultramafic rocks. In this case, the calculated parameters for the formation of the spinel-sapphirine reaction structures may indicate that the value of the O-2 potential on the Earth's surface in the Paleoproterozoic corresponded to the magnetite-hematite buffer.									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			1819-7140	1819-7159		WOS:000435440000002

Dibutylurea was found to inhibit photosynthetic oxygen evolution, photo-induced reduction of ferricyanide, and reduction of NADP. It produced a sigmoidal dose response for inhibition of ferricyanide reduction with an I-50 Of 167 mu M. Other symmetric alkylureas were found to only weakly inhibit ferricyanide reduction regardless of the dose applied. Dibutylurea produced a dose response for electron transport inhibition when applied to KCN/Hg-inhibited chloroplasts and inhibited NADP reduction in the presence of 1 mu M DBMIB and a TMPD bypass. These results suggest dibutylurea inhibits photosynthetic electron transport in a manner similar to known PSII inhibitors, with the possible site of action in PSII on the reducing side of the Q(B) protein complex.

The samples were characterized by XRD, TG, FESEM, XPS, UV-vis, and PL. The results of XRD and XPS reveal that Y3+ have been successfully incorporated into BiFeO3 lattice. FESEM and UV-vis results reveal that Y doping leads to a decrease in BiFeO3 particle size and band gap. PL shows that the recombination rate of photogenerated electron hole pairs of Bi0.95Y0.05FeO3 is the lowest. The influences of Y doping content on photocatalytic activity of BiFeO3 have been investigated. The results show that the best photocatalytic activity is Bi0.95Y0.05FeO3. Compared with pure BiFeO3, Bi0.95Y0.05FeO3 increased the degradation rate of MO by 1.3 times in 120 min. This may be due to the larger light response range and the lower photogenerated electron hole pairs recombination rate.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			0268-2605	1099-0739		WOS:000600689200001	33251649

The effect of various N-doped content on the electrochemical performance of the catalyst were investigated and the Cu-N-C-0.25 exhibited the best OER/ORR catalytic activities. When it was applied to the cathode of the zinc-air batteries, the power density of Cu-N-C-0.25 was 209.1 mW cm(-2), which exceeded that of the commercial Pt/C +/- IrO2 hybrid catalyst (157 mW cm(-2)). The excellent electrochemical performance may be attributed to large number of active sites and high specific surface area on Cu-N-C electrocatalyst. It will be a promising alternative to precious metal catalysts containing Pt, Ir or Ru and their oxides.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1793-2920	1793-7094		WOS:000514102100012		
J	Jin, H.; Maezawa, K.; Mukai, T.								Effects of charge exchange and electron impact ionization on the formation of the magnetic pileup boundary at Mars								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS				111	A5					A05306	10.1029/2005JA011127				MAY 23 2006	2006	[1] A relatively sharp increase in the solar wind magnetic field, Magnetic Pileup Boundary (MPB), has been observed in the inner Martian magnetosheath. We examined effects of exospheric processes, such as charge exchange reactions (CE) and electron impact ionizations (EII), on the formation of the MPB by using a newly developed two-dimensional global MHD model coupled to Monte Carlo simulations. The CE and EII processes change the energy distribution of the solar wind plasma, causing a depletion of the thermal pressure, and thus an enhancement of magnetic pressure so as to maintain the pressure balance in the radial direction. Beside decreasing the thermal pressure, these processes decelerate the solar wind by adding mass of slow ions ( protons and oxygen ions). These processes were treated self-consistently in the new MHD model. The MHD model implicitly includes the time evolution of ion and electron distributions being deformed from Maxwellian shapes under the influence of CE and EII reactions, by making use of their reaction rate coefficients that were derived as functions of "effective temperatures'' from Monte Carlo simulations. The MHD simulation results suggest that an enhancement of magnetic field magnitude occurs in the inner magnetosheath mainly due to the CE effect at the solar minimum and to the EII effect at the solar maximum. EII also decelerates the solar wind significantly through the mass-loading effect, which lengthens the interaction time between the solar wind plasma and the exospheric atoms, resulting in an additional enhancement of magnetic field magnitude both at the solar minimum and maximum. It was also found that these exospheric processes significantly influence the ion density profiles above the upper ionosphere. The large and nearly constant scale height of total ion density as observed by past measurements can be caused by the EII process. Moreover, EII produces a large number of O+ ions above the ionopause especially at the solar maximum, which is potentially important in terms of atmospheric escape.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000238045300001

We use the data to determine abundances for the elements N, O, Ne, S, Ar, and, for the first time in BCGs, Fe; discuss their origin; and constrain current nucleosynthesis stellar models.The main result of the present study is that none of the heavy element-to-oxygen abundance ratios studied here (N/O, Ne/O, S/O, Ar/O, Fe/O) depend on oxygen abundance. We conclude that all these heavy elements have a primary origin and are produced by the same massive (M greater than or equal to 10 M.) stars. The dispersion of the N/O ratio is found to be remarkably small, being only +/- 0.08 in the log. This can only be understood if primary N is produced in massive stars, not in intermediate-mass (4 M.less than or equal to M less than or equal to 9 M.) stars as commonly thought. BCGs show the same O/Fe overabundance with respect to the Sun (similar to 0.34 in the log) as galactic halo stars, suggesting the same chemical enrichment history, and supporting the scenario of an early enrichment of the galactic halo by massive Population III stars.We have compared the observed heavy element abundance ratios with theoretical yields from current massive star nucleosynthesis models from Weaver and Woosley (1993). The small dispersion in the heavy element abundance ratios suggests that there is not a large IMF variation between BCGs with different metallicities.									181	0	0	0	0	0	181			0004-637X			WOS:A1995QY12900011

It is known that different types of oxygen groups would be normally remained on g-C3N4 during synthesis, and g-C3N4 with oxygen groups was reported to have promising photocatalytic performance experimentally. To understand the mechanism of the enhanced photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 with oxygen groups, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out in this work to investigate the band structures of g-C3N4 with different types of oxygen groups (-COOH, -OH or =O) systematically, thus predicting its capability of activation of electron-hole pair. In addition, in order to consider the position of oxygen groups on g-C3N4 and its corresponding effect on the band structure, graphitic carbon nitride nanoribbons (CNNR) is built. It is found that only -OH and =O groups can be stably attached at the center of CNNR, while all the three types of groups are stable at the edges. Additionally, -COOH or -OH group binding with N atoms (N-COOH or N-OH) can reduce the bandgap of CNNR significantly, and the bandgap further reduces sharply at high concentration of N-COOH or N-OH, while attaching =O does not change its bandgap much regardless the position of the groups expect replacing H atom at the right edge. Therefore, attaching N-OH at the middle, replacing H atoms by =O at the right edge and attaching N-COOH or N-OH at both sides are promising ways to reduce the band gap of CNNR and thus may improve the generation of electron-hole pair. Furthermore, the higher the concentration of the oxygen groups, the better the performance it has.									37	3	0	0	7	0	37			2214-9937			WOS:000433254700002

It was replaced for phenylalanine by site-directed mutagenesis. The X-ray structure of the mutant enzyme was determined at 1.96 angstrom resolution. Comparison of spatial structures and absorption spectra of wild-type and mutant holoenzymes demonstrated that the replacement did not result in essential changes of the conformation of the active site Tyr58Phe MGL The K-d value of PLP for Tyr58Phe MGL proved to be comparable to the K-d value for the wild-type enzyme. The replacement led to a decrease of catalytic efficiencies in both gamma- and beta-elimination reactions of about two orders of magnitude as compared to those for the wild-type enzyme. The rates of exchange of C-alpha- and C-beta- protons of inhibitors in D2O catalyzed by the mutant form are comparable with those for the wild-type enzyme. Spectral data on the complexes of the mutant form with the substrates and inhibitors showed that the replacement led to a change of rate the limiting step of the physiological reaction. The results allowed us to conclude that Tyr58 is involved in an optimal positioning of the active site Lys210 at some stages of gamma- and beta-elimination reactions.

The materials were studied by atomic force microscopy ( AFM) to determine their surface topologies and by electrochemical techniques to establish the catalytic activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction ( OER) and also, for the PtOx and PtOx-RuO2 composites, the ethanol oxidation reactions in acid media. The stability of PtOx coating covered by a Nafion (R) film was also tested by long-term operation. The AFM results indicated sites of heterogeneous deposition and the electrochemical studies demonstrated that the active surface area changed considerably with the proposed method of modification. The IrO2/BDD electrode showed the best performance to the OER with the onset of the oxidation current at similar to 1.4 V, a value 200 mV lower than for the PtOx/BDD electrode. The enhanced stability of PtOx/BDD electrodes achieved by the application of a Nafion (R) film and already reported in acid media was further proved using the ethanol oxidation reaction. Only a small loss of activity ( 6%) was observed after 4-hours electrolysis while one-thousand voltammetric cycles left the surface practically unchanged. In addition, preliminary studies for the same reaction on PtOx/BDD and PtOx-RuO2/BDD electrodes demonstrated the excellent activity of these mixed Sol-Gel coatings on the BDD surface and the possibility of further investigations for practical applications.									27	1	0	0	1	1	29			0103-5053	1678-4790		WOS:000236732400007

Waste so treated may be safely disposed of or reused. In this work a model high strength agricultural waste, potato peel, was subjected to TAD to study the effects of oxygen supply at 0.1. 0.25. 0.5 and 1.0 vvm (volume air per volume slurry per minute) under batch conditions at 55 degreesC for 156 It on the process. Process pH was controlled at 7.0 or left unregulated-Effects of waste load, as soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD), on TAD were studied at 4.0. 8.0. 12.0 and 16.0 gl(-1) (soluble COD) at pH 7.0, 0.5 vvm and 55 degreesC. Efficiency of treatment, as degradation of total solids. total suspended solids and soluble solid. as well as soluble COD significantly increased with aeration rate, while acetate production increased as the aeration rate decreased or waste load increased, signifying deterioration in treatment. Negligible acetate, and no other acids were produced at 1.0 Production of propionate and other acids increased after acetate concentration had started to decrease and. during unregulated reactions coincided with the drop in the pH of the slurry. Acetate production was more closely associated with periods of oxygen limitation than were other acids. Reduction in oxygen availability led to deterioration in treatment efficiency as did increase in waste load. These variables may be manipulated to control treated waste quality.

The as-prepared NPCA calcined at 900 degrees C (NPCA-900) exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance with high diffusion-limiting current density and stability comparable to those of commercial Pt/C catalysts in alkaline environment. The remarkable ORR performance of NPCA could be ascribed to the abundant porosity, large specific surface area (1060 m(2) g(-1)), as well as the doping of Fe-N (especially pyridinic N). The NPCA derived from cheap petroleum asphalt has good application future in the field of catalysis, while it may pave a new way to realize the clean and high value utilization of heavy oils.

These can be explained by there being a difference in density, C/O ratio, or chemical evolutionary state along the ridge. The presence at the carbon-rich "cyanopolyyne peak" (CP) of specific oxygen-bearing molecules, believed to be products of grain surface reactions, leads us to investigate the possibility that the gradients are produced following the removal of icy grain mantles. We identify the mantle removal mechanism as the explosive desorption of photolyzed ices, induced by MHD waves as they propagate within the cloud. By identifying the protostellar object IRAS 03381+2540 as the source of these waves, we have constructed a dynamical-chemical model for the evolution of the TMC-1. ridge. The results of detailed chemical kinetic calculations are presented. We find that injection into the gas phase of the carbon-bearing species C2H2, C2H4 and CH4 can transiently enhance the production of many organic molecules, particularly the cyanopolyynes and polyacetylenes, and hence that the observed gradients can indeed be produced in this model. We suggest that other mantle-driven reaction pathways, involving formation of methylated chains (e.g., CH3C3N) by gas phase methyl cation transfer, as well as formation of carbenes and suboxides by fragmentation of surface-formed cumulenone compounds, might explain the presence of many other organic molecules in TMC-1. In our view the current chemical state of TMC-1 reflects a transient phase that accompanies the earliest epochs of low-mass formation and that regions rich in organic molecules should be observable around known "Class 0" protostellar sources and be offset from them by about an ion-neutral damping length. Molecular clumps in dense cores should also show structure on this scale-length.									92	1	0	0	1	0	92			0004-637X			WOS:000087661900022		
J	Saran, M								To what end does nature produce superoxide? NADPH oxidase as an autocrine modifier of membrane phospholipids generating paracrine lipid messengers								FREE RADICAL RESEARCH				37	10			1045	1059		10.1080/10715760310001594631				SEP 2003	2003	Production of superoxide anion O-2(.-) by the membrane-bound enzyme NADPH oxidase of phagocytes is a long-known phenomenon; it is generally assumed that O-2(.-) helps phagocytes kill bacterial intruders. The details and the chemistry of the killing process have, however, remained a mystery. Isoforms of NADPH oxidase exist in membranes of nearly every cell, suggesting that reactive oxygen species (ROS) participate in intra - and inter cellular signaling processes. What the nature of the signal is exactly, how it is transmitted, and what structural characteristics a receptor of a "radical message" must have, have not been addressed convincingly. This review discusses how the action of messengers is in agreement with radical-specific behavior.In search for the smallest common denominator of cellular free radical activity we hypothesize that O-2(.-) and its conjugate acid, HO2. , may have evolved under primordial conditions as regulators of membrane mechanics and that isoprostanes, widely used markers of "oxidative stress", may be an adventitious correlate of this biologic activity of O-2(.-) / HO2. . An overall picture is presented that suggests that O-2(.-) / HO2. radicals, by modifying cell membranes, help other agents gain access to the hydrophobic region of phospholipid bilayers and hence contribute to lipid-dependent signaling cascades. With this, O-2(.-) / HO2. are proposed as indispensable adjuvants for the generation of cellular signals, for membrane transport, channel gating and hence, in a global sense, for cell viability and growth. We also suggest that many of the allegedly O-2(.-) dependent bacterial pathologies and carcinogenic derailments are due to membrane-modifying activity rather than other chemical reactions of O-2(.-) / HO2. .

The results show that the hybrid inhibitor has strong inhibitory effect on the self-corrosion and little impact on the discharge performance of AA5052 anode, so the discharge stability and efficiency, safety and storage time of aluminum air batteries are greatly improved. The optimal concentration is 10mM CaO and 4mM Asp. The hybrid inhibitor mainly retards anodic process of self-corrosion reaction, so it is more suitable in the case where discharge current density is not very large. According to the morphology simulation, the (1 (1) over bar0) face of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)(2)) is suitable as the adsorption substrate, given that it provides more adsorption active sites. Combining experimental research with theoretical studies, the inhibition mechanism of the hybrid inhibitor is: calcium hydroxide formed from calcium oxide in alkaline electrolyte adheres to the surface of aluminum by geometric coverage effect, and promotes the adsorption of L-aspartic, which active sites are located on the oxygen atom of two hydroxyl groups and the nitrogen atom of amino group, thereby forming Ca(OH)(2)-Asp and Al-Asp monolayer composite films, they effectively block the dissolution of AA5052 alloy.

Ag(I) is potentially an oxidative catalyst but is inhibited by the high potentials for accessing the Ag(II/I) and Ag(III/II) couples. We report here that the complex ions AgCl2- and AgCl32- form in concentrated Cl- solutions, avoiding AgCl precipitation and providing access to the higher oxidation states by delocalizing the oxidative charge over the Cl- ligands. Catalysis is homogeneous and occurs at high rates and low overpotentials (10 mV at the onset) with mu M Ag(I). Catalysis is enhanced in D2O as solvent, with a significant H2O/D2O inverse kinetic isotope effect of 0.25. The results of computational studies suggest that Cl- oxidation occurs by 1e- oxidation of AgCl32- to AgCl3- at a decreased potential, followed by Cl- coordination, presumably to form AgCl42- as an intermediate. Adding a second Cl- results in redox potential leveling, with further oxidation to {AgCl2(Cl-2)}(-) followed by Cl-2 release.									64	1	0	0	16	0	64			0002-7863			WOS:000351187200011	25700124

The electrochemical production of hydrogen requires catalyst and development of efficient non-Pt catalysts or catalysts with low Pt content are in demand. Herein, we demonstrate the photochemical synthesis of a hydrogen evolution electrocatalyst poly(alpha-terthiophene)-Pt nanoparticle hybrid material (polyTT-Pt) of low Pt content and its electrocatalytic activity. The synthesis of polyTT-Pt hybrid material involves the photoinduced electron transfer between alpha-terthiophene (alpha-TT) and PtCl62- and the subsequent in situ growth of polymer and Pt nanoparticles. The irradiation of the mixture of alpha-TT and PtCl62- with sunlamp initiates the oxidative polymerization and reduction of Pt complex to Pt nanoparticles. The polymer has cabbage-like microstructure and the in situ grown Pt nanoparticles have an average size of 1.8 nm. The Pt nanoparticles are embedded into the polymer matrix as well as randomly distributed over the polymer. The hybrid material contains 2.91 wt% of Pt and it shows characteristic electrochemical signature with an electrochemically active surface area of 35.7 m(2)/g(pt). The hybrid material polyTT-Pt is electrocatalytically highly active though it contains very small amount of Pt. It efficiently catalyses hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the bench mark current density of 10 mA/cm(2) is achieved at an overpotential of 67 mV. The mass activity of the hybrid catalyst is 1172 mA/mg(pt) at the overpotential of 67 mV. The high activity is ascribed to the high electronic conductivity of the polymer matrix, facile access of electrolyte due to the embedded small nanoparticles and the presence of large number of catalytically active Pt sites. Tafel analysis suggests that the HER follows the Volmer-Tafel mechanism. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The HER activity of MoSe2 originates mainly from the edge sites of Se atoms, but the low concentration of Se exposed to the electrolyte hampers the performance. Hence, activating a larger portion of the basal plane of Se atoms is an effective way to improve the HER properties. Herein, a 3D hierarchic nanoflower structure comprising MoSe2 with atomic-scale interlayered graphene layers in the nanosheets is designed and prepared to improve the electron conductivity and decrease the proportions of inactive basal planes. Raman scattering, transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy verify effective insertion of graphene layers in MoSe2, and the HER characteristics are improved as exemplified by a small overpotential of 175 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope of 58 mV dec(-1), and excellent durability with only small deterioration of 10 mV after 10,000 cycles. First-principles density functional theory and finite element method calculations corroborate the experimental results, revealing better conductivity and hydrogen adsorption/desorption ability rendered by the graphene layers. Our results reveal a new and effective strategy to optimize the structure and composition and reduce the hydrogen adsorption energy barrier in the pursuit of high-efficiency non-noble metal catalysts.									27	1	0	0	0	0	27			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000508464500053	31877010

The decay of a plasma with negative ions consists of two stages. During the first stage of the afterglow, electrons dominate plasma diffusion and negative ions are trapped inside the vessel by the static electric field; the flux of negative ions to the walls is nearly zero. During this stage, the electron escape frequency increases considerably in the presence of negative ions, and can eventually approach free electron diffusion. During the second stage of the afterglow, electrons have disappeared, and positive and negative ions diffuse to the walls with the ion-ion ambipolar diffusion coefficient. Theories for plasma decay have been developed for equal and strongly different ion (T-t) and electron (T-e) temperatures. In the case T-i = T-e, the species spatial profiles are similar and an analytic solution exists. When detachment is important in the afterglow (weakly electronegative gases, e.g., oxygen) the plasma decay crucially depends on the product of negative ion detachment frequency (gamma (d)) and diffusion time (tau (d)). If gamma (d)tau (d)>2, negative ions convert to electrons during their diffusion towards the walls. The presence of detached electrons results in "self-trapping" of the negative ions, due to emerging electric fields, and the negative ion flux to the walls is extremely small. In the case T-i<<T-e, the spatiotemporal dynamics is more complicated due to the presence of negative ion density fronts. During the afterglow, although negative ions diffuse freely in the plasma core, the negative ion fronts propagate towards the chamber walls with a nearly constant velocity. The evolution of ion fronts in the afterglow of electronegative plasmas is important, since it determines the time needed for negative ions to reach the wall, and thus influence surface reactions in plasma processing.									30	0	0	0	0	0	30			1539-3755	1550-2376		WOS:000171136400076	11580449

The prepared heterostructures is completely investigated by a collection of characterizations. Interestingly, the unique C-O-Ti linkage between gamma-graphyne and TiO2 nanotube arrays is verified by both X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared analysis. After modification of gamma-graphyne, the maximum transient photo-current and photo-potential of TiO2 nanotube arrays are improved by 2.2 and 1.3 folds, respectively. Moreover, a maximum of 3.64 and 1.35 folds enhancements are severally verified for the photoelectrocatalytic degradation of levofloxacin and rhodamine B over the heterostructures compared to that of TiO2 nanotube arrays. Furtherly, the heterostructures also show superior photoelectrocatalytic performance on nitrogen fixation and oxygen evolution than TiO2 nanotube arrays. The crystal, morphological, photoelectrochemical, and photoelectrocatalytic stability of the heterostructures are confirmed. This work sheds light on designing gamma-graphyne modified composites for photoelectrochemical and photoelectrocatalytic application.									101	3	0	0	16	0	102			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000591344900001

To understand the feasibility of the reaction driven by the visible light of the strongest part of the solar energy, we have investigated the effect of different concentrations of oxygen group element dopants on the electronic and optical properties of BaTiO3 by using first-principles density functional theory calculations with meta-GGA + MBJ potential. The formation energy of each doped structure is calculated to examine the feasibility of synthesis in energy. The energy band gaps and the energy positions of conduction and valence bands are calculated and the results reveal that all the structures except the one that doped with 5 at% Te satisfy the conditions of water splitting although the energy band gaps of the doped BaTiO3 decrease obviously. The partial charge distributions of conduct band maximum and valence band minimum are used to demonstrate the electron-hole separation. The absorption coefficients are calculated for all the considered structures. The results demonstrate that the doped chalcogens can significantly enhance the absorption in visible light range, which implies that the doped BaTiO3 are promising to catalyze the hydrogen production from water splitting driven by solar energy.

Nevertheless, the cultivation of phototrophic organisms to high cell densities (HCDs) is hampered by limited reactor concepts. Co-cultivation of the photoautotrophic Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and the chemo-heterotrophic P. taiwanensis VLB 120 enabled HCDs up to 51.8 g(CDW) L-1. Respective biofilms have been grown as a biofilm in capillary flow-reactors, and oxygen evolution, total biomass, as well as the ratio of the two strains, have been followed under various cultivation conditions. Furthermore, biofilm formation on a microscopic level was analyzed via confocal laser scanning microscopy using a custom made flow-cell setup. The concept of mixed trophies co-cultivation was coupled to biotransformation, namely the oxyfunctionalization of cyclohexane to cyclohexanol. For benchmarking, the performance of the phototrophic reactionwas compared to the chemical process, and to a biotechnological approach using a heterotrophic organism only.

The extent of quinone pool reconstitution was highly specific for the type of quinone molecules used. The far most efficient component was the natural plastoquinone-9 (PQ-9) that exhibited significant reconstitution effects at very low ratios of PQ-9 per PS2. In marked contrast, the widely used exogenous acceptor phenyl-p-benzoquinone (Ph-p-BQ) did not increase the pool capacity even at a molar Ph-p-BQ:PS2 ratio of 150:1. The samples reconstituted with PQ-9 provided a most suitable material for all experiments performed in the absence of exogenous artificial accepters in order to avoid interference by disturbing artefacts. The inherent potential of PQ-9 reconstituted PS2 membrane fragments was clearly demonstrated by monitoring the characteristic oscillation pattern of flash-induced oxygen evolution. These measurements permit for the first time unambiguous determination of the population of superreduced redox states of the water oxidising complex (WOC) in PS2 membrane fragments. A selective population of up to 90 % can be achieved for redox state S-2 by suitable treatment of PQ-9 reconstituted samples with NH2OH.					9th Workshop on Photosynthesis9th Workshop on Photosynthesis	APR 11-14, 1996APR 11-14, 1996	Deut Forschungsgemeinsch; Humboldt Univ, Inst BiolDeut Forschungsgemeinsch; Humboldt Univ, Inst Biol	WUSTERHAUSEN, GERMANYWUSTERHAUSEN, GERMANY	2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0300-3604			WOS:A1997YA11100023

Chronoamperometry tests ranged between 0.3 and 2.0 V were carried out after both bioelectrodes were developed. A maximum current density up to 1.6 A m(-2) was recorded at 1.0 V with hydrogen production rate of nearly 6.0 +/- 1.5 L m(-2) cathode day(-1). Trace amounts of methane, acetone and formate were detected in cathode's headspace and catholyte which followed the same trend as hydrogen production rate. Meanwhile substrate consumption in anolyte also followed the trend of hydrogen production and current density changes. The bioanode could utilise up to 95% of acetate in the tested voltage ranges, however, at a cell voltage of 2.0 V the bioanode's activity stopped due to oxygen evolution from water hydrolysis. Cyclic voltammograms revealed that the bioanode activity was vital to maintain the functionality of the whole system. The biocathode relied on the bioanode to maintain its potential during the hydrogen evolution. The overall energy efficiency recovered from both bioanode and external power in terms of hydrogen production at the cathode was determined as 29.4 +/- 9.0%, within which substrate oxidation contributed up to nearly 1/3 of the total energy marking the importance of bioanode recovering energy from wastewater to reduce the external power supply.

Photosynthetic electron transfer in chloroplasts isolated from pea leaves is suppressed by SkQ1 at micromolar concentrations: the electron transfer in chloroplasts under the action of photosystem II or I (with silicomolybdate or methyl viologen as electron acceptors, respectively) is more sensitive to SkQ1 than under the action of photosystem II + I (with ferricyanide or p-benzoquinone as electron acceptors). SkQ1 reduced by borohydride is oxidized by ferricyanide, p-benzoquinone, and, to a lesser extent, by silicomolybdate, but not by methyl viologen. SkQ1 is not effective as an electron acceptor supporting O-2 evolution from water in illuminated chloroplasts. The data on suppression of photosynthetic O-2 evolution or consumption show that SkQ1, similarly to phenazine methosulfate, causes conversion of the chloroplast redox-chain from non-cyclic electron transfer mode to the cyclic mode without O-2 evolution. Oxidation of NADH or succinate in mitochondria isolated from pea roots is stimulated by SkQ1.									4	0	1	0	4	0	5			0006-2979	1608-3040		WOS:000352819300004	25869358

Herein, a facile one-pot method is reported to synthesize PtCuRu nanoflowers (NFs). The synergetic effect among Pt, Cu, and Ru can lower the d-band center of Pt, regulate the morphology, generate Ru-rich edge, and allow the exposure of more high index facets. The optimized Pt0.68Cu0.18Ru0.14 NFs exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic performances and excellent anti-poisoning abilities. The specific activities for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) (7.65 mA cm(-2)) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) (7.90 mA cm(-2)) are 6.0 and 7.1 times higher than commercial Pt/C, respectively. The CO stripping experiment and the chronoamperometric (5000 s) demonstrate the superior anti-poisoning property and durability performance. Density functional theory calculations confirm that high metallization degree leads to the decrease of d-band center, the promotion of oxidation of CO, and improvement of the inherent activity and anti-poisoning ability. A Ru-rich edge exposes abundant high index facets to accelerate the reaction kinetics of rate-determining steps by decreasing the energy barrier for forming *HCOOH (MOR) and C-C bond breaking (EOR).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000870813300001	36269882

Especially, the history of aqueous battery systems with iron metal anode is overviewed from its earliest beginning to the new era, following by the discussion regarding the specialization of each system. We believe this review could bring the fundament of redox behavior for optimizing the iron metal anode and pave a way toward a reliable iron-based aqueous battery. (c) 2021 The Authors.

Different chloroauric acid to oxalic acid mixing ratios were studied and it was found that the 1 : 3 ratio gives better structures with high energy {110} facets, which are highly efficient for catalysis and metal enhanced fluorescence (MEF) activities because of the presence of many edges and corners. The reaction rate was also found to be fast at 50 degrees C compared to that under the ambient conditions. In the case of microwave (MW) heating, the control of the size and shape of Au NPs was better than that in hotplate heating. The MEF of rose bengal (RB) dye was found to be 5.0 times better for Au NPs synthesized at a 1 : 3 mixing ratio and under MW heating compared to spherical NPs. The same NPs were also found to have very good efficiency in metal enhanced singlet oxygen generation and catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1466-8033			WOS:000451158000012

In this work, we explored the electro-deposition of PbO2 on the Ti substrate with a Sb-doped SnO2 undercoat, from a traditional acidic nitrate solution. The morphology and microstructure of the PbO2 coatings were investigated by varying electro-deposition temperature and time. It is found that the Sb-doped SnO2 undercoat significantly promotes the electro-deposition process of PbO2. At a low electro-deposition temperature, a preferential crystallographic orientation is usually observed in the coatings, which exhibit a caterpillar-like morphology. At a higher deposition temperature, the PbO2 coatings display a more tightly packed pyramid-like morphology. The crystallite size increases with deposition temperature. Electrochemical performance of the deposited PbO2 largely depends on their morphologies and microstructures. It is suggested that deep reaction path, high porosity and good connectivity between crystallites play a synergic role in determining the electrochemical performance of the PbO2 coatings.

To determine whether hydrogen can account for a major part of the density deficit and is therefore an important constituent in the molten iron outer core, the hydrogen concentration in molten iron was measured at 7.5 gigapascals. From these measurements, the metal-silicate melt partitioning coefficient of hydrogen was determined as a function of temperature. If the magma ocean of primordial Earth was hydrous, more than 95 mole percent of H2O in this ocean should have reacted with iron to form FeHx, and about 60 percent of the density deficit is reconciled by adding hydrogen to the core.									165	4	3	0	13	0	168			0036-8075			WOS:A1997YJ90100043	9388177

Photocatalytic generation of hydrogen by these nanoparticles has been investigated under UV-Visible light irradiation. Na2S and Na2SO3 sacrificial agents dispersed with the photocatalyst are employed as hole scavengers. ZnO nanoparticles with smaller size shows better H-2 evolution rates up to 360 mu mol hg(-1).

The experiments show that the classical S(2) multiline signal is associated with a manganese environment which is not exposed to the aqueous medium. An electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy signal, also induced by 200 K illumination, showing (2)H modulation by methanol in the medium and a modified multiline Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy signal formed in parallel to it, are suggested to be associated with a second manganese environment exposed to the medium.

In a white dwarf ( Type Ia) supernova, the abundance determines, in part, the neutron-to-Ne-22 proton ratio and hence the abundance of radioactive Ni-56 that powers the light curve. The Ne-22 abundance also changes the burning rate and hence the laminar flame speed. We tabulate the flame speedup for different initial C-12 and Ne-22 abundances and for a range of densities. This increase in the laminar flame speed - about 30% for a Ne-22 mass fraction of 6% - affects the deflagration just after ignition near the center of the white dwarf, where the laminar speed of the flame dominates over the buoyant rise, and in regions of lower density, similar to 10(7) g cm(-3), where a transition to distributed burning is conjectured to occur. The increase in flame speed will decrease the density of any transition to distributed burning.									27	1	0	0	0	0	27			0004-637X			WOS:000243726100008		
J	Ruzicka, A								Growth of mineral zones by diffusion-controlled reactions: Theory and application to mesosiderites								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE				298	1			1	29		10.2475/ajs.298.1.1				JAN 1998	1998	The theory of Fisher (1973, 1977) and Joesten (1977) for the steady-state growth of mineral zones by diffusion-controlled reactions is modified to explicitly and formally account for polymineralic reactants, open-system diffusive fluxes, and diffusion geometry. The modifications are illustrated by applying the theory to olivine coronas in mesosiderite meteorites.Reactant composition strongly influences the growth of mineral zones and is embodied in the-layer-growth model presented here by so-called "residual-concentration-effect" terms or "R-terms." The open-system modification is similar to that developed by Ashworth and Birdi (1990), and the effect of diffusion geometry is handled by the introduction of a simple geometrical factor. Using the new formalism, this paper presents quantitative criteria for the stable growth of quasi-steady-state zone structures (Frantz and Mao, 1975) and analytic expressions for zone widths, zone modes, and the relative change in chemical potential of any locally buffered component in a mineral zone within a stable zone structure. It is shown that if one or both of the initial reactants are polymineralic, then it is possible for a mineral to disappear by reaction in one part of the zone sequence and to reappear by reaction in another part, and for a mineral to be stable to diffusion within a layer structure even though it is removed by the overall structure-forming reaction.The zone sequence, relative zone widths, and zone modes of olivine coronas in mesosiderites can be explained largely by layer growth models in which coupled reaction and diffusion occur between olivine and a polymineralic, mesosiderite-like matrix assemblage. A 5-component, closed system model is adequate to explain many features of coronas, and a 7-component, open-system model yields similar results to the 5-component model when open-system fluxes are small. Some constraints on Onsager diffusion (L-) coefficient ratios, reactions, and the magnitude of open-system fluxes appropriate to corona growth in mesosiderites can be obtained, but uncertainties in the values for open-system fluxes make it difficult to place tight constraints on L-coefficient ratios, and vice-versa For the Emery mesosiderite, it appears that P and Cr diffused into the coronas from a large volume of matrix, and that Fe diffused out of the coronas and into a large volume of matrix, during open-system diffusion. The combined effect of local reactions within coronas in Emery was to remove olivine, tridymite, plagioclase, metal, and clinopyroxene and to produce orthopyroxene, chromite, and merrillite. Most likely, metal was largely transferred from coronas to matrix by diffusional processes, and oxygen was supplied to coronas from the matrix.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0002-9599			WOS:000072213800001

This transformation, however, remains challenging and often requires either extensive optimization of the present chemical operating processes or, more importantly, the design and development of novel catalysts. In this paper, we achieve the confinement of uniform Au nanoparticles by using Silicalite-1 (Au@Silicalite-1) via an improved impregnation method for solvent-free oxidation of toluene by oxygen to benzaldehyde. In situ Ar+ etching XPS experiments revealed that in the evolution of Au-0 and Au3+ species in a single Au@Silicalite-1 crystal the proportion of the Au3+ species becomes enriched from 0 on the surface to >80% in the center. In the synergetic catalysis between Au-0 and Au3+ species, it was observed that the electron-rich Au-0 species activated oxygen to form superoxide anion radicals, while the electron-deficient Au3+ species promoted activation of the primary carbon-hydrogen bond in toluene and enabled efficient desorption of the desired product benzaldehyde with selectivity >90%. For comparison, Silicalite-1 or SiO2 supported Au-0-rich catalysts exhibited strong adsorption of benzaldehyde, generating overoxidized benzoic acid as the main product.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000656938300001

In the course of a running Miller-Urey-type experiment, a hydrophobic organic layer emerged besides the hydrophilic aqueous phase and the gaseous phase that were initially present. The gas phase mainly consisted of aromatic compounds and molecules containing CaeC or CaeN triple bonds. The hydrophilic phase contained at least a few thousands of different molecules, primarily distributed in a range of 50 and 500 Da. The hydrophobic phase is characterized by carbon-rich, oil-like compounds and their amphiphilic derivatives containing oxygen with tensioactive properties. The presence of a wide range of oxidized molecules hints to the availability of oxygen radicals. We suggest that they intervene in the formation of alkylated polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the oil/water interface. CARS spectroscopy revealed distinct vibrational molecular signatures. In particular, characteristic spectral bands for cyanide compounds were observed if the broth was prepared with electric discharges in the gaseous phase. The characteristic spectral bands were absent if discharges were released onto the water surface. NMR spectroscopy on the same set of samples independently confirmed the observation. In addition, NMR spectroscopy revealed overall high chemical variability that suggests strong non-linearities due to interdependent, sequential reaction steps.									9	0	0	0	4	0	9			0169-6149	1573-0875		WOS:000416449400001	27896547

Experimental measurements were supported by ray-tracing simulations of surface attached gas bubble films. A dilute, redox-active tracer allowed for the quantification of the mass-transport effects of bubble coverage during photoanodic O-2(g) evolution at upward-facing photoanodes in 1.0 M KOH(aq.). Measurements of the gas coverage at upward-facing p-Si photocathodes in 0.50 M H2SO4(aq.) allowed for the nucleation rate and contact angle of H-2(g) bubbles to be evaluated for systems having various surface free energies. Under simulated solar illumination, the rapid departure of small O-2(g) bubbles produced stable photocurrents at upward-facing oxygen-evolving Si photoanodes and yielded increased mass-transport velocities relative to a stagnant electrolyte, indicating that bubbles can provide a net benefit to the photoelectrochemical performance of an upward-facing photoanode in solar fuels devices.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000611850000020

The aim is to discover new pathways leading to the formation of toxic species in combustion systems, as well as compounds that may act as precursors for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD(F). The experiments were performed in a tubular reactor equipped with sampling systems for condensable and gaseous products. The reaction conditions were characterised by a residence time of 5 s and a fuel equivalence ratio of 0.12. We investigated the effect of temperature (400-800 degrees C) on the type and the yield of the oxidative products, trapped in a cartridge, and gases collected in tedlar bags for subsequent FUR analyses. The analyses of VOC, performed on a high resolution gas chromatograph-triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (HRGC-QQQMS), identified 2-methylbenzofuran and 3-hydro-2-methylenebenzofuran as the initial products. This has been confirmed by injection of authentic standards and the application of collision induced dissociation (CID) that fragmented the isolated parent ions into specific product ions affording the identification of parent species. The oxidative decomposition of DD initiated at around 450 C, with the evolution of VOC peaking at between 650 and 700 degrees C. In excess of 750 degrees C, all VOC were completely oxidised. The potential energy surface (PES), based on the density functional theory (DFT) of B3LYP, mapped the initial steps involved in the oxidation of DD, and yielded a detailed reaction scheme for the onset of oxidation of DD that results in the formation of 2-methylbenzofuran and 3-hydro-2-methylenebenzofuran. Initial oxidation of DD is most likely to commence via addition of the singlet oxygen molecule and the subsequent facile formation of the propagating OH radical. (c) 2012 The Combustion Institute.

Here, we report that 2D/2D layer heterostructures composed of exfoliated Ni-doped MoS2 nanosheets and g-C3N4 layers can carry out photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction in aqueous solutions with outstanding activity, exhibiting apparent QYs as high as 29.6 % and 23.7 % at 375 and 410 nm. We show that Ni doping of MoS2 markedly increases the photochemical activity, which, together with electrochemical, spectroscopic and theoretical DFT studies, arises from the enhanced carrier density and mobility at the Ni-MoS2/g-C3N4 interface. In addition to the favorable charge transport properties, delineation of the photoinduced oxidation reactions by gas monitoring techniques reveals that the high efficiency also arises from fast water oxidation kinetics. The results of this work mark an important step forward in understanding and designing low-cost and earth-abundant catalysts for detoxification of Cr(VI)-contaminated industrial effluents.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000697099100001

Here we report an aqueous route to the facile synthesis of Pd-M (M = Pd, Pt, and Au) decahedra covered with concave facets by controlling the deposition and diffusion of M atoms on Pd decahedral seeds. Our mechanistic studies indicate that the preferential deposition of M atoms on the twin boundaries of Pd decahedral seeds under limited surface diffusion is instrumental to their evolution into decahedra enclosed by concave facets. Due to the presence of high-index facets and twin boundaries on the surface, the Pd concave decahedra show enhanced catalytic activity towards formic acid oxidation. The present work not only offers a general route to the facile synthesis of decahedral nanocrystals with concave facets but also provides an additional knob for enhancing the catalytic performance of noble-metal nanocrystals.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1022-5528	1572-9028		WOS:000515877900001

Herein, we report that MoO2/BiOCl composites realized excellent photocatalytic nitrogen fixation efficiency when water was used proton source. The strong interaction between BiOCl nanoplates and MoO2 nanosheets regulated the electronic structure of the interface and provided active sites for the catalytic reaction. The Mo-O-Bi bonds formed at the interface of MoO2 and BiOCl worked as the bridge of electrons, facilitating the separation and migration of photo-generated charge carriers. In addition, the interface of MoO2/BiOCl composite also promoted the adsorption and activation of N-2, substantially enhanced N-2 reduction. As a result, ammonia production rate of 35 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) was achieved, which is 8-fold higher than that of pristine BiOCl and 6-fold higher than that of MoO2. This work presents a feasible route to design the nanocomposites with better performance for photocatalytic nitrogen fixation.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000499025000001

Recent studies show that one of the main bottlenecks in the implementation of non-oxide systems to water splitting is the low number of active metal sites, which is in the order of nmol cm(-2). Herein, a new series of non-oxide water-oxidation catalysts has been introduced to the field. Cobalt dicyanamides are observed to have around four times higher surface active sites and better catalytic performances than cyanide-based systems. Long-term catalytic studies (70 h) at an applied potential of 1.2 V and electrochemical studies performed in solutions in pH values of 3.0-12.0 indicate that the compounds are robust and retain their structures even under harsh conditions. Moreover, the addition of Ni impurities to cobalt dicyanamides is a feasible method to improve their catalytic activities.									16	1	1	0	0	0	17			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000395798300012

The electro-decomposition of organics is strongly dependent on the properties of anode materials. SnO2-Sb2O5 composites are considered to be promising anode materials for use in oxidizing agents due to their low cost and high overpotential for oxygen evolution reactions (OER). In this work, SnO2-Sb2O5 catalyst composites on Ti substrates (Ti/SnO2-Sb2O5) synthesized via sol-gel and thermal spray coating methods were studied for wastewater treatment in an attempt to develop an electrode with a high electrochemical activity and enhanced stability. The physicochemical properties of the as-synthesized samples were investigated via X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As an anode material for the electro-degradation of organic matter, Ti/SnO2-Sb2O5 catalysts play an important role in producing active hydroxyl radicals and retaining their original structure, consequently leading to high electrocatalytic performance in the presence of chloride.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1533-4880	1533-4899		WOS:000387100600138

Herein, composite photocatalysts with bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) and sulfur-doped graphitic carbon nitride (SCN) are developed by using a one-pot impregnated precipitation method. Fourier transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses demonstrate that the surface of SCN is oxidized during impregnation and the oxidized surface becomes the synthetic site for BiVO4 composition. Among the composites with various ratios, the B7S catalyst, which is our best achievement, shows an oxygen evolution rate of 750 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) that is >2-fold higher than that of pristine BiVO4 (i.e., 328 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) under identical reaction conditions [0.05 M AgNO3 aqueous solution under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 rim)]. The photonic efficiency of B7S is also measured as 19%. The mechanism behind this is the enhanced charge carrier lifetime of B7S (3.14 ns), which is lengthened up to 4 times compared to that of BiVO4 (0.70 ns) because of the facilitated charge separation through the composite.									179	9	0	0	17	0	182			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000371852000011

However, it remains difficult to design an efficient electrocatalyst with explicit structure-property relationships. Herein, we report a single-atom bismuth (Bi)-doping strategy to endow Co3O4 with enhanced activity and selectivity toward electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR). Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that single-atom Bi substitutes cobalt at octahedral sites (CoOh3+) in Co3O4, facilitating the generation of reactive hydroxyl species (OH*) at adjacent tetrahedral Co sites (CoTd2+). Mechanism studies demonstrate that OH* accelerates the oxidation of hydroxyl groups and carbon-carbon (C-C) bond cleavage, achieving GOR activity (400 mA cm-2 at 1.446 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) and high faradaic efficiency of formate (97.05 +/- 2.55%). Our study shows a promising way to promote the electro-oxidation activity of spinel oxides for biomass valorization by a single-atom doping strategy.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000863670200001

Worldwide, researchers and companies are continuously working on this matter, taking one of two approaches: either finding new energy sources or improving the efficiency of existing ones. Hydrogen is a well-known energy carrier due to its high energy content, but a somewhat elusive one for being a gas with low molecular weight. This review examines the current electrolysis processes for obtaining hydrogen, with an emphasis on alkaline water electrolysis. This process is far from being new, but research shows that there is still plenty of room for improvement. The efficiency of an electrolyzer mainly relates to the overpotential and resistances in the cell. This work shows that the path to better electrolyzer efficiency is through the optimization of the cell components and operating conditions. Following a brief introduction to the thermodynamics and kinetics of water electrolysis, the most recent developments on several parameters (e.g., electrocatalysts, electrolyte composition, separator, interelectrode distance) are highlighted.									11	1	0	0	1	0	11				1996-1073		WOS:000659846000001

Such functionalities are intimately tied with the modular MOF chemistry required for the delineation of the wide range of tunable porous structures constructed from various electrooptically active linkers and or metal nodes. Various post-synthesis approaches further facilitate incorporation of key chemical functionalities that cannot be introduced into MOFs directly via de novo syntheses. While the tunable frameworks can provide a high areal concentration of electrooptically active species, the pore channels ensure substrate and ion flux, making these compositions highly accessible solid arrangements of molecular catalysts ideal for electro- and photoelectro chemical transformations. The recent surge of literature reports suggests unique features of energy and electron transfer processes within these framework compositions. Thus, understanding the unique features of electron transfer processes within the frameworks will help to delineate strategies for future functional materials. This review highlights some exemplary MOFs' electrocatalysis to understand the interplay between catalytic and ET processes.									9	1	0	0	1	0	9			0260-3594	1548-9574		WOS:000452780200001

The coatings were prepared by thermal decomposition of a mixture of H2IrCl6 center dot 6H(2)O dissolved in hydrochloric acid and TaCl5 dissolved in alcohol. Surface morphology, microstructure, matter phase, electrochemical properties and accelerated life of the anodes were observed and examined. Compared with the anode without its substrate treated, the anodes with the substrates oxalic acid etched and hydrogen treated at 300 degrees C, 400 degrees C, 500 degrees C and 600 degrees C respectively show better electro-catalytic performance and longer life. However, effects of two methods are different. Oxalic acid etching of the substrate, which could get better improvement at accelerated life, while hydrogen treatment of the substrates, which could get better improvement at the electro-catalytic performance. Especially, anode with 400 degrees C hydrogen treated substrate has the highest electro-catalytic activity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Conflicting data exist on whether exposure to sun or artificial UV sources may deplete the levels of blood folate in humans. Blood contains several photosensitizers and proteins, as well as antioxidants, which when exposed to UV radiation and visible light may be involved in the degradation of folate. In this study the photodegradation of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5MTHF) in aqueous and deuterious solutions exposed to UVB, UVA, or visible light in the absence or presence of riboflavin, uroporphyrin, and conjugated bilirubin was investigated by absorption spectroscopy. 5MTHF is stable under exposure to visible light and UVA radiation, whereas it is slowly photooxidized under UVB exposure. However, it is rapidly oxidized by UVA or visible radiation in the presence of riboflavin or uroporphyrin, but not in the presence of conjugated bilirubin, which acts in a protective manner. Reactive oxygen species produced in type I and/or type II reactions were involved. This study suggests that 5MTHF in blood can be photodegraded in the presence of the flavins and porphyrins, but protected by bilirubins. This may have health and evolutionary implications.

J	Hong, SK; Pawlikowski, SA; Vander Meulen, KA; Yocum, CF								The oxidation state of the photosystem II manganese cluster influences the structure of manganese stabilizing protein								BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-BIOENERGETICS				1504	2-3			262	274		10.1016/S0005-2728(00)00255-3				APR 2 2001	2001	Exposure of photosystem II membranes to trypsin that has been treated to inhibit chymotrypsin activity produces limited hydrolysis of manganese stabilizing protein. Exposure to chymotrypsin under the same conditions yields substantial digestion of the protein. Further probing of the unusual insensitivity of manganese stabilizing protein to trypsin hydrolysis reveals that increasing the temperature from 4 to 25 degreesC will cause some acceleration in the rate of proteolysis. However, addition of low (100 muM) concentrations of NH2OH, that are sufficient to reduce, but not destroy, the photosystem II Mn cluster, causes a change in PS II-bound manganese stabilizing protein that causes it to be rapidly digested by trypsin. Immunoblot analyses with polyclonal antibodies directed against the N-terminus of the protein, or against the entire sequence show that trypsin cleavage produces two distinct peptide fragments estimated to be in the 17-20 kDa range, consistent with proposals that there are 2 mol of the protein/mol photosystem II. The correlation of trypsin sensitivity with Mn redox state(s) in photosystem II suggest that manganese stabilizing protein may interact either directly with Mn, or alternatively, that the polypeptide is bound to another protein of the photosystem II reaction center that is intimately involved in binding and redox activity of Mn.

The results showed that the reduction of fluorine content would promote the replacement of F in [SiF6]-octahedral unit by the dissociative free oxygen ions (O2-), and release F- ions into the melt to compensate the reduction of F- ions. With the 2 mass% addition of B2O3, the original Si-O-Si bond would be disrupted, and connect with [BO3]-trihedral to form boroxol ring structure containing [BO2O-]-trihedral and [BO3]-trihedral structural units. Then, the Si-O-B bond that [BO3]-trihedral links [SiO4]-tetrahedral in boroxol ring was destroyed with the further addition of B2O3, and then the [BO3]-trihedral could link with the dissociative Q(1)(Si) and Q(0)(Si) structural units to transform into [BO4]-tetrahedral and form a borosilicate long chain. Finally, with 6 mass% addition of B2O3, the borosilicate chain would combine with simple borate and borosilicate structures, and a complex borosilicate structure containing boroxol ring with certain symmetry was formed ultimately. Besides, the calculated result of DOP suggested that the DOP of the melt structure improved during the process of fluorine replacement by B2O3.									22	0	0	0	2	0	22			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000480105700001

Exploring stable and high-efficiency electrocatalysts is of vital importance for the promotion of these technologies. Single-atom catalysts (SACs), with atomically distributed active sites on supports, perform as emerging materials in catalysis and present promising prospects for a wide range of applications. The rationally designed near-range coordination environment, long-range electronic interaction and microenvironment of the coordination sphere cast huge influence on the reaction mechanism and related catalytic performance of SACs. In the current Review, some recent developments of atomically dispersed reactive centers for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction and water splitting are well summarized. The catalytic mechanism and the underlying structure-activity relationship are elaborated based on the recent progresses of various operando investigations. Finally, by highlighting the challenges and prospects for the development of single-atom catalysis, we hope to shed some light on the future research of SACs for the electrocatalytic energy conversion.									70	4	0	0	2	0	70			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000621045000001	33314631

However, different active sites are required for bifunctional electrocatalysts, increasing the complexity of electrocatalyst construction. In this study, a bifunctional electrocatalyst (denoted as CoP-NPC) which consists of CoP nanocubes and Co-N-C sites embedded on the N,P co-doped carbon matrix is synthesized by a pyrolysis-phosphorization approach of the composite of the CoCo-Prussian blue analogue (CoCo-PBA), graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (GCNS), polydopamine (PDA) and sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2). The phosphorization process induces the synergism of CoP, Co-N-C, and NPC, providing abundant and efficient catalytically active sites. As a result, the CoP-NPC displays significant improvement in electrocatalytic activities with a half-wave potential of 0.821 V and a low overpotential of 308 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the ORR and OER. Moreover, the CoP-NPC material exhibits outstanding stability and tolerance to methanol. This study provides a facile phosphating strategy to simultaneously boost the catalytic activity of bifunctional electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2398-4902			WOS:000534220100029

Recently, the resurrected ancestors of drug-metabolizing P450s were shown to be highly thermostable and expressed in high yield, while retaining similar substrate specificity to the extant forms. However, they still rely on NADPH and cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) to enable catalysis of oxidative transformations. To identify an alternative support system, we screened 10 oxygen surrogates (OSs) for the ability to support P450 ancestors from three different families. Of the 23 ancestors examined, 17 were supported by at least one OS as well as, or better than, by CPR. Using two candidate P450s we showed that OS-dependent P450 catalysis can be optimized in a few steps, boosting product yield from similar to 2.2 % with CPR to 88-100 % with an OS. The principles applied here will facilitate faster evaluation and optimization of OS-supported P450 catalysis versus redox partner-dependent P450 catalysis.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000514206500001

Practical, experimentally accessible, yet general predictors of catalytic OER activity have remained scarce. This study investigates iridium and iridium-nickel thin film model electrocatalysts for the OER and identifies a set of general ex situ properties that allow the reliable prediction of their OER activity. Well-defined Ir-based catalysts of various chemical nature and composition were synthesized by magnetron sputtering. Correlation of physicochemical and electrocatalytic properties revealed two experimental OER activity descriptors that are able to predict trends in the OER activity of unknown Ir-based catalyst systems. More specifically, our study demonstrates that the IrIII+- and OH-surface concentration of the oxide catalyst constitute closely correlated and generally applicable OER activity predictors. On the basis of these predictors, an experimental volcano relationship of Ir-based OER electrocatalysts is presented and discussed.									83	3	0	0	3	0	83			2155-5435			WOS:000480503700006

In general, overall water splitting over a photocatalyst particle can be achieved by modifying the photocatalyst with a suitable cocatalyst to provide an active redox site. Therefore, the development of active photocatalytic materials has relied on both photocatalysts and cocatalysts.

Influence of substitution of Ru on the electrocatalytic properties of the perovskite-type LaSrNiO4 electrode towards methanol oxidation								INDIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY SECTION A-INORGANIC BIO-INORGANIC PHYSICAL THEORETICAL & ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				47	8			1187	1193						AUG 2008	2008	Ru-substituted perovskite oxides with molecular formulae LaSrNi1-xRuxO4 (0.1 <= x <= 0.5) have been obtained by a modified, citric acid sol-gel route at 600 degrees C for their possible use as anodes in a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). These oxides have been as film on a nickel support and investigated for electrocatalysis of methanol oxidation in 1 M KOH using XRD, SEM, cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, impedance and Tafel polarization. The study shows that 0.2-0.5 mol Ru substitutions improve the apparent electrocatalytic activity of the oxide towards electrooxidation of methanol; the observed improvement being the greatest (similar to 80% at E = 0.55 V versus Hg/HgO) with 0.2 mol RU substitution. During a chronoamperometric study of 5 h at E= 0.5 V in 1M KOH + 1M CH3OH, the Ru-substituted electrodes did not indicate any poisoning by the methanol oxidation intermediates/products. The methanol electrooxidation reaction follows a Tafel slope of similar to 40 mV decade(-1) and the order with respect to [OH] is 'similar to 2 on each electrocatalyst, regardless of the Ru content.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0376-4710	0975-0975		WOS:000258640900003

CHARACTERIZATION OF THE RHYTHM AND THE BLUE-LIGHT RESPONSE								PLANTA				187	1			53	59		10.1007/BF00201623				APR 1992	1992	The photosynthetic oxygen production of Ectocarpus siliculosus (Dillwyn) Lyngb. under continuous high irradiances of red light displayed a circadian rhythm with maxima at about noon. Pulses of blue light induced rapid transient increases in the rate of photosynthesis. The increases started about 15 s after the beginning of blue light and reached their maxima after 3-4 min. This was followed by a gradual decrease. A second peak or shoulder about 20 min later indicated that at least two reactions were involved in the blue-light enhancement of photosynthesis. The magnitude of the response to blue light depended on the phase of the rhythm at which blue light was given. It was high when the red-light photosynthesis was at its troughs, and low at its peaks. Fluence-response curves indicated that the sensitivity to blue light at the peaks of the rhythm was identical to that at the troughs. In addition, blue light shifted the phase of the photosynthetic rhythm, where the essential trigger was the light-off signal. Red light had no specific influence on the circadian rhythm. After darkness, photosynthetic rates were different from those under steady-state conditions. Two different transient bursts in the rate of O2 evolution could be distinguished, an early non-rhythmical one that was probably caused by accumulation of inorganic carbon inside the cells, and a second later one that appeared at the peak activity phases of the ciradian rhythm or after blue light. Its origins are unclear.									31	0	0	0	28	0	31			0032-0935			WOS:A1992HN02300007	24177966

The high-efficiency electrochemical conversion of CO2 to single-carbon products has been well realized, while more efforts are needed for the generation of high-value multicarbon products. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), featuring porous structures, high chemical tunability, and ultralarge surface area, have attracted increasing attention in the electrochemical CO2RR.

Then, the electrocatalytic CO2RR performance and the corresponding catalytic mechanism of pristine MOFs (classified according to the kind of organic ligands/linkers) and MOF-derived materials (including metal nanomaterials, single-atom catalysts and nanocomposites) toward the multicarbon product generation are systematically discussed.

Such features limit their photoelectrochemical activity. Herein, we report the synthesis of ternary heterostructures comprising ZnO nanorods (NRs) and ZnS nanoparticles wrapped in MoS2 nanosheets (ZnO/ZnS/MoS2, ZSM) directly grown on a substrate by a low-cost hydrothermal route and their performance as anodes for photo electrochemical water splitting. The ZSM heterostructures exhibit a sixfold photocurrent density of 0.72 mA cm(-2), a fourfold maximum applied bias photon to-current efficiency of 0.28% compared to bare ZnO NRs, and excellent photostability. These improvements in the overall photoelectrochemical activity are due to enhanced light absorption in the visible light range, higher surface active sites, and efficient charge separation enabled by the introduction of a ZnS/MOS2 coating. Our study demonstrates an alternative architecture design of ternary heterostructures with increased photoelectrochemical activity. In general, this approach of constructing a double heterojunction can also be extended to other materials with similar architectures.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2574-0970		WOS:000818759500001

Electrocatalysts with a highly porous structure have been extensively studied in the field of electrochemistry, owing to their large catalytically active area and favorable mass transfer. Therefore, in this thesis, a one-step galvanostatic electrodeposition method related to the hydrogen evolution reaction is adopted to deposit a porous silver film on Ti foil (Ag/Ti). Electrochemical measurements are introduced to estimate the ability of the resultant Ag/Ti electrode to catalyze hydrazine electrooxidation. Ag/Ti displays an evident peak at approximately -0.2 V due to hydrazine electrooxidation. The correspondent peak current density reaches 7.7 mA cm(-2) in 0.02 M N2H4 center dot H2O and 1.0 M KOH. This good electrocatalytic capacity may have a bearing on the micropore structure, which offers facile access of the electrolyte to the Ag/Ti surfaces and enables gases to diffuse away from the electrode surfaces promptly to vacate the activated sites.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1452-3981			WOS:000419169900063

In the combustion experiment, such combustion parameters as bed temperature, supplied oxygen concentration and char type were varied. The change of gas species concentration and compositions in the burning char were analyzed during the char combustion process.In the initial stage of char combustion NO was produced rapidly, but N2O concentration increased slowly. This result is caused by N2O destruction due to H radical, which is produced from the oxidation of CO. In the latter half of combustion, however, N2O concentration increased faster since the formation rate of H radical decreased. The N2O concentration increased with decreasing bed temperature and with increasing supplied O2 concentration. This tendency is similar to that in the volatile combustion. From chemical and physical analyses of the burning char particles, the evolution behavior of N-component is influenced by the difference in surface and internal structures (network or balloon type) during the char combustion.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0386-216X			WOS:A1994PA45600004

All the experimental samples formed a single-phase structure, and no structural transformation occurred within the experimental doping range; however, Ti doping caused lattice shrinkage. Ti doping reduced the grain size, and the microstructure of the synthesized samples appeared more compact in scanning electron microscopy images. The lattice distortion of GdMn(1-x)TixO3 caused by Ti substitution at the Mn sites resulted in changes in the Raman vibration modes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results showed that the valence state transition of the Ti and Mn ions occurred and the concentration of Ti4+, Mn3+ ions and oxygen vacancies changed due to the charge compensation induced by Ti doping. Ti doping had a significant influence on the size and concentration of cation vacancies in the GdMn(1-x)TixO3 samples. Appropriate Ti doping was shown to reduce the dielectric loss, improve the frequency stability of the dielectric constant, and significantly affect the long-range ordering of Gd3+ magnetic moments and clearly reduce magnetization.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000701382600001

Here, a photoanode of WO3/Fe2O3 heterojunction decorated by NiFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH) was fabricated by two-step hydrothermal methods. As expected, the photocurrent density of the ternary photoanode reaches up to 3.0 mA.cm(-2), which respectively are 5 times and 7 times of WO3 and alpha-Fe2O3. The improvement benefits from the extending absorption of visible light, the effective separation of photogenerated charge carriers, and acceleration of water oxidizing reaction, which is caused by narrowing band gap and electron directionally flowing of heterojunction as well as catalyst timely consuming of holes accumulated at the electrode surface. The electron lifetime and the steady-state carrier density for four photoanodes were estimated from electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and were further confirmed by the intensity modulated photocurrent spectra (IMPS). The work provides a demonstration to develop a high efficiency and low-cost photoanode for application in solar energy PEC water splitting.									69	4	0	0	4	0	69			2168-0485			WOS:000446413100038

The thicknesses for a series of films, which were systematically varied from 10 to 400 nm using photodeposition techniques, were accurately measured by cross-sectional SEM using a protocol that successfully resolves the relevant catalyst layers. XRF measurements recorded on each of the films provided a strong linear correlation (R-2 > 0.97) with the thicknesses determined by cross-sectional SEM. The electrochemical surface areas (ECSAs) determined by double-layer capacitance measurements, a technique widely used in the electrocatalysis community, showed a linear relationship for iridium oxide film thicknesses but not with those consisting of nickel and iron. These results highlight the limitations of using ECSA to determine catalyst film thicknesses and metal loadings. The noninvasive XRF technique is demonstrated to be a far superior method for reporting on the thickness and loadings of thin metal oxide films.									11	1	0	0	2	0	11			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000410868600029

Developing of artificial catalyst with similar, active center structure and functions is still one of main objectives in photocatalyst study for energy storage and conversion. In the present study, we prepared Fe2S2 nanocluster with doped Ni which possess similar active center to the center in [FeFe]-hydrogenases (the similar Fe-Fe bond length (2.60 angstrom), Fe-S-Fe bond angle and mbssbauer effect) for water splitting. Electrochemical measurements showed that the catalyst exhibited low onset potential about 30 mV and overpotential of similar to 0.12 V at 10 mA/cm(2) for hydrogen generation. Besides, by fabricated an artificial gill, Ni-doped Fe2S2 composite (AG-NFG) photocatalytic system performed significant enhanced activity for H-2 generation from pure water under visible light irradiation (lambda >= 420 nm) without the use of sacrificial reagents.

In the present work, a (TiO2/RuO2)/PTFE gas diffusion electrode (GDE) was designed for use in the electrochemical conversion of ethylene into ethylene glycol under conditions of simultaneous oxygen evolution. The GDE was produced by pressing and sintering TiO2(0,7)/RuO2(0,3) powder and PTFE and used in the electrosynthesis of ethylene glycol. In the experiments, ethylene was inserted in the reaction medium by the GDE and electrosynthesis was carried out in 0.1 mol L-1 Na2SO4 supporting electrolyte. A solution of 330 mg L-1 of ethylene glycol was obtained in 20 min with the application of 0.7 mA cm(-2). During the experiments, the current efficiency was 70% and energy consumption was <1 kWh kg(-1) of ethylene glycol. Mass spectrometry data also indicated the formation of ethanol in average concentrations of 5% of the ethylene glycol concentration.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000301929000004

The full Navier-Stokes equations are solved along with the species continuity equations. A recent method is used to compute chemical equilibria and the coupling between chemistry and thermodynamics is treated according to a new strategy. The particular boundaries, which are the combustion zone of the propellant and the outflow section, require an original treatment by solving a set of 'full' or 'half' Riemann problems taking into account the transport of chemical species. The SOLA-ICE algorithm is successfully developed for the reactive-diffusive case dealing with particular boundaries. A fire of a standard hot homogeneous propellant in a rectangular cavity initially filled with air is simulated for two opening conditions of the safety-vent. They predict the increase in the rates of energy release and CO2/H2O production in the reaction zone caused by afterburning processes involving the air of the enclosure. The course of the compartment fire is described in terms of time evolution of the average gas temperature and pressure, and oxygen depletion for both opening configurations.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			0017-9310			WOS:A1996TG99300012

The specific interaction among Co, Fe and V is systematically revealed via tuning the molar ratios of M2+:M3+ and Fe3+:V3+ in these tri-metallic LDHs. Finally, the optimal synergistic effect is reached when the molar ratios of M2+:M3+ and Fe3+:V3+ are respectively 4:1 and 1:1, resulting in the product named Co8FeV@CC, which displays the best overall OER and HER performance. Only rather low overpotentials of 235 and 182 mV are required to attain the current density of 100 mA cm-2 with a Faradaic efficiency of nearly 100 % for OER and HER, respectively. Co8FeV@CC can thus be applied as both an anode and cathode in the symmetrical two-electrode and possesses a current density of 100 mA cm-2 at the cell voltage of 1.65 V, and further demonstrates ultra-high stability for 100 h.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000696918200001

This strategy utilizes abundant saline water as an electrolyte and source of oxygen atoms for functionalization. We present a mechanistic study of ethylene oxidation in saline water using cobalt oxide nanoparticle catalysts. Electrochemical kinetic analysis and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy suggest that the resting state of the catalyst and the rate-determining step differ for the chlorine evolution reaction in the presence and absence of ethylene. In 0.6 M NaCl pH 8 electrolyte, which resembles seawater, the average current density was similar to 60 mA/cm(2) with a Faradaic efficiency of similar to 41% toward ethylene functionalization. The use of synthetic and natural seawater achieved Faradaic efficiencies above 70%, while the partial current toward the product remained invariant. Further conversion of the initial product 2-chloroethanol into ethylene glycol was also demonstrated. We present a broader vision of harnessing saline water in electrochemical functionalization of organic molecules and coproduction of hydrogen.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000598140200025

The crystalline size and morphology could be easily controlled by simply modulating the amount of NaOH mineralizer added and reactant precursors. The crystal composition, morphology and crystal structures of the samples were systematically analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Moreover, the chemical states, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and thermal stability of the CuCoO2 samples (ca. 150 nm) were systemically characterized. We believe that our synthesis strategy will open a new route for the preparation and application of CuCoO2, which involves combining the advantages of ZIF-67 and various components or structures. Furthermore, the resulting CuCoO2 nanoplates can serve as a potential candidate for a cost-effective and active electrode material.									11	1	0	0	1	0	11			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000488843000019

We model the solar-to-fuel (STF) efficiencies using realistic parameters based on recently reported CO2 reduction catalysts with a high performance tandem photoabsorber structure. CO and formate, which are both two-electron reduction products, offer STF efficiencies (20.0% and 18.8%) competitively close to that of solar H-2 (21.8%) despite markedly worse reduction catalysis. The slightly lower efficiency toward carbon products is mainly due to electrolyte resistance, not overpotential. Using a cell design where electrolyte resistance is minimized makes formate the preferred product from an efficiency standpoint (reaching 22.7% STF efficiency). On the other hand, going beyond a 2 electron reduction reaction, the more highly reduced products seem unviable with presently available electrocatalysts due to excessive overpotentials and poor selectivity. This work considers breaking up the multielectron reduction pathway into individually optimized, separate two electron steps as a way forward.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000391080900002

Herein, we firstly propose the feasily obtained rhombohedral corundum/cubic In2O3 (rh/c-In2O3) phase-junction by direct annealing metal organic framework (MIL-68(In)-NH2) in air atmosphere. The spectroscopic characterization and photo-electrochemistry test indicate that this special phase-junction could effectively accelerate the separation and transfer of photogenerated charges between rh-In2O3 and c-In2O3. The optimal In2O3 phase-junction shows hydrogen production rate of 2244 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) in 15 vol % triethanolamine aqueous solution, corresponding to the apparent quantum yields of 35 % at 400 nm, is approximately 12 times higher than that of bare c-In2O3. The results of vitro cytotoxicity assay and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation suggest that In2O3 samples are safety photocatalysts to environment and human being. The Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and experiment results manifest the photo-induced electron transfer from c-In2O3 to rh-In2O3 with a Z-scheme mechanism. This work not only reports a novel Z-scheme phase-junction photocatalysts but also provides an idea for the design of environmentally friendly photocatalysts for water splitting hydrogen production.									27	2	0	0	1	0	27			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000591694700006

The cyclization mechanism and stabilization behavior of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) were discussed. In N-2 flow, it was found that AM had the ability to initiate and accelerate cyclization process, which was confirmed by the fact that the initiation of nitriles shifted to a lower temperature. Compared to AN homopolymer, the initiation temperature of cyclization was ahead 32 K by introducing 3.59 mol% AM into the copolymer. The exothermic reaction was relaxed due to the presence of two separated exothermic peaks. Accompanied by DSC, in situ FTIR and calculation of activation energy, the two peaks were proved to be caused by ionic cyclization and free radical cyclization, respectively, and the corresponding cyclization mechanism was proposed. With increasing in AM content, the ionic cyclization tends to be dominant and the total heat liberated first increases and then decreases. For AN homopolymer, the activation energy of cyclization is 179 kJ/mol. For AN-AM copolymer (containing 3.59 mol% AM), the activation energy of ionic cyclization is 96 kJ/mol and that of free radical cyclization is 338 kJ/mol. In air flow, similar cyclization routes occur and the difference is the contribution of oxidation. The oxygen in environment has no remarkable effect on cyclization of AN homopolymer but retards the cyclization of AN-AM copolymers. For AN-AM copolymer with 3.59 mol% AM, the cyclization temperature is postponed 10 degrees C in air.									10	5	0	0	0	0	11			0256-7679	1439-6203		WOS:000279111400010

Therefore, RSEs, such as Mo, U, and V, are extensively used to indicate redox states in marine environments. To retrieve the historical redox state in the hypoxic zone near the Changjiang River Estuary and its adjacent waters, the distribution and enrichment degree of Mo, U, and V in a sediment core collected from the recurrently hypoxic region were investigated. The correlation analysis shows that the authigenic enrichment of Mo and U in sediment core 3,050-2 is primarily controlled by redox conditions, rather than sediment grain size, adsorption on organic matters, Fe-Mn (hydr)oxides, and terrigenous detritus input. Mo-U covariation is selected to analyze the evolution of redox conditions in the seasonally hypoxic zone. The Mo-EF/U-EF values in this sediment core are almost between 0.1 and 0.3xMo/U-modern seawater value and show a general decreasing trend with depth, indicating an overall progressive transition from oxic to suboxic conditions in this area since 2005. The close Mo-EF/U-EF values and similar chronological Mo-U variations by comparing our results with previous studies in adjacent areas offer common evidence for the gradually intensified bottom water-oxygen stress, suggesting the possible application of Mo-EF/U-EF in retrieving redox development in this coastal hypoxic zone.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2296-6463		WOS:000805869200001		
J	Laakso, Thomas A.; Schrag, Daniel P.								The role of authigenic carbonate in Neoproterozoic carbon isotope excursions								EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS				549						116534	10.1016/j.epsl.2020.116534				NOV 1 2020	2020	Sedimentary carbonates from the Neoproterozoic Era host some of the largest carbon isotope excursions in the geological record, in some cases as large as 12 parts per thousand to 15 parts per thousand. The origin of these signals remains a matter of debate - including whether they reflect local diagenetic effects, or record changes in the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) of global seawater that are indicative of shifts in the larger carbon cycle. Producing such changes through oxidation of organic carbon or methane requires unreasonably large fluxes that imply massive perturbations to carbon and oxygen budgets that are not observed. We present a plausible way to drive large changes in the delta C-13 of the global ocean via large-scale precipitation of isotopically fractionated authigenic carbonates distributed globally at modest concentrations in terrigenous sediments, particularly if the isotopic fractionation of authigenic carbonate shifts rapidly relative to average marine carbonate. We suggest that changes in the fractionation associated with authigenic carbonate precipitation could therefore be responsible for at least some of the variability in isotopic records drawn from primary marine carbonate. Using a diffusion-reaction model, we find that oscillations in sulfate concentrations are one mechanism for altering the isotopic composition of authigenic carbonates, thus forcing abrupt changes in seawater delta C-13. This mechanism is particularly effective under the geochemical conditions that likely prevailed during the Neoproterozoic.

J	Hajian, Mahmood; Mirbagheri, Seyed Ahmad; Javid, Amir Hosein								Comparison of classical Fenton and Fenton-like using mu-ZVI processes for the degradation of cresol in the wastewater								DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT				109				132	138		10.5004/dwt.2018.21836				MAR 2018	2018	The aim of this study was to investigate the applicability of a Fenton-like process using micron size zero valent iron (mu-ZVI) catalyst for the degradation of cresol in the wastewater, and the comparison of the degradation and the detoxification of cresol through this method and the classical Fenton process. The experiments were conducted in a batch reactor to examine the effects of pH, ZVI concentration, hydrogen peroxide concentration and temperature on the degradation of a wastewater containing 18.5 mM tricresol. The optimal reacting conditions were found to be pH = 2, [ZVI] = 5.35 g/L, [H2O2] = 472 mM and temperature = 30 degrees C. The optimum conditions of the Fenton-like process were affected by corrosion phenomena and were different from the classical Fenton process. The evolutions of pH, cresol concentration, products concentration, dissolved iron concentration and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal at the optimum conditions during the process were determined. At t = 120 min the efficiency of the degradation reaction reached at the maximum level (87.7%). The degradation efficiency obtained by the Fenton-like process is significantly higher in comparison with that achieved by the classical Fenton process (81.6%) at its optimum conditions. 85.8% of ZVI was recoverable by filtration after each experiment. The reusability of the recovered catalysts was also determined in 10 repetitive cycles (average degradation efficiency = 87.46%). Finally, bioassay tests for initial and treated wastewaters were conducted to evaluate their phytotoxicity on Lepidium sativum L. The phytotoxicity results were found to be in good accordance with the COD removals.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			1944-3994	1944-3986		WOS:000445122200014

The deregulation of iron homeostasis due to gene defects or environmental stresses leads to a wide range of diseases with consequences for cellular metabolism that remain poorly understood. The modelling of iron homeostasis in relation to the main features of metabolism, energy production and oxidative stress may provide new clues to the ways in which changes in biological processes in a normal cell lead to disease.Results: Using a methodology based on probabilistic Boolean modelling, we constructed the first model of yeast iron homeostasis including oxygen-related reactions in the frame of central metabolism. The resulting model of 642 elements and 1007 reactions was validated by comparing simulations with a large body of experimental results ( 147 phenotypes and 11 metabolic flux experiments). We removed every gene, thus generating in silico mutants. The simulations of the different mutants gave rise to a remarkably accurate qualitative description of most of the experimental phenotype (overall consistency > 91.5%). A second validation involved analysing the anaerobiosis to aerobiosis transition. Therefore, we compared the simulations of our model with different levels of oxygen to experimental metabolic flux data. The simulations reproducted accurately ten out of the eleven metabolic fluxes. We show here that our probabilistic Boolean modelling strategy provides a useful description of the dynamics of a complex biological system. A clustering analysis of the simulations of all in silico mutations led to the identification of clear phenotypic profiles, thus providing new insights into some metabolic response to stress conditions. Finally, the model was also used to explore several new hypothesis in order to better understand some unexpected phenotypes in given mutants.Conclusions: All these results show that this model, and the underlying modelling strategy, are powerful tools for improving our understanding of complex biological problems.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5				1752-0509		WOS:000291878400001	21489274

Herein, a hybrid measurement technique using ellipsometry together with other independent methods for validation, is demonstrated. Ellipsometry provides information about the porosity of different mesoporous films (PtRuNP/OMC = 45%; IrOx = 46%) as well as about the pore size (pore radius of approximate to 5 nm for PtRuNP/OMC). In addition, the electronic structure of a material, such as intraband transitions of a mesoporous IrOx film, can be identified, which can be used to better understand the mechanisms of chemical processes. In addition, it is shown that ellipsometry can be used as a scalable imaging and visualization method for quality assurance in production. These require accurate and traceable measurements, with reference materials playing an important role that include porosity and other related properties. It is shown that novel analytical methods are useful for improving analytical work in this entire field.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1438-1656	1527-2648		WOS:000775789300001

Using propane as a precursor, N-GNFs with low relative amounts of bonded oxygen, large specific surface area (200-500 m(2)/g) and nitrogen doping level of 1-3% are produced by adjusting the buffer gas of the reaction system. N-doping is confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and elemental CNHSO analysis. The effects of buffer gas on N-GNFs are investigated. It is found that the nitrogen configuration is always dominated by pyrrolic nitrogen. A high nitrogen flow rate with a total flow rate constant promotes a higher doping level of N, but more defects appear. The addition of NH3 or H-2 further increases the nitrogen doping level, and eliminates some defects. Different buffer gases lead to different types and concentrations of active species, which is a key factor in the synthesis of nitrogen-doped graphene.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0925-9635	1879-0062		WOS:000696984200001

It is therefore of interest as a possible biocatalyst for the synthesis of organosiloxanes. To further investigate the substrate scope of this enzyme, a series of condensation reactions with a variety of phenols and aliphatic alcohols were carried out. In general, it was observed that Sil alpha demonstrated a preference for phenols, though the conversions were relatively modest in most cases. In the two pairs of chiral alcohols that were investigated, it was found that the enzyme displayed a preference for the silylation of the S-enantiomers. Additionally, the enzyme's tolerance to a range of solvents was tested. Sil alpha had the highest level of substrate conversion in the nonpolar solvents n-octane and toluene, although the inclusion of up to 20% of 1,4-dioxane was tolerated. These results suggest that Sil alpha is a potential candidate for directed evolution toward future application as a robust and selective biocatalyst for organosiloxane chemistry.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000688782100001

This is largely due to the various arrangements of the corner and edge sharing MnO6 octahedra that form a variety of sublattices. Not only do the interstitial sites that are generated in this process allow the occupancy of alkali, alkali earth cations, and water to stabilize the MnO2 framework but also the process itself requires energy which is competitive against probable oxygen evolution reaction. Owning to its higher mobility and higher conductivity as compared to common alkali cations such as Li+ and Na+, K+ was selected as the intercalating cation to form K0.6MnO2 and it was used as positive electrode. When paired with K+-adsorbed holey carbon as the negative electrode, the 2.4 V asymmetric aqueous supercapacitor was able to deliver 52.8 Wh kg(-1) and power density of 58.4 kW kg(-1). A good cyclic life of ca. 95% capacitance retention was also demonstrated after cycling for 10000 cycles at 20 A g(-1)									32	1	0	0	1	0	32			2574-0962			WOS:000458706600056

In the present work, a (TiO2/RuO2)/PTFE gas diffusion electrode (GDE) was designed and characterized to be used in the electrochemical conversion of methane into methanol in conditions of simultaneous oxygen evolution. The GDE was obtained by pressing and sintering TiO2(0.7)/RuO2(0.3) powder and PTFE and used for the electrosynthesis of methanol from methane. In the experiments, methane was inserted into the reaction medium by the GDE and electrosynthesis was carried out in 0.1 mol L-1 Na2SO4 supporting electrolyte. Controlled potential experiments showed that methanol concentration increased with applied potential, reaching 220 mg L-1 cm(2), at 2.2 V vs. a calomel reference electrode and current efficiency for methanol formation was 30%. Mass spectrometry data also indicated the formation of formaldehyde and formic acid, the latter at a similar rate as that of methanol.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000208270700004

Laser-induced fluorescence in the B2Sigma+-X2Pii system of OH								AIP Conference Proceedings					191			645	7						1989	1989	Laser-induced fluorescence in the previously unobserved B-X system is used to detect the high vibrational levels of ground state OH generated by the reaction of H and O3. Light (220-240 nm) from a frequency-doubled tunable dye laser excites the (0,8), (0,9) and (1,8) vibrational bands of the B-X system. The B state then fluoresces predominantly to the A2Sigma+ state between 400 and 600 nm. Weaker fluorescence to the X state is also observed. From the temporal evolution of the fluorescence, lifetimes are extracted for different vibrational, rotational, and fine-structure levels of the B state. Large variations are observed between these levels indicating an unexpected predissociation.					Advances in Laser Science-IV. Fourth Laser Science ConferenceAdvances in Laser Science-IV.

However, its poor charge transfer ability results in unsatisfactory PEC performance. From the view of material design, a nail-like alpha- SnWO4 array film was constructed by a hydrothermal method assisted by halogen ions, and the corresponding physical and PEC properties are discussed. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also performed to help understand the effect of halogen ions (Cl-, F-) on the growth and exposure facet of alpha- SnWO4 and the underlying mechanism of PEC performance. The existence of F- decreases the surface energy of the {100} and {001} facets, directions along which the film has better charge transfer, and the {001} facet has a lower barrier in the PEC water oxidation reaction. The alpha-SnWO4 film photoanode after facet regulation presents better charge transfer ability, and the oxygen evolution rate is 0.16 mu mol cm-2 h-1. In addition, a 1.9-fold photoresponse current is obtained during unbiased PEC water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000874964900001

Herein, ten different gradient nanocarbons with well-defined edge topologies and sizes are used as models to investigate the explicit function of each common edge at a molecular level. We suggest that both armchair and zigzag configurations are positive in H2O2 formation. Direct proportional structure-function relationships between the size/number/areas of edges and the activities are then proposed. Moreover, the dynamic evolution processes and kinetic behaviors of key intermediate products including O-2 (ads) and superoxide anion O-2(-)* are monitored with time-resolved infrared spectroscopy and simulation calculations. Depending on different edge configurations, O-2 (ads) and O-2(-)* species show a steep growth trend in the first 7.3 and 10 s and reach equilibrium until 10 and 13.3 s, respectively. O-2 (ads) + e- -> O-2(-)* as a possible rate-determining step (RDS) is evidenced by isotopic-labeling studies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2590-2393	2590-2385		WOS:000810939100008

This method requires a catalytic mask that is generally composed of a metal. Here, we challenge the general view that the catalyst needs to be a metal by introducing oxide-assisted chemical etching (OACE). We perform etching with metal oxides such as RuO2 and IrO2 by transposing materials used in electrocatalysis to nanofabrication. These oxides can be solution-processed as polymers exhibiting similar capabilities of metals for MACE. Nanopatterned oxides can be obtained by direct nanoimprint lithography or block-copolymer lithography from chemical solution on a large scale. High aspect ratio silicon nanostructures were obtained at the sub-20 nm scale exclusively by cost-effective solution processing by halving the number of fabrication steps compared to MACE. In general, OACE is expected to stimulate new fundamental research on chemical etching assisted by other materials, providing new possibilities for device fabrication.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000629091100054	33600718

Bismuth vanadate with a 2.4-2.5 eV band gap has shown the most promise becauses its photoactivity down to 0.4 V vs RHE is sufficiently low to couple to a lower-gap photocathode for fuel synthesis. Through development of photoanodes based on the FeWO4 structure, in particular, Fe-rich variants with addition of about 6% Bi, we demonstrate the same 0.4 V vs RHE turn-on voltage with a 2 eV band gap metal oxide, enabling a 2-fold increase in the device efficiency limit. Combinatorial exploration of materials composition and processing facilitated synthesis of n-type variants of this typical p-type semiconductor that exhibit much higher photoactivity than previous implementations of FeWO4 in solar photochemistry. The photoanodes are particularly promising for solar fuel applications given their stable operation in acid and base.									12	1	0	0	1	0	13			2380-8195			WOS:000450374600020

In the present work, we employ density functional theory calculations to examine a variety of different active sites in N-doped graphene to give a comprehensive outline of the trends in activity. We find that adsorption energies of COOH* and CO* do not follow the linear scaling relationships observed for the pure transition metals, and this unique scaling is rationalized through differences in electronic structure between transition metals and defected graphene. This finding rationalizes most of the experimental observations on the carbon-based materials which present promising catalysts for the two-electron reduction of CO2 to CO. With this simple thermodynamic analysis, we identify several active sites that are expected to exhibit a comparable or even better activity to the state-of-the-art gold catalyst, and several configurations are suggested to be selective for CO2RR over HER.									77	4	0	0	5	0	77			2168-0485			WOS:000414825900168

The catalysts were characterized by XRD, XPS, FT-IR, and Raman and surface area measurement. A maximum yield of 76% of 2-CLBN was obtained at a temperature of 425 degrees C and a 2-CLT:NH3:air mole ratio of 1:8:22. DFT computations suggest that the reaction follows a Mars-van Krevelen (MVK) type of redox mechanism. The catalyst is first reduced by ammonia, producing an imine species. The 2-CLT molecule is also adsorbed through a vanadyl oxygen to produce a CH2=C6H5 species. This moiety is adsorbed over the catalyst through an imine formed on the surface to produce 2-chlorobenzonitrile. XPS spectra of fresh and spent catalysts confirm reduction of the catalyst during ammoxidation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The liquid structure of the solvent is included with the use of ab initio molecular dynamics to sample thousands of microstates with varying numbers of protons and electrons. The grand canonical probability weight function at constant pH and electrode potential is calculated a posteriori. The only inputs to the model are the fundamental assumptions of an equilibrated solvent, charge neutrality of the interface, and the dimensions of the system. The structures are unbiased outputs, and several atomic-scale quantities are calculated for our model system, water/Au(111), as weighted averages. We present the potentials of zero charge, Gibbs isotherms, and differential capacities as a function of pH. The potential of maximum entropy is also calculated, which to our knowledge has not previously been done with any first-principles method. The model predicts a non-Nernstian pH behavior for the potential of maximum entropy.									50	1	0	0	2	0	51			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000391160400027

Transmission electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, and X-ray diffraction are used to characterize the reaction path and nucleation mechanism yielding high critical current YBa2Cu3O7. Our results show that the pyrolysis of the trifluoracetate solutions yields a nanostructured, partially amorphous Ba1-xYxF2+x matrix having a Ba/Y ratio close to 2, with homogeneously dispersed CuO nanoparticles. Upon heating, the chemical trajectory of the fluoride matrix and the overall microstructural evolution of the ceramic precursor prior to YBa2Cu3O7 nucleation is driven by the decomposition and oxidation of this solid solution. The Y solid solubility decreases with temperature yielding Y2O3 which reacts with the CuO particles forming Y2Cu2O5 at about 700 degrees C. In addition, electron energy loss spectroscopy reveals a high oxygen concentration and almost no Y in the matrix quenched from 795 degrees C, at a stage where the YBa2Cu3Ox phase still forms disconnected 50-100 nm thick islands spaced by 1-2 mu m. The observed evolution from Ba1-xYxF2+x to a barium oxyfluoride mostly occurs prior to the heteroepitaxial nucleation of YBa2Cu3Ox at about 700 degrees C. Hence, a microstructural scenario is defined which favors competitive nucleation growth between heteroepitaxial YBa2Cu3Ox and bulk Y2Cu2O5. X-ray diffraction pole-figure analysis reveals that the oxyfluoride phase is heavily textured, exhibiting two epitaxial relationships with the (001)-LaAlO3 substrate: (001)OF//(001)LaAlO3, [110]OF//[100]LaAlO3 and (111)OF//(001)LaAlO3, [110]OF//[100]LaAlO3 (OF stands for oxyfluoride). High-resolution observations of the growth front support that (111)-oriented oxyfluoride regions provide low-barrier nucleation sites for c-axis-oriented YBa2Cu3Ox on the buried (001)-LaAlO3 substrate. However, owing to its high mismatch, this orientation only represents roughly 15% percent of the total OF volume. Considering that the nucleation of YBa2Cu3Ox is confined to those regions, this would lead to an anomalously large internuclei spacing, as is indeed observed, favoring the formation of large YBa2Cu3Ox grains and films with a low mosaic spread.									59	4	0	0	0	0	60			0897-4756			WOS:000242935500024

In this work we combine IrOx nanofibers with a conventional nanoparticle-based IrOx anode catalyst layer. With this hybrid design we can reduce the iridium loading by more than 80% while maintaining performance. In spite of an ultralow overall catalyst loading of 0.2 mg(Ir)/cm(2), a cell with a hybrid layer shows similar performance compared to a state-of-the-art cell with a catalyst loading of 1.2 mg(Ir)/cm(2) and clearly outperforms identically loaded reference cells with pure IrOx nanoparticle and pure nanofiber anodes. The improved performance is attributed to a combination of good electric contact and high porosity of the IrOx nanofibers with high surface area of the IrOx nanoparticles. Besides the improved performance, the hybrid layer also shows better stability in a potential cycling and a 150 h constant current test compared to an identically loaded nanoparticle reference.									38	0	0	0	1	0	38			2574-0962			WOS:000576676900021

The effect of parameters such as titanic acid phase, surface area and photocatalyst load on the deactivation of the photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B were studied. Photoatalysts were characterized by S-BET, XRD, UV-vis, XPS, HR-TEM, and H-2-TPR. We found that Pt-WO3/NT photocatalyst reached 90% of dye degradation in 60 min. WO3/NT reached 60% after 90 min under 450-nm visible light irradiation and pH neutral. The incorporation Pt nanoparticles into WO3/NT and V2O5/NT supports increased remarkably the photocatalytic activity during degradation of Rhodamine B. After reaction, an evolution from VO2 to V2O5 was observed. We also found the transition from W5+ to W6+. The transition from Pt-0 to Pt2+ was also observed. We concluded that the presence of Pt hinders the oxidation of the oxygen species on the surface of the titanate nanotubes.									4	1	0	0	0	0	5			2365-6549			WOS:000456717300036

The silicate constituent of mesosiderites has a chemical and oxygen isotopic composition analogous to those of meteorites of the HED group: howardites, eucrites, and diogenites. The hypothesis currently most widely accepted for the genesis of mesosiderites is the impact mixing of the material of a differentiated asteroid and an iron meteorite. In contrast to many other classes of meteorites, mesosiderites exhibit no traces of metasomatic processes. The Budulan mesosiderite is the first meteorite of this type in which traces of metasomatism under the effect of an anhydrous fluid were detected. The metasomatic alterations are manifested as chemical zoning of olivine, aggregates of secondary minerals, and the mobilization and redeposition of iron and nickel in the form of metals and sulfides. These alterations were most probably caused by a reaction of olivine with S- and/or CO-bearing gases of endogenic or supergenic provenance. Traces of such metasomatic alterations were previously found in some meteorites and lunar rocks, and these processes could likely play a certain role in the differentiation of chondritic bodies.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			0869-5911			WOS:000282210900001

Electrochemical characterization of the two electrodes were investigated by phenol electrochemical degradation, accelerated service life test, cyclic voltammetry (CV) in phenol solution, polarization curves in H2SO4. The surface morphology and crystal structure of two electrodes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The results showed a considerable difference between the two electrodes in their electrocatalytic activity, electrochemical stability and surface properties. Phenol was readily mineralized to CO2 at BDD electrode, favoring electrochemical combustion, but its degradation was much slower at SnO2 electrode. The service life of BDD electrode was 10 times longer than that of SnO2. Higher electrocatalytic activity and electrochemical stability of BDD electrode arise from its high oxygen evolution potential and the physically absorbed hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) on electrode surface.

J	Peng, Xi; Chen, Liyu; Li, Yingwei								Ordered macroporous MOF-based materials for catalysis								MOLECULAR CATALYSIS				529						112568	10.1016/j.mcat.2022.112568				AUG 2022	2022	Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) possess various excellent properties. However, most MOFs exhibit micro -porosity, which restricts their applications in diffusion-related processes. Recently, single-crystal ordered mac-roporous MOFs (SOM-MOFs) have been successfully fabricated via monolith templates combined with heterogeneous nucleation approaches. SOM-MOFs exhibit improved mass transfer efficiency and catalytic ac-tivity compared with their microporous counterparts. SOM-MOFs can be integrated with other functional ma-terials, including metal nanoparticles, polyoxometalates, and biomacromolecules, to enhance the characteristics of SOM-MOFs. Moreover, SOM-MOFs can act as ideal precursors and/or templates for the fabrication of ordered macroporous functional materials with well exposed active sites, good stability, and high conductivity. This review intends to offer an overview of recent advances in the synthesis of SOM-MOF-based nanomaterials and their applications in thermo-, photo-, and electrocatalysis, with particular emphasis on the discussion of the synthesis, properties, and structure-activity relationships. Furthermore, we propose the current challenges and future prospects of SOM-MOF-based materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2468-8231			WOS:000860540500002

The effects of operational parameters on AMX degradation efficiency were investigated, such as Fe2+ concentration, pH, applied current (mA) and initial AMX concentration. Kinetic analysis exhibited the degradation process followed the First-order kinetic model. Box-Behnken design (BBD) was applied here to determine and analyze the optimum operating condition. Up to17.68 mg.L-1 of H2O2 could be in situ generated in 120 min without external O-2 supply and reusability of the electrodes were analyzed. Moreover, a degradation mechanism with hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) as dominant oxidant was proposed. UPLC-MS analysis was performed to identify oxidation intermediates and thus a reasonable degradation pathway of AMX was speculated. Acute toxicity assessment showed a 50% decrease in biotoxicity of the treated effluent. The EF system provided a new insight into the effective pretreatment of antibiotic wastewater.

The effects of W doping on the densification, microstructure, and high temperature strength of ZrB2 ceramics were investigated. The reaction between ZrB2 and W resulted in the formation of WB, ZrB and boron vacancies in ZrB2-x. The solid solution formed by dissolving WB in ZrB2-x has core-shell structure, inhibited the grain growth and densification of ZrB2 ceramics. (W,Zr)B converted to liquid promoted densification at 2100 degrees C, and dissolved the oxygen from the surface of ZrB2 powders. The ZrB2 ceramics with 3-10 vol% W exhibited fine microstructures and high grain boundary strength.

J	Jasim, Ahmed M.; Hoff, Samuel E.; Xing, Yangchuan								Enhancing methanol electrooxidation activity using double oxide catalyst support of tin oxide clusters on doped titanium dioxides								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				261				221	226		10.1016/j.electacta.2017.12.149				JAN 20 2018	2018	Electrooxidation of methanol was investigated on platinum catalyst supported on a double oxide nanocomposite of tin oxide clusters and carbon-doped titanium dioxide nanocoatings on carbon nanotubes. Formation kinetics of the oxygenated species (-OH) groups was dramatically enhanced in the catalyst with double oxide support. This leads to a much lower onset potential for adsorbed CO oxidation with a much enhanced bifunctional effect in tin oxide. The electrocatalyst demonstrated a higher forward peak current density in methanol electrooxidation than the electrocatalyst with single tin oxide or bare carbon as support. Binding energy shift in oxidation states was observed for the double oxide support catalyst and is attributed to strong metal support interactions. Doping with carbon in the titanium oxide enables backward electron donation, making the supported platinum more electron negative and stable. This study demonstrated a synergistic effect of combining bifunctional and electronic mechanisms with double oxide support in the enhancement of methanol electrooxidation. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, we report our recent finding that surface introduction of an amorphous nickel borate (Ni-Bi) layer on a nickel oxide (NiO) nanosheet array on carbon cloth (NiO/CC) can greatly enhance its electrochemical water oxidation activity under alkaline conditions. In a 1.0 M KOH solution, the resulting core shell NiO@Ni-Bi/CC shows superior electrochemical catalytic activity of only 290 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2), 100 mV less than that for NiO/CC. Meanwhile, this catalyst electrode shows great long-term durability for at least 25 h. The high activity can be ascribed to the Ni-Bi layer on Nio promoting NiOOH generation as the active species. This study provides us an abundant water oxidation catalyst in an alkaline water electrolysis device for high-performance, durable electrolytic hydrogen production.									46	2	0	0	4	0	46			2168-0485			WOS:000412382700004

Here, a nitrogen-doped porous carbon material is proposed to electrocatalytically reduce CO (2) to CO with high activity, selectivity and superior durability. The material is synthesized by a facile one-step pyrolysis approach using biomass, namely wheat flour, and KOH as starting materials. The resulting materials show high surface area with hierarchical porous structures, and the nitrogen content and functional species can be controlled to some extent via the pyrolysis temperature. The catalyst exhibits a maximum faradaic efficiency of 83.7% and a partial current density of CO of 6.6 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 0.71 V in aqueous bicarbonate medium. Moreover, it also demonstrates superior long-term durability with trivial loss of activity and selectivity. Mechanistic study indicates that the pyridinic nitrogen is responsible for the high catalytic activity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The electrode has good hydrophobic surface (the hydrophobic angle can reach 123 degrees), high over point oxygen evolution (OEP) (1.60 V vs SCE), and good service life (81 h).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy confirmed that the ultra-long nanowires are composed of ZnS and ZnIn2S4. Scanning electron microscopy showed the morphology of ultra-thin nanosheets with an average thickness of 8.5 nm cross from inside to outside, forming ZnS/ZnIn2S4 microspheres with a porous diameter of about 2.8 mu m. Nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm determined that the BET specific surface area of the microspheres was 109.19 m(2)/g which showed that they have a large specific surface area. The obtained ZnS/ZnIn2S4 microspheres showed broad absorbance ranging from UV (200 nm) to visible (520 nm) with low indirect band gaps of 2.08 eV. It leads to outstanding visible-light-driven photocatalysis for the degradation of xylenol orange (XO) and thymol blue (TB) in water, and the two dyes were almost completely degraded after 60 and 135 min, respectively. This provides new potential to explore nanomaterials for efficient photo-driven degradation of organic dyes under visible light irradiation.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1				1750-0443		WOS:000687695500003

Characterization and optimization of electrode was performed with scanning electron microscope (SEM),X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and electrochemical workstation. The electrocatalytic degradation of amoxicillin (AMX) was carried out with the optimized electrode,and the degradation of AMX and variation of its toxicity were also investigated. Results show that ACF was present on the surface layer of the electrode in a " filled in" manner,after modification. The performance of selected electrode was improved in terms of oxygen-evolution overpotential,charge transfer rate,·OH production capacity and stability. AMX degradation results showed that after 120 minutes of electrocatalytic treatment,the removal and mineralization of targeted pollutant reached 70.7% and 58.6%,respectively.

In this study, we report a one-pot hydrothermal synthesis of polyvinyl-pyrrolidone (PVP)-decorated nickel-iron diselenide hollow nanoparticles with strongly hydrophilic surface, the hollow architecture of which could be assigned to the Kirkendall effect. As the lactam groups in PVP are strongly polar and incline to interact with water molecules, the surface wettability of the electrocatalyst was effectively improved after PVP was introduced. Compared with the pristine one, such PVP decorated nickel-iron diselenide hollow nanoparticles demands only a low overpotential of 255 mV to drive a geometrical current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. Moreover, this PVP involved electrocatalyst yields a low Tafel slope of 56 mV dec(-1) and possesses remarkably long-term durability. This surface engineering insight provides an indication for fabrication of high-efficient OER electrocatalysts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the BiVO4 nanorod array was successfully synthesized on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses via a simple solution method, and the electrode was applied as the photoanode for water oxidation. The highest photocurrent density of 0.12 mA cm(-2) (measured at 1.23 V vs. RHE) and the smallest onset potential of 0.32 V vs. RHE were obtained for the optimized BiVO4 electrode under AM 1.5G illumination due to the rough surface for promoting light absorption and the one-dimensional (1D) pathway for accelerating the charge transfer, which benefitted from the rod-like structure. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was applied to analyze the charge-transfer resistance and electron lifetime of the system. The results suggest that the well-defined nanorod structure can be realized by simply tuning the reaction parameters, and this 1D nanostructure can simultaneously achieve high light absorption and a long electron lifetime, which favor the high photocatalytic ability for water oxidation.									49	1	0	0	3	0	49			2046-2069			WOS:000393757100014

The air cathode has been certified as one of the critical aspects to affect the full performance of the LABs. At present, the main challenge for the commercial application of air cathode is to exploit some new cathode catalysts with lower prices, higher efficiency, and better stability. In the last decade, tremendous efforts have been dedicated to developing new structure design and fabrication processes of the cathode materials to promote the full capability of the LABs. The recent research progress of bifunctional cathode catalysts for LABs, including the main improvement strategies and performance of cathode materials, is introduced in this paper.

The main goal of this study was to verify the efficiency of added CaSi to processed heats in two batches, i.e., first for deep desulfurization at the beginning of the secondary metallurgy and then in a second smaller batch at the end of that process for final modification. At the beginning of the secondary metallurgy process, it was crucial to prepare a suitable chemical composition of ladle slag with advantageous properties for good assimilation of sulfur-based inclusions from desulfurization reactions. Samples were taken of final basic oxygen furnace slag, ladle slag before the deep desulfurization process at the beginning of secondary metallurgy and ladle slag at the end of processing. Detailed cleanliness analyses of steel samples taken from mold during the casting were performed using the Automated Steel Cleanliness Analyses Tool. For better understanding and interpretation of the obtained cleanliness results and their relationship, the following defined parameters were used: ratio of "Ca/Al" oxide inclusions, percentage of "liquid" inclusions and area of CaS inclusions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0972-2815	0975-1645		WOS:000815430300001

The photoelectrocatalysts were designed by electrostatic association of the amino acids and [PMo12O40]3- for achieving (amino acid)3PMA followed by covalent attachment to Co3O4-QDs. The prepared Co/(ABA)3PMA and Co/(gly)3PMA nanocomposites were immobilized on charcoal using an alternate electrophoretic approach. Interestingly, the formation of nanocomposite structures remarkably enhanced the photo-generated charge separation and photoelectrocatalytic performance. Comparison of the results of photoelectrocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol with that of photocatalytic and catalytic ones revealed that no reaction occurred during the catalytic tests, while the photocatalytic performance was positively affected by the utilization of a small bias (0.9 V vs. saturated calomel electrode). The Co3O4-QDs increases the visible light absorption and H3PMo12O40 with appropriate energy levels increases the charge mobility in nanocomposites structures. A plausible mechanism for the photoelectrocatalytic oxidation was suggested and illustrated using the results of scavenger tests and energy level determination.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0022-3697	1879-2553		WOS:000737303700004

Herein, 3D worm-like bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) is grafted on 2D thin tungsten trioxide (WO3) underlayer by electrodeposition to form mixededimensional structured photoanode, resulting in significant improvement of the photocatalytic performance and the charge separation efficiency. Characterization results prove that the mixededimensional structured can boost the photocatalytic activity by suppressing back reaction and charge recombination of the bulk BiVO4. Simultaneously, the electrical conductivity of photoanode can be increased by W6+ doping. Furthermore, a robust catalyst NiCo2Ox is coated onto the surface of WO3/BiVO4 photoanode, exhibiting a desirable photocurrent of 3.85 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE and an excellent stability over 3 h. Both the excellent photocurrent density and great operational stability of this 2D/3D WO3/BiVO4 photoanode make it a promising material for practical applications.

In view of this, fabricating hybrid nanomaterials by integrating noble metal nanocrystals and other species turns out to be a powerful way to produce unprecedented catalysts which could combine the merits of different components and modulate the electronic states of Pt or Pd at the same time. In this review, we list recent studies in the construction of heterostructured hybrid nanocatalysts through introducing external components into the noble metal nanocrystals. The mentioned external components include heteroatom doped carbon nanomaterials, metal oxides and hydroxides, as well as transition metal carbides, nitrides, phosphides, and sulfides. The construction methodologies and functions that these introduced species played in the catalytic processes of methanol electrooxidation are discussed. The attempts to maximize the catalytically active interfaces and utilization efficiencies of noble metals are also presented. Finally, the conclusions and existing problems in relevant nanocatalysts are provided.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000488835000001	31538637

Surface coatings were successfully applied to the PAN precursor and the coated fibers were pre-oxidized over the microwave furnace for 60 min. To study the effect of the coatings on the pre-oxidized fibers, a series of characterizations were carried out. FTIR analysis results showed clear changes in the basic chemical structure of pre-oxidized fibers, which approved the occurrence of the cyclization and crosslinking reactions. Furthermore, the cyclization was confirmed by the thermal analysis results. According to the listed oxygen values, it can be suggested that the pre-oxidized fibers can resist the high temperatures in the following stage (carbonization). In addition, the crystalline analysis revealed a reduction in crystallinity, while the mechanical analysis demonstrated a reduction in tensile strength and elongation at break of pre-oxidized fibers.

They were modified with catalytic multilayers (CMs) for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER), respectively, using simple and versatile layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly. The deposition of the respective CMs composed of cationic polyelectrolyte and anionic molecular polyoxometalate (POM) electrocatalysts resulted in remarkably improved performance in terms of both photocatalytic activity and stability. Detailed PEC analysis revealed that the CMs not only facilitated (1) charge transport to and (2) catalytic charge transfer at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface, but also suppressed the deactivation of photoelectrodes, especially a labile Cu2O photocathode, by the formation of a protective coating layer. As a result, we could successfully fabricate an efficient and stable PEC cell for unassisted solar water splitting without the use of toxic/hazardous chemicals and energetic processes, which have been inevitably employed. We believe that this study provides a simple and versatile platform for the design and fabrication of various forms of electrochemical PEC devices in an environmentally friendly manner.									40	0	0	0	0	0	40			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000442265000011

The system degree of preferential [001] orientation, as well as nanopyramid size, geometrical shape, and density distribution, can be finely tuned by varying the growth temperature between 300 and 400 degrees C, whereas higher temperatures lead to more compact systems with a three-dimensional (3D) morphology. A growth mechanism of the obtained ZnO nanostructures based on a self-catalytic vapor-solid (VS) mode is proposed, in order to explain the evolution of nanostructure morphologies as a function of the adopted process conditions. The results obtained by a thorough chemico-physical characterization enable us to get an improved control over the properties of ZnO nanopyramids grown by this technique. Taken together, they are of noticeable importance not only for fundamental research on ZnO nanomaterials with controlled nano-organization but also to tailor ZnO functionalities in view of various potential applications.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1528-7483	1528-7505		WOS:000429508200073

An electrochemical flow reactor with a boron-doped diamond film anode was used and constant current experiments were conducted in batch recirculation mode. The mass transfer characteristics of the electrochemical device were determined by voltammetric experiments in the potential region of water stability, followed by a controlled current experiment in the potential region of oxygen evolution. The average mass transfer coefficient was 5.2 x 10(-5) m s(-1). The pond water was then processed to remove HA and algae in the conditions in which the reaction combustion occurred under mass transfer control. To this end, the mass transfer coefficient was used to estimate the initial limiting current density applied in the electrolytic experiments. As expected, all the parameters analyzed here-solution absorbance at 270 nm, total phenol concentration and total organic carbon concentration-decayed according to first-order kinetics. Since the diamond film anode successfully incinerated organic matter, the electrochemical system proved to be predictable and programmable.									21	0	0	0	14	1	21			0021-891X			WOS:000254804700018

The catalytic activity was found to be inversely proportional to the baking temperature, which varied from 50 to 500 degrees C. We found the formation of a hybrid nanocomposite thin film of NiOx nanocrystals (<2 nm size) inside an acetate-based organic matrix at low temperatures (<200 degrees C). The defective and short-range structural order of the NiOx-based nanocomposite electrocatalysts, compatible with lattice stress, low electrical conductivity, and high density of catalytically active surface species, and higher Fe incorporation were responsible for the enhanced electrocatalytic activity. Our champion NiOx catalyst features a 358 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) and more than 60 h of continuous operation without significant losses, which is a remarkable milestone for undoped NiOx electrocatalysts synthesized at nearly room temperature by a solution-processed up-scalable method.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2574-0962			WOS:000656119600102

Electrochemical characterization of both composites points out that the electrodes with polyaniline show a higher capacitance than the pristine porous carbon electrode. These materials have been used to develop an asymmetric capacitor based on activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode and an ACF-PANI composite as positive electrode in H2SO4 solution as electrolyte. The presence of a thin layer of polyaniline inside the porosity of the activated carbon fibres avoids the oxidation of the carbon material and the oxygen evolution reaction is produced at more positive potentials. This capacitor was tested in a maximum cell voltage of 1.6V and exhibited high energy densities, calculated for the unpackaged active materials, with values of 20Wh kg(-1) and power densities of 2.1 kW kg(-1) with excellent cycle lifetime (90% during the first 1000 cycles) and high coulombic efficiency.

All the different materials tested gave yields of chlorine of > 90% and first-order kinetics for the reduction of the Ce(IV) ions. The samples prepared by the Adams method were the most active of the materials tested and are typified by high surface areas and appreciable activities per unit area. The kinetics of the catalysed reduction of Ce(IV) ions by brine were studied in detail using an Ru(IV) oxide prepared by the Adams method and supported on TiO2 and the results were rationalised in terms of an electrochemical model in which the rate-determining step is the diffusion-controlled reduction of Ce(IV) ions. In support of this model the measured activation energies for the oxidation of brine by Ce(IV) ions, catalysed by either a supported or unsupported Adams catalyst, were both close (18-21 kJ mol-1) to that expected for a diffusion-controlled reaction (ca. 15 kJ mol-1).									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0956-5000			WOS:A1991GK45600029

In this study, Zn2SnxTi1-xO4 (0 <= x <= 1) solid-solution photocatalysts with an inverse spinel structure were prepared using the molten-salt-assisted method. The Zn2SnxTi1-xO4 solid-solution photocatalyst effectively enhanced CO2 photoreduction due to the increase in optical excitation centers, including SnO4 tetrahedrons, ZnO6, and TiO6 octahedrons. Numerous photoexcited centers generated sufficient photogenerated carriers to increase the overall redox reaction rate of H2O and CO2. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis revealed that the distortion of the structural unit of the Zn2SnxTi1-xO4 solid solution not only improved the separation of photogenerated charges but also promoted the activation of CO2 molecules on the catalyst surface. Moreover, the reduction in the effective mass of photogenerated carriers in the Zn2SnxTi1-xO4 solid solution enables their fast migration, which results in excellent carrier movement.

Due to the scarce investigation of thick electrodes at the practical full-cell level, the understanding of thermal failure mechanism is still insufficient. Herein, an intrinsic origin of thermal instability in fully charged industrial pouch cells during high-temperature storage is discovered. Through the investigation from crystals to particles, and from electrodes to cells, it is shown that serious top-down heterogeneous degradation occurs along the depth direction of the thick electrode, including phase transition, cationic disordering, intergranular/intragranular cracks, and side reactions. Such degradation originates from the abundant oxygen vacancies and reduced catalytic Ni2+ at cathode surface, causing microstructural defects and directly leading to the thermal instability. Nonmagnetic elements doping and surface modification are suggested to be effective in mitigating the thermal instability through modulating cationic disordering.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000674506600001	34288385

Taking the alpha-Fe2O3 semiconductor (SC) decorated with the cobalt oxide ECs as the model photoanode system, we demonstrate the opposite changes of PEC water oxidation activities by tuning the charge-storage capacity of ECs. Holes stored in the EC can increase the hole density on the photoanode surface, which can benefit the multihole surface water oxidation reaction, as well as aggravate the SC EC interfacial charge recombination due to the Coulomb attraction. Both experimental and theoretical data prove that the EC with low hole-storage capacity brings limited interfacial charge recombination, enabling faster hole injection to improve the water oxidation activity. In contrast, the EC with high hole-storage capacity causes severe interfacial charge recombination, hindering the hole injection, thus decreasing the water oxidation activity. As a result, the PEC activity of photoanodes changes nonmonotonically with increasing surface hole density. This study can provide insightful guidance to interface design for solar energy-conversion systems.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000500417600026

Among many potential photocatalysts, hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) emerges as a highly promising photoanode material with favorable characteristics including visible light absorption (a suitable band gap energy), earth abundance, chemical stability, and low cost. A pronounced disadvantage of alpha-Fe2O3 is its low photovoltage together with an extremely short hole diffusion length and a low electrical conductivity, which limit its PEC water oxidation performance. To make alpha-Fe2O3 as a viable photocatalyst for PEC water splitting, one needs to rectify these unfavorable characteristics of alpha-Fe2O3 by elaborated multiple modifications. In this review article, we introduce various modification strategies of hematite with emphasis on surface modifications to achieve low onset potential as well as high photocurrent approaching the theoretical value for solar water splitting.									75	4	0	0	6	0	75			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000457144200010

Although much progress has been made in the past decade in understanding the reaction chemistry of this battery system, many issues must be resolved regarding the active components, including the air electrode and electrolyte, to overcome the presently insufficient cycle life. In this work, we demonstrate that the degradation kinetics of both the air electrode and electrolyte during cycles can be significantly retarded through control of the crystallinity of the carbon electrode, the most frequently used air electrode in current Li-O-2 batteries. Using C-13-based air electrodes with various degrees of graphitic crystallinity and in situ differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy analysis, it is demonstrated that, as the crystallinity increases in the carbon, the CO2 evolution from the cell is significantly reduced, which leads to a 3-fold enhancement in the cyclic stability of the cell.									36	2	0	0	2	0	38			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000388914500009

In this study, a pilot-scale ceramic filter was used to remove the organic aerosols from furnace flue gas produced from industrial processes. The performance of ceramic filter and long-term stability of ceramic material were investigated. It showed that gas permeation flux fluctuated at a high level, which was the result of the surface filtration and special self-regeneration of the vertical ceramic filter. Removal efficiencies of TSP, PM10, and PM 2.5 aerosols were higher than 98.5%, and the rejection mechanisms were concluded as sieving, surface adhesion, and pore channel capture. Chemical characteristics of aerosol were analyzed based on FTIR spectra. Main organic compounds in the collected aerosols were paraffin binder, carboxylic acids, and esters. Carboxylic acids and esters were the products of the chemical reactions of paraffin and oxygen at high temperatures. After a long-term operation, ceramic membranes exhibited low flexural strength loss and slight variation in pore size distribution and the microstructure remained unchanged. Therefore, porous alumina membranes have potential for applications in the of removal organic aerosol emissions from industrial processes before reaching the atmosphere.									12	1	0	0	1	0	13			0888-5885			WOS:000317873200022

The photosynthetical activities of freshly isolated chloroplasts from spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) and peas (Pisum sativum L.) have been compared under well-defined conditions. The standard for the rate of photosynthesis was the oxygen evolution, which has been detected by a Clark-type electrode. The ratio between the oxygen production rate before and after a sample addition describes the chloroplast activity. In the presence of herbicides this ratio decreases. Increasing herbicide concentrations have been determined by a normalization procedure in semilogarithmic scales using a sigmoidal calibration plot.Photosynthesis inhibiting substances, both natural and anthropogenic, can be detected collectively. That is an advantage over enzyme immunoassays which can only detect single herbicides. Clearly disadvantageous are the insufficient detection limits (e.g. 8.9 mug/l for atrazine, respectively 2.5 mug/l for terbuthylazine) and therefore the necessary preconcentration.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0026-3672			WOS:A1993KU57100003

However, the most widely used approach to fabricate an air electrode involves polymeric binders, which may increase the interface resistance and block electrocatalytic active sites, thus deteriorating the performance of the battery. Therefore, binder-free air electrodes have attracted more and more research interests in recent years. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in designing and fabricating binder-free air electrodes for electrically rechargeable Zn-air batteries. Beginning with the fundamentals of Zn-air batteries and recently reported bifunctional active catalysts, self-supported air electrodes for liquid-state and flexible solid-state Zn-air batteries are then discussed in detail.

Recent experimental studies showed that olivine phosphates with mixed alkali metals (Li and Na) and mixed transition metals (Ni and Fe) provide better electrocatalytic activity compared to single alkali and transition metal alternatives. In the current work, we analyzed the role of alkali metals, transition metals and vacancies on the reactivity of a series of olivine phosphates with different stoichiometries using first principles calculations. To this end, we investigated the adsorption of water at the surface of these materials. We found that water binds preferably at Ni surface sites for materials devoid of alkali ion vacancies. We further found correlation between the calculated adsorption energy with experimentally measured overpotentials for a series of olivine phosphates. Additionally, we found correlation between the adsorption energy of the systems with the total charge polarization of surface and adsorbate. To explain the computed trends, we analyzed the occupancies of the partial density of states of the Ni and Fe 3d states and Bader atomic charges.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000560694000017	35521130

The developed reaction was based on a nascent hydrogen reduction, a strong agent that allows the simultaneous reduction of components, leading to a material with synergic features. The rGO/WO3 nanocomposite was extensively characterized by various techniques confirming the obtainment through the proposed route. The supercapacitive properties of rGO/WO3 electrode were evaluated and the results showed a specific capacitance of 287 F g(-1) at 0.3 A g(-1), with more than 70% of stability even after 3000 cycles, 2.4 times higher than WO3 itself. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports of such simple and fast synthesis of rGO/WO3-based materials, along with promising performance as electrode for supercapacitors. Besides, the development of this work had no dependence on hydrazine and sodium borohydride, highly hazardous chemicals commonly employed for rGO-based nanocomposites, or any expensive equipment.									7	0	1	0	1	0	8			2190-5509	2190-5517		WOS:000513244100016

Tidal detonation is also a WD explosion induced by a TDE. In this case, helium (He) and carbon-oxygen (CO) detonation waves incinerate He WDs and CO WDs, respectively. On the other hand, for tidal double detonation, He detonation is first excited in the He shell of a CO WD, which then drives CO detonation in the CO core. We name this mechanism after the double detonation scenario in the context of type Ia supernovae. In this paper, by performing numerical simulations for CO WDs of mass 0.60M(circle dot) with and without a He shell, we show that tidal double detonation occurs in the shallower encounter of a CO WD with an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) compared to simple tidal detonation. We expect tidal double detonation will increase the possibility of the occurrence of WD TDEs, which can help us to understand IMBHs.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000438222600015

Meeting this challenge of providing abundant, clean energy undoubtedly requires synergistic efforts between basic and applied researchers in the chemical sciences to develop and deploy new technologies. Among the available options, solar energy is one of the promising targets because of the high abundance of solar photons over much of the globe. Similarly, decarbonization of the global energy supply will require clean sources of hydrogen to use as reducing equivalents for fuel and chemical feedstocks. In this report, we discuss the importance of translational research-defined as work that explicitly targets basic discovery as well as technology development-in the context of photovoltaics and solar fuels. We focus on three representative research programs encompassing translational research in government, industry, and academia.

Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images show that the as-prepared hollow microspheres possess an average diameter of similar to 450 nm and a compact, thin, polycrystalline shell with an average thickness of similar to 50 nm. When used as an anode material for lithium ion batteries, CuxCo3-xO4 hollow microspheres exhibit a high lithium storage capacity, which is strongly dependent on the annealing temperature of the CuxCo3-xO4 intermediate. As a result, CuxCo3-xO4 hollow microspheres annealed at 400 degrees C deliver a reversible discharge specific capacity as high as 1187 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1) after 50 cycles. Such superior lithium storage performance is derived from the particular microstructure of the shell, which is composed of highly close-connected fine nanoparticles, as well as the resultant better electronic conductivity.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2046-2069			WOS:000379678200074

Measures involved a variety of coal and char types, as well as different experimental techniques, ranging from TGA to wire mesh reactors and drop tube furnaces. For oxy-combustion with flue gas recirculation the impact of CO2 on the rate of combustion of char combustion is still controversial.In the present paper the rate of carbon conversion in O-2/CO2 mixtures typical of oxyfuel conditions has been investigated by conventional as well as innovative experimental techniques, respectively isothermal/non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis and reaction in an aerodynamic levitator particle reactor (ALPR).Results show that the ALPR provides reliable results also at values of temperature and oxygen concentration where thermogravimetric analysis fails. Experimental results have been worked out to obtain simple rate expressions for oxy-fuel combustion. Commonly used kinetic laws, however, proved unable to fit the experimental results in the whole range of operating conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

EC generation of hydroxyl radicals via the oxidation of water was determined to precede that of ozone. OH. current yields were affected virtually solely by the current density, with almost negligible effects of variations of pH and carbonate concentrations. Absolute values of the current yields of EC generated OH. radicals were close to 1.0% for current densities > 30 mA/cm(2). The EC generation of ozone was suppressed in the presence of organic species, primarily due to the interception of OH. radicals that react with oxygen to firm ozone. Apparent kinetic constants of major reactions associated with the EC generation of ozone were determined based on a steady-state model of tin EC-controlled continuous flow reactor.									14	1	0	0	6	0	15			0191-9512	1547-6545		WOS:000255167600001

To solve these two problems, crystallographic facet orientation and cocatalyst emergence with a high-quality photoanode/cocatalyst interface were realized through an air annealing-assisted strategy to treat atomic layer deposition (ALD)-modified SnS2 nanosheet arrays. Based on experimental observations and theoretical calculations, the reduced (001) crystal facet of SnS2 decreases the recombination of photogenerated carriers in the bulk and improves the carrier separation of the photoanode. Moreover, the unexpectedly formed ZnTiOxSy film decreases the overpotential of the surface OER, reduces interface recombination, and extends the carrier lifetime. These synergistic effects lead to significantly enhanced PEC performance, with a high photocurrent density of 1.97 mA cm-2 at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a low onset potential of 0.21 V vs. RHE, which are superior to reported mostly SnS2-based photoanodes.(c) 2022 Science China Press.

Amongst, the spinel-type oxides, materials such as cobaltites (Co3O4) received significant attention, owing to their use in many industrial applications. In the present study, nanosized Cu, Ni, and Zn cobaltite spinel oxides were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method. Physicochemical characterization of the synthesized materials was performed utilizing XRD, HRTEM, CO2-TPD, and XPS techniques. The textural characteristics (BET-surface area, pore size, etc.) of samples were determined from N-2 physisorption measurements at -196 degrees C. The CO2-electrocatalytic reduction was selected as a model reaction to evaluate the electrochemical performance of the synthesized spinel cobaltites. For Ni, Cu, and Zn spinel materials, hydrogen was produced as the main product at the whole potential, along with other products, such as CO and HCOOH. Despite the advantages, the catalytic electrochemical CO2 reduction performance of spinel cobaltite catalysts is still far from adequate, which is principally ascribed to the low number of active sites combined with poor electrical conductivity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000846166500001

Strain engineering is a universal scheme that can finely tailor the bandgap and electronic structure of materials, hence supplying a novel avenue to boost their photocatalytic performance. Accordingly, to explore promising directions for certain breakthroughs in strained photocatalysts, an overview on the recent advances of strain engineering from the basics of strain effect, creations of strained materials, as well as characterizations and simulations of strain level is provided. Besides, the potential applications of strain engineering in photocatalysis are summarized, and a vision for the future controllable-electronic-structure photocatalysts by strain engineering is also given. Finally, perspectives on the challenges for future strain-promoted photocatalysis are discussed, placing emphasis on the creation and decoupling of strain effect, and the modification of theoretical frameworks.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000807101400001	35304927

We theoretically and experimentally investigated the influences of nonmetallic elements of B as electron acceptor, and S and P as electron donor on tuning NRR activity. We revealed that the heteroatomdoping of S atoms induced changing of center position of the pz orbital of B facilitates the adsorption of N2 on S-CB sites and reduces the energy barriers for rate-determining steps. The S6.23-B8.09/CNFs exhibits the highest NRR activity with high Faradaic efficiency of 22.4 % and NH3 yield of 0.223 mu mol h-1 cm-2 at -0.7 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. The combined computational and experimental works uncover the relationship between the p-band center of heteroatom doped carbon catalysts and NRR activity.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000663216900001

The result indicated that intensity of XRD diffraction peaks for MoS2 increase slightly as with the increase of RGO content. Mesopores of the MoS2, Ni-MoS2/RGO-10 and Ni-MoS2/RGO-15 are mainly distributed in the pore diameter rage of 2-50 nm. The addition of RGO increase the layer numbers of MoS2 in Ni-MoS2/RGO. Two Raman characteristic peaks at about 378 and 400 cm(-1) according to A(1g) and E-2g(1) modes have been observed in the MoS2 and Ni-MoS2/RGO. The eletrocatalytic test results show that the Ni-MoS2/RGO-5 has the lowest overpotentials of 349 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and the Ni-MoS2/RGO-10 has the lowest overpotentials of 398 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER. Moderate Ni doping and RGO composites can effectively improve the intrinsic conductivity, the hydrogen adsorption free energy for HER, as well as providing more active sites for HER and OER.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1452-3981			WOS:000629654700023

In this work, a biodiesel industrial waste by-product, glycerol, played the critical role for the efficient hydrogen production as well as the highly valuable dihydroxyacetone (DHA) and industrial useful formic acid production. As the glycerol was introduced, a remarkable cathodic shift of the onset potential was observed (similar to 300 mV) while the current density was 4 times higher compared to the water oxidation. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of BiVO4 photoanode for glycerol oxidation reached about 55%, which was 3 times higher than the system without glycerol. More importantly, during the photoelectrochemical water splitting in glycerol aqueous solution, in addition to the evolved hydrogen gas, glycerol was oxidized to valuable products with 15% dihydroxyacetone (DHA) and 85% formic acid. This strategy not only boosts the hydrogen production efficiency, keeps the photoanode very stable but also makes the biodiesel production more profitable and sustainable. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The Cu(OH)(2)-FTO electrode was then fabricated by a facile electrophoresis deposition method with the as-prepared Cu(OH)(2) nanobelts, which require no binding agents. By subsequent heat treatment at 300 degrees C for 2 h, the Cu(OH)(2)-FTO electrode was converted to the CuO-FTO electrode. The investigation of electrocatalysis of the Cu(OH)(2)-FTO and CuO-FTO electrodes for water oxidation was conducted in a 0.2 M phosphate buffer solution at pH 12. The CuO-FTO electrode can catalyze water oxidation with an impressive onset overpotential of 370 mV and an overpotential of 500 mV for a current density of 1 mA/cm(2) with a low Tafel slope of 57 mV/dec. This facile fabrication strategy is appealing for realizing the practical application of Cu-based electrocatalysts for water oxidation and is expected to be extended to prepare other heterocatalyst electrodes.									22	1	0	0	0	0	22			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:000427606100008

Insights from First-Principles								CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS				29	2			539	545		10.1021/acs.chemmater.6b03366				JAN 24 2017	2017	In view of its use in photocatalysis, we have here investigated several anion ordering models systems with the same chemical composition but different anionic arrangements of CaTaO2N and compared their chemical and physical features. We have found that the valence band structure varies as a function of the anion ordering, with a significant impact on the photocatalytic related properties, such as bandgaps, carrier effective masses, and band edge positions. In detail, from the comparison with two-dimensional ones, three-dimensional anion orderings have more positive valence band maximum positions, a more suitable condition for oxygen evolution reaction. By analyzing the electronic structures, we found that the difference in valence band structure among the anion orderings stems from the different orbital overlap between the Ta 5d and N 2p bands (d-p pi interactions): in two-dimensional anion orderings they cannot overlap due to their symmetry mismatch, while the lowered symmetry of N 2p bands in three-dimensional anion orderings allows the overlap with Ta 5d bands, inducing a net stabilization of the valence band.									46	1	0	0	0	0	45			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000392891700010

Density functional theory calculations showed that these compounds are direct-band-gap semiconductors. Close to the conduction band minimum, the main contribution to the band structure comes from the d orbitals of Zr or Ti ions, while the region near the valence band maximum is associated with the 3p orbitals of S ions. The absorption-edge wavelength was determined to be 540 nm for LTZSO and 700 nm for LTTSO and LNTSO. An analysis of the crystal structure using synchrotron X-ray diffraction revealed that these compounds contained antisite defects at transition metal ion sites, and these were considered to be the origin of the broad absorption at wavelengths longer than that corresponding to band-gap excitation. LTZSO was revealed to be active in the oxygen evolution reaction from aqueous solution containing a sacrificial electron acceptor under visible-light illumination. This result was supported by the band alignment and flat-band potential determined by photoelectron spectroscopy and Mott-Schottky plots.									20	2	0	0	1	0	20			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000373550700056	27008368

Pigment analysis showed that salinity decreased chlorophyll a and phycocyanin content, while low salinity increased carotenoid concentration and high salinity decreased carotenoid concentration. Salinity also inhibited CO, assimilation rate and photosynthetic oxygen evolution in this cyanobacterium. Chlorophyll a fluorescence transient parameters (phi Po, phi Eo, psi O, RC/ABS, RC/CS, PIABS, and PICS) were decreased under salt stress, while dVo/dto(Mo), Vj and phi Do were increased. The decrease of ETRmax and Yield and the change of chlorophyll a fluorescence transients showed that salt stress had an important influence on photosynthesis. These results indicated that the effects of salinity stress on photosynthesis in S. javanicum may depend on the inhibition of electron transport and the inactivation of the reaction centers, but this inhibition may occur in the electron transport pathway at the PSII donor and acceptor sites.

Three parts defined as transpassive dissolution, secondary passivity and oxygen evolution can be observed in the transpassive potential region of the anodic polarization Curves. In the whole transpassive region the nano-crystalline coating has a smaller corrosion current density than the bulk steel, which indicates the transpassive dissolution rate is decreased by nanocrystallization. In addition. there is an obvious difference in the surface micrographs of the two materials at transpassive potentials, as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows. The electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) reveals that nano-crystallization improves the homogeneity of Cr on the surface. Mott-Schottky plots displays that the carrier density of the oxide film in the transpassive region is decreased by nanocrystallization. Thus, the interfacial reactions are decelerated and the corrosion resistance of the stainless steel in the transpassive region has been greatly improved by nano-crystallization.

Unlike other oxides of transition metals, IrO2 shows a metallic type conductivity and displays a low surface work function. IrO2 is also characterized by a high chemical stability. These highly desirable properties make IrO2 a rightful candidate for specific applications. Furthermore, IrO2 can be synthesized in the form of a wide variety of nanostructures ranging from nanopowder, nanosheets, nanotubes, nanorods, nanowires, and nanoporous thin films. IrO2 nanostructuration, which allows its attractive intrinsic properties to be enhanced, can therefore be exploited according to the pursued application. Indeed, IrO2 nanostructures have shown utility in fields that span from electrocatalysis, electrochromic devices, sensors, fuel cell and supercapacitors. After a brief description of the IrO2 structure and properties, the present review will describe the main employed synthetic methodologies that are followed to prepare selectively the various types of nanostructures, highlighting in each case the advantages brought by the nanostructuration illustrating their performances and applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2304-6740		WOS:000845908500001

Taking into account the main feature of nitrous oxide, i.e., its ability to decompose exothermally, this Review summarizes also the conditions determining an explosive evolution of N2O decomposition, and the characteristic parameters of this process, as self-ignition or after ignition by local energy sources. For fuel- nitrous oxide explosive combustion, this Review is focused on conditions where the explosive combustion takes place (flammability limits, minimum ignition energy) or it is quenched (quenching distance, Maximum Experimental Safe Gap) and on the characteristic properties of explosion development and propagation. These properties are separately examined for deflagrations and detonations. The DDT (Deflagration-to-Detonation) process is also taken into account, because it occurs in most technical applications of fuel-N2O combustion in enclosures. This Review is completed by a discussion of processes where nitrous oxide is promoter of fuel-oxygen or fuel-air explosive combustion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0888-5885			WOS:000835216000001

However, to commercialize this technology, it has been focused on developing chlorine-less oxygen generating electrodes for decades. Here, different from common ideas of minimizing chlorine formation at the anode, we aimed at reusing the waste chlorine from seawater electrolysis to mitigate nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. NOx removal performance of electrolyzed seawater containing chlorine was investigated under 254 nm ultraviolet (UV) irradiation in a semi-continuous bubbling reactor. Comparative parametric experiments were conducted for each factor with and without UV irradiation. Significant contributions of UV irradiation on denitrification performance of chlorine were observed under all investigated conditions. A ten-folder improvement in denitrification efficiency by the UV irradiated electrolyzed seawater was achieved under optimal conditions.

The major challenges toward this end for experiment and computations are achieving sufficient cleanliness and modeling the complexity of electrochemical systems, respectively. In this sense, benchmarks of well-defined model systems are sparse. This work presents a rigorous joint experimental-theoretical study on the single-crystal (SC) Cu/aqueous interface. Within typical computational uncertainties, we find quantitative agreement between simulated and experimentally measured voltammograms, which allows us to unequivocally identify the *OH adsorption feature in the fingerprint region of Cu(110), Cu(100), and Cu(111) SCs under alkaline conditions. We find the inclusion of hydrogen evolution reaction kinetics in the theoretical model to be crucial for an accurate steady-state description that gives rise to a negligible H* coverage. A purely thermodynamic description of the H* coverage through a Pourbaix analysis would incorrectly lead to a H* adsorption peak. The presented results establish a fundamental benchmark for all electrochemical applications of Cu.									24	0	0	0	0	0	23			1948-7185			WOS:000515424300039	32022563

The effects of reaction temperature and B4C content on the phase composition and morphology of the products are investigated. The phase transition and morphological evolution of the products are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The results reveal that firstly V2O3 reacts with B4C to generate VB2, VC and B2O3, and then the by-products of VC and 8203 react with C to produce VB2. Owing to the evaporation loss of the B2O3, excess B4C should be added to avoid the formation of the boron deficient phases. Only when the V2O3/B4C/C molar ratio is close to 1:1.26:2, the single-phase VB2 could be prepared which has the residual carbon and oxygen contents of 0.34 wt% and 1.4 wt%, respectively. The particles of VB2 powders obtained at 1773 K display a plate-like morphology with a size of approximately 0.1-0.8 mu m.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000453492800127

Different from the usual methods for developing high-performance CE materials through searching new materials and designing new nanostructure, we utilized a rapid surface sulfurization treatment to activate the well-known Co3O4 material by increasing the adsorption energy of iodine (I) atom in the electrolyte of DSSCs. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicated the adsorption energy of Co3O4 (E-ad(I) 0.347 eV) toward I atom was dramatically increased to 0.835 eV through just transforming Co3O4 at surface into Co3S4. After a short activation time of 30 s, Co3O4 CEs showed a superior catalytic performance toward iodide electrolyte comparable with traditional Pt CE, generating a power conversion efficiency of 8.6% in DSSCs. This method of adjusting adsorption energy via surface sulfurization is applicable in the activation of other metal oxides, and provides a convenient but efficient way to modify the simple abundant materials for their different electrocatalytic applications.									19	1	0	0	1	0	19			1932-7447			WOS:000403731700002

Mesoporous IrO_2/[Ti_(100-x) V_x] O_2{x =0,1,5) were prepared through Evaporation-Induced Self-Assembly (EISA). By Adams fusion method, nano-sized IrO_2 was synthesized at the surface of mesoporous [Ti_(100-x) V_x] O_2 with different doping amount. XRD and TEM results show that the phase transition of the doped titania from anatase to rutile structure takes place with Adams fusion, and grain grows. However the grain growth is restricted with V amount rising.

The results show that the reaction rate of magnesium alloy with phytic acid was fastest under pH=1, followed by pH=2 and pH=6 during the formation process of the conversion coatings. The coating surface formed under pH=1 was fragmentized and had some big cracks. Some cracks were also on the surface of the coating formed under pH=2 and the cracks were small and uniform. The sample was entirely covered under pH=6 and the conversion coating was thin. The conversion coating mainly consisted of the compounds of magnesium, aluminum, zinc, oxygen and phosphorus. The conversion coating formed under pH=2 had higher corrosion resistance than that of the conversion coatings formed under pH=1 and 6 and the treated samples with phytic acid has better corrosion resistance than untreated sample.					7th National Conference on Functional Materials and Applications7th National Conference on Functional Materials and Applications	OCT, 2010OCT, 2010		Hunan, PEOPLES R CHINAHunan, PEOPLES R CHINA	3	1	0	0	0	0	3					978-1-935068-41-9	WOS:000289704100330

These microcapsules can be transferred from the solution surface to the surface of the nickel electrode using the vertical elevator technique. The study of the electrochemical properties of such electrodes has shown that they are active electrocatalysts in the oxygen evolution reaction during water electrolysis in an alkaline medium and they are characterized by the overpotential value of 280 mV and Tafel slope of 69.1 mV/dec.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1070-3632	1608-3350		WOS:000769468600019

An improved chemical treatment based on alkaline KOH solution was carried out. A limited degradation of the functional groups was observed allowing to maintain a good anion conductivity approaching 55 mS cm-1 at 100 degrees C. Thermal stability up to 200 degrees C was assessed by thermal analysis.A specific membrane-electrodes assembly based on FAA3-50 anionic membrane and NiMn2O4 anode catalyst was developed and investigated in a single cell for water electrolysis at a moderate temperature (50 degrees C).Performance stability was assessed by a potential cycling-based durability test for 1000 h by varying the cell potential between 1 and 1.8 V for the FAA3-50 and NiMn2O4 based-MEA.According to this evaluation, both the FAA3-50 membrane and the NiMn2O4 catalyst appear sufficiently stable for electrolysis operation under mild operating temperatures.

However, the conventional AACVD method is time-consuming because post-annealing treatment is usually required after WO3 film was deposited under nitrogen flow. Therefore, we omitted the post-annealing treatment by employing purified air as carrier gas (known as one-step) instead of nitrogen (known as two-step) which decreases the fabrication time by 13-fold. One-step WO3 also shows improved charge separation and PEC reaction due to the coexistence of (0 0 2), (0 2 0) and (2 0 0) facets and higher oxygen vacancies. Further optimiza-tion using acetone/ethanol as solvent, 10 min deposition time and 450 degrees C deposition temperature leads to photocurrent density of 0.32 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE, which is the highest performance reported for AACVD-based WO3 photoanode. The development of rapid and industrially applicable deposition method would pave the way for real practice of PEC technology. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The theoretically highly active hematite-based photoanode still requires modification from inside to outside to conquer ultrafast carrier recombination and a high reaction barrier. Herein, we report a uniform and ultrathin cocatalyst with coordinated tannic acid, Ni, Fe, and Co (TA-NFC), for enhancing photoelectrochemical performance of the Fdoped Fe2O3 nanorod (NR) photoanode. The F-doping in the structure fulfills more carrier density and lower charge transfer resistance for accelerating photogenerated electron and hole separation. Furthermore, the TA-NFC cocatalyst on the surface assists hole injection and supports faster water oxidation kinetic. Ultimately, the photocurrent density of F-Fe2O3@TA-NFC NRs sharply increased up to 3.02 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V versus RHE, and the applied-bias photon-to-current efficiency reached 0.33% maximum at low bias. This work may supply a novel and promising design scheme for improving the intrinsic photoelectrochemical activity of semiconductor-based photoanodes.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2168-0485			WOS:000703351200033

Polyoxometalates (POMs) are promising water oxidation catalysts in a neutral medium but their application is commonly limited by low electrical conductivity and poor adhesiveness arising from bulky and electrically insulating ligands. Here we report linker-free spontaneous binding of tetracobalt-based poly-oxometalates (Co4POMs) on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) via electrostatic hybridization. Protonated nitrogen-dopant sites at NCNTs enable linker-free immobilization of the Co4POMs and fluent electron transfer in the resultant Co4POM/NCNT hybrid structures, as demonstrated by the low overpotential of 370 mV for the water oxidation at pH 7. Accordingly, the hybrids exhibit fast reaction kinetics with a turnover frequency of 0.211 s(-1) at 2.01 V vs. RHE. Density functional theory calculation proposes that POMs vertically align at the NCNT surface exposing the maximal catalytic surfaces. This work suggests a reliable route to highly efficient water oxidation catalysis by employing POMs under neutral conditions and NCNTs as self-binding nanoelectrodes in a synergistic well-oriented hybrid structure.									38	1	0	0	3	0	38			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000395074300013

As-deposited and annealed (500 degrees C) films are compared and shown to be photoactive for the formation of hypochlorite in neutral aqueous NaCl (e.g., seawater). Annealing at 500 degrees C in air improves photocurrents most likely due to improved interparticle charge transport (e.g., removal of hydration or n-hexanol surface layers). In phototransients (interpreted here in the limiting case of a weakly associated nanoparticle aggregate as opposed to the limiting case of a single-crystal semiconductor), evidence for the presence of both holes (as O(-I), fast moving) and electrons (as W(V), slow moving) is obtained in particular in as-deposited films. Bipotentiostat experiments reveal the presence of chlorine as a reaction intermediate close to the photoanode when immersed in 3 M NaCl. A molecular conduit effect with adsorbed Co(II/III) sepulchrate is observed to significantly enhance the photocurrents at as-deposited electrodes (but not at annealed electrodes).									22	0	0	0	2	0	22			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000317552200013

The presence of potassium ions in the as-synthesized titanate nanowires was required for maintenance of the nanowire structure under the conditions of post-heat treatment. The crystallite structure, composition, morphology, specific surface area, pore volume distribution, and optical properties were found to be dependent on the temperature at which titanate nanowires were calcined. Photocatalytic activity was examined using three probe reactions: oxidative decomposition of acetic acid in an aqueous solution, oxygen liberation from an aqueous silver sulfate solution, and hydrogen liberation from an aqueous methanol solution in the presence of hexachloroplatinic acid as a precursor of photodeposition of platinum particles. Detailed characterization and results of photocatalytic activity tests revealed that titanate crystallites greatly contributed to the photocatalytic activities of the calcined nanowires except for photocatalytic hydrogen liberation. It was found that platinum was preferentially photodeposited on anatase crystallites rather than on titanate crystallites for hydrogen liberation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The high activity of single-atom catalysts is mainly due to their low-coordination environment of metal centers, quantum size effect, and metalsupport interaction. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop a general and simple synthetic pathway for highperformance single-atom catalysts based on the structure-activity relationship. Considering industrial applications, wet chemistry synthesis has been considered a promising method for the preparation of single-atom catalysts owing to its simplicity and practicality of massive production. A series of strategies have also been developed for the prepara. tion of supported single-atom catalysts. In this review, we summarized the unique freezing synthetic method to synthe. size single-atom materials from the perspective of inhibiting the nucleation of metal species. We further systematically discuss the synthesis mechanism and the catalytic mechanism of the prepared supported single-atom catalysts for extensive applications. Finally, some prospects on the trend of future research in this respect are given.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0251-0790			WOS:000862778500016

The designable structure and specific functionality make them stand out for diverse applications. In conceptual MOF, the metal ions/clusters and organic ligands are perfectly coordinated to form a network framework as an ideal crystal structure. However, in reality, uncoordinated metal and ligands or vacancies in the crystal structure are already confirmed and known as defects. Defects in the MOF structure have inner effects on the functional properties and uniquely influence the MOF's applications. Thus, besides various methods for MOF development, the strategy of structural design, and functionalization, manufacturing defects in MOF could be another modification strategy of MOFs. These tailorable strategies to induce defects in the MOF structure not only change the MOFs properties but also improved the performance in various applications. This review overviews the progress of strategies for inducing structural defects, aiming to provide knowledge for defective MOFs. Subsequently, the influence of these methods on the MOFs properties and applications, especially adsorption and catalysis, were discussed.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000794338000001	35551351

The catalytic process circumvents expensive electron transporters such as NAD(P)H, making it advantageous for green production of fine chemicals with complex structures. In situ generation and collaborative supplement of H2O2 is strongly desired for an improved productivity and enzyme stability. The present study describes a novel CPO cascade for asymmetric hydroxylation of ethylbenzene yielding (R)-1-phenylethanol, in which H2O2 is generated by oxidation of monosaccharides catalyzed by gold nanoclusters (AuNCs). A core-shell structure of CPO-AuNCs cascade was prepared by using hollow mesoporous silica microspheres (HMSMs) as the support. AuNCs were immobilized on the external surface of HMSMs while CPOs were encapsulated inside the microspheres. Different monosaccharides were examined for H2O2 production as a function of the particle size. It was found that galactose exhibits the highest productivity. The high compatibility of CPO and AuNCs against temperature and pH is advantageous in catalyzing a wide spectrum of reactions for C-H functionalization.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000744306600001

Such a photosynthesis-assisted strengthening behavior in plants has rarely been imitated in synthetic material systems. We here propose a synthetic polymer system embedded with extracted plant chloroplasts, which allow for the photosynthesis-assisted mechanical strengthening of the polymer matrix. The strengthening mechanism relies on an additional crosslinking reaction between the photosynthesis-produced glucose and side groups within the polymer matrix. We develop a theoretical framework to model the photosynthesis-assisted strengthening behaviors of polymers. The glucose production of the embedded chloroplasts will be first modeled with a general photosynthesis theory, and the exportation of glucose to the polymer matrix is modeled with an enzyme-assisted mass transport theory. Next, a polymer strengthening network model with glucose molecules as additional crosslinkers is presented. Effects of the illumination period, the concentration of embedded chloroplasts, and the light intensity on the stiffness strengthening are studied. The theoretical results consistently agree with the experimental results of the photosynthesis-assisted polymer strengthening.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-5096	1873-4782		WOS:000645446400004

By increasing the bias voltage, a monotonic decrease in the Br radical density was observed irrespective of the surface material (Si, Al2O3) of the wafer. A drastic increase in Br radical density was observed after O-2 addition to HBr/Ar plasma in the case of a bare Si wafer, whereas almost the same density was observed in the case of an Al2O3-sputtered Si wafer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicated that O-2 addition promotes oxide formation on the Si surface. Measurement of the decay time constant for a Br radical after turning off the plasma indicated that O-2 addition results in a longer decay time constant, suggesting the decrease of the surface loss probability of Br radicals for the surface-oxidized Si surface.

For an economical use of water and solar energy, catalysts that are sufficiently efficient, stable, inexpensive and capable of harvesting light are required. Here, we show that an abundant material, polymeric carbon nitride, can produce hydrogen from water under visible-light irradiation in the presence of a sacrificial donor. Contrary to other conducting polymer semiconductors, carbon nitride is chemically and thermally stable and does not rely on complicated device manufacturing. The results represent an important first step towards photosynthesis in general where artificial conjugated polymer semiconductors can be used as energy transducers.									8600	642	5	0	766	2	8856			1476-1122			WOS:000261866700023	18997776

Vojnosanitetski pregled				55	5			463	8						1998 Sep-Oct	1998	The aim of this study was to determine the baseline state of oxidative stress indices in drug-naive patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood samples of 31 subjects, in disease stages I-III, according to Hoehn & Yahr scale, were analyzed and compared with the control group. Highly significant increase of malondialdehyde content in CSF (p < 0.001) was found, as well as significant differences in peripheral blood parameters: malondialdehyde content was increased in patients with PD (p < 0.05), and also the activities of antioxidative defense enzymes, gluthathion reductase, Cu, Zn-superoxide-dismutase (p < 0.05), and the production of highly reactive oxygen species-superoxide radical (p < 0.05). Those findings indicated the important role of oxidative stress in Parkinson's disease evolution and progress. The findings of increased amount of reactive oxidative species (malondialdehyde content and superoxide radical production) in peripheral blood, and excessive activity of protective enzymatic systems (gluthathion reductase Cu, Zn-superoxid-dismutase) suggested the additional systemic reaction related to chronic oxidative stress state in the brain.									19	1	0	0	11	0	20			0042-8450			MEDLINE:9921070	9921070

Multi-layer coatings were deposited by spin coating onto fused silica slides with and without an intermediate, 200 nm thick, vacuum deposited Ti film. Samples heat treated at 200, 300, and 400-degrees-C were studied by several techniques (Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS), elastic recoil detection, (ERD), nuclear reaction analysis (NRA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and x-ray diffraction (XRD) to characterize morphological and compositional changes and to test the reproducibility of the preparation method. In all cases a single crystalline phase, the solid solution of the two component oxides, was detected by XRD. The films appeared to have a low density, and hydrogen and carbon were still found in the coatings after each heat treatment; their content was reduced only at 400-degrees-C for samples B and C.

However, piezocatalysis efficiency optimization remains a struggle. Polarized Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O-3 (PZT), with its non-centrosymmetry structure and high ferroelectric polarisation, offers enormous promise as a piezocatalyst amongst other piezoelectric materials. We evaluated the piezocatalytic effectiveness of the as-prepared samples by analysing the breakdown of rhodamine B (RB), methylene blue (MB) and their equimolar composition aquous solutions in the dark using ultrasonic vibration. The results revealed that poled PZT exhibits significantly improved piezocatalytic activity for MB and RB decomposition. The degradation of MB and RB, as well as the probable by-products and active radical species created in the piezocatalytic system, were studied in detail. Additionally, the effect of residual polarisation on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for alkaline fuel cells was also studied . An explanation for the enhanced effect of polarization on the piezocatalytic performance of PZT was given based on the experimental data.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2468-0230			WOS:000765012400001

Initially, vertically aligned ZnO nanorods structures were developed over conductive substrates by a two-step approach and then passivated with an ultrathin zinc hydroxide, that is, Zn(OH)(2), cobalt oxide, that is, CoO, and Zn(OH)(2)/CoO as bilayer, by electrochemical deposition. Compared with the pristine ZnO structures, the surface-passivated nano structures possess slightly rough surfaces, whereas their crystal structure remains unchanged. From electrochemical catalysis studies under dark and illumination, it is noticed that vertically aligned ZnO nanostructures passivated with narrow band-gap CoO layers have a predominant water oxidation performance than that of the structures passivated with other oxide materials. It is mainly attributed to the eradication of surface states present on ZnO nanorods. Interestingly, the structures passivated with bilayers, that is, Zn(OH)(2)/CoO, showed significant stability and durability (similar to 103% retention in current density@60th min) with a continuous oxygen evolution reaction process for long durations.

However, the degradation of semiconductor-based photoelectrodes during PEC reactions is one of the largest limitations for the application of PEC devices. Facing this challenge, the most prevailing strategy is to construct the protection layer on the surface of semiconductor for insulating the semiconductor from the electrolyte. The development of defect engineering in the protection layer is used to further addresses the issues from the introduction of new layer, including light transmission, charge transfer, interfacial recombination and surface activity. This review aims to discuss recent advances in the defect engineering of protection layer for PEC devices. The types, characterization, role and utilization of the defects in the protection layer are discussed and summarized. Finally, the critical challenges and future perspective towards the development of the defect engineering of protection layer for PEC devices are analyzed.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2589-7780			WOS:000646907200003

While some of the above complexes display good catalytic activity, their performance often suffers from much larger overpotentials than the extremely efficient, but not sustainable metal, platinum. Intrigued by the report of copper corroles as catalysts for the electrochemical conversion of protons to hydrogen gas, we hypothesized that trifluoromethylation of corroles would be most effective for inducing a positive shift of the potentials required for reduction of the copper chelated thereby. A combination of methodologies allowed for full characterization of the tris- and tetra-CF3-substituted complexes and elucidation of their unique structural, physical, and chemical properties. The desired outcome was also achieved, as the potential required for reduction to the copper(I) oxidation state, postulated to be the catalytically active species, was the least negative. The tris-substituted complex was found to be a particularly good electrocatalyst for production of hydrogen from protons, with a remarkably early catalytic onset potential.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2574-0962			WOS:000526598300084

The mechanism of crystallographic phase variation of the POM-amino pyridine hybrids under different pH was studied through controlled experiments where the final hydrolyzed products were analyzed through NMR and single crystal X-ray diffraction. Different pH conditions led to variation in the extent of protonation and hydrolyzation of the ligand, yielding different phases. All of these were identified, and the structures of the supramolecular hybrids were characterized extensively. Mechanistic study proved that only the reaction conditions are responsible for the hydrolysis of the ligand and the in situ generated POM species do not have any role in it. Magnetic measurements confirmed the hexavalent oxidation states of the transition metal center (Mo) in the POM. Optical band gap measurements revealed that these hybrids are semiconducting in nature. Two of the compounds were studied for hydrogen peroxide mediated selective oxidation catalysis of small organic molecules and found to exhibit very good activity with high percentage of selectivity for the desired products of industrial importance.									8	2	0	0	0	0	9			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000422810900010	29272117

Here we investigate possibility of considerable contribution of the neutrino-He-4 interaction to the weak r-process component. We assume that a large-scale convective mixing could occur between the He and C-O-Ne shells in core-collapse supernovae. In that case some He-4 would be exposed to the neutrino radiation at a radius smaller than that predicted for He shell by standard pre-supernova models. Our calculations demonstrate that for metal-poor stars the neutrino contribution to creation of the weak r-process component becomes noticeable in case He-4 is dragged down at radii R less than or similar to 10(9) cm.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000336249300054

These properties depend on the residual paraffin wax binder content and on the chemical nature of the binder, which changes drastically if the wick-debinding takes place in air at a temperature above 190 degrees C. Under these conditions, the paraffin binder undergoes a transformation, as a result of complex exothermic chemical reactions with oxygen. Part of it forms volatile products, while the remaining part cures into a nonvolatile, brown-colored, solid substance, which resides in the wick-debinded part and bonds the powder particles firmly together. The curing can be beneficial, as strong wick-debinded parts with bending strengths up to 14 MPa, containing less than 2% of the residual binder, can be obtained without flaws. The strength of the partially debinded parts increases with the dwelling time at 200 degrees C, whereas the binder content reaches a minimum value of about 1.6% and then remains constant with the dwell time. Strong debinded parts can be easily manipulated and can be rapidly sintered due to the low amount of the residual organic phase.									20	2	1	0	0	1	23			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000298735300033

Some factors are responsible for well-preserved condition, for example, low temperature which can slow down the rate of chemical and biological reactions, enclosure during soil freezing which can resist oxygen diffusing, lack of liquid water and ice-cement which can reduce the diagenesis in sedimentation. In this review, the possibility of ancient DNA retrieving from the biological remains buried in cold regions and the summarize methods for extraction, purification and amplification of ancient DNA are discussed. In the same time, many famous studies of ancient DNA on mammoth, penguin, brown bear, etc are also introduced. These studies described the genetic relationship between ancient species and their modern one, the spatial and geographic patterns about the migration and separation in past and molecular evolution rate of particular species in individual, population and time-dependent population scales. It is clear that low temperature and consequent process makes for good preservation. Thus studying the remains from cold regions is clearly a wise decision if one wants to retrieve ancient DNA.			寒区埋藏环境常年处于负温条件下，土壤冻结或冰的形成过程产生封闭作用，可以隔离造成埋藏生物遗体同DNA氧化分解的氧气之间的接触。由于液态水含量极大地减少和冰胶结作用，使得主要依赖于液态水而发生的生物大分子的化学分解以及生物降解反应作用减慢，有机体没有成岩过程中降解以及水解作用，从而使古DNA分子可以得到较好的保存。目前绝大多数关于古DNA研究的重要成果所使用生物材料均来自寒区环境，最为引人注目的有关猛犸象、棕熊和企鹅化石古DNA的研究。这些研究分别从个体、种群和同一种群在不同时间尺度上描绘了它们与现代生物种之间的亲缘关系、过去发生的生物迁移和空间隔离以及特定生物分子水平上的时间演化。从目前来看，大量的生物标本很好地保存在那里，以至于单一考贝基因都可以获得，因此是获取古DNA并获得相应遗传信息的理想地区。						0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1000-0240			CSCD:1011364

ULTRASONICS SONOCHEMISTRY				69						105238	10.1016/j.ultsonch.2020.105238				DEC 2020	2020	In this study, we investigated the effects of power ultrasound (26 kHz, up to similar to 75 W/cm(2), up to 100% acoustic amplitude, ultrasonic horn) on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on a platinum (Pt) polycrystalline disc electrode in 0.5 M H2SO4 by cyclic and linear sweep voltammetry at 298 K. We also studied the formation of molecular hydrogen (H-2) bubbles on a Pt wire in the absence and presence of power ultrasound using ultra-fast camera imaging. It was found that ultrasound significantly increases currents towards the HER i.e. a similar to 250% increase in current density was achieved at maximum ultrasonic power. The potential at a current density of -10 mA/cm(2) under silent conditions was found to be -46 mV and decreased to -27 mV at 100% acoustic amplitude i.e. a Delta E shift of similar to+20 mV, indicating the influence of ultrasound on improving the HER activity. A nearly 100% increase in the exchange current density (j(o)) and a 30% decrease in the Tafel slope (b) at maximum ultrasonic power, was observed in the low overpotential region, although in the high overpotential region, the Tafel slopes (b) were not significantly affected when compared to silent conditions. In our conditions, ultrasound did not greatly affect the "real" surface area (A(r)) and roughness factor (R) i.e. the microscopic surface area available for electron transfer. Overall, it was found that ultrasound did not dramatically change the mechanism of HER but instead, increased currents at the Pt surface area through effective hydrogen bubble removal.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1350-4177	1873-2828		WOS:000567794500009	32623347

Studies showed that the temperature of electrochemical synthesis of binary sulfides has a great effect on their structure and behavior. Therefore, electrochemical synthesizes were performed at different temperatures from 30 to 80 degrees C and different concentrations of Thioacetamide. Modified electrodes with NiCo2S4 nanosheet arrays at different temperatures and concentrations were used for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By using the proposed method, the onset potential for oxidation of water was significantly reduced to 1.42 V versus RHE electrode, and a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) was obtained at a scanning rate of 50 mV s(-1). Tafel slope of the modified electrode was calculated 26 mV.dec(-1). This study was performed in KOH 0.1 M electrolyte using linear sweeping voltammetry. Also, to describe the characteristics and morphology of the synthesized modifier, the electrode surface was examined by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000861065900001

ACS applied materials & interfaces											10.1021/acsami.2c14274				2022-Oct-31	2022	Scalable assembly of nanocrystals (NCs) into two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets has aroused great interest, yet it remains under-explored. This is because current 2D assembly methods rely mainly on the use of solid- or liquid-air interfaces, which are inherently difficult for upscaling and thus lack practicability. Here, with a microemulsion-based amphiphilic assembly technique, we achieve a fast and scalable preparation of free-standing nanosheets comprising few-layer, tightly packed NCs, namely, quasi-nanosheets (quasi-NSs). Acetic acid, acting as both solvent and surface-treatment agent, is used to render the initially hydrophobic NCs amphiphilic, while simultaneously inducing the interfacial instability right after the assembly of NCs at the emulsion interface to afford quasi-NSs. This amphiphilic assembly method is applicable to a variety of NCs, and multicomponent quasi-NSs are also attainable upon coassembly of different types of NCs. In addition, the structural advantages of quasi-NSs in catalysis are showcased by using NiFe2O4 quasi-NSs as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. This work opens a new route for the scalable construction of 2D NC sheets with designated components and functions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1944-8252		MEDLINE:36315871	36315871	
J	Ran, Hongpei; Du, Huiling; Ma, Cuiying; Zhao, Yingying; Feng, Danni; Xu, Hang								Effects of A/B-Site Co-Doping on Microstructure and Dielectric Thermal Stability of AgNbO3 Ceramics								SCIENCE OF ADVANCED MATERIALS				13	5			741	747		10.1166/sam.2021.3943				MAY 2021	2021	AgNbO3-based lead-free ceramics are a promising candidate material for capacitors, where thermal stability is a key property for applications in severe and complex environments. This study investigated the fabrication of Ag1-3xBixNb1-3/5x(Zn1/2Ti1/2)(x)O-3 (ABNZT-x) (x = 0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, or 0.04) via a solid-state reaction under oxygen flow. The microstructure, dielectric properties, and impedance spectra of the AgNbO3 samples co-doped with Bi3+ Zn2+, and Ti4+ were systematically characterized. All samples exhibited an orthorhombic phase structure, where the average grain size decreased with increasing co-doping level, the grain growth kinetics was studied by phase-field simulation. The phase transition temperatures became lower and the maximum permittivity values decreased. These findings demonstrated that enhanced dielectric thermal stability had been achieved. The grain conduction effect was observed during the impedance spectroscopy analysis, where the calculated activation energy decreased with increasing co-doping level. This ABNZT-x ceramic system exhibited stable dielectric properties, and shows promise for use as a functional material in electronic devices.									64	0	1	0	3	0	64			1947-2935	1947-2943		WOS:000675845100001

Herein, an amorphous CoOx-decorated crystalline RuO2 nanosheet catalyst self-supported on nickel foam (CoOx-RuO2/NF) with high performance for both oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER and HER) is prepared successfully by hydrothermal method and annealing. The overpotentials at +/- 1500 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER are 420 and 215 mV, respectively, in 1.0 M KOH solution. Remarkably, it shows good durability with small decline in performance after 48 h durability test for OER and HER at +/- 1500 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, it only needs 1.49 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting (OWS); the decline of activity is satisfactory after 48 h durability test at 1500 mA cm(-2). The reason could be because of the sufficient active sites generated by the crystalline-amorphous combination and self-supporting nanosheet structure. This work therefore proposes an effective strategy for preparing a high-performance OWS catalyst, especially at large current density.									49	3	0	0	4	0	50			2168-0485			WOS:000595593500020

Interestingly, it acts as a robust electrocatalyst in water oxidation at similar to 0.58 V overpotential with a faradaic efficiency of 97.50% under neutral buffered conditions. The catalyst is impressively stable even after long-term bulk electrolysis, and homogeneous in nature, as established by a series of experiments and characterization techniques.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000514651200007	31957765

Part I. Transformation of GC-detectable light species during the hydrotreatment of bio-oil using Pd/C catalyst								FUEL				111				709	717		10.1016/j.fuel.2013.04.002				SEP 2013	2013	Bio-oil cannot be directly used as biofuel mainly due to its abundant oxygen-containing functional groups. Therefore, bio-oil must be upgraded to produce high quality biofuels. As the first part of this series, this paper reports the transformation of GC-detectable light components during the hydrotreatment of bio-oil using noble-metal catalyst Pd/C over a wide range of reaction temperature (150-300 degrees C). Our results show that aldehydes were easily hydrogenated, with cyclopentanone and 2-methyl cyclopentanone among the observed products. During hydrotreatment, carboxylic acids such as propionic, butanoic and pentanoic acids were also observed in the liquid products. Furthermore, evolution of propyl guaiacol, ethyl guaiacol, methyl guaiacol, guaiacol and syringol confirms the depolymerisation of the lignin-derived oligomers during the hydrotreatment of bio-oil. The hydrogenation of the phenolic compounds also took place. In addition, the FT-IR analysis of the O-containing functional groups, especially carbonyl groups, confirms the trends found by GC-MS.

The simulators are plumbed and instrumented for detailed geochemical, geophysical, and microbiological data collection; and are sized and shaped to address some limitations of standard laboratory apparatus and protocols. Design and materials details are given along with preliminary data from the first year of a prototype experiment on baseline geochemistry and geophysics using dump material from a quartz/base-metal vein mine. The prototype tank has been taken through two WED cycles from August 1997 to August 1998 and is showing some geochemical and mineralogical parallels with the parent mine dump. Low pH effluent with high total disserved solids (TDS) is produced within 30 minutes of addition of deionized (DI) water, and evolution of Fe2+, Fe3+, and dissolved oxygen (DO) suggest interesting chemistry and perhaps microbiology occur within the simulator. Preliminary interpretation of geophysical data collected during WED cycles suggest that self-potential (SP) anomalies are associated with oxidation-reduction reactions occurring near the boundary between the saturated and unsaturated zones.					6th International Conference on Tailing and Mine Waste 996th International Conference on Tailing and Mine Waste 99	JAN 24-27, 1999JAN 24-27, 1999		COLORADO STATE UNIV, FT COLLINS, COCOLORADO STATE UNIV, FT COLLINS, CO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					90-5809-025-6	WOS:000078186900049

Herein, we analyze the different reactivitiesof NiOOH and Cu(OH)2toward the electrochemical oxidation of alcohol andaldehyde on the furan ring and utilize their characteristics synergistically toenhance the performance of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) conversion. We discovered that Cu(OH)2hashigher reactivity for the oxidation of aldehyde to carboxylic acid than NiOOH,while NiOOH exhibited excellent reactivity toward the oxidation of alcohol toaldehyde. Furthermore, NiOOH-Cu(OH)2mixed electrodes showed higheractivity and faster conversion of HMF to FDCA than individual NiOOH orCu(OH)2electrodes. The alcohol oxidation of HMF is initiated by NiOOH,and Cu(OH)2quickly converts the remaining aldehydes to carboxylic acids atthe NiOOH/Cu(OH)2interface. Further enhancement of the HMF oxidationkinetics of NiOOH/Cu(OH)2was achieved by preparing a nanofoam structure comprising nanoscale pores and nanodendriticframes, showing instantaneous conversion to FDCA without producing unreacted intermediates.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000784255800033

In this work, nickel foam (NiF)-based rod-like absorbers with double dielectric regulation were achieved via continuous hydrothermal reaction and subsequent heating treatment. The NiFbased uniform integration of binary metal oxides not only maintain the inherent excellent dielectric property of NiF, but also introduce extra dipolar polarizations (caused by multiple covered dielectrics) and Maxwell-WagnerSillars effect (induced by large dielectric property differences at the interfaces), which all contribute to the excellent microwave absorption performance. In addition, derived from the high/low dielectric synergetic effect, a balance between the introduction and dissipation of the electromagnetic energy can be realized. Based on that, the maximum bandwidth of NiF-based binary absorber reaches 7.28 GHz at 2.4 mm. This work not only provides a facile and versatile strategy to fabricate NiF-based ternary microwave absorbers, but also demonstrates the significant role of dielectric synergetic effect in optimizing microwave absorption performance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000708565400001

However, most MOFs are characterized by low electronic conductivity limiting their use as bulk materials for anodes and cathodes. Furthermore, the understanding of the critical parameters controlling the activity and stability of MOF electrocatalysts is still insufficient. Herein, a systematic analysis is presented of the key structural parameters controlling the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance and stability of a representative family of bimetallic NiFe-MOFs, where the role of the metal cations on the accessible active sites and intrinsic activity can be investigated independently from the crystal structure. The models and in-depth structural and morphological characterizations reveal a hierarchy of properties affecting the OER activity with accessible sites and intrinsic activity playing a major role in the charge transfer efficiency. Optimization of these properties and addition of a conductive support substrate leads to efficient MOF-nanocomposite electrocatalysts achieving a low overpotential of 258 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1) and excellent stability for more than 32 h of continuous OER in alkaline medium.									55	1	0	0	4	0	55			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000624574200001

In this work, mesoporous alpha-Fe2O3 thin film photoanodes coated with manganese oxide (Mn3O4+delta) co-catalysts are prepared by a dip-coating method. The co-catalyst coating significantly enhances PEC water oxidation performance as compared with the uncoated alpha-Fe2O3. To understand the origin of this enhancement, in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy is employed to monitor the valence state of Mn in the Mn3O4+delta co-catalyst as a function of applied potential. It is found that the enhancement of the photocurrent is governed by the Mn valency, and the most prominent enhancement takes place at the valency of similar to 3.4+, which is due to the optimal e(g) electron filling in Mn cations as the electrocatalyst for OER Our investigation indicates that the contribution of Mn3O4+delta co-catalyst to OER kinetics is variable at different applied potentials.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			2574-0962			WOS:000458705100073

Here, we take into consideration the multiple effects that a thin layer of photodeposited amorphous Ni-oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) induces on hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) photo-anodes. The reduction of overpotential produced a photocurrent onset potential advance of 150 mV and an increase of photocurrent of about 50% at 1.23 V vs RHE. To give an interpretation to these phenomena, we carried out deep electrochemical investigations by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The effective charge injection into the electrolyte due to the reduction of the charge transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface was observed and increased along with the amount of deposited NiOOH. The benefits of NiOOH deposition are ascribable to its ability to scavenge holes from hematite surface traps. This effect is mitigated at a potential higher than 1.25 V, since a fraction of photogenerated holes is consumed into the Ni redox cycle.									188	4	0	0	12	0	188			2155-5435			WOS:000361089700036

The OER catalyst over-layers with thicknesses ranging from approximate to 0.1 to approximate to 50 nm were vapor deposited onto PR ex situ. STEM images demonstrated that, with increasing thickness, Ru and Ir transform from amorphous clusters to crystalline nanoparticles, which agglomerate with increased over-layer thickness. XPS data showed a strong interaction between Ru and PR. Ir also interacts with PR although not to the extent seen for Ru. At low coverages, the entire Ru deposit was in the reacted state while a small portion of the deposited Ir remained metallic. Ru and Ir bonding occur at the PR carbonyl sites as evidenced by the attenuation of carbonyl photoemission and the emergence of new peak assigned to C-O single bonds. Curve fitting analysis and the derived stoichiometry indicated the formation of metallo organic bonds. The co-existence of oxide bonds was also apparent.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0352-5139			WOS:000329261200013

ZnO nanomaterials need surface passivation with different water-insoluble compounds. This study describes a one-step passivation process of polycrystalline ZnO films with ZnS as a facile method of ZnO surface coating. A simple sulfidation reaction was carried out in gas-phase H2S and it resulted in formation of a ZnS thin layer on the ZnO surface. The ZnS layer not only inhibited the ZnO dissolving process in water but additionally improved its mechanical and electrical properties. After the passivation process, ZnO/ZnS films remained stable in water for over seven days. The electrical conductivity of the ZnO films increased about 500-fold as a result of surface defect passivation and the removal of oxygen molecules which can trap free carriers. The nanohardness and Young's modulus of the samples increased about 64% and 14%, respectively after the ZnS coating formation. Nanowear tests performed using nanoindentation methods revealed reduced values of surface displacements for the ZnO/ZnS system. Moreover, both ZnO and ZnO/ZnS films showed antimicrobial properties against Escherichia coli.									14	0	0	0	3	0	14			2046-2069			WOS:000440243600037	35539207

The results suggest that free radicals derived from saturated C-H and C-C bonds whichare attacked by oxygen atoms form slowly at the early stage of thermal aging. And it is a key step to determine the reactionspeed. After that, the carbonyl species are generated rapidly, which results in formation of aldehydes, ketonesand esters etc. and finally by degradation and oxidative. Based on a full understanding on the thermal-oxidative agingmechanism of butyl rubber, we constructed elementary reaction equations and furthermore, oxidation kinetic modelsaccording to mass action law of each elementary equation.

In this work, amorphous MoO2 with a porous nanostructure as a novel bifunctional electrocatalyst has been prepared by the hydrothermal method. This nanostructure has excellent HER/OER properties, in which the amorphous and porous states have a large number of vacancies and active sites exposed to the electrolyte. The as-prepared sample has been researched in detail via X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Electrochemical experiments show that when the current density reaches - 10 mA cm(-2), the as-prepared samples need an overpotential of only about - 0.930 V (vs. RHE) in 1 M H2SO4 and - 0.777 V (vs. RHE) in 1 M KOH for HER, respectively. Furthermore, MoO2 exhibits an extremely overpotential of 2.414 V (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH for OER. It is believed that the amorphous and porous nanostructure remains a promising and efficient hydrolytic electrocatalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0947-8396	1432-0630		WOS:000817298700001

The use of these compounds as photocatalysts and photoelectrodes is still a strong challenge due to bulk and surface recombination issues. To solve this problem, we applied a dual strategy to simultaneously enhance charge separation and catalytic activity in MIL-125-NH2 and UIO-66-NH2 MOF photocatalysts. Mesoporous TiO2 was used as electron-selective contact on the MOF surface (MOF/TiO2) to minimize bulk recombination. On the other hand, to increase the MOF catalytic activity for water oxidation, a well-matched Co-3(PO4)(2) (CoPi) co-catalyst (CoPi/MOF/TiO2) was used. The obtained results showed that CoPi and TiO2 were introduced in the MOF structure. The (CoPi/MOF/TiO2) photoelectrodes showed a photocurrent density 26 times higher compared to the reference MOF at 1.23 V vs. RHE for PEC water oxidation of artificial seawater, validating the developed strategy for further photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical applications.

The reaction conditions for the novel synthetic method were optimized and the morphology and crystal structure of the prepared materials were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Condensation and polymerization of NaTa(OC3H7)(6) under atmospheric pressure gave a porous amorphous structure that could be converted to crystalline NaTaO3 while crystalline Na2Ta2O6 nanocrystals with a 25 nm average particle size could be obtained from a hydrothermal method using NH3 as a base catalyst. In addition, the photocatalytic behaviors of the prepared materials were investigated for overall water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen. Unexpectedly, porous amorphous sodium tantalum oxide showed much better catalytic activity over the crystalline one. The synthesized Na2Ta2O6 nanocrystals also indicated promising activity for overall water splitting without any co-catalyst in comparison to bulk NaTaO3. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Gold occurs mainly in pyrite- and polymetallic sulfide-quartz vein/veinlet stock-works. Fluid inclusions in the deposit are divided into three main types, namely CO2-H2O, H2O-CO2 +/- CH4 and aqueous ones. Microthermometric data show that the pre-gold fluids were CO2-dominant (X-CO2 up to 0.53), and the total homogenization temperatures fall in the range of 298 similar to 377 degrees C. These fluids, modified by fluid/wallrock reactions, gradually evolved into fluids with less CO2 (X-CO2=0.01 similar to 0.19) in the main ore-forming stage, and the total homogenization temperatures range from 170 to 324 degrees C. Hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope data suggest that ore-forming fluids were mixture of magmatic and meteoritic origin. Co-occurrence of gold and sulfides implies that gold was most likely transported in the form of gold-sulfide complexes. The wide distribution Of CO2 inclusions means that the pH variation during gold transportation was controlled by CO2 buffering. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The films are obtained from the chemical decomposition of the 1,1,3,3 TetraMethylDiSilOxane (TMDSO) monomer premixed with oxygen by reaction in the far remote afterglow of a nitrogen microwave discharge. The process control, i.e. the knowledge about the relation between film thickness and deposition duration can only be achieved through in situ diagnostics. In this aim, the optical intensity of a laser beam signal after reflection on the substrate is monitored during deposition. The relevance of the analysis method has been tested for thicknesses close to 17 micrometers. The reproducibility of the signal is discussed according to the film properties. A first determination of the surface roughness has been proposed after comparison with theoretical reflectance. The resulting temporal evolution of the signal is compared with the film's thickness determined by profiler measurements for different deposition durations. Linearity of the growth rate deduced from reflected signal with the effective one has been demonstrated.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1093-3611	1940-4360		WOS:000230103000012

The abundance ratios of the main isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen are modified by the CNO-cycle in the stellar interiors. When the di ff erent dredge-up events mix the burning material with the envelope, valuable information on the nucleosynthesis and mixing processes can be extracted by measuring these isotope ratios.Aims. Previous determinations of the oxygen isotopic ratios in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) carbon stars were at odds with the existing theoretical predictions. We aim to redetermine the oxygen ratios in these stars using new spectral analysis tools and further develop discussions on the carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios in order to elucidate this problem.Methods. Oxygen isotopic ratios were derived from spectra in the K-band in a sample of galactic AGB carbon stars of di ff erent spectral types and near solar metallicity. Synthetic spectra calculated in local thermodynamic equillibrium (LTE) with spherical carbon-rich atmosphere models and updated molecular line lists were used. The CNO isotope ratios derived in a homogeneous way, were compared with theoretical predictions for low-mass (1.5-3 M-circle dot) AGB stars computed with the FUNS code assuming extra mixing both during the RGB and AGB phases.Results. For most of the stars the O-16/O-17/O-18 ratios derived are in good agreement with theoretical predictions confirming that, for AGB stars, are established using the values reached after the first dredge-up (FDU) according to the initial stellar mass. This fact, as far as the oxygen isotopic ratios are concerned, leaves little space for the operation of any extra mixing mechanism during the AGB phase. Nevertheless, for a few stars with large O-16/O-17/O-18, the operation of such a mechanism might be required, although their observed C-12/C-13 and N-14/N-15 ratios would be di ffi cult to reconcile within this scenario. Furthermore, J-type stars tend to have lower O-16/O-17 ratios than the normal carbon stars, as already indicated in previous studies. Excluding these peculiar stars, AGB carbon stars occupy the same region as pre-solar type I oxide grains in a O-17/O-16 vs. O-18/O-16 diagram, showing little spread. This reinforces the idea that these grains were probably formed in low-mass stars during the previous O-rich phases.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000395821900119

In this work, the C/MoS 2 -CoMo 2 S 4 was successfully prepared by calcining the hybrid of ZIF-67 and C/MoS 2 at 800 degrees C. The composite materials have three advantages for oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR/OER) of LOBs, including highly efficient catalysis of CoMo 2 S 4 , abundant porous network and a surface conducive to Li 2 O 2 precipitation. The LOBs with acid-pickled C/MoS 2 -CoMo 2 S 4 -800 showed a high discharge specific capacity (17,551 mAh g -1 ) and an excellent cycle stability of 336 cycles at a current density of 500 mA g -1 and capacity limit of 1000 mAh g -1 . Interestingly, the catalytic activity of C/MoS 2 -CoMo 2 S 4 can be improved by acid pickling or the increasement of calcination temperature from 700 to 800 degrees C.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000806854600003

The schematic energy level diagram of YRO was drawn, and its band gap was found to locate in pi* antibonding orbital, dominated by Ru-4d electrons. RuO6 octahedrons in YRO undergo a compressing trigonal distortion, with a local symmetry group of D-3d, which is quite different from RuO2 and perovskite ruthenium oxide. When Y is substituted by divalent cation M (M-Y), O vacancies can achieve low formation energy and introduce the MY-VO and 2M(Y)-V-O complex. Further calculation showed that M-Y-V-O complex in YRO can induce an impurity energy level into forbidden band, and narrow the band gap. As a result, high electrical conductivity of Y1-xMxRu2O7-delta is expected, and M-Y-V-O complex may be the origin of electrocatalytic activity in Y1-xMxRu2O7.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0022-3697	1879-2553		WOS:000659804900019

The results show that AC interference and pH can collectively affect the corrosion behavior of the steel. The applied AC weakens the oxygen depolarization, enhances the hydrogen evolution reaction, and promotes the corrosion of the steel. The corrosion form of the steel evolves from non-uniform general corrosion to localized corrosion as i(AC) increases. Under the same interference of i(AC), the corrosion rate of the steel first decreases and then increases with increasing the pH value. The difference in the characteristics of corrosion products can affect the corrosion resistance of the steel to a certain extent. When AC is applied, a great number of cracks existing in the corrosion products of sample under the condition of pH=7 result in the severe corrosion. In contrast, the compactness corrosion product is conducive to protect the steel substrate tested at pH of 9.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1452-3981			WOS:000580810400066

The evolution of their microstructures, and dielectric properties were systematically studied. The co-doped ceramics exhibited a tetragonal rutile structure wherein the Nb and Tl elements were homogeneously distributed. The cell volumes, grain size, and permittivity increased with doping x, whereas the impedance values of the grain and grain boundary decreased with an increasing x. The optimum dielectric performance (epsilon(r) > 10(4), tan delta < 0.05) in the range of 10-10(6) Hz was obtained for x = 1.5 with a corresponding grain boundary active energy of 0.86 eV. Four types of dielectric relaxation were observed at different temperature ranges: 10-30 K, 30-200 K, 200-350 K and 350-475 K; those dielectric relaxtions were respectively caused by electron-pinned defect-dipoles, electron hopping, oxygen vacancy hopping, and Maxwell-Wagner polarization. The colossal permittivity is primarily a result of the electron-pinned defect-dipole polarization.									47	0	0	0	1	0	47			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000436351700028

Amorphous catalysts, especially the mixed metal oxides/hydroxides, show better stability and activity because of their unique morphology. Facile, reproducible synthesis of these catalysts by a simple method has been problematic. In this Letter, we show for the first time the application of pulse plating to synthesize amorphous Co-La mixed double hydroxide (MDH) on BiVO4/FTO (FTO, flourine-doped tin oxide). The method provides better adhesion and uniform deposits with controlled composition and grain size and facilitates fast charge transport, while lowering the charge recombination at the interface of the electrolyte and the semiconductor. With respect to BiVO4, reduction in onset potential by 0.53 V as well as 2.7 and 33.4 times increment in photocurrent density (J) at 1.23 V and the lower potential 0.6 V, respectively, obtained by BiVO4/MDH is noteworthy. The results obtained here suggest the possibility of using BiVO4/MDH in PEC cells and photoelectrochemical diodes.									44	3	0	0	1	1	44			2380-8195			WOS:000401500200017

Significant improvements in CO2 reduction activity beyond transition metals require the stabilization of key intermediates, COOH* and CHO* or COH*, independent of CO*. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that the doped sulfur edge of MoS2 satisfies this requirement by binding CO* significantly weaker than COOH*, CHO*, and COH*, relative to transition-metal surfaces. The structural basis for the scaling of doped sulfur edge of MoS2 is due to CO* binding on the metallic site (doping metal) and COOH*, CHO*, and COH* on the covalent site (sulfur). Linear scaling relations still exist if all the intermediates bind to the same site, but the combined effect of the two binding sites results in an overall deviation from transition-metal scaling lines. This principle can be applied to other metal/p-block materials. We rationalize the weak binding of CO* on the sulfur site with distortion/interaction and charge density difference analyses.									183	12	0	0	9	0	186			2155-5435			WOS:000379457300044

The PEC performances of GO-decorated TiO2 NR photoanodes were characterized by optical and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. In 1 M KOH, the photocurrent density of the TiO2 NR film decreased after deposition of GO, while in the neutral pH electrolyte (phosphate buffered 0.5 M Na2SO4), the TiO2 NR photoanode showed enhanced performance after deposition with the 2 wt% GO solution. This was a consequence of the decrease in charge transfer resistance between the electrode surface and the electrolyte. The improvement of photocurrents by GO decoration was obvious near the onset potential of the photocurrents in the neutral pH electrolyte. These opposite contributions of GO on the TiO2 NR photoanodes suggest that GO can promote water oxidation effectively in a neutral electrolyte because depending on the pH of the electrolyte, different chemical species interact with the surface of the photoanode in the water oxidation reaction.									33	1	0	0	1	0	33			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000351437500016	25711207

The dispersion-controlled dissipative scheme (DCD) is adopted to solve two-dimensional Euler equations im-plemented with detailed chemical reaction kinetics of hydrogen-oxygen-argon mixture. The fractional step method is applied to treat the stiff problem. For validation and verification, computational results are compared with experimental schlieren and nice agreement is obtained. The triple-point trajectories and the critical wedge angle acr are measured experimentally, analytically and numerically. From numerical results it is observed that the critical wedge angle acr for the transition from Mach reflection to regular reflection is very close to the experimental data. The numerical results also show that the angle ( x ) °f triple-point trajectory mainly depends on wedge angle ( a ) and is not sensitive to variation of the initial pressure Po. In addition, the detailed cellular structures are also simulated to demonstrate the evolution of multi-wave front structure of a detonation wave and the mechanism of the formation of triple-point when a detonation front reflects over a wedge.			本文应用基元反应模型和频散可控耗散格式(DCD)对氢氧爆轰波进行了二维数值模拟.氢氧混合物的化学反应模型考虑了8种组分20个反应方程式.在处理化学反应引起的刚性问题时采用了时间算子分裂的方法.本文首先对爆轰波数值结果和实验结果进行了对照验证,然后对爆轰波在楔面反射由马赫反射向规则反射转变的过程进行了数值分析,得到了反射转变临界角,并和实验结果及理论分析进行了比较,结果是令人满意的;本文还对爆轰波的多波结构进行了初步的数值分析.						0	1	0		0	0	1			0258-1825			CSCD:1993721

Fuel tank inerting is the process of reducing the flammability of the ullage by supplying it with an inert gas like nitrogen. Current inerting techniques are expensive, consume large amounts of energy, and fail prematurely. Here, we propose a novel in-flight electrochemical gas separation and inerting system (EGSIS) to produce and supply nitrogen-enriched air (NEA). EGSIS combines a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell cathode with a PEM electrolyzer anode to generate humidified NEA as the cathode output which can be dehumidified and supplied directly to the fuel tank. The required rate of NEA varies during a typical flight and a major advantage of EGSIS is that the rate of NEA generation can be conveniently controlled by varying the voltage applied to the system. Here, we report on the performance of a single-cell EGSIS apparatus and evaluate its suitability for aircraft fuel tank inerting.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000659061400005

Methanol, ethanol and isopropanol have been mediated to synthesize three kinds of Bi2MoO6 hierarchical microflowers. Highly oriented (311) plane growth of orthorhombic Bi2MoO6 hierarchical microflowers have been confirmed. Interstitial vacancies and its role on electrochemical activity have been extensively discussed. Electrode fabrication was constructively done by using Ni foam substrate. Half cell arrangement of each electrode in alkaline medium has been designed to measure the electrochemical activity towards water oxidation. High current density of 356 mA/cm(2) was afforded by Bi2MoO6 hierarchical microflowers mediated by ethanol solvent during synthesis. Low Tafel slope value of 43 mV/dec has been reported to obtain 10 mA/cm(2) current density. Higher conductivity long with very good electron transportation has been achieved and is also adapted for 12 h long time stability test and achieved 86% of retention in its performance. Hence, optimally prepared Bi2MoO6 hierarchical microflowers could be an efficient electrode for clean energy fabrication. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, the in situ investigation is still a great challenge in practice, because TMD CVD growth is conducted at a high temperature with a reduction environment. In this work, we developed an in situ investigation system for CVD growth and presented real-time observations of monolayer MoS2 deposition on the SiO2/Si substrate. We discovered that monolayer MoS2 should be grown via the vapor-state precursor reaction and crystallized from the prenucleation sites on a substrate, an intermediate-phase MoO2 was essential for the nucleation seeding, but the population density should be controlled, and a high-concentration S vapor promoted the in-plane epitaxial growth of MoS2; hence, it was of great benefit to obtain a high-quality monolayer with a compact shape.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2637-6113			WOS:000557756300015

The prepared NPs were alloyed with the face-centered cubic (fcc) structure. In addition, the particle sizes, composition, and shape are strongly correlated but can be tailored by an appropriate variation of the sputtering parameters. No individual particle but large agglomerates with partial alloy structure formed at Pt content of less than 16 atom %. Highly dispersed NPs with no agglomeration were observed in PEG when the quantity of Pt is more than 26 atom %. On the other hand, a small amount of Pt could terminate the agglomeration of Au when sputtering on the grids for transmission electron microscope observation. Our experiment and computer simulation carried out by two different methods indicate that the composition-dependent particle size of Pt/Au can be explained by the atomic concentration, formation energy of the cluster, and interaction between different metal atoms and the PEG molecule.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0743-7463			WOS:000526391100002	32150418

In 0.1 mol/L Na_2SO_4 solution, the reaction potential of electrochemical oxidation of phenol on Pt electrode is +0.9-1.0 V(vs SCE), and the oxygen evolution potential is +1.3 V. In situ infrared spectroscopy showed that electrode potential had a great influence on oxidation behavior of phenol. When the potential was lower than 0.9 V, the main intermediates of phenol oxidation were dihydroxyhenzene, quinone and a few alcohols. When the potential was controlled between 0.9 V and 1.1 V, the structure of benzene ring was destroyed, and the main intermediates were ketones, acids, alcohols and CO_2. According to the changes in absorption peak of functional group, phenol oxidation on the platinum electrode surface was as follows: phenol, dihydroxyhenzene, quinone, ketone, alcohol, acid and CO_2. The potential of ammonia oxidation on the platinum electrode surface was + 0.5 V, which indicated that ammonia in competition with phenol oxidation in the low potential region(< 0.9 V).			采用电化学原位红外光谱技术,研究了苯酚在Pt电极表面的电化学氧化机理。在0.1 mol/L Na_2SO_4溶液中,Pt电极上电化学氧化苯酚的反应电位为+0.9~1.0 V(vs SCE)、析氧电位为+1.3 V;电化学原位红外光谱结果表明,当电位<0.9 V时,苯酚氧化产物主要为苯二酚、醌及少量醇类物质;电位0.9~1.1 V时,苯环结构被破坏,氧化产物主要为酮、酸、醇和CO_2;根据官能团吸收峰的变化,苯酚在Pt电极表面氧化经历如下途径:苯酚苯二酚苯醌酮、醇、酸CO_2。同时研究了NH_4~+对苯酚在Pt电极表面的电氧化的影响,结果表明在低电位区(<0.9 V)对苯酚氧化构成竞争。						0	2	0	0	0	0	2			0438-1157			CSCD:6631788

Due to the different physicochemical properties of graphene with various N species loading, the efficiency of catalysts was novelty discussed. The morphology, N-doped content/species, and the graphene defects of the catalyst were analyzed by TEM, FTIR, XPS, EA, and Raman spectroscopy. The results show that the doping morphology of the N atoms gradually shifted from pyridinic N and pyrrolic N to graphitic N with increased hydrothermal time, in order to decrease the defect degrees and redox activity. However, the conductivity of material increased with the graphitic N generation. The best APAP degradation efficiency (100% with 20 mA, 1 g/L NaCl, and initial pH 3.0) can be achieved with 1.5-N-GN/Pt/TiO2 (mainly pyridinic N and pyrrolic N doping). A detailed investigation was conducted to determine the oxidation intermediates of APAP using GC-MS analysis. Finally, a possible degradation pathway was proposed.[GRAPHICS].									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000439734700019

Alkaline water electrolysis is a well matured technique and proved to be suitable for large-scale applications. Materials development for alkaline water electrolyzers is still of interest for academia and industry to address the issues of low compatibility to renewable power sources. A lab-scale system for alkaline water electrolysis was developed, aiming to advance materials development and to bridge the intrinsic properties of materials with their performance under realistic operating conditions. As the smallest pressure-type electrolyzer, it is capable of working at 30 bar and 80 degrees C with continuous liquid electrolyte circulation. Experimental studies investigate the influence of temperature, pressure, and intrinsic properties of materials on voltage efficiency and hydrogen purity. With appropriate analysis, links between material specifications and overall performance can be established, encouraging new designs and material innovations for alkaline water electrolysis.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			2168-0485			WOS:000429285800044

The experimental data suggest that the formation of oligomeric structures is related in part to the formation of insoluble tholins in the presence of oxygen-containing molecules. Although oligomerization proceeds well in water, product isolation turned out to be impractical. Instead, solid precipitates were obtained easily in acetone. Crude mixtures have been thoroughly scrutinized by spectroscopic methods, in particular NMR and mass spectroscopy (ESI mode), which are all consistent with the generation of a few functional groups that are embedded into regular chains of five- and six-membered rings, thereby pointing to a supramolecular organization. Three different models of cross-condensation and chain growth are suggested. These synthetic explorations provide further insights into the formation of complex organic matter in interstellar scenarios and extraterrestrial bodies that might have played a pivotal role in chemical evolution.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000383755200030	27455123

On a global scale, the intensive use of this energy source has resulted in highly detrimental effects to the environment. Hydrogen production by water splitting, with sunlight as the main energy source, is a promising way to augment the production of renewable energy; however, the development of an efficient and stable water-oxidizing catalyst remains a key task before a technological breakthrough based on water splitting can be realized. A main issue hampering the development of commercially viable, non-precious-metal-based catalysts is their susceptibility to degradation. To efficiently address this major drawback, self-healing catalysts that can repair their structure without human intervention will be necessary. In this review, we focus on water oxidation by natural and artificial Mn-, Co-, and Ni-based catalysts and then discuss the self-healing properties that contribute to sustaining their catalytic activity.									47	1	0	0	7	0	47			2155-5435			WOS:000350843500012

Pyrolysis reactions were carried out in a fixed bed reactor by varying the pressure up to 2.0 MPa. Two coal samples with a substantial difference in the swelling index were used for the analysis. Pyrolysis experiments were carried out at 800 degrees C for 30 min after heating the sample at a constant rate of 20 degrees C/min and some samples were pyrolyzed at 900 degrees C and 0.1 MPa for comparison. Structural analysis of the coal chars was performed using Raman microscopy; this characterization was complemented by scanning electron microscopy analysis, gas adsorption and reactivity towards molecular oxygen in a thermogravimetric equipment. Characteristic Raman bands of coal chars exhibited significant changes from 0.1 to 0.5 MPa, after this pressure no significant changes were observed with pressure increments. The pyrolysis pressure showed to have an influence in the ordering of the carbonaceous structures through the deconvoluted Raman spectra. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Siegbahn, PEM								Theoretical models for the oxygen radical mechanism of water oxidation and of the water oxidizing complex of photosystem II								INORGANIC CHEMISTRY				39	13			2923	2935		10.1021/ic9911872				JUN 26 2000	2000	Hybrid density functional theory is used to study reasonably realistic models of the oxygen-evolving manganese complex in photosystem II. Since there is not yet any X-ray structure of the complex, other types of experimental and theoretical information are used to construct the model complexes. In these complexes, three manganese centers are predicted to be closely coupled hy mu-oxo bonds in a triangular orientation. Using these models, the previously suggested oxygen radical mechanism for O-2 formation is reinvestigated. It is found that the oxygen radical in the Sg State now appears in a bridging position between two manganese atoms. It is still suggested that only one manganese atom is redox-active, Instead, a number of surprisingly large trans-effects are found, which motivate the existence and define the function of the other manganese atoms in the Mn-4 cluster. Calcium has a strong chelating effect which helps in the creation of the necessary oxygen radical. In the present model the chemistry preceding the actual O-O bond formation occurs in an incomplete cube with a missing corner and with two manganese and one calcium in three of the corners. The external water providing the second oxygen of O-2 enters in the missing corner of the cube. The present findings are in most cases in good agreement with experimental results as given in particular by EXAFS.									149	0	1	0	53	0	149			0020-1669			WOS:000087905000034	11232834	
J	ROSENQVIST, J; CHASSEFIERE, E								A REEXAMINATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EDDY MIXING AND O-2 IN THE MARTIAN MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS				100	E3			5541	5551		10.1029/95JE00324				MAR 25 1995	1995	A value of the eddy diffusion coefficient K of approximate to 1.5x10(6) cm(2) s(-1) in the middle atmosphere of Mars was obtained from Phobos 2 solar occultation measurements of dust, ozone, and clouds at low latitude. The aim of the present study is to complete this picture by using a steady state photochemical one-dimensional model. The main regulation mechanism of O-2 is the reaction of O with itself, whose rate depends on the value of K in the middle atmosphere. By comparing calculated and observed values of the O-2 abundance, an upper limit of approximate to 2x10(7) cm(-2) s(-1) on K is inferred. By including an additional constraint provided by H-2 balance, a lower limit of approximate to 4x10(6) cm(-2) s(-1) may be placed. It results from the present analysis that the most realistic value of K to be used in works resorting to one-dimensional modeling (long-term evolution, escape, surface/atmosphere exchanges) is approximate to 10(7) cm(2) s(-1) rather than approximate to 10(6) cm(2) s(-1). The difference between theoretical and observational values might be due to the regular occurrence of global dust storms, whose effect should be to increase the yearly average value of K. The present study suggests less than 3 precipitable micrometer (pr-mu m) of the yearly averaged water vapor column, unless H2O is confined in a layer near the ground. Although the first possibility seems more probable, the second hypothesis cannot be ruled out. It could reflect a continuous supply of H2O from the regolith to the atmosphere on a seasonal scale. The loss to production ratio of CO, which has a lifetime of approximate to 5 years, is shown to depart from unity by no more than approximate to 10% over a wide range of atmospheric conditions. The stability of the Martian atmosphere is therefore realized in the classical frame of homogeneous chemistry.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2169-9097	2169-9100		WOS:A1995QN87700024

In the relevant temperature range for these environments (T = 0.05-0.5 GK), the main contributions to this reaction rate are from the direct capture process as well as the high-energy tail of a subthreshold resonance in the ground-state transition at E-x = 2425 keV in the Na-21 compound nucleus.Purpose: The previous measurement of this reaction reports cross sections with large uncertainties for the ground-state transition. At higher energies, where the subthreshold resonance makes a smaller contribution to the total cross section, only upper limits are provided. This work aims to reduce the uncertainty in the cross section where direct capture dominates, as well as provide cross-section data in previously unmeasured regions.Method: The Ne-20(p, gamma)Na-21 reaction was measured over a wide proton energy range (E-p = 0.5-2.0 MeV) at theta(lab) = 90 degrees. Transitions to the ground state and to the 332 and 2425 keV excited states were observed. The primary transitions to these three bound states were utilized in an R-matrix analysis to determine the contributions of the direct capture and the subthreshold resonance to the total cross section.Results: The cross sections of the present measurements have been found to be in good agreement with the previous data at low energy. Significantly improved cross-section measurements have been obtained over the E-p = 1300-1900 keV region. The narrow resonance at E-c.m. = 1113 keV(E-x = 3544.3 keV) has also been remeasured and its strength has been found to be in good agreement with previous measurements.Conclusions: An extrapolation of the S factor of Ne-20(p, gamma)Na-21 has been made to lowenergies using the R-matrix fit. The reaction rate from the subthreshold resonance was found to be the main contributor to the reaction rate at temperatures below about 0.1 GK. The present rate is lower in the temperature range of interest than those presented in current reaction rate libraries by up to 20%.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2469-9985	2469-9993		WOS:000434211000001		
J	Jiang, Guo-Jie; Wang, Yi; Yu, Zhi-Xiang								DFT Study on the Mechanism and Stereochemistry of the Petasis-Ferrier Rearrangements								JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY				78	14			6947	6955		10.1021/jo400699a				JUL 19 2013	2013	The Petasis-Ferrier rearrangement is a very important and useful reaction for the synthesis of multifunctional tetrahydrofurans and tetrahydropyrans from easily synthesized enol acetals. Here we report our DFT investigation of the detailed reaction mechanism of the Petasis-Ferrier rearrangement, proposing that the active promoting species in this reaction is the cationic aluminum species, instead of the usually considered neutral Lewis acid (this will give very high activation energies and cannot explain why the Petasis-Ferrier rearrangements usually take place at low temperature or under mild conditions). Calculations indicated that the mechanisms of the Petasis-Ferrier rearrangements for the formations of five- and six-membered rings are different. Formation of five-membered tetrahydrofuranone is stepwise with C-O bond cleavage to generate an oxocarbenium enolate intermediate, which then undergoes an aldol-type reaction to give the desired cyclized oxacycle. In contrast, the formation of six-membered tetrahydropyranone is a concerted and asynchronous process with the C-O bond breakage and aldol-type C-C bond formation occurring simultaneously. A DFT understanding of why the catalytic versions of the Petasis-Ferrier rearrangements cannot be realized when using R2Al+ as the active promoting species has also been discussed. In addition, DFT calculations were used to reveal the origins of the stereochemistry observed in the Petasis-Ferrier rearrangements.									20	1	0	0	4	0	21			0022-3263			WOS:000322210700010	23768096

In particular, different polymorphs of VO2 microstructures, that is, VO2(A), VO2(B), VO2(M), and so on, obtained by the influence of beta-MnO2 have been paid much attention because of their wide range of potential applications, especially, in electrochemical water splitting. Accordingly, the electrochemical activity of the VO2/2D-rGO composite for the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER and HER) was dramatically amended by tuning the electronic structure of VO2(A) using a cationic additive such as beta-MnO2. Moreover, the obtained VO2(A)/2D-rGO (MVAG) composite was used as a precursor for attaining different polymorph-based composite materials by altering the additive KMnO4. The crystallographic phase transition of the VO2(x) microstructure was systematically studied and confirmed by powder X-ray diffractometer patterns. By varying the additive concentration, three different composite materials were prepared: beta-MnO2-VO2(M)/2D-rGO (MVMG), beta-MnO2-VO2(B)/2D-rGO (MVBG), and beta-MnO2-V2O5/2D-rGO (MVOG). Benefiting from the prismatic type of the VO2(B) microstructure, the MVBG composite material shows enhanced OER (273 mV) and HER (178 mV) activities to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Remarkably, the two-electrode system has been constructed using one of the polymorphs such as MVBG parallel to MVBG to study the cell voltage of 1.62 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and displayed a Tafel slope of 108 mV dec(-1). In addition, the MVBG parallel to MVBG system showed outstanding long-term stability for 35 h. This work offers simple and convenient protocols for achieving cost-effective bifunctional composite materials for overall water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000766230000013

Taking 2D Bi2WO6 as a model, we found that the configuration of bilayer Bi(2)O(2 )sandwiched by alternating WO4 layers enabled the thermodynamic driving potential for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Without Pt deposition, the H-2 generation efficiency can reach to 56.9 mu mol/g/h by 2D Bi2WO6 as compared with no activity of Bi2WO6 nanocrystals under simulated solar light. This configuration is easily functionalized by adsorption of Cl-/Br- to form Bi-Cl/Bi-Br bonds, which leads to the decrease of recombination in photogenerated charge carriers and narrower band gaps. This work highlights an effective way to design photocatalysts with efficient hydrogen evolution by tuning the surface terminations.									32	3	0	0	2	0	33			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000529924800085	32233392

However, as H-2 and O-2 are produced in close proximity to each other in water electrolyzers, mixing of the gases can occur during electrolysis, with potentially dangerous consequences. Herein, we describe an electrochemical water-splitting cell, in which mixing of the electrogenerated gases is impossible. In our cell, separate H-2- and O-2-evolving cells are connected electrically by a bipolar electrode in contact with an inexpensive dissolved redox couple (K3Fe(CN)(6)/K4Fe(CN)(6)). Electrolytic water splitting occurs in tandem with oxidation/reduction of the K3Fe(CN)(6)/K4Fe(CN) redox couples in the separate compartments, affording completely spatially separated H-2 and O-2 evolution. We demonstrate operation of our prototype cell using conventional Pt electrodes for each gas-evolving reaction, as well as using earth-abundant Ni2P electrocatalysts for H-2 evolution. Furthermore, we show that our cell can be run in reverse and operate as a H-2 fuel cell, releasing the energy stored in the electrogenerated H-2 and O-2. We also describe how the absence of an ionically conducting electrolyte bridging the H-2- and O-2-electrode compartments makes it possible to develop H-2 fuel cells in which the anode and cathode are at different pH values, thereby increasing the voltage above that of conventional fuel cells. The use of our cell design in electrolyzers could result in dramatically improved safety during operation and the generation of higher-purity H-2 than available from conventional electrolysis systems. Our cell could also be readily modified for the electrosynthesis of other chemicals, where mixing of the electrochemical products is undesirable.									31	0	0	0	2	0	31			1944-8244			WOS:000406172700039	28654236

Comparative studies were performed on intact PSII membranes and PSII membranes that were deprived of the 1 8-kDa peripheral subunit (0.25 NaCl washed), the 18- and 24-kDa peripheral subunits (I M NaCl washed), the 18-, 24- and 33-kDa peripheral subunits (1.2 M CaCl2 washed), Cl depleted and after complete depletion of the Mn cluster (Tris washed). In active PSII centers, about 75% of Cyt b559 was found in the high-potential form and the rest in the intermediate potential form. With decomposition of the donor side, the intermediate potential form started to dominate, reaching more than 90% after Tris treatment. The oxygen-dependent conversion of the intermediate potential form of Cyt b559 into the low-potential and high-potential forms was only observed after treatments that directly affect the Mn cluster. In PSII membranes, deprived of all three extrinsic subunits (CaCl2 treatment), 21 % of the intermediate potential form was converted into the low-potential form and 14% into the high-potential form by the removal of oxygen. In Tris-washed PSII membranes, completely lacking the Mn cluster, this conversion amounted to 60 and 33%, respectively. In intact PSII membranes, the oxygen-dependent conversion did not occur. The possible physiological role of this oxygen-dependent behavior of the Cyt b(559) redox forms during the assembly/photoactivation cycle of PSII is discussed.									15	0	1	0	14	0	16			0031-9317	1399-3054		WOS:000249100800005	18251923

Hybrid PEC systems containing semiconductor photosensitizers and molecular catalysts are reported to be highly active and stable for water splitting with great potential for facilitating clean fuels production. In this review, following a showcasing of the fundamental details of hybrid PEC systems for water splitting, semiconductor/molecular catalyst interface designs are highlighted, with a focus on interfacial physicochemical interactions and binding, and interfacial energetics and dynamics for efficient charge transfer. Recent advances in hybrid system assemblies for PEC water splitting are also briefly introduced.

It is crucial but still challengeable to circumvent these drawbacks. Herein, we facilely synthesize a novel kind of composite nanocatalyst system to conquer these issues of palladium (Pd) NPs. To be specific, nanochannels of dendritic mesoporous silica&titania nanospheres (DMSTNs) could confine Pd NPs. Anatase titania (TiO2) and the coupled mercapto groups (-SH) on the surface could remarkably disperse and robustly anchor Pd. The as-prepared DMSTNs-SH-Pd displays outstanding performance in p-nitrophenol reduction, where a synergistic effect of the chemical composition and surface functionality on the catalytic activity can be further confirmed by photocatalytic water splitting and Suzuki coupling reaction. The strategy for Pd NPs spatially confined in nanochannels and finely decorated on chemically functionalized supports might be versatile for other noble metals like gold (Au), platinum (Pt), etc.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000768616400013

The charge separation efficiency of the Ktdoped ZnO/g-C3N4 heterojunction was 17.6 and 2.9 times those of g-C3N4 and KZO. As expected, the K ion-doped ZnO/g-C3N4 heterojunction possessed better photocatalytic isopropanol degradation performance. The highest acetone evolution rate of IC-doped ZnO/g-C3N4 heterojunction was 28.5 ppm.min(-1), which was 2.7 times better than that of g-C3N4 and 1.7 times better than that of KZO. The improvement of charge separation efficiency and photocatalytic performance of K+-doped ZnO/g-C3N4 heterojunction is mainly due to the following two points. K+-doped ZnO/g-C3N4 heterojunction with a staggered band structure could effectively improve the carrier separation. The high surface area and mesoporous structure could realize the high efficiency of mass transfer and rapid surface reaction of reactants. These K+-doped ZnO/g-C3N4 heterojunctions with high photocatalytic activities could be widely used in air purification.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0888-5885			WOS:000736851100001

Herein, a hierarchical erythroid-like BiVO4/hm-C4N3 direct Z-Scheme heterojunction is developed through elaborate template inducement and in-situ polymerization. The superior CO2 capture, activation and charge deliver features are all integrated in reduction site of the Z-Scheme system. The overall photocatalytic CO2 and H2O conversion to CO and O2 are achieved without any sacrificial reagent and co-catalyst. In particular, the optimized BiVO4/hm-C4N3 presents a CO production rate of 40.8 mu mol g-1 h-1 with a selectivity beyond 97 %. DFT calculation and in-situ DRIFTS spectra indicate that the dehydration of *COOH to CO is the rate-determining step. The supplement of proton by H2O oxidation from BiVO4 and the prolonged lifetime of electrons simultaneously contribute to the remarkable decreased reaction barrier. This work provides a new strategy to develop organic half-metal based photocatalyst, and may pave a new way to the target of artificial photosynthesis.									22	0	0	0	4	0	22			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000663306300002

This study aimed to clarify the correlations among Hg-0 adsorption, CO decomposition, and Fe2O3 reduction degree. Theoretical results indicated that Hg(0)underwent Fe top site adsorption to Fe bridge site adsorption as Fe2O3 was reduced into iron. This phenomenon increased E-ads with a local extreme of -2.063 eV for Hg-0-Fe2O1.364. The adsorption of Hg(0)decreased E-ads for CO adsorption on the reduced Fe2O3 surfaces but promoted charge transfer from the surface to the adsorbed CO molecule. This event activated the C O bond, favoring its decomposition. A kinetic model for catalytic CO decompositions with and without Hg further revealed the synergistic effect of Hg on carbon deposition and the relationship between the reaction rate and degree of chemical looping combustion.									8	3	0	0	1	0	10			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000374804400094

The chlorate cell involves the electrochemical evolution of a gas that impinges a large velocity on the electrolyte flowing between two participating electrodes that are only 3 mm apart. The model is written to take into account the diffusion, migration and convection transport mechanisms, of the electrolyte species, and assumes that the hydrodynamic flow is the laminar development of fluid between two parallel plates. The transport, of each of the species, and kinetic data, for all the chemical and electrochemical reactions and bireactions, are also involved in the model. Properties of the species are worked out with consideration to the high concentration and temperature of an electrolyte. The most important result from the model is the development of a diffusion layer of species along the height of the anode. This diffusion layer creates a substantial concentration overpotential, for chloride oxidation, especially at the top of the anode surface. This gives a non-uniform current density distribution on the anode that worsens as flow velocity decreases. Moreover, the model shows that the major bireaction is the production of oxygen from the electrochemical decay of hypochlorite and not from water splitting.

Unfortunately, the exploration of MoNi-based electrocatalysts with superior intrinsic activity and ultralong-term stability still remains a grand challenge. Here, ultralong high-index faceted Mo@MoNi core-shell nanowires were topochemically synthesized through the thermal reduction of MogNiMoO(4) core-shell nanowires, where single-crystalline Mo support facilitates the topological transformation of NiMoO4 into high-index faceted MoNi. When the as-achieved Mo@MoNi core-shell nanowire film serve as a free-standing cathode in alkaline solutions, it exhibit a remarkably decreased HER overpotential of 18 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of similar to 33 mV dec(-1), which are much lower than those for the state-of-the-art earth-abundant electrocatalysts and even commercial Pt/C. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the exposed high-index (331) facets of MoNi can considerably reduce the energy barriers of initial water dissociation and subsequent hydrogen combination steps, which synergistically accelerates the sluggish alkaline HER kinetics. Significantly, after a 70-day HER operation, the overpotential of Mo@MoNi electrocatalysts at 10 mA cm(-2) decreases by only 4 mV. Therefore, this work sheds a bright light on the rational design of high-performance HER electrocatalysts and their practical utilization for alkaline electrolyzers.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000562182900048	32667180

The electrochemical potential drives oxygen through the YSZ electrolyte towards a nominally 175 nm thin Pt film, which we found to locally delaminate from the substrate by forming nano-scale blisters. High resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) mapping of focused -ion beam (FIB)-prepared cross-sections of single bubbles of a few micrometers in diameter reveal them to be hollow and enclosed by a Pt outer and a few tens of nanometers thick PtOx inner shell. The oxide shell presumably formed due to the increase of local oxygen chemical activity under the applied process conditions (723 K, 500 mbar O-2, bias voltage +100 mV). Interface X-ray diffraction indicates that the solid electrolyte surface morphology is largely unaffected by the process suggesting that the YSZ surface is stable on the atomic scale under application relevant oxygen transport conditions. Platinum is known to be rather stable towards oxidation, even at elevated oxygen pressure, leading to oxide-scale thicknesses of the order of 1 nm. Our results however indicate that many of the kinetic barriers for oxidation during the nano-confined blistering process are lowered. This may have implications in general for the mechanism how oxygen is stored in an electrode at such an internal metal - oxide/metal - gas interface, which is important for the functionality of many solid-state electrochemical and memresistive devices.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0167-2738	1872-7689		WOS:000457511000003

In SrTiO3, these one-electron intermediates are radicals located in Ti-O (oxyl) and Ti-O-Ti (bridge) groups arranged perpendicular and parallel to the surface respectively, and form electronic states in the band gap of SrTiO3. Using an ultrafast sub band gap probe of 400 nm and white light, we excited transitions between these radical states and the conduction band. By measuring the time evolution of surface reflectivity following the pump pulse of 266 nm light, we determined an initial radical formation time of 1.3 +/- 0.2 ps, which is identical to the time to populate the surface with titanium oxyl (Ti-O) radicals. The oxyl was separately observed by a subsurface vibration near 800 cm(-1) from Ti-O located in the plane right below Ti-O. Second, a polarized transition optical dipole allows us to assign the 1.3 ps time constant to the production of both O-site radicals. After a 4.5 ps delay, another distinct surface species forms with a time constant of 36 +/- 10 ps with a yet undetermined structure. As would be expected, the radicals decay, specifically probed by the oxyls subsurface vibration, parallels that of the photocurrent. Our results led us to propose a nonadiabatic kinetic mechanism for generating radicals of the type Ti-O and Ti-O-Ti from valence band holes based on their solvation at aqueous interfaces.									56	2	0	0	2	0	56			0002-7863			WOS:000393848400031	27997159

We report results from studies of the in vitro reconstitution of spinach photosytem II with recombinant manganese stabilizing protein with C-terminal deletions of two, three, and four amino acids. The deletions were the result of amber mutations introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. Removal of the C-terminal dipeptide (Glu-Gln) did not diminish the ability of the manganese stabilizing protein either to rebind to or to restore high rates of Oz evolution to photosystem II preparations depleted of the native protein. Deletion of the C-terminal tripeptide (Leu-Glu-Gln) resulted in weakened but specific binding of manganese stabilizing protein to photosystem II and minimal recovery of O-2 evolution activity. Removal of the C-terminal tetrapeptide (Gln-Leu-Glu-Gln) eliminated the ability of the subunit to interact stably with all of its available binding sites on photosystem II, as evidenced by the fact that this mutant was totally inactive in restoring O-2 evolution activity. Evidence is presented to indicate that these mutational effects on the binding and function of the manganese stabilizing protein may be due to major changes in tertiary structure. The truncation mutations lacking either the C-terminal tri- or tetrapeptide exhibit apparent size increases of 25 and 40%, respectively, when compared either to a mutant lacking the C-terminal dipeptide or to the wild-type protein.									35	0	2	0	34	0	37			0006-2960			WOS:000076383900037	9760261	
J	Xu, Hang; Guo, Shaohua; Zhou, Haoshen								Review on anionic redox in sodium-ion batteries								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				7	41			23662	23678		10.1039/c9ta06389g				NOV 7 2019	2019	Rechargeable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have attracted a surge of interest as one of the most promising candidates for large-scale energy storage owing to their abundant natural resources and relatively high economic efficiency. However, the energy density provided by redox from transition metal ions has already been substantially studied and is approaching its limits. It is promising to break through the dilemma from a new aspect. Recently, the transformational anionic redox that has been widely investigated in lithium-rich layered cathodes has also been applied in SIBs; it has turned out to be an effective way to achieve worthwhile specific capacity and peculiar structural evolution. It is noteworthy that the anionic redox reaction can occur in both Na-deficient and Na-rich materials, which is different from that in lithium-ion batteries. This suggests that new electrochemistry could emerge in Na-based materials, providing opportunities to discover advanced materials and new chemistries. In this review, a systematic overlook of the published research on anionic redox in SIBs is provided, along with a discussion on the related theories that explain the mechanism of activating and stabilizing the anionic redox activity. Furthermore, current challenges and possible approaches for improvements are outlined. Further, we have summarized a variety of characterization techniques for investigating the anionic redox process. It is hoped that this review could further the understanding of the anionic redox activity in SIBs and provide an impetus to the development of advanced electrode materials for fabricating high-capacity SIBs that utilize the anionic redox reaction.									46	5	0	0	1	0	46			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000508175800017

The modified catalyst electrode exhibits both superior HER and OER performances with high activity, favorable kinetics, and outstanding durability. The overall ability toward water splitting is especially extraordinary, requiring a small overpotential of 333.5 mV to gain a 10 mA cm(-2) current density. A study on the electrocatalytic mechanism reveals that the atomic modulation between cation and anion plays an important role in optimizing the electrocatalytic activity, which greatly expands the active sites in the electrocatalyst. Further, the three-dimensional conductive porous network is highly advantageous for the exposure of active species, the transport of bubble products, and the transfer of electrons and charges, which substantially boosts reaction kinetics and structure stability.									308	15	0	0	13	0	309			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000384399300068	27622580

By manipulating the composition ratio of halogen elements (I/(Cl + Br)), the band gaps of these Bi-based solid solutions can be continuously modulated in a rather wide range of 2.88 to 1.82 eV. The density functional calculations demonstrate that this continuous band gap narrowing originates from the gradual increase of valence band maximum with increasing ratio of I/(Cl + Br). The photocatalytic evaluations showed these materials possess composition-dependent photoactivities for degrading 2-propanol (IPA) to acetone and CO2 under visible light (400 < lambda < 800 nm). Particularly, the highest acetone evolution rate (215.6 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) was achieved over BiO(ClBr)(0.21)I-0.58, which was 16.5, 11.8 and 659.3 times that of BiO(ClBr)(0.5), BiOI and commercial Bi2O3, respectively. And BiO(ClBr)(0.375)I-0.25 exhibited the best photocatalytic performance for CO2 evolution (4.8 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), 2.3 and 23.2 times that of BiO(ClBr)(0.5) and BiOI, respectively). In addition, a composition-dependent photocatalysis mechanism is proposed in detail and it involves the indirect hole-induced (OH)-O-center dot oxidation or direct hole oxidation of IPA molecules in valence bands and simultaneous electron reduction of oxygen to H2O2 in conduction bands. This work not only shows that BiO(ClBr)((1-x)/2)I-x photocatalysts hold great promise for practical applications but also proves that fabricating solid solutions is an effective approach to develop highly efficient visible-light photocatalysts.									93	2	0	0	18	0	94			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000352441100056

Only recently has it become evident that hemocyanins are present in Scutigeromorpha (Chilopoda) and Spirostreptida (Diplopoda). Here we present evidence for a more widespread occurrence of hemocyanin in the myriapods. By means of RT-PCR, western blotting and database searches, hemocyanins were identified in the symphylans Hanseniellaaudax and Symphylellavulgaris, the chilopod Scolopendrasubspinipesdehaani and the diplopod Polydesmusangustus. No hemocyanins were found in the diplopods Polyxenuslagurus, Cylindroiuluspunctatus, Glomerismarginata, Glomerispustulata and Arthrosphaerabrandtii, or the chilopods Lithobiusforficatus, Geophilusflavus and Strigamiamaritima. This suggests multiple independent losses in myriapod taxa. Two independent hemocyanin subunits were found that were already present in the myriapod stem line. We specifically investigated the structure of the hemocyanin of P.angustus, which consists of three distinct subunits that occur in an approximately equimolar ratio. As deduced by 3D electron microscopy, the quaternary structure is a 3x6-mer that resembles the half structure of the 6x6-mer hemocyanin from Scutigera coleoptrata. It was analyzed more closely by homology modeling of 1x6-mers and their rigid-body fitting to the electron density map of the 3x6-mer. In addition, we obtained the cDNA sequence of a putative myriapod phenoloxidase. Phenoloxidases are related to the arthropod hemocyanins, but diverged before radiation of the arthropod subphyla.									7	2	0	0	8	0	10			1742-464X	1742-4658		WOS:000333676000009	24520955

Unfortunately, examples of Pb-basedcatalysts for such a process are rare. In this work, based on the dual-linker strategy, we have designed and synthesized two new two-dimensional (2D) coordination polymers of Pb with thehcbtopology,[Pb2(tpbn)(adc)2]middot4H2Omiddot0.5CH3OH}n(CP1)and{[Pb2(tpbn)-(fum)2]middot7H2O}n(CP2), in excellent yields by the room-temperatureself-assembly of Pb(OAc)2, tpbn, and H2adc or H2fum (where tpbn =N,N ',N ''',N ''''-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl)-1,4-diaminobutane, H2adc =acetylene dicarboxylic acid, and H2fum = fumaric acid). In addition todetermining their X-ray single crystal structures, the phase purity andthermal stability were established by powder X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis, respectively. Furthermore, these werealso characterized by the microscopic techniques (SEM/EDX and TEM/HRTEM). For their conductive and highly stable nature inalkaline medium, bothCP1andCP2were tested for their suitability in the OER process. Interestingly, with a subtle change fromadc inCP1to fumarate inCP2as the dicarboxylate linker, the latter performed much better than the former and displayed anexcellent electrochemical stability in basic medium. Remarkably,CP2has one of the lowest Tafel values (35 mV dec-1) and a lowoverpotential value (140 mV vs RHE) in 0.5 M KOH compared to those reported for any materials.

In this paper, we synthesis a unique structured catalyst that was composed by Co9S8 nanowires and nickel cobalt layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) nanosheets. The ultrathin nanosheets decorated on the Co9S8 nanoarrays offer large specific surface area, numerous active edge sites and excellent electrical conductivity for fast electron transfer. Benefiting from this heterogeneous structure, the catalyst presents excellent catalytic performance in alkaline media. It requires 168 mV to reach current density of 10 mA/cm(2) for HER and 278 mV to reach current density of 30 mA/cm(2) for OER. When used as electrode in a homemade two-electrode system, it only needs t a voltage of 1.63 V to achieve current densities of 10 mA/cm(2), which proves Co9S8@NiCo LDH/NF as a superior bifunctional catalyst for water splitting.

The key results were obtained through single photoionization reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PI-ReTOF-MS) and exploiting isotopically labeled samples ((CO2)-O-18-CH4; CO2-CD4). Not only acetic acid (CH3COOH), along with fragments of acetic acid dimers (CH3COOH)(2), but also the hitherto elusive interstellar methyl hydroperoxide (CH3COOH) and the hydrocarbons ethane (C2H6) and butane (C4H10), along with species belonging to C2H4O, C2H6O, and C3H6O2 isomers, are swiftly formed via suprathermal reactions at doses of only 0.88 +/- 0.12 eV per molecule of carbon dioxide and 0.32 +/- 0.04 eV per molecule of methane, which is equivalent to doses deposited in just (2.0 +/- 0.5) x 10(6) yr in a typical molecular cloud. The results suggest further that the search for acetic acid dimers (CH3COOH)(2) toward star-forming regions has a significant potential to be successful. Finally, methyl hydroperoxide (CH3OOH) and dimethyl peroxide (CH3OOCH3), as identified previously in our laboratory, are predicted to be present in the interstellar medium, thus providing a homologous series of peroxides-HOOH, CH3OOH, and CH3OOCH3-to shed light on the interstellar oxygen chemistry.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000440621800002

The introduction of a second carbon source of citric acid during synthesis prevented the Co atoms from growing up, thus regulating the size of the cobalt nanoparticles. N atoms in N-doped graphene had more lone-pair electrons, making it easier to capture electrons from hydrated ions, and facilitating the dynamics procedure of HER. Furthermore, N dopant rendered larger positive charge density on the adjacent carbon atoms, which was conducive to OER and HER. At 10 mA cm(-2) of the current density, the CoNG/CC catalyst's overvoltage of HER was 78 mV, approaching that of 20% Pt/C (59 mV), an efficient precious metal electrocatalyst for HER, while its overvoltage of OER was about 225 mV, 12.5% lower than that of RuO2 (257 mV, a common precious metal oxide OER electrocatalyst). In addition, this Co-NG/CC composite bifunctional catalyst displayed good electrochemical stability in alkali solution and might be designed as a dual-function catalyst in the application of overall water splitting. The cell voltage of Co-NG/CC//CoNG/CC was only 1.66 V, approaching to that of full precious metal cell of Pt/C//RuO2 (1.52 V), and revealing the good commercial application prospects of this composite bifunctional catalyst.

R-TiO2:N,F could be prepared by nitridation of the rutile TiO2 (R-TiO2) and (NH4)(2)TiF6 mixture at 773 K. The prepared samples produced O-2 from aqueous AgNO3 solution under visible light irradiation, while R-TiO2 nitrided at the same temperature without any fluorine source showed negligible activity. The highest activity was obtained with the sample prepared at the (NH4)(2)TiF6/R-TiO2 ratio of 15/85, exhibiting water oxidation activity even in the presence of a reversible electron acceptor such as IO3- or Fe3+ with the aid of a RuO2 cocatalyst. Stoichiometric water splitting into H-2 and O-2 was achieved using a mixture of Ru/SrTiO3:Rh and RuO2/TiO2:N,F in the presence of [Co(bpy)(3)](3+/2+) (bpy = 2,2-bipyridine) as a shuttle redox mediator without noticeable degradation of activity under visible light and even under AM1.5G simulated sunlight. Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that appropriate nitrogen/fluorine codoping reduces the density of mid-gap states working as deep traps of photogenerated electrons, and increases the number of free electrons compared to only nitrogen-doped R-TiO2. Experimental results highlighted that the photocatalytic activity of R-TiO2:N,F could be enhanced by improving visible-light absorption capability through N/F codoping while suppressing the density of deep trap sites.									25	1	0	0	0	0	25			2398-4902			WOS:000443282700010

Here this work reports a novel nitrogen-doped 1D K2Ti6O13 nanorod (denoted as KTON hereafter) that exhibits obvious visible-light-responsive water splitting performance. The H-2 evolution rate was significantly promoted by fabricating 1D KTON nanorod and 2D graphitic carbon nitride heterostructure (denoted as KTON/C3N4), which was 18.65 mu mol.h(-1) with an apparent quantum yield of 0.04% at 420 nm. The detailed structural characterizations demonstrated formation of intimate interface to cause remarkably promoted charge separation and 10 times of promoted H-2 evolution rate on the type II heterostructure compared to KTON. Moreover, the heterostructure showed excellent photochemical stability in the experimental region. The work not only reports a novel visible-light-responsive water splitting photocatalyst, but also demonstrates the feasibility of fabricating intimate heterostructure between inorganic and organic/polymeric photocatalyst for promoting charge separation and photocatalytic performance.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000799074500001

However, the widespread commercialization of SOCs is still constrained by stability. To investigate the performance evolution mechanisms, fuel-cell, electrolysis, and reversible operations of an industrial-size (10 cm x 10 cm) SOC were conducted. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measured under open-circuit/a small DC bias and operating current was analyzed employing the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) method and equivalent circuit model (ECM) fitting. Under the fuel-cell and electrolysis modes, the resistances corresponding to the electrode processes held different change trends with increasing DC biases. Compared with the fuel-cell mode, the proportion of the resistance related to the gas diffusion and conversion processes of the fuel electrode was higher in the electrolysis mode. Meanwhile, the resistances associated with the charge transfer reaction, gas diffusion and conversion processes of fuel electrode increased faster in the electrolysis mode. Besides, through the evolution of j-V curves and resistances of electrode processes, the whole operation process was divided into the initial stage (first activation and then rapid-degradation) and the stable stage. In the postmortem analysis, Ni non-percolating, Ni coarsening and change of pore morphology in the fuel electrode were mainly observed. Combined with the detailed EIS analysis and microstructure changes, the dominant performance evolution mechanism in different stages of the overall operation process was proposed.Y									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0196-8904	1879-2227		WOS:000830157800002

However, the preparation and optimization of high-efficiency anode electrocatalysts are highly desirable yet challenging, which is an essential part in fuel cells. We thereby design a simple but efficient method and then synthesize a series of novel one dimension PtNi nanorods electrocatalysts. The as-prepared PtNi nanorods exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance towards alcohol oxidations in alkaline medium. The Pt3Ni nanorods with optimized composition show the best mass and activity of 4601.5 mA mg(-1) (11.4 mA cm(-2)) and 7260 mA mg(-1) (18.1 mA cm(-2)) towards glycerol oxidation reaction and ethylene glycol oxidation reaction respectively, 4.6 (5.4) and 6.1 (7.2) times higher than commercial Pt/C catalysts. The present work in situ offers a practical synthetic approach of electrocatalysts and their better catalytic properties in alcohol oxidation reactions, which has a promoting effect for development of liquid fuel cells.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000468717900022

It can be used as a probe of cosmic ray and X-ray ionization rates in molecular clouds as well as a tracer of oxygen chemistry. The deuterated variant of OH+, the OD+ ion, may also be present in the ISM despite the fact that it has not been detected yet. In this paper, we aim at providing quantitative insight into the OD+ chemistry and at accurately studying the possible formation and destruction processes of OD+ in the ISM. We study the formation and destruction of OD+ through the O+ + HD -> OD+ + H and OH+ + D <-> OD+ + H reactions that can occur in diffuse ISM. Reactive rate constants have been obtained from exact state-to-state quantum wave packet calculations for temperatures ranging from 10 to 1000 K. The new theoretical data are validated through a detailed comparison with available experimental data. The formation of OD+ is found to be less efficient than that of OH+. As a first application, the OD+/OH+ abundance ratio in ISM has been evaluated from a simple astrochemical model, and we found that this ratio can be larger than D/H abundance ratio only at low temperatures. These calculations may help in an astrochemical search of OD+ in cold ISM.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000562942600018	32687711	
J	Bondue, Christoph J.; Koper, Marc T. M.								A DEMS approach for the direct detection of CO formed during electrochemical CO2 reduction								JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				875		SI				113842	10.1016/j.jelechem.2020.113842				OCT 15 2020	2020	Observation of CO formed during electrochemical CO2 reduction using Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectrometry (DEMS) is complicated by the fragmentation of CO2 in the course of the ionization process. Since much more CO2 than CO enters the vacuum of the mass spectrometer, the ion current for mass 28 is dominated by the CO+-fragment of CO2. By reducing the cathode potential of the ion source of the mass spectrometer from-70 V to-27.5 V, fragmentation of CO2 is reduced to a negligible degree. This allows direct observation of electrochemically formed CO by measuring the ionic current for mass 28. We show that this method is superior to matrix calibration in which the ionic current for mass 44 corrected by the CO+/CO2+-intensity ratio is subtracted from the ionic current for mass 28. Using this method, we compare DEMS results for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 at gold electrodes obtained in two different cells, a conventional DEMS cell with the working electrode sputtered onto the membrane in contact with the vacuum and a flow cell where the interface to the vacuum is separated from the working electrode. We show that in the conventional cell at the interface between electrolyte and vacuum, the local CO2 concentration is reduced as the nearby vacuum interferes with the equilibria of reactions involving gases, and the local pH is increased. Therefore, in DEMS cells where the working electrode is positioned in the vicinity of the interface, the onset potential for CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution are shifted and the observed faradaic efficiency for CO2 reduction are considerably reduced compared to literature values. This can be rectified by using flow cells that allow a spatial separation between vacuum/electrolyte interface and working electrode. We describe how the Dual Thin Layer Cell can be calibrated for detecting CO, thus allowing quantification of evolved amounts of CO from the ionic current for mass 28. (C) 2020 The Authors.

However, examining these interfaces under operando conditions, where performance is typically evaluated and benchmarked, remains challenging, as it necessitates incorporating an operando probe during full electrochemical operation. In this study, we describe a custom electrochemical flow cell that enables near-surface-sensitive operando investigation of planar thin-film catalysts at significant hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) rates (in excess of -100 mA cm(-2)) using grazing incidence X-ray methods. Grazing-incidence X-ray spectroscopy and diffraction were implemented on the same sample under identical HER conditions, demonstrating how the combined measurements track changing redox chemistry and structure of Cu thin-film catalyst surfaces as a function of electrochemical conditions. The coupling of these methods with improved mass transport and hydrodynamic control establishes a new paradigm for operando measurement design, enabling unique insights into the key fundamental processes occurring at the catalyst-electrolyte interface.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000461722800004	30785434

To achieve this goal, a comprehensive understanding and precise description of structure-performance relationships of photocatalysts/catalysts are highly desirable. While photocatalysis/catalysis involves complex systems and processes, approximate descriptors have been proposed for sorting out simple pictures of complicated structure-performance relationships concerned. In this review, some important descriptors involved in photocatalyst/catalyst design including work function, dipole moment, d-band center, and Fermi softness are reviewed first with special attention being paid to their working mechanisms and applications. Then strategies of tuning photocatalytic/catalytic performance on the basis of these descriptors are outlined. Finally, challenges and opportunities for photocatalyst/catalyst design based on descriptor control are discussed.

The model was constructed following a heuristic approach and it consists of 16 elementary steps and a species space including 6 radical and 7 nonradical compounds. Applying inverse computations, the model can be assigned to experimentally observed data within very good agreement where most of the computed values for the kinetic parameters are found to be close to literature values. The respective experimental data is characterized by an autocatalytic time-evolution of tetralin hydroperoxide (HROOH) and of alpha-tetralone (RO) where in the first stage of autoxidation a remarkable very slow rate of the RO formation in respect to that of the HROOH formation can be observed, This effect is explicitly expressed by the transformation process of tetralyloxy radicals (HRO .) into alpha-tetralol radicals (. ROH) which react with oxygen yielding RO. The transformation is suggested to be catalyzed by alpha-tetralol (HROH) which accumulates autocatalytically during the radical chain process. Hence, the nonlinear formation of HROH leads to a switching in the transformation of HRO . into . ROH radicals which causes a growing rate of RO evolution. The autocatalytic nature of the overall process is explained by degenerate branching of one molecule of HROOH yielding radical species finally resulting into 2 tetralyl radicals (RH .). This process leads to a growing number of chain propagating reaction sequences involving RH . and tetralylperoxy radicals (HROO .) in which RH(2) and O-2 are consumed and HROOH is formed. Based on the fitting of experimental data the suggested general dynamic structure of the model is validated by computing the reaction fluxes vs. time of several mechanistic key steps. By computer simulations the model is also shown to predict the increase of product accumulation which can be observed experimentally if the autoxidation of RH(2) is started after an initial addition of HROH.

J	Gao, Jihui; Chen, Guoqing; Fu, Xiaolin; Yin, Yijun; Wu, Shaohua; Qin, Yukun								Enhancement mechanism of SO2 removal with calcium hydroxide in the presence of NO2								KOREAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING				29	2			263	269		10.1007/s11814-011-0157-7				FEB 2012	2012	The enhancement mechanism of SO2 removal by the presence of NO2 under low temperature and humid conditions was studied in a fixed bed reactor system. The presence of NO2 in the flue gas can enhance SO2 removal. The interaction between SO2 and NO2 in gas phase could not explain the effect of NO2 on SO2 removal under low-temperature and humid conditions. When Ca(NO3)(2) and Ca(NO2)(2) as additive were added on the surface of sorbent, the desulfurization activity of sorbent decreased. However, the sorbent pretreated by NO2 for a moment has higher SO2 removal. The oxidization of SO32- to SO42- and the evolution of sorbent surface structure in the presence of NO2 can explain the enhancement of SO2 removal by the presence of NO2. HSO3- and SO3- reacted with NO2 to form sulfate, which can accelerate the hydrolysis of SO2. The reaction between NO2 and Ca(OH)(2) can make the unreacted sorbet under the SO2 removal product exposed to the reactant gas.									2	1	0	0	1	0	3			0256-1115	1975-7220		WOS:000299648500019

Here we have synthesized Fe3C/Mo2C-containing N, P co-doped graphitic carbon derived from POM@ MOF-100 (Fe) (denoted as Fe3C/Mo2C@NPGC) via a "killing three birds with one stone" strategy. The Fe3C/Mo2C@NPGC catalyst demonstrates excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability towards HER with a low onset overpotential of 18 mV (vs. RHE), small Tafel slope of 45.2 mV dec(-1), as well as long-term durability for 10 h, which is one of the best non-noble metal HER catalysts in acidic media reported so far. Most importantly, this work opens up exciting opportunities for fabricating novel and highly efficient electrocatalysts to replace Pt or Pt-based catalysts utilizing POM-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as precursors.									139	5	0	0	4	0	140			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000368837800007

A novel feature of the DTF is its double-tube configuration that realizes direct determination of the char yield via experiments. This further enables investigations into the evolutions in the char yield, transformation of alkali and alkaline earth metallic (AAEM) species in chars, and char particle shape/morphology during rapid pyrolysis. The char yield decreases with the particle residence time but remains unchanged at 3.8 and 2.8% after 0.51 and 0.41 s for mallee and pine chars, respectively, indicating that the pyrolysis reactions are mostly completed. Similarly, the retention of AAEM species decreases with particle residence time, although the retention of AAEM species in pine char continues to decrease after 0.41 s. The continuous reduction in O/C and H/C molar ratios after 0.41 s suggests that the nascent char continues to experience thermochemical condensation reactions that lead to the scission of oxygen-containing groups. Chemical fractionation of mallee char with particle residence times of similar to 0.32 and similar to 0.51 s shows an increase in the amount of ion-exchangeable Na and K retained in partially pyrolyzed mallee wood and then a decrease as pyrolysis continues. These can be attributed to the transformation of water-soluble Na and K into ion-exchangeable Na and K, with partial release as a result of char deoxygenation. However, Mg and Ca, presented mainly in water-soluble or ion-exchangeable forms in the parent biomass, were increasingly transformed into acid-soluble or acid-insoluble forms. As pyrolysis progresses, the char particle length and diameter continue to shrink and char particles become increasingly spherical. Mallee wood shows stronger resistance to deformation because its original elongated shape is maintained, while pine char particles rapidly melt at the early stage of pyrolysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000707030800037		
J	KOCKS, P; ROSS, J								KINETIC-MODEL FOR (DAMPED) OSCILLATIONS OF TRANSTHYLAKOID PH IN PLANTS								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY				99	44			16490	16497		10.1021/j100044a044				NOV 2 1995	1995	We formulate a biochemical reaction mechanism for the damped oscillations in the chlorophyll fluorescence, oxygen evolution, and carbon dioxide assimilation observed in leaves of higher (C-3) plants when a leaf in an atmosphere containing a high CO2 concentration is suddenly subjected to strong illumination. The mechanism is based on the type of gating behavior responsible for the rapid firing of nerve cells: the ATP-synthetase of the thylakoid membrane has a similar gating property that is responsive to changes in the Delta pH across the thylakoid membrane. The negative resistance of the gating behavior is used to create a positive feedback cycle in the rate of change of the Delta pH across the thylakoid membrane. The positive feedback cycle in conjunction with a slow, proton-gated, leak leads to oscillations in the Delta pH across the thylakoid membrane. There is no need to introduce a delay in the availability of inorganic phosphate to the enzymes of the Calvin cycle, as was done in earlier approaches of modeling damped oscillations. The kinetics of the proposed reaction mechanism is described by three differential equations which are solved numerically. Despite its simplicity, the model predicts oscillations (either to a stable focus or on a limit cycle) in the Delta pH across the thylakoid membrane (and consequently chlorophyll fluorescence) that are on the same time scale of the pH changes in the lumen under nonoscillatory conditions. The predicted damped oscillations in transthylakoid Delta pH are qualitatively similar to the changes to chlorophyll fluorescence quenching observed experimentally. The model also predicts an increase in the amplitude of oscillations under supersaturating CO2 conditions and a resonance when the activity of the Calvin cycle is perturbed periodically, observed for the first time as reported in a companion article. The model does not predict the dependence of the resonance response on the phase of the perturbation nor the alteration in average nonphotochemical quenching and average photochemical efficiency reported in the companion article.									10	0	0	0	10	0	10			0022-3654			WOS:A1995TD47800044

The solid maceral residues were subjected to elemental and microscopical analysis and studied by IR and C-13 CP/MAS NMR spectroscopy with respect to structural modifications.The maximum pyrolytic weight loss amounts to 60% of the initial organic matter in the case of vitrinite and to 85% for alginite, the onset of degradation reactions being shifted to higher temperatures with increasing rate of heating. Both infrared and NMR spectra of the vitrinite samples indicate a rapid decomposition of the cellulose component upon heating whereas lignin related structures such as aromatic ether linkages remain remarkably stable. The main hydrocarbon release from vitrinite occurs at very early evolution stages (T(max) = 296-degrees-C, R(m) = 0.20% at 0.1-degrees-C/min; T(max) = 337-degrees-C, R(m) = 0.23% at 2.0-degrees-C/min). Hydrocarbon generation from alginite requires higher temperatures (T(max) = 388 and 438-degrees-C) and is completed within a distinctly narrower temperature range.The pronounced increase of vitrinite reflectance between 350 and 670-degree-C seems to be associated with a rather time-consuming reorganization of the residual organic material. The concomitant growth of polyaromatic units is illustrated by the increasing intensity ratio of the aromatic ring stretching vibration bands at 1600 and 1500 cm-1. These reactions are moreover marked by increasing loss of phenolic oxygen and by increasing conversion of aliphatic carbon into fixed aromatic carbon.									45	0	0	0	3	0	45			0146-6380			WOS:A1990EU55500025

It has reputedly shown R CrB type variations and has therefore also been likened to the hot R CrB stars MV Sgr and V348 Sgr.The photospheric parameters of DY Cen have been derived from optical high-resolution spectra by the method of fine analysis, using up-to-date atomic data and new line-blanketed model atmospheres. The principal results are T(eff) = 19 500 K, log g = 2.15, n(H)/n(He) = 0.1, n(C)/n(He) = 0.01. Broad-band visual and ultraviolet spectrophotometry also yield T(eff) = 19 500 K, with E(B-V) = 0.5. The hydrogen abundance indicates that EHe stars show a much larger range of hydrogen-deficiency than previously supposed. Assuming a He-shell model, a mass approximately 0.8 M. may be estimated for DY Cen.DY Cen is a metal poor EHe star; the composition supports evidence for an anticorrelation between hydrogen and iron abundances in EHe stars. Its previous evolution is reflected in the chemistry of the atmosphere, which contains enriched nitrogen from CNO-cycle hydrogen burning, carbon from 3alpha helium burning, and oxygen and possibly neon from alpha-capture reactions.A weak emission-line spectrum principally contains lines due to H I, He I, C II and Si II. By analogy with BD-9-degrees-4395, it is probably due to recombination in a shell, or extended atmosphere, with a temperature slightly below T(eff).									44	0	0	0	0	0	44			0004-6361			WOS:A1993KU56700022

In this work, a series of 2D co-catalyst nitrogen-doped graphenes with the different bond states of doped nitrogen were synthesized under modified synthetic conditions, resulting in different surface catalytic hydrogen peroxide generation activities. Electrochemical analysis proves that pyrrolic nitrogen doped in graphene plays an important role in improving two-electron-transferring reactions on the surface of nitrogen-doped graphene for hydrogen peroxide generation, which depresses further reduction of hydrogen peroxide into hydroxyl radicals. Benefiting from the synergistic role of improved charge separation and enhanced surface-selective reaction activity of the co-catalyst nitrogen-doped graphene, 2D/2D graphitic carbon nitride/nitrogen-doped graphene heterostructure composites produce 56.22 mu mol hydrogen peroxide under visible light irradiation in 4 h, which is 2.77 times higher than the 20.28 mu mol of pure graphitic carbon nitride.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2398-4902			WOS:000626710500020

The sample suite is representative of RDG both distal (>5 km) and proximal (<1 km) to the hydrothermal breccias of the Olympic Dam Breccia Complex (ODBC), which host Fe-oxide Cu-Au-(U) mineralisation at Olympic Dam. Microscopic observations and quantitative analyses indicate that a range of feldspar reactions have taken place within the RDG hosting the Olympic Dam deposit. An early phase of igneous plagioclase (similar to An(27-34)) is recognised, along with a more abundant, less-calcic plagioclase (similar to An(12-20)) both displaying rapakivi and anti-rapakivi textures with alkali feldspar. Alkali feldspars (-Or(55)Ab(43)An(2)) record post-magmatic evolution from cryptoperthite to patch perthite. Subsequent patch perthite is overprinted by highly porous, near end-member albite and K-feldspar, while plagioclase undergoes replacement by albite + sericite +/- Ba-rich K-feldspar. In sericite-hematite altered and mineralised RDG along the margin of the ODBC, sericite replaces all plagioclase, whereas red-stained, Fe rich K-feldspar persists. Sulphide-uranium-rare earth element mineralisation is observed in association with hydrothermal feldspars, and increases in abundance with proximity to the orebody. Petrographic observations and whole-rock geochemistry illustrate the transformation of plagioclase and alkali feldspar from igneous to hydro thermal processes, and indicate that hydrothermal albite and K-feldspar formed within the RDG without the need for an external source of alkalis. Feldspar geothermometry indicates a minimum crystallisation temperature of 765 degrees C at 2.2 kbar for alkali feldspar (pressure estimate obtained using plagioclase-amphibole geobarometry) followed by a range of lower temperature transformations.

Nitrogen dioxide treatment at 200-degrees-C for 70 h results in a mixed-phase material containing superconducting YBa2Cu3O6.9 that exhibits onset of superconductivity at 91.5 K and a midpoint at 88 K. During a 70-h exposure of YBa2Cu3O6 to NO2 at 200-degrees-C, a mixture of oxidation and degradation products is formed, including YBa2Cu3O6.9 (61% by weight) and Ba(NO3)2 (23% by weight). Heating the NO2-treated product to 900-degrees-C results in the evolution of NO, NO2, and O2; cooling the sample and annealing at 400-degrees-C in an O2 stream generates the superconducting oxide.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:A1991FK03900003

Both the geometric and electronic structures of the vanadium and molybdenum metal centers of the catalyst change dynamically under the reaction conditions used. Moreover, the selectivity of the catalyst exhibits a pronounced correlation with the degree of reduction and the solid-state kinetics of the reoxidation process. The corresponding extent of reoxidation curve can be simulated with a solid-state kinetic model assuming three-dimensional diffusion as the rate-limiting step. Thus, the partially reduced catalyst exhibits a rate constant of the bulk-diffusion limited reoxidation, coinciding with the temporal evolution of the selectivity of the catalyst.

In this work, a highly active Co-N-doped graphene bifunctional electrocatalyst (Co-N-C/rGO) was prepared by a very mild and simple method. With graphene oxide as the substrate, gluconic acid acts as a dispersion of cobalt and an additional carbon source, while urea acts as a nitrogen source and anchoring cobalt. Co-N-C/rGO showed excellent catalytic performance for the ORR, which even exceeded that of commercial Pt/C. In 0.1 M KOH, the onset potential and half-wave potential of Co-N-C/rGO are 1.04 V and 864 mV, respectively, which are higher than those of most of the similar carbon materials reported. Compared with Pt/C, the half wave potential loss is reduced by 35 mV, and it still shows obvious four-electron transfer characteristics and higher Tafel slope performance. Co-N-C/rGO-based primary liquid ZABs display a higher galvanostatic discharge capacity as well as higher power density. Moreover, we improved the traditional PVA electrolyte, and designed and prepared a PVA + PEO + GO electrolyte with better performance. The flexible ZABs fabricated using air electrodes containing Co-N-C/rGO and this solid electrolyte demonstrate good performance, with a high open circuit potential (1.49 V) and large peak power density (57 mW cm(-2)). In addition, the good HER catalytic performance of Co-N-C/rGO is characterized by a low Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1) and an overpotential of 220 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2).									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2398-4902			WOS:000593581500022

It was shown that CO2 inhibited photoproduction of H-2 as a result of the photosynthetic production of O-2 whereas photoreduction of C2H2 by these cyanobacteria was not inhibited by O-2 concentrations up to 20% in the assay gas phase. In contrast to the wild type of A. variabilis and of A. azollae, H-2 photoproduction by the hydrogenase-impaired mutant A. variabilis PK84 showed only a slight dependence on O-2 concentration. Thus, in the wild-type Anabaena the decrease in the observed rate of H-2 evolution at elevated O-2 concentrations could be the result of an increase in hydrogenase-mediated uptake of H-2 via an oxyhydrogen reaction.

The spectra showed an absorption band attributable to the Si-O-Si stretching vibration, thereby demonstrating the formation of surface oxides in the evaporation chamber. The present in situ measurements further revealed the formation of various Si-H bonding groups which could not be clearly observed in the samples exposed to air. The surface oxide layers containing Si-H bonding groups are thought to grow during the gas-evaporation process through the reaction of evaporated Si atoms with residual O2, H-2 and H2O molecules. The evolution of the oxide to form native oxide layers was also studied by monitoring the changes in absorption spectra upon exposure to air. It was found that the oxidation of the Si microcrystals proceeds much more slowly than in Si wafers.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0021-4922			WOS:A1993ML96600003		
J	GREENBAUM, NL; MAUZERALL, D								EFFECT OF IRRADIANCE LEVEL ON DISTRIBUTION OF CHLOROPHYLLS BETWEEN PS-II AND PS-I AS DETERMINED FROM OPTICAL-CROSS-SECTIONS								BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA				1057	2			195	207		10.1016/S0005-2728(05)80102-1				MAR 29 1991	1991	The number of antenna chlorophyll molecules transferring the energy of absorbed photons to the reaction center of either photosystem (PS) II or PS I (i.e., the 'size' of the PS), the numbers of RCII and I and the Chl b/a ratio vary with growth irradiance level to optimize the efficiency of energy harvesting and utilization. The effects of photoadaptation on structural organization are best studied by methods measuring size-dependent properties in vivo. The effective optical cross-section, sigma, or area available for photon capture determined from the light-saturation characteristics of PS-specific signals following single-turnover flashes provides this information. In these experiments, sigma of PS II was calculated from the light-saturation of O2 evolution, and that of PS I from the amplitude of a post-illumination respiratory oscillation. Cells grown under different irradiance levels were probed at wavelengths where both Chl a + b or only Chl a absorb. RC stoichiometries Chl b/a ratios, and the in vivo absorption-sigma per chlorophyll were also measured. At all wavelengths studied, cross sections of both PS II and PS I were fit to a single size; deviation from Poissonian curves in regions of strong absorption were the result of absorption of actinic radiation within a single cell and not of heterogeneity of PS size. The yield of O2 evolution following flashes at 723 nm was within 10% of that at shorter wavelengths. Photoadaptation to high light resulted in a greater decrease in the number of RCI than of RCII and in a decreased Chl b/a ratio in PS II. For all irradiance levels, the sum of the number of RC's times the number of chlorophylls per PS for PS II and PS I equals (+/- 15%) the total extractable Chl/cell; therefore, to our knowledge for the first time, and by optical means, all chlorophyll can be assigned to the two photosystems.									22	0	0	0	18	0	22			0006-3002			WOS:A1991FG84400004

In this work, we reported a facile synthesis and remarkable activity improvement of NiO/RP composite for water splitting. As a result, the 3% NiO/RP composite exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity for H2 production (57.27 mmol g-1 h-1), which is 68.56 times higher than that of pure RP (0.82 mmol g-1 h-1) under visible light (l > 420 nm) irradiation. The investigation of photocarriers separation mechanism indicated NiO/RP composite applied a Z-scheme mechanism to promote the photocarriers separation. This is a potential strategy to dramatically enhance the photocatalytic activity of RP for H2 evolution using transition metal oxide to efficiently separate the photocarriers under light irradiation.

Herein, we adopted a simple in situ photodeposition strategy by coupling Mn0.5Cd0.5S with non-noble co-catalyst Ni2P to construct Ni2P/Mn0.5Cd0.5S composites and achieved obviously improved H-2 amount (31.83 mmol/h/ g) in visible-light region, which is nearly 2.8 times than that of pure Mn0.5Cd0.5S. Such photocatalytic performance is in a relatively superior position among MnxCd1-xS-based photocatalysts. The apparent quantum efficiency of Ni2P/Mn0.5Cd0.5S-7 composites reaches 32% at 420 nm. Through optical and photoelectrochemical measurements, a possible mechanism was proposed, it was found that the interface between metalloid Ni2P and Mn0.5Cd0.5S contacts closely, which facilitates transfer and separation of charge carriers, thus promotes the reduction of H+ to H-2. This study provides a new design of cut-price, high-efficiency photocatalyst for H-2 evolution. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

At low concentrations of heavy metal (Cd, Sn, and Cu) chlorides, the content of chlorophyll per fresh weight decreased. However, the rate of O-2 evolution calculated per chlorophyll basis, DeltaO(2)/(Deltat chlorophyll), increased. High concentrations of heavy metals significantly suppressed plant development and inhibited photosynthetic O-2 evolution. In contrast, plant treatment with MgCl2 (10(-5)-10(-3) M) resulted in an increase in the content of chlorophyll and a stimulation of leaf photosynthetic activity. A positive correlation between the F-M/F-T ratio and DeltaO(2)/(Deltat chlorophyll) (r = 0.89, P > 0.999) was found. We observed a negative correlation between the values of P/P-0 of EPR signal I (white/far-red light) and DeltaO(2)/(Deltat chlorophyll) (r = -0.89, P > 0.999). The data obtained indicate nonspecific and nonmonotone changes in the photosynthetic apparatus of plants treated with heavy metals: low concentrations of heavy metals (10(-7)-10(-6) M) stimulated photosynthetic activity, whereas high concentrations (10(-4)-10(-3) M) suppressed it.									16	0	0	0	15	0	17			1021-4437	1608-3407		WOS:000166724200008

The reactivity of MnxMoOy- (x = 1, 2; y = 3, 4) clusters toward H2O was investigated via time-of-flight mass spectrometry with clear evidence of cluster oxidation and corresponding H-2 production, specifically for MnxMoO3- (x = 1, 2) clusters. Unlike previously studied MoxOy- clusters, which assumed a broad distribution of stoichiometries (typically x <= y <= 3x), both MnMoOy- and Mn2MoOy- preferentially formed y = 3 and 4 compositions in significant quantities under our source conditions. The electronic and molecular structures of the MnxMoOy (x = 1, 2; y = 3, 4) anion and neutral clusters were probed with anion photoelectron spectroscopy and analyzed with supporting density functional theory calculations. Our studies suggest that both metal centers are involved in initial cluster-water complex formation, while Mo is the center that undergoes oxidation; hence, reactivity terminates when Mo is saturated in its highest oxidation state of +6. Across these four clusters, Mn remains relatively reduced and is stable in a high-spin electronic configuration. The preferential reactivity of water molecules toward the Mo center rather than Mn is rationalized by the much lower relative oxophilicity of Mn.

Chemical systems that capture life's essential characteristics-replication, metabolism and compartmentalization-offer a route to understanding this momentous process. The synthesis of life, whether based on canonical biomolecules or fully synthetic molecules, requires the functional integration of these three characteristics. Here we show how a system of fully synthetic self-replicating molecules, on recruiting a cofactor, acquires the ability to transform thiols in its environment into disulfide precursors from which the molecules can replicate. The binding of replicator and cofactor enhances the activity of the latter in oxidizing thiols into disulfides through photoredox catalysis and thereby accelerates replication by increasing the availability of the disulfide precursors. This positive feedback marks the emergence of light-driven protometabolism in a system that bears no resemblance to canonical biochemistry and constitutes a major step towards the highly challenging aim of creating a new and completely synthetic form of life.The integration of replication with metabolism represents a key step in the transition of chemistry into biology. Now, it has been shown that a self-replicator can recruit and activate two different photocatalytic cofactors, which then catalyse the synthesis of the precursors for the replicator.									27	0	0	0	7	0	27			1755-4330	1755-4349		WOS:000543488100008	32591744

Very recently, electrocatalytic reduction of nitrogen (N-2) has been demonstrated to be a clean and sustainable approach to produce NH3, which has aroused widespread attention. All types of electrocatalysts have been developed and designed for the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). To achieve both high catalytic performance and selectivity, electrocatalysts must be rationally designed to optimize the mass transport, chemi(physi) sorption, and transfer of protons and electrons. In this review, we summarize the recent developments on electrocatalysts for N-2 fixation. First, we discuss the reaction mechanisms of the NRR. Second, three categories of electrocatalysts according to their chemical compositions are surveyed. Then, the effects of different types of electrolytes on NRR activity and electrolyte choice are also summarized. Finally, the existing challenges and future perspectives are discussed.									204	15	0	0	7	0	207			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000459331600004

This investigation concentrated on the evolution characteristics of anthracite-N during pre-oxidation processes under O-2/H2O atmospheres. A typical high rank coal was used in this study. Isothermal pre-oxidation tests were performed under different reaction atmospheres (O-2: 3, 6, 10 vol %; H2O: 0, 10 vol%), and the results illustrated that the enhancement of the O-2 volumetric fraction and the addition of H2O expressed positive effects on promoting the release of anthracite-N (16.7% -> 31.7%) rapidly, and more structural nitrogen tended to be removed as HCN and NH3 (0.85% -> 5.48%) during the O-2/H2O preoxidation process. The XPS results demonstrated that the increasing O-2 volumetric fraction and addition of H2O in the pre-oxidation atmosphere led to the enrichment of pyrrole (N-5), which was the precursor of HCN, at the expense of pyridine (N-6) and quaternary nitrogen (N-Q). Furthermore, the increasing pre-oxidation degree accelerated the attachment of oxygen atoms on the anthracite surface, generating massive amounts of reactive functional groups. The Raman results illustrated that the variations in the chemical structure of nitrogencontaining complexes was caused by the cracking of condensed aromatic structures into reactive fragments or defect structures due to carbon-O-2/H2O reactions during the pre-oxidation process, leading to massive amounts of internal structural nitrogen exposed to the edge of aromatic structures (N-Q/N-6 -> N-5). When the preoxidation occurred in an atmosphere consisting of 10 vol% O-2 and 10 vol% H2O, the conversion ratio of anthracite-N to NO during the whole pre-oxidation process reached the minimum value of 5.31%, and the reactivity of the semi-char was the highest.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000612064900004

Herein, we have synthesized a tungsten (W6+)-doped vertically grown nanosheet-like structure of Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH on carbon cloth for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in KOH solution. Doping with W-6+ ions in Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH is performed by electrodeposition, followed by the hydrothermal method. Various amounts of the dopant (W6+) are used to confirm the role of W, but the W0.1Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH nanosheet shows the highest efficiency in electrocatalysis. The surface composition and the oxidation state of the developed electrocatalyst are confirmed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. After doping, the lattice suffers a tensile strain, which is confirmed by Raman and X-ray powder diffraction analyses. Field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy analyses confirm the nanosheet morphology of W0.1Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH. The electrocatalyst, W0.1Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH, has a lower value of overpotential of 56 and 293 mV to obtain current densities of 10 and 50 mA/cm(2) for HER and OER, respectively, in a basic medium. The corresponding Tafel slope values are 63.5 and 48.2 mV dec(-1) for HER and OER, respectively. In W0.1Ni(OH)(2)/ NiOOH, the W6+ ion is a d(0) system that behaves as a strong Lewis acid and helps in electron pulling from Ni2+ ions, which facilitates the formation of Ni3+ ions as an active site for HER and OER. The electron pulling nature of the W6+ ion is further confirmed from Bader's charge analysis. Moreover, the synergistic effect between Ni2+ and W6+ ions plays an important role in a higher electrocatalytic efficiency. Density functional theory calculations revealed an increase in the Gibbs free energy of H adsorption in the presence of W, suggesting an enhanced HER activity for W0.1Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5				2574-0970		WOS:000757810700001

The powders loaded under an argon atmosphere and milled up to 170 h with and without interruption of the milling process were compared. A steady state of Fe-Cr alloying was reached within the first 12 h. The reflections corresponding to a new phase with an fcc-CrN structure were found in XRD patterns of powders milled for a long time with interruption. The differential thermal analysis of powders milled over 12 h with interruption shows an exothermic peak at 625.5-653 degrees C, ascribed to the coarsening of the fcc-CrN, and an endothermic reaction above 1000 degrees C accompanied by a mass loss in thermogravimetric analysis. (Cr,Fe)(2)O-3 and retained austenite were also found upon the heating of as-milled (with interruption) powders to different temperatures. The endothermic feature was associated with the decomposition of CrN accompanied by the degassing of N-2. The observed phenomenon was explained to be the manifestation of contamination with nitrogen and oxygen from the air during the milling; the rate of contamination with nitrogen was estimated to be 0.011 mass% h(-1). The contamination level depends on the degree of alloying at the moment of the interruption of milling process. The contamination of the powders milled without interruption of milling process was insignificant. The experimental conditions described in this work can be further developed for the removal of impurities (e.g. nitrogen, nitrides, oxides) from alloyed ferritic steel powders.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1388-6150	1588-2926		WOS:000376087800005

The rate for nonadiabatic PCET is expressed in terms of a time-dependent probability flux correlation function. The impact of the proton donor-acceptor and solvent dynamics on the probability flux is examined. The dynamical behavior of the probability flux correlation function is dominated by a solvent damping term that depends on the energy gap correlation function. The proton donor-acceptor motion does not impact the dynamical behavior of the probability flux correlation function but does influence the magnitude of the rate. The approximations previously invoked for the calculation of PCET rates are tested. The effects of solvent damping on the proton donor-accept or vibrational motion are found to be negligible, and the short-time solvent approximation, in which only equilibrium fluctuations of the solvent are considered, is determined to be valid for these types of reactions. The analysis of PCET reactions is compared to previous analyses of single electron and proton transfer reactions. The dynamical behavior is qualitatively similar for all three types of reactions, but the time scale of the decay of the probability flux correlation function is significantly longer for single proton transfer than for PCET and single electron transfer due to a smaller solvent reorganization energy for proton transfer.

The possibility of tuning the metal-ligand junctions of the MOF architecture opens new avenues to design robust, extended heterostructures for addressing the present-day energy challenges. Interestingly, despite having detailed crystallographic information, it is often difficult to envisage the interplay of charge transport (electrons and ions), mass transport (pore system) together with the specific effects of the molecularly defined reaction center of MOFs for a given electrocatalytic reaction. Here, guidelines are offered for judiciously engineering the electronic structure of MOFs to deliver targeted electrocatalytic function. Some of the pivotal works on MOF-based materials for electrocatalysis are discussed, which can be correlated to the biological models in terms of their structural resemblance and an instructive insight is provided about the "new chemistry" that can be explored based on the lessons learned from nature in combination with the theoretical understanding of the energetics of the reactions.									65	6	0	0	5	0	65			2366-9608			WOS:000484495900007

To achieve the progressive milestones, along with the developments in the architecture of cathodes, anodes, and electrolytes, understanding its failure mode is equally important. Under an unrestricted charge-discharge protocol, cyclability of nonaqueous Li-O-2 batteries are limited to only a few cycles. This report examines an additive-free ether-based Li-O-2 battery in the perspective of identifying the origin of possible side reactions and their affiliations to integral components of the battery. Structural and compositional changes during every charge-discharge sequence are studied using bottom-up sequential tear-down analysis. The substantial increase in impedance and corresponding decrease in capacities after every cycle are interrelated to the amount of electrode passivation resulting from the discharge products and electrolyte decomposition. From the tear-down analysis, it is approximated that, among the total capacity loss, approximate to 55%is attributed to the cathode, approximate to 28% of the loss corresponds to the anode, and approximate to 17% is attributed to the electrolyte, given that battery failure instigates from the "reactive oxygen species". Electrochemically formed Li2O2 via the superoxide pathway induces large decomposition overpotentials up to 4.6 V versus Li/Li+ because of its overrated reactivity with electrolytes and carbon supports. On the contrary, efficient decomposition of chemically formed Li2O2 below 3.9 V proves that the extra charge potential observed for electrochemically formed Li2O2 is in fact consumed for the decomposition of irreversibly formed side products via the superoxide pathway. Spontaneous reactivity of Li2O2 and trivial reactivity of Li2O highlight the need of advanced strategies to maneuver oxygen red-ox in selective pathways that unalter the electrolyte and electrodes, and the necessity of their synchronized performance for the evolution of practical Li-O-2 batteries.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000480498600042	31298520

This model considers eight lumped reactions (synthesis of amino acids, both non forming and forming bases, nucleic acids synthesis, both RNA and DNA, xanthan production, total sugar metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation and maintenance energy) and eight key compounds (biomass, ammonium, RNA, DNA, intracellular proteins, xanthan, sucrose and dissolved oxygen). Six runs under different temperatures and different initial nitrogen concentrations have been carried out. Parameter values of the model have been calculated by fitting experimental data of the six runs, using a multiple-response non-linear regression technique coupled to a fourth order Runge-Kutta algorithm. The kinetic model with the parameter values calculated is able to describe in close agreement with experimental data the concentration evolution of the eight key compounds previously mentioned in all the runs performed.Moreover, the structured kinetic model is able to predict the behavior of the system when some operational conditions are changed, such as temperature and initial nitrogen concentration, and also different oxygen transport rates, predicting different xanthan production rates depending on the operational conditions and medium composition (nitrogen source concentration).

Objective Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) develop systemic physiological changes that could increase the risk of severe evolution of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and result in atypical clinical features of COVID-19 with possible delay in both diagnosis and treatment. We evaluated differences in clinical features and evolution of COVID-19 between people with SCI and able-bodied individuals. Setting The study was conducted in an Italian inpatient rehabilitation referral center for individuals with SCI during the lockdown for the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We compared clinical information between patients with SCI and able-bodied healthcare workers of the same center who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction. Results Overall, 15 out of the 25 SCI patients admitted to the center and 17 out of the 69 healthcare workers tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients with SCI exhibited a significantly more advanced age and a higher prevalence of comorbidities. Nevertheless, no significant differences in clinical expression of COVID-19 and treatment strategies were observed between the two groups. All hospitalized subjects were treated in nonintensive care units and no deaths occurred in either group. Conclusions This study does not support the supposed notion that COVID-19 could exhibit atypical clinical features or a worse evolution in the frail population of people with SCI.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2058-6124			WOS:000706364300002	32753638

In this study, we present novel biomimetic hierarchical nanocoral reef materials as efficient and durable electrocatalysts for alkaline water splitting. Our nanocoral reef catalyst has a unique structure consisting of Ni(Co,Fe)P nanosheet (NS) algae and WOx nanowire (NW) corals. The WOx NW corals effectively transport charges (e(-)/h(+)) to the Ni(Co,Fe)P NS algae through a 1D directional structure. The ultrathin 2D Ni(Co,Fe)P NS algae grown on the WOx NW corals provide an abundance of active sites for splitting water molecules into H-2 and O-2. As a result, our hierarchical 2D-NS/1D-NW-structured NiCoP-WOx (HER) and NiFeP-WOx (OER) catalysts demonstrate excellent activities, requiring low overpotentials of 49 and 270 mV, respectively, to generate a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Additionally, they exhibit high electrochemical stability for over 60 h in 1 M KOH. In addition, the overall water splitting (OWS) system, NiCoP-WOx(HER)||NiFeP-WOx(OER) requires a cell voltage of 1.51 V to generate a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This value is very low compared to other reported transition metal phosphides. The biomimetic engineering presented in the current study provides not only efficient electrocatalysts but also a promising, useful strategy to develop functional 1D/2D hierarchical materials for advanced energy applications.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000642225900001

By means of first-principle calculations, we proposed a series of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal borides (MB) (M = Sc, Ti, V, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta and W) monolayer as NRR catalysts. These 2D MBenes exhibit high stability, metallic electronic band structures and the electrene characteristics which contribute to the NRR catalytic activity. Large amounts of active sites accelerate the NRR reaction, and the high selectivity towards NRR inhibits the HER process. We screened out four MBenes: TiB, YB, ZrB and MoB, with favorable limiting overpotentials of 0.64, 0.68, 0.65 and 0.68 V, respectively, which are promising for N-2 fixation applications. This work not only enriches the MBene family, but also provides a feasible strategy for the design of NRR catalysts.									27	1	0	0	0	0	27			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000580627000034

Ala substitutions were introduced in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to investigate the roles of these residues and the hydrogen-bond network on electron transfer between the primary plastoquinone acceptor, Q(A), and the secondary plastoquinone acceptor, Q(B), of the quinone-Fe-acceptor complex. All mutants assembled PS II; however, an increase in the PS II to PS I ratio was apparent, particularly in the E244A:Y246A double mutant. The mutants also showed impaired oxygen evolution and retarded chlorophyll a fluorescence decays following single turnover actinic flashes, which appeared to be primarily due to reduced Q(B) binding in the E244A strain and an enhanced back reaction with the S2 state of the oxygen-evolving complex in the Y246A mutant. Impaired PS II in the Y246A and E244A:Y246A mutants resulted in inactivation of the psbA gene encoding D1. The Y246A and E244A:Y246A mutants also showed high light sensitivity whereas the E244A mutant showed enhanced resilience towards photodamage. Unlike the control strain, all of the mutants were insensitive to the addition of formate or bicarbonate in assays following chlorophyll decay kinetics that reflect electron transfer between Q(A) and Q(B), suggesting the bicarbonate binding environment was perturbed. Our data also indicate that waters W582 and W622 (PDB: 4UB6) have essential roles in maintaining the architecture of the acceptor side of PS II.									10	0	0	0	9	0	10			0005-2728	1879-2650		WOS:000486134900002	31336104

Following synthesis by galvanic displacement, the nanowires had Pt surface areas of 90 m(2) g(Pt)(-1). The nanowire specific exchange current densities were 2-3 times greater than commercial nanoparticles and may benefit from the extended nanostructure morphology that avoids fringe facets and produces higher quantities of Pt{100}. Hydrogen annealing was used to alloy Pt and Ni zones and compress the Pt lattice. Following annealing, the nanowire activity improved to 4 times greater than the as-synthesized wires and 10 times greater than Pt nanoparticles. Density functional theory calculations were performed to investigate the influence of lattice compression and exposed facet on the water-splitting reaction; it was found that at a lattice of 3.77 angstrom, the (100) facet of a Pt-skin grown on Ni3Pt weakens hydrogen binding and lowers the barrier to water-splitting as compared to pure Pt(100). Moreover, the activation energy of water-splitting on the (100) facet of a Pt-skin grown on Ni3Pt is particularly advantageous at 0.66 eV as compared to the considerably higher 0.90 eV required on (111) surfaces of pure Pt or Pt-skin grown on Ni3Pt. This favorable effect may be slightly mitigated during further optimization procedures such as acid leaching near-surface Ni, necessary to incorporate the nanowires into electrolyzer membrane electrode assemblies. Exposure to acid resulted in slight dealloying and Pt lattice expansion, which reduced half-cell activity, but exposed Pt surfaces and improved single-cell performance. Membrane electrode assembly performance was kinetically 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than Ni and slightly better than Pt nanoparticles while at one tenth the Pt loading. These electrocatalysts potentially exploit the highly active {100} facets and provide an ultralow Pt group metal option that can enable anion exchange membrane electrolysis, bridging the gap to proton exchange membrane-based systems.									13	3	0	0	1	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000569376700026

Nanotube architectures were tuned by thermal annealing treatments. As-synthesized nanotubes are composed of nanoparticulate, metallic platinum and hydrous ruthenium oxide whose respective thicknesses depend on the sample chemical composition. The Pt-decorated, hydrous Ru oxide nanotubes may be thermally annealed to promote a series of chemical and physical changes to the nanotube structures, including alloy formation, crystallite growth, and morphological evolution. Annealed Pt-Ru alloy nanotubes and their assynthesized analogs demonstrate relatively high specific activities for the oxidation of methanol. As-synthesized, mixed-phase Pt Ru nanotubes (0.39 mA/cm(2)) and metallic alloyed Pt64Ru36NTs (0.33 mA/cm(2)) have considerably higher area-normalized activities than PtRu black (0.22 mA/cm(2)) at 0.65 V vs RHE.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			1944-8244			WOS:000355055000008	25905666

Herein, we report the preparation of flower-like cobalt vanadium selenide/nickel copper selenide (CoVSe/NiCuSe) microspheres with three-dimensional hierarchical structure of micropore growth on copper wire for a flexible fiber microsupercapacitor (microSC) and overall water splitting. The CoV-LDH microspheres are anchored on the dendrite-like NiCu nanostructured Cu wire using a hydrothermal method (CoV-LDH/NiCu@CW). The sulfidation and selenization of CoV-LDH/NiCu was carried out through the ion-exchange reaction of OH- with sulfide and selenide ions to obtain CoVS/NiCuS@CW and CoVSe/NiCuSe@CW electrodes, respectively. Benefitting from the unique structure, the flower-like CoVSe/NiCuSe@CW microspheres exhibit better electrochemical performance compared with other as-prepared fiber-shaped electrodes. As an electrode active material for microSC, CoVSe/NiCuSe microspheres exhibit a specific capacitance of 35.40 F cm(-3) at 4 mA cm(-2), and maintain 281.25 F cm(-3) even at a high current density of 83 mA cm(-2), indicating outstanding charge storage capacitance and excellent rate capability. Moreover, the assembled flexible solid-state asymmetric microSCs based on flower-like CoVSe/NiCuSe microspheres-coated Cu wire as the positive electrode and polypyrrole/reduced graphene oxide-coated carbon fiber as the negative electrode manifests a maximum energy density of 20.17 mW h cm(-3) at a power density of 624.32 mW cm(-3) and remarkable cycling stability (96.7% after 5000 cycles) with good mechanical stability. As an electrocatalyst for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions in alkaline medium, the CoVSe/NiCuSe electrode delivers an overpotential of 297 mV and 165 mV at 100 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the CoVSe/NiCuSe-based electrolysis cell for overall water splitting presents a low cell voltage (1.7 V at 50 mA cm(-2)) as well as high durability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000813269900001	35723639

For the first time, the spatial location of two semiconductors either in the core or on the shell is precisely designed, and their corresponding photocatalytic performance has been well investigated. For photocatalytic benzyl alcohol oxidation, the activity of QH-COF@TiO(2)is almost three times higher than that of TiO2@QH-COF (reaction rate: 1.19vs.0.44 mmol g(-1)h(-1)), although they exhibit similar capability for light harvesting and charge separation. The higher photocatalytic activity of QH-COF@TiO(2)is due to its easier donation of electrons to O-2. A similar tendency was also observed for the visible-light photocatalytic aerobic cross-dehydrogenative coupling reaction. Our spatial location engineering of semiconductor heterojunctions provides an efficient strategy that facilitates the modulation of charge separation and mass diffusion to enhance the photocatalytic activity of semiconductors.									29	2	0	0	2	0	29			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000572173300017

By using relatively simple algebra, the semiquinone signals can be calculated and fitted to the oscillation pattern by optimizing only two parameters; the electron and quinone equilibrium constants, K-e and K-q, respectively. In this work we expand our earlier model [Tandori et al. (1991) Photosynthetica 25, 159-166] by introducing the inhibitor equilibrium constant, K-i, describing the best fit of the model to the measured oscillation pattern.

We examined the effects of C. vulgaris in the nutrient solution on rice seedlings grown hydroponically in the presence and the absence of 150 mu M CdCl2, using the low (77 K) temperature and pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) chlorophyll fluorescence, P700 photooxidation measurements, photochemical activities of both photosystems, kinetic parameters of oxygen evolution, oxidative stress markers (MDA, H2O2 and proline), pigment content, growth parameters and Cd accumulation. Data revealed that the application C. vulgaris not only stimulates growth and improves the functions of photosynthetic apparatus under physiological conditions, but also reduces the toxic effect of Cd on rice seedlings. Furthermore, the presence of the green microalgae in the nutrient solution of the rice seedlings during Cd exposure, significantly improved the growth, photochemical activities of both photosystems, the kinetic parameters of the oxygen-evolving reactions, pigment content and decreased lipid peroxidation, H2O2 and proline content. Data showed that the alleviation of Cd-induced effects in rice seedlings is a result of the Cd sorption by microalgae, as well as the reduced Cd accumulation in the roots and its translocation from the roots to the shoots.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0031-9457	1851-5657		WOS:000777870000001

Herein, a moderate catalyst is constructed via the in-situ formation of well-defined CoP nanodots on electrochemical exfoliated black phosphorus (EEBP) nanosheets for overall water splitting. The electro-exfoliation process ensures a high-yield (similar to 85%) preparation of BP nanosheets from bulk BP, prompting the large-scale chemosynthesis of CoP/EEBP heterostructures. It is demonstrated that the Co3+/Co2+ and phosphide state ratios can be elegantly tuned in the CoP/EEBP heterostructure to modulate electron donating/accepting characteristics. As for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER), CoP/EEBP heterostructure reveals remarkable electrocatalytic capacity with ultralow overpotentials of only 118 mV and 315 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)) in alkaline media, respectively. Coupled with CoP/EEBP heterostructure for both anode and cathode, the overall water splitting is attested stably with voltage of 1.666 V at eta(10), which is among the best list of BP-based water-splitting electrocatalysts. The basis of the promising electrocatalytic activity is investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results indicate that the CoP-BP interface coupling could be able to benefit the electron-transfer and accelerate the adsorption/dissociation of water. The research provides primary comprehension for the electrocatalytic fulfilment of black phosphorus revisited through valence modulation and interface engineering.									41	1	0	0	4	0	42			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000537401000002

The controllable band structure tuning via coupling low-dimensional materials with enormous potential in semiconductor photocatalysis, notably attractive carbon quantum dots (CQDs) induced for a better utilization of low-energy photoexcitation of promising inherent optical properties and photocatalytic performance on organic pollutant degradation. Here, a CQDs modified ZnO hybrid materials was synthesized and the CQDs preluded carbon-incorporated burger-like ZnO nanoparticles clusters were presented thus demonstrated a specific doping-effect. The dispersity improved by loading halloysite nanotube (HNTs) for efficiently photocatalytic activity enhancement. Furthermore, the band structure, excitation and photocatalytic reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were detected to reveal the photochemical properties and plausible mechanism of CQDs hybrid nanomaterials system. It is observed that the superoxide radical (O-2(center dot-)), and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) are the principal ROS agents under UV-vis excitations. This work not only displays a CQDs modified system of expanding photo-response range to visible light but also throws a way for quantum elemental incorporated on the influence of band-tuning for semiconductor- dominated photocatalysts.

Orvosi hetilap				145	21			1135	40						2004-May-23	2004	In this time-course study the levels of different reactive species, especially those of nitric oxide and peroxynitrite were determined in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat tissues at different time-points after the onset of the disease, before the development of histopathological damages. Significantly higher steady state free radical concentrations were found in the liver 3 weeks after the onset of diabetes, compared to age matched control groups. Increased nitric oxide levels in diabetic vasculature and kidney, and its rapid reaction with reactive oxygen species, resulted in high peroxynitrite generation. This suggested the onset of processes characteristic to premature aging of the endothelium. According to the histopathological results, there were no signs of late complications in the tissues up to seven weeks after induction of diabetes. In conclusion, the authors' experimental evidences support the idea of a complex role for nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species and peroxynitrite in the development of early diabetic tissue injury before the evolution of late complications. This study showed for the first time a time-course dependence for changes in nitric oxide production in diabetic tissues compared to age-matched controls at an early stage of the disease. These results suggest that oxidative stress in increased at a very early stage of diabetes and, in particular, that high levels of nitric oxide and peroxynitrite could play a decisive role in the development of late complications in the diabetic vasculature and kidney.									10	18	0	0	9	0	28			0030-6002			MEDLINE:15206194	15206194

The photo-Fenton process was applied as a pre-treatment, avoiding complete mineralisation, just to obtain a bio-compatible water able to be treated by means of the SBR in a second step. In this sense, different Fenton reagent concentrations were assessed by following dye solution biodegradability enhancement (BOD5/COD), as well as the toxicity (EC50), DOC, colour (AbS(543.5)) and H2O2 evolution with photo-Fenton irradiation time. Obtained pre-treated solutions were biologically oxidized in a SBR containing non-acclimated activated sludge. Different hydraulic retention time (HRT) in the bioreactor were tested to attain the maximum organic load removal efficiency.

Herein, we report the elaborate design of a series of CoFe hydroxide nanosheets on graphene (CFH@G) composites to demonstrate the importance of charge diffusion regulation in improving the OER activity of MHs. It was discovered that the few-layer-thick CFH nanosheets lying on the graphene substrate provided an effective in-plane charge diffusion pathway, while keeping the substrate surface entirely covered by the laid nanosheets is necessary for providing sufficient active sites. The overly thick or stacked nanosheets are not favourable for charge diffusion, especially at large current outputs. By regulating the charge diffusion properties, the best-performing CFH@G-based material can deliver a steady OER current density of 2000 mA cm(-2)at a cost of only 1.507 V under near-industrial conditions (6 M KOH and 60 degrees C). A practical water electrolyzer also demonstrated an impressive current output of 400 mA cm(-2)at 1.694 V as well as a steady solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 17.41%. These findings provide new insights into the role of charge diffusion in water oxidation and may open up an avenue for developing low-cost, stable and efficient electrocatalysts for practical water electrolysis and diverse energy devices.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000542761900007

The process accompanies a phase change and a calcium-manganese oxide (Ca-x(Fe,Mn)(y)O-z) is formed. For CaO/MnFe2O4 mole ratios above 3, a single phase of Ca-3(Fe-2.02/3,Mn-0.98/3)(3)O-7.02 with crystal structure of the A(3)M(3)O(8)-type was formed for the MnFe2O4 sample [Mn(II)/Fe = 1:2]. Associated evolution of H-2 (17.8 cm(3)/g) was observed. The chemical composition of the solid produced shows that the H-2, comes from oxidation of Mn(II) to the Mn(III) ion. In the Mn0.5Fe2.5O4 sample [Mn(II)/Fe = 1:5], the crystal structures of the solid products were assigned to types of Ca-3(Fe,Mn)(3)O-8 and Ca2Fe2O5, the chemical compositions of which could not be determined due to the mixed phase. The H-2, volume (21.6 cm(3)/g) was nearly the same as for an MnFe2O4, sample. Thus, the H-2, evolution reaction for the Mn0.5Fe2.5O4 sample involves oxidation of both Fe(II) and Mn(II) ions in ferrite. H-2, evolution due to oxidation of Mn(II) ions in ferrites was confirmed by the fact that the H-2 volume increased in the order NiFe(2)O(4)much less than Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4 < MnFe2O4. The Mn(II) content also increases in this same order. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.									15	3	0	0	0	0	17			0360-5442			WOS:000076700100008		
J	Thorstenson, DC; Parkhurst, DL								Calculation of individual isotope equilibrium constants for geochemical reactions								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				68	11			2449	2465						JUN 2004	2004	Theory is derived from the work of Urey (Urey H. C. [1947] The thermodynamic properties of isotopic substances. J. Chem. Soc. 562-581) to calculate equilibrium constants commonly used in geochemical equilibrium and reaction-transport models for reactions of individual isotopic species. Urey showed that equilibrium constants of isotope exchange reactions for molecules that contain two or more atoms of the same element in equivalent positions are related to isotope fractionation factors by alpha = (K-ex)(1/n), where n is the number of atoms exchanged. This relation is extended to include species containing multiple isotopes, for example (COO)-C-13-O-16-O-18 and (HHO)-H-1-H-2-O-18. The equilibrium constants of the isotope exchange reactions can be expressed as ratios of individual isotope equilibrium constants for geochemical reactions. Knowledge of the equilibrium constant for the dominant isotopic species can then be used to calculate the individual isotope equilibrium constants.Individual isotope equilibrium constants are calculated for the reaction CO2g = CO2aq for all species that can be formed from C-12, C-13, O-16, and O-18; for the reaction between (ClO2aq)-Cl-12-O-18 and (H2O1)-H-1-O-18; and among the various H-1, H-2, O-16, and O-18 species of H2O. This is a subset of a larger number of equilibrium constants calculated elsewhere (Thorstenson D. C. and Parkhurst D. L. [2002] Calculation of individual isotope equilibrium constants for implementation in geochemical models. Water-Resources Investigation Report 02-4172. U.S. Geological Survey). Activity coefficients, activity-concentration conventions for the isotopic variants of H2O in the solvent H-1(2) O-16(1), and salt effects on isotope fractionation have been included in the derivations. The effects of nonideality are small because of the chemical similarity of different isotopic species of the same molecule or ion. The temperature dependence of the individual isotope equilibrium constants can be calculated from the temperature dependence of the fractionation factors.The derivations can be extended to calculation of individual isotope equilibrium constants for ion pairs and equilibrium constants for isotopic species of other chemical elements. The individual isotope approach calculates the same phase isotopic compositions as existing methods, but also provides concentrations of individual species, which are needed in calculations of mass-dependent effects in transport processes. The equilibrium constants derived in this paper are used to calculate the example of gas-water equilibrium for CO2 in an acidic aqueous solution.

Asymptotic giant branch yields are computed with an updated neutron capture network and updated initial solar abundances. We confirm our previous results obtained with a Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) model: (1) as suggested by the s-process spread observed in disk stars and in presolar meteoritic SiC grains, a weighted average of s-process strengths is needed to reproduce the solar s distribution of isotopes with A > 130; and (2) an additional contribution (of about 25%) is required in order to represent the solar s-process abundances of isotopes from A = 90 to 130. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of different internal structures of the C-13 pocket, which may affect the efficiency of the C-13(alpha, n) O-16 reaction, the major neutron source of the s process. First, keeping the same C-13 profile adopted so far, we modify by a factor of two the mass involved in the pocket; second, we assume a flat C-13 profile in the pocket, and we test again the effects of the variation of the mass of the pocket. We find that GCE s predictions at the epoch of the solar system formation marginally depend on the size and shape of the C-13 pocket once a different weighted range of C-13-pocket strengths is assumed. We obtain that, independently of the internal structure of the 13C pocket, the missing solar system s-process contribution in the range from A = 90 to 130 remains essentially the same.									166	4	0	0	2	0	169			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000335924200010

The catalytic Mn4OxCaYZ center of photosystem II (PSII), after fourfold oxidation, extracts four electrons from two water molecules to yield dioxygen. This reaction cascade has appeared as a single four-electron transfer that occurs in typically 1 ms. Inevitable redox intermediates have so far escaped detection, probably because of very short lifetime. Previous attempts to stabilize intermediates by high O-2-back pressure have revealed controversial results. Here we monitored by membrane-inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS) the production of O-18(2) from O-18-labeled water against a high background of O-16(2) in a suspension of PSII-core complexes. We found neither an inhibition nor an altered pattern of O-2 production by up to 50-fold increased concentration of dissolved O-2. Lack of inhibition is in line with results from previous X-ray absorption and visible-fluorescence experiments, but contradictory to the interpretation of previous UV-absorption data. Because we used essentially identical experimental conditions in MIMS as had been used in the UV work, the contradiction was serious, and we found it was not to be resolved by assuming a significant slowdown of the O-2 release kinetics or a subsequent slow conformational relaxation. This calls for reevaluation of the less direct UV experiments. The direct detection of O-2 release by MIMS shows unequivocally that O-2 release in PSII is highly exothermic. Under the likely assumption that one H+ is released in the S-4 -> S-0 transition, the driving force at pH 6.5 and atmospheric O-2 pressure is at least 220 meV, otherwise 160 meV.									36	0	0	0	23	0	36			0027-8424			WOS:000287844400033	21321223

The observed release of protons is a composite of the chemical production and more indirect reactions such as electrostatically induced shifts of acid/base equilibria of peripheral amino acids. In thylakoids we studied the extent and the rate (at microsecond time resolution) of proton release and uptake by each of the four oxidation steps. The pattern of net proton release in thylakoids varied drastically (between 0.3 and 2 H+/e-) as a function of pH. It differed substantially from the pH-dependent patterns of PSII-enriched membrane fragments and core particles, but the stepped progression toward release of dioxygen (the Kok parameter triple) was about the same. This implied an electrostatic origin of this variation and, with in the observed limits, a lack of (inhibitory) feedback of the uncompensated charge on the electrontransfer from the catalytic Mn cluster to Tyr(z)+. The rate of rapid proton transfer to the amphiphilic, surface-adsorbed indicator neutral red was proportional to its concentration. The shortest half-transfer time was 12 mus, substantially shorter than the time for electron transfer from Mn to Tyr(z)+ at any oxidation step. Rapid deprotonation thus occurred at the level of Tyr(z)+. By rapid deprotonation acts the four light-driven oxidation steps S0 double-line arrow pointing right S1 double-line arrow pointing right S2 double-line arrow pointing right S3 double-line arrow pointing right S4 created between 3.4 (at pH 7.4) and 4.5 (pH 6.3) bases per photosystem II. On the last step there was a compensating slow release of 0.6 proton (pH 7.4) and slow uptake of 0.5 proton (pH 6.3) in milliseconds, respectively. The slow event was attributed to the oxygen-evolving step, S4 --> S0. Our results are in favor of a concerted electron-proton transfer mechanism from water to a manganese-base cluster and are also in favor of one reaction step with water (S4 --> S0) as opposed to two two-electron reactions with a peroxide intermediate formed upon S1 double-line arrow pointing right S2.									117	2	1	0	81	0	119			0006-2960			WOS:A1994MU98800003	8305433

In this study, we investigated the acsl gene structure and physical and chemical characteristics and the evolutionary relationship among acsl genes using the NCBI/Ensembl database. Using hypoxia treatment experiment, acsl gene expression in various organs and its regulation were investigated. A total of 11 acsl genes were identified in rainbow trout. Phylogenetic analyses found that acsl genes in rainbow trout were clustered into two clades: acsl3/4 and acsl1/2/5/6, and the additional gene duplication observed resulted from the third round of genome duplication unique to teleosts. Multiple sequence alignment and conserved motif analyses showed that the sequence of acsl proteins was highly conserved. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) showed that the acsl genes were highly expressed in immune tissues (liver and head kidney). Under hypoxia, the expression of acsl genes was upregulated, suggesting that they enhance the tolerance to hypoxia and are involved in the immune response in rainbow trout. Our study provides valuable insights into teleost evolution and effects of hypoxia on biological immunity and form a basis for further research on the functional characteristics of acsl genes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1096-4959	1879-1107		WOS:000793735600007	35385771

This simplistic view of RBCs as O-2 transporter has changed in recent years as other gases, for example, nitric oxide (NO), and small molecules, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), have been shown to either be produced and/or carried by RBCs to perform other signaling and O-2 sensing functions. In spite of the numerous biochemical and metabolic changes occurring within RBCs during storage, prior to, and after transfusion, perturbations of RBC membrane are likely to affect blood flow in the microcirculation. Subsequent hemolysis due to storage conditions and/or hemolytic disorders may have some pathophysiological consequences as a result of the release of Hb. In this review, we show that evolution has provided a multitude of protection and intervention strategies against free Hb from "cradle'' to "death''; from early biosynthesis to its final degradation and a lot more in between. Furthermore, some of the same naturally occurring protective mechanisms can potentially be employed to oxidatively inactivate this redox active protein and control its damaging side reactions when released outside of the RBC.

B	Vohra, M.								Development and Calibration of Reaction Models for Multilayered Nanocomposites								Development and Calibration of Reaction Models for Multilayered Nanocomposites								144 pp	144 pp						2015	2015	This dissertation focuses on the development and calibration of reaction models for multilayered nanocomposites. The nanocomposites comprise sputter deposited alternating layers of distinct metallic elements. Specifically, we focus on the equimolar Ni-Al and Zr-Al multilayered systems. Computational models are developed to capture the transient reaction phenomena as well as understand the dependence of reaction properties on the microstructure, composition and geometry of the multilayers. Together with the available experimental data, simulations are used to calibrate the models and enhance the accuracy of their predictions. Recent modeling efforts for the Ni-Al system have investigated the nature of self-propagating reactions in the multilayers. Model fidelity was enhanced by incorporating melting effects due to aluminum [Besnoin et al. (2002)]. Salloum and Knio formulated a reduced model to mitigate computational costs associated with multi-dimensional reaction simulations [Salloum and Knio (2010a)]. However, existing formulations relied on a single Arrhenius correlation for diffusivity, estimated for the self-propagating reactions, and cannot be used to quantify mixing rates at lower temperatures within reasonable accuracy [Fritz (2011)]. We thus develop a thermal model for a multilayer stack comprising a reactive Ni-Al bilayer (nanocalorimeter) and exploit temperature evolution measurements to calibrate the diffusion parameters associated with solid state mixing (~720 K - 860 K) in the bilayer. The equimolar Zr-Al multilayered system when reacted aerobically is shown to exhibit slow aerobic oxidation of zirconium (in the intermetallic), sustained for about 2-10 seconds after completion of the formation reaction. In a collaborative effort, we aim to exploit the sustained heat release for bio-agent defeat application. A simplified computational model is developed to capture the extended reaction regime characterized by oxidation of Zr-Al multilayers. Simulations provide insight into the growth phenomenon for the zirconia layer during the oxidation process. It is observed that the growth of zirconia is predominantly governed by surface-reaction. However, once the layer thickens, the growth is controlled by the diffusion of oxygen in zirconia. A computational model is developed for formation reactions in Zr-Al multilayers. We estimate Arrhenius diffusivity correlations for a low temperature mixing regime characterized by homogeneous ignition in the multilayers, and a high temperature mixing regime characterized by self-propagating reactions in the multilayers. Experimental measurements for temperature and reaction velocity are used for this purpose. Diffusivity estimates for the two regimes are first inferred using regression analysis and full posterior distributions are then estimated for the diffusion parameters using Bayesian statistical approaches. A tight bound on posteriors is observed in the ignition regime whereas estimates for the self-propagating regime exhibit large levels of uncertainty. We further discuss a framework for optimal design of experiments to assess and optimize the utility of a set of experimental measurements for application to reaction models.									0	0	0		0	0	0					978-13-215-9811-7	INSPEC:15658288

The hydration properties and binding of the ions to montmorillonite surface and the swelling properties of the mineral specimens were analyzed. Whereas Na+- and Li+-ions were fully hydrated over a large range of conditions, large size K+, NH4+ and mainly Rb+ and Cs+ ions were apt to bind directly to the oxygen atoms on the mineral surface. The forms with large ions exhibited reduced hydration and swelling and the absence of macroscopic swelling of the respective aqueous colloids. The interaction of laser dye rhodamine 6G (R6G) in montmorillonite colloids was investigated by absorption and steady-state fluorescence spectroscopies. Significant effects of the properties of both the inorganic ions and swelling properties of colloidal dispersions on R6G molecular aggregation were observed. Large amounts of the molecular aggregates were formed in the colloids of Na+- and Li+-montmorillonites. The aggregates absorbed light at significantly lower wavelengths (similar to 460 nm) with respect to the light absorption by monomers (535 nm). Fluorescence spectroscopy provided a key evidence for the assignment of the type of the aggregates: The emission of the aggregates at relatively low energies proved these assemblies are rather a mixed H-/J-type than ideal H-aggregates. The presence of parent inorganic cations of larger size led to a significant lowering of the amount of the R6G aggregates in favor of the monomers. Investigations of the evolution of the dye aggregation with time indicated basic features of dye aggregation reaction: The size of parent inorganic ions did not affect the reaction mechanism, but rather limited the extent of the reaction. Probably the forms with large inorganic ions, such as Rb+ and Cs+, did not provide sufficient surface for the formation of the large size assemblies of the dye. This property can be explained in terms of strong association of the large alkali metal ions to clay mineral surface, as well as to reduced swelling in the colloidal systems of respective forms.

The Mn-O-Co composite electrode exhibits high catalytic activity with a low Tafel slope of 123 mV dec(-1) and a low overpotential of 117 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The enhancement in electrocatalytic activity of Mn-O-Co composite electrode is due to the synergistic activity of MnO and CoO with the NiP matrix. The intermetallic interaction among the half-filled orbitals of manganese with the fully occupied orbitals of cobalt and nickel leads to an effective electron delocalization in the catalytic system which enhances the HER performance of the coating. The C-dl value of the composite electrode is in the order of 254 mu F, which is approximately ten fold higher than the bare NiP coating, due to the enhancement in interaction between the Mn-O-Co composite electrode and the reactive species in the HER medium. The Mn-O-Co composite electrode shows promising characteristics as an electrocatalyst with long term stability and remarkable competency with the commercially available electrodes.

J	Semin, Boris K.; Davletshina, Lira N.; Ivanov, Il'ya I.; Rubin, Andrei B.; Seibert, Michael				Semin, Boris/ABF-8153-2021; Davletshina, Lira/ABF-8740-2021				Decoupling of the processes of molecular oxygen synthesis and electron transport in Ca2+-depleted PSII membranes								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				98	1-3			235	249		10.1007/s11120-008-9347-5				OCT 2008	2008	Extraction of Ca2+ from the O-2-evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II (PSII) membranes with 2 M NaCl in the light (PSII(-Ca/NaCl)) results in 90% inhibition of the O-2-evolution reaction. However, electron transfer from the donor to acceptor side of PSII, measured as the reduction of the exogenous acceptor 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP) under continuous light, is inhibited by only 30%. Thus, calcium extraction from the OEC inhibits the synthesis of molecular O-2 but not the oxidation of a substrate we term X, the source of electrons for DCIP reduction. The presence of electron transfer across PSII(-Ca/NaCl) membranes was demonstrated using fluorescence induction kinetics, a method that does not require an artificial acceptor. The calcium chelator, EGTA (5 mM), when added to PSII(-Ca/NaCl) membranes, does not affect the inhibition of O-2 evolution by NaCl but does inhibit DCIP reduction up to 92% (the reason why electron transport in Ca2+-depleted materials has not been noticed before). Another chelator, sodium citrate (citrate/low pH method of calcium extraction), also inhibits both O-2 evolution and DCIP reduction. The role of all buffer components (including bicarbonate and sucrose) as possible sources of electrons for PSII(-Ca/NaCl) membranes was investigated, but only the absence of chloride anions strongly inhibited the rate of DCIP reduction. Substitution of other anions for chloride indicates that Cl-serves its well-known role as an OEC cofactor, but it is not substrate X. Multiple turnover flash experiments have shown a period of four oscillations of the fluorescence yield (both the maximum level, F-max, and the fluorescence level measured 50 s after an actinic flash in the presence of DCMU) in native PSII membranes, reflecting the normal function of the OEC, but the absence of oscillations in PSII(-Ca/NaCl) samples. Thus, PSII(-Ca/NaCl) samples do not evolve O-2 but do transfer electrons from the donor to acceptor sides and exhibit a disrupted S-state cycle. We explain these results as follows. In Ca2+-depleted PSII membranes, obtained without chelators, the oxidation of the OEC stops after the absorption of three quanta of light (from the S1 state), which should convert the native OEC to the S4 state. An one-electron oxidation of the water molecule bound to the Mn cluster then occurs (the second substrate water molecule is absent due to the absence of calcium), and the OEC returns to the S3 state. The appearance of a sub-cycle within the S-state cycle between S3-like and S4-like states supplies electrons (substrate X is postulated to be OH-), explains the absence of O-2 production, and results in the absence of a period of four oscillation of the normal functional parameters, such as the fluorescence yield or the EPR signal from S2. Chloride anions probably keep the redox potential of the Mn cluster low enough for its oxidation by Y-Z(center dot).									14	0	3	0	15	0	19			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000261577900022	18814052

Herein we present a comprehensive study of the interactions of hydrogen on active metal surfaces by using a multiscale method. Six different transition metals of Ni-group and Cu-group are considered. Different from two stable (11 1) and (1 0 0) surfaces, the energetic results of hydrogen species diffusing on and permeating into the active (1 1 0) surfaces are fully addressed from three-dimensional potential energy surfaces and density functional theory calculations. Ab initio thermodynamics calculations show that a stable adsorption phase diagram with full hydrogen coverage preferably forms with decreasing reaction temperature and increasing hydrogen partial pressure, especially on the (1 1 0) surfaces of Ni-group metals without consideration of the reconstruction events. During the evolutions of metal nanoparticles under moderate reaction conditions, the active (1 1 0) surface is difficult to be exposed for Ni-group metal nanoparticles, while for Cu-group metal nanoparticles it is easy to get exposed. These important thermodynamic results will contribute to an in-depth understanding of the interactions between hydrogen species and transition metal catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000618318600007

Laser post-processing of colloidal nanoparticles has been employed previously to create defects in oxide nanoparticles, while the possibility of laser-based cation doping of colloidal nanoparticles without affecting their size remains mostly unaccounted for. Consequently, at the example of doping iron into colloidal Co3O4 spinel nanoparticles, we developed a pulse-by -pulse laser cation doping method to provide a catalyst series with a gradually modified surface composition but maintained extrinsic properties such as phase, size, and surface area for catalytic studies. Laser pulse number-resolved doping series were prepared at a laser intensity chosen to selectively heat the Co3O4-NPs to roughly 1000 K and enable cation diffusion of surface-adsorbed Fe3+ into the Co3O4 lattice. The combination of bulk-sensitive X-ray fluorescence and surface-sensitive X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to confirm the surface enrichment of the Fe-dopant. X-ray diffraction, magnetometry, and Mo''ssbauer spectroscopy revealed an increasing interaction between Fe and the antiferromagnetic Co3O4 with arising number of applied laser pulses, in line with a herein proposed laser-induced surface doping of the colloidal Co3O4 nanoparticles with Fe. Using Fick's second law, the thermal diffusion -related doping depth was estimated to be roughly 2 nm after 4 laser pulses. At the example of gas-phase 2-propanol oxidation and liquid-phase oxygen evolution reaction, the activity of the laser-doped catalysts is in good agreement with previous activity observations on binary iron-cobalt oxides. The catalytic activity was found to linearly increase with the calculated doping depth in both reactions, while only catalysts processed with at least one laser pulse were catalytically stable, highlighting the presented method in providing comparable, active, and stable gradual catalyst doping series for future catalytic studies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000862063600001

Here, a strategy is proposed to adjust the reaction preference of noble metals by tuning the size and local chemical environment of the active sites. This proof-of-concept model is realized by single ruthenium atoms distributed in a matrix of graphitic carbon nitride (Ru SAs/g-C3N4). This model is compared, in terms of the NRR activity, to bulk Ru. The as-synthesized Ru SAs/g-C3N4 exhibits excellent catalytic activity and selectivity with an NH3 yield rate of 23.0 mu g mg(cat)(-1) h(-1) and a Faradaic efficiency as high as 8.3% at a low overpotential (0.05 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode), which is far better than that of the bulk Ru counterpart. Moreover, the Ru SAs/g-C3N4 displays a high stability during five recycling tests and a 12 h potentiostatic test. Density functional theory calculations reveal that compared to bulk Ru surfaces, Ru SAs/g-C3N4 has more facile reaction thermodynamics, and the enhanced NRR performance of Ru SAs/g-C3N4 originates from a tuning of the d-electron energies from that of the bulk to a single-atom, causing an up-shift of the d-band center toward the Fermi level.									121	17	0	0	7	0	124			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000495809600001

In this study, conductive sublayers with different conductivities and morphologies were introduced into anode electrodes in membrane-based water electrolyzers. In-situ and ex-situ investigation results showed that conductive sublayers (Au mesh and carbon nanotube (CNT) film) augmented the sheet conductivity of anode electrodes by up to 4000 times (from 2000 to 0.5 ohm square(-1)), and the ohmic resistance of water electrolyzers was reduced to 1/3 when inserting conductive sublayers. In addition, CNT film provided a higher electrochemical active area than Au mesh, because of favorable morphologies (large porosity and surface area) of CNT fibers on CNT films. Therefore, the current density of water splitting was increased by 3 times (from 4.55 mA cm(-2) to 14.83 mA cm(-2)) at 2.5 V compared to a conventional anode electrode. Visualizations on bubble dynamics showed improved performances with conductive sublayers; this was mainly due to greatly increased number of reaction sites, highly spread reaction area (from 50 to 1000 um), and reduced activation overpotential. Thus, a balance between high electronic conductivity and nanoporous morphology is essential to the anode electrode for larger reaction sites and areas in highly efficient water electrolyzers.									5	1	0	0	2	0	5				2352-152X		WOS:000635497900003

In this work we developed a highly active and stable catalyst containing Co doped earth abundant iron pyrite FeS2 nanosheets hybridized with carbon nanotubes (Fe1-xCoxS2/CNT hybrid catalysts) for HER in acidic solutions. The pyrite phase of Fe1-xCoxS2/CNT was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction and absorption spectroscopy. Electrochemical measurements showed a low overpotential of similar to 0.12 V at 20 mA/cm(2), small Tafel slope of similar to 46 mV/decade, and long-term durability over 40 h of HER operation using bulk quantities of Fe0.9Co0.1S2/CNT hybrid catalysts at high loadings (similar to 7 mg/cm(2)). Density functional theory calculation revealed that the origin of high catalytic activity stemmed from a large reduction of the kinetic energy barrier of H atom adsorption on FeS2 surface upon Co doping in the iron pyrite structure. It is also found that the high HER catalytic activity of Fe0.9Co0.1S2 hinges on the hybridization with CNTs to impart strong heteroatomic interactions between CNT and Fe0.9Co0.1S2. This work produces the most active HER catalyst based on iron pyrite, suggesting a scalable, low cost, and highly efficient catalyst for hydrogen generation.									690	41	0	0	38	0	699			0002-7863			WOS:000349138600034	25588180

Comprehensive microscopic and spectroscopic characterizations confirm the resulting hybrid material possesses a 3D crumpled few-layered graphene network structure decorated with MoS2 nanoparticles. Electrochemical characterization analysis reveals that the resulting hybrid material exhibits efficient electrocatalytic activity toward HER under acidic conditions with a low onset potential of 112 mV and a small Tafel slope of 44 mV per decade. The enhanced mechanism of electrocatalytic activity has been investigated in detail by controlling the elemental composition, electrical conductance and surface morphology of the 3D hybrid as well as Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. This demonstrates that the abundance of exposed active sulfur edge sites in the MoS2 and nitrogen active functional moieties in N-RGO are synergistically responsible for the catalytic activity, whilst the distinguished and coherent interface in MoS2/N-RGO facilitates the electron transfer during electrocatalysis. Our study gives insights into the physical/chemical mechanism of enhanced HER performance in MoS2/N-RGO hybrids and illustrates how to design and construct a 3D hybrid to maximize the catalytic efficiency.									130	4	0	0	11	0	133			2045-2322			WOS:000365851100001	26639026

The mantle peridotites of the AO include spinel lherzolite, harzburgite, and dunite. Harzburgites are dominant over spinel lherzolites in the AO, whereas dunites occur exclusively as 'envelopes' surrounding chromitite pods hosted by harzburgite. Petrographic and geochemical data from the peridotites show a progression from fertile to ultra-refractory character, reflected by a progressive decrease in bulk rock contents of Al2O3, CaO, SiO2, TiO2, Sc, V and Y, modal clinopyroxene, Al2O3 content of pyroxenes, and an increase in mafic phase Mg#s and spinel Cr#s (Cr#: 18.0-39.6% in spinel lherzolites, 33.2-77.8% in harzburgites. and 68.7-72.2% in dunites). The chondrite-normalized REE patterns of the AO spinel lherzolites have LREE depleted signature showing steep slopes from HREE to LREE, and are compatible with the residue of a low degree (8-18%) of partial melting of N type MOR mantle. Their mineral composition, whole-rock chemistry and oxygen fugacities between FMQ - 1.01 and FMQ - 0.57 are consistent with mid-ocean ridge-type mantle. On the other hand, the AO harzburgites have slight enrichment in LREE relative to the patterns expected for residues of partial malting thereby indicating reaction with a LREE-enriched melt. Thus, their chondrite-normalized REE patterns show 'V-shaped' REE distributions similar to those of forearc harzburgites. The AO harzburgites have oxygen fugacities between FMQ - 1.08 and FMQ +0.72. The correlation of spinel Cr# and oxygen fugacity values indicates polygenetic association in the AO harzburgites as encountered in modern forearcs (e.g. lzu-Bonin-Mariana and South Sandwich forearc complexes). The spinel Cr# and oxygen fugacity correlation and the LREE enrichment, despite their ultra-refractory character, confirm the notion that the AO harzburgites could be residue from interaction of a previously melted mantle source (the AO spinel lherzolites) with an ascending LREE-enriched melt in a supra-subduction environment. The interaction must have caused modest melt fractions of the pre-existing mantle lithosphere. Therefore, the harzburgites experienced higher degree partial melting (17 to 25%) than the spinel lherzolites. The AO dunites, the most 'reffactory' of the peridotites, appear to have formed at oxygen fugacities between FMQ +0.72 and FMQ + 1.72, and show V-shaped REE distributions similar to those of supra-subduction zone (SSZ) dunites. Phase equilibria, field evidence and petrographic features show that the AO dunites are formed by dissolution of pyroxene from host harzburgites during the melt-mantle interaction. Focused melt flow caused the highest of melt fractions around the reaction zone. The AO podiform chromitites composed of a very refractory olivine-spinel assemblage (Fo: 94.8 and 96.1 - Cr#: 72.2-81.2%), corroborating a boninitic parentage. Therefore, the chromitites are considered to be the product of boninitic melt evolved by melt-rock interaction in a supra-subduction environment. Our results support a model involving both melt-rock interaction and differential partial melting to explain (a) precipitation of podiform chromitite from boninitic magma and (b) peridotites showing a sequence from MORB-like to subduction-related affinity.

Measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence induction and the maximum quantum yield of O2 evolution were made on individual leaves. Depressions in the ratio of variable to maximal fluorescence (F(v)/F(m)) were correlated with low temperatures and high light levels throughout the winter and during the course of individual days. Depressions in F(v)/F(m) observed in the field during the day were not accompanied by any significant change in the ability of photosystem II complexes to bind 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-dimethyl urea, indicating that the depressions in F(v)/F(m) were not attributable to photodamage to the D1 protein of the photosystem II reaction center. Decreases in F(v)/F(m) were associated with increases in the rate of dissipation of excitation energy by radiationless decay processes and decreases in the quantum efficiency of CO2 assimilation, indicative of a rapidly reversible light-induced "downregulation" of photosynthesis. No major changes were observed in the maximum quantum efficiency of O2 evolution of leaves throughout periods of fluctuating temperature and light, because light-induced depressions in photosynthetic efficiency recovered within the time required to make these measurements.									53	5	0	0	46	1	58			0032-0889			WOS:A1992JX82700021	16653108

We present an original solid-state Li-O-2 cell composed of a Li metal anode, a flexible polymer interlayer, a perovskite-structured Al-doped Li-La-Ti-O (A-LLTO) solid electrolyte, and an integrated cathode in which a porous A-LLTO solid electrolyte frame was covered with a carbon layer and CoO nanoparticles as the catalyst for the cyclic oxygen evolution and reduction reactions. The designed solid-state cell operated safely in pure O-2 atmosphere at temperatures from 25 degrees C to 100 degrees C and delivered the first discharge capacity from 796 mA h g(C+CoO)(-1) to 4035 mA h g(C+CoO)(-1), respectively, at a current density of 0.05 mA cm(-2).

Two snapshots of the cross-section of a spherical flame kernel in homogeneous isotropic turbulence is extracted from a three dimensional direct numerical simulation (DNS) and serve as the initial conditions for a series of subsequent two-dimensional DNS that sample and quantify the impact of chemical kinetic uncertainties on the integrated heat release rates and certain species concentrations. The target configuration features real jet fuel chemistry modeled by a 31-species reduced reaction model. The importance of each reaction is first ranked, by comparing the normalized reaction flux based on a snapshot from the DNS. A two-step process is then taken where initial Monte Carlo screening is performed by perturbing 99 reaction rate constants simultaneously. Following this, a subset of 19 reactions is studied using a larger collection of 2D DNS simulations. As the major quantity of interest, the integrated heat release rate is consistently the most sensitive to reactions R8 (H + O-2 = O + OH) and R32 (CO + OH = CO2 + H). When combined with a consideration of the reaction rate uncertainty, R71 (CH3 + OH = CH2* + H2O) consistently impacts the quality of flame prediction most prominently. For the case starting with a strong burning flame, the rate limiting reactions are found to be not significantly different between the turbulent and laminar conditions, although the magnitudes of sensitivity coefficients are amplified for certain reactions under turbulent conditions due to an enlarged thermochemical space. For the case initialized with a near-extinction flame, more upstream and/or competing reactions with R8 and R32 are observed. Another manifestation of the enlarged thermochemical space in turbulent flames is the wider range of influential reactions for integrated mass of CO, in comparison with the laminar condition where the sensitivity is dominated by R32. For H and C2H2, reactions R71, R42 (HCO + O-2 = CO + HO2) and R40 (HCO + M = CO + H + M) are identified to impact the model predictions for such species as acetylene in the most significant manner.

AE reveals, in this work, three different populations of events during the corrosion of this alloy. The corrosion process was found to proceed via oxygen reduction following a diffusion-controlled mechanism and selective dissolution of alpha,beta'-brass was controlled by the zinc atoms diffusion through oxide film. The diffusion coefficient obtained for zinc in alpha,beta'-brass following Cottrell law is of the order of 9.28 x 10(-12) cm(2)/s. An equivalent circuit modelling the reactions taking place at the electrode/electrolyte interface was suggested. The analysis by X-ray diffraction of residual stresses, before and after corrosion, showed that the dezincification of metal produces two types of residual stresses: macro and microstresses. Their evolution correlates perfectly with the measured acoustic activity. These stresses are then the sources of AE. This shows the important potential of AE in the detection and the control of selective corrosion phenomena. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Polymer films were deposited on a Pt disk electrode by a spin-coating technique. Experiments were performed formed at different rotation rates and potential scan rates. This investigation was undertaken to establish to what extent the solid polymer electrolyte influences the mechanism and kinetics of O-2 reduction. The number of electrons exchanged per O-2 molecule and kinetic parameters for O-2 reduction (reaction order with respect to O-2, Tafel slope/transfer coefficient, and exchange current density) are not changed in the presence of the polymer films, indicating that the reaction path and kinetics are not altered in the presence of recast PBI and Nafion films. The diffusion coefficient (D) and concentration (C) of O-2 in recast films were determined by means of linear sweep voltammetry measurements in quiescent solution. The D and C values in polymer films immersed in acidic solutions were found to have different values than those in the solutions. D(O-2) is about 2.5 times lower in the recast films than in the solutions, whereas C(O-2) is slightly higher in the film. The largest concentration increase, by a factor of two, was found in PBI film in 0.1 M HClO4. Cyclic voltammetric measurements under argon atmosphere have shown that PBI and Nafion recast films are electrochemically stable in the potential range between the onsets of H-2 and O-2 evolution. A decrease in the effective electrocatalyst surface area due to deposition of solid polymer films was 15 to 20%.									198	5	1	0	2	0	207			0013-4651			WOS:A1997XY20000020

Despite the encouraging progress in characterizing surface/interface nanostructures with atomic and orbital precision under ultra-high-vacuum (UHV) conditions, investigating in situ reactions/processes occurring at the surface/interface under operando conditions becomes a crucial challenge in the field of surface catalysis and surface electrochemistry. Promoted by such pressing demands, high-pressure scanning tunneling microscopy (HP-STM) and ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS), for example, have been designed to conduct measurements under operando conditions on the basis of conventional scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and photoemission spectroscopy, which are proving to become powerful techniques to study various heterogeneous catalytic reactions on the surface. This report reviews the development of HP-STM and AP-XPS facilities and the application of HP-STM and AP-XPS on fine investigations of heterogeneous catalytic reactions via evolutions of both surface morphology and electronic structures, including dehydrogenation, CO oxidation on metal-based substrates, and so on. In the end, a perspective is also given regarding the combination of in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and STM towards the identification of the structure-performance relationship.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6				1996-1944		WOS:000502284400031	31703436

Specifically, we examine briefly the early work of the 1960s and 1970s on the photosplitting of free water and water adsorbed on solid supports, based mostly on metal oxides, from which both hydrogen and oxygen evolve in the expected stoichiometric ratio of 2 to 1. The two oil crises of the 1970s (1973 and 1979) spurred the interest of researchers from various disciplines (photochemistry, photo-catalysis and photoelectrochemistry) in search of a Holy Grail photocatalyst, process, or strategy to achieve efficient water splitting so as to provide an energy source alternative to fossil fuels. Some approaches to the photosplitting of water adsorbed on solid insulators (high bandgap materials; Ebg >= 5 eV) and semiconductor photocatalysts (metal oxides) are described from which we deduce that metal oxides with bandgap energies around 5 eV (e.g., ZrO2) are more promising materials to achieve significant water splitting on the basis of quantum yields than narrower bandgap photocatalysts (e.g., TiO2; Ebg approximate to 3.0-3.2 eV), which tend to be relatively inactive by comparison. Although proof of concept of the photosplitting of water has been demonstrated repeatedly in the last four decades, much remains to be done to find the Holy Grail photocatalyst and/or strategy to achieve significant yields of hydrogen.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9				1420-3049		WOS:000392140100032	27916848

From evolutionary and chemical perspectives, however, CO is one of the most essential molecules in the formation of biological components and its interaction with transition metals is at the origin of primordial cell signaling. Not surprisingly, mammals have gradually evolved systems to finely control the synthesis and the sensing of this gaseous molecule. Cells are indeed continuously exposed to small quantities of CO produced endogenously during the degradation of heme by constitutive and inducible heme oxygenase enzymes. We have gradually learnt that heme oxygenase-derived carbon monoxide (CO) serves as a ubiquitous signaling mediator which could be exploited for therapeutic purposes. The development of transition metal carbonyls as prototypic carbon monoxide-releasing molecules (CO-RMs) represents a novel stratagem for a safer delivery of CO-based pharmaceuticals in the treatment of various pathological disorders. This review looks back at evolution to analyze and argue that a dynamic interaction of CO with specific intracellular metal centers is the common denominator for the diversified beneficial effects mediated by this gaseous molecule.									42	1	0	0	27	0	42			1389-4501	1873-5592		WOS:000285185700011	20704543

The control of the impregnation media is crucial to obtain nanocomposites of satisfactory quality, i.e. presenting no segregation of titania particles outside the silica pore structure. Characterization shows that pore size and pore volume decrease linearly with an increase in titania loading, and remain close to the theoretical values calculated assuming the formation of a non-porous coating. Surface area remains unchanged whatever the titania loading (always comprised between 450 and 480 m(2) g(-1)), and micropore volume evolution suggests the formation of nanometric particles within the silica pores. While X-ray diffraction is inefficient to identify the titania phase, Raman spectroscopy showed the formation of anatase particles, with crystal sizes in the nanometric range (<4.5 nm, when stabilized at 400 degrees C). Satisfying thermal stability is obtained on the low titania loading nanocomposites (20 wt% TiO2), with only minor anatase crystal growth up to 800 degrees C. Further characterization by FT-IR of the surface chemical properties of the nanocomposites showed properties similar to that of conventional titania, while improved oxygen mobilities (as evaluated by the O-18/O-16 exchange reaction) are reported on the low titania loading, thermally stable, composites.									25	0	0	0	3	0	25			0959-9428	1364-5501		WOS:000282871600033

However, the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and poor interfacial contact in air cathodes cause unsatisfied performance. Herein, a free-standing Co(3)Fe(7)nanoalloy and Co5.47N encapsulated in 3D nitrogen-doped carbon foam (Co3Fe7@Co5.47N/NCF) is prepared as an additive-free and integrated air cathode for flexible Al-air batteries in both alkaline and neutral electrolytes. The Co3Fe7@Co5.47N/NCF outperforms commercial platinum/carbon (Pt/C) toward ORR with an onset potential of 1.02 V and a positive half-wave potential of 0.92 V in an alkaline electrolyte (0.59 V in sodium chloride solution), which is ascribed to the unique interfacial structure between Co(3)Fe(7)and Co5.47N supported by 3D N-doped carbon foam to facilitate fast electron and mass transfer. The high ORR performance is also supported by in-situ electrochemical Raman spectra and density functional theory calculation. Furthermore, the fabricated Al-air battery displays good flexibility and delivers a power density of 199.6 mW cm(-2), and the binder-free and integrated cathode shows better discharge performance than the traditionally slurry casting cathode. This work demonstrates a facile and efficient approach to develop integrated air cathode for metal-air batteries.									37	0	0	0	2	0	37				2198-3844		WOS:000555440800001	32999831

In this study, the interaction of PG with PSI particle from spinach was investigated by using reconstitution method. The results from the properties of electron transport, fluorescence emission, turbidity, and protein secondary structures in PSI complex incorporated into PG liposomes revealed the existence of PSI-PG interactions. A stimulation and an inhibition of oxygen uptake in PSI particle at a low and higher PG/chlorophyll mass ratio, respectively, were observed. Moreover, an additional enhancement and depression of electron flow in the PSI-PG complexes were occurred in the reaction medium containing CaCl2, at concentrations below and above 5 mM, the aggregation threshold of the reconstituted membranes, respectively. The results demonstrated that the maintenance of the structural optimization was needed for a stimulation of electron transport at a low PG/PSI mass ratio, while a decay of this PSI activity at high PG/PSI ratio was the result of inhibition of the energy transfer from LHCI to PSI reaction center induced by the dissociation of LHCI-680.

The samples were manufactured by the conventional electrochemical anodization. The modification process including thermally oxidized samples in dry oxygen at different temperatures and duration was conducted. After treatment, the products were characterized by Spectral Reflectance in the wavelength range of 200-1100 nm which served to exclude an important decrease of the optical loss with temperature and duration of oxidation. We noticed that thermal oxidation improved the absorption of the UV light and led to a significant decrease of the average reflectivity. The band gap energy was performed by the Photoluminescence spectroscopy under an excitation at 325 nm and showed a broad emission centered at around 2.1 eV for all the samples. Furthermore, thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity were determined by Photothermal Deflection Technique by comparing the experimental curves of normalized amplitude and phase of the photothermal signal to the corresponding theoretical ones. It was also found that the increase of both temperature and time of the thermal oxidation process affect the thermal properties of these layers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The prepared materials form single-phase nanocrystals with rutile structure. Regardless of the chemical composition, the surface of Ru1-xNixO2-delta oxides is Ni-enriched with respect to overall chemical composition. According to both XPS and XANES, the oxidation state of Ru remains +4 in the studied materials. Ni ions are present in both divalent and trivalent states with the fraction of trivalent ions decreasing with increasing Ni content. The refinement of local structure using EXAFS data based on Ru-K and Ni-K edge absorption spectra shows that Ru preserves local arrangement characteristic for ruthenium dioxide. The incorporated Ni shows it tendency to form Clusters within a rutile structure for low Ni concentration. At high Ni content, the architecture of the Ni-rich defects resembles architecture of shear planes in oxygen-deficient rutile. These Ni-rich regions likely manifest themselves on the Surface its line or plane defects, which are the most likely structural features active in the electrocatalytic processes.									34	0	0	0	2	0	35			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000272936400031

The potentiodynamic polarization method and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to determine the corrosion resistance. The polarization results showed very low current densities at the corrosion potential and electrochemical behavior typical of passive metals. At potentials above 0.75 V (SCE), and up to that of the oxygen evolution reaction, the superferritic steel exhibited transpassive behavior followed by secondary passivation. The superferritic stainless steel exhibited high pitting resistance in Hank's solution. This steel did not reveal pits even after polarization to 3000 mV (SCE). The EIS results indicated high impedance values at low frequencies, supporting the results obtained from the polarization measurements. The results obtained for the superferritic steel have been compared with those of the Ti-13Nb-13Zr alloy and an austenitic stainless steel, as Ti alloys are well known for their high corrosion resistance and biocompatibility, and the austenitic stainless steel is widely used as an implant material. The cytotoxicity tests indicated that the superferritic steel, the austenitic steel, and the Ti-13Nb-13Zr alloy were not toxic. Based on corrosion resistance and cytotoxicity results, the superferritic stainless steel can be considered as a potential biomaterial.

Tantalum is a well-known biomaterial which is not affected by body fluids and is not irritating to human tissue. Here we compare the oxidation chemistry crystal structure evolution of tantalum oxide films grown on NiTi by reactive O-2 sputtering and by thermal oxidation of sputter deposited Ta films. The effect of sputtering parameters and post-sputtering treatments on the morphology, oxidation state and crystal structure of the tantalum oxide layer have been investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The study has found that it may be better to avoid oxidation at and above 600 degrees C.

PCC 6803 photosystem II (PS II) under pyrene stress were studied. The results showed there was no significant difference about the oxygen evolution under 0.125 mg/L pyrene stress when compared with control, but it was significantly lower than control at 0.625 mg/L pyrene. Polyphasic chlorophyll-a fluorescence transients in cells of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 exhibited a typical increase including O, J, I, and P phases. Fluorescence yield at phases J, I and P declined slightly at 0.125 and 0.625 mg/L pyrene, and significantly lower than control at 3.125 mg/L. According to the parameters deviated from JIP-test, no modification was induced by pyrene both at the donor side and at the acceptor side of PS II, and the reaction centre of PS II is the primary damaging target. Based on the expressing of four key genes (psbA, psbB, psbC and psbO) of PS II, only psbA showed significant difference at 3.125 mg/L pyrene when compared with control.									13	2	0	0	12	0	13			1001-0742	1878-7320		WOS:000280163800019	21175001

The P proportional to rho(1 + 1/n) polytropes with n = 3 were chosen as the initial models. The equation of state takes into account photon equilibrium radiation, a mixture of Fermi gases of free nucleons and ideal gases of(Fe, He) nuclei in equilibrium relative to nuclear reactions, and an electron-positron gas. The problem includes the transfer equations for electron neutrinos and antineutrinos. We allow for the absorption and emission of neutrinos and antineutrinos which involve free nucleons and nuclei. The solution yielded neutrino light curves. The computed light curves exhibit narrow peaks with characteristic widths of approximate to 10 ms. A constraint on the electron-neutrino mass (less than or similar to 4 eV) can thus be placed when short bursts of radiation are recorded during observations. Part of the energy of neutrino radiation is absorbed by the stellar core envelope: 3.6 x 10(50) and 1.7 x 10(50) erg for the 1.4M(.) and 2M(.) models, respectively. We also compute the collapse of a 2M(.) stellar core with rapid initial rigid rotation with the averaging of the centrifugal force over the solid angle. The formation of a rapidly rotating neutron star in the final state points to the possibility of system fragmentation during the collapse.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1063-7737			WOS:000080697900003		
J	Dau, Holger; Haumann, Michael				MIchael, Haumann/A-7087-2013	Dau, Holger/0000-0001-6482-7494			Eight steps preceding O-O bond formation in oxygenic photo synthesis - A basic reaction cycle of the photosystem II manganese complex								BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-BIOENERGETICS				1767	6			472	483		10.1016/j.bbabio.2007.02.022				JUN 2007	2007	In oxygenic photosynthesis, water is split at a Mn4Ca complex bound to the proteins of photosystem II (PSII). Powered by four quanta of visible light, four electrons and four protons are removed from two water molecules before dioxygen is released. By this process, water becomes an inexhaustible source of the protons and electrons needed for primary biomass formation. On the basis of structural and spectroscopic data, we recently have introduced a basic reaction cycle of water oxidation which extends the classical S-state cycle [B. Kok, B. Forbush, M. McGloin, Cooperation of charges in photosynthetic O2 evolution- I. A linear four-step mechanism, Photochem. Photobiol. 11 (1970) 457-475] by taking into account also the role and sequence of deprotonation events [H. Dart, M. Hartmann, Reaction cycle of photosynthetic water oxidation in plants and cyanobacteria, Science 312 (2006) 1471-1472]. We propose that the outwardly convoluted and irregular events of the classical S-state cycle are governed by a simple underlying principle: protons and electrons are removed strictly alternately from the Mn complex. Starting in I-0, eight successive steps of alternate proton and electron removal lead to I-8 and only then the O-O bond is formed. Thus not only four oxidizing equivalents, but also four bases are accumulated prior to the onset of dioxygen formation. After reviewing the kinetic properties of the individual S-state transition, we show that the proposed basic model explains a large body of experimental results straightforwardly. Furthermore we discuss how the 1-cycle model addresses the redox-potential problem of PSII water oxidation and we propose that the accumulated bases facilitate dioxygen formation by acting as proton acceptors.

Because oxygen shortage leads to a reduction in cellular energy production, all eukaryotes studied so far conserve energy by suppressing their metabolism. However, the molecular physiology of animals that naturally and repeatedly experience anoxia is underexplored. One such animal is the marine nematode Laxus oneistus. It thrives, invariably coated by its sulfur-oxidizing symbiont Candidatus Thiosymbion oneisti, in anoxic sulfidic or hypoxic sand. Here, transcriptomics and proteomics showed that, whether in anoxia or not, L. oneistus mostly expressed genes involved in ubiquitination, energy generation, oxidative stress response, immune response, development, and translation. Importantly, ubiquitination genes were also highly expressed when the nematode was subjected to anoxic sulfidic conditions, together with genes involved in autophagy, detoxification and ribosome biogenesis. We hypothesize that these degradation pathways were induced to recycle damaged cellular components (mitochondria) and misfolded proteins into nutrients. Remarkably, when L. oneistus was subjected to anoxic sulfidic conditions, lectin and mucin genes were also upregulated, potentially to promote the attachment of its thiotrophic symbiont. Furthermore, the nematode appeared to survive oxygen deprivation by using an alternative electron carrier (rhodoquinone) and acceptor (fumarate), to rewire the electron transfer chain. On the other hand, under hypoxia, genes involved in costly processes (e.g., amino acid biosynthesis, development, feeding, mating) were upregulated, together with the worm's Toll-like innate immunity pathway and several immune effectors (e.g., bactericidal/permeability-increasing proteins, fungicides). In conclusion, we hypothesize that, in anoxic sulfidic sand, L. oneistus upregulates degradation processes, rewires the oxidative phosphorylation and reinforces its coat of bacterial sulfur-oxidizers. In upper sand layers, instead, it appears to produce broad-range antimicrobials and to exploit oxygen for biosynthesis and development.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000810841100043	35697683

Their bulk crystalline structures were investigated using X-ray diffractometry (XRD) with the Rietveld analysis. The surface/bulk structure, surface properties, and morphologies were observed using reversed double-beam photoacoustic spectroscopy (RDB-PAS), nitrogen adsorption, and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The results from the XRD revealed that all samples were mainly anatase (ca. 80% or higher) with small amounts of rutile and non-crystalline components. The specific surface areas of all samples were in the range of 115-155 m(2) g(-1). Ce and Cu species were mainly distributed, while Pt was potentially loaded as a partially oxidized form on the titania surface. The results from the RDB-PAS indicated the changing of the energy-resolved distribution of electron traps (ERDT) from the original titania surface upon doping of the metals (Cu, Ce, and Pt), which altered their catalytic activities. The metals photocatalytic activities with UV irradiation were measured in two representative reactions; (a) CO2 evolution from acetic acid under the aerobic condition and (b) H-2 evolution from deaerated aqueous methanol. In reaction (a), the Cu and/or Ce modification gave almost the same or slightly lower activity compared to the non-modified titania samples, while platinum loading yielded ca. 5-6 times higher activity. For reaction (b), the photocatalytic tests were divided into two sets; without (b(1)) and with (b(2)) Pt deposition during the reaction. Similar enhancements of activity from the Pt loading sample (and by Cu modification) were observed in reaction (b(1)) without in-situ platinum deposition, while the unmodified and Ce-doped samples were almost inactive. For the activities of reaction (b(2)) with in-situ platinum deposition, the unmodified samples showed the highest activity while the Cu-modified samples showed significantly lower activity.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2073-4344		WOS:000507336600039

Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) have been used worldwide as common disinfectants and detergents; however, their potential impact on the spread and diffusion of ARGs is still unknown. In this study, we detected the QAC resistance gene (qacE Delta 1), the 1 integron gene (intI1), and 12 ARGs (sul1, sul2, cfr, cml, fexA, tetA, tetG, tetQ, tetX, ermB, bla(TEM,) and dfrA1) in 48 water samples from three watersheds by quantitative PCR (qPCR). We investigated the evolution of bacterial antibiotic resistance under QAC and antibiotic environmental pressures by long-term continuous culture. In addition, five QACs were selected to investigate the effect of QAC on the efficiency of conjugation transfer. The changes in bacterial cell membrane and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by flow cytometry, revealing the mechanism by which QAC affects the spread of antibiotic resistance. Our results showed that the QAC resistance gene was ubiquitous in watersheds and it had significant correlation with intI1 and seven ARGs (r = 0.999, p < 0.01). QACs could increase the resistance of bacteria to multiple antibiotics. Furthermore, all five QACs promoted the conjugation transfer of the RP4 plasmid; the optimal concentration of QACs was about 10(-1)-10(-2) mg/L and their transfer efficiencies were between 1.33 x 10(-6) and 8.87 x 10(-5). QACs enhanced membrane permeability of bacterial cells and stimulated bacteria to produce ROS, which potentially promoted the transfer of plasmids between bacteria. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that QACs may facilitate the evolution and gene transfer of antibiotic resistance gene among microbiome.									27	3	0	0	20	0	29			0944-1344	1614-7499		WOS:000490028900070	31372954

Herein, ultra-small Ru nanoclusters anchored on WNO nanowires covered by few-layer N-doped carbon (named Ru/WNO@C) were synthesized through a simple pyrolysis method. We demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of such cable-like Ru/WNO@C electrocatalysts by combining experimental and computational techniques. The optimal catalyst Ru/WNO@C (Ru wt% = 3.37%) delivers a record-low overpotential of 2 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 33 mV dec(-1), a high mass activity of 4095.6 mA mg(-1) at an overpotential of 50 mV, and long-term durability in 1 M KOH. The superior HER activity of Ru/WNO@C is revealed to be caused by two factors using density functional theory (DFT) calculations: a moderate H adsorption free energy (Delta G(H*) = -0.21 eV) and a rather low water dissociation barrier (Delta G(B) = 0.27 eV). Specifically, Ru/WNO@C (Ru wt% = 3.37%) shows more remarkable HER performance than industrial low carbon steel under a simulated chlor-alkali electrolyte at 90 degrees C, making it an efficient cathode candidate applied in chlor-alkali electrolysis. Finally, a homemade ionic membrane electrolyzer with a Ru/WNO@C (Ru wt% = 3.37%) (-)//RuO2/IrO2-coated Ti-mesh (+) couple presents a low cell voltage of 2.48 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is 320 mV lower than the value for the low carbon steel (-)//RuO2/IrO2-coated Ti-mesh (+) (2.8 V) couple, exhibiting robust stability for 25 h. This work provides a meaningful reference for the design and fabrication of efficient and stable alkaline HER catalysts, and realizes high-efficiency hydrogen production and low-energy consumption chlor-alkali electrolysis at the same time.									85	1	0	0	6	0	85			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000479082800018

The synthesised BiVO4 films, composed as a monolayer of crystallites (diameter <= 1 mu m) fixed on the ITO, realised half-cell solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiencies of over 1.5% by the aid of impregnated CoOx and atomic-layer-deposited NiO when tested as oxygen-evolving photoanodes for water splitting under solar simulator AM 1.5G illumination. Stoichiometric oxygen and hydrogen were generated with Faraday efficiencies of unity over 12 h at 0.6-0.9 V-RHE. This morphology of our bulky semi-transparent BiVO4 films exhibited state-of-the-art solar water splitting performances.									35	1	0	0	3	0	35			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000378716900019

However, the poor corrosion resistance, originating from high chemical activity, limits their applications as electrocatalysts for reactions in acidic and alkaline electrolytes. In this study, it is found that homogeneous amorphous structure can effectively decouple the intertangling catalytic activities and electrochemical stability of transition metal alloys. A noble-metal- free Ni40Fe40P20 metallic glass shows superior catalytic activities and high corrosion resistance, in comparison with the crystallized counterpart and other nanostructured noble-metal-based catalysts, for electrochemical water splitting in both acidic and alkaline solutions.									50	6	0	0	1	0	51			2196-7350			WOS:000401009400005

Herein, novel Z-scheme composite photocatalysts composed of monoclinic or tetragonal BiVO4 (m-BiVO4 or t-BiVO4) nanochains, metallic Bi nanoparticles, and Cu2O nanosheets (Cu2O/Bi/BiVO4) were successfully constructed by using a facile solvothermal method combined with a subsequent hydrothermal process. The characterization results revealed that the crystal phase of BiVO4 and the content of Cu2O and metallic Bi in Cu2(0)O/Bi/BiVO4 can be easily manipulated by tuning the reaction conditions. Photoreduction experiments demonstrated that the Cu2O content and crystal phase of BiVO4 had a great influence on the photocatalytic activity of Cu2O/Bi/BiVO4. The optimized Cu2O/Bi/m-BiVO4 exhibited significantly improved CH4/CO evolution rates of 1.8/8.4 mu mol/(g.h) under visible-light irradiation, being much higher than those of Bi/m-BiVO4[0.32/1.9 mu mol/(g.h)] and Cu2O [0.12/1.0 mu mol/(g.h)]. Moreover, Cu2O/Bi/m-BiVO4 also displayed much higher photocatalytic activity as compared to Cu2O/Bi/t-BiVO4 with a similar Cu2O content. The enhanced photocatalytic performance of Cu2O/Bi/m-BiVO4 was predominantly ascribed to the large surface area, enhanced harvesting capability of visible light, abundant oxygen vacancies, and improved charge separation efficiency as a result of the Z-scheme heterojunctions. In addition, a possible charge-transfer mechanism for Cu-2/Bi/m-BiVO4 with enhanced photocatalytic activity was also proposed.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0888-5885			WOS:000731598500001

Furanic biomass derivatives, such as furfural, are substrates with a number of value-added chemical outlets via partial oxidation, most notably furoic acid (FA), a potential precursor to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Pairing such partial oxidations with H-2 evolution or other reduction reactions (e.g. CO2) in an electrochemical cell presents an opportunity to perform electrolysis at lowered voltages, while coproducing products that are more valuable than O-2. Here, we have utilized differential reactor studies with online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OLEMS), as well as in situ infrared spectroscopy attenuated total reflectance-surface-enhanced infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS), to probe the oxidative reaction pathways of furfural on platinum catalysts in acidic electrolyte. We find furfural electrooxidation selectivity to depend on potential, with the largest shifts corresponding to the transition of Pt to Pt-oxide. Below 1.2 V-RHE, FA and 5-hydroxyfuroic acid are the primary products. At higher potential, selectivity shifts predominantly toward 5-hydroxy-furan-2(5H)-one (HFN), with the appearance of maleic acid (MA) as well. ATR-SEIRAS and OLEMS indicate that decomposition and overoxidation to CO2 occurs via decarbonylated or decarboxylated ring intermediates, while MA is less easily activated toward further oxidation once it is formed. Significant oxidative currents are only achieved at potentials where the surface is cleared of CO, which is derived from spontaneous decarbonylation of furfural on the metallic Pt surface. As potential is increased, selectivity to C-4 and C-5 oxygenates over CO2 is then promoted by a high steady-state surface coverage of organic intermediates that inhibit rapid adsorption and addition of oxygen from the discharge of water. Based on these findings, we propose a reaction pathway and directions for the design of more active and selective electrocatalysts.									42	1	0	0	3	0	43			2155-5435			WOS:000494549700056

This study reports the facile preparation of Au/(PdAg alloy) electrocatalysts with diverse architectures, including nanodumbbells, yolk/shell nanoframes, and yolk/shell nanoboxes, from Au nanorod core/Ag shell bimetallic nanostructures. The fine tuning of the nanostructure architecture is realized by combining galvanic replacement reaction, etching/growth, Ostwald ripening, and coreduction processes. The adding sequence of surfactants and Pd precursors, and the Ag shell thicknesses of the starting core/shell nanocrystals, determine the growth routines and therefore the architectures of the obtained Au/(PdAg alloy) nanostructures. Electrocatalytic performances of all Au/(PdAg alloy) nanostructures toward ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) in alkaline are examined. Compared with the commercial Pd/C electrocatalyst, the nanodumbbells (Au19Pd19Ag62) display 6.3 times higher specific activity and 4.25 times higher mass activity. The nanoframes (Au14Pd14Ag72) are superior as well, with their specific and mass activities 4.4 and 5.5 times higher than those of the Pd/C electrocatalyst, respectively. The nanoboxes also show slight improvement in electrocatalysis. Moreover, the nanodumbbells exhibit greatly improved stability toward EOR in comparison to the Pd/C electrocatalyst. These results can enrich the manufacturing techniques of noble metal nanostructure catalysts and promote their development for fuel cell applications.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0934-0866	1521-4117		WOS:000447556500007

Until now, most attention has been focused on the well-known graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, a growing number of functional materials (more than 5619) with novel optoelectronic and electronic properties are being re-discovered, thereby widening the horizon of 2D libraries. In addition to showing common features of 2DLMs, these new 2D members may bring new opportunities to their well-known analogues, like wider bandgap coverage, direct bandgaps independence with thickness, higher mechanical flexibility, and new photoresponse phenomena. The impressive results communicated so far testify that they have shown high potentials with photodetections covering THz, IR, visible, and UV ranges with comparable or even higher performances than well-known TMDs. Here, we give a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art photodetections of two-dimensional materials beyond graphene and TMDs. The review is organized as follows: fundamentals of photoresponse first are discussed, followed by detailed photodetections of new 2D members including both layered and non-layered ones. After that, photodiodes and hybrid structures based on these new 2D materials are summarized. Then, the integration of these 2D materials with flexible substrates is reviewed. Finally, we conclude with the current research status of this area and offer our perspectives on future developments. We hope that, through reading this manuscript, readers will quickly have a comprehensive view on this research area.									159	25	0	0	0	0	162			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000441712800007	29987307

A noble-metal-free Bi4V2O11/CeO2 hybrid with an amorphous phase (BVC-A) is used as the cathode for electrocatalytic NRR. The amorphous Bi4V2O11 contains significant defects, which play a role as active sites. The CeO2 not only serves as a trigger to induce the amorphous structure, but also establishes band alignment with Bi4V2O11 for rapid interfacial charge transfer. Remarkably, BVC-A shows outstanding electrocatalytic NRR performance with high average yield (NH3: 23.21 mu gh(-1)mg(cat.)(-1), Faradaic efficiency: 10.16%) under ambient conditions, which is superior to the Bi4V2O11/CeO2 hybrid with crystalline phase (BVC-C) counterpart.									447	34	0	0	22	0	449			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000432710100012	29473991

Evaluation of lead anode reactions in acid sulfate electrolytes								Journal of the Electrochemical Society				149	5			A558	69		10.1149/1.1464882				May 2002	2002	Lead alloys containing calcium-tin, silver, or similar combinations are the primary insoluble anodes used for copper and zinc electrowinning. One potential concern with these anodes is the detrimental effect on cathode purity from incorporation of lead corrosion products. Other factors which are important to process economics are the reaction potential and overpotential required for oxygen evolution. In addition to the inherent overpotential, impurities in the electrolyte can have a significant polarization impact, such as the films that may form when manganese is present. In order to gain a better understanding of the fundamental behavior of various concentrations of manganese ions at lead anodes, the polarization behavior of lead calcium-tin and lead-silver alloys in sulfuric acid was evaluated. A common depolarizing agent, Co(II), was also used in some cases to determine possible interactions with manganese. The data show that manganese ions are active on the lead anodes and may precipitate manganese oxide in addition to electrochemical deposition. One possible precipitation mechanism seems to occur by the disproportionation of Mn(III). Co(II) lowers the electrode potential at given current densities which decreases Pb corrosion but favors MnO2 formation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4651			INSPEC:7251192		
J	Lu, Xiao-Ming; Ma, Li-Hua; Wang, Zhong-Hua; Huang, Min-Sheng								Application of Polymerase Chain Reaction-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis to Resolve Taxonomic Diversity in White Rot Fungus Reactors								ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE				27	6			493	503		10.1089/ees.2010.0007				JUN 2010	2010	We analyzed the effect of fungal infection on dye decolorization in continuous and sequential white rot fungus bioreactors. Biological samples of biofilm were collected to determine the ability of these bioreactors to degrade dye in synthetic wastewater. Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to analyze the taxonomy of the fungal community. Decolorization rate and manganese peroxidase activity were analyzed. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the physical structure of the biofilm. At an influent concentration of 50mg/L, decolorization rates and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rates were as high as 88.7% and 53.7% in the sequential reactor and 85.5% and 54.6% in the continuous reactor on day 6 of the studies, respectively. The quantity of foreign fungi in the reactors increased over time and negatively affected Phanerochaete chrysosporium (PC) growth by competitively absorbing nutrients from the culture medium, resulting in a decline in PC-mediated dye decolorization. Changes in manganese peroxidase activity corresponded to dye decolorization rate. Decolorization capacity of the reactor was dependent on multiple factors including operation mode, operating period, and dye concentration, the latter being the most critical. Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis revealed the presence of multiple fungal taxa in some samples. The fungal community was dominated by PC in both reactors. Variations in the makeup of the fungal community corresponded to changes in dye biodegradation. In the sequential reactor, fungal diversity was initially low and progressively increased as treatment progressed, whereas in the continuous reactor the diversity was initially high and then decreased with time. Diversity of foreign fungi was higher in the sequential reactor than in the continuous reactor, suggesting that the latter is more suitable for dye decolorization.									10	0	0	0	7	0	10			1092-8758	1557-9018		WOS:000279112200005

Electmdeposition process was carried out at the deposition potential of -0.46 V (vs. SCE) for 1 h. The phase and composition of the deposited product were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, Field emission scanning electron microscopy, Transmission electron microscopy, EDS mapping, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Electrochemical tests showed that Ni0.26Co0.74Se exhibited the best OER performance among all electrodeposited products. To drive the current density of 50 mA cm(-2), the overpotential of 302 mV was required. After continuously catalyzing the OER for 20 h at the current density of 20 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution, the potential only slightly changed from 1.498 to 1.512 V (vs. RHE). Also, after 20000 cycles the overpotential of the Ni0.26Co0.74Se/NF electrode had no obvious decrease, indicating its excellent cycle stability.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0022-3697	1879-2553		WOS:000586405300010

Polymers have exact and known chemical structure, so they are ideal model materials to study ion beam irradiation induced chemical processes. The type and degree of the degradation strongly depend on the chemical groups attached to the main chain of the polymer. However, how these reactions are affected by the characteristics of the irradiation source such as the type of the particle, its energy and the linear energy transfer is not fully understood yet.The aim of this study was the investigation of the chemical effects of He ion irradiation on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer. In-situ Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS) and elastic recoil detection analysis measurements (ERDA) were performed simultaneously. In this way, the material loss occurring during irradiation could be followed. Infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) was applied to monitor chemical changes. With the in situ RBS-ERDA measurements, completed with FT-IR method, a comprehensive radiation chemical analysis could be achieved on the widely used PMMA polymer. Our results concerning the evolution of the hydrogen, carbon and oxygen contents and the changes in chemical groups indicate that a somewhat different radiation chemical mechanism takes place during 1.6 MeV He irradiation compared to proton irradiation.					23rd International Conference on Ion Beam Analysis (IBA)23rd International Conference on Ion Beam Analysis (IBA)	OCT 08-13, 2017OCT 08-13, 2017	Int Atom Energy Agcy; Shanghai Seeder Publ Acad Sci & Technol; Natl Electrostat Corp; High Voltage Engn Europa B V; KYKY Technol Co; IONTOF; Sky Technol Dev; Pfeiffer VacummInt Atom Energy Agcy; Shanghai Seeder Publ Acad Sci & Technol; Natl Electrostat Corp; High Voltage Engn Europa B V; KYKY Technol Co; IONTOF; Sky Technol Dev; Pfeiffer Vacumm	Fudan Univ, Handan Campus, Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINAFudan Univ, Handan Campus, Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA	13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0168-583X	1872-9584		WOS:000474501400075

Where O-2, NO3-, and Fe/Mn oxyhydroxides become depleted within these microniches or where they exist in zones of sulfate reduction, significant localized peaks in sulfide concentration can occur. These discrete zones of sulfide evolution can cause formation of iron sulfides that would not be predicted by analysis of the 'bulk' sediment. Using a reaction-transport model developed specifically for investigating spherical microniches, and incorporating 3D diffusion, we investigated how the rate constants of organic matter (OM) degradation, particle porosity and niche lifetime, affect dissolved sulfide and iron concentrations, and formation of iron sulfide at such niches. For all of the modelled scenarios the saturation index for iron sulfide is positive, indicating favourable conditions for FeS precipitation in all niches. Those simulations within the microniche lifetime range of 2.5-5 days gave comparable concentration ratios of sulfide to iron in solution within the niche to experimentally observed values. Our model results provide insight into the mechanisms of preservation of OM, including soft tissue, in the paleo record, by predicting conditions that result in preferential deposition of precipitates at the edge of microniches. Decreases in porosity, shorter niche lifetimes and increases in OM degradation rate constants, all tend to increase the likelihood that FeS precipitation will preferentially occur at the edges of a niche, rather than uniformly throughout the niche volume.

J	Kim, HS; Pfaender, FK								Effects of microbially mediated redox conditions on PAH-soil interactions								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				39	23			9189	9196		10.1021/es0508976				DEC 1 2005	2005	The impacts of microbially mediated redox conditions on the bioavailability of persistent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soils and sediments have received little study, despite the fact that most water-saturated soils and sediments spend a significant portion of the time under reduced conditions. To address this need an uncontaminated surface soil was incubated under various redox conditions (aerobic, nitrate-reducing, sulfate-reducing, and methanogenic). Depending on redox conditions, different quantities of fulvic and humic acids were liberated as dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the soil during incubation. The DOM released under highly reduced conditions was more nonpolar, aromatic, and polydisperse, of higher molecular weight, and had a higher sorption capacity for pyrene compared to that obtained from relatively oxic incubations. The soil-phase organic matter incubated under reduced conditions also became relatively more aromatic, containing nonpolar organic molecules of lower oxygen contents and exhibiting higher capacity and more nonlinear and hysteric sorption/desorption behavior for pyrene. These observations support the hypothesis that reduced environments established by indigenous soil microbes alter soil organic matter in a matter similar to diagenetic processes. Such humification-like alteration occurred principally in relatively more labile fractions of soil organic matter. These findings are important for assessing the ultimate fate and exposure risk of hydrophobic organic contaminants in soils and sediments where living microorganisms play a significant role in formation and evolution of soil/sediment organic matter.									31	5	0	0	29	0	35			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000233712700032	16382941

It is a metal that exists in multiple redox states, including the divalent ferrous (Fe2+) and the trivalent ferric (Fe3+) species. The multiple oxidation states of iron make it excellent for electron transfer, allowing iron to be selected during evolution as a cofactor for many proteins involved in central cellular processes including oxygen transport, mitochondrial respiration, and DNA synthesis. However, the redox cycling of ferrous and ferric iron in the presence of H2O2, which is physiologically present in the cells, also leads to the production of free radicals (Fenton reaction) that can attack and damage lipids, proteins, DNA, and other cellular components. To meet the physiological needs of the body, but to prevent cellular damage by iron, the amount of iron in the body must be tightly regulated. Here we review how the liver is the central conductor of systemic iron balance and show that this central role is related to the secretion of a peptide hormone hepcidin by hepatocytes. We then review how the liver receives and integrates the many signals that report the body's iron needs to orchestrate hepcidin production and maintain systemic iron homeostasis.									105	6	1	0	76	1	110			0006-4971	1528-0020		WOS:000329745400011	24200681

It catalyses the formation of reactive oxygen species, mainly hypochlorous acid, contributing to anti-pathogenic defense. Disorders in the production or regulation of MPO may lead to a variety of health conditions, mainly of inflammatory origin, including autoimmune inflammation.We have studied the effect of ionizing radiation on the activity of MPO, as measured by the capacity retained by the enzyme to produce hypochlorous acid as reactive oxygen species after exposure to successive doses of solvated electrons, the strongest possible one-e(-) reducing agent in water. Chlorination activity was still present after a very high irradiation dose, indicating that radiation damage does not take place at the active site, hindered in the core of MPO structure. Decay kinetics show a dependence on the wavelength, supporting that the process must occur at peripheral functional groups situated on external and readily accessible locations of the enzyme.These results are relevant to understand the mechanism of resistance of our innate anti-pathogenic defense system and also to get insight into potential strategies to regulate MPO levels as a therapeutic target in autoimmune diseases.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1011-1344	1873-2682		WOS:000777861700002	34864529

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed the presence of a three-dimensional oxide structure necessary to obtain a fluid-permeable anode. X-ray analysis showed the predominance of the beta-PbO2 phase. The maximum current efficiency for the EOP was 9.5% with an ozone production rate of 1.40 g h(-1). Using a constant ozone production rate of 0.5 g h(-1), the oxidative degradation of paracetamol (PCT) dissolved in water was accomplished as a function of the PCT concentration (20, 30, and 50 mg L-1) and the pH (acid, natural (without adjustment), and alkaline). The UV-Vis spectrophotometric analysis showed that the degradation process is more pronounced in alkaline media with a strong reduction in the electrical energy per order (E-EO). A reduction of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of up to 80% was observed. A linear correlation between data referring to COD and HPLC measurements with the UV absorbance measured at 243 nm (UV243) was verified indicating that these different techniques can be complementary to each other. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study of the ozonation by-products revealed that the oxidation of PCT occurred through the rupture of the aromatic ring. The major part of phenol's ring was oxidized to CO32- while no reaction occurs in the acetamide group of paracetamol during the ozonation reaction.					21st Brazilian Symposium of Electrochemistry and Electroanalysis (SIBEE)21st Brazilian Symposium of Electrochemistry and Electroanalysis (SIBEE)	APR, 2017APR, 2017	Int Soc Electrochemistry; Electrochem Soc; Metrohm Impalla; PWM BrasilInt Soc Electrochemistry; Electrochem Soc; Metrohm Impalla; PWM Brasil	Natal, BRAZILNatal, BRAZIL	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000430301800009

Nonetheless, phase-regulation of NiFe-bimetallic nitrides nanocrystals or nanohybrid architectures confronts challenges and their electrocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) performances are underexplored. Herein, novel pure-phase Ni2+xFe2-xN nanocrystals armored with amorphous N-doped carbon (NC) nanoparticles nanocubes (NPNCs) are obtained by controllable nitridation of NiFe-Prussian-blue analogues derived oxides/NC NPNCs under Ar/NH3 atmosphere. Such Ni2+xFe2-xN/NC NPNCs possess mesoporous structures and show enhanced electrocatalytic activity in 1 m KOH electrolyte with the overpotential of 101 and 270 mV to attain 10 and 50 mA cm(-2) current toward hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, outperforming their counterparts (mixed-phase NiFe2O4/Ni3FeN/NC and NiFe oxides/NC NPNCs). Remarkably, utilizing them as bifunctional catalysts, the assembled Ni2+xFe2-xN/NC||Ni2+xFe2-xN/NC electrolyzer only needs 1.51 V cell voltage for driving OWS to approach 10 mA cm(-2) water-splitting current, exceeding their counterparts and the-state-of-art reported bifunctional catalysts-based devices, and Pt/C||IrO2 couples. Additionally, the Ni2+xFe2-xN/NC||Ni2+xFe2-xN/NC manifests excellent durability for OWS. The findings presented here may spur the development of advanced TMNs nanostructures by combining phase, structure engineering, and hybridization strategies and stimulate their applications toward OWS or other clean energy fields.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000834615700001	35908802

This group of materials offers tunable optoelectronic properties depending on the number of layers and therefore have a wide range of applications. Tungsten disulfide (WS2) is one of such TMDs that has been studied relatively less compared to MoS2. Herein, WSx thin films are grown on several types of substrates by atomic layer deposition (ALD) using a new metal-organic precursor [tris(hexyne) tungsten monocarbonyl, W(CO)(CH3CH2CCCH2CH3)(3)] and H2S molecules at a relatively low temperature of 300 degrees C. The typical self-limiting film growth by varying both, precursor and reactant, is obtained with a relatively high growth per cycle value of similar to 0.13 nm. Perfect growth linearity with negligible incubation period is also evident in this ALD process. While the as-grown films are amorphous with considerable S-deficiency, they can be crystallized as h-WS2 film by post-annealing in the H2S atmosphere above 700 degrees C as observed from x-ray diffractometry analysis. Several other analyses like Raman and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, UV-vis. spectroscopy are performed to find out the physical, optical, and microstructural properties of as-grown and annealed films. The post-annealing in H2S helps to promote the S content in the film significantly as confirmed by the Rutherford backscattering spectrometry. Extremely thin (similar to 4.5 nm), as-grown WSx films with excellent conformality (similar to 100% step coverage) are achieved on the dual trench substrate (minimum width: 15 nm, aspect ratio: 6.3). Finally, the thin films of WSx (as-grown and 600/700 degrees C annealed) on W/Si and carbon cloth substrate are investigated for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The as-grown WSx shows poor performance towards HER and is attributed to the S-deficiency, amorphous character, and oxygen contamination of the WSx film. Annealing the WSx film at 700 degrees C results in the formation of a crystalline layered WS2 phase, which significantly improves the HER performance of the electrode. The study reveals the importance of sulfur content and crystallinity on the HER performance of W-based sulfides.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000593679900001	33108773

However, the kinetics are often limited by the polarization and uncontrollable quality of deposits during the electrodeposition process, which restrict the efficiency and controllability of metal recovery. To ameliorate the limitations of the deposition rate and as-formed deposit quality, transient electrodeposition was introduced to control the microinterfacial reaction by regulating the relationship between charge and mass transfer. The Cu2+ removal efficiency and kinetic coefficient during 1 kHz transient electrodeposition were 17.4 and 17.7% higher than those under the conventional steady electric stimulus, respectively. Based on the combined results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), it was found that the chemical composition of the deposits from transient electrodeposition was more homogenous, as indicated by the low content of metal oxides. The in situ Raman spectra explained the homogenous composition based on the weak interaction of the electrode with the anions during the transient electrodeposition, which was mainly due to the enhanced dehydration under the oscillating or alternating electric field. The potential oscillation induced by the transient electric field also facilitated dehydration, charge transport, and mass transfer, which led to rapid and high-quality metal recovery. Transient electrodeposition will have a great guidance value in the field of metal electroplating and heavy metal recovery from wastewater by electrodeposition.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000721255600040	34709039

Zn- and Sm-doped Au/ceria catalysts were found to be more active than undoped Au/ceria, whereas the addition of lanthanum oxide had the opposite effect. A reductive pretreatment at 373 K for 1 h promoted catalytic activity. The ability of Au/doped ceria catalysts to tolerate the presence Of CO2 and H2O in the feed was also studied. Adding CO2 in the reactant feed provoked a decrease in catalyst activity; however, catalyst doping improved the resistance toward deactivation by CO2. On the other hand, co-addition Of CO2 and H2O counteracted the negative effect Of CO2, especially in the case of doped samples. IR studies of CO adsorbed at 90 K on the catalysts after different pretreatments gave information on the type of gold species present on the catalyst. The dispersion of gold depended on the nature of the dopant. Au/Zn-CeO2 catalyst demonstrated the greatest dispersion as revealed by HRTEM measurements and comparison of FTIR in, tensity of the CO adsorption bands on the reduced samples. AuCex clusters were formed on this catalyst by increasing the prereduction temperature. Large amounts of CO2 were produced during the CO-O-2 interaction in the presence of a high concentration of zero-valent gold sites on the surface of the modified Au catalysts, confirming their important role in the CO oxidation reaction. IR spectra were collected after exposure to CO + O-2 + H-2 and also after addition of water in the PROX reaction mixture over Au/Zn-CeO2 at 400 K. The evolution of the FTIR spectra run at 90 K after admission Of O-2 on preadsorbed CO on the most active catalyst (i.e., Au/Zn-CeO2) demonstrates the roles of the highly dispersed gold and the reduced support in activating oxygen.

J	Laisk, Agu; Eichelmann, Hillar; Oja, Vello; Rasulov, Bakhtier; Ramma, Heikko								Photosystem II cycle and alternative electron flow in leaves								PLANT AND CELL PHYSIOLOGY				47	7			972	983		10.1093/pcp/pcj070				JUL 2006	2006	Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) and tobacco (Nicotiana tabaceum L.) were grown in the laboratory and leaves were taken from field-grown birch trees (Betula pendula Roth). Chlorophyll fluorescence, CO2 uptake and O-2 evolution were measured and electron transport rates were calculated, J(C) from the CO2 uptake rate considering ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylation and oxygenation, J(O) from the O-2 evolution rate, and J(F) from Chl fluorescence parameters. Mesophyll diffusion resistance, r(md), used for the calculation of J(C), was determined such that the in vivo Rubisco kinetic curve with respect to the carboxylation site CO2 concentration became a rectangular hyperbola with K-m(CO2) of 10 mu M at 22.5 degrees C. In sunflower, in the absence of external O-2, J(O) = 1.07J(C) when absorbed photon flux density (PAD) was varied, showing that the O-2-independent components of the alternative electron flow to acceptors other than CO2 made up 7% of J(C). Under saturating light, J(F), however, was 20-30% faster than J(C), and J(F)-J(C) depended little on CO2 and O-2 concentrations. The inter-relationship between J(F)-J(C) and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) was variable, dependent on the CO2 concentration. We conclude that the relatively fast electron flow J(F)-J(C) appearing at light saturation of photosynthesis contains a minor component coupled with proton translocation, serving for nitrite, oxaloacetate and oxygen reduction, and a major component that is mostly cyclic electron transport around PSII. The rate of the PSII cycle is sufficient to release the excess excitation pressure on PSII significantly. Although the O-2-dependent Mehler-type alternative electron flow appeared to be under the detection threshold, its importance is discussed considering the documented enhancement of photosynthesis by oxygen.									37	1	0	0	35	0	38			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:000239430500015	16774929

However, current photocatalytic H-2 production systems still suffer from two basic issues: the kinetic bottleneck for O-2 release and the easy toxicity of the photocatalysts. Here, we developed a consolidated photocatalyst, namely g-C3N3.5(O0.5H0.5), that can boost sustainable and superior H-2 evolution without using any sacrificial reagent. By conceptual design analysis as the guideline for three synthetic steps, the surface hydroxylation structure of g-C3N3.5(O0.5H0.5) concurrently increases the toxicity resistance and maximizes the charge separation for H-2 evolution. The obtained surface-hydroxylated g-C3N3.5(O0.5H0.5) photocatalyst exhibited unassisted high-efficiency pure-water-splitting activity, with a benchmark H-2-evolution rate up to 947.7 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) under visible-light irradiation. Notably, the quantum efficiency of the g-C3N3.5(O0.5H0.5) suspension reached similar to 10.6 and similar to 2.5% at 420 and 520 nm, respectively, 10-20 times that of pristine g-C3N4. For the first time, we observed a key phenomenon that H2O molecules can rapidly capture the photoexcited holes to produce H2O2, which can greatly promote the efficient charge separation for high H-2 evolution.									14	1	0	0	1	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000476913600013
