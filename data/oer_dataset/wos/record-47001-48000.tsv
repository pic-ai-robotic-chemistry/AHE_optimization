In several ligninolytic peroxidases, the site of peroxidative activity is associated with an oxidizable aromatic residue at the protein surface that connects to the buried heme domain through a long-range electron transfer (LRET) pathway. However, the peroxidative activity of these enzymes may also be initiated at the heme access channel. In this study, we examined the origin of the peroxidative activity of UPOs using an evolved secretion variant (PaDa-I mutant) from Agrocybe aegerita as our point of departure. After analyzing potential radical-forming aromatic residues at the PaDa-I surface by QM/MM, independent saturation mutagenesis libraries of Trp24, Tyr47, Tyr79, Tyr151, Tyr265, Tyr281, Tyr293 and Tyr325 were constructed and screened with both peroxidative and peroxygenative substrates. These mutant libraries were mostly inactive, with only a few functional clones detected, none of these showing marked differences in the peroxygenative and peroxidative activities. By contrast, when the flexible Gly314-Gly318 loop that is found at the outer entrance to the heme channel was subjected to combinatorial saturation mutagenesis and computational analysis, mutants with improved kinetics and a shift in the pH activity profile for peroxidative substrates were found, while they retained their kinetic values for peroxygenative substrates. This striking change was accompanied by a 4.5 degrees C enhancement in kinetic thermostability despite the variants carried up to four consecutive mutations. Taken together, our study proves that the origin of the peroxidative activity in UPOs, unlike other ligninolytic peroxidases described to date, is not dependent on a LRET route from oxidizable residues at the protein surface, but rather it seems to be exclusively located at the heme access channel.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			2296-4185			WOS:000704148600001	34595162

In order to overcome this survival challenge, a fine monitoring and controlling of the status of the photosynthetic electron transport chain and the general metabolism is vital for these organisms. Frequently, evolutionary plant adaptation has consisted in the appearance of multigenic families, comprising an array of enzymes, structural components, or sensing, and signaling elements, in numerous occasions with highly conserved primary sequences that sometimes make it difficult to discern between redundancy and specificity among the members of a same family. However, all this gene diversity is aimed to sort environment-derived plant signals to efficiently channel the external incoming information inducing a right physiological answer. Oxygenic photosynthesis is a powerful source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), molecules with a dual oxidative/signaling nature. In response to ROS, one of the most frequent posttranslational modifications occurring in redox signaling proteins is the formation of disulfide bridges (from Cys oxidation). This review is focused on the role of plastid thioredoxins (pTRXs), proteins containing two Cys in their active site and largely known as part of the plant redox-signaling network. Several pTRXs types have been described so far, namely, TRX f, m, x, y, and z. In recent years, improvements in proteomic techniques and the study of loss-of-function mutants have enabled us to grasp the importance of TRXs for the plastid physiology. We will analyze the specific signaling function of each TRX type and discuss about the emerging role in non-photosynthetic plastids of these redox switchers.									72	2	0	0	65	1	73			1664-462X			WOS:000331473300001	24319449

GaN thin films were prepared using a sequential injection of triethyl gallium and N-2/H-2 plasma within the self-limited growth regime, i.e., ALD window at 200 degrees C. The grazing-incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD) analysis reveals that GaN films have a (002) preferential growth direction and the crystalline quality of GaN films was improved with the increase in thickness. GIXRD and atomic force microscopy confirmed the presence of GaN grains, and the grain size increases when the thickness of the GaN layer increases from 5.37 to 48.65 nm. From the x-ray photoelectron spectra, it was shown that the amount of oxygen incorporated in the GaN film decreases as the thickness increases. The spectroscopic ellipsometry analysis reveals that the optical film density and local crystallinity was improved with increasing film thickness to 48.65 nm, but further increase in the film thickness does not seem to improve these features. The optical band edge results suggested that bandgap widening is valid for all HCPA-ALD grown GaN samples. The overall results suggested that GaN films with thicknesses above 48.65 nm have different behavior compared to the thinner GaN films.

Herein, we report, for the first time, an IR-driven strong plasmonic coupling in an unusual metal/non-metal heterostructure system. This system is fabricated through random assemblage of Ag nanorices (NRs) onto W18O49 nanowires (NWs) film with F-doped SnO2 glass as substrate. Through the 3D-finite element simulation, we demonstrate that the plasmonic coupling between Ag NRs and W18O49 NWs significantly enhances the localized electric fields at the "hot spots". This achieved magnitudes of 10(1)-10(4) times of that of incident light, thus leading to the promoted generation of plasmonic "hot-electrons". Moreover, the resonance excitation of plasmonic coupling on the heterostructures not only induces ultrafast electron transfer from W18O49 to Ag hetero-components, but also the photothermal effect to increase the localized temperature. Upon SPR-coupling excitation, the Ag/W18O49 heterostructures film exhibits a remarkable enhancement of the photo/thermal catalytic activity for H-2 evolution from ammonia borane compared to that of either the Ag NRs ((similar to)8.2 x) or W18O49 NWs ((similar to)9.0 x) films. Notably, we observed an obvious H-2 evolution over the Ag/W18O49 heterostructures film under natural sunlight irradiation.									137	8	0	0	15	0	139			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000469906200018

The structure, morphology, and composition of samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS), and nitrogen adsorption-desorption techniques. The results revealed that many tiny needle-like SnO2 nanowires with the average diameter of 5 nm uniformly grew on the surface of the ZnSnO3 hollow micro spheres and the ZnSnO3/SnO2 hollow urchin nanostructures with different SnO2 content also were successfully prepared. In order to comprehend the evolution process of the ZnSnO3/SnO2 hollow urchin 10 wt% ZnSnO3/SnO2 hollow urchin nanostructure exhibited the best gas sensitivity (17.03 for 50 ppm acetone) may be a reliable biomarker for the diabetes patients, which could be ascribed to its large specific surface area, complete pore permeability, and increase of chemisorbed oxygen due to the doping of SnO2.									16	1	0	0	0	0	17			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000418439400001

This was undertaken with a specific view to improve the efficiency of the polysulfide-bromine redox flow battery, for large scale energy storage. Using data from the literature, it is estimated that the catalysts would require exchange current densities of similar to 0.7 to 1 mA cm(-2) true microscopic surface area to enable them to become economically viable. The experiments were performed upon three different forms of WS2: platelet like particles of the 2H polytype of WS2 (2H-WS2), ball milled WS2 and inorganic fullerene-like WS2 (IF-WS2). The catalysts were characterized ex-situ using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis and N-2 gas adsorption methods. Electrochemical measurements were performed at 35 C, in aqueous solutions of 1.8 M Na2S2.47 and 1 M NaOH, simulating the operating conditions of a half-charged polysulfide-bromine redox flow battery.:The catalyst activity increased in the following order: IF-WS2 < 2H-WS2 < ball milled WS2. We attempt to rationalize this trend on the basis of the morphological features observed ex-situ. The ex change current density of the ball milled WS2, at similar to 0.012 mA cm(-2), falls short of the estimated target by a factor of similar to 60 to 70. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

One of the least controlled and understood phenomenon is the oxidation of metals after deposition, at the vacuum break. In this study, the influence of the sample temperature at vacuum break on the oxidation level of TiN deposited by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition is investigated. TiN resistivity appears to be lower for samples which underwent vacuum break at high temperature. Using X-ray photoelectron spectrometry analysis, this change is correlated to the higher oxidation of the TiN layer. Moreover, angle resolved XPS analysis reveals that higher is the temperature at the vacuum break, higher is the surface oxidation of the sample. This surface oxidation is in turn limiting the diffusion of oxygen in the volume of the layer. Additionally, evolution of TiN layers resistivity was monitored in time and it shows that resistivity increases until a plateau is reached after about 10 days, with the lowest temperature at vacuum break resulting in the highest increase, i.e., the resistivity of the sample released to atmosphere at high temperature increased by a factor 1.7 whereas the resistivity of the sample cooled down under vacuum temperature increased by a factor 2.7.

PCC 6803. To test whether additional proteases might be involved in D1 degradation during high rates of photodamage, we have studied the synthesis and degradation of the D1 protein in Delta PsbO and Delta PsbV mutants, in which the CaMn4 cluster catalyzing oxygen evolution is less stable, and in the D1 processing mutants, D1-S345P and Delta CtpA, which are unable to assemble a functional cluster. All four mutants exhibited a dramatically increased rate of D1 degradation in high light compared to the wild-type. Additional inactivation of the ftsH2 gene slowed the rate of D1 degradation dramatically and increased the level of PSII complexes. We conclude that FtsH2 plays a major role in the degradation of both precursor and mature forms of D1 following donor-side photoinhibition. However, this conclusion concerned only D1 assembled into larger complexes containing at least D2 and CP47. In the Delta psbEFLJ deletion mutant blocked at an early stage in PSII assembly, unassembled D1 protein was efficiently degraded in the absence of FtsH2 pointing to the involvement of other protease(s). Significantly, the Delta PsbO mutant displayed unusually low levels of cellular chlorophyll at extremely low-light intensities. The possibilities that PSII repair may limit the availability of chlorophyll for the biogenesis of other chlorophyll-binding proteins and that PsbO might have a regulatory role in PSII repair are discussed.

Lindb. are sucrose and a homologous series of fructans including the trisaccharide 1-kestose. Exogenous glucose and fructose (10 mol m(-3)) did not affect the composition of the soluble carbohydrate pool. Sucrose caused an increase in the fructan pool. Sucrose also inhibited photosynthetic oxygen evolution and respiration. The fructan pool was maintained in preference to sucrose during dark starvation. Low temperature and low water potential increased the fructan pool whereas desiccation increased the proportion of high molecular weight fructan. Acid invertase activity was detected in a taxonomically diverse range of liverworts but was very low or undetectable in a range of mosses. The invertase activity from P. platyphylla was partially purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation. The reaction products of the partially purified enzyme were equimolar glucose and fructose. Kestose and higher DP fructans were not detected suggesting that, at least under the assay conditions used, the enzyme does not have sucrose:sucrose fructosyl transferase activity. The pH optimum was 4.5-5 and the K(m) for sucrose was 1.7 mol m(-3) Pyridoxal hydrochloride (5 mol m(-3)) caused 50 % inhibition. The coexistence of sucrose and invertase suggests that either the invertase is inactive in vivo or is in a different subcellular compartment from sucrose. The pH response shows that it would have very low activity at cytosolic pH. A large acidic vacuole was detected in P. platyphylla leaf cells by neutral-red staining in which either invertase or sucrose could be sequestered. Rehydrating desiccated P. platyphylla for 10 min resulted in a 60 % loss of extractable invertase activity. By contrast, extractable malate dehydrogenase activity increased during rehydration. Rehydrating desiccated leaves caused an increase in glucose and fructose suggesting that the sucrose pool was susceptible to invertase at this time. It is suggested that the partial inactivation of invertase during rehydration minimizes sucrose hydrolysis while membrane structure and subcellular compartmentation are re-established.									29	0	1	0	24	0	31			0028-646X			WOS:000072584200015	33863090

They are expected to transport electrons, heat, and reactants/ products simultaneously with minimum voltage, current, thermal, interfacial, and fluidic losses. In this study, the thin titanium-based LGDLs with straight-through pores and well-defined pore morphologies are comprehensively investigated for the first time. The novel LGDL with a 400 mm pore size and 0.7 porosity achieved a best-ever performance of 1.66 V at 2 A cm(-2) and 80 degrees C, as compared to the published literature. The thin/well-tunable titanium based LGDLs remarkably reduce ohmic and activation losses, and it was found that porosity has a more significant impact on performance than pore size. In addition, an appropriate equivalent electrical circuit model has been established to quantify the effects of pore morphologies. The rapid electrochemical reaction phenomena at the center of the PEMEC are observed by coupling with high-speed and micro-scale visualization systems. The observed reactions contribute reasonable and pioneering data that elucidate the effects of porosity and pore size on the PEMEC performance. This study can be a new guide for future research and development towards high-efficiency and low-cost hydrogen energy.									104	1	0	0	2	0	105			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000395208000014

The modification of the electronic and crystal structure of a material by element doping, morphology design and constructing a complex is a valid strategy for obtaining high-performance catalysts toward overall water splitting. In this study, a novel Cu2-xSe@(Co,Cu)Se-2 core-shell structure with ultrathin (Co,Cu)Se-2 nanosheets anchored as a shell on an internal Cu2-xSe core was fabricated, for the first time, by integrating the three above-mentioned modification methods. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between components and the unique structure, the Cu2-xSe@(Co,Cu)Se-2 core-shell structure can serve as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for both HERs and OERs in neutral-pH electrolytes with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotentials of 106 mV and 396 mV, respectively. Additionally, the material just requires a cell voltage of 1.73 V to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in a neutral two-electrode electrolyzer. Such performances significantly outperform control catalysts and analogues. Even more importantly, the original concept of coordinated regulation presented in this work can broaden our horizons in the design of new and highly efficient catalysts for neutral water splitting.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000610368100056	33399603

From in situ film stress measurements taken during thermal cycles, the best thermal stability was achieved when about half of the thickness at the bottom of the MOCVD-TiN was N-2-H-2 PT. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy revealed that this barrier structure successfully prevented the interdiffusion of the diffusing species from the WSi2 formation at the interface even after thermal annealing at 850 degrees C for 30 min, and this superior thermal stability was due to the microstructural evolution of the diffusion barrier comprising the amorphous layer for the top half and the oxygen-stuffed crystalline layer at the bottom. From the same plasma-treatment condition, the lowest leakage currents were obtained from both n+ and p+ 10 k array chains of the contacts with a diameter of 350 nm and an aspect ratio of similar to 1.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0268-1242	1361-6641		WOS:000295257100011

Compelling evidence indicates that RACK1 can interact with many signal molecules and affect different signal transduction pathways. In this study, a kale (Brassica oleracea var. acephala f. tricolor) RACK1 gene (BoRACK1) was cloned by RT-PCR. The amino acid sequence of BoRACK1 had seven WD repeats in which there were typical GH (glycine-histidine) and WD dipeptides. Comparison with AtRACK1 from Arabidopsis revealed 87.1% identity at the amino acid level. Expression pattern analysis by RT-PCR showed that BoRACK1 was expressed in all analyzed tissues of kale and that its transcription in leaves was down-regulated by salt, abscisic acid, and H2O2 at a high concentration. Overexpression of BoRACK1 in kale led to a reduction in symptoms caused by Peronospora brassicae Gaumann on kale leaves. The expression levels of the pathogenesis related protein genes, PR-1 and PRB-1, increased 2.5-4-fold in transgenic kale, and reactive oxygen species production was more active than in the wild-type. They also exhibited increased tolerance to salt stress in seed germination. H2O2 may also be involved in the regulation of BoRACK1 during seed germination under salt stress. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that the transcript levels of BoRbohs genes were significantly higher in overexpression of BoRACK1 transgenic lines. Yeast two-hybrid assays showed that BoRACK1 could interact with WNK8, eIF6, RAR1, and SGT1. This study and previous work lead us to believe that BoRACK1 may form a complex with regulators of plant salt and disease resistance to coordinate kale reactions to pathogens.									8	1	0	0	6	0	9			0176-1617	1618-1328		WOS:000404884100019	28411489

When it is firstly used as the 3D substrates electrode, the NiCo2S4@Ni3V2O8 material makes use of both components and provides excellent water oxidation activity, 35 mA cm(-2) was achieved at a overpotential of 290 mV, which is better than the benchmark of IrO2 electrodes (320 mV of overpotential at 35 mA cm(-2)) and 13 mA cm(-2) at 1.47 V with excellent durability. The enhanced water oxidation performance of the NiCo2S4@Ni3V2O8 materials is mainly benefiting from its particular core/shell structure, which exhibits big surface areas, and fast electron and ion transfer. Ni3V2O8 shell protects NiCo2S4 core from oxidation in the in alkaline electrolytes and improves stability of NiCo2S4@Ni3V2O8. This indicates that most metal vanadates oxides-based electrodes are promising as an efficient electrocatalyst and shows the advantages of the interfacial effect, which provide a new idea toward high-performance flexible water oxidation fabrication of robust and cheap catalyst sample.

USE - As an electrode for combined photocatalytic and electrochemical remediation for removing organic chemical pollutants, inorganic chemical pollutants and microorganisms (claimed); also used for water purification (e.g. groundwater, tap water) to be drinkable. ADVANTAGE - As the photocatalysts are coated on the titanium substrate, the tedious procedure for separation and recycling of the titanium dioxide (TiO2) suspension in the waste effluents is avoided; an anodic potential bias can be easily applied to the bifunctional electrode, thus effectively suppressing the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes on the photocatalystface; full use of the extra applied energy is provided, as it also drives the electrochemical oxidation on the electrocatalyst; and the anodic potential bias applied to the bifunctional electrode promotes hydroxyl radical formation and oxygen evolution at the electrocatalyst face. This oxygen moves to the surface of the TiO2 catalyst and scavenges the conduction band electrons to form superoxide ions.

However, controllable and efficient synthesis of 2D mesoporous materials and investigation of their intrinsic properties have remained quite rare. Herein, a general and effective surface-limited cooperative assembly (SLCA) method enabled by leveling precursor solutions on KCl crystals via centrifugation is employed to conveniently synthesize two-dimensional (2D) monolayer mesoporous materials with different compositions. This novel strategy is performed in a manner similar to spin coating, not only enabling generation of ultrathin mesostructured composite film on KCl particles and recycling excessive precursor solution but also providing favorable solvent annealing environment for the film to form ordered mesostructures. Taking monolayer mesoporous Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 solid solutions as a sample, they display ultrathin nanosheet morphology with a thickness of similar to 20 nm, highly open porous structure, and easily accessible active sites of surface superoxide species. Upon decoration of 2D mesoporous Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 nanosheets with Pt nanoparticles, the obtained catalyst exhibits superior catalytic activity and stability toward CO oxidation with a low onset temperature of 30 degrees C and a 100% conversion temperature of 95 degrees C, which are 35-70 degrees C lower than those for their counterpart materials, namely, three-dimensional (3D) mesoporous Pt/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2. Moreover, their TOFPt value is similar to 11.3 times higher than that of 3D mesoporous Pt/Ce0.8Zr0.2O2. Characterizations based on various techniques indicate that such an outstanding catalytic performance is due to the ultrashort distance (20 nm) of mass diffusion, highly exposed active sites, rich surface-chemisorbed oxygen, and the synergistic effect between the Ce0.8Zr0.2O2 matrix and Pt species.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000611066000119	33356112	
J	Xirouchakis, D; Draper, DS; Schwandt, CS; Lanzirotti, A					Lanzirotti, Antonio/0000-0002-7597-5924			Crystallization conditions of Los Angeles, a basaltic Martian meteorite								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				66	10			1867	1880	PII S0016-7037(01)00892-4	10.1016/S0016-7037(01)00892-4				MAY 2002	2002	The texture of Los Angeles (stone 1) is dominated by relatively large (0.5-2.0 mm) anhedral to subhedral grains of pyroxene, and generally subhedral to euhedral shocked plagioclase feldspar (maskelynite). Minor phases include subhedral titanomagnetite and ilmenite, Fe-rich olivine, olivine+augite-dominated symplectites [some of which include a Si-rich phase and some which do not], pyrrhotite, phosphate(s), and an impact shock-related alkali- and silica-rich glass closely associated with anhedral to euhedral silica grains. Observations and model calculations indicate that the initial crystallization of Mg-rich pigeonitic pyroxenes at less than or equal to1150 degreesC, probably concomitantly with plagioclase, was followed by pigeonitic and augitic compositions between 1100 and 1050 degreesC whereas between 1050 and 920 to 905 degreesC pyroxene of single composition crystallized. Below 920 to 905 degreesC, single composition Fe-rich clinopyroxene exsolved to augite and pigeonite. Initial appearance of titanomagnetite probably occurred near 990 degreesC and FMQ-1.5 whereas at and below 990 degreesC and greater than or equal toFMQ-1.5 titanomagnetite and single composition Fe-rich clinopyroxene may have started to react, producing ilmenite and olivine. However, judging from the most common titanomagnetite compositions, we infer that most of this reaction likely occurred between 950 and 900 degreesC at FMQ-1.0 +/- 0.2 and nearly simultaneously with pyroxene exsolution, thus producing assemblages of pigeonite, titanomagnetite, olivine, ilmenite, and augite. We deem this reaction as the most plausible explanation for the formation of the olivine+augite-dominated symplectites in Los Angeles. But we cannot preclude possible contributions to the symplectites from the shock-related alkali- and silica-rich glass or shocked plagioclase, and the breakdown of Fe-rich pigeonite compositions to olivine+augite+silica below 900 degreesC. Reactions between Fe-Ti oxides and silicate minerals in Los Angeles and other similar basaltic Martian meteorites can control the T-fO(2) equilibration path during cooling, which may better explain the relative differences in fO(2) among the basaltic Martian meteorites.

A codon-optimized catpo gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The crystal structures of native and recombinant S. thermophilum CATPO and two variants, H82N and V123F, were determined at resolutions of 2.7, 1.4, 1.5 and 1.9 angstrom, respectively. The structure of CATPO reveals a homotetramer with 698 residues per subunit and with strong structural similarity to Penicillium vitale catalase. The haem component is cis-hydroxychlorin -spirolactone, which is rotated 180 degrees with respect to small-subunit catalases. The haem-binding pocket contains two highly conserved water molecules on the distal side. The H82N mutation resulted in conversion of the native d-type haem to a b-type haem. Kinetic studies of the H82N and V123F mutants indicate that both activities are likely to be associated with the haem centre and suggest that the secondary oxidase activity may be a general feature of catalases in the absence of hydrogen peroxide.									9	1	0	0	8	0	10			2059-7983			WOS:000316742700010	23519415

Recent reports suggest that these bacteria are widely distributed in marine plankton, and that they may account for up to 5% of surface ocean photosynthetic electron transport 7 and 11% of the total microbial community(8). Known planktonic anoxygenic phototrophs belong to only a few restricted groups within the Proteobacteria a-subclass. Here we report genomic analyses of the photosynthetic gene content and operon organization in naturally occurring marine bacteria. These photosynthetic gene clusters included some that most closely resembled those of Proteobacteria from the beta-subclass, which have never before been observed in marine environments. Furthermore, these photosynthetic genes were broadly distributed in marine plankton, and actively expressed in neritic bacterioplankton assemblages, indicating that the newly identified phototrophs were photosynthetically competent. Our data demonstrate that planktonic bacterial assemblages are not simply composed of one uniform, widespread class of anoxygenic phototrophs, as previously proposed(8); rather, these assemblages contain multiple, distantly related, photosynthetically active bacterial groups, including some unrelated to known and cultivated types.									317	19	1	0	266	1	339			0028-0836			WOS:000173709100043	11832943

Compared with the dry-mixing method (BC1), the wet-impregnation method (BC2) significantly increased the decomposition rate of chitin pyrolysis and decreased the apparent activation energy from 85 kJ/mol to 76 kJ/ mol. BC2 had a superior catalytic effect on the conversion of heavy components into light fractions. In particular, the selectivities for acetamides and acetonitrile were improved. Furthermore, BC2 enhanced the cleavage of glucosidic, C-O, and C-C bonds, thereby improving the thermolysis of chitin to acetamido acetaldehyde. The production of acetamides, acetonitriles, and other light components (e.g., ketones) was further enhanced via deoxygenation and hydrogenation reactions. Additionally, the selectivity of N-heterocycles (pyridine and pyrrole) and their derivatives (tar-N surrogates) decreased, indicating that tar was significantly reduced during the catalytic pyrolysis and gasification of chitin biomass.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0301-4797	1095-8630		WOS:000797204200004	35489190

However, their large-scale application of noble metals is still challenged by their high expense and scarcity on the earth, as well as the yet insufficient activity to give a satisfying performance. For decades, enormous research efforts have been devoted to the nanoengineering of noble metal nanocrystals, such as the size-, composition-, shape-, and/or morphology-controlled syntheses, and impressive advances have been achieved. Meanwhile, the discovery that the crystal structure of noble metal nanocrystals also has a significant impact on their properties opened a new pathway that modulates the crystal phases of noble metals to achieve better properties. Among the feasible methods for crystal phase transformation, the presence of strain is not negligible. Strain generally has two roles: the driving force of the phase transformation and/or the origin of the distinct properties of the new crystal structure. Strain effect on noble metals has also been extensively studied due to its capability of fine-tuning the surface catalytic activity. Therefore, combining the two hot research trends together, a possible research pathway is emerging. That is, utilizing the potential synergistic effect between novel crystal phases and the subsequent lattice strain to boost the performance of noble metal nanocrystal even further. Herein, a brief summary of the currently discovered noble metal phases and strain effect and the introduction of strain related phase modulation techniques along with the catalytic applications will be presented. Finally, a brief conclusion and future perspective is given. image									22	1	0	0	4	0	22				2567-3165		WOS:000554918100005

As it exhibits a low band gap energy the material may absorb large amounts of natural sunlight. Under visible light irradiation, CZO showed signs of activity towards hydrogen production in the two conditions, which are: i) the condition of photocatalytic reaction with light as the only energy source, in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor and; ii) the photo-electrochemical conditions when the material was deposited onto biased conductive support, in pure water. The improved activity and stability of CZO results from a mutual charge transfer between copper oxide and zinc oxide. Therefore we can suggest that under illumination photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of copper oxide migrate to conduction band of zinc oxide, while holes migrate in the opposite direction, thus improving the charge separation and lowering the rate of unfavourable recombination.

J	Norberg, Nicholas; Harlov, Daniel; Neusser, Gregor; Wirth, Richard; Rhede, Dieter; Morales, Luiz					Morales, Luiz/0000-0002-8352-850X			Experimental development of patch perthite from synthetic cryptoperthite: Microstructural evolution and chemical re-equilibration								AMERICAN MINERALOGIST				98	8-9			1429	1441		10.2138/am.2013.4412				AUG-SEP 2013	2013	In this study, deuteric coarsening of a lamellar cryptoperthite to a patch perthite has been experimentally induced for the first time. An homogeneous alkali feldspar, bulk composition Ab60Or40, was produced by molten salt ion-exchange with a gem quality orthoclase from Madagascar. This was then annealed isothermally for 32 days at 550 degrees C. This resulted in a coherent lamellar cryptoperthite (periodicity 28 nm) probably by spinodal decomposition and subsequent coarsening. The cryptoperthite was then reacted with 20 wt% H2O or 0.1 M HCl at 400 and 500 degrees C at 200, 400, and 1000 MPa for 96 h and for 192 h at 1500 MPa. At 1000 and 1500 MPa and 500 degrees C, the cryptoperthitic crystal fragments were partially replaced by a mosaic of albite and sanidine subgrains in the form of a patch perthite. Other than the Gibb's free energy of reaction as derived from the chemical potentials of the reactant and product phases, the second principle mechanism responsible for driving this reaction is interface-coupled dissolution-reprecipitation driven by a reduction in the coherency strain energy stored within the initial cryptoperthite. The main indicator of this is a change in the microtexture due to the destruction of the coherent lamellar cryptoperthite and its replacement by an assemblage of incoherent subgrains. Detailed mass balancing, based on XRD and EPMA data, indicate that conversion of cryptoperthite to patch perthite is not isochemical. Experimental formation of patch perthite appears to take place in two steps. Between the original cryptoperthite and the patch perthite, TEM investigation identified a "transition zone," characterized by a significant coarsening of the preexisting lamellar microstructure, without any sign of a loss in lattice coherency. This zone is probably the result of hydrous species diffusing into the cryptoperthite causing the H2O-enhanced diffusion of Na and K and hence lamellar coarsening. In the second step, this coarsened microstructure is replaced by the patch perthite. The polycrystalline patch perthite is characterized by a very complex distribution of albite and sanidine sub-grains. Even the larger albite or sanidine patches are polycrystalline. This inevitably results in a three-dimensional network of grain boundaries characterized by high defect densities resulting from the structural misfit between the albite and sanidine sub-grains. An increase in average grain size with distance from the interface indicates that secondary coarsening of the initially, very fine-grained intergrowth occurred. This was driven by the reduction of interface and surface energy similar to the coarsening observed in multiphase ceramics. In addition, the newly formed patch perthite is highly porous despite the fact that the results obtained in this study show that the replacement of cryptoperthite by patch perthite is nearly isovolumetric (Delta V similar to -0.6%). The observed reaction-induced porosity results from differences in relative solubilities between the cryptoperthite and the patch perthite. Porosity abundance has been estimated at approximately 10 to 11 vol% based on the amount of quartz formed during the experiments. Three-dimensionl investigations via FIB serial sectioning indicate almost no interconnectivity between pores. A consequence of albite and sanidine sub-grain coarsening is the constant redistribution of the porosity and the sub-grain boundaries within the patch perthite mosaic over time.This suggests that a dynamically evolving porosity could provide an important transport mechanism for fluid transport through rocks even when the abundance and interconnectivity of the reaction-induced porosity is low.									19	1	0	0	1	0	19			0003-004X	1945-3027		WOS:000323584000007

Nevertheless, large-scale PEC water splitting cells with high performance have not yet been demonstrated, and controllably scaling up high-performance photoelectrodes still remains challenging. Typically, bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has been regarded as one of the most efficient photoanodes for use in PEC water splitting because of its well-suited band structure. However, state-of-the-art PEC performances achieved with BiVO4 photoanodes to date have generally been tested on small scales (<1 cm(2)), due to the nonuniformity of the scaled-up photoactive films, increased resistive losses and inhomogeneous potential distribution in scaled-up substrates, non-linear diffusion of reactants and resultants toward scaled-up photoanodes and so on. Here, a uniform scaled-up precursor (BiOI) film was prepared via a spatial-current-density-distribution-regulated electrodeposition method with a tilt-electrode-configuration. The as-prepared BiOI film was covered with a thin vanadium source layer and then converted to BiVO4 film via a modified thermal-chemical conversion method. The photocurrent density for sulfite oxidation of the 54.32 cm(2) BiVO4 photoanode (similar to 2.55 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE) was the highest value yet reported, and it was comparable with that of the 1.66 cm(2) BiVO4 photoanode (similar to 2.85 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE). To reduce resistive losses and improve the homogeneity of distributed potential in the FTO substrate, metal grids were deposited on the BiVO4 photoanode via thermal evaporation. The maximum fill factor of the photocurrent density curve of the scaled-up BiVO4 photoanode was raised from similar to 29 to similar to 44.5%. After the uniform coating of an oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) layer that was formed by connecting tannin acid molecules with metal ions, the photoanode achieved a photocurrent density of similar to 2.23 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE and similar to 0.83% STH conversion efficiency at 0.65 V-RHE. Finally, the stability test was conducted in a designed test system with water circulation to facilitate diffusion of generated oxygen. The scaled-up OEC/BiVO4 photoanode showed <4% decay after operating under harsh conditions for 5 h.									9	1	0	0	1	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521346600030

Our previous studies confirmed the promotion of these processes by copper-containing metal (CCM) in vitro and in vivo. However, whether and how the coupling of angiogenesis and osteogenesis participates in the promotion of bone regeneration by CCM in vivo is unknown. In this study, M2a macrophages but not M2c macrophages were shown to be immunoregulated by CCM. A CCM, 316L-5Cu, was applied to drilling hole injuries of the tibia of C57/6 mice for comparison. We observed advanced formation of cortical bone and type H vessels beneath the new bone in the 316L-5Cu group 14 and 21 days postinjury. Moreover, the recruitment of CD206-positive M2a macrophages, which are regarded as the primary source of platelet-derived growth factor type BB (PDGF-BB), was significantly promoted at the injury site at days 14 and 21. Under the stimulation of CCM, mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species were also found to be upregulated in CD206(hi) M2a macrophages in vitro, and this upregulation was correlated with the expression of PDGF-BB. In conclusion, our results indicate that CCM promotes the evolution of callus through the generation of type H vessels during the process of bone repair by upregulating the expression of PDGF-BB derived from M2a macrophages.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2296-4185			WOS:000615949700001	33569374

Bi5Ti3CrO15 owns a narrow band gap (E-g similar to 2.46 eV) and shows stable photocatalytic activity under both full range (lambda >= 250 nm) and visible light illumination (lambda >= 420 nm). A short hydrothermal reaction time is critical to achieve high photocatalytic activity as defects such as Cr6+ and Bi5+ can be avoided. An AQE as high as 3.66% at 420 nm +/- 20 nm has been recorded, warranting promising application in the field of solar energy conversions. DFT calculation reveals the important role of Cr(3+)cations for visible light sensitivity of Bi5Ti3CrO15. (C) 2021 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Here, a combined strategy of vacancy engineering and quantum effect via a facile phosphating process is reported, for the first time, to modulate the energy band structure and the interface of ZnxCd1-xS/CoP quantum dots (ZCS(v)/CoP QDs) heterojunction. The combined experimental and theoretical investigation revealed that phosphating process transformed CoOx QDs to CoP QDs, and more importantly, generated considerable amount of sulfur vacancies in ZCS(v). As a result, a Type II ZCS(v)/CoP QDs heterojunction with compatible interfaces was constructed via in-situ generated P-Zn, P-Cd and S-Co bonds, which facilitated the separation and transfer of the photogenerated charge and thus resulted in a high ability towards hydrogen evolution under visible light (17.53 mmol g(-1) h(-1)). This work provides an effective and adaptable strategy to modulate band structure and interfacial compatibility of heterojunctions via vacancy engineering and quantum effect.

Trace elements that are deposited in sediments in response to reducing or sulfidic conditions can provide proxy records for reconstructing dead zone evolution. Based on relative enrichment in reduced vs oxidized marine sediments, Re seems promising as a dead zone proxy. Here, Re is determined by isotope dilution mass spectrometry in sediments underlying the summertime dead zone in Chesapeake Bay. Contrary to expectation, Re becomes only modestly (similar to 2-fold) elevated during the 20th century and fails to track the historic record of summertime O-2 depletion. Rhenium enrichments are watershed-specific and apparently controlled by anthropogenic sources, not by redox-linked authigenic processes. In contrast, Mo enrichments do track historic O-2 depletion. Three factors cause redox control to override anthropogenic control in the case of Mo: relative to weathering fluxes, anthropogenic Mo fluxes are weaker than Re fluxes; during anoxic periods, Mn refluxing amplifies Mo but not Re concentrations near the sediment surface; and high pore water sulfide-polysulfide promotes Mo fixation in pyrite while promoting formation of organo-Re adducts; the latter are too mobile and reactive to preserve a reliable historic record under seasonally fluctuating redox conditions.									20	2	0	0	5	0	22			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000314675500013	23305045

Transferrin has not only the property of lower oxygen tolerance but also the property of anti-diseases. Transferrin is coded by only one gene exceeding 10kb in size and its gene has much repetition structure. The two pairs of primers PI, P4 and P2, P3 were designed and synthesized according to the banding and functional sites of irons while referring to published cDNA or gene sequences of fish transforms in the Database of GenBank. The reaction conditions of PCR are: fore-denaturation, 96℃, 4min; denaturation, 96℃, lmin; annealing, 60℃, lmin; extension, 72℃, 2min; cycle number, 35; last extension, 72℃, 10min. The pGEM-T vector system was used in cloning process. An 866bp length key segment sequence of crucian carp serum transferrin cDNA was cloned. Another two pairs of primers P5, P6 and P7,P8 were designed and synthesized according to the key segment sequence respectively. 5'end (787 bp), 3' end (1081bp) and the full-length cDNA of crucian carp serum transferrin cDNA were cloned by RACE respectively. The full-length cDNA (2444 bp) of crucian carp serum transferrin cDNA was arranged in computer. The deduced protein sequence length is probably 807bp. The homology of cDNA sequences of 14 fish serum transferrins was compared. Their homology is between 30 % and 80 % . The result shows that Cyprinidae fish (such as Carassius auratus, C. gibelio, Cyprinus carpio, and Danio rerio) has very close relative relationship. Their homology is more than 50 % . At the same time, phylogenetic evolution was also analyzed. The evolutional conservatism and amino acid sequence homology of fish serum transferrins were confirmed. DNA Club, DNAman v4.0, DNA Tool v5. 1 and BLAST v2.0 were adopted in the process of nucleotide sequence analysis. The nucleotide sequence analysis offers even more direct evidence for the hypothesis that recent transferrin is from original transferrin banding single iron site, deriving from common ancestor of 5 x 109 year ago and forming many branches of homology transferrins and homology analogs in different animals and different cells or tissues during a long evolutional process. Furthermore, the analogy of transferrin structure and function from different resources are based on the analogy of transferrin genes.			鱼类血清转铁蛋白是鱼类血清中一种非血红素结合铁的beta-球蛋白.从GenBank数据库查询发表的鱼类转铁蛋白cDNA或基因序列,根据铁离子结合及转运功能位点,设计并合成了两对引物P1、P4以及P2、P3,克隆出鲫血清转铁蛋白cDNA中的核心片段,长度为866bp.再根据克隆出的核心片段分别设计上游及下游两对引物P5、P6以及P7、P8,随后用RACE方法分别克隆出鲫血清转铁蛋白cDNA的5'端(787bp)和3'端(1081bp)以及全长cDNA,最后在计算机上排列出鲫血清转铁蛋白全长cDNA,长度为2444bp.比较了14种鱼血清转铁蛋白cDNA序列的同源性,其同源性在30%～80%之间,结果显示鲤科鱼类(鲫、银鲫、鲤及斑马鱼等)具有很近的亲缘关系;同时进行了系统发育进化分析,证实了鱼类血清转铁蛋白进化的保守性和氨基酸序列的高度同源性.						0	0	0		0	0	0			1000-0615			CSCD:1862186		
J	Rabow, LE; Kow, YW								Mechanism of action of base release by Escherichia coli Fpg protein: Role of lysine 155 in catalysis								BIOCHEMISTRY				36	16			5084	5096		10.1021/bi963005a				APR 22 1997	1997	Fpg protein (formamidopyrimidine/8-oxoguanine DNA N-glycosylase) is a DNA repair enzyme that catalyzes the removal of oxidized purines, most notably the mutagenic 7-hydro-8-oxoguanine (8oxoGua) lesion, by an N-glycosylase action. Additionally, Fpg protein catalyzes beta and delta elimination reactions subsequent to removal of the base lesions, as well as the analogous chemistry at abasic sites (AP sites). In this report, we show that of the two lysines that are conserved among the various putative prokaryotic Fpg proteins, a site specific alteration in one of them (lysine 155 changed to alanine) displays meaningful changes in substrate activities. However, lysine 155 is not required for the postulated covalent enzyme-substrate imine intermediate as demonstrated by trapping of the mutant protein-oligonucleotide complexes with cyanide or cyanoborohydride. The K155A mutant shows a decrease in activity with the 8oxoGua-substrate of similar to 50-fold under both k(cat)/K-m and k(cat) conditions. This mutant also displays a similar reduction in activity with an oligonucleotide substrate possessing a single 2'-deoxy-8-oxonebularine site. In contrast, activity for a site specific 7-methylformamidopyrimidine-modified oligonucleotide is reduced similar to 3-4-fold, a much more modest decrease in activity. Interestingly, there is a concomitant increase in AP lyase activity above wild-type for the K155A mutant (1.6-fold increase in k(cat), 32-fold increase in k(cat)/K-m), demonstrating retention of functional beta and delta lyase activities. Together these observations are readily accommodated by a model requiring a direct interaction of lysine 155 with the Cg oxygen of 8-oxopurines. Thus, conservation of this amino acid residue during evolution appears to be essential for specific incision of the mutagenic 8oxoGua base lesion by Fpg protein.									77	0	1	0	62	0	78			0006-2960			WOS:A1997WV34500041	9125531

Clog, Matthieu/0000-0003-3001-8909			Kinetics of CO2(g)-H2O(1) isotopic exchange, including mass 47 isotopologues								CHEMICAL GEOLOGY				395				1	10		10.1016/j.chemgeo.2014.11.023				FEB 24 2015	2015	The analysis of mass 47 isotopologues of CO2 (mainly (COO)-C-13-O-18-O-16) is established as a constraint on sources and sinks of environmental CO2, complementary to delta C-13 and delta O-18 constraints, and forms the basis of the carbonate clumped isotope thermometer. This measurement is commonly reported using the Delta(47) value -a measure of the enrichment of doubly substituted CO2 relative to a stochastic isotopic distribution. Values of Delta 47 for thermodynamically equilibrated CO2 approach 0 (a random distribution) at high temperatures >= several hundred degrees C), and increase with decreasing temperature, to approximate to 0.9% at 25 degrees C. While the thermodynamic properties of doubly substituted isotopologues of CO2 (and, similarly, carbonate species) are relatively well understood, there are few published constraints on their kinetics of isotopic exchange. This issue is relevant to understanding both natural processes (e. g., photosynthesis, respiration, air-sea or air-groundwater exchange, CO2 degassing from aqueous solutions, and possibly gas-sorbate exchange on cold planetary surfaces like Mars), and laboratory handling of CO2 samples for Delta(47) analysis (e. g., re-equilibration in the presence of liquid water, water ice or water adsorbed on glass or metal surfaces). We present the results of an experimental study of the kinetics of isotopic exchange, including changes in Delta(47) value, of CO2 exposed to liquid water between 5 and 37 degrees C. Aliquots of CO2 gas were first heated to reach a nearly random distribution of its isotopologues and then exposed at low pressure for controlled periods of time to large excesses of liquid water in sealed glass containers. Containers were held at 5, 25 and 37 degrees C and durations of exchange ranging from 5 min to 7 days. To avoid the formation of a boundary layer that might slow exchange, the tubes were vigorously shaken during the period of exchange. At the end of each experiment, reaction vessels were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. CO2 gas was then recovered from the head space of the reaction vessel, purified and analyzed for its Delta(47), delta C-13 and delta O-18 by gas source isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Equilibrium was reached for both delta O-18 and Delta(47) after durations of a few hours to tens of hours. delta O-18 values at equilibrium were consistent with known fractionation factors for the CO2-H2O system. The evolution of delta O-18 and Delta(47) with experiment duration were consistent with first-order reactions, with rate constants equal to each other (within error), averaging 0.19 h(-1) at 5 degrees C, 0.38 h(-1) at 25 degrees C and 0.65 h(-1) at 37 degrees C. We calculate an activation energy for this isotopic exchange reaction of 26.2 kJ/mol. By comparison, Mills and Urey (1940) measured the rate of O-18 exchange between CO2(aq) and water to have a rate of 11 h(-1) at 25 degrees C and an activation energy of 71.7 kJ/mol. Our finding of a slower rate and lower activation energy is consistent with the rate limiting step of our experiment being the CO2(g)-CO2(aq) exchange, even when samples are shaken during the partial equilibration.Our results broadly resemble those from the study of (Affek, 2013), though this prior study found a lower rate constant for Delta(47). We propose that the difference is due to analytical uncertainties and explore the theoretical consequences of unequal reaction rates between (COO)-C-12-O-18-O-16 and (COO)-C-13-O-18-O-16 with a forward model.

The typical working mode includes the transfer of photo-induced charges from a semi-conductor to CuO which itself is reduced to Cu2O to initiate the catalytic cycle. In this contribution a photosensitizer (dye), excited by visible light absorption, was used to transfer an electron to the CuO which after reduction catalyzes the water reduction to hydrogen. Several copper(II)-catalysts on high surface silica were prepared by impregnation or precipitation and applied in photocatalytic water reduction. The best catalyst CuO(Cl0.1)/SiO2, synthesized via incipient wetness impregnation of CuCl2 in MCM-41 and a following precipitation with NaOH, achieved a 6 times higher activity (1702 mmol h(-1) g(-1)) compared to a previously investigated copper system (280 mmol h(-1) g(-1) for CuI) under the same reaction conditions. All materials were fully characterized by XRD, TEM and N-2 sorption and further by magnetic resonance and X-ray methods EPR, ASAXS and XAS. In situ measurements evidenced a reduction of the initial Cu(II)-species, which confirms the (proposed) photocatalytic mechanism. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Supernova-Explosion Mechanism Involving Neutrinos								PHYSICS OF ATOMIC NUCLEI				81	1			128	138		10.1134/S106377881801009X				JAN 2018	2018	A major part of the energy released upon the gravitational collapse of massive-star cores is carried away by neutrinos. Neutrinos play a crucial role in collapsing supernovae (SNe). At the present time, mathematical models of core-collapse SNe are based on multidimensional gas dynamics and thermonuclear reactions, whereas the neutrino transport is frequently treated in simplified way. An accurate analysis of neutrinos in a spherically symmetric gravitational collapse is performed on the basis of Boltzmann kinetic equations including all weak-interaction reactions with exact quantum-mechanical matrix elements. The role of multidimensional effects is studied bymeans of multidimensional gas dynamics allowing for the neutrino transport via diffusion treated by employing flux limiters. The possibility of largescale convection, which is of interest both from the point of view of explaining a type II supernova (SN) and from the point of view of implementing an experiment aimed at detecting possible energetic (ae(3)10 MeV) neutrinos from an SN, is discussed. Thermonuclear burning leads to the explosion of a type I SN. A hot central region and the subsequent large-scale convection may also play an important role in the SN mechanism. If neutrinos and convection play a key role for a type II SN, then, in order to explain gamma radiation from product radioactive elements, convection is of importance in the case of SNe belonging to both types. In addition, convection may be important for bright type I SNe. Original methods are presented for multidimensional gas dynamics involving thermonuclear burning and for multitemperature gas dynamics involving radiative transfer.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1063-7788	1562-692X		WOS:000429682300017

Laboratory evidence indicates that lizardite is the more stable at low temperatures, but the difference in their Gibbs free energies is not more than about 2 W in the 300-400degreesC range. Above about 300degreesC, antigorite + brucite is more stable (hall both; in other words, chrysotile is nowhere the most stable.The crystal structures of lizardite and chrysotile give rise to contrasting crystallization behaviors and hence modes of occurrence. The hydration of peridotite at low temperature results in the growth of lizardite from olivine, and (commonly topotactically) from chain and sheet silicates, although the MgO-SiO2-H2O (MSH) phase diagram predicts, antigorite + talc in bastite. The activity of H2O during serpentinization may be buffered to low values by the solids, making the reaction of olivine to lizardite + brucite a stable one. Conservation of oxygen and inheritance of the Fe2+/Mg exchange potential of olivine lead predictably to the precipitation of a highly magnesian lizardite and magnetite, and to the evolution of H-2. Volume expansion is made possible by lizardites force of crystallization, and it is tentatively suggested that this might account for the alpha-serpentine orientation (length normal to (001)) of lizardite pseudofibers in mesh rims and hourglass pseudornorphs after olivine. Whereas mineral replacements commonly conserve volume, in massif serpentinites the diffusive loss of Mg and Si needed for volume conservation during serpentinization requires chemical potential gradients that are unlikely to exist. For small bodies of serpentinite, sheared serpentinite, and systems of large water/rock ratio, volume expansion may be much less.Chrysotile is most Conspicuously developed in tectonically active environments, where associated lithotypes show marginal greensehist-facies parageneses and antigorite tends to make its first appearance. Chrysotile growth is favored in isotropic stress microenvironments of fluid-filled voids and pores (where it may ultimately crystallize pervasively), and in veins, generally after active hydration in the immediate surroundings has ceased. This nevertheless allows the simultaneous growth of lizardite and chrysotile in adjacent partially and fully serpentinized peridotite, respectively, as in the cores and run.,; of kernel structures. Although prominent along shear surfaces, chrysolile growth as slip fiber is promoted by the presence of fluid rather than shear stress. Unlike lizardite, whose growth produces the stress associated with expansion, extreme flattening and shear might be expected to destroy the chrysolile structure. Thus, lizardite and chrysotile behave as though they were a stress-antistress mineral pair.Calorimetric, solubility, and reaction-reversal experiments on chrysotile integrate contributions to its free energy arising from surface properties and, most importantly, from its radius-dependent strain energy. Minimally strained chrysotile (r approximate to 90 Angstrom) may in fact be more stable than lizardite, whereas a maximal-radius chrysotile (r approximate to 200 Angstrom) is not. A model for chrysotile in veins cutting lizardite- or antigorite-bearing rock involves nucleation of low-strain chrysotile followed by kinetically favored crystallization of higher-energy layers driven by mild fluid supersaturation maintained by local potential gradients. It is not clear if this explanation adequately accounts for serrate veins and mass-fiber chrysolile.A revised phase diagram for lizardite and antigorite is offered, and possible stable and metastable reactions among the phases in serpentinites are followed oil all isobaric diagram of reaction free energy (driving force) as a function of temperature.

It was found that an increase in Ar mixing ratio for Cl-2/Ar plasma results in non-monotonic etching rates with the maximums of 160 nm/min at 60 % Ar for Mo and 27 nm/min at 20 % Ar for Al2O3. The addition of O-2 in the Cl-2/Ar plasma causes the non-monotonic Mo etching rate (max. 320 nm/min at 40-45 % O-2) while the Al2O3 etching rate decreases monotonically. The model-based analysis of etching kinetics allows one to relate the non-monotonic etching rates in Cl-2/Ar plasma to the change in the etching regime from the ion-flux-limited mode (at low Ar mixing ratios) to the neutral-flux-limited mode (for high Ar mixing ratios). In the Cl-2/O-2/Ar plasma, the non-monotonic Mo etching rate is probably due to the change in reaction probability.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0272-4324			WOS:000316389700007

The information is contained in the chemical composition, especially the isotopic ratios, of the calcitic shells (e.g., delta(11)B, delta(13)C, delta(18)O). Based on the assumption that our understanding of the major parameters controlling stable isotope incorporation is complete, these geochemical proxies have been used to reconstruct glacial ice volumes, sea surface and deep water temperatures, ocean circulation changes and shifts between carbon reservoirs. However, recent laboratory experiments have demonstrated that the delta(13)C and delta(18)O are not only strongly dependent on the carbonate chemistry of the culture medium but that the sc-called 'vital-effects' are probably mediated via perturbations of the local carbonate system. These findings have an important impact on the interpretation of isotope data. For instance, the carbonate system of the glacial ocean was quite different from that of the Holocene and since the onset of the industrial revolution the carbonate chemistry of the surface water must have changed drastically. As a first step towards a better understanding of the isotopic fractionation processes we present results of a diffusion-reaction model of the carbonate system (CO2, HCO3-, CO32-, H+, OH-, B(OH)(3), B(OH)(4)(-)) in the microenvironment (the diffusive boundary layer) of living planktic foraminifera. The carbon fluxes associated with the main life processes (calcification, respiration and symbiont photosynthesis) lead to substantial perturbations in pH and significant shifts in the concentrations of CO2, CO32- and other components in the vicinity of the foraminifer. Consequently, the carbonate chemistry of the ambient environment is quite different from that of the bulk sea water. Comparison with pH-microelectrode measurements confirm our numerical results. Our results further demonstrate that the symbionts must use bicarbonate as an additional carbon source for photosynthesis as the calculated CO2 fluxes are not sufficient to support measured rates of oxygen evolution. The simulations also show that for the fast calcification of Globigerinoides sacculifer the supply of carbonate ions is insufficient and therefore use of bicarbonate or an internal pool for carbon is required, whereas no such pool is necessary for the much slower calcification in Orbulina universa.

Herein, The NiCoP-10 g-125celcius with threedimensional (3D) nanowire structures grown on nickel foam (NF) was successfully prepared by a novel molten salt method (MSM), serving as an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst. The catalyst only needs minimal overpotential of 159 and 391 mV to gain the large current density of 400 mA cm-2 for HER and OER in 1 M KOH, respectively. Meanwhile, the alkaline electrolyzer assembled by two electrodes requires a cell voltage of 1.83 V to achieve 400 mA cm-2 for OWS and runs stably at 100 mA cm-2 for 100 h without apparent potential decay. Such impressive catalytic performance is mainly attributed to the special molten salt synthesis method which provides a liquid environment with strong ions interaction. This special reaction condition contributes to forming 3D nanowire structures with the advantage of high metal loading, large specific surface area, fast charge transfer, and good mechanical strength. Therefore, this work can offer a new avenue for the synthesis of ultrahigh activity bifunctional electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000780330700005

The viscosity of the solvents plays a key role to the evolution on the morphologies and performances of BiOI samples. The BiOI synthesized in GLY exhibits excellent visible-light photocatalytic performances toward As(III), which is highly increased to that of N-TiO2. Further investigation reveals that the surface characteristics of BiOI nanosheets, the thickness of the nanosheets, and the way by which they integrate together play important roles in photocatalytic reaction process. The main active species is detected as O-center dot(2)-. Considering about the practical use, the BiOI synthesized in GLY is also work under illumination of natural sunlight, and total arsenic concentration can be decreased even below 10 mu g/L from 1 mg/L As(III) aqueous solution within 3 h, which has reached the drinking water standard (0.01 mg/L). Moreover, its stable performance also shows its great potential application value in the wastewater treatment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Samples were exposed to a heat-treatment atmosphere; annealing, oxidation and annealing followed by oxidation in air and N-2-H-2 gas mixtures at 800 degrees C. After the heat treatments, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to characterize the morphology, elemental depth profiles and the chemical states of the elements.In the initial stage of oxidation, the chemistry of the oxide layer on the surface transformed as following sequence: Fe-rich oxide duplex oxide layer (outer Fe-rich and inner Cr-rich) -> Cr-rich mono-phase layer (M2O3). In the transformation, the reaction rate for the formation of Cr-rich oxide layer was controlled by the diffusion of cations. The annealing in H-2-containing atmospheres increased the Cr content at the surface. The increase of hydrogen content in the atmosphere further increased the Cr to Fe ratio in near-surface, and the thickness of the layer affected by the heat treatment. The selective oxidation of chromium occurred as internal Cr2O3 formation, as a function of the Cr content, rather than the oxygen partial pressure. Hydrogen facilitated the diffusion of chromium probably by cleaning of fast diffusion paths. The addition of hydrogen in the annealing atmosphere prior to the oxidation was beneficial to obtain a Cr-rich oxide layer on the surface. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The sulfide melt model is based upon previous parameterization of Fe-Ni-S melts calibrated at 100 kPa, which we have extended to high pressure based on volumetric properties of end-member components. We calculate the behavior of C in the sulfide melt from empirical parameterization of experimental C solubility data. We calculate the continuous compositional evolution of Fe-Ni sulfide liquid and associated effects on carbon storage at pressure and redox conditions corresponding to mantle depths of 60 to 410 km. Equilibrium and mass balance conditions were solved for coexisting Fe-Ni-S melt and silicate minerals (olivine [(Mg,Fe,Ni)(2)SiO4], pyroxene [(Mg,Fe)SiO3]) in a mantle with 200 ppmw S. With increasing depth and decreasing oxygen fugacity ( f(02)), the calculated melt (Fe+Ni)/S atomic ratio increases from 0.8-1.5 in the shallow oxidized mantle to 2.0-10.5 in the reduced deep upper mantle (>8 GPa), with Fe-Ni alloy saturation occurring at >10 GPa. Compared to previous calculations for the reduced deep upper mantle, alloy saturation occurs at greater depth owing to the capacity of sulfide melt to dissolve metal species, thereby attenuating the rise of Fe and Ni metal activities. The corresponding carbon storage capacity in the metal-rich sulfide liquid rises from negligible below 6 GPa to 8-20 ppmw at 9 GPa, and thence increases sharply to 90-110 ppmw at the point of alloy saturation at 10-12 GPa. The combined C storage capacity of liquid and solid alloy reaches 110-170 ppmw at 14 GPa. Thus, in the deep upper mantle, all carbon in depleted sources (10-30 ppmw C) can be stored in the sulfide liquid, and alloy and sulfide liquids host a significant fraction of the C in enriched sources (30-500 ppmw C). Application of these results to the occurrences of inferred metal-rich sulfide melts in the Fe-Ni-S-C system and inclusions in diamonds from the mantle transition zone suggests that oxidization of a reduced metal-rich sulfide melt is an efficient mechanism for deep-mantle diamond precipitation, owing to the strong effect of (Fe+Ni)/S ratio on carbon solubility in Fe-Ni-S melts. This redox reaction likely occurs near the boundary between oxidized subducted slabs and the reduced ambient peridotitic mantle. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Ubiquinone is reduced to ubiquinol and redistributed into lipoproteins, possibly to protect them from oxidation.Aims: To evaluate the impact of oral ubiquinone in diabetic polyneuropathy, and the role of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and nerve growth factor (NGF-beta).Methods: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, patients were randomized to ubiquinone (400 mg) or placebo daily for 12 weeks. Main outcomes were clinical scores, nerve conduction studies, LPO, NGF-beta and safety.Results: Twenty four patients on experimental group and twenty five on control group met the inclusion criteria (mean age 56 years, 22% male and 78% female, mean evolution of type 2 diabetes mellitus 10.7 years). Significant improvement on experimental vs control group was found in neuropathy symptoms score (from 2.5 +/- 0.7 to 1 +/- 0.8, p<0.001), neuropathy impairment score (5.5 +/- 4 to 3.1 +/- 12.6, p<0.001), sural sensory nerve amplitude (13.01 +/- 6.1 to 15.81 +/- 5.1 mu V, p = 0.049), peroneal motor nerve conduction velocity (39.7 +/- 5.0 to 47.8 +/- 4.9 m/s, p = 0.047), and ulnar motor nerve conduction velocity (48.8 +/- 6.8 to 54.5 +/- 6.1 m/s, p = 0.046). There was a significant reduction of LPO in subjects treated with ubiquinone vs placebo (16.7 +/- 8.6 and 23.2 +/- 15.8 nmol/mL, respectively) with p<0.05, and NGF-beta did not change (control 66.5 +/- 26.7 vs. experimental 66.8 +/- 28.4 pg/mL, p = 0.856). No drug-related adverse reactions were reported.Conclusions: Twelve weeks treatment with ubiquinone improves clinical outcomes and nerve conduction parameters of diabetic polyneuropathy; furthermore, it reduces oxidative stress without significant adverse events.

The extremely fast proton transfer (FPT) and "prototropy" tautomerism in the keto-enol (thione-enethiol) systems have been analyzed on the basis of CPMD and PIMD methods level. Comparisons of two-dimensional (2D) free-energy landscapes of reaction coordinate delta-parameter and R-O center dot center dot center dot O or R-O center dot center dot center dot S distances shows that the OH center dot center dot center dot tautomer to be more favorable in the Thiotropolone. The hydrogen between the oxygen and the sulfur atoms adopts a starkly asymmetrical position in the double potential well. The values of the energy barriers for the FPT were calculated and suggested a strong hydrogen bond with low barrier for FPT mechanism. These studies and the 2D average index of pi-delocalization <lambda > landscape of time evolutions of R-O1 center dot center dot center dot O2 and R-C7=O2 or R-C7=S1 distances for the both crystals indicate that hydrogen bonds in the crystals of Tropolone (I) and Thiotropolone (II) have characteristic properties for the type of bonding model resonance-assisted hydrogen bonds and also low-barrier hydrogen bonds. In the crystal of the Thiotropolone (II), we found the hydrogen bond O-H center dot center dot center dot S existing without the equilibrium of the two tautomers whereas in the crystal of the Tropolone (I) has been confirmed the hydrogen bond O-H center dot center dot center dot O existing with the equilibrium of the two tautomers.

J	Lee, JC; Hong, BY; Messier, R; Collins, RW								Real time spectroellipsometry for optimization of diamond film growth by microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition from CO/H-2 mixtures								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS				80	11			6489	6495		10.1063/1.363668				DEC 1 1996	1996	Real time spectroellipsometry has been applied to determine the deposition rate and thickness evolution of the nondiamond (sp(2)-bonded) carbon volume fraction in very thin (<1000 Angstrom), but fully coalesced, nanocrystalline diamond films prepared on Si substrates by microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition from gas mixtures of CO and H-2. At a substrate temperature of similar to 800 degrees C, high quality diamond films can be obtained over two orders of magnitude in the CO/H-2 gas flow ratio, from 0.04, the lowest value explored, to similar to 5. A well-defined minimum in the sp(2) C volume fraction (0.03 in a 600 Angstrom film) is observed for a CO/H-2 ratio of 0.2, corresponding to the C-H-O diamond-growth phase-diagram coordinate X(H/Sigma)=[H]/{[H]+[C]} of 0.9. Under these conditions, the deposition rate increases with increasing temperature over the range of similar to 400-800 degrees C with an activation energy of 8 kcal/mol, behavior identical to that observed for diamond him growth from a CH4/H-2 ratio of 0.01. This observation shows that the dominant film precursors in the diamond growth process from CO/H-2=0.2 are hydrocarbons whose flux at the growing film surface is controlled through the reaction of excited CO with H or H-2 in the plasma. A broad subsidiary minimum in the sp(2) C content is observed, centered near a CO/H-2 ratio of 2, corresponding to an X(H/Sigma) value of similar to 0.5. Under these gas flow conditions, the deposition rate is a complicated function of temperature, exhibiting a peak near 550 degrees C. This peak shifts to lower temperature with further increases in the CO/H-2 ratio above 2, suggesting a nonhydrocarbon precursor and a different growth mechanism for diamond prepared at high CO/H-2 ratio and low temperature.

Specifically, the effect of increasing the initial pH with and without its control during the whole electrolysis experiment is studied on synthetic solutions with concentration values similar to those present in the spent pickling baths. Finally, real SPBs are treated under pH control and the results obtained are also compared with those acquired with the direct electrolysis of these SPBs in a membrane reactor.The modification of the initial pH on synthetic solutions shows an increase in zinc deposition rate as the initial pH is risen. However, the zinc redissolution phenomenon is present during the whole experiment. On the other hand, when the pH is controlled, the results obtained are much better as zinc redissolution is prevented and the hydrogen evolution reaction rate is decreased.Comparing the behaviour between the reactor under pH control and that in the presence of an anion exchange membrane, reflects zinc conversion values slightly higher for the membrane reactor due to the zinc precipitation occurring in the reactor under pH control, which is higher as the pH rises. However, the specific energy consumption is considerably higher in the membrane reactor mainly due to the ohmic drop introduced by the membrane. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Product inhibition and O-18 exchange experiments are consistent with the enzymatic reaction proceeding through two chemical steps, i.e. formation and breakdown of a covalent phosphoenzyme intermediate. The variation of k(cat)/K-m with pH indicates that three ionizable groups are involved in enzyme substrate binding and catalysis. The first group must be deprotonated and is attributed to the second ionization of the substrate. The other two groups with pK(a) values of 5.1 and 5.5 correspond to two enzyme active site residues. The k(cat)-pH profiles for both p-nitrophenyl phosphate and beta-naphthyl phosphate are bell-shaped and are superimposable, with the apparent pK(a) values derived from the acidic limb and the basic limb of the profile being 4.4 and 6.8, respectively. This suggests that the rate-limiting step corresponds to the decomposition of the phosphoenzyme intermediate at all pH values. Results from leaving group dependence of k(cat) at two different pH values support the above conclusion. Furthermore, burst kinetics have been demonstrated with PTP1 using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate. The rate constants for the formation and the breakdown of the intermediate are 241 and 12 s(-1), respectively, at pH 6.0 and 3.5 degrees C. A normal D2O solvent isotope effect (k(cat)(H)/k(cat)(D) = 1.5) is associated with the breakdown of the phosphoenzyme intermediate, indicating a solvent-derived proton in the transition state. The leaving group dependence of k(cat)/K-m suggests that there is a strong electrophilic interaction between the enzyme and the leaving group oxygen in the transition state of the phosphorylation event. These results are compared with those of the Yersinia PTPase and suggest that the mechanism for PTPase-catalyzed phosphate monoester hydrolysis is conserved from bacterial to mammals.									97	0	0	0	87	0	98			0021-9258			WOS:A1995QX86500028	7744751

Although the observation that "nano beats bulk" has been reported for several oxide photocatalysts, very few studies have demonstrated a similar tendency in oxynitrides (including nitrogen-doped oxides) for overall water splitting. Here, we report a rare example of nanosized nitrogen/fluorine-codoped rutile TiO2(nano-TiO2:N,F) as an O-2-evolution photocatalyst in a visible-light-driven Z-scheme water-splitting system in combination with Ru/SrTiO3:Rh and in the presence of redox mediator [Co(bpy)(3)](3+/2+)(bpy = 2,2 '-bipyridine). Utilization of nano-TiO2:N,F improved the activity of the Z-scheme system by a factor of 3-4 compared with bulk-sized TiO2:N,F (bulk-TiO2:N,F). The performance of the optimized nano-TiO2:N,F-based system was twice as high as that of the system constructed with previously reported tantalum/nitrogen-codoped rutile TiO(2)under a cocatalyst-free condition and was comparable to that of a system based on a benchmark BiVO(4)photocatalyst. Physicochemical analyses revealed that the high surface area and high density of reactive electrons in the nano-TiO2:N,F both contributed to its high photocatalytic activity.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000542473000007

Here we demonstrate that NO and peroxynitrite greatly accelerates the mutation of Sendai virus (SeV), a nonsegmented negative-strand RNA virus, by using green fluorescent protein (GFP) inserted into and expressed by a recombinant SeV (GFP-SeV) as an indicator for mutation. GFP-SeV mutation frequencies were much higher in the wild-type mice than in those lacking inducible NO synthase, suggesting that mutation of the virus in vivo is NO dependent. High levels of NO and NO-mediated oxidative stress were induced by GFP-SeV infection in the lung of the wild-type mice, but not in the iNOS-deficient mice, as evidenced by electron spin resonance spectroscopy and immunohistochemical analysis for nitrotyrosine formation as well as histopathological examination. Furthermore, peroxynitrite, an NO-derived reactive nitrogen intermediate, enhanced viral mutation in vitro. These results indicate that the oxidative stress induced by NO produced during the natural course of viral infection increases mutation, expands the quasispecies spectrum, and facilitates evolution of RNA viruses.									80	1	0	0	67	0	82			0892-6638			WOS:000087932200020	10877838

Recently, all kinds of photo-catalysts with excellent performance and stability have been formed. Especially, 2D/2D heterojunction materials have attracted tremendous attention for the faster interfacial charge separation and transfer between them and much active centers. In this work, we designed a series of heterostructure photocatalysts of 2D/2D porous graphitic C3N4 (Pg-C3N4)/CdS-diethylenetriamine (DETA) nanocomposites and explored the S-scheme mechanism via density functional theory (DFT) calculations and XPS analysis. Under visible light irradiation, the experimental results indicated that the designed nanocomposites of water splitting photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution was 9738 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), which is 1.7 and 12.2 times higher than that of CdS-DETA and Pg-C3N4. The performance improvement is mainly due to the following reasons: 1) Pg-C3N4 with large specific surface area could provide more active sites; 2) 2D/2D heterojunction have the faster interfacial charge separation and transfer rate; 3) DETA could synergistically promote the improvement of performance. This work not only introduces a novel Pg-C3N4/CdS-DETA heterojunction but also provides an approach on designing 2D/2D heterojunction for application in photocatalysis. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The heating sources of a single microdischarge (MD) are evaluated by the 1.5D plasma fluid model (PFM) with heating mechanisms including elastic collisions, the ionic Joule heating, and kinetics considered. A 3D gas flow model (GFM) simulating the temperature distribution of the reactor with the convective effect of airflow considered is developed to verify heating sources calculated by comparing the simulated gas temperature with the rotational temperature determined from N-2 emission spectra measured. The source term of the energy equation in the 3D GFM is evaluated from the overall heating source calculated by the 1.5D PFM. The experimental average power consumption of the reactor is obtained and compiled statistically as 3.4 W. The average number of MDs in one cycle is compiled statistically as 140 MDs; therefore the average power consumption of a single MD obtained is around 0.024 W. The simulated power consumption of a single MD is around 0.028 W which agrees the average measured power consumption of a single MD. The heating sources of different mechanisms are evaluated by the 1.5D PFM and are provided as the average volumetric source term to the 3D GFM for evaluating the temperature distribution in the reactor. The simulated result shows that around 45% of power consumption is converted to thermal energy. The simulated average gas temperature at the center of the reactive zone is 460 K which agrees the rotational temperature determined as 470 K. Besides, both the simulated highest temperature and the temperature distribution of the reactor surface are close to those measured by the IR thermometer. The analysis of heating source finds that the ionic Joule heating and kinetics contribute to most of the heating source as 47% and 52%, respectively. Among the ionic species considered, O-2(+) the essential role and contributes to around 66% of the ionic Joule heating. Among the kinetics considered, exothermic processes contribute to most of the heating source as around 88%. Further analysis shows that the ozone generation and destruction reactions contribute to remarkable heating sources. The quenching processes of excited atomic oxygen and nitrogen species also contribute to noticeable heating sources and result in fast evolution of species densities. The N-2(v) and O-2(v) contribute to only a small percentage (similar to 10%) of the kinetic heating source under the operating conditions in this work.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0963-0252	1361-6595		WOS:000552684300001

Pollen wall degradation in the Brassicaceae permits cell emergence after pollination								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY				104	8			1266	1273		10.3732/ajb.1700201				AUG 2017	2017	PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Despite attempts to degrade the sporopollenin in pollen walls, this material has withstood a hundred years of experimental treatments and thousands of years of environmental attack in insects and soil. We present evidence that sporopollenin, nonetheless, locally degrades only minutes after pollination in Arabidopsis thaliana flowers, and describe here a two-part pollen germination mechanism in A. thaliana involving both chemical weakening of the exine wall and swelling of the underlying intine.METHODS: We explored naturally occurring components from pollen and stigma surfaces and found a tripartite mix of hydrogen peroxide, peroxidase and catalase enzymes (all at high levels at the pollination interface) to be experimentally sufficient to degrade the sporopollenin of some Brassicaceae family members.KEY RESULTS: At pollination, factors carried on the pollen surface may mix with factors on the stigma surface in a reaction that locally oxidizes the exine pollen wall. Hydrogen peroxide, catalases, and peroxidases are biologically present at the right time and place and, when mixed experimentally, are sufficient to degrade the walls of susceptible pollen.CONCLUSIONS: Our work on native biochemistry for breaching sporopollenin suggests new research directions in pollen aperture evolution and could aid efforts to analyze sporopollenin's composition, needed for application of this corrosion-resistant, but long-intractable material.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			0002-9122	1537-2197		WOS:000418649800014	29756225

Species with broad geographical distributions may be thermal generalists that perform well across a broad range of temperatures, or they might contain subpopulations of locally adapted thermal specialists. We quantified the variation in thermal performance of two coral species, Porites cylindrica and Acropora spp., along a latitudinal gradient over which temperature varies by approximately 68 degrees C. Photosynthesis rates, respiration rates, maximum quantum yield and maximum electron transport rates were measured on coral fragments exposed to an acute temperature increase and decrease up to 58 degrees C above and below the local average temperature. Results showed geographical variation in the performance curves of both species at holobiont and symbiont level, but this did not lead to an alignment of the optimal temperature for performance with the average temperature of the local environment, suggesting suboptimal coral performance of these coral populations in summer. Furthermore, symbiont thermal performance generally had an optimum closer to the average environmental temperature than holobiont performance, suggesting that symbionts have a higher capacity for acclimatization than the coral host, and can aid the coral host when temperatures are unfavourable.This article is part of the theme issue 'Physiological diversity, biodiversity patterns and global climate change: testing key hypotheses involving temperature and oxygen'.									25	0	0	0	23	0	25			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000473329200004	31203761

However, little is known about the emergence of ARB in the gut after the combined exposure to antibiotics and non-antibiotic pharmaceutics. Here, Escherichia coli, a common opportunistic pathogen in the gut microbiota, was exposed to the antidepressant duloxetine (2.5 mu g/L-25 mg/L) and/or chloramphenicol (6 mu g/L-4 mg/L). The resistant strains were isolated to determine the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of 29 antibiotics. Then, genome-wide DNA sequencing, global transcriptomic sequencing, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction were performed to quantify the synergy between duloxetine and chloramphenicol. Combined exposure synergistically increased the mutation frequency of chloramphenicol resistance by 2.45-9.01 fold compared with the independent exposure. A combination index reaching 187.7 indicated strong duloxetine and chloramphenicol synergy. The resultant mutants presented heritable enhanced resistance to 12 antibiotics and became ARB to eight antibiotics. Furthermore, combined exposure significantly increased the transcriptomic expression of acrA, acrB, and marA in E. coli, and generated a more robust oxidative stress response. Together with the occurrence of DNA mutations in marR in the mutants, stronger triggers to the AcrAB-TolC transport system and the MlaFEDB ABC transporter via reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced mutagenesis, verified by gene knockout, contributed to the synergistic enhancement of antibiotic resistance in the combined exposure group. Regardless of whether their formation was induced by duloxetine, chloramphenicol, or their combination, the E. coli mutants showed 1.1-1.7-fold increases in the expression levels of acrA, acrB, acrZ, mdtE, and mdtF. This pattern indicated that the mutants shared the same resistance mechanisms against chloramphenicol, involving the improved efflux pumps AcrAB-TolC and mdtEF. Our findings demonstrated that antibiotics and non-antibiotic pharmaceutics synergistically accelerate the evolution of ARB and may enhance their spread.									5	1	0	0	3	0	6			1949-0976	1949-0984		WOS:000741147900001	35014598

The estuarine water was NO3- rich (125 to 600-mu-M), and NO3- was consistently taken up by the sediment on the four occasions studied. Total NO3- uptake (3.6 to 34.0 mmol of N m-2 day-1) corresponded closely to N2 production (denitrification) during the experimental steady state, which indicated that dissimilatory, as well as assimilatory, NO3- reduction to NH4+ was insignificant. When C2H2 was applied in the flow system, denitrification measured as N2O production was often less (58 to 100%) than the NO3- uptake because of incomplete inhibition of N2O reduction. The NO3- formed by nitrification and not immediately denitrified but released to the overlying water, uncoupled nitrification, was calculated both from (NO3-)-N-15 dilution and from changes in NO3- uptake before and after C2H2 addition. These two approaches gave similar results, with rates ranging between 0 and 8.1 mmol of N m-2 day-1 on the four occasions. Attempts to measure total nitrification activity by the difference between NH4 fluxes before and after C2H2 addition failed because of non-steady-state NH4+ fluxes. The vertical distribution of denitrification and oxygen consumption was studied by use of N2O and O2 microelectrodes. The N2O profiles measured during the experimental steady state were often irregularly shaped, and the buildup of N2O after C2H2 was added was much too fast to be described by a simple diffusion model. Only bioturbation by a dense population of infauna could explain these observations. This was corroborated by the relationship between diffusive and total fluxes, which showed that only 19 to 36 and 29 to 62% of the total O2 uptake and denitrification, respectively, were due to diffusion-reaction processes at the regular sediment surface, excluding animal burrows.									135	6	0	0	119	0	143			0099-2240			WOS:A1992GY25300046	16348630

Thus far, little is known about how exposed facets, an intrinsic nanomaterial property, may affect defect generation of widely used semiconductor nanomaterials, e.g., titanium dioxide (TiO2). Here, we synthesized two anatase TiO2 materials with different predominantly exposed facets (i.e., {101} and {010} facets, respectively), and manipulated the defects by calcination at 500 degrees C under an air or argon atmosphere. Through Raman, electron paramagnetic resonance, UV-vis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses, we demonstrated that the change of surface defect content was facet-dependent. Calcination in argon consistently increased the surface defect content for both materials, arising from the dissociation of surface oxygen atoms and removal of surface hydroxyl groups. In comparison, calcination in air decreased the surface defect content of the {101}-faceted material but increased that of the {010}-faceted material. This discrepancy was likely because, compared with the {101} facets, the {010} facets can lose surface oxygen more easily and contain a greater amount of surface hydroxyl groups. Accordingly, for the {010} facets the formation of surface defects can outcompete the annealing of defects, which occurs during thermal treatment in air. Photoluminescence analysis, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and photocatalytic activities towards bisphenol A, Rhodamine B and hexavalent chromium degradation were consistent with the changes of defect content of the TiO2 materials, corroborating that the altered defect properties were mainly associated with surface rather than bulk defects. The findings of this work may have important implications for photocatalyst design via defect engineering.									25	0	0	0	5	0	25			2051-8153	2051-8161		WOS:000471722600005

In the as-coated condition yttria-rich islands at the thermally-grown oxide (TGO)/TBC interface locally impede zirconia uptake of the scale during TBC deposition and give rise to the formation of an "off-plane" alumina-zirconia mixed zone textured perpendicular to the TGO/TBC interface. During prolonged isothermal/cyclic oxidation an increased chromium diffusion through the TGO scale turns the mixed zone into a reaction zone introducing a morphological instability of the mixed zone/TBC interface due to solutioning of the bottom TBC layer.This microstructural pattern is corroborated by a triple-stage growth model for the mixed zone during three successive stages in TBC lifetime: (i) during TBC deposition, the thickness of the mixed zone increases due to predominant outward aluminum diffusion and uptake of zirconia. No columnar alumina zone (CAZ) has formed at this stage, (ii) upon completion of the transition alumina-to-corundum phase transformation the thickness of the mixed zone remains constant while the change in diffusion mechanism for an inward oxygen diffusion process now initiates parabolic growth of the columnar alumina sublayer of the TGO scale, (iii) in the late stage of TBC lifetime an marked outward chromium diffusion from the bond coat causes the mixed zone to resume growth due to TBC destabilization and the formation of a (Al, Cr)(2)O-3 mixed oxide matrix phase.A transient YCrO3 phase is proposed for driving the destabilization of yttria-rich sections of the bottom TBC layer.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0960-3409			WOS:000238619900027

However, the pyrolysis process usually destroys the porous structure of MOFs and reduces the number of active sites due to the absence of organic ligands and agglomeration of metal centers. In this work, we prepared unique NiCo-MOF hollow nanospheres (NiCo-MOF HNSs) by a solvothermal method and further fabricated Fe-doped NiCo-MOF HNSs (Fe@NiCo-MOF HNSs) by a simple impregnation-drying method. Significant enhancement of electrocatalytic activity of Fe@NiCo-MOF HNSs was witnessed because of the doped Fe. Compared with the parent NiCo-MOF HNSs, the optimized Fe@NiCo-MOF HNSs exhibited a lower overpotential of 244 mV at 10 mA center dot cm(-2)with a smaller Tafel slope of 48.61 mV center dot dec(-1), which was lowered byca.90 mV due to the influence of Fe doping on the electronic structure of the active centers of Ni and Co. The above materials also displayed excellent stability without obvious activity decay for at least 16 hours. These findings present a new entry in the design and fabrication of high-efficiency MOF-based electrocatalysts for energy conversion.									24	0	0	0	2	0	24			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000547632900012	32579652

However, these properties are irreversibly altered when the sludge is exposed to heat (e.g. either passing through heat exchangers of anaerobic digesters or during thermal pretreatment process before digesters). Literature showed that thermal pre-treatment of waste activated sludge (WAS) solubilises particulate organic matter in sludge and increases the biodegradability of WAS in anaerobic digesters.This paper reports the similarity between the kinetic of rheological enhancements due to thermal treatment and the rate of organic matter solubilisation in the WAS when it is subjected to cyclic thermal treatment between 20 and 80 degrees C up to 1 h. This work observed the evolution of rheological characteristics and soluble oxygen demand (sCOD) of 3.5-9.9 wt.% WAS at different temperatures and for different thermal histories (1 h thermal treatment at 50, 60, 70 and 80 degrees C).Results showed that, the rate of yield stress and infinite viscosity reductions due to thermal treatment (for 1 h treatment at 50, 60, 70 and 80 degrees C) were linearly proportional to the rate of solubilisation of organic matter. Because similar results were observed in the literature with digested sludge, these results confirmed that rheological measurement (e.g. infinite viscosity and yield stress) can be used to predict the level of solubilisation of organic matter in any type of sludge when it is exposed to thermal treatment. Vice versa, the rate of COD changes can be used as an indicator of the rate of rheological changes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

SWNT-in-polymer blend nanofibers (SPNFs) were fabricated as a carbon-precursor with PMMA and PAN as the constituent polymers. The carbonized products of the SPNFs (CSPNFs) showed a unique morphology consisting of thin nanofibers with diameters less than 200 nm assembled into larger fibrous architectures. The surface area and pore volume of the CSPNFs increased proportionally with the amount of SWNTs added to the precursor. Representatively, CSPNF-3 had the highest surface area (-600 m(2) g(-1)) and meso/macropore volumes (total-60 cm(3) g(-1)). The introduction of binary transition metal oxide (BTMO) phases into the CSPNFs as a support was also achieved with the aid of a stabilizer/dispersant polymer via dip coating followed by thermal reduction. The resulting CMSPNFs, where M indicates the introduced metal elements, were applied as electrocatalysts for water splitting. The CMSPNFs decorated with BTMO nanoparticles (diameter, 7-17 nm) exhibited higher electrocatalytic activities than the control prepared without SWNTs. The CMSPNF prepared with Ni and Fe precursors was found to be the best catalyst for either half-reaction (OER or HER), as well as in a symmetric two-electrode cell for both reactions. The demonstrated modulation of multi-polymer phase behavior by SWNTs can be applied to various combi-nations of precursor polymers and shows great promise for creating high-performance heterogeneous catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000772756000001

Here, we show that a decrease of the relative contribution of the I-P phase, delta V-IP = -V (I) = (F-M -F-I)/(F-M - F-o), to the fluorescence transient OJIP is observed in 10 drought-stressed barley and 9 chickpea varieties. The extent of the I-P loss in the barley varieties depended on their drought tolerance. The relative loss of the I-P phase seems to be related to a loss of photosystem (PS) I reaction centers as determined by 820-nm transmission measurements. In the second part of this study, the interaction of drought and heat stress in two barley varieties (the drought tolerant variety Aumlt Baha and the drought sensitive variety Lannaceur) was studied using a new approach. Heat stress was induced by exposing the plant leaves to temperatures of 25-45 degrees C and the inactivation of the O-2-evolving complex (OEC) was followed measuring chlorophyll a (Chl a) fluorescence using a protocol consisting of two 5-ms pulses spaced 2.3 ms apart. In active reaction centers, the dark interval is long enough to allow the OEC to recover from the first pulse; whereas in heat-inactivated reaction centers it is not. In the latter category of reaction centers, no further fluorescence rise is induced by the second pulse. Lannaceur, under well-watered conditions, was more heat tolerant than Ait Baha. However, this difference was lost following drought stress. Drought stress considerably increased the thermostability of PS II of both varieties.									207	17	1	0	192	4	227			0031-9317	1399-3054		WOS:000269706500009	19719481

Illumination of these inhibited preparations at 273 K generates a paramagnetic species that is detectable by low-temperature (T < 20 K) EPR as a signal in the g = 2 region, 90-230 G wide, depending on the treatment that PSII has undergone. This signal has recently been assigned to Y-Z(.) in magnetic interaction with the manganese cluster in its S-2 State [Gilchrist et al. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 92, 9545-9549]. This view, however, is not universal, owing, in part, to the fact that its spectroscopic properties depend on the preparation and the experimental conditions used for its study and, in part, to uncertainties as to the room temperature behavior of Yi in inhibited preparations. Here, we report time-resolved and conventional EPR data showing that, at room temperature and at 273 K, Y-Z(.) can be accumulated in its 20 G form in high yields in both Ca2+-depleted and acetate-inhibited preparations, and that the kinetics of its decay match the decay kinetics of the low-temperature signal generated in corresponding samples. The properties of the Y-Z(.) signal, however, are shown to depend on the polypeptide content, the temperature, and the electron donors and accepters present in the sample under examination. Our results support assignment of the EPR signal in inhibited preparations to S-2 Y-Z(.) and demonstrate a protective role of the 17 and 23 kDa extrinsic polypeptides for the manganese cluster against externally added reductants.									29	0	0	0	17	0	29			0006-2960			WOS:000073585600026	9572860

The process was monitored for 8 weeks during an initial period of sub-optimal operation due to severe acidogenesis, and after management interventions to re-establish normal composting activity.Results Interstitial gas analysis demonstrated that acidogenesis coincided with adequate O-2 concentrations, therefore, the development of anaerobic conditions in the reactor, whilst a possible contributory mechanism, was not considered to be the main reason for process failure. The key factors influencing the pH value of the compost mixture and inhibiting the temperature rise to thermophilic conditions were identified as the FW MC and acidity. The influence of MC on composting temperature was probably initiated through its effect on the process thermodynamics by increasing thermal conductivity and losses and the specific heat of the composting mixture. This potentially restricted the temperature rise and the metabolism of organic acids reducing the pH value, which initiated a pH mediated feedback mechanism leading to further acidogenesis, aerobic microbial inhibition and temperature reduction.Conclusions The upper critical MC determined for invessel shredded FW composting was 40 %. Monitoring of CO2 evolution and O-2 utilisation gave a good indication of the progress of the composting process.									9	0	0	0	4	0	9			1877-2641	1877-265X		WOS:000354634400003		
J	Fox, Jane L.; Hac, Aleksander								Isotope fractionation in the photochemical escape of O from Mars								ICARUS				208	1			176	191		10.1016/j.icarus.2010.01.019				JUL 2010	2010	The production of energetic and escaping neutral O atoms at the current epoch in the martian thermosphere is thought to be dominated by the O-2(+) dissociative recombination process:O-2(+) + e -> O+ + O* +Delta E In this equation, O* represents a fast O atom and Delta E is the energy released. There are five energetically allowed channels of this reaction, with exothermicities, and thus O kinetic energies, that depend on the electronic energies of the O atoms produced, on the vibrational and rotational states of the initial O-2(+) ions, and on the ion and electron velocities. We have recently reported the escape probabilities and rates for O-16 produced in dissociative recombination of (OO)-O-16-O-16+ for 60 degrees solar zenith angle low and high solar activity models of the martian thermosphere/ionosphere (Fox, J.L., Hac, A. [2009]. Icarus 204,527-544). Because the isotope ratios of atmospheric species, including O-18/O-16, contain information about the evolution of the atmosphere, we investigate here the probabilities for escape of energetic O-18 produced in dissociative recombination of the isotopomer (OO+)-O-18-O-16. We first predict the altitude dependent vibrational distribution of (OO+)-O-18-O-16(v), and we compute the nascent energy distributions of the fast O-18 atoms as functions of vibrational excitation, of the electron and ion temperatures, and of the rotational distributions of the ions; we compare these energy distributions to those of O-16 produced in DR of (OO+)-O-16-O-16(v), We then use a 1-D spherical Monte Carlo code to determine escape probabilities for O-18 as functions of energy and altitude. In this code, energetic atoms are followed in spherical geometry from their altitude of production from one collision to the next through the background atmosphere until their energies fall below the escape energy, or they reach an altitude of 700 km with energies above the escape energy. We convolve these escape probabilities with the nascent energy distributions to determine the probabilities of escape of O-18 produced in DR of (OO+)-O-18-O-16. We find that there is a substantial altitude dependent isotope effect, which operates in addition to the effects of diffusive separation of the neutral species from which the O-2(+) ions are created.

J	Nassoury, N; Fritz, L; Morse, D								Circadian changes in ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase distribution inside individual chloroplasts can account for the rhythm in dinoflagellate carbon fixation								PLANT CELL				13	4			923	934						APR 2001	2001	Previous studies of photosynthetic carbon fixation in the marine alga Gonyaulax have shown that the reaction rates in vivo vary threefold between day and night but that the in vitro activity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in this process, remains constant. Using protein gel blotting, we confirm that Rubisco protein levels are constant over time, We present simultaneous measurements of the rhythms of CO2 fixation and O-2 evolution and show that the two rhythms are similar to6 hr out of phase. We further show that the distribution of Rubisco within chloroplasts varies as a function of circadian time and that this rhythm in Rubisco distribution correlates with the CO2 fixation rhythm. At times of high carbon fixation, Rubisco is found in pyrenoids, regions of the chloroplasts located near the cell center, and is separated from most of the light-harvesting protein PCP (for peridinin-chlorophyll a-protein), which is found in cortical regions of the plastids. We propose that the rhythm in Rubisco distribution is causally related to the rhythm in carbon fixation and suggest that several mechanisms involving enzyme sequestration could account for the increase in the efficiency of carbon fixation.									70	2	0	0	67	0	73			1040-4651			WOS:000168219000015	11283345	
J	Gao, Tianyu; Zhang, Hanmin; Xu, Xiaotong; Teng, Jiaheng					Teng, Jiaheng/0000-0002-8476-8177			Mutual effects of CO2 absorption and H-2-mediated electromethanogenesis triggering efficient biogas upgrading								SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				818						151732	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.151732				APR 20 2022	2022	Anaerobic digestion coupled with bioelectrochemical system (BES) is a promising approach for biogas upgrading with low energy input. However, the alkalinity generation from electromethanogenesis is invariably ignored which could serve as a potential assistant for CO2 removal through the transformation into dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Herein, a novel bioelectrochemical CO2 conversion in the methanogenic BES was proposed based on active CO2 capture and in-situ microbial utilization. It was found that the BES using a stainless steel/carbon felt hybrid biocathode (BES-SSCF reactor) achieved a CH4 yield of 0.33 +/- 0.03 LCH4/gCOD(removal) and increased CH4 production rate by 28.3% of BES-CF reactor at 1.0 V applied voltage. As the experiment progressed, CH4 content increased to 93.1% and CO2 content in the upgraded biogas maintained at below 3%. The continuous proton consumption from H-2 evolution reaction in the hybrid biocathode was capable of creating a slightly alkaline condition in the BES-SSCF reactor and thereby the CO2 capture as bicarbonate was enhanced through endogenous alkalinity absorption. Microbial community analysis revealed that significant enrichment of Methanobacterium and Methanosarcina at the BES-SSCF cathodic biofilm was favorable for bicarbonate reduction into CH4 via establishment of H-2-mediated electron transfer. Consequently, the remained CO2 and DIC only accounted for 12% of total carbon in the BES-SSCF reactor and the high conversion rate of CO2 to CH4 (82.3%) was achieved. These results unraveled an innovative CO2 utilization mechanism integrating CO2 absorption with H-2-mediated electromethanogenesis. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In the planetary interiors, these ices will experience extreme pressure conditions, around 5 Mbar at the Neptune mantle-core boundary, and it is expected that they undergo phase transitions, decompose, and form entirely new compounds. While temperature will dictate the formation of compounds, groundstate density functional theory allows us to probe the chemical effects resulting from pressure alone. These structural developments in turn determine the planets' interior structures, thermal evolution, and magnetic field generation, among others. Despite its importance, the H-C-N-O system has not been surveyed systematically to explore which compounds emerge at high-pressure conditions, and what governs their stability. Here, we report on and analyze an unbiased crystal structure search among H-C- N-O compounds between 1 and 5 Mbar. We demonstrate that simple chemical rules drive stability in this composition space, which explains why the simplest possible quaternary mixture HCNO-isoelectronic to diamond-emerges as a stable compound and discuss dominant decomposition products of planetary ice mixtures.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0027-8424	1091-6490		WOS:000651331900006	33931549

Compared with pure CdS, 0.5-CdS/CdWO4 composites exhibit 3-fold higher photocurrent density in photocurrent response experiment and smaller charge-transfer resistance in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) which manifested the efficacious separation of photo-generated charges. Radical trapping experiments and XPS further demonstrate the transfer of photo-generated charges followed Z-scheme system. This work presents a new design of CdS/CdWO4 composites in formation of Z-scheme heterojunction. Based on the outcomes of UV-vis spectra and Mott-Schottky plots, the photocatalytic mechanism of H-2 production and MG photodegradation over CdS/CdWO4 composites under visible-light irradiation was proposed.									94	7	0	0	8	0	94			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000438578700097

The time evolution of Hyp fluorescence originating from Hyp monomers dissolved in the GUV membrane has been recorded by confocal microscopy and while trapping individual GUVs in optical tweezers. It was shown that after reaching a maximum, the fluorescence intensity gradually decreased toward longer times. Formation of oversized Hyp clusters has been observed on the GUV surface at prolonged time. A simplified kinetic Monte Carlo model is presented to follow the aggregation/dissociation processes of Hyp molecules in the membrane. The simulation results reproduced the basic experimental observations: the scaling of the characteristic fluorescence decay time with the vesicle diameter and the buildup of large Hyp clusters in the GUV membrane.									9	1	0	0	4	0	10			0006-3495	1542-0086		WOS:000396818600016	28297655

The virulence of Brucella primarily depends on its successful survival and replication in host cells. During invasion of the host tissue, Brucella is simultaneously subjected to a variety of harsh conditions, including nutrient limitation, low pH, antimicrobial defenses, and extreme levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via the host immune response. This suggests that Brucella may be able to regulate its metabolic adaptation in response to the distinct stresses encountered during its intracellular infection of the host. An investigation into the differential proteome expression patterns of Brucella grown under the relevant stress conditions may contribute toward a better understanding of its pathogenesis and adaptive response. Here, we utilized amass spectrometry-based label-free relative quantitative proteomics approach to investigate and compare global proteomic changes in B. abortus in response to eight different stress treatments. The 3 h short-termin vitro single-stress and multi-stress conditions mimicked the in vivo conditions of B. abortus under intracellular infection, with survival rates ranging from 3.17 to 73.17%. The proteomic analysis identified and quantified a total of 2,272 proteins and 74% of the theoretical proteome, thereby providing wide coverage of the B. abortus proteome. By including eight distinct growth conditions and comparing these with a control condition, we identified a total of 1,221 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) that were significantly changed under the stress treatments. Pathway analysis revealed that most of the proteins were involved in oxidative phosphorylation, ABC transporters, two-component systems, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, the citrate cycle, thiamine metabolism, and nitrogen metabolism; constituting major response mechanisms toward the reconstruction of cellular homeostasis and metabolic balance under stress. In conclusion, our results provide a better understanding of the global metabolic adaptations of B. abortus associated with distinct environmental stresses. The identification of proteins necessary for stress resistance is crucial toward elucidating the infectious process in order to control brucellosis, and may facilitate the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and effective vaccines.									12	0	0	0	9	0	12				1664-302X		WOS:000416402900001	29238329	
J	Cheng, Ye; Zhou, Wenjun; Zhu, Lizhong								Enhanced reactivity and mechanisms of mesoporous carbon supported zero-valent iron composite for trichloroethylene removal in batch studies								SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				718						137256	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.137256				MAY 20 2020	2020	Ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-3) supported nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) composites were synthesized and used for the removal of trichloroethylene (TCE). The nZV1/CMK-3 composites exhibited high TCE removal efficiency in a batch study, which was 2.5 times that of nZVI alone. They also displayed excellent reusability, with 65.2% removal efficiency after three treatments. Dechlorination dominated the process of TCE removal (75.3%-79.4%), whereas adsorption accounted for 20.6%-24.7%. CMK-3 enhanced the dechlorination rate and efficiency of TCE by nZVI, and the enhancement was favored with the increase in CMK-3 content. The Tafel analysis and H2 evolution experiments indicated the mechanisms of CMK-3 action in nZVI/CMK-3 composites for TCE removal. CMK-3 serves as a direct electron transfer, whereas C=O was identified as the functional group involved; the other involved the acceleration of redox react ion of atomic hydrogen owing to the superior hydrogen adsorption capacity of CMK-3. The present study provides new perspectives for seeking more efficient nZVI to reinforce the dechlorination process; however, more studies are warranted in the long-term performance of nZVI/CMK-3 in the aquifer condition.

So far, the FDP-mediated O-2 photo-reduction has been evidenced only in cyanobacteria and the moss Physcomitrella; however, a recent phylogenetic analysis of transcriptomes of photosynthetic organisms has also revealed the presence of FDP genes in several nonflowering plant groups. What remains to be clarified is whether the FDP-dependent O-2 photo-reduction is actually operational in these organisms.We have established a simple method for the monitoring of FDP-mediated O-2 photoreduction, based on the measurement of redox kinetics of P700 (the electron donor of photosystem I) upon dark-to-light transition. The O-2 photo-reduction is manifested as a fast re-oxidation of P700. The validity of the method was verified by experiments with transgenic organisms, namely FDP knock-out mutants of Synechocystis and Physcomitrella and transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing FDPs from Physcomitrella.We observed the fast P700 re-oxidation in representatives of all green plant groups excluding angiosperms.Our results provide strong evidence that the FDP-mediated O-2 photo-reduction is functional in all nonflowering green plant groups. This finding suggests a major change in the strategy of photosynthetic regulation during the evolution of angiosperms.									88	1	0	0	83	0	88			0028-646X	1469-8137		WOS:000402403900010	28304077

Herein, Bi-.(333)(Bi6S9)Br/Bi2S3 heterostructure nanorods were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method, and the photocatalytic reduction of Cr (VI) under visible light irradiation was conducted to evaluate their photocatalytic performance. Sulfur defects were introduced into the Bi-.(333)(Bi6S9)Br/Bi2S3 hybrid nanorods in a controlled way during the phase evolution. Microstructural analysis shows that the interface of Bi-.(333)(Bi6S9)Br/Bi2S3 heterostructure consists of (130) facet of Bi-.(333)(Bi6S9)Br and (300) facet of Bi2S3. The high performance of the Bi-.( )333(Bi6S9)Br/Bi2S3 hybrid nanorods was ascribed to sulfur defects and direct Z-scheme heterostructure. The sulfur defects can effectively adsorb and activate Cr (VI) while a direct Z-scheme mechanism between Bi-.(333) (Bi6S9)Br and Bi2S3 significantly improved the separation and transfer efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes. This work provides a new strategy for the design of advanced photocatalytic materials.									23	0	0	0	6	0	23			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000623588500002

The greatest H-2 production was 1.39 mmol within 5 h, which is 35 times the generation of pristine CdS NSs. Additionally, the fabricated 0D/2D heterojunction photocatalyst demonstrated excellent stability, and the external quantum efficiency of the optimised photocatalyst was calculated to be 18.63% at 450 nm. The enhancement mechanisms resulting in high activity and stability were investigated using various characterisation techniques, which revealed that the construction of 0D/2D heterojunctions with close interfacial contact between OD FeP NPs and 2D CdS NSs can accelerate photoexcited e(-)-h(+) pairs transfer and separation, thereby enhancing photocatalytic H-2 production performance and stability. This study offers new insights into the design of 0D/2D heterojunction photocatalysts for applications in the field of photocatalysis.									35	3	0	0	6	0	36			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000510846500007

Although this approach has been studied for decades using inorganic semiconductor photocatalysts, organic semiconductors have only recently gained notable attention. The tunable energy levels of organic semiconductors can enable the design of photocatalysts with optimized solar light utilization. However, the solar conversion efficiency of organic semiconductor photocatalysts has so far been limited by their low quantum efficiencies. To address this issue, various photocatalyst design strategies including semiconductor energy level optimization, surface modification, and the fabrication of heterojunctions have been applied, resulting in substantial increases in photocatalytic efficiency. This progress report systematically describes the strategies employed to increase the efficiency of organic semiconductor photocatalysts for the generation of solar fuels from water and carbon dioxide. Particular attention is given to describing strategies to enhance quantum efficiency, and insights are provided on the mechanisms underlying their success to aid the rational design of future organic photocatalysts. Perspectives on the future challenges and promising research directions for the design of efficient organic photocatalysts for the generation of solar fuels are also provided.									45	3	0	0	2	0	45			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000564960100001

We show that textured commercial Si-pn(+) photovoltaics protected by solution-processed semiconducting/conducting oxides (plausibly suitable for scalable manufacturing) and coupled to thin layers of Ir yield high-performance H-2-evolving photocathodes in base. They also serve as excellent test structures to understand corrosion mechanisms and optimize interfacial electrical contacts between various functional layers. Solution-deposited TiO2 protects Si-pn(+) junctions from corrosion for similar to 24 h in base, whereas junctions protected by F:SnO2 fail after only 1 h of electrochemical cycling. Interface layers consisting of Ti metal and/or the highly doped F:SnO2 between the Si and TiO2 reduce Si-emitter/oxide/catalyst contact resistance and thus increase fill factor and efficiency. Controlling the oxide thickness led to record photocurrents near 35 mA cm(-2) at 0 V vs RHE and photocathode efficiencies up to 10.9% in the best cells. Degradation, however, was not completely suppressed. We demonstrate that performance degrades by two mechanisms, (1) deposition of impurities onto the thin catalyst layers, even from high-purity base, and (2) catastrophic failure via pinholes in the oxide layers after several days of operation. These results provide insight into the design of hydrogen-evolving photoelectrodes in basic conditions, and highlight challenges.									69	2	0	0	5	0	69			1944-8244			WOS:000347139400130	25469622

However, we found methanogens of the genera Methanosarcina and Methanocella to be present in many types of upland soils (including dryland soils) sampled globally. These methanogens could be readily activated by incubating the soils as slurry under anoxic conditions, as seen by rapid methane production within a few weeks, without any additional carbon source. Analysis of the archaeal 16S ribosomal RNA gene community profile in the incubated samples through terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and quantification through quantitative PCR indicated dominance of Methanosarcina, whose gene copy numbers also correlated with methane production rates. Analysis of the delta C-13 of the methane further supported this, as the dominant methanogenic pathway was in most cases aceticlastic, which Methanocella cannot perform. Sequences of the key methanogenic enzyme methyl coenzyme M reductase retrieved from the soil samples before incubation confirmed that Methanosarcina and Methanocella are the dominant methanogens, though some sequences of Methanobrevibacter and Methanobacterium were also detected. The global occurrence of only two active methanogenic archaea supports the hypothesis that these are autochthonous members of the upland soil biome and are well adapted to their environment.

Herein, a class of unique RuCo nanoscrews (NSs) for water electrosplitting is successfully synthesized with rough surfaces and the exposure of steps and edges. Those high-index faceted RuCo NSs show superior performance for overall water electrosplitting, where a low cell voltage of 1.524 V (@ 10 mA cm(-2)) and excellent stability for more than 20 h (@ 10 mA cm(-2)) for overall water electrosplitting in 1 m KOH is achieved. The enhanced performance of RuCo NSs is due to the optimization of the binding energy with the intermediate species and the reduced energy barrier of water dissociation. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the RuCo NS structure intrinsically endows various ridges and edges, which create low coordinated Ru- and Co-sites. These active Ru- and Co-sites present high efficiencies in electronic exchange and transfer between adsorbing O species and nearby lattice sites, guaranteeing the high H2O-splitting activities. This present work opens up a new strategy for creating high-performance electrocatalysts for water splitting.									21	0	0	0	2	0	21			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000584523700001

We start this short review with the main observational facts that lead to the theoretical model of a thermonuclear runaway that takes place in an accreted hydrogen rich envelope placed on top of a cool degenerate core of a white dwarf. According to the theory, the accreted envelope becomes unstable to convection days to weeks prior to the runaway. During the extreme stages of the runaway itself, when the burning is most efficient, the envelope is fully convective. Therefore, the elements processed under such extreme conditions are lifted to the outermost regions of the star. A significant fraction of the envelope is ejected during the outburst. The complicated combination of hydrodynamic instabilities and explosive hydrogen burning, close to the surface of the star, gives us a unique opportunity to study this complex reactive flow. The range of core masses, core temperatures and accretion rates introduce a whole range of burning temperatures and densities. Following the description of the. standard. cases, we then focus on rare, but still possible, portions of the relevant parameter space, in which "breakout" of the traditional CNO cycle can occur and lead to heavy element enrichment patterns caused only by breakout burning. We conclude our review with the main challenges that nova theorists face today, with special emphasis on problems related to the nucleosynthesis issues.					5th Biannual Conference on Nuclear Physics in Astrophysics (NPA)/24th Nuclear Physics Divisional Conference of the European-Physical-Society (EPS)5th Biannual Conference on Nuclear Physics in Astrophysics (NPA)/24th Nuclear Physics Divisional Conference of the European-Physical-Society (EPS)	APR 03-08, 2011APR 03-08, 2011	European Phys Soc (EPS), Nucl Phys Div; Hebrew Univ; Soreq Nucl Res Ctr; Tel Aviv Univ; Weizmann Inst SciEuropean Phys Soc (EPS), Nucl Phys Div; Hebrew Univ; Soreq Nucl Res Ctr; Tel Aviv Univ; Weizmann Inst Sci	Eilat, ISRAELEilat, ISRAEL	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1742-6588		*****************	WOS:000300434600071

Experiments are performed with 200-fs time resolution on OClO dissolved in water, cyclohexane, acetonitrile, and chloroform. In all solvents, a reduction in optical density is observed at early times and is attributed to stimulated emission from the Optically prepared (2)A(2) surface. The emission decays on the subpicosecond time scale to reveal an increase in optical density corresponding to the production of vibrationally hot ground-state OClO formed by geminate recombination of the primary photoproducts. Kinetic analysis of these data reveals that the excited-state decay time constant increases from similar to 200 fs in water and cyclohexane to similar to 400 fs in acetonitrile and chloroform. The vibrational-relaxation dynamics of OClO are also found to be solvent dependent in agreement with earlier work. Pump-probe anisotropy experiments on aqueous OClO are presented. In these studies, an initial anisotropy of 0.40 +/- 0.05 is observed consistent with emission from the optically prepared (2)A(2) state. However, the optical-density evolution for vibrationally hot OClO displays an anisotropy of 0.08 +/- 0.03 suggesting that the mechanism of geminate recombination results in the retention of memory regarding the photoexcitation event. Potential recombination mechanisms consistent with this result are discussed.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			1089-5639			WOS:000172020100002

Herein, Ni3S2/MoS2/FeOOH hierarchical microspheres constructed by nanobelt building blocks were directly grown on Ni foam via a simple one-pot hydrothermal approach. Benefitting from the synergistic effect of these components as well as the unique hierarchical microsphere structure, Ni3S2/MoS2/FeOOH exhibits superior dual-function electrocatalytic activity for water splitting in 1.0 M KOH, with low overpotentials of 219 mV for OER at 100 mA cm(-2) and 76 mV for HER at 10 mA cm(-2). The electrolyzer based on the Ni3S2/MoS2/FeOOH electrodes only needs a low cell voltage of 1.52 V to drive water splitting at 10 mA cm(-2), which is comparable to the state-of-the-art Pt-C||IrO2 couple (1.50 V). The cost-efficient and high-performance Ni3S2/MoS2/FeOOH bifunctional electrocatalyst developed in this work exhibits a potential application prospect in industrial hydrogen production.									6	2	0	0	0	0	7			2196-0216			WOS:000597691400001

This foundational observation has allowed us to develop Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, into a powerful model to study innate immunity in animals. Thanks to an ever-growing arsenal of genetic tools, an easily manipulated genome, and its winning disposition, Drosophila is now employed to study not only basic molecular mechanisms of pathogen recognition and immune signaling, but also the nature of physiological responses activated in the host by microbial challenge and how dysregulation of these processes contributes to disease. Here, we present a collection of methods and protocols to challenge the fly with an assortment of microbes, both systemically and orally, and assess its humoral, cellular, and epithelial response to infection. Our review covers techniques for measuring the reaction to microbial infection both qualitatively and quantitatively. Specifically, we describe survival, bacterial load, BLUD (a measure of disease tolerance), phagocytosis, melanization, clotting, and ROS production assays, as well as efficient protocols to collect hemolymph and measure immune gene expression. We also offer an updated catalog of online resources and a collection of popular reporter lines and mutants to facilitate research efforts.

Nevertheless, for the more economical alkaline hydrogen generation, the restricted kinetics of the water dissociation Volmer step along with its following proton recombination Tafel step for these non-noble electrocatalysts generally lead to sluggish hydrogen-production process. Here, a facile method is designed to nest nanometric Ni5P4 clusters on NiCo2O4 (achieving Ni5P4@NiCo2O4) by a phosphating process of NiO clusters on NiCo2O4. Acting as a high-efficiency electrode for alkaline water electrolysis, the Ni5P4@NiCo2O4 can efficiently and preferentially convert H2O to H-2 with a low overpotential of 27 mV at 10 mAcm(-2) and the Tafel slope of 27 mV dec(-1), which are comparable to the results for platinum and superior than those of the state-of-the-art platinum-free electrocatalysts. Density functional theory calculations confirm that NiCo2O4 species exhibit a higher ability to electrolyze water into H* intermediate and then Ni5P4 clusters facilitate the subsequent desorption of the H-2 products. Profiting from the promoted kinetic steps, the Ni5P4@NiCo2O4 electrocatalyst is promising for scalable alkaline hydrogen production.									113	3	0	0	2	0	115			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000447257000008

An external power supply for driving the oxidation or reduction reactions of H2O molecules is mandatory for electrolysis. Harvesting energy from our living environment for electrolytic water splitting is a cost-effective technology for mass production of H-2. Here, a coaxial rotatory freestanding triboelectric nanogenerator (CRF-TENG) wind energy harvester was demonstrated, in which the electrospinning PVDF nanofibrous membrane served as triboelectric material. And then a fully self-powered water splitting system for hydrogen production was presented based on the CRF-TENG. By scavenging ambient wind energy, the generated electricity is used for water splitting to produce H-2, instead of the external power source. The amounts of H-2 were measured by a gas circulation system and gas chromatograph and the H-2 evolution rates were calculated. When the wind speed is 10 m/s, the hydrogen generation rate reaches 6.9685 mu L/min in the 1 M KOH solution, suggesting an easy scale-up and efficient route for converting ambient mechanical energy into hydrogen energy. Such self-powered water splitting system opens up a new road to more energy applications.									63	7	0	0	0	0	67			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000438076200065

The resultant AgNbO3 by the reaction between Ag and Nb2O5 at high temperatures turns out to be the key to enable a desirable wetting of the YSZ by the braze filler. Typical interfacial microstructure of the YSZ/AISI 310s brazed joints are characterized by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Effects ofNb(2)O(5) contents and joining parameters on the microstructural evolution and mechanical performance of the joints are investigated. Joints with a maximum average strength of 100-110 MPa are achieved when bonding at 1150 degrees C/30 min with 5 mol.% Ag-Nb2O5. The long-term stability of the YSZ/Ag-Nb2O5/AISI 3105 joints are evaluated in air for over 350 hat 800 degrees C and no cracks or cell degradation are found in the joints after the aging process, indicating that the new-developed Ag-Nb2O5 is a promising candidate as the sealant for the SOFC stacks.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000512219600135

However, recent developments impose the use of these materials at higher temperatures than those initially envisaged (above 400 degrees C), revealing some uncertainties of their behavior. Depending on the operating conditions, the material can be exposed to variable humidity levels and, in some cases, can be in contact with silica or marine salt. This study aims to evaluate the influence of NaCl solid deposit on the behavior of beta 21S Ti alloy at 560 degrees C under realistic ambient atmospheres. The tests were carried out in laboratory air and in water vapor-enriched air, on uncoated samples and on samples with solid NaCl deposit. The reaction-product evolution (up to 600 h) was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis, SEM observations (surface and cross section), XRD and micro-hardness profiling on cross sections. An aggravation of the corrosion phenomena in the presence of NaCl solid deposit was observed, that was related to the presence of gaseous metal chlorides, leading to the establishment of an active corrosion process.					9th International Conference on High Temperature Corrosion and Protection of Materials (HTCPM)9th International Conference on High Temperature Corrosion and Protection of Materials (HTCPM)	MAY 15-20, 2016MAY 15-20, 2016		FRANCEFRANCE	9	1	0	0	0	0	10			0030-770X	1573-4889		WOS:000400404900012

Rapid engagement of immune cells provides a critical first line of defense soon after pathogen infiltration. Activation leads to a well-orchestrated set of events that sees the induction and regulation of intracellular and extracellular antimicrobial defenses. An array of regulatory mediators, highly toxic soluble molecules, degradative enzymes and antimicrobial peptides provides maximal protection against a wide range of pathogens while limiting endogenous damage to host tissues. In this review we highlight recent advances in our understanding of innate cellular antimicrobial responses of teleost fish and discuss their implications to cell survival, immunomodulation and death. The evolutionary conservation of these responses is a testament to their effectiveness against pathogen infiltration and their commitment to effective maintenance of host homeostasis. Importantly, recent developments in teleost fish systems have identified novel host defense strategies that may be unique to this lower vertebrate group or may point to previously unknown innate mechanisms that also play a significant role in higher vertebrate host immunity.

Cyanidin 3-rutinoside and cyanidin 3-glucoside were the main anthocyanins identified in fresh olives, and they were not detected after 1 month of storage either in brine or in olive. The fruit colors were different when aerobic or anaerobic conditions were used and as a consequence of the different anthocyanin polymerizations that took place. At time zero, the polyphenols observed in the olive juice were hydroxytyrosol-4-beta-glucoside, oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, salidroside, and verbascoside and, after 12 months, the main phenol was hydroxytyrosol. The polyphenol content in the oil phase of olives was also analyzed. The dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, oleuropein aglycon, and ligstroside aglycon were the main compounds found at the beginning of fermentation but were not detected after 3 months. In contrast, hydroxytyrosol, hydroxytyrosol acetate, tyrosol, and tyrosol acetate were the main polyphenols detected in the oil phase of the final product. The acid hydrolysis of the initial glucosides (in olive juice) and the aglycons (in oil phase) was, therefore, the main reaction that took place during fermentation.									65	0	0	0	48	0	66			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000220636900029	15053538

Intense photodissociation was observed starting at 4.5 eV for two to eight water molecules with loss of atomic hydrogen, molecular hydrogen and water molecules. Quantum chemical calculations for n=2 reveal that solvation shifts the intense 3s-3p excitations of Al+ into the investigated photon energy range below 5.5 eV. During the photochemical relaxation, internal conversion from S-1 to T-2 takes place, and photochemical hydrogen formation starts on the T-2 surface, which passes through a conical intersection, changing to T-1. On this triplet surface, the electron that was excited to the Al 3p orbital is transferred to a coordinated water molecule, which dissociates into a hydroxide ion and a hydrogen atom. If the system remains in the triplet state, this hydrogen radical is lost directly. If the system returns to singlet multiplicity, the reaction may be reversed, with recombination with the hydroxide moiety and electron transfer back to aluminium, resulting in water evaporation. Alternatively, the hydrogen radical can attack the intact water molecule, forming molecular hydrogen and aluminium dihydroxide. Photodissociation is observed for up to n=8. Clusters with n=9 or 10 occur exclusively as HAlOH+(H2O)(n-1) and are transparent in the investigated energy range. For n=4-8, a mixture of Al+(H2O)(n) and HAlOH+(H2O)(n-1) is present in the experiment.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000714562300001	34636449

These organisms are able to functionally link photosynthetic water oxidation to the catalytic recombination of protons and electrons to generate H-2 gas through the activity of the hydrogenase enzyme. Green algal hydrogenases contain a unique metallo-catalytic H-cluster that performs the reversible H-2 oxidation /evolution reactions. The H-cluster, located in the interior of the protein structure is irreversibly inactivated by O-2, the by-product of water oxidation. We developed an Escherichia coli expression system to produce [FeFe]-hydrogenases from different biological sources and demonstrated that clostridial [FeFe]-hydrogenases have higher tolerance to O-2 inactivation compared to their algal counterparts. We have been using computational simulations of gas diffusion within the Clostridium pasteurianum CpI hydrogenase to identify the pathways through which O-2 can reach its catalytic site. Subsequently, we modify the protein structure at specific sites along the O-2 pathways (identified by the computational simulations) by site-directed mutagenesis with the goal of generating recombinant enzymes with higher O-2 tolerance. In this paper, we review the computational simulation work and report on preliminary results obtained through this strategy.

Herein, we demonstrate a facile process of preparing multiphase phosphides with abundant phosphorus vacancies (P-V) supported on nanoporous Ni(Al). X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) reveal that the as-obtained material has ample P-V induced by the AlP phase. The optimized catalyst also equips with aligned nanoflakes grown in situ on np-Ni(Al) skeletons/ligaments, thereby exposing a large specific surface area for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) in acidic media. Benefitting from its unique hierarchical structure and sufficient P-V, the P-V-np-Ni(Al)-40 electrode displays a low overpotential of 36 mV at a cathodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and an outstanding long-term operational stability for up to 94 h with a slight decay. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that P-V could induce the redistribution of electrons and significantly reduce the Gibbs free energy (Delta G(H*)) of 2P(V)-NiP2 on the P site close to P-V (-0.055 eV). Moreover, the P-V is beneficial for enriching the electronic states nearby the Fermi level, thereby improving the conductivity of NiP2 to achieve superior HER activity.

Successful strategies for both processes have been developed in light-dependent systems. This work explores a dark fermentation bioprocess for H-2 production from water using CO as the electron donor. Results The study of the influence of the stirring and the initial CO partial pressure (p(CO)) demonstrated that the process was inhibited at p(CO) of 1.00 atm. Optimal p(CO) value was established in 0.60 atm. CO dose adaptation to bacterial growth in fed-batch fermentations increased the global rate of H-2 production, yielding 27.2 mmol H-2 l(-1) h(-1) and reduced by 50% the operation time. A kinetic model was proposed to describe the evolution of the molecular species involved in gas and liquid phases in a wide range of p(CO) conditions from 0.10 to 1.00 atm. Conclusions Dark fermentation in R. rubrum expands the ways to produce biohydrogen from CO. This work optimizes this bioprocess at lab-bioreactor scale studying the influence of the stirring speed, the initial CO partial pressure and the operation in batch and fed-batch regimes. Dynamic CO supply adapted to the biomass growth enhances the productivity reached in darkness by other strategies described in the literature, being similar to that obtained under light continuous syngas fermentations. The kinetic model proposed describes all the conditions tested.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1				1754-6834		WOS:000682483700001	34362414

The main aim of this work was to study nanostructured TiO2-RuO2-La2O3 coatings and the effect of electrolyte composition on their stability. For this purpose, coatings with different molar ratios applied on titanium substrate. Then, the morphology and electrochemical properties of the anodes in 0.5 M NaCl and 1 M H2SO4 solutions were studied using field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, potentiostatic polarisation, cyclic voltammetry, and accelerated corrosion test (ACT). The results showed that the morphology of all the coatings was cracked-mud microstructure and cracks with a width of 50-500 nm produced in the coatings. It was also observed that corrosion resistance, stability, and electrocatalytic properties of the anodes improve with increased La2O3 content. Then, the optimum TiO2-RuO2-La2O3 composition is obtained with a molar ratio of 70:15:15. Besides, the lifetime and stability of the anodes in NaCl solution were higher than H2SO4, so that the reduction of active elements in the coating with a molar ratio of 70:15:15 after ACT was obtained about 64.7 and 77.4% of before ACT in NaCl and H2SO4, respectively.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1750-0443			WOS:000461572800003

However, they generally suffer from unsatisfactory energy density due to low specific capacitance arising from inferior conductivity and insufficient ionic diffusion rate. Here a surface modification method is conducted after the annealing of ZIF-67 precursor to produce hydrophilic, porous and heteroatom-doped carbon foam. On top of enhanced area capacitance, widened voltage window of -1.3-0V (vs saturated calomel electrode) can be achieved through electrochemical reduction to suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction. The optimized reduced porous carbon foam on carbon cloth exhibits a maximum area capacitance of 1049 mF/cm(2) at an applied current density of 12 mA/cm(2) with excellent capacitance retention of 98.4% after 6000 charge-discharge cycles at 15 mA/cm(2). By well pairing with hierarchical MnO2/CC cathode, a 2.3 V asymmetric supercapacitor in neutral aqueous Na2SO4 electrolyte is assembled, which delivers an exceptional energy density of up to 10.07 mWh/cm(3). The procedure in this paper for carbonaceous material to simultaneously achieve considerable capacitance and enlarged voltage window can open up a wider prospect toward design of anodes for high-performance aqueous supercapacitor.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000494891700033

We followed the evolution of various stable species as function of the O-2 exposure, and the nature of the ultimately dominating species in the Ti troughs is described. When O-2 saturation was accomplished using a glass-capillary array doser, we found that on-top O (O-ot) adatoms are the predominant surface species. In contrast, when O-2 was supplied via backfilfing of the chamber the predominant surface species are tentatively assigned to terminal OH groups. We argue that unintended reactions with the chamber walls have a strong influence on the formed surface species, explaining scattered results in the literature. On the basis of our STM data we propose an alternative, easy way of preparing oxidized TiO2(110) surfaces with O-ot adatoms (o-TiO2). It is certain that o-TiO2(110) surfaces prepared according to this recipe do not have any residual surface O vacancies. This contradicts the situation when oxidizing reduced TiO2(110) surfaces with O vacancies, where some O vacancies persist. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Herein we propose a new and very promising catalyst: Pt cubes well-dispersed on the porous Cu foam, for the the electrochemical oxidation reaction of glucose in neutral media. The catalyst is fabricated insitu on a homemade screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) substrate through initially synthesizing the three-dimensional (3D) porous Cu foam using a hydrogen evolution assisted electrodeposition strategy, followed by electrochemically reducing the platinic precursor simply and conveniently. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) proofs demonstrate that Pt cubes, with an average size (the distance of opposite faces) of 185.1nm, highly dispersed on the macro/nanopore integrated Cu foam support can be reproducibly obtained. The results of electrochemical tests indicate that the cubic Pt-based catalyst exhibits significant enhancement on the catalytic activity towards the electrooxidation of glucose in the presence of chloride ions, providing a specific activity 6.7 times and a mass activity 5.3 times those of commercial Pt/C catalysts at -0.4V (vs. Ag/AgCl). In addition, the proposed catalyst shows excellent stability of performance, with only a 2.8% loss of electrocatalytic activity after 100 repetitive measurements.									19	0	0	0	2	0	20			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000321431600024	23744705

To obtain a highly efficient electrocatalyst for the glucose oxidation and tiny metal nanocluster catalysts, a calixarene-based {Ni-18} coordination wheel with sulfur atoms on the cavity surface was designed, synthesized, and used as the porous template. Contributing from the active sites of nickel cations, the as-synthesized coordination wheels can efficiently catalyze the electrochemical oxidation of glucose with the onset and peak potentials of 0.3 and 0.46 V in alkaline medium, and the catalysis does not depend on the atmosphere (N-2, air, or O-2), which indicates that the coordination wheel will be a promising electrocatalyst candidate for the compartmentless glucose-air fuel cell. Meanwhile, benefiting from its confined cavity and inner sulfur surface, such a coordination wheel can serve as a general template for the fabrication and encapsulation of tiny metal nanoclusters of Au, Pd, Ir, Ru, Rh, Pt, and AuPd. In electrochemical examinations, the bimetallic AuPd clusters confined in the coordination wheel show higher current density than commercial Pt/C toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The present study shows that the designed coordination wheel can be used as not only a type of novel catalyst itself but also a class of templates for metal cluster catalysts.									62	2	0	0	6	0	63			0002-7863			WOS:000433404000017	29722973

TiO2 NTs were prepared by anodization in HF based electrolyte, after which very short high applied potential, referred to as potential shock, was imposed on the TiO2 NTs in KRuO4 electrolyte. The high potential shock induced massive flow of RuO4- to positively-biased TiO2 NTs, resulting in the incorporation of Ru as a form of Ru, RuO2, and RuO3 in the TiO2 NTs. Optimal potential shock, which allowed the most suitable amount and incorporation state of Ru catalysts in TiO2 NTs, was determined by SEM, TEM, EDS, XPS, and LSV. It was demonstrated that electrochemical potential shock (simply imposed on the anodic TiO2 for a few seconds in the electrolyte of KRuO4) resulted in homogenous incorporation of Ru into the whole nanotubes without the need for any complicated steps or facilities.

Intensities of numerous infrared (IR) bands were used to monitor the temporal evolution of the lowest-energy O-H rotamers (1cTc, 1cTt, 1tTt) of oxalic acid for up to 19 days following near-infrared irradiation of the matrix. The relative energies of these rotamers are 0.0 (1cTc), 2.6 (1cTt), and 4.0 (1tTt) kcal mol(-1). A 1tTt -> 1cTt -> 1cTc isomerization cascade was observed with half-lives (t(1/2)) in different matrix sites ranging from 30 to 360 h, even though the sequential barriers of 9.7 and 10.4 kcal mol(-1) are much too high to be surmounted thermally under cryogenic conditions. A general mathematical model was developed for the complex kinetics of a reaction cascade with species in distinct matrix sites. With this model, a precise, global nonlinear least-squares fit was achieved simultaneously on the temporal profiles of nine IR bands of the 1cTc, 1cTt, and 1tTt rotamers. Classes of both fast (t(1/2) = 30-50 h) and slow (t(1/2) > 250 h) matrix sites were revealed, with the decay rate of the former in close agreement with first-principles computations for the conformational tunneling rates of the corresponding isolated molecules. Rigorous kinetic and theoretical analyses thus show that a domino tunneling mechanism is at work in these oxalic acid transformations.									33	0	0	0	8	0	33			0002-7863			WOS:000357062000051	26027801

In contrast to earlier methods our procedure only requires the pK(a) of an arbitrary acid in water and few simple quantum chemical calculations as input. Thus, it is not affected adversely by experimental shortcomings related to measurements in non-aqueous solvents. By combining this conversion factor with the absolute potential in water, the absolute potential in the solvent of interest is obtained. Based on this procedure a new generalized computational standard hydrogen electrode for the computation of electron transfer and proton-coupled electron transfer potentials in non-aqueous solvents and ionic liquids is developed. This enables for the first time the reliable prediction of redox potentials in any solvent. The method is tested through calculation of absolute potentials in 36 solvents. Using the Kamlet-Taft linear solvation energy model we find that the relative absolute potentials consistently increase with decreasing polarisability and decreasing hydrogen bonding ability. For protic solvents good agreement with literature is observed while significant deviations are found for aprotic solvents. The obtained conversion factors are independent of the quantum chemical method, while minor differences are observed between solvation models. This does, however, not affect the global trends.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000649671500001	33982050

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Raman spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, and a range of electrochemical techniques have been used to characterize the morphology, composition, catalytic water oxidation activity and stability of the films in alkaline solution. SEM images show that films consisting of nanoparticles with diameters of ca. 30 to 40 nm are formed after 40-50 potential cycles of deposition. Nb and Co/Ni are detected in the films by EDX. ICP-MS results show an elemental ratio of 1:1 for Co:Nb and 1:3 for Ni:Nb, respectively. Raman spectra reveal the presence of both [Nb6O19](8) and Co(OH)(2)/Ni(OH)(2). The films exhibit excellent stability and efficiency for electrocatalytic water oxidation in alkaline solution. Turnover frequencies of 12.9 and 13.2 s(-1) were determined by rotating ring disk electrode voltammetry at an overpotential of 480 mV for Co and Ni films, respectively. Fourier transformed large amplitude alternating current (FTAC) voltammetry reveals an additional underlying oxidation process for Co under catalytic turnover conditions, which indicates that a Co-IV species is involved in the efficient catalytic water oxidation reactions. FTAC voltammetric data also suggest that the Ni films undergoes a clear phase transformation upon aging in aqueous 1 M NaOH and the electrogenerated higher oxidation state Ni from beta-NiOOH is the more active form of the catalyst.									27	0	0	0	2	0	27			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000359279800060	26158219

The CeO2/IK-C3N4 composite was then applied for the rapid elimination of acetaminophen (ACT) under 465-nm visible light irradiation in aqueous solutions at different environmental parameters. The electronic images clearly showed that 5 - 20 nm CeO2 can be tightly attached onto IK-C3N4. The charge imbalance of Ce element as well as oxygen vacancy of CeO2/IK-C3N4 enhanced the photocatalytic activity of the composite. Moreover, the optical property and bandgap were easily tuned by changing the CeO2 amounts. At optimum composition of 15 wt% CeO2, the bandgap of CeO2/IK-C3N4 can narrow down to 2.38 eV. The photocatalytic activity of CeO2/IK-C3N4 heterojunction toward ACT degradation is dependent on CeO2 amounts and environmental parameters including pH, anions and initial ACT concentration. The calculated pseudo-first-order rate constants ranged from 0.039 to 0.051 min(-1). The radical species trapping experiments confirmed that O-2(center dot-) and h(+) play significant roles in ACT degradation. Thus, enhanced photodegradation of ACT is explained by type-II heterojunction mechanism. These findings provide a promising strategy of combining CeO2 and doped g-C3N4 for the effective removal of emerging pollutants under visible light irradiation, which can open a new route to synthesize novel heterojunction with high photoactivity for water purification and environmental sustainability.									14	0	0	0	3	0	14			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000661850700001

Within these systems, methanotrophs consume CH4 and act as a potential biofilter mitigating the emission of this potent greenhouse gas. However, it is still not well understood how spatial and temporal variation in environmental parameters influence the abundance, diversity, and community structure of methanotrophs in lakes. To address this gap in knowledge, we collected water samples from three depths (surface, middle, and bottom) representing oxic to suboxic or anoxic zones of five different Swedish lakes in winter (ice-covered) and summer. Methanotroph abundance was determined by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction and a comparison to environmental variables showed that temperature, season as well as depth, phosphate concentration, dissolved oxygen, and CH4 explained the observed variation in methanotroph abundance. Due to minimal differences in methane concentrations (0.19 and 0.29 mu M for summer and winter, respectively), only a weak and even negative correlation was observed between CH4 and methanotrophs, which was possibly due to usage of CH4. Methanotrophs were present at concentrations ranging from 105 to 106 copies/l throughout the oxic (surface) and suboxic/anoxic (bottom) water mass of the lakes, but always contributed less than 1.3% to the total microbial community. Relative methanotroph abundance was significantly higher in winter than in summer and consistently increased with depth in the lakes. Phylogenetic analysis of pmoA genes in two clone libraries from two of the ice-covered lakes (Ekoln and Ramsen) separated the methanotrophs into five distinct clusters of Methylobacter sp. (Type I). Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the pmoA gene further revealed significant differences in methanotrophic communities between lakes as well as between winter and summer while there were no significant differences between water layers. The study provides new insights into diversity, abundance, community composition and spatial as well as temporal distribution of freshwater methanotrophs in low-methane dimictic lakes.									31	4	0	0	29	0	35				1664-302X		WOS:000393373400001	28217121

Our objectives were to analyze mortality and its independent risk factors, and to assess the occurrence of a favorable evolution, defined as hospital discharge, or stay at the ward, or transfer from ICU to ward. Patients were stratified into 4 subgroups: admission to the ward with pneumonia and/or oxygen requirement (WARD; n = 100); ICU admission (ICU; n = 87); ICU admission with requirement of mechanical ventilation (ICU-MV; n = 56), and ICU-MV plus septic shock (ICU-MV-SS; N = 29). Mortality at 28 days was 26.1% for the entire group, 14.0% for WARD group, 18.4% for ICU, 44.6% for ICU-MV, and 55.2% for ICU-MV-SS. Mean survival time (days) was 25.6 +/- 0.6 (WARD); 25.3 +/- 0.7 (ICU); 20.8 +/- 1.2 (ICU-MV) and 18.2 +/- 1.8 (ICU-MV-SS). Independent predictors of mortality were MV, septic shock and weight. A favorable evolution occurred in 81.4% of WARD patients; in 70.9% of ICU; in 39.6% of ICU-MV and in 27.6% of ICU-MV-SS patients. Severity of illness on admission, age, weight and heart rate were independently associated with evolution. No major adverse effects were recorded. The lack of a control group precluded the estimation of efficacy. However, our 26% mortality rate was higher than that of the treatment arm of clinical trials comparing plasma with usual treatment, which might be ascribed to higher proportion of patients with MV and septic shock in our cohort.									5	0	0	0	1	3	6			0025-7680	1669-9106		WOS:000585191500001	33048783

In general, the SIMFCs were fabricated by dry pressing method without high-temperature sintering, thus the preparation pressure is bound to affect the microstructure of electrolyte and electrode and further determine the cell performance. To detect the influence of preparation pressure, SIMFC based on La and Pr co-doped CeO2-Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05LiO2-delta electrolyte was fabricated under different preparation pressure. The evolution of cell microstructure and cell performance with preparation pressure were systematically characterized to obtain the optimal pressure. The characterizations revealed that the increase of preparation pressure gave rise to the enhancement of electrolyte density and the decrease of the electrode porosity, and further brought about the improvement of the gas tightness of the electrolyte membrane and the decrease of three reaction phase area of electrode; the two factors gave the opposite effect to the cell performance and reached a balance at certain preparation pressure. Therefore, the performance of the assembled cell initially increases and then decreases with the increase of preparation pressure, an optimal performance, i.e., a power maximum of 833 mW cm(-2) and open circuit voltage of 1 V, was obtained at 550 degrees C when the preparation pressure is 10 MPa.

In the present study polymorphism in SOD3 gene was identified and their relation with physiological vital parameters like rectal temperature, skin temperature, heart rate, pulse rate and respiration rate alongwith biochemical parameters like serum levels of albumin, bilirubin, total proteins, creatinine, urea, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, asparate aminotransferase (AST) and ALT was estimated during heat stress. Temperature-humidity index (THI) was calculated for different regions and statistical analysis was performed to find out any association of THI with physiological vital parameters and biochemical parameters. The higher value of physiological vital parameters indicated that heat stress may be the most probable cause for such significant difference. The haplotypes were identified after PCR amplification and sequencing of the SOD3 gene. The CGC and CAA haplotypes showed lower values of physiological vital parameters making these haplotypes to be more heat tolerant than others. The study of biochemical parameters revealed the similar results establishing superior heat tolerance capacity in CGC and CAA haplotypes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0929-1016	1744-4179		WOS:000466121600001

Precursors prepared for various cationic ratios of Mg/In=0.35, 0.40, 0.45 and 0.50 were thermally sprayed onto quartz substrates, decomposed at 450 degrees C and the spinel phase evolution was studied. X-ray diffraction, Rutherford backscattering and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies have been conducted to confirm the formation of single-phase MgIn2O4 films with Mg/In ratio 0.50. From optical transmission studies, the observed optical band gaps varied from 3.18 to 3.86 eV (0.35 < Mg/In < 0.5). The electrical conductivity variations of these films were measured in the temperature range between 30 and 150 degrees C by four-probe technique (34.07-1.44x10(-5) S cm(-1)) and the Hall coefficient showed n-type electrical conduction and high carrier concentration (0.16x 10(20)-0.89x (17) cm(-3)).

J	BURNS, RG								RATES AND MECHANISMS OF CHEMICAL-WEATHERING OF FERROMAGNESIAN SILICATE MINERALS ON MARS								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				57	19			4555	4574		10.1016/0016-7037(93)90182-V				OCT 1993	1993	Ferric-bearing assemblages on Mars indicate that oxidative weathering Of surface basalts has occurred during the evolution of the Red Planet. In aqueous environments chemical weathering proceeded through stages of dissolution of Fe2+-bearing silicate and sulfide minerals, oxidation of dissolved Fe2+ to Fe3+ ions, and hydrolysis of dissolved Fe3+ to insoluble ferric-bearing oxide, oxyhydroxide, and hydroxysulphate phases. To determine when these ferrolysis reactions occurred on Mars and to estimate rates of chemical weathering of minerals in Martian surface rocks, experimental data for terrestrial olivines and pyroxenes with compositions resembling assemblages in SNC meteorites are reviewed.Dissolution of ferromagnesian silicates is generally stoichiometric under anoxic conditions. Nonstoichiometric dissolution of pyroxenes may occur initially, both as a result of preferential release of cations in the M2 sites and armoring of crystal surfaces by protective layers of insoluble ferric oxides when dissolution occurs under oxidizing conditions. Dissolution rates of Fe2+ ions decrease in the order: olivine greater-than-or-equal-to pyroxene M2 > pyroxene M1. Dissolution rates of these minerals are highest in acidic solutions, decrease with rising pH and at low temperatures, are least at near-neutral pH, and rise again when pH is in the alkaline range. Since low temperatures currently exist on Mars, dissolution rates of basaltic minerals are probably stoichiometric and extremely slow on the present-day Martian surface, but may have been much faster in the past, especially if acidic groundwater and a more temperate climate prevailed.Ferrous iron released during chemical weathering was metastable with respect to ferric iron when oxygenated groundwater on Mars exceeded pH 3.5. Rates of oxidation of dissolved Fe2+ ions are strongly pH dependent; they are very slow in acidic solutions, in contrast to mineral dissolution rates. Rates of oxidation also decrease with increasing ionic strength and at low temperatures. However, in saline solutions, rates of oxidation eventually increase with rising ionic strength, including brines near eutectic temperatures that have been proposed on Mars. Rates of oxidation of Fe2+ dissolved in slightly acidic brines at -25-degrees-C, for example, are estimated to be about 10(5) times slower than those of Fe2+ occurring in terrestrial river water and bottom ocean water.Ferroan saponites precipitated from cold acidic saline solutions containing dissolved Mg2+, Fe2+, and silica are unstable when exposed to oxygen as a result of intracrystalline redox reactions, such as (Fe2+ +OH-)clay + 1/4O2 = (Fe3+ + O2-)clay + 1/2H2O. The partially dehydroxylated mixed-smectite plus interlayer ferric oxide assemblages that formed during exposure to the Martian atmosphere may account for difficulties in identifying clay silicates in remote-sensed reflectance spectral measurements of Mars due to loss of identifiable hydroxyl groups.Ferrolysis of dissolved Fe2+ ultimately yielded hydrous ferric oxide deposits on Mars, the formation of which was influenced by pH, temperature, ionic strength, ion-pair formation, and the rate of oxidation in Martian groundwater. Deposition rates of hydrous ferric oxides into episodic ocean basins that in the past on Mars were comparable to those that produced terrestrial Precambrian iron-formations. On present-day Mars, dissolved Fe2+ ions may persist indefinitely, particularly in frozen permafrost. However, sublimation and evaporation of day-time equatorial melt-waters may cause localized oxidation of dissolved Fe2+ ions, leading to the precipitation of nanophase ferric-bearing oxides, hydroxysulfate and partially dehydroxylated clay silicate assemblages that litter bright regions on the surface of Mars.									155	0	0	0	8	0	155			0016-7037	1872-9533		WOS:A1993MD26500002

For the most popular metal-N-x(MNx) structure, the replacement of N atoms by some other atoms with relatively weak electronegativity has been regarded as a promising strategy for optimizing the coordination environment of an active metal center and promoting its catalytic performance, which is still a challenge. Herein, we proposed a new synthetic strategy of an in situ phosphatizing of triphenylphosphine encapsulated within metal-organic frameworks for designing atomic Co-1-P1N3 interfacial structure, where a cobalt single atom is costabilized by one P atom and three N atoms (denoted as Co-SA/P-in situ). In the acidic media, the Co-SA/P-in situ catalyst with Co-x-P1N3 interfacial structure exhibits excellent activity and durability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a low overpotential of 98 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 47 mV dec(-1), which are greatly superior to those of catalyst with Co-1-N-4 interfacial structure. We discover that the bond-length-extended high-valence Co-x-P1N3 atomic interface structure plays a crucial role in boosting the HER performance, which is supported by in situ X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. We hope this work will promote the development of high performance metal single-atom catalysts.									136	4	0	0	15	0	137			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000535173500043	32302111

At present, the commonly used methods to probe TM redox are hard X-ray absorption spectroscopy (hXAS) and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS). However, they are both facing challenges to precisely quantify the valence states of some transition metals such as Mn. In this paper, Mn-L iPFY (inverse partial fluorescence yield) spectra extracted from Mn-L mRIXS (mapping of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering) is adopted to quantify Mn valence states. Mn-L iPFY spectra has been considered as a bulk-sensitive, non-distorted probe of TM valence states. However, the exact precision of this method is still unclear in quantifying practical battery electrodes. Herein, a series of LiMn2O4 electrodes with different charge and discharge states are prepared. Based on their electrochemical capacity (generally considered to be very precise), the precision of Mn iPFY in quantifying bulk Mn valence state is confirmed, and the error range is unraveled. Mn-L mRIXS iPFY thus is identified as one of the best methods to quantify the bulk Mn valence state comparing with hXAS and sXAS.

Nonheme iron enzymes, superoxide reductase (SOR) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), detoxify O-2(center dot-) via reduction to afford H2O2 and disproportionation to afford O-2 and H2O2, respectively. The former contains a thiolate in the coordination sphere, which has been proposed to prevent O-2(center dot-) oxidation to O-2. The work described herein shows that, in contrast to this, oxidized thiolateligated [Fe-III(SMe2N4(tren)(THF)](2+) (1(ox)-THF) is capable of oxidizing O-2(center dot-) to O-2. Coordinating anions, Cl- and OAc-, are shown to inhibit dioxygen evolution, implicating an inner-sphere mechanism. Previously we showed that the reduced thiolate-ligated [Fe-II(SMe2N4(tren))](+) (1) is capable of reducing O-2(center dot-) via a proton-dependent inner-sphere mechanism involving a transient Fe(III)-OOH intermediate. A transient ferric-superoxo intermediate, [Fe-III(SMe2N4(tren))(O-2)](+) (3), is detected by electronic absorption spectroscopy at -130 degrees C in the reaction between 1(ox)-THF and KO2 and shown to evolve O-2 upon slight warming to -115 degrees C. The DFT calculated O-O (1.306 angstrom) and Fe-O (1.943 angstrom) bond lengths of 3 are typical of ferric-superoxo complexes, and the time-dependent DFT calculated electronic absorption spectrum of 3 reproduces the experimental spectrum. The electronic structure of 3 is shown to consist of two antiferromagnetically coupled (J(calc) = -180 cm(-1)) unpaired electrons, one in a superoxo pi*(O-O) orbital and the other in an antibonding p*(Fe(d(yz))-S(p(y))) orbital.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000653539100047	33900756

This technique is very useful and advantageous when the ternary oxides contain an alkaline earth element. The selected compositions for this method are BaCeO3 (BC), BaBiO3 (BB), La0.7Sr0.3CoO3 (LSCO) and BaBi2Nb2O9 (BBN). Commercially purchased strontium (or barium) hydroxide and freshly prepared lanthanum, cobalt, bismuth and niobium hydroxides were mixed thoroughly in stoichiometric ratio and heated at different temperatures ranging from 100 to 700 degrees C for 10 h for corresponding compositions. The sequence of the reaction and evolution of the product phase were studied by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. The phase purity and lattice parameters were also determined by XRD investigations. All the product phases in each case were formed at relatively low temperature than when they were prepared by co-precipitation or solid state method. The morphology and average particle size of these powders were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, compared with traditional 3D nano-materials, 2D nanosheets possess a greater specific surface area and shorter electron transport distance. In this study, a reasonable approach is proposed for the synthesis of ZIF-67 nanosheets on nickel foam with subsequent phosphorization by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to obtain flake-like CoP combined with Ni2P (NCP/NF), in which nickel foam serves as the current collector as well as the resource of Ni to form Ni2P. Benefiting from the nanosheet array of CoP, the NCP/NF can improve the capacity of Ni2P from 0.57 C cm(-2) to 1.43 C cm(-2) at 1 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the NPC/NF/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) shows an energy density of 26.9 mu W h cm(-2) at a power density of 0.896 mW cm(-2), and excellent cycling performance with a capacity retention of 93.75% after 5000 cycles at 10 mA cm(-2).									33	0	0	0	3	0	33			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000581650100013	33029601

The white-tip nematode Aphelenchoides besseyi can survive in adverse environments including high temperature, osmosis and oxidative stresses. To reveal the antioxidant function of Grx in A. besseyi, 【Method】herein the full-length cDNA of glutaredoxin(named AbGrx-1) from A. besseyi was cloned by using rapid amplification of cDNA ends(RACE), and AbGrx-1 protein and evolutionary relationship were characterized; differential gene expression level was detected in the nematodes under oxidant and temperature stresses by using quantitative real-time PCR; the effect of the recombinant AbGrx-1 protein on A.besseyi survival was also tested. 【Result】The full-length AbGrx-1 cDNA contains a 5' UTR of 90, an ORF of 321 bp encoding a polypeptide of 106 amino acids and a 3' UTR of 97 bp. The deduced amino acid sequence of AbGrx-1 shares a high similarity with other nematodes' Grxs, and the catalytic residue(CPYC) and glutathione binding sites(RSVP and GGDD) indicate that AbGrx-1 is categorized into Class I Grx. The phylogenetic tree showed AbGrx-1 is located in the same clade with the plant parasitic nematode Aphelenchus avenae. AbGrx-1 mRNA is highly induced in A. besseyi exposed to H_2O_2 solution and 12℃, but is suppressed in the nematodes at 0, 4, 37 and 45℃. The high concentration H_2O_2 solutions and high temperature are adverse to survival of A. besseyi, but the survival rate increases with the nematodes pre-soaked in AbGrx-1 recombinant protein solution. 【Conclusion】AbGrx-1 is required for A. besseyi antioxidative immunity, and plays an essential role in overcoming oxidative damage and nematode survival.			【目的】谷氧还蛋白(glutaredoxin, Grx)作为一种抗氧化酶,在通过清除多余活性氧来维持生物细胞氧化还原平衡、降低细胞膜损伤过程中发挥重要作用。水稻干尖线虫(Aphelenchoides besseyi)能在高温、渗透及氧化胁迫等多种逆境压力中存活。本研究旨在探究Grx在水稻干尖线虫抗氧化胁迫中的作用。【方法】通过cDNA末端快速扩增技术(rapid amplification of cDNA ends, RACE),获得了一个水稻干尖线虫谷氧还蛋白基因AbGrx-1,进行了序列比对和遗传进化分析;通过qRT-PCR检测了AbGrx-1在线虫响应氧化和温度胁迫中的表达差异,通过原核表达获得了AbGrx-1的重组蛋白,并分析了AbGrx-1蛋白浸泡对水稻干尖线虫在氧化和高温胁迫下存活的影响。 【结果】AbGrx-1基因全长包括90 bp的5'非翻译区(UTR)、321 bp的编码区和97 bp的3'UTR,开发阅读框(横跨91至411位)编码106个氨基酸。AbGrx-1蛋白的第24至27位点具有谷氧还蛋白催化残基(CPYC),分别在第69至第72和第83至第86位点存在保守的谷胱甘肽结合位点RSVP和GGDD,归为Ⅰ类谷氧还蛋白。遗传进化树显示AbGrx-1与燕麦真滑刃线虫(Aphelenchus avenae)Grx亲缘关系最近,位于同一进化分支。AbGrx-1在H_2O_2处理和12℃下时显著上调表达,但在0℃, 4℃, 37℃和45℃极端温度中下调表达。高浓度H_2O_2和高温导致水稻干尖线虫死亡率增加,AbGrx-1重组蛋白能显著提高暴露于高浓度H_2O_2中线虫的存活率,但不影响高温下线虫的存活率。【结论】AbGrx-1参与调控水稻干尖线虫的抗氧化免疫反应,在抵抗氧化损伤、维持线虫生存方面具有重要功能。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1001-7216			CSCD:6612481

Herein, topological defect-rich graphene (TDG) based materials are developed as metal-free cathodes for Li-CO2 batteries, presenting an unprecedented full discharge capacity of over 69 000 mA h g(-1) at the current density of 0.5 A g(-1), a relatively small voltage gap of 1.87 V (Li/Li+) even at an extremely high current density of 2.0 A g(-1), and an excellent long-term stable cycle life of up to 600 cycles at 1.0 A g(-1). The outstanding performance of Li-CO2 batteries with the TDG cathodic electrocatalyst can be attributed to the introduction of topological defects in the carbon skeleton, providing sufficient active sites for CO2 reduction and evolution to facilitate the formation/decomposition of Li2CO3 during the discharging/charging process. The density functional theory calculations reveal the superiority of the negatively charged C atoms in topological defects as the adsorption for CO2 molecules and the activation sites for the decomposition of Li2CO3, and that the heterocyclic pentagon ring (C5) has a relatively low theoretical potential gap (1.01 V) during the charge and discharge processes.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000664477000001

In recent years, zero-valent aluminum (ZVAl) is highly reductive but limited by its surface passivation film. One of the effective ways to overcome this bottleneck is to add ligands. In this paper, compared with several other ligands, sodium citrate (SC), a natural organic ligand, was introduced to enhance microscale ZVAl (mZVAl) reactivity for the reductive degradation of CT. The results showed that the SC system could effectively reduce but not completely dechlorinate CT and electron utilization efficiency was as high as 94%. However, without ligands, mZVAl is chemically inert for CT degradation. Through SEM-EDS, BET, XRD, and XPS characterizations and H-2 evolution experiments, enhanced mZVAl surface corrosion at the solid-liquid interface of mZVAl/SC system was verified. SC participated in the complexation corrosion reaction with surface inert film to form Al[Cit] complex, which made internal Al-0 active sites exposed and then promoted mZVAl corrosion. In the five consecutive reuse experiments of mZVAl, CT can be completely degraded, which indicates that mZVAl, with the help of SC, has excellent sustainable utilization efficiency.

Mn-doped MgAl2O4 nanoparticles, synthesized by coprecipitation method, showed increased surface area when contrasted to undoped MgAl2O4. Fast firing of compacted-doped nanoparticles achieved high degree of densification at temperatures as low as 1100 degrees C with very moderate grain growth, resulting in average sizes at the nanoscale (similar to 60 nm). Differential scanning calorimetry was used to quantify the exothermic heat effects of sintering, which combined with quantitative microstructural evolution analysis enabled calculation of both surface and grain boundary energies. The results revealed that Mn effectively reduces the surface and grain boundary energies which led to dihedral angle broadening and consequently increased sintering stress. Experimental data also revealed a concomitant decrease in the activation energy of sintering with Mn doping which dropped from 644 kJ/mol for undoped MgAl2O4 to 285 kJ/mol, informing Mn acts as a sintering aid in a thermokinetic manner.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000530515800001		
J	Ma, Liu-Bo; Liang, Kuang; Wang, Gang; Fang, Xiao-Xiang; Ling, Cong; Zhao, Tan; Kombo, Miza; Cheang, Tuck-Yun; Xu, An-Wu								Mechanistic insights into N-hydroxyphthalimide modified graphitic carbon nitride boosted photocatalytic hydrogen production Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Additional experimental section, TEM images, cyclic voltammogram, comparison of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates under different sacrificial reagents, etc. See DOI: ; 10.1039/c9cy01340g								CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				9	19			5441	5446		10.1039/c9cy01340g				OCT 7 2019	2019	Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is considered as an attractive and appropriate material to split water and produce hydrogen (H-2) under visible light. Nevertheless, the H-2 evolution rate of g-C3N4 is low due to the rapid recombination of electron-hole pairs. In this context, we develop a novel g-C3N4 system combined with N-hydroxyphthalimide (denoted as NHPI) through pi-pi interactions and hydrogen bonds at the interface for circumventing this issue. NHPI conjugated small molecules act as an efficient hole mediator to reduce the recombination of electron-hole pairs and enhance the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4. Under visible light excitation, the redox couple NHPI/NHPI+ serves as a redox shuttle, which can facilitate the transfer of holes from g-C3N4 to triethanolamine (TEOA), and the electrons can be shuttled to a Pt cocatalyst. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), photoelectrochemical (PEC) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements exhibit that the introduction of NHPI on g-C3N4 boosts the visible-light photocatalytic activity through accelerating spatial separation of the electron-hole pairs. Upon introducing optimal 2 wt% NHPI, the photocatalytic H-2 production rate of the g-C3N4/2 wt% NHPI (CN/2 wt% NHPI) composite is significantly enhanced up to 1145.4 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), exceeding that of pristine g-C3N4 (274.0 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) by 4.2 times. Moreover, the reusability test shows that no obvious loss of activity is observed over the CN/2 wt% NHPI sample. Overall, an excellent stable and highly efficient photocatalyst of the CN/NHPI heterostructure has been obtained, which could find potential application in solar-to-fuel conversion.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000496289200019

Hence, this study proposed a new strategy for electron transfer regulation to facilitate redox cycle of Cu(II)/Cu(I). The objective was achieved by successful construction of copper-containing covalent bond through the in situ growth of porous g-C3N4 with oxygen dopants and nitrogen defects (O-CND) on CuAlxOy substrate (CuAl@O-CND). On the basis of X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and other characterization results, the facilitated redox behavior of copper species by electron transfer regulation was ascribed to the formation of a C-O-Cu bond on the porous-rich superficial of the catalyst; these covalent C-O-Cu bonds shortened the migration distance of electrons between Cu(II) and Cu(I) via Cu(I)-O-C-O-Cu(II) bridge. The construction of copper-containing covalent bonds in the catalyst resulted in efficient PMS activation for a rapid redox cycle of Cu(II)/Cu(I), triggering a series of reactions involving the continuous production of three highly active species (SO4 center dot-, (OH)-O-center dot and O-1(2)). The rapid diffusion and transportation of the generated active species from porous structures directly attack typical pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs), achieving superior catalytic performance. This study provides a new routine to construct a C-O-Cu bond for PMS activation by regulating the electron transfer to accelerate the redox behavior of copper species for environmental remediation.									17	1	0	0	8	0	18			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000575557800035	32857501

Zn- and Pb-based catalysts have improved formate selectivity, but they suffer from relatively low current activities considering the competitive CO selectivity on Zn. Here, lead-doped zinc (Zn(Pb)) electrocatalyst is optimized to efficiently reduce CO2 to formate, while CO evolution selectivity is largely controlled. Selective formate is detected with Faradaic efficiency (FEHCOOH) of approximate to 95% at an outstanding partial current density of 47 mA cm(-2) in a conventional H-Cell. Zn(Pb) is further investigated in an electrolyte-fed device achieving a superior conversion rate of approximate to 100 mA cm(-2) representing a step closer to practical electrocatalysis. The in situ analysis demonstrates that the Pb incorporation plays a crucial role in CO suppression stem from the generation of the Pb-O-C-O-Zn structure rather than the CO-boosted Pb-O-C-Zn. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the alloying effect tunes the adsorption energetics and consequently modifies the electronic structure of the system for an optimized asymmetric oxo-bridged intermediate. The alloying effect between Zn and Pb controls CO selectivity and achieves a superior activity for a selective CO2-to-formate reduction.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6				2198-3844		WOS:000716808300001	34761550

The rate of animal energy metabolism can influence their susceptibility to pesticides by influencing food consumption, biotransformation and elimination rates of toxicants. We used experimental evolution to study the effects of inherent differences in energy metabolism rate and exposure to the organophosphate insecticide, chlorpyrifos (CPF) on thermogenic capacity in a wild rodent, the bank vole (Myodes = Clethrionomys glareolus). The voles were sampled from four replicate lines selected for high swim-induced aerobic metabolism (A) and four unselected control (C) lines. Thermogenic capacity, measured as the maximum cold-induced rate of oxygen consumption (VO(2)cold), was higher in the A than C lines, and it decreased after continuous exposure to CPF via food or after a single dose administered via oral gavage, but only when measured shortly after exposure. VO(2)cold measured 24 h after repeated exposure was not affected. In addition, gavage with a single dose led to decreased food consumption and loss in body mass. Importantly, the adverse effects of CPF did not differ between the selected and control lines.Therefore, exposure to CPF has adverse effects on thermoregulatory performance and energy balance in this species. The effects are short-lived and their magnitude is not associated with the inherent level of energy metabolism. Even without severe symptoms of poisoning, fitness can be compromised under harsh environmental conditions, such as cold and wet weather.

Incorporation of nitrogen into the layer perovskite structure was confirmed by XPS, combustion analysis, and MAS NMR. The water content was determined by thermal gravimetric analysis and the rubidium content by ICP-MS. A similar layered perovskite interconversion occurred in the two-layer Dion-Jacobson oxide RbLaNb2O7 to yield Rb1-xLaNb2O7-(x)N(x)(.)yH(2)O (x = 0.7-0.8, y = 0.5-1.0). Both compounds were air- and moisture-sensitive, with rapid loss of nitrogen by oxidation and hydrolysis reactions. The structure of the three-layer oxynitride Rb(1.7)Ca(2)Nb(3)O(9.3)N(0.7)(-)0.5H(2)O was solved in space group P4/mmm with a = 3.887(3) and c = 18.65(1) angstrom, by Rietveld refinement of X-ray powder diffraction data. The two-layer oxynitride structure Rb(1.8)LaNb(2)O(6.3)N(0.7)(.)1.0H(2)O was also determined in space group P4/mmm with a = 3.934(2) and c = 14.697(2) angstrom. GSAS refinement of synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction data showed that the water molecules were intercalated between a double layer of Rb+ ions in both the two- and three-layer Ruddlesden-Popper structures. Optical band gaps were measured by diffuse reflectance UV-vis for both materials. An indirect band gap of 2.51 eV and a direct band gap of 2.99 eV were found for the three-layer compound. while an indirect band gap of 2.29 eV and a direct band gap of 2.84 eV were measured for the two-layer compound. Photocatalytic activity tests of the three-layer compound under 380 nm pass filtered light with AgNO3 as a sacrificial electron acceptor gave a quantum yield of 0.025% for oxygen evolution.

J	Jang, Eun-Suk; Ryu, Do-Yoon; Kim, Daegi								Hydrothermal carbonization improves the quality of biochar derived from livestock manure by removing inorganic matter								CHEMOSPHERE				305						135391	10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.135391				OCT 2022	2022	The application of hydrothermal carbonization to improve biomass-derived energy sources is crucial because of insufficient supplies of fossil fuels and concerns associated with the impact of fossil fuels on the environment. Hydrothermal carbonization technology has been developed to circumvent the energy-intensive drying step required for the thermal conversion of high-moisture organic feedstocks into fuel. In this study, the quality of livestock manure was upgraded, and its energy density was increased through hydrothermal carbonization at various temperatures. The evolution of waste biomass under hydrothermal carbonization was chemically analyzed. The increased carbon content of the resulting biochar upgraded its fuel properties, leading to energy savings in the treatment process. After hydrothermal carbonization, the H/C and O/C ratios were lower owing to chemical conversion. The optimal temperature for hydrothermal carbonization was approximately 220 ?. The inorganic content resulted in a lowered degree of agglomeration and reduced the likelihood of fouling during combustion. The thermogravimatric analysis also provided the changing combustion characteristics due to the increased fixed carbon content. Fourier transform infrared spectra revealed that hydrothermal carbonization reaction reduced the numbers of C-O and C-H functional groups and increased the number of aromatic C-H functional groups. The equilibrium moisture content decreased rapidly when hydrothermal carbonization was conducted at temperatures higher than 200 ?, and the initial moisture content was reduced by 75% after hydrothermal carbonization at 300 ?.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0045-6535	1879-1298		WOS:000822551900007	35732205

The alpha-Fe2O3 film morphology can be tuned from nanoparticle - based patterns to high-density cabbage-like structures as Co - Pi deposition time is increased.Systematic studies were performed to clarify the mechanisms that enhance water-splitting performance of alpha-Fe2O3 electrodes as Co -Pi deposition time increases. All samples followed morphological and structural studies using field-emission scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Chronoamperometry measurements showed that Co - Pi/alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode exhibited higher photoelectrochemical activity than the alpha-Fe2O3 films. The maximum photocurrent density and incident photon conversion efficiencies (IPCE) were obtained for 30 s Co-Pi/alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode. All samples reached their best IPCE at 400 nm. IPCE values for 30 s Co - Pi hematite films were 5 times higher than that of alpha-Fe2O3 sample. For the alpha-Fe(2)O(3 )photoanode, the H-2 evolution rate was similar to 5.14 mu mol cm(-2) h(-1). After decoration by Co - Pi, the rate increases to similar to 7.31 mu mol cm(-2) h(-1), showing an enhancement of about similar to 42.2%. It was found that under illumination, the Co - Pi catalyst can efficiently collect and store photogenerated holes from the alpha-Fe2O3 electrode. This charge separation reduces surface state recombination, leading to the enhancement of the efficiency of water oxidation. Thicker catalytic Co - Pi films were found to increase charge separation and surface area, which in turn increase water oxidation efficiency. These results provide important new understanding of the catalytic enhancement and limitations of the Co - Pi catalyst once coupled to semiconductor electrodes for water-splitting applications.									7	2	0	0	1	0	7			0927-0248	1879-3398		WOS:000466454600029		
J	Anantharaju, A; Feller, A; Chedid, A								Aging liver								GERONTOLOGY				48	6			343	353		10.1159/000065506				NOV-DEC 2002	2002	Aging is characterized by a progressive decline of cellular functions. The aging liver appears to preserve its function relatively well. Aging is associated in human liver with morphological changes such as decrease in size attributable to decreased hepatic blood flow. Ultrastructural analysis of the human liver has revealed that the integrity of mitochondria and enzymatic activity remain mostly unchanged with aging. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the aging process and result mainly from nonenzymatic processes in the liver. Endogenous free radicals are generated within mitochondria and suspected to cause severe injury to mitochondrial DNA. This damaged DNA accumulates with aging. In addition, polyunsaturated fatty acids, highly sensitive to ROS, decrease in liver mitochondria from human centenarians, a feature acquired during evolution as a protective mechanism to favor longevity. Diet is considered the main environmental factor having effect on lifespan. It has a major impact on aging liver, the central metabolic organ of the body. The ubiquitin proteolytic pathway in the liver serves to destroy many proteins, among them p21 which is encoded by abundant mRNA in senescent cells, can inhibit cell proliferation and favors DNA repair. Drug therapy in the elderly may be complicated by several factors such as decline in body weight, renal function, liver mass and hepatic blood flow, making adverse drug reactions more frequent. Hepatic drug metabolism is mainly mediated by the cytochrome P-450 system and drug interactions in the elderly are likely related to the progressive decline of this system after the fifth decade of life and another decrease in individuals aged >70. Anti hypertensive therapy in the elderly depends upon either hepatic or renal function and should be adjusted accordingly. Finally, telomerases are the biological clocks of replicative lifespan. Shortening of telomeric ends of chromosomes correlates with aging and decline in the replicative potential of the cell: replicative senescence. Telomere DNA of human somatic cells shortens during each cell division thus leading to a finite proliferation. Transfection of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene results in elongation of telomeres and extension of lifespan. This also applies to humans. Replicative senescence in human cells evolved as a mechanism to protect them from continuous divisions leading to multipie mutations. Longer-lived species such as humans had to develop replicative senescence to ensure that they would have the increased protection that their longevity necessitates. Copyright (C) 2002 S.

Here, the cDNA of Chinese sturgeon (Acipenser sinensis) GILT (CsGILT) was cloned. It contained an open reading frame of 762 nucleotides encoding a protein of 254 amino acids with an estimated molecular weight of 28.1 kDa. The characteristic structural features, including a signature sequence CQHGX2ECX2NX4C, a CXXC motif, two potential N-glycosylation sites, and eight conserved cysteines were detected in the deduced amino acid sequence of CsGILT. CsGILT was widely expressed in Chinese sturgeon with the highest expression in the spleen, and CsGILT mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated when Chinese sturgeons were challenged with polyinosinic polycytidylic acid or Vibrio anguillarum. The recombinant CsGILT displayed obvious thiol reductase activity demonstrated by catalyzing the reduction of mouse IgG(H +L) by dithiothreitol into heavy chain and light chain. CsGILT also displayed significant antioxidant activity in mouse dentritic cells as indicated by its increasing GSH level and GSH/GSSG ratio, decreasing intracellular reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide levels and lipid peroxidation, as well as enhancing the activities of the anti oxidative redox enzymes including catalase and superoxide dismutase. Our results suggested an important role for CsGILT in the immune response in Chinese sturgeon to pathogen invasion possibly via,a conserved functional mechanism throughout vertebrate evolution, contributing to our understanding the immune biology and protection of Chinese sturgeon.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000423644600042	29133251

Microwave irradiation has been used to synthesize numerous organic and inorganic materials; however, it is rarely used to synthesize iridium based electrocatalysts for polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolysis: In this work, an electrocatalyst consisting of a complex iridium oxide supported on antimony tin oxide (ATO) was synthesized using a polyol method with two different heating methods: conventional heating and microwave irradiation heating. With microwave heating the primary synthesis step could be completed in 1 min compared to more than 10 h for conventional heating. The morphological and electrochemical properties of the two catalysts were then compared using various characterization techniques. Their BET surface area, particle size/particle size distribution, and elemental compositions were measured using nitrogen physisorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX). Their electrochemical characteristics were studied using linear sweep and cyclic voltammetry in a three-electrode cell. Additionally, using the microwave irradiation heating method, the effect of various operating parameters such as pH, metal precursor concentration, temperature and the type of polyol on the morphology of the catalyst was studied. The results showed that the catalysts synthesized with both of the heating techniques have comparable physical and electrochemical properties. However, the clusters of iridium species in the conventional heating method were slightly smaller compared to those in the microwave irradiation heating method (2.30 +/- 0.04 nm compared to 3.00 +/- 0.03 nm).Among the operating parameters tested, the pH of the synthesis solution and the type of polyol were two factors to influence the surface area of the iridium based species the most, each resulted in an increase of approximately 12%.

The model by Y. L. Yung ct al, (1988, Icarus 76, 146-159) for deuterium fractionation in chemical reactions on Mars corrected for this factor results in (HD/H-2)/(HDO/H2O) = 0,43, This value may fit the deuterium abundance observed by V,A, Krasnopolsky Et al, (1998, Science 280, 1576-1580) if the eddy diffusion coefficient does not depend on solar activity: K = 1,4 x 10(13)n(-1/2) cm(2) s(-1) (model 2), The Mariner 9 observations show very low variability of atomic oxygen at the 1.2 n bar pressure level (h similar to 125 km) with solar activity. This requires eddy diffusion to be proportional to the solar activity index F(10.7)cm: K = (F-10.7cm/30) X 10(13)n(-1/2) cm(2) s(-1) (model 1), The fractionation factor for escape of hydrogen isotopes is equal to 0.016 and 0.135 for models 1 and 2, These values have been averaged over the solar cycle. The three-reservoir model for hydrogen isotope fractionation suggested by Krasnopolsky ct al, (1998) involves a reservoir composed primarily of water ice in the polar caps that isotopically interacts with the atmosphere. Assuming that water ice is half of the total volume of the polar caps and the polar-layered deposits, the total loss of water from Mars is equal to 65 and 120 m for models 1 and 2, respectively. Along with thermal and nonthermal escape, these values may include the loss of water by oxidation of regolith, if the released hydrogen escaped with isotopic fractionation, Although the solar-wind ct particles are the main source of He on Mars, capture of the solar-wind H+ and D+ ions by Mars has a negligible effect on the thermospheric abundances of H and D. Improved observations of minor components in Mars' thermosphere may resolve the problem of eddy diffusion at various solar activity and choosing between the models.

These zones vary from very light gray (gray) to pinkish white (pink) to very pale yellow (cream) (Munsell INS, 5YR 8/2 and 2.5Y 8/2, respectively) with increasing degree of oxidation. A representative sample from each zone was collected and analyzed for its chemical, crystallographic and Raman spectroscopic properties. The comparison of these genetically related samples allowed for a quantitatively accurate assessment of anatase's contribution to the total TiO2 content. All samples contain similar to1.5 wt.%, TiO2. Progressing from gray to Pink to cream, anatase contents range from half to nearly all the TiO2 The a lattice parameter for anatase is constant in all three kaolins (3.7916 Angstrom), Suggesting a constant 4.6 mol.% isomorphous substitution of Fe for Ti.Phase characterization and mass-balance considerations of the gray, pink and cream kaolins indicate that ilmenite and pyrite are precursor Ti- and Fe-bearing phases in the gray kaolin that undergo oxidation. Pseudorutile is a proposed intermediate phase resulting from the anodic corrosion of ilmenite. Hematite, goethite and anatase are the dominant end-products via dissolution-precipitation from the reactants pyrite and pseudorutile. The removal of Fe sulfides and organic matter and addition of hematite and goethite causes kaolin colors to change from gray to pink. Oxygen diffusing from groundwater in permeable overlying and underlying formations facilitates a process that probably involves aerobic and anaerobic bacteria that utilize Fe from pyrite, hematite and goethite. We Postulate that the end result is the mobilization of Fe by siderophores and a kaolin color change from pink to cream.									32	0	0	0	6	0	32			0009-8604	1552-8367		WOS:000220909900007

The biogeochemistry of nitrogen in epeiric seas was particularly susceptible to alteration because of its dependence upon the series of redox-mediated reactions that comprise the marine N cycle. In order to explore the impact of climate change on N biogeochemistry in a Late Devonian epeiric sea, we sampled a core from the Appalachian Basin that spans the interval from the greenhouse climate at the base of the Famennian period to glacial conditions near its conclusion. Based upon stable isotope analysis of N, C, and S as well as elemental analysis of N, C, P, S, and Fe, we contend that two distinct biogeochemical regimes obtained during the contrasting climates. The greenhouse regime featured low seawater O-2 and pH that served to significantly curtail the oxidation of ammonia - i.e. nitrification - resulting in an ammonium-dominated water column and low sediment delta N-15 values. The greenhouse also featured more extensive recycling of C, N, and P. In contrast, the higher seawater O-2 and pH of the icehouse regime permitted nitrification in the water column resulting in a nitrate-dominated system and higher sediment delta N-15 values. We conclude that nitrification was the key component of the N cycle that differentiated the two climate/biogeochemical regimes.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0031-0182	1872-616X		WOS:000483645600008

Furthermore, the layered crystal structure of MoO3 is suited to nanostructuring, which can be adapted to enhance the film properties. Here, we present a simple, aqueous route to MoO3 thin films and attain nanostructured morphologies by control of solution parameters. Smooth and homogeneous thin films were achieved by control of the molecular species in solution by pH. The sensitivity of film quality to pH was demonstrated with the addition of PVA to the solution, which resulted in large spherical particulates on the surface. Film thickness was adjusted from 10 to 60 nm, whilst maintaining good film quality, by changing the solution concentration. Moreover, the grain size and nanocrystallite orientation varied with solution concentration. The importance of film morphology is revealed in the compositional changes of the films during hydrogen reduction, with differences in breakdown of film coverage and growth of reduced phases. Furthermore, spectroscopic ellipsometry was used to determine the optical properties of the films. This revealed changes in the dielectric function and band gap that were dependent on the level of reduction. The nanoscale morphologies presented demonstrate the potential to precisely control film morphology, dimensions, oxygen stoichiometry and phase composition by a low-cost wet chemical route.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000444600300102

Few studies have considered the change in phenotypic flexibility among geographic populations in marine calcifiers to ocean acidification projections, despite the fact that this type of study provides understanding about how the organism may respond to this chemical change in the ocean. We examined the geographic variation in CO2 seawater concentrations in the phenotype and in the reaction norm of physiological traits using a laboratory mesocosm approach with short-term acclimation in two contrasting populations (Antofagasta and Calfuco) of the intertidal snail Concholepas concholepas. Our results show that elevated pCO(2) conditions increase standard metabolic rates in both populations of the snail juveniles, likely due to the higher energy cost of homeostasis. juveniles of C concholepas in the Calfuco (southern) population showed a lower increment of metabolic rate in high-pCO(2) environments concordant with a lesser gene expression of a heat shock protein with respect to the Antofagasta (northern) population. Combined these results indicate a negative effect of ocean acidification on whole-organism functioning of C. concholepas. Finally, the significant Population x pCO(2) level interaction in both studied traits indicates that there is variation between populations in response to high-pCO(2) conditions.

J	Soriano, GM; Ponamarev, MV; Tae, GS; Cramer, WA								Effect of the interdomain basic region of cytochrome f on its redox reactions in vivo								BIOCHEMISTRY				35	46			14590	14598		10.1021/bi9616211				NOV 19 1996	1996	The prominent interdomain basic surface region seen in the high-resolution structure of the active lumen-side C-terminal fragment of turnip cytochrome f, containing the conserved Lys58,65,66 (large domain) and Lys187 (small domain), has been inferred from in vitro studies to bt responsible for docking of its physiological oxidant, plastocyanin. The effect of the putative docking region of cyt f on its reactivity in vivo was tested by site-directed mutagenesis in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Three charge-neutralizing mutants were constructed involving: (i) the two lysines (Lys188Asn-Lys189Gln) in the small domain, (ii) the three lysines (Lys58Gln-Lys65Ser-Lys66Glu) in the large domain, and (iii) all five of these lysines spanning both domains. All mutants grew phototrophically. The mutants displayed a 20-30% increase in average generation time, and comparable decreases in rates of steady-state oxygen evolution and the slow (millisecond) electrochromic 515 nm band shift, The magnitude of the changes was greatests in the 5-fold Lys-minus mutant (Lys58Gln-Lys65Ser-Lys66Glu-Lys188Asn-Lys189Gln). The mutants showed a small increase (similar to 25%) in the t(1/2), from 0.2 to 0.25 ms, of cyt f photooxidation, far less than anticipated (ca. 100-fold) from in vitro studies of the effect of high ionic strength on the cyt f-PC interaction. The t(1/2) of cyt f dark reduction via the Rieske protein increased from 5-6 ms in the wild type to 11-12 ms in the 5-fold Lys-minus mutant. Cells grown phototrophically in the absence of Cu, where cyt c(6) is the electron acceptor of cyt f; displayed net rates of cytochrome photooxidation that were slightly faster than those in the presence of Cu, which also decreased by a factor of less than or equal to 25% in the Lys-minus mutants. II was concluded that (a) the net effect of electrostatic interaction between cytochrome Sand its electron acceptor ii? vivo is much smaller than measured in vitro and is not rate-limiting, This may be a consequence of a relatively high ionic strength environment and the small diffusional space available for collision and docking in the internal thylakoid lumen of log phase C, reinhardtii. (b) The efficiency of electron transfer to cytochrome f from the Rieske protein is slightly impaired by the neutralization of the lysine-rich domain.									79	0	0	0	67	0	79			0006-2960			WOS:A1996VU22400018	8931557

Oxidation kinetics and microstructural evolution of the oxide and nitride layers								OXIDATION OF METALS				48	1-2			87	109		10.1007/BF01675263				AUG 1997	1997	The oxidation of alpha-Fe and epsilon-Fe2N1-z at 573 K and 673 K in O-2 at 1 atm was investigated by thermogravimetrical analysis, X-ray diffraction, light-optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and electron probe X-ray microanalysis. Upon oxidation at 573 K and 673 K, on alpha-Fe initially alpha-Fe2O3 develops, whereas on epsilon-Fe2N1-z initially Fe3O4 develops. In an early stage of oxidation the oxidation rate of epsilon-Fe2N1-z appears to be much larger than of alpha-Fe. This can be attributed largely to an effective surface area available for oxygen uptake, which is much larger for epsilon-Fe2N1-z than for alpha-Fe due to the porous structure of epsilon-Fe2N1-z as prepared by gaseous nitriding of iran. The development of a magnetite layer in-between the hematite layer and the alpha-Fe substrate, at a later stage of oxidation, enhances layer-growth kinetics. After 100 min oxidation at 673 K the (parabolic) oxidation rates for alpha-Fe and epsilon-Fe2N1-z become about equal, indicating that on both substrates the oxide growth is controlled by the same rate limiting step which is attributed to short-circuit diffusion of iron cations. Oxidizing epsilon-Fe2N1-z increases the nitrogen concentration in the remaining epsilon-iron nitride, because the outward flux of iron cations, necessary for oxide growth, leads to an accumulation of nitrogen atoms left behind.									74	2	0	0	0	0	76			0030-770X			WOS:A1997XR76800004		
J	Qin, Yonghua; Shen, Xin; Wang, Nili; Ding, Xipeng								Characterization of a novel cyclase-like gene family involved in controlling stress tolerance in rice								JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				181				30	41		10.1016/j.jplph.2015.03.018				JUN 1 2015	2015	A novel cyclase-like gene family (CYL) encodes proteins containing cyclase domain, but their functions are largely unknown. We report the systematic identification and characterization of CYL genes in the rice genome. Five putative CYL protein sequences (OsCYL1 to 4b) were identified. These sequences and other CYL homologs were classified into four subgroups based on phylogenetic analysis. Distinct diversification of these CYL proteins exists between plants and non-plants. The CYL family has conserved exon-intron structures, and the organizations of putative motifs in plants are specifically diverse. All OsCYL genes were expressed in a wide range of tissues or organs and were responsive to at least one of the abiotic stresses and hormone treatments applied. Protein OsCYL4a is targeted to the cell membrane. The overexpression of one stress-responsive gene OsCYL4a in rice resulted in decreased tolerance to salt, drought, cold, and oxidative stress. The expression levels of some abiotic stress-responsive factors, including H2O2-accumulating negative factors DST and OsSKIPa in OsCYL4a-overexpressing plants, were reduced compared with the wild type under normal condition and drought stress. These results suggest that rice CYL family may be functionally conserved polyketide cyclase, resulting in the rapid accumulation of reactive oxygen species to decrease tolerance to abiotic stresses.

The predicted topology of CP47 exhibits six membrane-spanning regions and a large hydrophilic loop (loop E) which rougly includes 200 residues (255-455) and is presumably exposed to the lumenal side of the thylakoid membrane. Several lines of experimental evidence suggest that loop E might be involved in binding or stabilizing functional manganese in the catalytic site of water oxidation or in interacting with the extrinsic PS II-O protein (the 33-kDa manganese-stabilizing protein). To scan loop E for functionally important domains, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis has been used to introduce deletions of 3-8 residues in conserved and charged regions of loop E. In addition, one single-site mutation of the only histidine present in loop E was created (H343L). Domains deleted in DELTA1 (1265-F268), DELTA2 (T271-K277), DELTA4 (T304-L309), DELTA5 (F311-N317), and DELTA12 (D440-P447) are required for stable assembly of functional PS II complexes. Deletion of domains DELTA3 (K277-E283) and DELTA11 (R422-E428) significantly reduces the level of assembled PS II and impairs photoautotrophic growth and oxygen evolution. Deletion of domain DELTA8 (A373-D380) enhances the susceptibility to photoinhibition. In contrast, deletion of domains DELTA6 (G333-1336), DELTA7 (K347-R352), DELTA9 (V392-Q394), and DELTA10 (D416-F420) and mutation of H343 to leucine do not seem to severly interrupt PS II structure and function, although all mutants exhibit a slightly decreased stability of PS II as compared to the wild type. Thus, selected domains of the large hydrophilic loop of CP47 are important for PS II structure and function. With respect to possible sites of interaction between loop E of CP47 and the extrinsic PS II-O protein, our results indicate that none of the deletions in the region from residue 330 to 420 (DELTA6, DELTA7, DELTA8, DELTA9, DELTA10) completely interrupts a functional association of the manganese-stabilizing protein to PS II, although the binding characteristics might be changed in some cases.									74	0	0	0	66	0	74			0006-2960			WOS:A1993KZ24600037	8476869	
J	Vershinin, A								Biological functions of carotenoids - diversity and evolution								BIOFACTORS				10	2-3			99	104		10.1002/biof.5520100203				1999	1999	Carotenoids first emerged in archaebacteria as lipids reinforcing cell membranes. To serve this function their long molecules have extremely rigid backbone due to the linear chain of usually 10 to 11 conjugated C=C bonds in trans-configuration - the length corresponding the thickness of hydrophobic zone of membrane which they penetrate as "molecular rivets". Carotenoids retain their membrane-reinforcing function in some fungi and animals.The general structure of carotenoid molecule, originally having evolved for mechanical functions in membranes, possess a number of other properties that were later used for independent functions. The most striking fact is that these properties proved to fit some new functions to perfection.The polyene chain of 9-11 double bonds absorbs light precisely in the gap of chlorophyll absorption function as accessory light-harvesting pigments in all plants;Unique arrangement of electronic levels owing to the by polyene chain structure makes carotenoids the only natural compounds capable of excitation energy transfer both (i) from carotenoid excited state to chlorophyll in the light-harvesting complex and (ii) from triplet chlorophyll or singlet oxygen to carotenoid in photosynthetic reaction centers - protection of RC from photodamage.The linear system of conjugated C=C bonds provides high reducing potential of carotenoid molecules making them potent antioxidants in lipid formations. Still, there is a lack of evidence of the chemical antioxidant function of carotenoids, especially in higher organisms; most data demonstrate an antioxidant ability rather than a function.Carotenoids have many other independent biological functions, including: specific coloration patterns in plants and animals, screening from excessive light and spectral filtering, defense of egg proteins from proteases in some invertebrates; the direct carotenoid derivative - retinal - acts as visual pigment in all animals and as chromophore in bacteriorhodopsin photosynthesis, retinoic acid in animals and abscisic acid in plants serve as hormones. All these functions utilize various properties (mechanical, electronic, stereospecific) of a single structure evolved in bacteria for a single membrane-reinforcing function, thus demonstrating an example of pure evolutionary preadaptation.One of the practical conclusions that can be reached by reviewing uniquely diverse properties and functions of carotenoids is that, when considering possible mechanisms of their effects in organisms (e.g., anticarcinogenic action), all their functional traits should be taken into account.									155	4	0	0	130	0	161			0951-6433			WOS:000085333900004	10609869

HIFs participate in infectious diseases and inflammatory responses, providing us a new therapeutic target for the treatment of diseases. In this study, 16 HIFs were identified in common carp genome database. Comparative genomics analysis showed large expansion of HIF gene family and approved the four round whole genome duplication (WGD) event in common carp. To further understand the function of HIFs, the domain architectures were predicted. All HIF proteins had the conserved HLH-PAS domain, which were essential for them to form dimer and bind to the downstream targets. The differences in domain of HIF alpha and HIF beta might result in their different functions. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all HIFs were divided into two subfamilies and the HIFs in common carp were clustered with their teleost counterparts indicating they are highly conservative during evolution. In addition, the tissue distribution was examined by RT-PCR showed that most of HIF genes had a wide range of tissue distribution but exhibited tissue-specific expression patterns. The expression divergences were observed between the copy genes, for example, HIF1A-1, HIF2A-1, ARNT-2 had wide tissue distribution while their copies had limited tissue distribution, proving the function divergence of copies post the WGD event. In order to find an effective activation of HIFs and apply to treatment of aquatic diseases, we investigate the dietary supplementation effects of different strains of Lactococcus laths on the expression of HIFa subfamily members in kidney of common carp infected with A. hydrophila. In addition, all of the HIF genes have a high expression in the early stages of infection, and decreased in the treatment time point of 48 h in common carp. This phenomenon confirms that as a switch, the main function of HIFs is to regulate the production of immune response factors in early infection. So activation of the switch may be an effective method for infectious disease treatment. As expected, the treatment groups improved the expression of HIFs compared with the control group, and the effects of the three strains are different. The strain1 of L. lactis had a stronger induction on HIF genes than strain2 and strain3, and it might be applied as a potential activation of HIF genes for disease treatment. So, adding befitting L. lactic maybe a well method to activate the HIF genes to protect them from mycobacterial infection.									7	2	0	0	5	0	9			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000483634300064	31252044

Characterizing surface reaction sites is needed for further development. In this study, (001)-oriented KTaO3 wafers were doped with Ca cations thorough a solid-state reaction to provide platforms for surface science studies. X-ray diffraction showed a Ca-rich perovskite-structured surface layer that covers the Ca-poor or pristine KTaO3 substrate. The lattice of the surface layer was contracted and rotated relative to the substrate lattice. The heteroepitaxial junction of the surface layer on the substrate mimicked the core-shell structure that is found in real photocatalyst particles. Nanometer-scale islands spontaneously appeared on the surface to correct the lattice mismatch across the surface-substrate junction. X-ray fluorescence holography was applied to determine the local, atom-scale structure around Ca cations in the host lattice. Atom distributions reconstructed from Ca K beta fluorescence holograms suggested that K and Ta cations were simultaneously exchanged with Ca cations. Local lattice deformation was quantitatively deduced around the Ca cations occupying the two different sites. The major features of real photocatalysts-heteroepitaxial surface-bulk junctions, surface restructuring to correct lattice mismatches, and simultaneous cation exchange-were reproduced in the doped wafers. The ability of X-ray fluorescence holography to determine a local structure around doping cations was also demonstrated.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000517351300009

Black phosphorus (BP) shows a great potential in photoelectric conversion and photocatalysis due to its tunable band gap and two-dimensional structure. In this work, a stabilized metal-free photocatalyst, reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-wrapped BP heterostructure, was prepared by assembling BP and GO nanosheets in aqueous solution followed by partial reduction and lyophilization. The surface tension of the partially reduced GO during lyophilization could make rGO nanosheets tightly wrap on both surfaces of exfoliated BP nanosheets. This wrapped heterostructure with tight bonding between rGO and BP nanosheets led to a high photocatalytic activity, owing to the rapid transfer of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs at the rGO/BP heterojunction and the high stability of rGO protecting BP from oxygen attack. This work not only provided a general method to prepare the sandwiched heterojunction based on GO with good interface binding capability but also constructed a highly active, stable, metal-free photocatalyst based on BP.									24	2	0	0	4	0	24			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000529924800082	32243136

It was found that the formation of BaTiO3 takes place above 600 degrees C. BaTiO3 powder was prepared by calcination of Ba(NO3)(2) and TiO2 precursor mixture at 800 degrees C for 8h. X-ray diffraction analysis of the synthesized BaTiO3 confirmed the formation of tetragonal phase. Average crystallite size was found to be 44nm, For the electrical and morphological characterization pellets of the obtained powder were sintered at 1000 degrees C for 12 h. Scanning electron micrograph (SEM) exhibits spherical and rod shaped grains. The dielectric constant, dissipation factor, complex plane impedance and ac conductivity of the sintered pellet has been measured in the temperature range of 40-600 degrees C and frequency range of 100 Hz-2 MHz. DC conductivity of the sample was obtained from the impedance data. The conductivities (both ac and dc) and relaxation time () exhibit two regions of temperature dependence, namely region I, which represents (280-450 degrees C) and region II, which governs (450-600 degrees C). Conduction and relaxation in both the temperature regions are explained in terms of hopping of electrons and doubly ionized oxygen vacancies (V-O(center dot center dot)).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1058-4587	1607-8489		WOS:000390891400020

GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				132				101	119		10.1016/j.gca.2014.01.040				MAY 1 2014	2014	The oxidation states of magmas provide valuable information about the release and speciation of volatile elements during volcanic eruptions, metallogenesis, source rock compositions, open system magmatic processes, tectonic settings and potentially titanium (Ti) activity in chemical systems used for Ti-dependent geothermometers and geobarometers. In this paper we explore the use of Mn in apatite as an oxybarometer in intermediate and silicic igneous rocks. Increased Mn concentrations in apatite in granitic rocks from the zoned Criffell granitic pluton (southern Scotland) correlate with decreasing Fe2O3 (Fe3+) and Mn in the whole-rock and likely reflect increased Mn2+/Mn3+ and greater compatibility of Mn2+ relative to Mn3+ in apatite under reduced conditions. Fe3+/Fe2+ ratios in biotites have previously been used to calculate oxygen fugacities (fO(2)) in the outer zone granodiorites and inner zone granites where redox conditions have been shown to change from close to the magnetite-hematite buffer to close to the nickel-nickel oxide buffer respectively (Stephens et al., 1985). This trend is apparent in apatite Mn concentrations from a range of intermediate to silicic volcanic rocks that exhibit varying redox states and are shown to vary linearly and negatively with log fO(2), such thatlogfO(2) = -0.0022(perpendicular to 0.0003)Mn(ppm) -9.75(perpendicular to 0.46)Variations in the Mn concentration of apatites appear to be largely independent of differences in the Mn concentration of the melt. Apatite Mn concentrations may therefore provide an independent oxybarometer that is amenable to experimental calibration, with major relevance to studies on detrital mineral suites, particularly those containing a record of early Earth redox conditions, and on the climatic impact of historic volcanic eruptions.

The surface morphology and structure of the M@N-C catalysts were characterized and an efficient catalytic degradation performance, high stability, and excellent reusability were observed. In addition, several operational factors, such as initial dye concentration, oxidant type (peroxymonosulfate, peroxydisulfate and H2O2) and dosage, reaction temperature, and dye type as well as stability of the composite were extensively evaluated in view of the practical applications. The results showed that various transition metals M significantly affected the structures and performances of the catalysts, and specially, their activity followed the order of Co > Fe > Ni in the presence of peroxymonosulfate. Moreover, HO center dot and SO4 center dot- radicals participating in the process were evidenced using quenching experiments, and a rational mechanism was proposed based on a non-radical process and the free radical process. Control experiments revealed that the enhanced active sites were mainly ascribed to the synergistic effects between the metal nanocrystals and nitrogen-doped carbon. The findings of this study elucidated that encapsulation of nanocrystals in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes was an effective strategy to enhance the overall catalytic activity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

II. The J-type stars								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				536	1			438	449		10.1086/308932				JUN 10 2000	2000	Abundances of lithium, heavy elements, and carbon isotope ratios have been measured in 12 J-type Galactic carbon stars. The abundance analysis shows that in these stars the abundances of s-process elements with respect to the metallicity are nearly normal. Te is not present in most of them, although upper limits have been derived for WZ Cas and WX Cyg, perhaps two SC-type rather than J-type carbon stars. The Rb abundances, obtained from the resonance lambda 7800 Rb I line, are surprisingly low, probably owing to strong non-LTE effects in the formation of this line in cool carbon-rich stars. Lithium and C-13 are found to be enhanced in all the stars. These results together with the nitrogen abundances and oxygen isotope ratios measured by Lambert et al. and Harris et al. are used to discuss the origin of J stars. The luminosity and variability class of the stars studied would indicate that they are low-mass (M less than or similar to 2-3 M.), less evolved objects than the normal carbon stars, although the presence of some luminous (M-bol < - 5.5) J stars in our Galaxy (WZ Cas may be an example) and in other galaxies, suggests the existence of at least two types of J stars, with different formation scenarios depending upon the initial mass of the parent star. Standard evolutionary AGE models an difficult to reconcile with all the observed chemical characteristics. In fact, they suggest the existence of an extra mixing mechanism that transports material from the convective envelope down to hotter regions where some nuclear burning occurs. This mechanism would act preferably on the early-AGE phase in low-mass stars. Mixing at the He-core flash and the binary system hypothesis are also discussed as alternatives to the above scenario.									79	2	0	0	1	0	79			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000087963300039

The SSP has been obtained in the form of monomer in which the metallic centers are bridged through the oxygen atom of the tert-butoxy group. The bipyridyl (bpy) and tetrahydroduran (THF), respectively, coordinated to the lead (Pb) and zirconium (Zr) centers contain the degree of polymerization of the bimetallic molecule.

One of the important questions of astrochemistry is how complex organic molecules, including potential prebiotic species, are formed in the envelopes around embedded protostars. The abundances of minor isotopologues of a molecule, in particular the D- and C-13-bearing variants, are sensitive to the densities, temperatures and timescales characteristic of the environment in which they form, and can therefore provide important constraints on the formation routes and conditions of individual species.Aims. The aim of this paper is to systematically survey the deuteration and the C-13 content of a variety of oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules on solar system scales toward the "B component" of the protostellar binary IRAS16293-2422.Methods. We have used the data from an unbiased molecular line survey of the protostellar binary IRAS16293-2422 between 329 and 363 GHz from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The data probe scales of 60 AU (diameter) where most of the organic molecules are expected to have sublimated off dust grains and be present in the gas phase. The deuterated and C-13 isotopic species of ketene, acetaldehyde and formic acid, as well as deuterated ethanol, are detected unambiguously for the first time in the interstellar medium. These species are analysed together with the C-13 isotopic species of ethanol, dimethyl ether and methyl formate along with mono-deuterated methanol, dimethyl ether and methyl formate.Results. The complex organic molecules can be divided into two groups with one group, the simpler species, showing a D/H ratio of approximate to 2% and the other, the more complex species, D/H ratios of 4-8%. This division may reflect the formation time of each species in the ices before or during warm-up/infall of material through the protostellar envelope. No significant differences are seen in the deuteration of different functional groups for individual species, possibly a result of the short timescale for infall through the innermost warm regions where exchange reactions between different species may be taking place. The species show differences in excitation temperatures between 125 and 300 K. This likely reflects the binding energies of the individual species, in good agreement with what has previously been found for high-mass sources. For dimethyl ether, the C-12/C-13 ratio is found to be lower by up to a factor of 2 compared to typical ISM values similar to what has previously been inferred for glycolaldehyde. Tentative identifications suggest that the same may apply for C-13 isotopologues of methyl formate and ethanol. If confirmed, this may be a clue to their formation at the late prestellar or early protostellar phases with an enhancement of the available C-13 relative to C-12 related to small differences in binding energies for CO isotopologues or the impact of FUV irradiation by the central protostar.Conclusions. The results point to the importance of ice surface chemistry for the formation of these complex organic molecules at different stages in the evolution of embedded protostars and demonstrate the use of accurate isotope measurements for understanding the history of individual species.									88	1	0	0	1	0	88			1432-0746			WOS:000453301200002

Theoretical modeling and experimental data								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				183				124	134		10.1016/j.cej.2011.12.042				FEB 15 2012	2012	The electrochemical oxidation of organics in water at boron doped diamonds (BDD) was experimentally investigated with the aim to discuss the correlations among the conversion of the pollutants and the instantaneous current efficiency ICE with the operative conditions. A simple theoretical model previously developed for the oxidation of oxalic acid accounting for the cases of mass transfer control, oxidation reaction control and mixed kinetic regimes was adopted and extended to challenge its predictive capability in the case of organics of different nature and in systems with more pollutants. A quite good agreement, between theoretical predictions and experimental data pertaining to the electrochemical oxidation of numerous organics, including some carboxylic acids and aliphatic chlorides, was observed, both for experiments performed in the presence of one or more organics. Results clearly indicate that such a simple model can be used to describe properly the "direct oxidation" (including oxidation by anodic electron transfer or by means of hydroxyl radicals) of organics at BDD. The comparison between the theoretical model and the experimental data strongly sustained the hypothesis that oxalic acid is oxidized by anodic electron transfer exchange while formic and maleic acids by reaction with hydroxyl radicals.

In this study, a pi-class GST cDNA sequence was first cloned from noble scallop Chlamys nobilis (named CnGSTp). The full length cDNA of CnGSTp was 922 bp, encoding a cytosolic protein of 202 amino acids residues, with predicted molecular masses of 23.1 kDa. Then an acute Vibrio Parahaemolyticus challenge experiment was conducted by using the Golden and Brown noble scallops with different total carotenoids content (TCC), and CnGSTp expression level, TCC and ROS level was separately determined. The results showed that ROS and CnGSTp expression levels were significantly up-regulate under Vibrio Parahaemolyticus challenge than the control group (P < 0.05). The Golden scallops showed significantly higher CnGSTp expression level and lower ROS level in hemocytes than the Brown ones (P < 0.05). Moreover, there is a significantly positive correlation between TCC and ROS in the Golden scallops. The present results revealed that CnGSTp plays important roles in immune response and carotenoids play assistant roles in antioxidant defense system under pathogenic stress in the noble scallop.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000571747700001	32652299	
J	Meng, Zhaocang; Wang, Canglong; Liu, Jitao; Wang, Yinlong; Zhu, Xiaolu; Yang, Lei; Huang, Liang				YANG, LEI/GQH-4271-2022				First-principles investigation of oxygen interaction with hydrogen/helium/vacancy irradiation defects in Ti3AlC2								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				23	9			5340	5351		10.1039/d0cp06462a				MAR 7 2021	2021	First-principles calculations have been performed to investigate the interaction between solute impurity O and H/He/vacancy irradiation defects in Ti3AlC2. The formation energy and occupation of O atoms within different defects as well as the trapping progress of O/H clusters are discussed. It is found that the O atom preferentially occupies the hexahedral interstitial site (I-hex-1) in bulk Ti3AlC2, whereas it prefers to occupy the neighbouring tetrahedral interstitial site (I-tetr-2) within pre-exisiting Al monovacancy (V-Al), Al divacancy (2V(Al-Al)) and the 2V(Al-C) divacancy composed of Al and C vacancies. The appearance of C vacancy could greatly reduce the oxygen formation energy and make an O atom more inclined to occupy the center of C vacancy. Vacancy could capture more O atoms than H/He atoms, where V-Al and 2V(Al-Al) could hold up to fifteen and eighteen O atoms, respectively. Meanwhile, the O could also promote the formation of Al vacancy. On the other hand, O atoms tend to occupy the interstitial sites near the Al atomic layer and have attraction to Al atoms, which is likely to enable the O atoms to combine with the Al atoms to form a Al2O3 protective layer, thus effectively inhibiting further oxidation inside the Ti3AlC2. In addition, the H-O exhibits repulsion interaction, but strong attraction occurs in the He-O interaction. Therefore, the O atom has an inhibitory effect on the formation of the H cluster, while it could bind more He atoms to form a large number of He bubbles. Besides, the O impurity greatly reduces the trapping ability of vacancy to H atoms, and O and He have a synergistic interaction for inhibiting the aggregation of H clusters. The present results are expected to provide a new insight into the behaviour of Ti3AlC2 under irradiation and oxidation conditions so that structural materials could be better designed.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000627550700021	33634300

Under AM1.5 simulated sunlight, CN-BA photocatalysts exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity compared to pure carbon nitride for the degradation of aniline. The highest activity is obtained with 2% doped CN-BA photocatalyst.Results: on the photodegradation of aniline indicate that for the optimized CN-BA photocatalyst, the concentration of aniline solution was reduced gradually from 16 mg/L to 1.354 mg/L in 2 h. This corresponds to a 6 times higher photodegradation efficiency than pure carbon nitride samples. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of CN-BA relies on the enhanced surface area, the higher light absorption and the reduced recombination of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs. This interpretation results from multiple characterizations with EPR, BET, N-2 adsorption, Solid-state C-13 NMR, UV-vis DRS, FESEM, and TEM. Under simulated sunlight irradiation, CN-BA is excited and generates electron-hole pairs. The photo generated electrons in the CN-BA conduction band react with the molecular oxygen to form O-center dot(2)-. Part of the O-center dot(2)- transforms into (OH)-O-center dot, which further oxides aniline. Meanwhile, photo-generated holes in the valence band of CN-BA can benefit to the formation of (OH)-O-center dot or directly oxide aniline.

To solve these drawbacks, a photoanode consisting of NiO nanoparticles anchored on a gradient phosphorus-doped -Fe2O3 nanorod (NR) array (NiO/P--Fe2O3) was fabricated to achieve optimal light absorption and charge separation, as well as rapid surface reaction kinetics. Specifically, a photoanode with the NR array structure allowed a high mass-transport rate to be achieved, while phosphorus doping effectively decreased the number of surface trapping sites and improved the electrical conductivity of -Fe2O3. Furthermore, the p-n junction that forms between NiO and P--Fe2O3 can further improve the PEC performance due to efficient hole extraction and the water oxidization catalytic activity of NiO. Consequently, the NiO/P--Fe2O3 NR photoanode produced a high photocurrent density of 2.08mAcm(-2) at 1.23V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode and a 110mV cathodic shift of the onset potential. This rational design of structure offers a new perspective in exploring high-performance PEC photoanodes.									50	0	0	0	3	0	50			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000438198400019	29768719

Oxidation was performed at temperatures ranging from 300 to 600 K. The oxidation kinetics were described quantitatively with the coupled currents model according to Fromhold and Cook, adopting time-dependent work functions at the metal/oxide and oxide/oxygen interfaces. The evolution of the work functions of a-Fe could be related to the change of the oxide film composition, which evolved with increasing film thickness from approximately FeO to a composition close to Fe3O4. Upon oxidation of epsilon-Fe2N1-x, the N atoms accumulated underneath the oxide film, which could lead to an N concentration larger than the maximum equilibrium solubility of nitrogen in epsilon-Fe2N1-x. This excess nitrogen hinders the oxidation and transport of Fe atoms and is associated with a negative charge, which led to a slower initial oxidation. Upon prolonged oxidation, the oxidation rate of epsilon-Fe2N1-x could be related to the presence of an Fe1-deltaO-like oxide or oxynitride in the oxide film.									28	0	0	0	0	0	28			0044-3093			WOS:000177002000007

The recent description of a few examples of bacterial forms of the enzyme, located in the periplasm of different Gram-negative micro-organisms, prompted a re-evaluation of this general perception. A PCR-based approach has been developed and used successfully to identify bacterial genes encoding [Cu,Zn]-SOD in a wide range of important human and animal pathogens - members of the Haemophilus, Actinobacillus and Pasteurella (HAP) group, and Neisseria meningitidis. Comparison of [Cu,Zn]-SOD peptide sequences found in Haemophilus ducreyi, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Pasteurella multocida, and N, meningitidis with previously described bacterial proteins and examples of eukaryotic [Cu,Zn]-SOD has shown that the bacterial proteins constitute a distinct family apparently widely separated in evolutionary terms from the eukaryotic examples. The widespread occurrence of [Cu,Zn]-SOD in the periplasm of bacterial pathogens, appropriately located to dismute exogenously derived superoxide radical anions, suggests that this enzyme may play a role in the interactive biology of organisms with their hosts and so contribute to their capacity to cause disease.									111	0	0	0	93	1	117			1350-0872			WOS:A1995RW65200031	7496539

SnO2-Sb-CNT composite composed of 4-5 nm SnO2-Sb particles was synthesized via co-precipitation prior to the electrode preparation and characterized with BET and TEM. Characterization of Ti/SnO2-Sb/SnO2-Sb-CNT by FESEM, EDS, XRD, XPS, LSV, CV and EIS revealed that the novel duplex structured electrode had larger electroactive surface area and lower charge transfer resistance than conventional Ti/SnO2-Sb prepared by thermochemical decomposition, due to its more compact and rough surface. It also improved the electrochemical stability of Ti/SnO2-Sb/SnO2-Sb-CNT with a service lifetime up to 86 h. The oxygen evolution potential (OEP) of Ti/SnO2-Sb/SnO2-Sb-CNT was determined to be 2.2 V (vs Ag/AgCI). Bulk electrolysis of bisphenol A (BPA) was conducted to evaluate the electrocatalytic performance of the electrodes at various current densities (10-40 mA cm(-2)) and initial pH (3-11) of solution by determination of BPA degradation, total organic carbon (TOC) removal and mineralization current efficiency (MCE). Ti/SnO2-Sb/SnO2-Sb-CNT intended to adsorb more BPA molecules, which may contribute to its high current efficiency for electrochemical oxidation of BPA. The presence of humic acid (HA) could decrease the performance efficiency by inhibiting the adsorption of BPA by Ti/SnO2-Sb/SnO2-Sb-CNT. A mechanism is proposed to illustrate the enhanced degradation of BPA by Ti/SnO2-Sb/SnO2-Sb-CNT by synergistic adsorption and electrochemical oxidation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Initially, the hydrolysis reaction of the ceramic particles in the electroless solution was studied as a reference element for the design of a protective surface barrier that enabled the coating process, with no ceramic phase degradation. The metal source of the electrolytic bath was copper sulfate, with formaldehyde as the reducing agent, under alkaline conditions of pH 12. The microstructural characterization indicated the formation and growth of aluminum hydroxides from AlN particles, inhibiting the coating of Cu by increasing the OH ions in the solution. As the exposure time increased, the ellipsoidal bayerite grew from AlN and transformed into prismatic particles of the thermodynamically more stable gibbsite phase. To prevent the degradation of AlN, a controlled oxidation stage was implemented to form a protective barrier of non-reactive alumina on the surface through thermal treatment in oxidizing atmospheres. An atmosphere of dry air was found to be more appropriate than pure oxygen for the formation of a continuous and dense layer of crack-free alumina on nitride surfaces, and a temperature of 1000 degrees C for 1 h enabled the formation of 3.9 by weight of alpha-Al2O3, capable of reducing the hydrolysis reaction of AlN. The process of autocatalytic deposition on the passivated particles, applied in three consecutive steps of metallization, led to AlN-Cu composite powders with 29 wt% Cu. Finally, the coated powders were treated in a hydrogen-reducing atmosphere at 400 degrees C to remove traces of the Al(OH)(3) phase encountered, as well as to improve the adhesion of the nanostructured deposit of the cauliflower-like structure to the AlN surfaces, obtaining AlN-Cu composite powders suitable for the preparation of metal/ceramic composites.

RITCHIE, Raymond/AAK-7212-2020				Photosynthesis of Oil Palm (Elaeis guineensis)								SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE				214				34	40		10.1016/j.scienta.2016.11.013				JAN 5 2017	2017	Oil Palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantations cover more than 107,000 km(2) in SE-Asia but there is little information on its photosynthetic characteristics. Photosynthesis in seedling, juvenile and adult Oil Palm (6 months, 12 y and >5 y old, respectively) were measured using blue-diode Pulse Amplitude Modulation Fluorometry (PAM). The Absorptance Factor of the leaves (Abt(465nm)) was measured using a Reflectance Absorptance Transmission (RAT) meter to calculate actual, rather than relative Electron Transport Rates (ETR). Midday measurements in juvenile and adult Oil Palm tree were: maximum quantum yield of Photosystem II (Y-max) in juveniles was about 0.63, Optimum irradiance (E-opt) was approximate to 300 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1). The maximum ETR (ETRmax) of juvenile plants was 24.06 +/- 1.69 mu mol e(-) m(-2) s(-1): based on 4e-/O-2 this is equivalent to a maximum Photosynthetic Oxygen Evolution Rate (POERmax) of 89.21 +/- 6.25 mu mol O-2 mg Chl a(-1) h(-1). Adult Oil Palm plants have a Y-max similar to juveniles but E-opt was approximate to 600 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1). The ETRmax of adult plants was 58.97 +/- 2.07 mu mol e(-) m(-2) s(-1): or POERmax = 305.3 +/- 10.7 mu mol O-2 mg Chl a(-1) h(-1). Oil Palm is a classic sun plant with high photosynthetic rates at high irradiances. Photosynthetic efficiencies (alpha(0)) were high for C3 sun plants: alpha(0) in adult plants (0.272 +/- 0.018 e(-) photon(-1)) was higher than juvenile plants (0.204 +/- 0.034 e(-) photon(-1)) expressed on a leaf surface area basis and on a Chl a basis (1.406 +/- 0.093 vs. 0.757 +/- 0.124 O-2 photon(-1) m(2) g Chl a(-1)). In juvenile and adult plants E-opt, POERmax and alpha(0) tend to maximize about midday. In seedlings, E-opt and POERmax are highest in the early morning but maximum alpha(0) is at about midday. Oil Palms strategically optimize photosynthesis for high irradiances and manipulate their photosynthesis vs. irradiance characteristics during the course of daylight. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The densities of N2(A) are inferred from the absorbance of the Q(1)(22) and Q(3)(16) lines of the (2 <- 0) vibrational band of the first positive system (B-3 Pi g - A(3)Sigma(+)(u)) of N-2 at 769.945 nm. The procedure for determining the temporal evolution of the density of metastable from the measured ring down signals is presented. The maximum number densities are in the range of 10(14)-10(15) molecules cm(-3) for air and nitrogen discharges, respectively. In nitrogen, the decay of the N2(A) density is shown to be a second-order process with a rate coefficient of 1.1 x 10(-9) cm(3) s(-1) at 1600 K with a factor of 2 uncertainty. In air, the decay is estimated to be I order of magnitude faster than that in nitrogen owing to quenching by atomic and molecular oxygen. Furthermore, the rotational temperature is determined by comparison of CRDS measurements and simulations of several rotational lines of the (2 <- 0) band of the first positive system of N-2 between 769.8 and 770.7 nm. The rotational and vibrational temperatures are also determined by comparison of optical emission measurements and simulations of the second positive system of N-2 between 365 and 385 nm. In these CRDS measurements, we achieved a temporal resolution down to 50 ns.									43	1	0	0	1	0	43			1089-5639			WOS:000273268900025	19957990

To elucidate the role of the ORF62 protein, the coding region of the gene was disrupted with an aadA cassette. yielding mutant plants that were nearly (more than 95%) homoplasmic for ycf9 inactivation. The ycf9 mutant had no altered phenotype under standard growth conditions, but its growth rate was severely reduced under suboptimal irradiances. On the other hand, it was less susceptible to photodamage than the wild type. ycf9 inactivation resulted in a clear reduction in protein amounts of CP26, the NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complex, and the plastid terminal oxidase. Furthermore, depletion of ORF62 led to a faster flow of electrons to photosystem I without a change in the maximum electron transfer capacity of photosystem II. Despite the reduction of CP26 in the mutant thylakoids, no differences in PSII oxygen evolution rates were evident even at low light intensities. On the other hand, the ycf9 mutant presented deficiencies in the capacity for PSII-independent electron transport (ferredoxin-dependent cyclic electron transport and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase-mediated plastoquinone reduction). Altogether, it is shown that depletion of ORF62 leads to anomalies in the photosynthetic electron transfer chain and in the regulation of electron partitioning among the different routes of electron transport.									20	0	0	0	19	0	21			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000169135100149	11259438

Employing WS2 as cocatalyst and CuInS2 as p-type semiconductor and photosensitizer, a novel WS2/Mn0.5Cd0.5S/CuInS2 hierarchical tandem p-n heterostructure was constructed based on the energy band engineering theory. In this tandem p-n heterostructure, Mn0.5Cd0.5S nanoparticles adhere closely to CuInS2 nanosheets to form a p-n junction along with the strong and monodirectional inner-built electric field, which can regulate the directional transfer/migration of photoinduced electrons-hole pairs and significantly boost the charge separation. Furthermore, the WS2 cocatalyst employed in the ternary heterostructure further expedites the spatial charge separation and directional migration of photoexcited electrons, as well as simultaneously provides plentiful reaction active sites to decrease the activation barrier for hydrogen generation reaction. Benefiting from the synergetic cooperation of WS2 cocatalyst and the p-n junction charge transfer channels, the smartly designed ternary WS2/Mn0.5Cd0.5S/CuInS2 heterostructure displays the optimal photoactivity toward hydrogen production (681.7 mu mol h-1), more 3.98-fold enhancement than individual Mn0.5Cd0.5S under simulated sunlight irradiation. This research provides a new avenue for constructing multihierarchical systems with remarkably boosted charge separation and light-harvesting abilities for highefficiency solar energy conversion.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000797914700001

J	VandenBerg, DA; Swenson, FJ; Rogers, FJ; Iglesias, CA; Alexander, DR								Models for old, metal-poor stars with enhanced alpha-element abundances. I. Evolutionary tracks and ZAHB loci; Observational constraints								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				532	1			430	452		10.1086/308544				MAR 20 2000	2000	Stellar evolutionary tracks have been computed for 17 [Fe/H] values from -2.31 to -0.30 assuming, in each case, [alpha/Fe] = 0.0, 0.3, and 0.6. The helium abundance was assumed to vary from Y = 0.2352 at [Fe/H] = -2.31 to Y = 0.2550 at [Fe/H] = -0.30 and held constant for the different choices of [alpha/Fe] at a fixed iron content. Masses in the range 0.5 less than or equal to M. less than or equal to 1.0, in 0.1 M. steps, were generally considered, though sequences for higher mass values were computed, as necessary, to ensure that isochrones as "young" as 8 Gyr could be generated for each grid. All of the stellar models are based on an equation of state that treats nonideal effects, the latest nuclear reaction and neutrino cooling rates, and opacities that were computed specifically for the adopted chemical mixtures. The tracks were extended to the tip of the giant branch or to an age of 30 Gyr, whichever came first, and zero-age horizontal-branch (ZAHB) loci were constructed using the helium core masses and chemical profiles from appropriate red giant precursors. Selected models have been compared with those computed by A. V. Sweigart, for the same masses and chemical compositions, to demonstrate that the results obtained from two entirely independent stellar evolution codes agree well with one another when very similar input physics is assumed. In the case of extremely metal-deficient stars, an enhancement in the abundance of the alpha-elements causes a single, fairly significant bump in the opacity at a temperature just above 10(6) K, which is caused by absorption processes involving the K shell of oxygen. This peak becomes steadily more pronounced as the overall metallicity increases and a second bump, arising from the L edges of Ne, Mg, and Si, eventually appears near log T = 5.6. As far as the tracks and isochrones are concerned, we find that, as already reported by others, it is possible to mimic the computations for [alpha/Fe] > 0 remarkably well by those for scaled-solar mixes simply by requiring the total mass-fraction abundance of the heavy elements, Z, to be the same. However, this result holds only for metallicities significantly less than solar. Above [Fe/H] greater than or similar to -0.8, tracks and isochrones for enhanced alpha-element mixtures begin to have systematically hotter/bluer turnoffs and red giant branches than those for scaled-solar mixtures of the heavy elements. Also addressed is the extent to which our models satisfy the constraints posed by the local subdwarfs, the distances of which are based on Hipparcos parallax measurements. Our analysis suggests that the predicted metallicity dependence of the location of the lower main sequence on the C-M diagram is in good agreement with the observed dependence In fact, we do not find any compelling evidence from the local Population II calibrators that the colors of our models require significant adjustments. In further support of our calculations, we find that, both in zero point and slope, the computed giant branches on the (M-bol, log T-eff)-plane agree well with those inferred for globular clusters from observations in the infrared.Moreover, our ZAHB models have luminosities that are just outside the 1 sigma error bars of the mean M-V's inferred for RR Lyrae stars from Baade-Wesselink, statistical parallax, and trigonometric parallax studies. Lower helium contents or higher alpha-element abundances or an increase in the conductive opacities are among the possible ways of reducing the differences that remain. To facilitate comparisons with observations, the tracks/ZAHBs are provided with predicted BV(RI)(C) photometry.									282	8	0	0	0	2	285			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000086330400039		
J	THERSSEN, E; GOURICHON, L; DELFOSSE, L								DEVOLATILIZATION OF COAL PARTICLES IN A FLAT FLAME - EXPERIMENTAL AND MODELING STUDY								COMBUSTION AND FLAME				103	1-2			115	128		10.1016/0010-2180(95)00092-K				OCT 1995	1995	Pulverized coals have been tested under the conditions of industrial flames, with high heating rate and high temperatures. Coal particles were injected (5 g/h) into a flat, air-propane flame at 1400 degrees C. The chars were collected after different pyrolysis times. The thermal history of the particles, as monitored by two color pyrometry, shows that particles undergo very large heating rates (6 X 10(6) K/s) and reach a peak temperature of 1100 degrees C. For eight coals (volatile matter 1-57% d.a.f.), the devolatilized fraction of coal has been measured, as well as those of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen. In every case, the devolatilized fraction of coal was greater than the predicted A.S.T.M. value, but proportional to it. The devolatilized fraction of hydrogen seems to be a more sensitive parameter than the coal's weight loss. During pyrolysis, the evolution of the texture of the grains has been studied by measurement of their microporous surface area, which undergoes a large increase, depending on coal rank. The composition of the volatiles, as deduced from the ultimate and proximate analysis of chars, showed high volatile bituminous coals to essentially produce tars with an aromatic structure. In that case, the surface area passed through a maximum at the beginning of devolatilization, The subsequent decrease could be due to recondensation of heavy molecular weight volatile matter at the char's surface. Low and medium volatile bituminous coals produced light hydrocarbons on devolatilization and the char's surface area continued increasing slowly during the whole of devolatilization, according to the slow increase of the fraction of hydrogen devolatilized. The char's reactivity with oxygen was followed by measurements of Active Surface Area (A.S.A.). It was shown that the A.S.A. continuously decreases during devolatilization. This may be due to the departure of prompt volatiles made of aliphatic groups, which are potential active sites for oxygen. Five models of devolatilization in the literature were tested and compared to the experimental results, assuming first-order reactions with respect to the remaining volatile matter. Badzioch's model correctly fitted the experimental results and values of the rate constant obtained by computer trial and error adjustment were higher for lower ranks of the four bituminous coals. Anthony's model also fits the measurements, provided an adjustment of the preexponential factor and activation energy (k(0), E(0)), for which it is shown that an infinite number of such pairs is suitable. If the model is run isothermally at the flame's peak temperature, it also correctly fits the experimental results.									27	1	0	0	0	1	29			0010-2180			WOS:A1995RT84000009

Herein, we report a novel magnetically separable Au-loaded CaFe2O4/CoAl LDH heterostructure with strong coulombic interfacial interactions fabricated through a simple two-step process. XRD, XPS and TEM analysis of the synthesized samples were carried out for the structural and morphological characterization. The TEM study confirmed the existence of a firm attachment between the Au nanoparticles with the CaFe2O4/CoAl LDH heterostructures, which provides a unique support due to an exterior confinement effect. Formation of the heterojunction with a different electronic behaviour was also confirmed from an inverted V-shaped M-S plot, suggesting the presence of a large intimate contact interface between CoAl LDH and CaFe2O4 to favour the efficient separation and transfer of photoinduced charge pairs. The CoAl LDH-CaFe2O4@Au ternary heterostructure showed a high hydrogen generation rate of 379.1 mu mol h(-1), oxygen evolution rate of 205.5 mu mol h(-1) and Cr(VI) reduction rate of 99% under visible light irradiation. The CoAl LDH-CaFe2O4@Au heterostructure demonstrated its long-term stability and durability during photocatalytic investigations. The efficient photocatalytic activity of the catalysts was due to the synergistic effect of hot electron transfer by Au nanoparticles and easy mass transport through the interface owing to formation of a p-n junction by increasing the contact area. The mechanism of the photocatalytic activity was also supported by PL, EIS and photocurrent measurements. This work provides a novel strategy to design junction-based nanostructures as a promising photocatalyst for solar energy conversion.									53	3	0	0	2	0	53			2052-1553			WOS:000457275000007

Having earth-abundance, low biotoxicity, robustness, and an ideal n-type band position, hematite (-Fe2O3), the most common natural form of iron oxide, has occupied the research hotspot for decades. Here, a close look into recent progress of hematite photoanodes for PEC water splitting is provided. Effective approaches are introduced, such as cocatalysts loading and surface passivation layer deposition, to improve the hematite surface reaction in thermodynamics and kinetics. Second, typical methods for enhancing light absorption and accelerating charge transport in hematite bulk are reviewed, concentrating upon doping and nanostructuring. Third, the back contact between hematite and substrate, which affects interface states and electron transfer, is deliberated. In addition, perspectives on the key challenges and future prospects for the development of hematite photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting are given.									174	15	0	0	11	0	175			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000439737700004	29750372

Isua (Greenland) similar to 3700 Ma meta-serpentinite olivine Mg# and delta O-18 signatures show connection between the early mantle and hydrosphere: Geodynamic implications								PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH				361						106249	10.1016/j.precamres.2021.106249		MAY 2021		AUG 1 2021	2021	The similar to 3700 Ma Inner Arc Group of the Isua supracrustal belt (Greenland) contains a 10 km long strip of ultramafic schists with two <= 1 km long meta-dunite lenses, preserving relict olivine + antigorite + titano-clinohumite and titano-chondrodite similar to 2.6 GPa ultra-high-pressure (UHP) assemblages. There are two distinct relict meta-peridotite variants: The southern lens 'A' variant is dominated by an aggregate of Fo(91-92) olivine with delta O-18(VSMOW) of + 5.4 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand (95% confidence) in which are rare small clinopyroxene inclusions, plus rare interstitial accessory chrome spinel partly altered to magnetite. The olivine grains are bounded by serpentine domains, which are intergrown with the olivine margins with a marginally more iron-rich composition of Fo(90)(.5). The northern lens 'B' contains coarser-grained Fo(96-98) olivine which encloses magnetite as clusters and trails, some arranged with 60 degrees-120 degrees conjugate intersections. The Fo(96-98) olivine has delta O-18(VSMOW) of + 3.2 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand and is in equilibrium with high-Al antigorite and the accessory UHP Ti-rich minerals.We interpret that the Fo(90-92) versus the Fo(96-98) olivine assemblage variants are caused by a varying degree of fluid influx during ca. 3700 Ma serpentinisation, prior to peak UHP metamorphism. The Fo(90-92) variant was a rock-dominated system with a postulated early serpentine + ferroan brucite alteration assemblage, with abundant relict mantle-like delta O-18(VSMOW )+ 5.4 parts per thousand olivine. The Fo(96-98) variant was a fluid-dominated system, where obliteration of the protolith olivine formed serpentine + magnetite + brucite +/- magnesite. During prograde UHP metamorphism consumption of brucite by reaction with serpentine gave rise to a lower delta(18)O(VSMOW )Fo(96-98) olivine + serpentine assemblage. Both varieties have similar bulk chemistry, interpreted as depleted mantle that was enriched in LILE and LREE by a melt or fluid, prior to varying degrees of serpentinisation and superimposed UHP metamorphism.In Phanerozoic abyssal peridotites similar textural, chemical and isotopic variations are the result of rock versus fluid-dominated serpentinisation and variable alteration temperatures. Analogously, the Fo(96-98) Isua peridotites are interpreted as mantle peridotite entirely serpentinised by high temperature seawater in a fluid-dominated environment and then metamorphosed under UHP conditions at a convergent plate boundary. This indicates lateral lithosphere motions facilitating hydrosphere - mantle communication early in Earth's history.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0301-9268	1872-7433		WOS:000663340100011

The morphology was changed from nanorod to nanotube via a well-controlled chemical aqueous etching process with appropriate amount potassium chloride (KCl). SEM analyses show that the ZnO nanorods can be changed to nanotubes when the chemical etching process was adopted with appropriate KCl concentration and etching time. Uniform ZnO nanotube can be achieved formed when the ZnO nanorods were immersed in 4M KCl aqueous with 13 hrs. The luminescence character of nanorods and nanotubes were investigated by the temperature dependence photoluminescence spectra. Two peaks (excitonic peak and deep level emission) were observed in both morphologies. However, the excitonic peak intensity (EI) and defect related emission peak intensity (DI) ratio of ZnO nanotubes increase when the etching time increases.

The strong coupling effect of metal-support imparts a strong electronic interaction between the Fe2P and Pt interface that can weaken the adsorption of poisoning CO species according to the d-band theory. Defects and increased surface area of the petaloid Fe2P are beneficial to the Pt nanoparticle anchoring and dispersion as well as the charge transfer and reactant transportation during the electrochemical reaction. These features make the Pt-Fe2P catalyst system exhibit excellent catalytic activity, antipoisoning ability, and catalytic stability for alcohol fuel of methanol ethanol electro-oxidation compared with a controlled Pt/C catalyst. The high catalytic efficiency is proposed to come from the strong coupling effect of Pt and petaloid Fe2P interface that can maintain the mechanical and chemical stability of the catalyst system. This kind of phosphide-supported ultrafine Pt nanocrystals will be a promising catalyst in fuel cells.									73	6	0	0	5	0	76			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000460996900086	30758944	
J	Sun, Shichao; Wang, Zhihong; Meng, Suci; Yu, Rui; Jiang, Deli; Chen, Min								Iron and chromium co-doped cobalt phosphide porous nanosheets as robust bifunctional electrocatalyst for efficient water splitting								NANOTECHNOLOGY				33	7					075204	10.1088/1361-6528/ac297e				FEB 12 2022	2022	It is still a huge challenge to develop highly efficient and low-cost non-precious metal-based electrocatalysts for overall water splitting in alkaline electrolytes. Herein, Cr and Fe co-doped CoP porous mesh nanosheets (Mesh-CrFe-CoP NSs) were synthesized through hydrolysis reaction, ion exchange etching and subsequent low-temperature phosphating process. The Mesh-CrFe-CoP NSs provides overpotentials at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) under alkaline electrolyte of 103.7 mV and 256.4 mV for HER and OER, respectively. Furthermore, when using Mesh-CrFe-CoP NSs as anode and cathode, the water splitting system could afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.55 V, which is better than an electrolytic cell composed of 20% Pt/C and RuO2. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of Mesh-CrFe-CoP NSs is attributed to the co-doping and porous nanostructure. Specifically, the Cr and Fe co-doped porous CoP nanosheets electrocatalyst not only provided abundant exposure active sites, accelerated the entry of liquid and the diffusion of gas, but also regulated the electronic environment of active sites, and thus enhanced the electrochemical performance. This work proposes a strategy for the rational design of highly efficient and stable non-precious metal co-doped phosphide electrocatalysts in the of electrochemical water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000722020500001	34555817

Perchlorate ions could be rapidly adsorbed in the presence of benzalkonium chloride, facilitating its subsequent reduction on the Re-Pd/BC particle electrode. On the basis of the characterization results and kinetics analysis, a synergistic effect of Re and Pd was observed, perchlorate could be efficiently reduced and completely converted into chlorine in optimized conditions (pH 3.0, anaerobic and current density 20 mA/cm(2)) and the reduction rate constant of Re-Pd/BC was 0.9451 L-1 g(cat)(-1). The superfluous oxygen in solution could lead to Re-Pd/BC deactivation, and increased current density was beneficial of electro-reduction. The increased pH lead to decrease of reduction efficiency, and the coexisting anion of nitrate could be competed with perchlorate for reduction sites which lead to decrease of reduction rate. Based on the experimental results, it was found that the existing form of Re and Pd on the surface of Re-Pd/BC, the number of atomic H* and current density played an important role in perchlorate electro-reduction process.									11	0	0	0	6	0	10			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000434467000077

The dimensions of the nanosheets are 0.001 x 1.2 x 1.2 mu m(3) based on TEM measurements and crystallographic data, and their band gap is determined as 3.53 eV based on the absorption band edge at 350 rim. When an aqueous suspension of the nanosheets is irradiated with light from a Hg lamp, hydrogen is produced at rates of up to 2.28 mu mol/h with a quantum efficiency (QE) of 0.22%. No oxygen is evolved. Derivatization of the nanosheets with Pt nanoparticles increases the hydrogen production rate to 78.37 mu mol (QE = 7.5%). Restacking of the nanosheets at low pH does not significantly affect the catalytic activity. Transient absorption measurements of the nanosheets reveal charge separation on a nanosecond time scale.									126	0	0	0	6	0	127			1932-7447			WOS:000249986600001

It is prepared for the first time by atomic layer deposition. Using the resulting well-defined thin films as a model system, the performance of ZnFe2O4 in photoelectrochemical water oxidation is characterized. Compared to benchmark -Fe2O3 (hematite) films, ZnFe2O4 thin films achieve a lower photocurrent at the reversible potential. However, the oxidation onset potential of ZnFe2O4 is 200 mV more cathodic, allowing the water-splitting reaction to proceed at a lower external bias and resulting in a maximum applied-bias power efficiency (ABPE) similar to that of Fe2O3. The kinetics of the water oxidation reaction are examined by intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy. The data indicate a considerably higher charge transfer efficiency of ZnFe2O4 at potentials between 0.8 and 1.3 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, attributable to significantly slower surface charge recombination. Finally, nanostructured ZnFe2O4 photoanodes employing a macroporous antimony-doped tin oxide current collector reach a five times higher photocurrent than the flat films. The maximum ABPE of these host-guest photoanodes is similarly increased.									84	1	0	0	6	0	84			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000379905800001

It is largely utilized for recovering metals and oxidizing recalcitrant organic compounds. This paper aims to discuss the performance of the photo-oxidation and reduction by applying semiconductor photo-catalysis as the anode and graphite as the cathode for treating rainwater in Tehran, Iran. Organic pollutants and different metals were investigated to study the probable roles of the anodic potential, the gap between electrodes, and the concentration of electrolytes in the possible mechanisms. The laboratory experiments which lasted for 120 min exhibited that the best performance for organic, iron, manganese, and lead removal was at the anodic potential of 10 V and gap of 6 cm. But, for zinc and cadmium, the best performance occurred at the anodic potential of 5.5 V and sodium chloride of 0.65 g/L. The presented reactions and mechanisms demonstrated incidents using the treatment process. They were identical to the presented dendrogram and Pourbaix diagrams. The results of the diagrams showed iron, manganese, and lead were removed by oxidation at the photo-anode. Zinc and cadmium were mainly removed by precipitation. Chemical oxygen demand, iron, manganese, and lead were significantly related and behaved similarly in the treatment process. Their removal was controlled by all the analyzed parameters. This paper may present a cost-effective approach for removing organic and metallic pollutants by photo-assisted electrochemical process. It can be suggested for future evolution of photo-assisted electrochemical on the treatment applications of rainwater.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1735-1472	1735-2630		WOS:000610478900004

Boningari, Thirupathi/0000-0002-3364-4377			Low-temperature selective catalytic reduction of NO with NH3 over V/ZrO2 prepared by flame-assisted spray pyrolysis: Structural and catalytic properties								APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL				127				255	264		10.1016/j.apcatb.2012.08.012				OCT 30 2012	2012	A series of V/ZrO2 (V/Zr atomic ratio = 0.05, 0.11, 0.17, 0.25, 0.33, 0.42), V-WOx(0.66)/ZrO2, and V-MoOx(0.66)/ZrO2 were synthesized by adopting a one-step flame spray pyrolysis technique and investigated for the low-temperature selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO with ammonia in the presence of excess oxygen. Our XRD results suggest that the vanadia species are in amorphous state as dominant surface monomeric VOx species on zirconia support in V/ZrO2 samples with V/Zr <= 0.17. Further increase in vanadia content led to the formation of ZrV2O7 solid solution as a result of zirconia migration into the V2O5 crystallites. H-2-TPR data results are highly consistent with the XRD results that the low temperature shifts in the reduction peaks of 15% V/ZrO2 catalyst attributed to the presence of more easily reducible dominant surface monomeric VOx species. The evolution of a new reduction peak at high temperature indicates the formation of dominantly isolated polymeric V oxides species in V/ZrO2 samples with V/Zr >= 0.25. Our H-2-TPR profiles for tungsten-promoted V/ZrO2 catalyst revealed the shift of (T-1) peak position to lower temperatures, suggesting that the reduction potential of vanadium oxide species is increased compared to V/ZrO2 catalyst. This occurrence signifying that the addition of tungsten to V/ZrO2 promoted the catalyst for the formation of monomeric surface vanadia species, whereas the addition of Mo promoted the formation of polymeric VOx species and thus inhibit the SCR activity. An intense sharp band characteristic of coordinatively held NO2 species is evident at 1630 cm(-1), no gaseous N2O species were detected at 2224 cm(-1), 1286 cm(-1) in the in-situ FT-IR spectra of NO adsorbed over the V/ZrO2. Our in-situ FT-IR studies of NO+NH3 co-adsorption demonstrate that the strong signals at 1435 and 1714 cm(-1) (bending vibration of NH4+) have seen to decrease with respect to temperature. This observation reveals that the NH4+ species bound to Bronsted acid sites are responsible for the enhancement in the SCR reaction over the vanadia-zirconia surfaces. The low temperature NO catalytic reduction activity would indicate that an optimal dispersion of monomeric VOx species on zirconia is attained with the 15% of V in the V/ZrO2 catalyst. The introduction of Zr (seven fold coordination) into V2O5 may lead to the reduction of elemental number in crystal grain and deviation of adjacent oxygen atoms. The change in lattice parameter, crystal anisotropy and negative thermal expansion can block the release of labile oxygen, this seems to be the reason for the decrease in catalytic activity in V/ZrO2 catalysts with V/Zr >= 0.25. The addition of tungsten has a strong influence on the NO conversion, since tungsten loading with the WOx/VOx, atomic ratio = 0.66 exhibits a maximum conversion of similar to 98% in the temperature range 180-240 degrees C, whereas the molybdenum loading showed an inhibition effect on the SCR activity of V/ZrO2 catalyst.

Our best CCD reduced the overvoltage in an alkaline single cell by 270 mV at 300 mA cm(-2) compared to the benchmark, mainly due to the higher catalytic activity and surface area of the Raney nickel electrode. The new electrode system also showed a low degradation rate of 22 mu A cm(-2) h(-1) after 1000 h at a cell voltage of 2 V. The gas purity tests showed that the CCD has hydrogen in oxygen contamination well below the lower explosion limit, even at low current densities. Therefore, we propose the use of our novel CCD architecture for atmospheric alkaline electrolyzers, which have a partly separated electrolyte cycle.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000790544700001

Aimed to overview of antioxidant enzyme gene families and screen for drought and low-temperature response members, the whole apple antioxidant enzyme genes in apple genome were studied. Out of 73candidates in seven antioxidant enzyme gene families among the entire apple genome, a total of 49 genes were identified, showed more antioxidant enzyme gene members than those in other plant species. A phylogenetic tree based on predicted functional domains and motifs of apple and Arabidopsis antioxidant enzymes revealed 19 putative drought or low-temperature response genes, and 9 out 19 genes belong to five families responded to both drought and low-temperature stresses. Subsequently, cis-elements in those nine antioxidant enzyme gene promoters were examined and abundant elements involved in multiple hormone regulation and abiotic stresses response, including drought and low-temperature were found. The tissue expression specificity for those nine members in eight kinds of tissues was also examined. Screening and identifying both drought and low-temperature response genes provide useful information to understand gene functions and promote application of antioxidant enzyme genes in apple abiotic resistance breeding.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			1462-0316	2380-4084		WOS:000434449900001

Long-lived species as indicators of ozone concentration sensitivity								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES				105	D7			9227	9241		10.1029/1999JD900372				APR 16 2000	2000	We used an analysis of radical propagation efficiency and OH chain length in a simple trajectory model to propose combinations of long-lived species that distinguish conditions in which O-3 concentration ([O-3]) is NOx-limited and radical-limited. We further examined these indicators in a three-dimensional grid model. We proposed several new indicators including [H2O2]/([O-3] + [NO2]), [O-3]/[NOx], and a measure using the OH rate constant weighted concentrations of NO2 and hydrocarbons. Our analysis also supports the use of several indicators previously proposed by other researchers, including [O-3]/[HNO3] and [H2O2]/[HNO3]. We found that [HCHO]/[NO2] was more useful than the previously proposed [HCHO]/[NOy]. We found that the indicators easily distinguished extremely NOx-, limited or extremely radical-limited regimes but did not reliably distinguish conditions closer to the transition between these two regimes. We propose that a combined analysis using photochemical model simulations and a large set of indicators of both [O-3] sensitivity and local odd oxygen production (P(O-x)) sensitivity to VOC and NOx provides the most complete and useful description of [O-3] sensitivity. Time series of the indicators, at least from midmorning to late afternoon, provide useful information about the evolution of [O-3] Sensitivity during the day. Values of the indicators change depending on the [O-3] level due in part to the effects of miscellaneous OH and HO2 termination reactions and to the effects of the composition of the HC mixture on P(O-x). Further evaluation of these indicators using modeling studies, measurements, and test cases with NOx or VOC emissions changes are needed to determine how reliably they distinguish NOx- and radical-limited conditions.									65	6	0	0	22	0	71			2169-897X			WOS:000086586400026

We investigated seasonally drained wetland soils from the Pantanal and the Amazon, both with a natural high nitrate content and low pH. Here we report the effect of wetting on the production, emission and consumption of N2O on these soils. Intact soil cores were wetted to simulate natural water logging events, and microsensor measurements were used to i) characterize the vertical microscale distribution of O-2 and N2O, ii) monitor the accumulation of N2O in the anoxic soil volume, and iii) quantify the N2O efflux out of the soil. Flux chamber measurements of N2O emission confirmed the effluxes calculated from microsensor measurements.The N2O concentration dynamics in the soil cores were characterized by three distinct phases: 1) an initial slow N2O production, 2) a higher N2O production ending abruptly when the supply of NO3- and NO2 - (NOx-) was exhausted, and 3) a final phase where the accumulated N2O was reduced to N-2. This evolution of the N2O pool in an intact soil core could be accurately simulated by a simple diffusion-reaction model with the presence of O-2 and NOx- as determining factors.Approximately one third of the initial NO3- present in the soil was lost as N2O or N-2. As the soil was depleted for NO3- by the end of the experiment we suggest that dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA) was responsible for reducing the remaining NO3-.

This horizon has a layered internal structure with variations in composition from dunite to orthopyroxenite and sulfide mineralization enriched in platinum group elements (PGE). All the rocks of the ore horizon include accessory chrome-spinels, which demonstrate a high variability of the composition and are divided into two groups based on their optical properties and chemical composition. Group I chrome-spinels belong to Al-chromites. They occur as homogeneous grains in fine-to-medium-grained orthopyroxenite at the top of the horizon and form cores of zoned chrome-spinels in the medium-to-coarse-grained orthopyroxenite and harzburgite. Group II chrome-spinels belong to Fe-chromites. They form homogeneous grains in dunite and harzburgite and rims of zoned grains in harzburgite. Chemical compositions of Group I chrome-spinels are characterized by high contents of Al2O3 and Cr2O3, an increased MgO but low contents of FeOtot and values of Cr#= Cr/(Cr + Al) and Fe3+# = Fe3+/Fe-tot. Group II chrome-spinels have low Al2O3 and MgO contents, and sharply increased values of Cr# and Fe3+#. This variability in the composition of chrome-spinels is caused by decreasing melt temperature in the process of its cooling during two stages of magmatic crystallization. At the first stage, cumulus crystallization of Group I chrome-spinels and subsolidus diffusion between spinel and olivine ("mineral-mineral" reaction) occurred at a temperature of about 1170 degrees C. At the second stage, reactions between Group I chrome-spinels and intercumulus melt ("mineral-melt" reactions) resulted in the formation of a rims of zoned chrome-spinels and homogeneous Group II chrome-spinels at a temperature of 1070-970 degrees C.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0930-0708	1438-1168		WOS:000679755900001

Here, for the first time, the proof-of-concept is demonstrated by fabricating CoNPs embedded in NH2-MIL-88(Fe) MOFs-derived magnetic carbon (MC) through in situ reduction of cobalt precursors by NaBH4. The obtained CoNPs/MC was characterized by TEM, SEM, XPS, XRD, Raman spectrum, and FT-IR. The CoNPs/MC exhibits much higher peroxidase-like activity than pure CoNPs and magnetic carbon. The high peroxidase-like activity of the CoNPs/MC is attributed to the decomposition of H2O2 to generate center dot OH and O-2(center dot-)-radicals, resulting in TMB color reaction. Also, CoNPs/MC is robust in a wide range of pH and temperature, indicating a promising peroxidase-like candidate. On this basis, a colorimetric assay was developed by combining glucose oxidase with CoNPs/MC for glucose biosensing. The linear range for glucose detection is from 0.25 to 30 mu M with a lower detection limit of 156 nM. The CoNPs/MC-based colorimetric method has been successfully used to assay the content of glucose in real biological samples such as human serums. Our work reveals the high potential of encapsulating metal NPs into carbon materials for the fabrication of nanozymes with stable and high activity. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has developed the ability to take up sterols from the medium under anaerobiosis. Here we investigated sterol uptake efficiency and the expression of genes related to sterol import in Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces wine yeast species fermenting under anaerobic conditions. The sterol uptake efficiency of 39 strains was evaluated by flow cytometry (with 25-NBD Cholesterol, a fluorescent cholesterol probe introduced in the medium) and we found an important discrepancy between Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces wine yeast species that we correlated to a lower final cell population and a lower fermentation rate. A high uptake of sterol was observed in the various Saccharomyces strains. Spot tests performed on 13 of these strains confirmed the differences between Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces strains, suggesting that the presence of the sterol uptake transporters AUS1 and PDR11 could cause these discrepancies. Indeed, we could not find any homologue to these genes in the genome of Hanseniaspora uvarum, H. guillermondii, Lachancea thermotolerans, Torulaspora delbreueckii, Metschnikowia pulcherrima, or Starmarella bacillaris species. The specialization of sterol import function for post genome-duplication species may have favored growth under anaerobiosis.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			1567-1356	1567-1364		WOS:000654733000007	33852000

Herein, zinc atom-doped g-C3N4 and Bi2S3 nanorod heterojunctions (CN-Zn/BiS) are investigated for disinfection under near-infrared light (NIR). The photocatalysis of CN-Zn/BiS is enhanced because of efficient charge separation during the interface electron field and increased oxygen adsorption capacity. Then, 99.2% antibacterial efficiency is shown toward methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 99.6% toward Escherichia coli under 10 min NIR irradiation. Meanwhile, a strategy for the combination of lapsed -lactam antibiotics with the photosensitizer CN-Zn/BiS is provided to kill MRSA by NIR without observable resistance, suggesting an approach to solve the problem of bacterial infection with NIR light penetrability and for exploiting new anti-infection methods. The CN-Zn/BiS nanocomposite can also regulate genes and the inflammatory response through inflammatory factors (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-, and iNOS) in vivo to accelerate tissue regeneration and thereby promote wound healing.									90	4	0	0	27	0	92			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000471335500021		
J	Ma, Tianjin; Wu, Juan; Mi, Yidong; Chen, Qinghua; Ma, Dong; Chai, Chao								Novel Z-Scheme g-C3N4/C@Bi2MoO6 composite with enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity for beta-naphthol degradation								SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY				183				54	65		10.1016/j.seppur.2017.04.005				AUG 7 2017	2017	A novel ternary g-C3N4/C@Bi2MoO6 composite photocatalyst was prepared by a hydrothermal deposition method. Beta naphthol (beta-naphthol) was effectively degraded over g-C3N4/C@Bi2MoO6 composite under visible-light irradiation. The improved photocatalytic activity could be attributed to the efficient separation of photogenerated electrons and holes through the Z-scheme construction of g-C3N4/C@Bi2MoO6. Carbon film acted as an electron mediator to form the charge transmission-bridge between Bi2MoO6 and g-C3N4, which provided sufficient contact area and strong combination between the semiconductors and the electron mediators. The optimized Z-scheme 10%g-C3N4/C@Bi2MoO6 composite showed the highest photocatalytic activity. A possible photocatalytic mechanism of g-C3N4/C@Bi2MoO6 was proposed by a trapping experiment, which could be ascribed to the oxidizing ability of the generated holes and light absorption as well as the reduced the electron-hole pairs recombination with the presence of g-C3N4 and carbon in the composites. The photogenerated holes in the valence band of Bi2MoO6 were the major species in the 3-naphthol photocatalytic degradation process, and the accumulating electrons in the conduction band of g-C3N4 could capture the molecular oxygen to form superoxide radicals to decompose beta naphthol.

J	Zhang, Peng-Fei; Zhou, Mei-Fu; Yumul, Graciano P., Jr.								Coexistence of high-Al and high-Cr chromite orebodies in the Acoje block of the Zambales ophiolite, Philippines: Evidence for subduction initiation								ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS				126						103739	10.1016/j.oregeorev.2020.103739				NOV 2020	2020	The Acoje block of the Eocene Zambales ophiolite (NW, Philippines) is a fragment of forearc lithosphere in the Western Pacific and hosts a world-class chromite deposit. The compositions of chromitites, dunites and harzburgites in the block are used to explore origin of ophiolitic chromite deposits during subduction initiation. Chromite grains in these rocks have a large range of Cr# [100 x Cr/(Cr + Al)]. Those in the cpx-rich harzburgites have the lowest Cr# range (15-35). Those in the chromitites have a bimodal Cr# distribution, similar to 45-48 and 73-76, confirming presence of both high-Al and high-Cr chromitites in the block. Those in the cpx-poor harzburgites and dunites have similar Cr#s, ranging from similar to 35 to 85. The TiO2 contents of chromite grains are generally< 0.25 wt% and increase from the cpx-rich harzburgites to cpx-poor harzburgites, dunite and chromitites. Olivine grains in all the rocks have forsteritic compositions (Fo, 90-93) and delta O-18 values consistent with that of the upper mantle (+5.18 +/- 0.20). The oxygen fugacities (fO(2)) of the harzburgites, dunites and chromitites range from similar to-0.5 log unit below the fayalite-magnetite-quartz (FMQ) buffer to similar to 1.5 log unit above the buffer, generally comparable to or slightly higher than the range of abyssal peridotites. The dataset reveals that parental magmas of the high-Cr chromitites have boninitic affinities, whereas those of the high-Al chromitites have compositions intermediate between MORB and boninitic lavas. Both types of chromitites originated from mantle sources that may have moderately refractory compositions equivalent to residues after similar to 10% melting of fertile MORB mantle, accounting for the low TiO2 contents of chromite in the chromitites. The Acoje mantle wedge was infiltrated by small amounts of slab-derived fluids, which were insufficient to elevate the fO(2) values of peridotites but notably facilitated partial melting in mantle sources of the chromitites. The Acoje mantle sequence was modified by parental magmas of both the high-Al and high-Cr chromitites, causing two different chemical variation trends of peridotites. Peridotites and chromitites in the Acoje mantle sequence record evolving magmatism changing from early MORB-like to later boninitic features, comparable to those developed in the infant IBM arc system, and relevant information can be used for reconstructing the geodynamic evolution of subduction initiation.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			0169-1368	1872-7360		WOS:000588610900002

Such an abundance pattern cannot be explained with any combination of conventional Type I and II supernova yields. In addition, the energy-to-heavy-element mass ratio of the observed hot plasma is much higher than the value resulting from normal supernovae. We calculate abundances for explosive nucleosynthesis in core-collapse hypernovae and show that the abundance pattern and the large ratio between the energy and the heavy-element mass can be explained with hypernova nucleosynthesis. Such hypernova explosions are expected to occur for stars more massive than greater than or similar to20-25 M., and they likely dominate the starburst, because the time since the starburst in M82 is estimated to be as short as similar to10(6)-10(7) yr. We also investigate pair-instability supernovae (similar to150-300 M.) and conclude that the energy-to-heavy-element mass ratio in these supernovae is too small to explain the observation.									28	0	0	0	0	0	28			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000178617600015

By exploiting the combined advantages of holes and graphene, holey graphene based materials have attracted significant interest due to their exceptional properties such as high electrical conductivity and high surface area. These remarkable properties have enabled holey graphene based materials to outperform its pristine form (graphene) and demonstrate their applicability in versatile fields including electrical energy storage (supercapacitors and Li-ion, Li-air, Li-S and Na-ion batteries), energy conversion (electro-water splitting and dye-sensitized solar cells), water desalination, bioseparation, fuel cells, gas sensors, and hydrogen storage and dye degradation systems. As a consequence, it is important to uncover the prime properties and the related potential industrial implications of holey graphene based materials for the development of further research. Hence, in the review, the properties of emerging holey graphene-based materials and various applications including principles, design, fabrication, and engineering aspects are discussed in detail. The recent advances in the state-of-the-art hole generation methods for graphene-based materials along with their working mechanisms, associated issues/solutions, and possible future are discussed. Additionally, the review is aimed at providing critical views on the current status and prospects and generating novel ideas for the development of holey graphene-based materials as a formidable candidate for versatile applications.									43	3	1	0	3	0	43			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000508855700004

Influence of the structure of the molecule on its reactivity								APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL				95	3-4			217	227		10.1016/j.apcatb.2009.12.026				APR 6 2010	2010	Deep oxidation of 48 hydrocarbons (HCs), from 6 to 20 carbon atoms, was studied over a 1%Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (105 m(2) g(-1); mean particle size of Pt: 1 nm). The oxidation reaction (1500 ppm C of HC in air) was carried out by increasing the temperature by step of 5 C from 100 to 400 C. The reactivity of HCs was characterized by their T-50 (temperature at 50% conversion). The reactivity of n-alkanes increases with the chain length, following the same evolution with n as the ionization potential of the molecule. Isoalkanes are more difficult to oxidize than the corresponding n-alkanes. Hydrocarbon reactivity depends on the nature of carbon in the molecule. The ability to be oxidized is greater with C-II and C-III carbons while C-I and C-IV carbons, still more than C-I, are refractory to oxidation. The reactivity of n-alkenes depends relatively little on the number of carbons in the molecule. Light alkenes are much more reactive than light alkanes while the reverse can be observed with long-chain hydrocarbons. Contrary to branched alkanes, isoalkenes or cyclenic hydrocarbons are generally more reactive than the corresponding n-alkenes. Short side-chain alkylbenzenes (toluene, ethylbenzene,...) and polymethylbenzenes are more difficult to oxidize than benzene. When the length of the alkyl group is increased, the behaviour of the hydrocarbon in oxidation resembles more and more to long-chain alkanes with a better oxidability. Polyalkylbenzenes with hindered heavy alkyl groups are quite easy to oxidize. The behaviour of bicyclic or tricyclic hydrocarbons is much more complex. Partial or complete hydrogenation increases their reactivity. For instance, oxidability of bicyclic hydrocarbons is in the order: decaline > tetraline > naphthalene. The reactivity of heavier aromatics also depends on their ability to form partial oxidation intermediates (for instance: fluorene to fluorenone) or to possess extremely rigid internal C=C bonds (for instance: acenaphthylene and acenaphthene). These results were discussed in the light of several factors which can affect the reactivity in oxidation; (i) an electron transfer between adsorbed hydrocarbon and adsorbed oxygen species via the surface metal atoms; (ii) the mean C-H bond strength in the molecule and hindrance effects in branched hydrocarbons; (iii) the relative adsorption strength of oxygen and hydrocarbons; (iv) the relative reactivity of hydrocarbons and partially oxidized molecules, intermediates in total oxidation.

Given this scenario, the development of new catalysts is essential in this field. The emergent demand is the use of Earthabundant elements and catalysts with high performance under mild conditions. Because of this, catalysts such as Prussian Blue analogues (PBA) have been receiving a lot of attention in recent years. In addition, working under neutral conditions allows us to take advantage of the modification of conductive polymeric 3D printed electrodes (3DPE) with Prussian Blue. Thus, we described in this work the development of the polymeric 3D printed electrodes modified by cobalt-Prussian Blue and their performance in the water oxidation process. The 3D printed electrodes modified with Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) (Co-Co PBA) have a Tafel slope of 343 mV dec(-1) while those modified with Co-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) (Co-Fe PBA) have a Tafel slope of 378 mV dec(-1). This means that both catalysts have the same mechanism for the water oxidation process. On the other hand, the overpotential of Co-Co PBA in 3DPE is lower than the value observed by Co-Fe PBA in 3DPE suggesting the best electrocatalytic activity for Co-Co PBA catalyst.									8	0	0	0	1	2	8			0103-5053	1678-4790		WOS:000582805000013

The present work focuses on the excitation of acetone and acetone clusters to the 3d (or perhaps 4s) electronic intermediate state in order to further explore the operative dissociation mechanisms and the effects of solvation (clustering). As reported herein, results from femtosecond pump-probe experiments suggest that the availability of additional vibrational modes in clusters, where internal energy may be dispersed, increases the fraction of acetyl intermediates which remain behind the barrier to dissociation into methyl and CO fragments. At progressively higher laser fluences, multiply charged elemental carbon and oxygen ions abruptly appear. Interestingly, the extent of their formation is observed to depend on both laser intensity and the relative time delay between the pump and probe laser beams responsible for their occurrence.

Recently, plant GSTs have gained a great deal of attention due to their involvement in the detoxification of electrophilic xenobiotics and peroxides under adverse environmental conditions, such as salt, cold, UV-B and drought stress. A previous study reported that a GST gene (CsGSTU8) in tea plant was distinctly induced in response to drought, suggesting this gene plays a critical role in the drought stress response. In this study, by using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter lines, we further demonstrated that CsGSTU8 was upregulated in response to drought stress and exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) treatments. Overexpression of CsGSTU8 in Arabidopsis resulted in enhanced drought tolerance as indicated by the improved scavenging of excess amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under drought conditions. Furthermore, we found that CsWRKY48 acts as a transcriptional activator and that its expression is induced in response to drought stress and ABA treatment. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), dual-luciferase (LUC) assays and transient expression assays in tea plant leaves revealed that CsWRKY48 directly binds to the W-box elements in the promoter of CsGSTU8 and activates its expression. Taken together, our results provide additional knowledge of drought stress responses in tea plant.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			1664-462X			WOS:000738725300001	34956295

Strong anoxic condition prevailed development of bituminous marls of Kazhdumi Formation in central part of the depression. Organic richness, quality, distribution, and maturity of Kazhdumi Formation in northeast margin of Arabian plate (Dezful Embayment, Persian Gulf, Abadan Plain and Fars Region) are evaluated in this study. Rock-Eval pyrolysis data, such as T-max, S-1, S-2, oxygen index (OI), and total organic carbon (TOC), petrographic studies, and burial history information of 64 wells in 37 oil and gas fields and five outcrops are applied to achieve focused aims. Based on the interpretations of TOC and S-2 data, Kazhdumi organic matter richness increases toward Dezful Embayment and the lowest values are recorded in central Persian Gulf (Qatar Arch). Using constructed burial and temperature histories, T-max and vitrinite reflectance (VRr) values, the variation of maturity level are found similar to that of organic matter richness which highest and lowest maturities are observed in Dezful Embayment and Qatar Arch, respectively.

Since the ratio between the two forms of glutathione (GSH/GSSG) is important for the optimal function of GSH to act as an antioxidant against H2O2, the contribution of GSR as an enzymatic regulatory agent to maintain the proper ratio is essential. Abalones are marine mollusks that frequently encounter environmental factors that can trigger the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as H2O2. Therefore, we conducted the current study to reveal the molecular and functional properties of a GSR homolog in the disk abalone, Haliotis discus discus. The identified cDNA sequence (2325 bp) has a 1356 bp long open reading frame (ORF), coding for a 909 bp long amino acid sequence, which harbors a pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase domain (171-246 aa), a pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase dimerization domain, and a NAD(P)(+)-binding Rossmann fold superfamily signature domain. Four functional residues: the FAD binding site, glutathione binding site, NADPH binding motif, and assembly domain were identified to be conserved among the other species. The recombinant abalone GSR (rAbGSR) exhibited detectable activity in a standard glutathione reductase activity assay. The optimum pH and optimal temperature for the reaction were found to be 7.0 and 50 degrees C, respectively, while the ionic strength of the medium had no effect. The enzymatic reaction was vastly inhibited by Cu+2 and Cd+2 ions. A considerable effect of cellular protection was detected with a disk diffusion assay conducted with rAbGSR. Moreover, an MIT assay and flow cytometry confirmed the significance of the protective role of rAbGSR in cell function. Furthermore, AbGSR was found to be ubiquitously distributed in different types of abalone tissues. AbGSR mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in response to three immune challenges: Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Listeria monocytogenes, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), thus indicating its possible involvement in host defense mechanisms during pathogenic infections. Taken together, the results of the current study suggest that AbGSR plays an important role in antioxidant-mediated host defense mechanisms and also provide insights into the immunological contribution of AbGSR.

To prevent this, complete oxidation of chlorobenzene into harmless CO2 is highly desirable. Wet scrubber coupled with advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for gaseous VOCs treatment has been widely reported, but their mineralization capacity and mechanism are still poorly understood. Herein, this study developed an efficient technology for chlorobenzene oxidation via wet scrubbing process coupled with UV/peroxydisulfate (PDS), with UV/H2O2 as comparison. The mineralization efficiency of chlorobenzene was much higher in UV/PDS (75.4%) than that in UV/H2O2 (42.0%), although the removal efficiencies in both AOPs were similar at 90-97%. Sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-) was predominant for the initial oxidation of chlorobenzene, forming the intermediates that were favorable for the mineralization process. Then, O-2 and HO center dot played important roles on the formation of CO2 in the complete oxidation of chlorobenzene in UV/PDS. The role of O-2 was further comfirmed by the result that high toxic dimeric products, rather than CO2, were generated in UV/PDS in the absence of O-2. The possible pathway on chlorobenzene oxidation was proposed based on the evolution of intermediates and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation. Carbon cation radical was formed from the initial oxidation of chlorobenzene by SO4 center dot-, followed by the ring-opening and more CO2 yields via the synergetic effect of SO4 center dot-, O-2 and HO center dot. This study not only provides an environment-friendly method to improve the VOC removal efficiency, but also gets a deep understanding of the different functions of SO4 center dot-, HO center dot and O-2 on the mineralization process.									11	2	0	0	4	0	12			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000569906200002		
J	Ren, Meiyan; Wang, Zhilin; Xue, Min; Wang, Xuefeng; Zhang, Feng; Zhang, Yu; Zhang, Wenjun; Wang, Maoyan								Constitutive expression of an A-5 subgroup member in the DREB transcription factor subfamily from Ammopiptanthus mongolicus enhanced abiotic stress tolerance and anthocyanin accumulation in transgenic Arabidopsis								PLOS ONE				14	10					e0224296	10.1371/journal.pone.0224296				OCT 23 2019	2019	Dehydration-responsive element-binding (DREB) transcription factors (TFs) are key regulators of stress-inducible gene expression in plants. Anthocyanins, an important class of flavonoids, protect plants from reactive oxygen species produced under abiotic stresses. However, regulation of DREBs on anthocyanin accumulation is largely unknown. Here, an A-5 subgroup DREB gene (AmDREB3) isolated from Ammopiptanthus mongolicus, a desert broadleaf shrub with very high tolerance to harsh environments, was characterized in terms of both abiotic stress tolerance and anthocyanin accumulation. AmDREB3 does not contain the transcriptional repression motif EAR, and the protein was located in the nucleus and has transcriptional activation capacity. The transcription of AmDREB3 was differentially induced in the shoots and roots of A. mongolicus seedlings under drought, salt, heat, cold, ultraviolet B, and abscisic acid treatments. Moreover, the transcript levels in twigs, young leaves, and roots were higher than in other organs of A. mongolicus shrubs. Constitutively expressing AmDREB3 improved the tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis to drought, high salinity and heat, likely by inducing the expression of certain stress-inducible genes. The transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings also exhibited an obvious purple coloration and significant increases in anthocyanin accumulation and/or oxidative stress tolerance under drought, salt, and heat stresses. These results suggest that the AmDREB3 TF may be an important positive regulator of both stress tolerance and anthocyanin accumulation.									12	2	0	0	10	0	14			1932-6203			WOS:000532599700065	31644601

The most important aetiological factor associated both with intestinal and diffuse gastric cancer, is Helicobacter pylori. Exposure of gastric epithelial cells to H. pylori results in an inflammatory reaction with the production of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide that, in turn, deaminates DNA causing mutations. The complex interplay between H. pylori strain, inflammation and host characteristics may directly promote diffuse type gastric cancer or induce a cascade of morphological events, i.e. atrophy, intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia, finally leading to intestinal type gastric cancer. Two mechanisms, genetic and epigenetic have been held to play a role in the molecular alterations underlying gastric carcinogenesis. The former, comprising changes in the DNA sequence, is irreversible; the latter, involving DNA methylation, is potentially reversible by eliminating the triggering agents. If H. pylori is eradicated before development of stable mutations, the risk of gastric cancer will likely be prevented. Thus, eradication of H. pylori might immediately reduce the risk of diffuse type gastric cancer, whereas prevention of intestinal type gastric cancer may be less effective if patients are treated later in the evolution of the carcinogenic process.									115	6	2	0	66	1	123			0269-2813	1365-2036		WOS:000222945100002	15274662

Quantitative analysis of the amide I band (1700-1600 cm(-1)) shows that OEC23 contains 5% alpha-helix, 37% beta-sheet, 24% turn, and 34% disorder structures at 25 degrees C. No appreciable conformational changes occur below 45 degrees C. At elevated temperatures, the beta-sheet structure is unfolded into the disorder structure with a major conformational transition occurring at 55 degrees C. Implications of these results for the functions of OEC23 in photosystem II are discussed.

J	Wu Wenhao; Guo Li; Zhang Zhi; Song Jiangfeng; Chen Chang'an; Wang Guangxi							武文浩; 郭莉; 张志; 宋江锋; 陈长安; 王广西	Research Progress of Hydrogen Isotope Solubility Measurement in Liquid Li-Pb Alloy			液态锂铅合金中氢同位素测量研究进展				材料导报	Materials Review				35	10A			19125	19133	1005-023X(2021)35:10A<19125:YTLQHJ>2.0.TX;2-O					2021	2021	Liquid Li-Pb alloy can be used as neutron multiplier, tritium breeder and coolant. Therefore, the liquid Li-Pb alloy cladding is considered as a kind of breeder cladding which has a good prospect in DEMO or fusion power plants. In order to monitor the tritium transportation continuously in Li-Pb breeder cladding module and measure the tritium production rate of the liquid breeder accurately, we need to measure the concentration of hydrogen isotopes on-line in the flowing liquid breeder. The mechanism of the existing sensor is that, to measure the partial pressure of hydrogen in liquid metal by some means, and then to use the Sieverts law for calculation. Especially, the solubility coefficient of hydrogen isotopes is closely related to the accurate measurement of isotope concentration in liquid Li-Pb alloy. At present, the measurement values of hydrogen isotopes solubility coefficient of Li-Pb alloy by teams are quite different. On one hand, due to the extremely low solubility of hydrogen isotopes in liquid Li-Pb alloy, the influence of experimental error cannot be ignored; on the other hand, impurity effect will lead to the difference of solubility coefficient. Oxygen from air, water, CO will be introduced into LiPb to form Li2 O. The reaction with oxygen will consume Li in liquid Li-Pb, which will lead to the decrease of Li activity and the solubility. Therefore, the content control of oxygen or other impurities is important for the practical application of Li-Pb. In recent years, the liquid Li-Pb hydrogen isotope sensors for on-line measurement mainly include metal permeation based sensor and solid electrolyte sensor. The former sensor has simple structure and high reliability. Researchers have made great achievements in material selection and device structure optimization. The current study has confirmed the feasibility of the dynamic measurement mode in the rapid on-line measurement of hydrogen isotope concentration in liquid Li-Pb. Nevertheless the problem to be solved is how to avoid the oxidation of metal probe materials and ensure the stability of long-term work. The solid electrolyte hydrogen sensing technology is relatively mature, but reference gas needs to be introduced during the test, and the toughness of ceramic materials is poor, which requires higher requirements in device structure design and material selection. There are also some on-line hydrogen measurement technology of liquid metal. The probe uses porous ceramics to collect gas, which is mainly used for the measurement of hydrogen concentration in liquid aluminum. For the measurement of hydrogen in liquid Li-Pb alloy, we still need to explore the gas evolution of the material, the compatibility with Li-Pb alloy, and the feasibility of the measurement of very low hydrogen isotope concentration in Li-Pb. In this paper, the factors that affect the solubility of hydrogen isotopes in liquid Li-Pb alloy are briefly introduced, and then the study progress of the solubility coefficient of hydrogen isotopes in liquid Li-Pb alloy is reviewed, including its principle,experimental method and the difference of measurement values by different methods is discussed. In addition, this paper summarizes the investigation on the hydrogen isotope concentration sensor in the liquid Li-Pb alloy. Finally, the device optimization and future development of the hydrogen isotope concentration sensor in the liquid Li-Pb alloy are evaluated.			液态锂铅合金可兼作中子倍增剂、氚增殖剂以及冷却剂,因此液态锂铅合金包层被认为是一种在示范堆(DEMO)或聚变电站中颇有应用前景的增殖包层设计。为了连续监测锂铅增殖包层模块中氚的输运情况,准确、快速测量液态增殖剂的产氚率,需要实时在线测量流动液态增殖剂中氢同位素的浓度。现有传感器都是通过一定手段测定液态金属中的氢分压,然后代入Sieverts定律计算氢同位素浓度,其中氢同位素溶解度系数与同位素浓度的准确测量息息相关。目前氢溶解度系数测量方法主要分为定容法和渗透法,各团队对锂铅合金中氢同位素溶解度系数的测定数值差异较大。一方面由于氢同位素在液态锂铅合金中的溶解度极低,实验误差的影响不可忽视;另一方面杂质效应也会导致溶解度系数的差异,来自空气、水、CO中的氧会引入到锂铅中形成Li2 O,而与氧的反应会消耗液态锂铅合金中的Li,使Li活性降低,进而降低氢同位素的溶解度,因此氧含量以及其他杂质的控制对于锂铅合金的实际应用至关重要。近几年已开发的液态锂铅中氢同位素在线测量传感器主要包括金属渗透窗传感器和固体电解质传感器。金属渗透窗传感器结构简单,可靠性高,研究者们主要从材料选择和器件结构优化等方面不断尝试,并取得了丰硕的成果。目前的研究证实了动态测量模式在液态锂铅中氢同位素浓度快速在线测量方面的可行性,需解决的问题是如何避免金属探头材料的氧化,保证长期工作的稳定性。固体电解质测氢传感技术相对成熟,但陶瓷材料韧性较差,测试时需要通入参考气体,并且在器件结构设计和材料选择方面要求更高。还有一些液态金属在线测氢技术,探头采用多孔陶瓷来收集气体,主要用于铝液中氢浓度的测量。对于液态锂铅合金测氢,仍需探索材料的发气性与锂铅材料的相容性,以及对锂铅中极低氢同位素浓度测量的可行性。本文首先论述了影响氢同位素在液态锂铅合金中溶解度的因素,然后综述了液态锂铅合金中氢同位素溶解度系数的研究进展,包括其原理和研究方法,讨论了不同方法测量数值的差异。此外,本文对在线测量液态锂铅合金中氢同位素浓度传感器的研究进行了概述。最后,对在线测量液态锂铅合金中氢同位素浓度传感器的器件优化和未来发展方向作出了评价。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1005-023X			CSCD:7101521		
J	Lira, R; Ripley, EM; Espanon, AI				Lira, Raúl/I-8455-2019				Meteoric water induced selvage-style greisen alteration in the Achala Batholith, central Argentina								CHEMICAL GEOLOGY				133	1-4			261	277		10.1016/S0009-2541(96)00077-0				NOV 22 1996	1996	Zoned, selvage-style greisen alteration is common along fracture zones in the similar to 350-Ma Achala Batholith of central Argentina. Zonation proceeds from only slightly altered monzogranite, through zones of biotite alteration (Zone 1), partial alteration of feldspar (Zone 2), and intensely altered zones characterized by the complete destruction of feldspar, formation of secondary muscovite, and crystallization of secondary quartz in veins and vugs (Zone 3), Fluid inclusion studies indicate that fluids involved in the formation of secondary quartz were dilute (ave. = 1.5 eq wt% NaCl), and were trapped at temperatures less than similar to 350 degrees C.Oxygen and hydrogen isotopic data collected from primary quartz, feldspar, and muscovite, and secondary muscovite and quartz indicate a complex history of isotopic exchange and mineral precipitation. Feldspar delta(18)O values range from - 3.1 to + 11.6 parts per thousand. whereas primary quartz delta(18)O values are much more restricted at + 120 to + 12.7 parts per thousand. Plots of delta(18)O(fds) vs. delta(18)O(qtz) or delta(18)O(mus) show steep slopes characteristic of kinetically dominated exchange with a low-O-18 fluid. Feldspar, quartz, and primary muscovite delta(18)O values, as well as muscovite delta D values decrease toward Zone 3 and are consistent with a model of fluid advection through fractures and diffusive transport perpendicular to fracture margins. Isotopic data suggest that primary minerals initially exchanged with a fluid of delta D similar to - 175 to - 135 parts per thousand and delta(18)O similar to - 23 to - 18 parts per thousand. However, secondary muscovite and quartz are characterized by delta(18)O values of - 11.6 to - 5.0 parts per thousand and - 16.0 to - 7.1 parts per thousand, respectively. Secondary muscovite delta D values (- 117 to - 83 parts per thousand) are generally higher than those of exchanged, primary muscovite in Zones 2 and 3. Fluid inclusions extracted from late-stage quartz have delta D values of - 55 to - 54 parts per thousand, consistent with computed values for fluid in equilibrium with secondary muscovite. Meteoric water with this hydrogen isotopic composition would be characterized by a delta(18)O value of similar to - 8 parts per thousand, again consistent with delta(18)O(H2O) computed from late-stage secondary muscovite. The data suggest that early isotopic exchange was initiated by reaction with a low-D, low-O-18 meteoric water, but that fluid composition changed through time. Increases in fluid delta(18)O and delta D values may be related to changes in climate and geographic location or elevation of the area, or may in part be related to interaction with evolved fluids that exchanged isotopes in other portions of the flow system. Exchange durations computed from feldspar and quartz delta(18)O values are < 65,000 yr, and indicate that fluid introduction into the fracture system was episodic in nature. Such a pattern of changes with time in the isotopic composition of meteoric water may be characteristic of hydrothermal alteration of back-arc granitoid rocks of the Eastern Sierras Pampeanas.									7	0	0	0	0	3	10			0009-2541			WOS:A1996VX80100016

Endogenous and exogenous factors of the oxidative stress development, including dysfunction of cell oxidoreductase systems, as well as the effects of various external physicochemical factors, are discussed. The review also describes the main components of the antioxidant defense system and stages of its evolution, with a special focus on peroxiredoxins, glutathione peroxidases, and glutathione S-transferases, which share some phylogenetic, structural, and catalytic properties. The substrate specificity, as well as the similarities and differences in the catalytic mechanisms of these enzymes, are discussed in detail. The role of peroxiredoxins, glutathione peroxidases, and glutathione S-transferases in the regulation of hydroperoxide-mediated intracellular and intercellular signaling and interactions of these enzymes with receptors and non-receptor proteins are described. An important contribution of hydroperoxide-reducing enzymes to the antioxidant protection and regulation of such cell processes as growth, differentiation, and apoptosis is demonstrated.									4	0	1	0	3	0	4			0006-2979	1608-3040		WOS:000709365700008	34903155

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were used to investigate the micro morphology and phase of NiO and Ni-Ti-O nanosheets. The methanol catalytic performance and capacitance properties of these electrodes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge tests. The results show that the phase of Ni-Ti-O nanosheets fabricated on 3D porous nickel foam is NiO and TiO with polycrystalline form; The permeation of Ti results in oxygen vacancies in NiO nanosheets and causes synergistic effect with Ni, which makes the electrocatalytic performance of Ni-Ti-O nanosheet electrode for methanol oxidation is much larger than that of Ni(OH)(2) and NiO electrodes; When the mass ratio of the Ni foam and the Ti powder (R-Ni/Ti) is 1:24 and the current density is 5 mA.cm(-2), the area specific capacitance of the Ni-Ti-O electrode is 2.15 F.cm(-2), which is 3.2 times larger than that of Ni(OH)(2)/Ni foam electrode (0.67 F.cm(-2)).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1002-185X			WOS:000449442900031

The organism, designated NT-26, was found to be a gram-negative motile rod with two subterminal flagella. In a minimal medium containing only arsenite as the electron donor (5 mM), oxygen as the electron acceptor, and carbon dioxide-bicarbonate as the carbon source, the doubling time for chemolithoautotrophic growth was 7.6 h. Arsenite oxidation was found to be catalyzed by a periplasmic arsenite oxidase (optimum pH, 5.5). Based upon 16S rDNA phylogenetic sequence analysis, NT-26 belongs to the Agrobacterium/Rhizbium branch of the alpha-Proteobacteria and may represent a new species. This recently discovered organism is the most rapidly growing chemolithoautotrophic arsenite oxidizer known.									347	24	0	0	282	7	376			0099-2240			WOS:000084585800014	10618208

Its presentation is liquid or granulated, being used at concentrations of 5 %, in gardening and 20 % in agricultural use. In human poisoning, the target organ is the lung. The patients develop respiratory insufficiency that can be explained by an initial activity that involves a great oxidative stress, with the presence of oxygen free radicals and lipid peroxidation, with its consequent damages, in addition to polymorphonuclear infiltration that with its liberation reaction worsen pneumonitis. There may be improvement of pneumonitis, but the appearance of pulmonary fibrosis will lead to a lack of response to the administration of oxygen and death due to respiratory failure in a few days to a few weeks. According to the amount ingested, the evolution of the severity of the clinical picture varies. We present two pediatric patients with PQ poisoning, who were started on immunosuppressant treatment after 48 hours of exposure. One of the patients was poisoned incidentally and the other one by suicide. The two patients received similar treatment, however, the patient with suicidal intention died days after the exposure. A review of the literature on the treatment offered is made.	El paraquat (PQ) pertenece al grupo de herbicidas de los bipiridilos.

Los pacientes desarrollan insuficiencia respiratoria que puede explicarse por una inicial actividad que involucra un gran estrés oxidativo, con presencia de radicales libres de oxígeno y peroxidación lipídica, con sus consecuentes daños, además de infiltración por polimorfonucleares que con su reacción de liberación empeoran la neumonitis. Puede haber mejoría de la neumonitis y el daño en algunos órganos, pero pronto la aparición de fibrosis pulmonar lleva a falta de respuesta a la administración de oxígeno y a la muerte por insuficiencia respiratoria en algunos días a semanas.

J	Hatert, Frederic; Ottolini, Luisa; Schmid-Beurmann, Peter								Experimental investigation of the alluaudite plus triphylite assemblage, and development of the Na-in-triphylite geothermometer: applications to natural pegmatite phosphates								CONTRIBUTIONS TO MINERALOGY AND PETROLOGY				161	4			531	546		10.1007/s00410-010-0547-6				APR 2011	2011	In order to assess the stability of the primary alluaudite + triphylite assemblage, we performed hydrothermal experiments between 400 and 800A degrees C, starting from the LiNa(2)Mn (x) Fe (3-x) (2+) Fe(3+)(PO(4))(4) compositions (x = 1.054, 1.502, 1.745) that represent the ideal compositions of the alluaudite + triphylite assemblages from the Kibingo (Rwanda), Hagendorf-Sud (Germany), and Buranga (Rwanda) pegmatites, respectively. The pressure was maintained at 1 kbar, and the oxygen fugacity was controlled by the Ni-NiO buffer. The results of these experiments show that the alluaudite + triphylite assemblage crystallizes at 400 and 500A degrees C, while the association alluaudite + triphylite + mariA double dagger ite appears at 600 and 700A degrees C. The limit between these two domains, at ca. 550A degrees C, corresponds to the maximum temperature that can be reached by the alluaudite + triphylite assemblages in granitic pegmatites, because mariA double dagger ite has never been observed in such geological environments. At 800A degrees C, the formation of the X-phase + triphylite assemblage indicates a strong reduction of the bulk composition, according to the reaction 0.5LiM(2+)PO(4) (triphylite) + 3Na(2)M(2) (2+)Fe(3+)(PO(4))(3) (alluaudite) + 1.5H(2)O = 4.5NaM(2+)PO(4) (mariA double dagger ite) + Li(0.5)Na(1.5)M(5) (2+)(PO(4))(4) (X-phase) + H(3)PO(4) + 0.75O(2) (M(2+) = Fe(2+), Mn). Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) was used at our knowledge for the first time to measure Li in all the Li-bearing phosphates. A specific methodological procedure was developed with the ion microprobe to get accurate Li(2)O data over a wide concentration range spanning from few ppm Li up to similar to 11 wt%. Li(2)O. Our SIMS analyses of the synthesized phosphates indicate that the Li contents of alluaudites, mariA double dagger ites, and X-phase increase progressively with temperature, while the Li content of triphylite-type phosphates decreases due to the Li -> Na substitution. The Na-exchange equilibrium between triphylite-type phosphates and alluaudite is correlated with the temperature according to the equation: ln(x (Na) (Tri) /x (Na) (All) ) = -7.0(7) 10(3)/T + 5.4(9). This equation can be used to estimate the crystallization temperature of triphylite-alluaudite assemblages independently of the oxygen fugacity.									18	2	0	0	0	0	20			0010-7999			WOS:000288169900002

Abundances in a southern sample								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES				138	2			285	296		10.1086/324292				FEB 2002	2002	We have undertaken a large spectroscopic survey of over 80 planetary nebulae with the goal of providing a homogeneous spectroscopic database between 3600 and 9600 Angstrom, as well as a set of consistently determined abundances, especially for oxygen, sulfur, chlorine, and argon. In the current paper we calculate and report the S/O, Cl/O, and Ar/O abundance ratios for 45 southern planetary nebulae (predominantly type II), using our own recently observed line strengths published in a companion paper. One of the salient features of our work is the use of the near-IR lines of [S in] lambdalambda9069, 9532 coupled with the [S in] temperature, to determine the S+2 ionic abundance. We find the following average abundances for these objects: S/O = 0.011 +/- 0.0064, Cl/O = 0.00031 +/- 0.00012, and Ar/O = 0.0051 +/- 0.0020.									31	0	0	0	0	0	31			0067-0049			WOS:000173959700004

Heynh. in response to Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) infection by bioinformatics methods. The transcription profile GSE37269 containing 28 TEV-At17b infected and 25 non-infected samples of A. thaliana was downloaded and used. Limma software in R language was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between mock and infected samples, and Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs were performed. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed by STRING database. Moreover, a weighted gene co-expression network of closely co-expressed DEGs was constructed. Total 1781 DEGs including 873 up-regulated and 908 down-regulated genes were obtained. Up-regulated DEGs were mainly enriched in response to reactive oxygen species, and phenylalanine metabolism as well as biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids, while down-regulated DEGs were mainly enriched in external encapsulating structure organization. Up-regulated genes of AT2G18690 and AT1G19020, down-regulated gene of LAC11 (laccase 11) and IRX12 (iroquois homeobox 12) were hub nodes in PPI network. A significant co-expressed module containing AT5G37485, AT4G36430 and ATH8 (thioredoxin H-type 8) was identified and genes of it were significantly enriched in cellular response to reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. AT4G36430 and ATH8 in the response to hydrogen peroxide and oxidative stress, and some peroxidase-like genes in the secondary metabolic and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, may be responsible for the antiviral response to TEV-At17b infection in A. thaliana.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1021-4437	1608-3407		WOS:000412937200016

Owing to their relatively high stability and activity, iridium (hydr)oxides have been identified as the most promising catalysts for the oxidation of water. Comprehensive spectroscopic and theoretical studies on the basis of rutile IrO2 have provided insight about the electronic structure of the active X-ray amorphous phase. However, due to the absence of long-range order and missing information about the local arrangement of structural units, our present understanding of the active phase is very unsatisfying. In this work, using a combination of real-space atomic scale imaging with atomic pair distribution function analysis and local measurements of the electronic structure, we identify key structural motifs that are associated with high water splitting activity. Comparison of two X-ray amorphous phases with distinctively different electrocatalytic performance reveals that high activity is linked to the ratio between corner- and edge-sharing IrO6 octahedra. We show that the active and stable phase consists of single unit cell sized hollandite-like structural domains that are cross-linked through undercoordinated oxygen/iridium atoms. In the less active phase, the presence of the rutile phase structural motif results in a faster structural collapse and deactivation. The presented results provide insight into the structure activity relationship and promote a rational synthesis of X-ray amorphous IrOx hydroxides that contain a favorable arrangement of structural units for improved performance in catalytic water splitting.									118	4	0	0	6	0	117			0002-7863			WOS:000409286000065	28793758	
J	Yan, Bai-Zhong; Xiao, Chang-Lai; Liang, Xiu-Juan								Evaluation of site and hydrogeochemistry in an urban groundwater source field								WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY				16	2			460	472		10.2166/ws.2015.156				APR 2016	2016	Water demand has increased in metropolitan cities due to fast population growth and industrial development. Jilin City, located in the middle of Jilin province, northeast China, has a population of approximately 4.30 million. The main water source for Jilin City is the Songhua River which has a lot of problems. This study aims to determine the appropriate groundwater resource field for Jilin City by groundwater quantity analysis, groundwater quality analysis and multivariate statistical analysis. Results showed that the groundwater quantity in the study area was separated into four main areas. Most of the study areas had good groundwater supplies. The dominant ions were Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, NH4+, NO3-, HCO3- and SO42-. The groundwater types can be classified as Ca-HCO3, Ca + Mg-HCO3, Ca + Na-HCO3, Ca + HCO3-SO4, Ca + Mg-HCO3 + SO4 and Ca + Na-HCO3 + SO4. The regions of groundwater satisfying the groundwater quality standard can be separated into five main areas. Using principal component analysis (PCA), five principal factors were extracted from the dataset. Factor 1 had high positive loadings for most of the major ions (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3- and SO42-) as well as for total hardness (TH) and electrical conductivity (EC), which represents the natural hydro-geochemical evolution of groundwater by groundwater-geological interaction. Factor 2 was dominated by F-, pH and PO43-, which may be due to anthropogenic pollution sources. Factor 3 was dominated by NO2-, NH4+ and NO3-, which may also be due to anthropogenic pollution sources. Factor 4 had a higher loading of chemical oxygen demand (COD), which again may be due to anthropogenic pollution sources. Factor 5 was dominated by Fe and Mn, which are produced by weathering-leaching-dissolution processes. The score values of the principal factors were influenced by urban land use. Chuanying region is the area in which the quality of groundwater is relatively good. It was determined that No. 6 region in Chuanying region is the groundwater resource field which has sufficient good quality water.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1606-9749			WOS:000374305100022

In our previous research, Pichia caribbica, one of the antagonistic yeasts showed an activity against postharvest diseases of apples, and Vc enhanced the tolerance to oxidative stress of P. caribbica, and improved its biocontrol efficacy to postharvest blue mold decay of apples. However, the mechanisms, especially the molecular mechanisms of the tolerance of P. caribbica improved by Vc under oxidative stress are not sufficiently clear. The purpose of this research was to investigate the protein expression profile and transcriptome characterization of P. caribbica induced by Vc under oxidative stress. The proteomics results showed that there were 31 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), among them 25 DEPs were up-regulated and 6 DEPs were down-regulated. These up-regulated DEPs were associated with the energy metabolism and glucose metabolism, including fructose - bisphosphate aldolase, malate dehydrogenase, peroxisomal catalase and so on. Transcriptomics analysis showed that 68 genes were differentially expressed, among them 38 genes were up-regulated and 30 genes were down-regulated. These up-regulated genes were found to be related to cell wall, energy synthesis, polysaccharides hydrolysis and antioxidant activity.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			1049-9644	1090-2112		WOS:000506878000011

To optimize the growth of the freshwater microalga Chlamydopodium fusiforme and to investigate the cell acclimation process to different amounts of nitrogen, we grew cells in Bristol and BG(11), under fixed conditions of 10 h:14 h light/dark cycle. Cultures grown in BG(11) exhibited higher biomass accumulation, reaching a cell dry weight of 1.94 +/- 0.1 g L-1, while in Bristol it reached 1.58 +/- 0.1 g L-1. In cells grown in BG(11), chlorophyll content increased continuously up to 79.6 mg L-1 (9th day), while in Bristol it was much lower (29.5 mg L-1). This fact caused a strong difference in their spectrally averaged optical cross-section normalized to chlorophyll a (a*), and consequently in their photosynthetic performance (oxygen evolution and electron transport rates). Carotenoid content followed a similar pattern. It was interesting to note that despite this great difference in chlorophyll concentration, both photosynthesis rate and cell dry weight were not affected proportionally. The chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements indicated a stable effective quantum yield of photosystem II in both culture conditions. During the dark phase of the cycle we observed in both cultures a remarkable reduction of both electron transfer and photosynthesis rates, while maximum quantum yield of PSII remained stable (0.74 +/- 0.01). This indicated that the reduction in both photosynthesis rate and maximum electron transport rate (ETRmax) observed during the dark phase were not due to damage of PSII reaction centers but rather to reduced flow of electron subsequent to PSII. Recovery of the fully photosynthetic capacity required about 1 h of illumination.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0921-8971	1573-5176		WOS:000521187500013

However, the low H/C ratio of coal leads to unsatisfactory tar yield and quality. The use of corncob as a hydrogen donor to assist the microwave pyrolysis of low-rank coal through orthogonal-test-based grey relational analysis was investigated. The yield, structure, and component of tar under the optimum conditions were discussed. Results showed that pyrolysis time had the most obvious effect on tar yield, followed by corncob particle size, microwave power, and corncob additive amount, but the difference was small. The maximum tar yield of 8.85% was achieved under the following conditions: microwave power of 700 W, pyrolysis time of 30 min, corncob particle size of 0.420-0.841 mm, and corncob additive amount of 30%. The positive synergistic effect resulted in increased tar yield and decreased long-chain carbon structure and heteroatom organics in tar, thereby producing "lighter " and more "valuable " tar. This positive synergistic effect was due to the H free radicals and reactive oxygen-containing groups produced from corncob cracking.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0959-6526	1879-1786		WOS:000773065600008

Although ferroelectric materials with spontaneous electrical polarization are considered promising light absorbers with the ability to induce oppositely directed transport of photogenerated electrons and holes in the bulk, their applications are intrinsically restricted by the large Schottky barrier at the interface of the ferroelectric material and the co-catalyst, which has a larger work function. Here, we demonstrate that, by selective chemical epitaxial growth of anatase TiO2 islands on the positively poled (00-1) facet of PbTiO3 single-crystal particles to form an atomically smooth interface with a small potential difference, the material shows significantly improved photocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen generation under both UV-visible and visible light, while the island-free PbTiO3 is inactive in visible light. This strategy may be applicable to various ferroelectric materials to produce unusual asymmetric micro-nano structures for excellent performance.									71	3	0	0	5	0	71			2542-4351			WOS:000437403100012

This study used a self-made programmed experimental system to maintain temperature parameters at specified levels to simulate the combustion properties of coal. The oxygen concentration was determined to be inversely proportional to indicator gas concentrations. Five characteristic temperatures were achieved: critical temperature (97.45 +/- 7.15 degrees C), crack temperature (149.28 +/- 8.32 degrees C), active temperature (206.95 +/- 15.05 degrees C), speedup temperature (263.45 +/- 6.35 degrees C), and ignition temperature (390.85 +/- 27.05 degrees C). Thermal characteristics were analyzed by dividing the oxidation into the following temperature stages: the critical temperature stage, crack active speedup temperature stage, speedup ignition temperature stage, and combustion stage. Furthermore, the differential and integral kinetic methods were used to compute the apparent activation energy in the four aforementioned stages. The results indicated that the apparent activation energies decreased through the first three stages and then increased in the fourth stage. Therefore, the crack active speedup temperature stage was determined to be potentially dangerous during oxidation because gases increased rapidly at this stage; such gases included CO, which is particularly harmful to human health. The thermal energy release also increased gradually at this stage. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein we show the design and synthesis of the hierarchical chromic oxide-octahedral porous carbon (Cr2O3@OPC) composites catalyst with octahedral shape that derived from Cr-based metal-organic frameworks (MIL-101(Cr)) precursor. When applied as cathode catalysts in rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries, the electrode with Cr2O3@OPC composites catalyst exhibits a low charge and discharge over-potential, high discharge capacity and excellent cycling stability. What's more, the electrode with Cr2O3@OPC composite shows a discharge capacity up to similar to 4800 mAh g((catalyst + carbon))(-1) at a current density of 0.1 mA cm(-2), and exhibits a very stable discharge voltage plateau of 2.7 V and a charge voltage plateau of similar to 3.9 V. With the addition of Cr2O3@OPC composite, the Li-O-2 batteries can obtain good cycle performance over 50 cycles at a fixed capacity of 800 mAh g((catalyst + carbon))(-1). These results indicating that the Cr2O3@OPC composite derived from MIL-101(Cr) would be a promising catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, commercial lead dioxide as a traditional anodic electrocatalyst is highly toxic and has low durability, and exploring anodic electrocatalysts with lower lead content and performance loss is challenging. Herein, a series of pyramidal sillenite-type Bi12PbO20 materials were designed and fabricated with a hydrothermal method in which Pb was introduced to Bi2O3 frameworks. The product, Bi12PbO20-3, exhibited remarkable EOP performance, with faradaic efficiency of 15.1% at 50 mA cm(-2) in a neutral solution, which was almost 1.5 times that of commercial beta-PbO2. Computational simulations further demonstrated that the confined [Pb-O-4] fragment was confined in the Bi-O bonding environment of Bi12PbO20, the low oxygen vacancy formation energy resulted from the weak Pb-O interaction and remarkably enhanced EOP activity. Such a local confined environment plays a vital role in suppressing Pb loss, thereby accounting for the robust EOP stability. Additionally, the significant performance of the membrane electrode assembly system in the electrochemical degradation of antibiotics and pesticides implied the potential environmental application capabilities of Bi12PbO20.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000755914000001

Herein, transition-metal (TM) doped titanate nanowires (TNWs) were prepared via ion-exchange over the titanate precursors and demonstrated for the Rhodamine B (RhB) degradation under ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation. The ion-exchange of selective ions (V5+, Cr3+, Ni2+, and Zn2+) with protons from pristine TNWs resulted in the hierarchical meso-porosity of nanowires with large pores of similar to 5-20 nm by TM doping and small pores of similar to 3.6-4.5 nm inherited from pristine TNWs, which facilitates the mass transfer while maintaining high surface area and active sites. Meanwhile, the TM intercalation partially reduces the Ti4+ to Ti3+ and narrows the optical bandgap, which, together with oxygen vacancies and superoxide radicals from pristine TNWs, enhance the adsorption and photocatalytic degradation performance of RhB. This work helps to elucidate the effects of transition-metal doping and provides a rational strategy towards high performance titanate-based photocatalysts for efficient and sustainable wastewater treatment.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000790051700003

To improve the dispersion efficiency of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in the molybdenum (Mo) matrix, acid treatment was used to de-agglomerate CNTs. Carbon nanotube/hafnium hydride (CNT/HfH2) powder prepared by wet dispersion and the powder subsequently milled with Mo through HEBM to fabricate MHC composite powder. The results show that this powder metallurgy process improved the dispersion uniformly of HfC and grain size. The strengthening mechanism of dispersion strengthening, grain refinement, lattice distortion and purification of free oxygen improved the relative density, microstructures and mechanical properties of the CNT-reinforced MHC composites. As a result, compared to other control groups and Mo based composites, the 30 h ball milling time of CNT-reinforced MHC composite (30 h composite) exhibits simultaneous enhancement in relative density, mechanical properties and improvement in microstructure. This work provides a feasible way to fabricate high-performance Mo matrix composites. (C) 2020 The Authors.

XPS results confirmed the presence of F- ion on the surface and also in the bulk lattice. Energy levels like Ti3+ - V-o states and oxygen vacancies (V-o) existing as neutral/singly ionized (F+ center)/doubly ionized (F center) states and the dopant energy levels are responsible for the visible light photocatalytic activity of the doped samples. Further the surface fluorine acts as an efficient electron trapping center due to the high electronegativity of F- ions and it also hinders the electron hole recombination. The existence of the above energy states are confirmed by the XPS and PL techniques. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the synergistic effects of both surface and bulk fluorine ions in the SrTiO3 lattice.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			0009-2614	1873-4448		WOS:000514221000014

II. EXPLOSION								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				695	2			1257	1272		10.1088/0004-637X/695/2/1257				APR 20 2009	2009	Observational evidences point to a common explosion mechanism of Type Ia supernovae based on a delayed detonation of a white dwarf (WD). However, all attempts to find a convincing ignition mechanism based on a delayed detonation in a destabilized, expanding, white dwarf have been elusive so far. One of the possibilities that has been invoked is that an inefficient deflagration leads to pulsation of a Chandrasekhar-mass WD, followed by formation of an accretion shock that confines a carbon-oxygen rich core, while transforming the kinetic energy of the collapsing halo into thermal energy of the core, until an inward moving detonation is formed. This chain of events has been termed Pulsating Reverse Detonation (PRD). In this work, we present three-dimensional numerical simulations of PRD models from the time of detonation initiation up to homologous expansion. Different models characterized by the amount of mass burned during the deflagration phase, M-defl, give explosions spanning a range of kinetic energies, K similar to (1.0-1.2) x 10(51) erg, and Ni-56 masses, M(Ni-56) similar to 0.6-0.8 M-circle dot, which are compatible with what is expected for typical Type Ia supernovae. Spectra and light curves of angle-averaged spherically symmetric versions of the PRD models are discussed. Type Ia supernova spectra pose the most stringent requirements on PRD models.									33	1	0	0	0	0	33			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000265018300043

Herein, we design an easy, cheap, scalable, and eco-friendly carbothermal reduction strategy to develop core-shell structured metallic iron nanoparticles using coffee waste grounds as starting renewable materials (Fe@BMC). The structural properties of the as-synthesized nanoparticles were nicely tuned by varying the reaction temperature. Remarkably, ultrathin carbon-shell coated metallic iron nanoparticles were obtained at 800 degrees C, which was clearly elucidated by the HRTEM, XRD, and XPS measurements. The Fe-800 degrees C@BMC nanocatalyst showed excellent properties as an ORR electrocatalyst with an onset potential of 0.93 V vs RHE, keeping 90% of the initial current applied after the 20000s. Noticeably, the Fe-800 degrees C@BMC carbon-shell nanostructures delivered a Pt-like performance with a very low onset potential of -25 mV vs RHE, an overpotential of 75 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and an ultrahigh stability to keep the 99% of the initial current applied after 20000s, behaving like one of the most efficient HER core-shell structured non-precious electrocatalysts reported up to now. Also, the Fenton like catalytic studies revealed that the Fe-800 degrees C@BMC nanocatalyst was so far the most active catalyst for the degradation of tetracycline (TC) antibiotic allowing the degradation of 95.72% of TC in 45 min with a higher reaction rate constant of 0.068 min(-1). The impressive catalytic behavior of the Fe-800 degrees C@BMC nanocatalyst was attributed to the hierarchically porous carbon network as well as to the synergistic interaction between the encapsulated metallic iron core and the ultrathin carbon shell, which regulate the adsorption energy of the reactive species.

J	Qiu, Yanling; Liu, Zhiqiang; Zhang, Xinyue; Sun, Aowei; Liu, Jingquan								Synergistic effect of oxidation etching and phase transformation triggered by controllable ion-bath microenvironments toward constructing ultra-thin porous nanosheets for accelerated industrial water splitting at high current density								JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE				625				50	58		10.1016/j.jcis.2022.05.162				NOV 2022	2022	Precisely tailoring the structure of inorganic materials at the micron and nanometer scales, especially in collaboration with component customization to design efficient, stable and low-cost transition-metal-based catalysts for industrial electrocatalytic water splitting (EWS) is a key renewable energy technology, but still facing a daunting challenge. Here, the controllable escape of Ni atom is adopted to disturb the hydrothermal ion-bath environment, thereby resulting in the coexistence of high valence Ni and Fe ions. Combined with a one-step hydrothermal coordination strategy, the timeline-adjusted ion-bath microenvironment can effectively trigger the phase transformation of carbonate hydroxide hydrate nanosheets (NFCH) to nickel ferrite intercalated NFCH ultra-thin porous nanosheets (NF-CH-O). Thanks to the high-energy phase boundary synergistic effect and the rapid mass transfer advantages of ultra-thin porous nanostructures, the as-prepared NF-CH-O nanosheets exhibit remarkable oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER/HER) catalytic activity and stability, with low overpotentials of 207/191 mV at 50 mA cmz, respectively, as well as the activity retention for 100 h. The alkaline water electrolyzer set up with NF-CH-O as both anodic and cathodic electrodes only requires a cell potential of 1.688 V to reach 50 mA cm(-2) in a continuous operation of 100 h. More impressively, NF-CH-O only requires overpotentials of 266, 292 mV and 1.877 V to drive high current densities up to 500 mA cm(-2) for OER, HER and EWS, respectively, and exhibits excellent stability with a reduction in the activity of less than 10% over cycles of more than 65 h. This work highlights the room-temperature controllable ion-bath oxidative etching strategy to design efficient bifunctional catalysts with ultra-thin porous structure and high-current-density activity. Meanwhile, combined with the advantages of direct growth on the substrate for mass production, such meticulous consideration of nanostructured design will be more competitive in the H-2-production industry.

It uses light energy to split water into molecular oxygen and reducing equivalents. PSII can be isolated with varying degrees of complexity in terms of its subunit composition and activity, To date, no three-dimensional (3-D) structure of the PSII complex has been determined which allows location of the proteins within the PSII complex and their orientation in relation to the thylakoid membrane.Results: Two-dimensional (2-D) PSII core complex crystals composed of the two reaction centre proteins, D1 and D2, two chlorophyll-binding proteins, CP47 and CP43, cytb559 and associated low molecular weight proteins were formed after reconstituting the isolated complex into purified thylakoid lipids. Electron micrographs of negatively stained crystals were used for 2-D and 3-D image analyses. In the resulting maps, the PSII complex is composed of two halves related by twofold rotational symmetry, thus, confirming the dimeric nature of the complex; each monomer appears to contain five domains, Comparison of the 3-D images with platinum shadowed images of the crystals allowed the likely lumenal and stromal surfaces of the complex to be identified and regions contained within the membrane to be inferred. The projection structure of 2-D crystals of a smaller CP47-D1-D2-cytb559 complex was used to identify the domains apparently associated with CP43.Conclusion: The results indicate that PSII probably exists as a dimer in vivo. The extensive proteinaceous protrusions from the lumenal surface have been tentatively assigned to hydrophilic loops of CP47 and CP43; the positioning of these loops possibly implies their involvement in the water-splitting process.									56	1	0	0	45	0	57			0969-2126	1878-4186		WOS:A1997XJ90900011	9261075

Highest concentrations of the alkaloid are found in inflorescences, suggesting a defence role. Brachycerine has antimutagenic and antioxidant properties, capable of quenching singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radical, and superoxide. This study aimed at characterizing the putative role of brachycerine in P. brachyceras responses to wounding and herbivory. Damage to leaves increased the content of brachycerine locally. Wounding did not affect phenolics content in P. brachyceras leaves, and no tannins were detected in the species. In generalist herbivore bioassays, neither brachycerine nor P. brachyceras extracts showed toxic effects. In vivo hydrogen peroxide staining assay showed less wound-generated peroxide accumulation in alkaloid treated tissues. This pattern was confirmed in quantitative assays measuring tissue hydrogen peroxide concentrations. Data indicate that brachycerine is not a herbivore deterrent, but rather an indirect chemical defence, modulating oxidative stress caused by mechanical damage.									11	0	0	0	8	2	11			1934-578X	1555-9475		WOS:000336512700009	25026705

Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that all retrieved sequences were clearly different from typical denitrifiers' nirS, but do group together with the known anammox bacterial nirS. Sequences targeted by ScnirS are closely related to Scalindua nirS genes recovered from the Peruvian oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), whereas sequences targeted by AnnirS are more closely affiliated with the nirS of Candidatus 'Kuenenia stuttgartiensis' and even form a new phylogenetic nirS clade, which might be related to other genera of the anammox bacteria. Analysis demonstrated that retrieved sequences had higher sequence identities (> 60%) with known anammox bacterial nirS genes than with denitrifiers' nirS, on both nucleotide and amino acid levels. Compared to the 165; rRNA and hydrazine oxidoreductase (hzo) genes, the anammox bacterial nirS not only showed consistent phylogenetic relationships but also demonstrated more reliable quantification of anammox bacteria because of the single copy of the nirS gene in the anammox bacterial genome and the specificity of PCR primers for different genera of anammox bacteria, thus providing a suitable functional biomarker for investigation of anammox bacteria.									71	5	0	0	64	0	75			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000289341300051	21417444	
J	Li, Chuxuan; Tang, Lu; Jiang, Jun; Zhu, Feng; Zhou, Jingju; Xue, Shengguo								Alkalinity neutralization and structure upgrade of bauxite residue waste via synergistic pyrolysis with biomass								JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES				93				41	47		10.1016/j.jes.2020.03.012				JUL 2020	2020	Bauxite residues, a large volume solid waste, are in urgent need of effective disposal and management. Especially, strategies to alleviate the high alkalinity of bauxite residue remain a big challenge. Here, we developed a synergistic pyrolysis to neutralize the alkalinity of bauxite residue and upgrade the structure of biomass simultaneously. By cooperating the catalytic feature from bauxite residue, rice straw, a cellulose-enriched biomass, could prefer to produce acidic components under a hypothermal pyrolysis temperature (below 250 degrees C) and partial oxygen-contained atmosphere as evidenced by the synchronous TGA-FTIR analysis. In return, these in-situ produced acidic components neutralized the bauxite residue profoundly (pH decreased from 11.5 to 7.2) to obtain a neutral product with long-term water leaching stability. Also, a higher pyrolysis temperature led to neutral biochar-based products with well-defined carbonization characteristics. Thus, the biomass-driven pyrolysis strategy provides a potential to dispose the alkalinity issue of bauxite residue and further opportunities for the sustainable reuse and continuing management of bauxite residue.

The first of these generates a tertiary alcohol at the C-20 position of precorrin-3A by functioning as a monooxygenase, a reaction that also forms a gamma lactone with the acetic acid side chain on ring A. The product, precorrin-3B, is then acted upon by CobJ, which methylates at the C-17 position and promotes ring contraction of the macrocycle by catalyzing a masked pinacol rearrangement. Here, we report the characterization of CobG enzymes from Pseudomonas denitrificans and Brucella melitensis. We show that both contain a [4Fe-4S] center as well as a mononuclear non-heme iron. Although both enzymes are active in vivo, the P. denitrificans enzyme was found to be inactive in vitro. Further analysis of this enzyme revealed that the mononuclear non-heme iron was not reducible, and it was concluded that it is rapidly inactivated once it is released from the bacterial cell. In contrast, the B. melitensis enzyme was found to be fully active in vitro and the mononuclear non-heme iron was reducible by dithionite. The reduced mononuclear non-heme was able to react with the oxygen analogue NO, but only in the presence of the substrate precorrin-3A. The cysteine residues responsible for binding the Fe-S center were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. A mechanism for CobG is presented.									10	0	0	0	11	0	11			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000263416600007	19068481

Herein, a simple method was used to prepare the porous g-C3N4 nanosheets by introducing NH4HCO3 as pore former. The asprepared porous g-C3N4 showed a larger specific surface area, which was 56.47% larger than control. And the abundant porous structure promoted the electron transfer and inhibited the recombination of photoexcited electron and hole pairs. Furthermore, the photodegradation performance of as-prepared porous g-C3N4 was superior than control, the degradation efficiency for sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was 93.37%, which was 26.42% higher than control. Radicals like O-center dot(2)- and (OH)-O-center dot were proved to be the main active species for SMX degradation after the reactive oxygen species trapping experiments and investigation of the impacts of different pH value on the photodegradation efficiencies. The intermediates were identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and the degradation pathways of SMX were proposed. The results showed that porous g-C3N4 had an excellent performance for the degradation of SMX.									14	0	0	0	5	0	14			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000509611400036		
J	Roy, Shweta; Nandi, Ashis Kumar								Arabidopsis thaliana methionine sulfoxide reductase B8 influences stress-induced cell death and effector-triggered immunity								PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY				93	1-2			109	120		10.1007/s11103-016-0550-z				JAN 2017	2017	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) oxidize methionine to methionine sulfoxide (MetSO) and thereby inactivate proteins. Methionine sulfoxide reductase (MSR) enzyme converts MetSO back to the reduced form and thereby detoxifies the effect of ROS. Our results show that Arabidopsis thaliana MSR enzyme coding gene MSRB8 is required for effector-triggered immunity and containment of stress-induced cell death in Arabidopsis.Plants activate pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), a basal defense, upon recognition of evolutionary conserved molecular patterns present in the pathogens. Pathogens release effector molecules to suppress PTI. Recognition of certain effector molecules activates a strong defense, known as effector-triggered immunity (ETI). ETI induces high-level accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hypersensitive response (HR), a rapid programmed death of infected cells. ROS oxidize methionine to methionine sulfoxide (MetSO), rendering several proteins nonfunctional. The methionine sulfoxide reductase (MSR) enzyme converts MetSO back to the reduced form and thereby detoxifies the effect of ROS. Though a few plant MSR genes are known to provide tolerance against oxidative stress, their role in plant-pathogen interaction is not known. We report here that activation of cell death by avirulent pathogen or UV treatment induces expression of MSRB7 and MSRB8 genes. The T-DNA insertion mutant of MSRB8 exaggerates HR-associated and UV-induced cell death and accumulates a higher level of ROS than wild-type plants. The negative regulatory role of MSRB8 in HR is further supported by amiRNA and overexpression lines. Mutants and overexpression lines of MSRB8 are susceptible and resistant respectively, compared to the wild-type plants, against avirulent strains of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst) carrying AvrRpt2, AvrB, or AvrPphB genes. However, the MSRB8 gene does not influence resistance against virulent Pst or P. syringae pv. maculicola (Psm) pathogens. Our results altogether suggest that MSRB8 function is required for ETI and containment of stress-induced cell death in Arabidopsis.									25	0	0	0	19	0	25			0167-4412	1573-5028		WOS:000393303400008	27900506

To further understand how these parasites survive in the host, we cloned and expressed T. carassii glycoprotein 63 (Tcagp63), and generated a rabbit polyclonal antibody to the recombinant protein (rTcagp63). Tcagp63 was similar to gp63 of other trypanosomes and grouped with Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei gp63 in phylogenetic analysis. We showed that rTcagp63 down-regulated Aeromonas salmonicida and recombinant goldfish TNF alpha 2-induced production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates. Macrophages treated with rTcagp63 also exhibited significant reduction in the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-A, TNF alpha-1 and TNF alpha-2. Recombinant Tcagp63 bound to and was internalised by goldfish macrophages. The Tcagp63 may act by altering the signalling events important in downstream monocyte/macrophage antimicrobial and other cytokine-induced functions. We believe that this is the first report on downregulation of antimicrobial responses by trypanosome gp63. (C) 2012 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a one-pot synthetic strategy to oxygen-rich porous nitrogen-doped carbon (OPNC) is developed through pyrolysis of ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid tetra-sodium in air without any activation and functionalization agents. The as-prepared OPNC with more surface oxygenated groups and mesopores not only benefits synthesis of well-dispersed ultrafine Rh nanoparticles (NPs) with abundant accessible active sites, but also facilitates the diffusion of reactants and avoids mass transfer limitations, thereby considerably contributes to a high performance toward AB hydrolysis. Specifically, the optimal Rh/OPNC exhibits a high activity toward AB hydrolysis with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 433 min(-1). The kinetic isotope studies indicate that the cleavage of O-H bond in H2O molecules is the rate-determining step (RDS). The Rh/ OPNC can be reused for five repetitive cycles with approximately 62% remained activity of the first cycle. The catalytic activity of Rh/OPNC can be further improved with a very high TOF of 1201 min(-1) in alkaline solution. This study proposes a simple and sustainable pathway to synthesize efficient catalyst support for depositing metal NPs toward AB hydrolysis. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Among these substances Miller identified different amino acids, and he concluded that prebiotic events may well have produced many of Life's molecular building blocks. There have been many variants of the original experiment since, including different gas mixtures (Miller, J Am Chem Soc 77: 2351-2361, 1955; Oro, Nature 197: 862-867, 1963; Schlesinger and Miller, J Mol Evol 19: 376-382, 1983; Miyakawa et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci 99:14,628-14,631, 2002). Recently some of Miller's remaining original samples were analyzed with modern equipment (Johnson et al. Science 322:404-404, 2008; Parker et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci 108: 5526-5531, 2011) and a total of 23 racemic amino acids were identified. To give an overview of the chemical variety of a possible prebiotic broth, here we analyze a "Miller type" experiment using state of the art mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. We identify substances of a wide range of saturation, which can be hydrophilic, hydrophobic or amphiphilic in nature. Often the molecules contain heteroatoms, with amines and amides being prominent classes of molecule. In some samples we detect ethylene glycol based polymers. Their formation in water requires the presence of a catalyst. Contrary to expectations, we cannot identify any preferred reaction product. The capacity to spontaneously produce this extremely high degree of molecular variety in a very simple experiment is a remarkable feature of organic chemistry and possibly prerequisite for Life to emerge. It remains a future task to uncover how dedicated, organized chemical reaction pathways may have arisen from this degree of complexity.									21	0	0	0	10	0	21			0169-6149	1573-0875		WOS:000385183300001	26508401

TiO2(H) was obtained from hollandite K0.21TiO2 by an oxidation-ion extraction process. Na/TiO2(H) cells exhibit a large first discharge capacity of 280 mA h g(-1) down to 0.2 V. After the first discharge the Na/TiO2(H) cells develop a reversible charge-discharge capacity of 85 mA h g(-1) at C/8 rate in the 2.5-0.2 V voltage range; this corresponds to the reversible insertion of 0.25 Na per TiO2(H) formula unit. Chronoamperometry and potentiostatic intermittent titration techniques were used to further characterize the electrochemical reaction mechanism. Structural changes in the TiO2(H) electrode upon sodium insertion and extraction have been studied by ex situ XRD and high resolution in situ synchrotron diffraction techniques, for which appropriately modified coin-type cells were used. It is seen that sodium insertion into TiO2(H) is commenced with a single-phase solid solution followed by a structural transition from tetragonal I4/m to monoclinic I2/m symmetry, in which the skeleton framework is retained. The reversible transition includes few structural changes with a small volume change of only 1.1%. Fourier difference maps deduced from SXRD patterns revealed the location of Na ions in 4i sites in the tunnel space. The coordination arrangement around Na ions is distorted capped trigonal prisms formed by seven oxygen atoms. Although still far from the theoretical capacity (335 mA h g(-1)), the cycling properties at a low insertion potential together with the host framework stability indicate the feasibility of TiO2 with the hollandite structure as a negative electrode material for Na-ion batteries.									78	4	0	0	2	0	79			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000329935700031

The formulation, potentially applicable to general mechanobiological processes, is here used to study the engineered cultivation in bioreactors of articular chondrocytes, a process of Regenerative Medicine characterized by a complex interaction among spatial scales (from nanometers to centimeters), temporal scales (from seconds to weeks) and biophysical phenomena (fluid-controlled nutrient transport, delivery and consumption; mechanical deformation of a multiphase porous medium). The principal contribution of this research is the inclusion of the concept of cellular "force isotropy'' as one of the main factors influencing cellular activity. In this description, the induced cytoskeletal tensional states trigger signalling transduction cascades regulating functional cell behavior. This mechanims is modeled by a parameter which estimates the influence of local force isotropy by the norm of the deviatoric part of the total stress tensor. According to the value of the estimator, isotropic mechanical conditions are assumed to be the promoting factor of extracellular matrix production whereas anisotropic conditions are assumed to promote cell proliferation. The resulting mathematical formulation is a coupled system of nonlinear partial differential equations comprising: conservation laws for mass and linear momentum of the growing biomass; advection-diffusion-reaction laws for nutrient (oxygen) transport, delivery and consumption; and kinetic laws for cellular population dynamics. To develop a reliable computational tool for the simulation of the engineered tissue growth process the nonlinear differential problem is numerically solved by: (1) temporal semidiscretization; (2) linearization via a fixed-point map; and (3) finite element spatial approximation. The biophysical accuracy of the mechanobiological model is assessed in the analysis of a simplified 1D geometrical setting. Simulation results show that: (1) isotropic/anisotropic conditions are strongly influenced by both maximum cell specific growth rate and mechanical boundary conditions enforced at the interface between the biomass construct and the interstitial fluid; (2) experimentally measured features of cultivated articular chondrocytes, such as the early proliferation phase and the delayed extracellular matrix production, are well described by the computed spatial and temporal evolutions of cellular populations.					22nd Congress of the Associazione-Italiana-di-Meccanica-Teorica-e-Applicata (AIMETA)22nd Congress of the Associazione-Italiana-di-Meccanica-Teorica-e-Applicata (AIMETA)	SEP, 2015SEP, 2015	Assoc Italiana Meccanica Teorica & ApplicataAssoc Italiana Meccanica Teorica & Applicata	Genoa, ITALYGenoa, ITALY	12	1	0	0	2	0	13			0025-6455	1572-9648		WOS:000414398600002	32009677	
J	Havaux, M; Guedeney, G; He, QF; Grossman, AR				He, Qingfang/I-4181-2013				Elimination of high-light-inducible polypeptides related to eukaryotic chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins results in aberrant photoacclimation in Synechocystis PCC6803								BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-BIOENERGETICS				1557	1-3			21	33		10.1016/S0005-2728(02)00391-2				MAR 6 2003	2003	The hli genes, present in cyanobacteria, algae and vascular plants, encode small proteins [high-light-inducible polypeptides (HLIPs)] with a single membrane-spanning alpha-helix related to the first and third helices of eukaryotic chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins. The HLIPs are present in low amounts in low light and they accumulate transiently at high light intensities. We are investigating the function of those polypeptides in a Synechocystis PCC6803 mutant lacking four of the five hli genes. Growth of the quadruple hli mutant was adversely affected by high light intensities. The most striking effect of the quadruple hli mutation was an alteration of cell pigmentation. Pigment changes associated with cell acclimation to increasing light intensity [i.e. decrease in light-harvesting pigments, accumulation of the carotenoid myxoxanthophyll and decrease in photosystem I (PSI)-associated chlorophylls] were strongly exacerbated in the quadruple hli mutant, resulting in yellowish cultures that bleached in high light and died as light intensities exceeded (>500 mumol photon m(-2) s(-1)). However, these pigment changes were not associated with an inhibition of photosynthesis, as probed by in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence, photoacoustic and O-2-evolution measurements. On the contrary, the HLIP deficiency was accompanied by a stimulation of the photochemical activity, especially in high-light-grown cells. Western blot analyses revealed that the PSI reaction center level (PsaA/B) was noticeably reduced in the quadruple,hli mutant relative to the wild type, whereas the abundance of the PSII reaction center protein D I was comparatively little affected. The hli mutations did not enhance photoinhibition and photooxidation when cells were exposed over a short term to a very high light intensity. Together, the results of this study indicate that HLIPs are critical in the adaptation of the cyanobacterium. to variations in light intensity. The data are consistent with the idea that HLIPs are involved, through a direct or indirect means, in nonphotochemical dissipation of absorbed light energy. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, previous studies mainly focused on cool flames in homogenous systems without transport or non-premixed cool flames in droplet combustion or counterflow configuration. There are only a few studies on premixed cool flames, and the transient initiation and propagation of premixed cool flames are still not well understood. In this study, the initiation, propagation and disappearance of one-dimensional premixed cool flames in dimethyl ether (DME)/air mixture is investigated through transient simulation considering detailed chemistry and transport. The premixed cool flame governed by LTC can be initiated by a hot spot. When the hot spot temperature is not high enough to directly trigger the high-temperature chemistry (HTC), only the LTC reactions take place initially and thereby a cool flame is first initiated. During the cool flame propagation, HTC autoignition occurs at the hot spot and it induces a hot flame propagating behind the cool flame. Therefore, double-flame structure for the coexistance of premixed cool and hot flames is observed. Since the hot flame propagates much faster than the cool flame, it eventually catches up and merges with the leading cool flame. A well-defined cool flame speed is found in this study. We inverstigate different factors affecting the cool flame speed and the appearance of hot flame. It is found that at higher equivalence ratio, higher initial temperature or higher oxygen concentration, the premixed cool flame propagates faster and the hot flame appears earlier. Three chemical mechanisms for DME oxidation are considered. Though these three mechanisms have nearly the same prediction of hot flame propagation speed, there are very large discrepancy in the prediction of cool flame propagation speed. Therefore, experimental data of premixed cool flame speed are useful for developing LTC. (C) 2017 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Herein, Cu+ doped W18O49 nanowires were prepared by a facile solvothermal method and applied in photocatalytic reduction of CO2. The composition and structure of pristine and Cu' doped W18O49 samples have been characterized. It was found that the morphology of W18O49 nanowires was changed with increasing amounts of dopant. The photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of W18O49 nanowires and the Cu' doped W18O49 samples were evaluated using H2O as reducing agent. The strategy of Cu+ doping not only could affect the band edge position and the surface wettability, but also influenced separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs. It was found that Cu+ doping could introduce oxygen vacancy and change the conduction edge to a more negative position for W18O49 nanowires, which might be beneficial for the activation of CO2 and promote the following CO2 reduction. Furthermore, the higher separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs with Cu' doping could contribute to the CO2 photoreduction enhancement. In addition, the Cu+ doped W18049 nanowires (Cu-W18O49-0.005) presented a relatively poor hydrophilic property, which might be beneficial for the adsorption of CO2 molecules and contribute to its superior photocatalytic CO2 reduction capability.

The functional diversity of GAPDH from Dunaliella bardawil (DbGAPDH) may relate to the regulatory elements lying in the promoter at the transcriptional level. Using RT-PCR and RACE reactions, gapdh cDNA was isolated, and the full-length genomic sequence was obtained by LA-PCR-based genome walking. The full-length cDNA sequence was 1645 bp containing an 1128 bp putative open reading frame (ORE), which coded a 375 amino acids-deduced polypeptide whose molecular weight was 40.27 kDa computationally. Protein conserved domain search and structural computation found that DbGAPDH consists of two structural conserved domains highly homologous in most species; multiple sequence alignment discovered two positive charge residues (Lys164 and Arg 233), which play a critical role in the protein-protein interaction between GAPDH, phosphoribulokinase (PRK), and CP12. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that DbGAPDH has a closer relationship with analogues from algae and higher plants than with those from other species. In silico analysis of the promoter region revealed six potential regulatory elements might be involved in four hypothesized functions characterized by chloroplast GAPDH: oxygen-, light-, pathogen-, and cold-induced regulation. These results might supply some hints for the functional diversity mechanisms of DbGAPDH, and fresh information for further research to bridge the gap between our knowledge of DNA and protein structure and our understanding of functional biology in GAPDH regulation.									2	4	0	0	2	0	6			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000308574900055	22906227

Measurements of patterns of the oxygen yield induced by a train of single-turnover flashes and evaluation of the data within the framework of an extended Kok model [Messinger, J., Wacker, U., and Renger, G. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 7852-7862] led to the following results: (a) the rate constants k(s1)(NH(2)R) exhibit strikingly similar pH dependencies for NH2OH and NH2NH2 with ''titration waves'' at pH 5.3-5.6; 6.2-6.5, and above a critical pH value of about 7.4; (b) the differences in the reaction mechanism between NH2OH (1-electron reduction) and NH2NH2 (2-electron reduction) are almost pH-independent; (c) the ratio of the rate constants, k(s1)(NH2OH)/k(s1)(NH2NH2), decreases by a factor of about 9 within the range 5 < pH < 8.5. A detailed analysis reveals that these data cannot be consistently explained by the assumption that the unprotonated forms NH2OH and NH2NH2 are the active species while the protonated cations [NH3OH](+) and [N2H5](+) are nonreactive. A quantitative description is achieved by the additional postulate that pH-dependent structural changes take place in the WOC, thereby modulating the reactivity toward exogenous redox active amines of the type NH(2)R. On the basis of the results of this study and a recent report [Messinger, J., and Renger, G. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 10896-10905], it is inferred that the WOC undergoes three specific structural changes, with characteristic pH values of 5.3-5.5,6.2-6.5, and above 7.4.									16	0	0	0	14	0	16			0006-2960			WOS:A1995QX56700021	7742322	
J	Liu, Jing; Hodes, Gary; Yan, Junqing; Liu, Shengzhong (Frank)								Metal-doped Mo2C (metal = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) as catalysts on TiO2 for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in neutral solution								CHINESE JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				42	1	SI		205	216		10.1016/S1872-2067(20)63589-6				JAN 2021	2021	The neutral hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is vital in the chemical industry, and its efficiency depends on the interior character of the catalyst. Herein, work function (WF) engineering is introduced via 3d metal (Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) doping for modulating the Fermi energy level of Mo2C. The defective energy level facilitates the free water molecule adsorption and, subsequently, promotes the neutral HER efficiency. Specifically, at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), Cu-Mo2C exhibits the best HER performance with an overpotential of 78 mV, followed by Ni-Mo2C, Co-Mo2C, Fe-Mo2C, and bare Mo2C with 90, 95, 100, and 173 mV, respectively, and the corresponding Tafel slope values are 40, 43, 42, 56, and 102 mV/dec. The modified WF can also lead to an enhanced photocatalytic efficiency owing to the lowered Schottky barrier and excellent carrier transition across the electrocatalyst-solution interface. When coupling the metal-doped Mo2C samples with TiO2, enhanced photocatalytic neutral HER rates are obtained in comparison to the case with bare TiO2. Typically, the HER rates are 521, 404, 275, 224, 147, and 112 mu mol/h for Cu, Ni, Co, Fe, bare Mo2C, and bare TiO2, respectively. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (TRPS) and ultrafast transient absorption (TA) measurements are carried out to confirm the recombination and migration of the photogenerated carriers. The fitted t values from the TRPS curves are 22.6, 20.5, 10.1, 4.7, 4.0, 2.5, and 1.9 ns for TiO2, TiO2-Mo2C, TiO2-Fe-Mo2C, TiO2-Fe-Mo2C, TiO2-Fe-Mo2C, TiO2-Fe-Mo2C, and TiO2-Pt, respectively. Additionally, the fitted t values from the TA results are 31, 73, and 105 ps for the TiO2-Mo2C, TiO2-Cu-Mo2C, and TiO2-Pt samples, respectively. This work provides in-depth insights into the WF modulation of an electrocatalyst for improving the HER performance. (C) 2020, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

To protect our groundwater resources we need to understand the degradation processes under anaerobic conditions. Available iron and manganese oxides are used as electron acceptors for anaerobic degradation and are reduced to the dissolved form of metallic cations in pore water. To monitor this process is a challenge, because anaerobic conditions are difficult to sample directly without introducing oxygen. A few studies have shown an impact of iron reduction on spectral induced polarisation (SIP) signature, often associated with bacterial growth. Our objective is to study the impact of iron and manganese oxide dissolution, caused by degradation of an organic compound, with spectral induced polarisation signatures.Twenty-six vertical columns (30 cm high, inner diameter 4.6 cm) were filled with a sand rich in oxides (manganese and iron) with a static water table in the middle. In half of the columns, a 2 cm high contaminated layer was installed just above the water table. As the contaminant degrades, the initial oxygen is consumed and anaerobic conditions form Every three days over a period of one month, spectral induced polarisation (twenty frequencies between 5mHz and 10 kHz) data were collected on six columns: three contaminated replicates and three control replicates. Chemical analysis was done on twenty columns assigned for destructive water sampling, ten contaminated columns and ten control.The results show an increase of the real conductivity associated with the degradation processes, independent of frequency. Compared with the pore water electrical conductivity in the saturated zone, the real conductivity measurement revealed the formation of surface conductivity before iron was released in the pore water. In parallel, we also observed an evolution of the imaginary conductivity in both saturated and unsaturated zones at frequencies below 1 Hz. Overall, the anaerobic reduction of iron and manganese oxide during the organic degradation increased both the conductive and polarisation component of the complex conductivity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-7722	1873-6009		WOS:000460827500001	30600103

In this study, the electroactivity of the AC/Ni cathode was significantly improved by increasing the oxygen (16.9%) and nitrogen (124%) containing species on the AC using nitric acid oxidation. The acid-treated AC (t-AC) showed 21% enhanced wettability that consequently reduced the ohmic resistance (6.7%) and the charge transfer resistance (33.3%). As a result, t-AC/Ni achieved peak values of hydrogen production rate (0.35 +/- 0.02 L-H-2/L-d), energy yield (129 +/- 8%), and cathodic hydrogen recovery (93 +/- 6%) in MECs. The hydrogen production rate was 84% higher using t-AC/Ni cathode than the control, likely due to the enhanced wettability and a higher fraction of N on the t-AC. Also, the increases in polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder loadings (from 4.6 mg-PVDF/cm(2) to 7.3 mg-PVDF/cm(2)) demonstrated 47% higher hydrogen productions rates in MECs.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0960-8524	1873-2976		WOS:000783016000003	35217164

During oxidation, turbidity increases linearly with time till a maximum value, according to a formation rate that shows a dependence of second order with respect to the catalyst concentration. Next, the decrease in turbidity shows the evolution of second-order kinetics, where the kinetics constant is inversely proportional to the dosage of iron, of order 0.7. The concentration of iron species is analysed at the point of maximum turbidity, as a function of the total amount of iron. Then, it is found that using dosages Fe-T = 0-15.0 mg/L, the majority iron species was found to be ferrous ions, indicating that its concentration increases linearly with the dosage of total iron. This result may indicate that the photo-reaction of ferric ion occurs leading to the regeneration of ferrous ion. The results, obtained by operating with initial dosages Fe-T = 15.0 and 25.0 mg/L, suggest that ferrous ion concentration decreases while ferric ion concentration increases in a complementary manner. This fact could be explained as a regeneration cycle of the iron species. The observed turbidity is generated due to the iron being added as a catalyst and the organic matter present in the system. Later, it was found that at the point of maximum turbidity, the concentration of ferrous ions is inversely proportional to the concentration of phenol and its dihydroxylated intermediates.									9	0	0	0	4	0	9			0959-3330	1479-487X		WOS:000352319900014	25652956

In cyanobacteria and green algae, the corresponding reaction is catalyzed by glycolate dehydrogenases (GlcD). The genomes of N-2-fixing cyanobacteria, such as Nostoc PCC 7120 and green algae, appear to harbor genes for both GlcD and GOX proteins. The GOX-like proteins from Nostoc (No-LOX) and from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii showed high L-lactate oxidase (LOX) and low GOX activities, whereas glycolate was the preferred substrate of the phylogenetically related At-GOX2 from Arabidopsis thaliana. Changing the active site of No-LOX to that of At-GOX2 by site-specific mutagenesis reversed the LOX/GOX activity ratio of No-LOX. Despite its low GOX activity, No-LOX overexpression decreased the accumulation of toxic glycolate in a cyanobacterial photorespiratory mutant and restored its ability to grow in air. A LOX-deficient Nostoc mutant grew normally in nitrate-containing medium but died under N-2-fixing conditions. Cultivation under low oxygen rescued this lethal phenotype, indicating that N-2 fixation was more sensitive to O-2 in the Dlox Nostoc mutant than in the wild type. We propose that LOX primarily serves as an O-2-scavenging enzyme to protect nitrogenase in extant N-2-fixing cyanobacteria, whereas in plants it has evolved into GOX, responsible for glycolate oxidation during photorespiration.									36	0	0	0	35	1	39			1040-4651	1532-298X		WOS:000295254700016	21828292

We analysed Clostridium perfringens and sulphite-reducing clostridia (SRC) by cultivation, and streptomycetes by real-time PCR in five full-scale, temperature-monitored and aerated composting processes, and two pilot-scale drum composters. Facilities composted woodchips, sawdust, peat, or bark amended sludge or source-separated biowaste. Streptomycetes genes of 0.21-110 x 10(7) copies/g feed increased fast to 0.019-33 x 10(9) copies/g, and then were equal or decreased. SRC of 0.06-2.2 x 10(7) cfu/g feed decreased to 0-600 cfu/g, with re-growth in two facilities. End products were clean of C. perfringens, detected in sludge composts. Although processes contained large quantities of spore-forming bacteria, in the best facilities end products had the high quality. Temperature (> 55 degrees C, > 2d) was not related to the end compost quality, but relations between waste and bulking agent qualities, aeration, and processing time should be better controlled.

In this work, we report the rational design of a new kind of visible-light photocatalyst, hollow ZnCdS rhombic dodecahedral cages, fabricated via simple sulfurization and cation-exchange using zeolitic-imidazolate-framework-8 (ZIF-8) as the single precursor. The hollow cages and mesoporous structures can endow Zn1-xCdxS solid solutions with significantly improved visible-light utilization and charge carrier separation and transfer. In addition, the BET surface areas of hollow ZnCdS cages were also significantly enhanced with the introduction of Cd as compared to those of ZnS cages, benefitting the provision of abundant exposed active sites and decrease of the charge transport distance. Moreover, suitable band matching and strong electron coupling in these solid solutions could be simultaneously achieved via ion-exchange, featuring the balance between the light absorption ability and the potential of the conduction band of the Zn1-xCdxS photocatalysts. Consequently, the hollow Zn0.6Cd0.4S cage material exhibited the highest hydrogen production rate of 5.68 mmol h(-1) g(-1) under cocatalyst-free and visible-light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm) conditions. Furthermore, these hollow ZnCdS cages showed excellent long-term stability, maintaining high photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution over a number of cycles. We believe that this facile strategy for developing highly efficient ZnCdS photocatalysts from MOFs could be extended to the synthesis of other metal hollow cages for a variety of advanced applications.									142	7	0	0	11	0	143			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000416340300009

Both of them are able, under appropriate conditions, to convert polyphenols to quinones and induce cytotoxicity through the production of reactive oxygen species, a fundamental event in many immune responses. In ascidians, PO activity has been described and studied in both solitary and colonial species and the enzyme is involved in inflammatory and cytotoxic reactions against foreign cells or molecules, and in the formation of the cytotoxic foci which characterise the non-fusion reaction of botryllids. Expressed genes for two putative POs (CiPO1 and CiPO2) have been recently identified in C. intestinalis.In the present study, we determined the cDNA sequences of two haemocyanin-like proteins from two colonial ascidians: Botryllus schlosseri from the Mediterranean Sea and Polyandrocarpa misakiensis from Japan. Multiple sequence alignments evidenced the similarity between the above sequences and crustacean proPOs whereas the analysis of the three-dimensional structure reveals high similarity with arthropod haemocyanins which share common precursors with arthropod proPOs. Botryllus HLP grouped in the same cluster with Ciona POs, whereas Polyandrocarpa HLP clustered with arthropod haemocyanins; all of them share the full conservation of the six histidines at the two copper-binding sites as well as of other motifs, also found in arthropod haemocyanin subunits, involved in the regulation of enzyme activity. In situ hybridisation indicated that the genes are transcribed inside morula cells, a characteristic haemocyte type in ascidians where PO activity is located, at the beginning of their differentiation. These results represent a first attempt to identify candidate molecules responsible of the PO activity in compound ascidians. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A green strategy for the synthesis of ultrathin PCN nanosheets with integration of high-efficiency and enriched active edges using minimimal chemicals and energy input is overwhelmingly required and is still challenging. Herein, we report a green, cost-effective and template-free synthesis approach for ultrathin foam-like PCN nanosheets with enriched active sites in a wet atmosphere via a "three-in-one" strategy. This strategy relies on coupling of melem segments, polymerization with condensed layers, delamination by water molecules, and introduction of new terminal groups entirely in one-pot without any other additives. The obtained melem-derived PCN (MFCN-wet) shows highly loose and extremely light characteristics with the formation of ultrathin few-layers. Furthermore, it exhibits a high specific surface area and pore volume. Most importantly, the enriched active sites with fast charge carrier transfer drastically enhance the hydrogen evolution rate and rhodamine B (RhB) degradation with a high stability under visible light irradiation, compared with that of the as-synthesized materials in nitrogen and air atmospheres. This sustainable strategy could provide new opportunities for further environmental and energy applications.									13	0	0	0	1	0	12			2398-4902			WOS:000472980200012

Response surface methodology based central composite design was applied to understand the parametric effects of ultrasonic power, current density, initial pH, and electrolyte dose. Enhanced ofloxacin degradation was obtained using sonoelectrochemical (approximate to 95%) process in comparison to the electrochemical (approximate to 60.6%) and sonolysis alone (approximate to 7.2%) after 120 min treatment time. Multi-response optimization was used so as to maximize COD removal (70.12%) and minimize specific energy consumption (11.92 kWh (g COD removed)(-1))at the optimized parametric condition of pH = 6.3 (natural pH), ultrasonic power = 54 W, current density = 213 A m(-2), and Na2SO4 electrolyte dose = 2.0 g L-1. It was revealed that (OH)-O-center dot radicals contribute major to the ofloxacin degradation reaction among the other oxidizing agents. Degradation of the ofloxacin followed pseudo-first-order kinetics with a higher reaction rate, which confirmed the synergistic effect of 34% between ultrasound and electrochemical approaches. The degradation pathway of ofloxacin removal was elucidated at optimum condition by the temporal evolution of the intermediate compounds and final products using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS), high-resolution mass spectroscopy (HR-MS), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) coupled with energy dispersed X-ray (EDX) were used to determine the morphology of electrodes. Operational cost analysis was done based on the reactor employed in the present study. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The photocatalytic performance of the prepared rGO/InVO4-TiO2 nanocomposites was evaluated for H-2 evolution activity from water splitting with glycerol as a sacrificial agent. Interestingly, a synergistic effect (6-fold) was observed with rGO/InVO4-TiO2 nanocomposite prepared with the help of ultrasound compared to the samples prepared without ultrasound. The optimized nanocomposite (rGO/InVO4-TiO2) exhibited a maximum H-2 evolution of 1669 pmol h(-1), a similar to 13-fold enhancement compared to the bare TiO2. This remarkable enhancement is mainly due to the synergistic effect induced by ultrasonic irradiation along with the shifting of the optical band gap of TiO2 from 3.20 eV to 2.80 eV by loading of InVO4 and rGO and also strong chemical bonding between metal (Ti) and C through Ti-C bond formation, as identified by UV-vis DRS spectra and XPS spectra, respectively. Moreover, a significant quenching of PL emission intensity and smaller radius arc of the Nyquist plot in the EIS were observed when the rGO and InVO4 were loaded in TiO2, indicating the efficient charge carriers separation and transfer in the presence of rGO sheet, resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity. Thus, application of ultrasound has played significant and important roles in substantially enhancing hydrogen evolution along with rGO and InVO4 acting as support and co-catalyst, respectively.									33	0	0	0	9	0	33			1350-4177	1873-2828		WOS:000467508100001	30833197

Mass-specific metabolic rates of 173 animal species under various conditions of prolonged food deprivation (aestivation, hibernation, sit-and-wait existence) and/or living at temperatures near the freezing point of water were analysed.2. These minimum life-supporting metabolic rates are independent of body mass over a nearly 80-million-fold body mass range and independent of temperature over a range of -1.7 to 30 degrees C, with a mean value of 0.1 W kg(-1) and 95% CI from 0.02 to 0.67 W kg(-1).3. Additionally, 66 measurements of anoxic metabolic rates in 32 species capable of surviving at least 1 h of anoxia were analysed. While similarly mass-independent, anoxic metabolic rates are significantly more widely scattered (1200-fold 95% CI); they are on average one order of magnitude lower than during normoxia and depend on temperature with Q(10) = 2.8.4. Energy losses at the time of 50% mortality during anoxia are 30-300 times smaller than the energy losses tolerated by normoxic organisms in the various energy-saving regimes studied.5. These principal differences form the basis for proposing two alternative strategies by which organisms survive environmental stress: the regime of abandoned metabolic control ('slow death'), when, as in anoxic obligate aerobes, measured rates of energy dissipation can predominantly reflect chaotic processes of tissue degradation rather than meaningful biochemical reactions; and the regime of minimum metabolic control, when biochemical order is sustained at the expense of ordered metabolic reactions. Death or survival in the regime of abandoned metabolic control is dictated by the amount of accumulated biochemical damage and not by the available energy resources, as it is in the regime of minimum metabolic control.									33	1	1	0	30	0	35			0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000236175600011

In the case of parasitic groups, this helps us understand the adaptation to this lifestyle and a particular host. Most diplomonads are parasites, but there are free-living members of the group nested among the host-associated diplomonads. Furthermore, most of the close relatives within Fornicata are free-living organisms. This leaves the lifestyle of the ancestor unclear. Here, we present metabolic maps of four different diplomonad species. We identified 853 metabolic reactions and 147 pathways present in at least one of the analyzed diplomonads. Our study suggests that diplomonads represent a metabolically diverse group in which differences correlate with different environments (e.g., the detoxification of arsenic). Using a parsimonious analysis, we also provide a description of the putative metabolism of the last Diplomonadida common ancestor. Our results show that the acquisition and loss of reactions have shaped metabolism since this common ancestor. There is a net loss of reaction in all branches leading to parasitic diplomonads, suggesting an ongoing reduction in the metabolic capacity. Important traits present in host-associated diplomonads (e.g., virulence factors and the synthesis of UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine) are shared with freeliving relatives. The last Diplomonadida common ancestor most likely already had acquired important enzymes for the salvage of nucleotides and had a reduced capacity to synthesize nucleotides, lipids, and amino acids de novo, suggesting that it was an obligate host-associated organism.IMPORTANCE Diplomonads are a group of microbial eukaryotes found in oxygenpoor environments. There are both parasitic (e.g., Giardia intestinalis) and free-living (e.g., Trepomonas) members in the group. Diplomonads are well known for their anaerobic metabolism, which has been studied for many years. Here, we reconstructed whole metabolic networks of four extant diplomonad species as well as their ancestors, using a bioinformatics approach. We show that the metabolism within the group is under constant change throughout evolutionary time, in response to the environments that the different lineages explore. Both gene losses and gains are responsible for the adaptation processes. Interestingly, it appears that the last Diplomonadida common ancestor had a metabolism that is more similar to extant parasitic than free-living diplomonads. This suggests that the host-associated lifestyle of parasitic diplomonads, such as the human parasite G. intestinalis, is an old evolutionary adaptation.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2379-5077			WOS:000630974900014	33361320

However, the extent of the redox reaction in the EA reaction tube can greatly affect the accuracy and precision of measurements, especially in the case of complex geological samples. It is therefore necessary to determine the appropriate reaction conditions to reach a high recovery of nitrogen by complete combustion or thermal decomposition and quantitative reduction.METHODS: The conventional Dumas dual-inlet method was used to determine the bulk nitrogen isotope composition of SGR-1 (an organic-rich standard sample), which then was analyzed by EA/IRMS under different EA reaction conditions to study the influence of the redox environment on the delta N-15 measurements. The measured data together with the results reported by previous researchers were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the nitrogen extraction for organic-rich rock samples.RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that with the Dumas dual-inlet method more oxidizing agent (CuO) addition to SGR-1 would yield a higher nitrogen content of 0.91% than the recommended content (0.81%) although a delta N-15 value of 17.39 +/- 0.09% was consistent with the recommended value by USGS. Using EA/IRMS, when more O-2 was injected in the reaction tube, a high nitrogen content (0.92 +/- 0.01%) and a delta N-15 value (17.43 +/- 0.17%) close to that of the Dumas dual-inlet method were obtained. The addition of V2O5 or CuO in a continuous-flow system of EA/IRMS could not effectively enable the complete combustion of SGR-1.CONCLUSIONS: When measuring the nitrogen isotope composition of organic-rich rock sample dominated by reduced substances with EA/IRMS, greater O-2 injection will enable more complete combustion to obtain reliable nitrogen yields compared with the addition of V2O5 or CuO.

The cyano groups and nitrogen vacancies, as evidenced by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) and Solid-state C-13 MAS NMR spectra, are controllable via adjusting chemical reduction temperature. Comparing to the pristine g-C3N4, the as-prepared g-C3N4-x shows much enhanced photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity under visible-light irradiation. The maximum H-2 evolution rate of 3068 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1) is achieved with g-C3N4-x after chemical reduction treatment at 400 degrees C for 1 h, which is 4.85 times that of the pristine g-C3N4. Moreover, excellent reusability and storage stability have been shown by this photocatalyst as well. It is discovered that nitrogen defects can result in both the up-shift of the valance band and the down-shift of the conduction band, which benefit the absorption of longer wavelength photons and trapping of the photoinduced electrons, therefore reducing the recombination losses of the generated carriers. It is because of this improved visible-light absorption and charge carrier separation, g-C3N4-x displays better visible-light photocatalytic activity compared to the pristine g-C3N4. It is then concluded that the synthetic strategy presented here represents a straightforward and efficient way to synergistically optimize the chemical composition, optical response, and photocatalytic characteristics of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts.

The groundwater flow paths, water ages, and geochemical features are well known from previous studies, providing a framework for the groundwater chemical and isotopic data, which is supplemented with data for spring water, river water, hot spring water, seawater, detergents, and fertilizers within the basin. The sulfate isotope composition of groundwater samples varied widely from -2.9 parts per thousand to +33.4 parts per thousand for delta S-34(SO4) and +4.9 parts per thousand to +17.8 parts per thousand for delta O-18(SO4) and changed systematically along its flow direction from the mountains north to the coastal area. The groundwater samples were classified into three groups showing (1) relatively low and narrow delta S-34(SO4) ( +2.3 parts per thousand to +7.6 parts per thousand) with low and varied delta O-18(SO4) (+4.9 parts per thousand to +12.9 parts per thousand) compositions, (2) high and varied delta S-34(SO4) (+10.2 parts per thousand to +33.4 parts per thousand) with high delta O-18(SO4) (+12.4 parts per thousand to +17.3 parts per thousand) compositions, and (3)low delta S-34(SO4) (<+6.1 parts per thousand) with high delta O-18(SO4) (up to +17.8 parts per thousand) compositions. These three types of groundwater were observed in the terrestrial unconfined aquifer, the coastal unconfined and confined aquifers, and the terrestrial confined aquifer, respectively. A combination of field measurements, concentrations, and previously determined delta N-15(NO3) data, showed that the observed isotopic heterogeneity was mainly the result of contributions of pollutants from domestic sewage in the rural area, mixing of seawater sulfate that had experienced previous bacterial sulfate reduction in the coastal area, and isotopic fractionation during the formation of sulfate through bacterial disproportionation of elemental sulfur. Our results clearly support the hypothesis that human impacts are important factors in understanding the sulfur cycle in present-day subsurface environments. A general model of sulfate isotopic evolution along with groundwater flow has rarely been proposed, due to the complicated hydrogeological research setting that causes varied isotope ratios, although its understanding has recently received great attention. This pioneer study on a simple volcanic fan aquifer system with a well-understood groundwater flow mechanism provides a useful model for future studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In order to describe the strong alteration of HOR/HER rates on platinum group metals (PGM) in acidic and alkaline media, at least two prominent descriptors based on a Pt-H-ad binding energy model and a bifunctional model are frequently discussed in the literature. A clear discrimination of these both descriptors for PGM-based multi-metallic materials, yet, remains a critical challenge. To solve this dilemma, we have made use of the oxophilic and structural properties of cobalt atoms in Pt-based nano-materials to tune their catalytic HOR performance in alkaline media. More precisely, we have designed PtxCo1-x nanoparticles with various structural motifs. Remarkably, the surface rearrangement of PtxCo1-x nanoparticles along the uniform alloy, Pt-rich shell, and Co-segregated core-shell motifs is controlled by the electrochemical environment. To identify the elemental distribution of Co and Pt atoms, a new descriptor is presented in this work, the so-called Q(Hupd)/Q(Coz+) ratio. The coverage of OHad species can be controlled by the coverage of oxophilic Co surface atoms to investigate the bifunctional mechanism on the HOR kinetics in alkaline media. Thus, we are able to correlate the HOR exchange current densities with tuneable Co coverage on the particle surface to mimic e.g. the coverage of "Co(hydr)oxide clusters". On the other hand, the strain effect to modify the Pt-H-ad binding energy is solely investigated on a Pt-rich shell induced by a Co-rich particle core. Despite the separation of these critical model parameters, cobalt as an oxophilic component strongly bonds OHad species at the bimetallic particle surface and modifies the HOR kinetics. In contrast, the induced lattice strain in the Pt-enriched shell of dealloyed core-shell nanoparticles leads to an increase of the Pt surface area-based specific exchange current density j0(spec) by a factor of similar to 2 compared to pure Pt. Based on our results, we provide deeper insights into the kinetics and mechanism of the HOR on PtxCo1-x catalysts with different structural nanoparticle motifs in an alkaline environment.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000669489400001

Py pyrite grains contain micro- to nanoscale inclusions of pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, bornite, sphalerite, galena, arsenopyrite, cobalt-pentlandite, enargite, titanite, biotite, barite, and have delta S-34 values of -3.8 to +2.7 parts per thousand (average delta S-34 = 0.6 +/- 0.9 parts per thousand), which is inherited from a magmatic and hydrothermal fluid input during alteration of the oceanic crust. Py2 pyrite occurs as inclusions within the cores of garnet where it coexists with fine-grained inclusions of rutile, glaucophane and rarely with omphacite. Thus, these pyrite inclusions likely formed during prograde evolution. Py2 is too small to be analyzed by SIMS and thus no isotopic compositions could be determined. The Py3 pyrite grains contain eclogite-facies mineral inclusions, such as omphacite, glaucophane, epidote, rutile and lawsonite, and are inferred to have formed during the late prograde evolution close to or at peak eclogite-facies conditions. Py3 pyrite display positive delta(3)4S values ranging from +3.6 to +13.2 parts per thousand (average delta S-34 = +9.7 +/- 2.8 parts per thousand), suggesting the source of sulfur was either anhydrite incorporated during seafloor alteration or S-34-enriched sulfide from lower sections of the oceanic lithosphere. Py4 pyrite occurs as irregular patches, isolated euhedral to subhedral grains or as rims around Pyl or Py3 pyrites, associated with magnetite and ilmenite. Py4 grains have delta S-34 values of -24.7 to -3.9 parts per thousand (average delta S-34 = -5.0 +/- 2.1 parts per thousand), with the most likely source of sulfur being S-32-enriched pelagic sediments that in the Tianshan are interlayered with the metavolcanic lithologies and underwent amphibolite facies metamorphism during exhumation. This study provides insight into the sulfur cycle within subduction zones. We document that during subduction and exhumation fluids with distinct sulfur isotopic compositions driven by dehydration reactions in the downgoing slab cause metasomatism in the surrounding lithologies.

The ultramafic massif of Koycegiz, which is located in the ophiolitic belt of southwestern Turkey, is a major source of metallurgical chromitite ore. The massif comprises a base of tectonized harzburgite with minor dunite overlain by a magmatic sequence of wehrlite, pyroxenite, troctolite and gabbro. Only sparse refractory chromitites occur within the harzburgites; in contrast, the upper and middle sections of the peridotite sequence contain abundant metallurgical chromitites. The peridotites record abundant evidence of mantle metasomatism on various scales, as the Fo values of olivine in harzburgite are 90.1-95.4, whereas those in dunite are 90.1-91.8. The compositions of the melts passing through the peridotites changed gradually from arc tholeiite to boninite due to melt-rock reactions, thus producing more Cr-rich chromitites in the upper part of the body. Most of the chromitites have high Cr numbers (77-78), although systematic changes in the compositions of the olivine and chromian spinel occur from the harzburgites to the dunite envelopes to the chromitites, reflecting melt-rock reactions. The calculated logfO(2) (FMQ) values range from -2.77 to +1.03 in the chromitites, -2.73 to -0.01 in the harzburgites, and -1.65 to +0.45 in the dunites. All of the available evidence suggests that the Koycegiz ophiolite formed in a supra-subduction zone (SSZ) mantle wedge. These models indicate that the harzburgites represent the products of first-stage melting and low degrees of melt-rock interaction that occurred in a mid-ocean ridge (MOR) environment. In contrast, the chromitites and dunites represent the products of second-stage melting and related refertilization, which occurred in an SSZ environment.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			0930-0708	1438-1168		WOS:000444951500006

The objective of the study was to follow Medicago truncatula nodule activity after nitrate provision continuously and to identify molecular mechanisms, which down-regulate the activity of the nodules. Nodule H-2 evolution started to decline after about 4 h of nitrate application. At that point in time, a strong shift in nodule gene expression (RNA sequencing) had occurred (1,120 differentially expressed genes). The most pronounced effect was the down-regulation of 127 genes for nodule-specific cysteine-rich peptides. Various other nodulins were also strongly down-regulated, in particular all the genes for leghemoglobins. In addition, shifts in the expression of genes involved in cellular iron allocation and mitochondrial ATP synthesis were observed. Furthermore, the expression of numerous genes for the formation of proteins and glycoproteins with no obvious function in nodules (e. g. germins, patatin, and thaumatin) was strongly increased. This occurred in conjunction with an up-regulation of genes for proteinase inhibitors, in particular those containing the Kunitz domain. The additionally formed proteins might possibly be involved in reducing nodule oxygen permeability. Between 4 and 28 h of nitrate exposure, a further reduction in nodule activity occurred, and the number of differentially expressed genes almost tripled. In particular, there was a differential expression of genes connected with emerging senescence. It is concluded that nitrate exerts rapid and manifold effects on nitrogenase activity. A certain degree of nitrate tolerance might be achieved when the down-regulatory effect on late nodulins can be alleviated.									58	2	1	0	50	0	61			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000329447400031	24285852

It exhibits an excellent solar absorption and a record-breaking quantum yield (Phi = 46%) and a high photon-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency (eta = 34%,) for solar photocatalytic H-2 production, which are all higher than that of the black hydrogen-doped TiO2 (Phi = 35%, eta = 24%). The MCFs serve to improve the adsorption of F atoms onto the TiO2/MCF composite surface, which after the formation of oxygen vacancies by vacuum activation, facilitate the abundant substitution of these vacancies with F atoms. The decrease of recombination sites induced by high-concentration F doping and the synergistic effect between lattice Ti3+-F and surface Ti3+-F are responsible for the enhanced lifetime of electrons, the observed excellent absorption of solar light, and the photocatalytic production of H-2 for these catalysts. The as-prepared F-doped composite is an ideal solar light-driven photocatalyst with great potential for applications ranging from the remediation of environmental pollution to the harnessing of solar energy for H-2 production.									92	4	0	0	8	0	92			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000353301900007	25511009

The microstructure evolution is, however, challenging when several elements with different properties are used. This research aims to study the effect of Si addition on the microstructure formation of the dual-phase Ti alloys in the presence of solid solution-forming elements such as Fe and Cu, and a high oxygen concentration. Ti-4Fe-0.5O-3Cu (TFOC) alloys with different Si contents (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 wt%) were fabricated from the elemental powders using spark plasma sintering, followed by hot extrusion. The TFOC sintered alloys with 0.2 and 0.4% Si showed very similar microstructures in the lamellae alpha+beta dual-phase. The coarsening of alpha colonies and primary beta grains was remarkable when Si content increased to 0.6%. The obtained primary beta grains were, however, significantly smaller than those in previous studies. In contrast, the refined globular alpha grains (respective grain sizes = 2.6 and 2.2 mu m) embedded in the beta matrix were observed in the hot extruded TFOC-0.2Si and TFOC-0.4Si alloys due to dynamic globularization. Additionally, EBSD analysis clarified that the hot extruded alloys had the strong fiber textures of (10 (1) over bar0) and (101) for alpha and beta phases respectively, which were consistent with the XRD results. High-resolution TEM examination demonstrated that Ti2Cu and Ti3Cu intermetallics of a length of 100-400 nm could form preferentially at alpha/beta interfaces. The experimental results showed that 0.4 wt% Si added to TFOC alloys formed fine globular microstructures in the presence of hot plastic deformation.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1044-5803	1873-4189		WOS:000620427000003

Herein, an effective method based on grinding treatment followed by a nitridation process is proposed to realize this goal. In the synthesis, a solution containing H-4[SiO4(W3O9)(4)] (SiW12) and CNTs modified with polyethylenimine (PEI-CNTs) was ground to dryness. Small-sized WN NPs were anchored onto the CNTs with good dispersion after calcination under NH,. Under hydrothermal assembly conditions (absence of grinding), WN particles of larger size and with inferior dispersion were obtained, demonstrating the important role of the grinding process. The benefit of the small-sized WN has been demonstrated by using WN/CNTs as a support for Pt to catalyze the methanol electro-oxidation reaction. The mass activity of Pt-WN/CNTs-G-70 (where G denotes the grinding treatment, and 70 is the loading amount (%) of WN in the WN/CNTs) was evaluated as about 817 mA mg(-1) p(L)' better that those of commercial Pt/C (340 mA mg p(L)) and Pt/CNTs (162 mA mg(-1) (pt)). The Pt-WN/CNTs-G also displayed good CO tolerance. In contrast, Pt-WN/CNTs prepared without the grinding process displayed an activity of 344 mA mg(-1) (pt) verifying the key role of grinding treatment in the preparation of WN/CNTs with good co-catalytic effect.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000367186000044	26503799

The rapid urban developments in Barka cause depletion of groundwater quantity and deterioration of quality through excessive consumption and influx of pollutants from natural and anthropogenic activities. In this study, 111 groundwater samples were collected from 79 wells and analysed for pH, EC, DO, temperature, major ions, silica and nutrients. In Barka, water chemistry shows large variation in major ion concentrations and in electrical conductivity, and implies the influence of distinguished contamination sources and hydrogeochemical processes. The groundwater chemistry in Barka is principally regulated by saline sources, reverse ion exchange, anthropogenic pollutants and mineral dissolution/precipitation reactions. Due to ubiquitous pollutants and processes, groundwater samples were classified into two groups based on electrical conductivity. In group1, water chemistry is greatly influenced by mineral dissolution/precipitation process and lateral recharge from upstream region (Jabal Al-Akdar and Nakhal mountains). In group 2, the water chemistry is affected by saline water intrusion, sea spray, reverse ion exchange and anthropogenic pollutants. Besides, high nitrate concentrations, especially in group 2 samples, firm evidence for impact of anthropogenic activities on groundwater quality, and nitrate can be originated by the effluents recharge from surface contamination sources. Ionic ratios such as SO4/Cl, alkalinity/Cl and total cation/Cl indicate that effluents recharged from septic tank, waste dumping sites and irrigation return flow induce dissolution of carbonate minerals, and enhances solute load in groundwater. The chemical constituents originating from saline water sources, reverse ion exchange and mineral dissolution are successfully differentiated using ionic delta, the difference between the actual concentration of each constituent and its theoretical concentration for a freshwater-seawater mix calculated from the chloride concentration of the sample, and proved that this approach is a promising tool to identify and differentiate the geochemical processes in coastal region. Hence, both regular geochemical methods and ionic delta ensured that groundwater quality in Barka is impaired by natural and human activities.									32	1	0	0	19	1	34			1866-6280	1866-6299		WOS:000274181000014

The electrolytic decomposition of ammonia wasmuch affected by the change of pH of ammonia solution which was caused by the water split reactions. The water splitreaction occurred at pH of less than 8 in the anodic chamber with producing proton ions, and occurred at pH of morethan 1 in the cathodic chamber with producing hydroxyl ions. The pH of the anodic chamber using an anion exchangemembrane was sustained to be higher than that using a cation exchange membrane, which resulted in the higher decom-position of ammonia in the anodic chamber. By using the electrolytic characteristics of the divided cell, a continuouselectrolyzer with a self-pH adjustment function w the ammonia solution from a pH-adjustment tank was circulated through the cathodic chambers of the electrolyzer. It enhanced the pH of the ammoniasolution fed from the pH-adjustment tank into the anodic chambers of the electrolyzer, which caused a higher decom-position yield of ammonia. And then, based on the electrolyzer, a salt-free ammonia decomposition process was sug-gested. In that process, ammonia solution could be continuously decomposed into the environmentally-harmlessnitrogen gas up to 83. , when chloride ion was added into the ammonia solution.				본 논문에서는 암모니아의 전해 분해를 위한 분리막 반응기의 음극방 및 양극방에서 물의 전해에 따른 암모니아 용액의 pH 변화가 고찰되었으며, 단위 전해 셀이 적층된 다단 전해 반응기에서의 암모니아의 연속식 분해 특성이 평가되었다. 분리막을 가지는 반응기에서 암모니아 용액의 전해 반응 시, 양극에서는 pH가 8 이하에서부터 수소 이온이 생성되는 물 분해 반응이 일어나며, 음극에서는 pH가 11 이상에서부터 수산기 이온이 생성되는 물 분해 반응이 일어나암모니아 용액의 pH를 변화시켜 암모니아 전해 분해에 영향을 크게 미쳤으며, 음이온 교환막을 사용하는 경우가 양이온 교환막을 사용하는 경우보다 양극방에서 암모니아 분해에 유리한 알카리 분위기를 보다 효과적으로 유지할 수 있었다. 분리막 전해 반응기의 특성을 이용하여 자체 pH 조정 기능을 가지는 연속식 암모니아 전해 반응기가 새롭게 고안하였고, 여기서는 pH-조정조 탱크 용액을 두고 이의 용액 일부를 음극방으로 순환시킴으로써, 양극방으로 주입되는 pH-조정조의 용액의 pH를 높여 암모니아 분해율을 높일 수 있었다. 또한, 그러한 반응기를 이용한 salt-free 연속식 암모니아 전해 분해 공정이 제시되었으며, 이러한 공정에서는 염소 이온을 가지는 암모니아 용액의 80％까지 연속적으로 암모니아를 환경에 무해한 질소로 분해 시킬 수 있었다.					0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0304-128X			KJD:ART000966392

In this work, we report a conceptual strategy in a ternary material system to simultaneously enhance the charge separation and water oxidation efficiency of photoanodes by introducing reduced graphite oxide (rGO) and NiFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH) on TiO2 nanorod arrays (NAs). An experimental-computational combination study reveals that rGO with a high work function and superior electron mobility accepts photogenerated electrons from TiO2 and enables fast electron transportation; while NiFe-LDH acts as a cocatalyst which accelerates the surface water oxidation reaction. This synergistic effect in this ternary TiO2/rGO/NiFe-LDH photoanode gives rise to a largely enhanced photoconversion efficiency (0.58% at 0.13 V) and photocurrent density (1.74 mA cm(-2) at 0.6 V). It is worth mentioning that the photocurrent density of TiO2/rGO/NiFe-LDH, to the best of our knowledge, is superior to previously reported TiO2-based photoanodes in benign and neutral media. In addition, the method presented here can be extended to the preparation of other efficient photoanodes (WO3/rGO/NiFe-LDH and alpha-Fe2O3/rGO/NiFe-LDH) toward high level PEC performance.									346	18	0	0	30	0	351			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000384921700018

These reactions were mostly restricted to the bentoniteheater contact. However, other processes were detected. Fe oxidation of carbon-containing steel was dominated by oxic corrosion and hydrolysis possibly through a similar Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reaction, leading to the monitored generation of H-2, CO2 and both reduced (alkanes, alkenes) and oxidized non-volatile (carboxylic acids) hydrocarbons, which are in partial equilibrium with CO2/carbonate under oxidation states highly reduced. Therefore, temperature, water, oxygen (due to no gas-tight conditions), and other oxidizing agents regulated the redox state and activities of all species involved in the bentonite barrier, being sulfates reduced to H2S and pyrite, Fe-oxides (hematite/goethite) to magnetite and siderite, and Fe(III)-bearing smectite to saponite and chlorite. These mineral phases were detected as main corrosion products. The dissolved Fe2+ ions generated by reduction of Fe-oxides diffused away forming surrounding greenish halos in the bentonite. Because air was not excluded, most of the corrosion was oxic but locally reducing conditions were established.Significant Mg accumulation was observed at the heater contact, which is related with the highest salinity values of the porewater (Na-Mg-Ca-Cl water-type, 0.41M ionic strength), the presence of saponite (trioctahedral Mg-smectite), brucite and Fe-rich chlorite; and a modification in the dehydroxylation temperature of the dioctahedral smectite clay mineral particles, together with the precipitation of carbonates and an increase in Ca/Mg at interlayer sites, Na being depleted.The mechanism for the structural clay mineral alteration seems to be Fe(III) structural reduction, rather than the C-steel heater/liner corrosion. Because Fe2+ cations are more stable in trans octahedral sites, rearrangements in crystal lattice seem to have formed cis-trans interstratifications favouring the migration of Mg to octahedral sites and the segregation of Mg2+ trioctahedral domains. Thus, both a solid-state transformation, producing high-charge/low charge layers similar to vermiculite ones; as well as dissolution-precipitation transformation, with the crystallization of a trioctahedral Mg-smectite (saponite), brucite and chlorite in localized zones of the bentonite barrier, seem to be inferred, depending probably on f(O-2), temperature, the amount of structural Fe(II) and Mg concentration in the pore water.The observed clay mineral transformations induced changes in some of the physico-chemical properties of the bentonite, decreasing the total cation exchange capacity and BET surface area. However, these modifications were restricted to the bentonite at close contact with the heater. The rest of bentonite from the FEBEX in situ test maintained its performance as an engineered barrier.					7th International Conference on Clays in Natural and Engineered Barriers for Radioactive Waste7th International Conference on Clays in Natural and Engineered Barriers for Radioactive Waste	SEP 24-27, 2017SEP 24-27, 2017		Davos, SWITZERLANDDavos, SWITZERLAND	9	1	0	0	0	0	10			0883-2927			WOS:000450301100016

Exposed sections in this locality include picritic and olivine-phyric basalts, with both subaerial and subaqueous textures that initially had significant primary porosity in the form of gas vesicles, scorias, and interclast voids within hyaloclastites. Alteration of these low-silica, high-magnesium basalts; formed regionally-extensive, silica-deficient zeolite-facies mineral assemblages that dominantly consist of mixed-layer chlorite/smectite clays, thomsonite, natrolite, gonnardite, analcime and chabazite. In the study area, faulting and fracturing allowed petroleum migration from sediments into the overlying basalts. Migration of petroleum and the associated brine led to the pseudomorphic replacement of zeolite and clay mineral assemblages by carbonates (siderite, magnesite, dolomite and calcite) and quartz. Carbonates associated with petroleum migration are rich in Mg and Fe, reflecting the interaction of a CO2-rich fluid with a picritic basalt and associated Fe- and Mg-rich smectites. Only late stage carbonates are calcium-rich, the result of depletion of aqueous magnesium and iron following precipitation of magnesite-siderite solid solutions. Values of delta C-13(vPDB) and delta 18O(vSMOW) of carbonates at Marraat form two distinct groups: (1) paragenetically early dolomite veins and magnesite-siderite replacement of low-grade metamorphic minerals that have VOvSMOW between 12.6 and 20 parts per thousand and delta(13)Cv(PDB) in the approximate range of 0+/-5 parts per thousand, and (2) late stage calcite veins that are lighter in O-18 (delta O-18(vSMOW) between 6.4 and 8.7 parts per thousand) and have a restricted range of delta 13C(vPDB) that is near zero. Comparison with isotopic properties of carbonates from petroleum reservoirs worldwide and carbonates formed from meteoric water in basalts from the North Atlantic Igneous Province suggests that the first group of carbonates are formed by reaction of oil field brines with basalts, but the latter group formed by reactions involving meteoric waters.Reservoir properties and quality are a sensitive function of the sequence of hydrothermal and deformation events affecting this region. Regional metamorphism resulted in extensive occlusion of primary porosity by mafic phyllosilicates and zeolites. Subsequent brittle deformation resulted in the formation of fracture sets that served as migration pathways for hydrocarbons and carbonate-rich brines. Interaction of these brines with the zeolite facies metabasalts resulted in extensive alteration reactions that replaced metamorphic mineral assemblages with carbonate+quartz, and generated significant secondary porosity that hosted the altering fluids and live hydrocarbons. Mineral paragenesis at Marraat indicates that zeolite and clay stability is a sensitive function of the oxidation state of the system and that this is controlled by water-hydrocarbon-basalt interactions.

Herein, we report a monolayer of nickel-vanadium-layered double hydroxide that shows a current density of 27 mA cm(-2) (57 mA cm(-2) after ohmic-drop correction) at an overpotential of 350 mV for water oxidation. Such performance is comparable to those of the best-performing nickel-iron-layered double hydroxides for water oxidation in alkaline media. Mechanistic studies indicate that the nickel-vanadium-layered double hydroxides can provide high intrinsic catalytic activity, mainly due to enhanced conductivity, facile electron transfer and abundant active sites.

Aqueous room-temperature synthesis of Au-Rh, Au-Pt, Pt-Rh, and Pd-Rh alloy nanoparticles: fully tunable compositions within the miscibility gaps								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY				21	31			11599	11604		10.1039/c0jm03913f				2011	2011	Many binary late transition metal systems have large bulk miscibility gaps, and a variety of synthetic strategies have been developed to generate these non-equilibrium alloys as nanoparticles. While many of these methods strive to co-nucleate both elements by exploiting fast reduction kinetics or co-sequestration within a confined space, we show here that simple room-temperature borohydride co-reduction of appropriate aqueous metal salt solutions yields alloy nanoparticles in the bulk-immiscible Au-Rh, Au-Pt, Pt-Rh, and Pd-Rh systems. The compositions can be tuned across the entire Au(1-x)Rh(x), Au(1-x)Pt(x), Pt(1-x)Rh(x), and Pd(1-x)Rh(x) solid solutions by varying the ratio of metal salt reagents, and they form in the presence of a variety of molecular and polymeric surface stabilizers. Reaction pathway studies on the model Au-Rh system suggest that the alloy nanoparticles form via a "conversion chemistry'' mechanism: Au nanoparticle templates nucleate first, followed by diffusion of Rh to form homogeneous Au-Rh alloy nanoparticles. The alloy nanoparticles tend to be agglomerated, but this can be minimized by forming the nanoparticles directly on catalytically relevant high surface area carbon and biological supports, e.g. Vulcan carbon and wild-type M13 bacteriophage.									65	1	0	0	4	0	69			0959-9428			WOS:000293190200023

Synthetic modifications to the molecular catalysts are valuable but often show trade-offs between turnover frequency (TOF) and the effective overpotential required to initiate catalysis (eta(eff)). Herein, we derive a new approach for improving efficiencies-higher TOF at lower eta(eff)-by changing the concentrations and properties of the reactants and products, rather than by modifying the catalyst. The dependence of TOF on eta(eff) is shown to be quite different upon changing, for instance, the pK(a) of the acid HA versus the concentration or partial pressure of a reactant or product. Using the electrochemical reduction of dioxygen catalyzed by iron porphyrins in DMF as an example, decreasing [HA] 10-fold lowers eta(eff) by 59 mV and decreases the TOF by a factor of 10. Alternatively, a 10-fold decrease in K-a(HA) also lowers eta(eff) by 59 mV but only decreases the TOF by a factor of 2. This approach has been used to improve a catalytic TOF by 10(4) vs the previously reported scaling relationship developed via synthetic modifications to the catalyst. The analysis has the potential to predict improved efficiency and product selectivity of any molecular PCET catalyst, based on its mechanism and rate law.									71	0	0	0	10	0	71			0002-7863			WOS:000408074800016	28724290

However, the presence of chloride ions inhibits the performance and durability of the air cathode electrocatalysts. This study is the first research to report the effect of the built-in electric field on corrosion prevention via Cl- repulsion. Our DFT model successfully demonstrated the near-surface charge transfer at the interface of cobalt core and pyridinic-N graphene (Co (fcc)/N-Gr) strongly contributed to advanced catalytic activity and selectively Cl- repulsion in seawater electrolyte. Experimentally, the structure of a few layered N doped graphene encapsulated cobalt (Co 4 mmol-N/C) showed superior catalytic activity in both alkaline (delta E (E-j=10 E-1/2) = 0.774 V) and seawater (delta E = 1.167 V).

The Ru-SNC catalyst, with a Ru content of 2.59 wt%, only needs an extremely low overpotential of 14 mV to deliver the benchmark 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. Additionally, yielding a hydrogen generation rate that is 15.6 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C at an overpotential of 25 mV places Ru-SNC among the topmost active alkaline HER electrocatalysts. The high activity of Ru-SNC is uncovered by X-ray absorption fine structure spectra and theoretical calculations, revealing a modified surface charge distribution of Ru through Ru-N/S bonds that results in an optimized Ru-H* interaction and a greatly reduced energy barrier for water dissociation. This simple strategy provides new insights into the development of highly efficient alkaline HER catalysts and can be readily extended to the formation of other highly active metal-based electrocatalysts.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000680099000001

However, a general question is whether a single atom active site is the most optimal to deliver the highest catalytic activity and selectivity or not? By using ab initio studies, herein we report a systematic investigation of the active-site dependent activity/selectivity for CO2 electrochemical reduction over a few Fe atoms (Fe-n, n = 1-4) doped graphdiyne. We find that Fe dimer and Fe trimer exhibit the highest catalytic activity and selectivity with the remarkably low rate determining step of 0.29 and 0.35 eV toward CO2-to - CH4 and CO2-to - HCOOH conversion, outperforming many reported catalysts to date. Moreover, the catalytic activity and selectivity can be significantly tuned by controlling the number of Fe atoms. The modulation of performance is attributed to the broken linear scaling relationship on different active-site structures that can significantly tune affinities to the key intermediates such as *CO, *CHO, *OCHO and *OCHOH, thus leading to efficient CO2 reduction over catalyst size. Our work is the first report of catalyst size effects for precise number of atoms (Fe1-4) which may open a new avenue for nanocatalyst design for electrochemical reduction of CO2.									52	6	0	0	1	0	54			2212-9820	2212-9839		WOS:000519553000029

When sintered for 10 min at 1300 degrees C, nearly single-phase Ti2AlN ceramics with elongated (similar to 22 x 6 x 6 mu m) grains were obtained. After sintering for 10 min at 1200 degrees C and chemical etching, Ti2AlN nanowhiskers (150-200 nm dia., 1-5 mu m long) were exposed in pores coexisting with TiAl, TiN and Ti2AlN grains. FIB-TEM studies revealed single-crystal Ti2AlN nanowhiskers in a TiAl matrix with orientation relationship [11-20](H)//[-101](gamma), (0001)(H)//(111)(gamma), gamma = TiAl, H = Ti2AlN. The nanowhiskers are believed to form by diffusion of TiN into TiAl during SPS and to be exposed during the chemical etch. Microstructural development during high-temperature oxidation of dense Ti2AlN ceramics for I h at <1200 degrees C involves gradual formation on the surface of layered microstructures containing anatase, rutile and alpha-Al2O3. After 1 h at >1200 degrees C, more complex layered microstructures containing Al2TiO5, rutile, alpha-Al2O3 and continuous voids layers form. After heating to 1100 degrees C for I h and cooling to room temperature, planar defects are observed in surface TiO2 grains identified as stacking faults bounded by partial dislocations. After heating for I h at 1400 degrees C and cooling to room temperature, cracks propagate in TiO2 grains. It is believed that planar defects and cracks arise from stress generation in the oxide scale. Thermal stresses formed on cooling may arise from thermal expansion mismatch of phases (TiO2, Al2O3 and Al2TiO5) in the oxide scale, the high anisotropy of thermal expansion in Al2TiO5 and thermal expansion mismatch between the oxide scale and Ti2AlN substrate. Growth stresses formed during the isothermal oxidation treatment may arise from the volume changes associated with oxidation reactions of Ti2AlN. An oxidation mechanism for Ti2AlN ceramics is proposed, which involves initial reaction with atmospheric oxygen to form oxide phases, demixing of the mixed oxide phases, void formation due to the Kirkendall effect and gaseous NOx release. Oxidation of Ti2AlN <1200 degrees C with 1 h hold times is limited, while above this temperature the oxide scale grows rapidly, and Ti2AlN ceramics undergo heavy oxidation.

J	Park, Cheolmin; Chang, Jinho								Suppression of H-2 bubble formation on an electrified Pt electrode interface in an acidic "water-in-salt" electrolyte solution								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A											10.1039/d2ta06434k		SEP 2022			2022	Electrode-oxidation of H-2 in aqueous solutions is of great interest as a powerful and clean electrochemical fuel, but it suffers from bubble formation, which acts as an insulator that impedes the electrode rate of H-2 oxidation and blocks H+ flux to an electrode. In this article, we report that the formation of H-2 bubbles can be kinetically suppressed on an electrified Pt electrode in an acidic "water-in-salt" electrolyte solution (WiSE), which leads to the reversible voltammetric features associated with H+/H-2 redox reaction. Redox reversible voltammograms of H+/H-2 were observed in acidic 6 m LiTFSI and LiOTf solutions, while those in both LiCl and LiNO3 solutions were redox irreversible on the Pt electrode. The apparent rate constants of H-2 bubble formation were estimated in the four different types of 6 m electrolyte solutions, and the formation of bubbles was inhibited most severely in the LiTFSI medium. The suppression of H-2 bubble formation during the electrode-reduction of H+ in an acidic "water-in-6 m LiTFSI" electrolyte solution (WiSE(LiTFSI)) was macroscopically monitored, and it was also interrogated through electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) measurements. In acidic 6 m LiCl and LiNO3 solutions, the abrupt generation of bubbles and rapid arrivals at the saturated surface coverages by the bubbles were monitored during the electrode-reduction of H+, which were almost analogous to that observed in an acidic solution without concentrated lithium salts. In a 6 m LiOTf acidic solution, smaller bubbles form and more compactly cover an interface on Pt than those formed in LiCl and LiNO3 media. In an acidic solution with the same molal concentration of LiTFSI, the frequency in the EQCM was not increased within similar to 2 min, and even after this, it increased at a slow rate, which was reflective of suppressed H-2 bubble formation on a Pt electrode in WiSE(LiTFSI). The inhibition of H-2 bubble formation was not because of increased solubility of H-2 in bulk WiSE(LiTFSI) but because of an interfacial layer (IFL) that formed on the electrified Pt electrode. This observation was validated through a voltammetric investigation in solutions containing different types of 6 m electrolytes with saturated H-2. H-2 was distinctively electrode-oxidized in the 6 m WiSE(LiTFSI) only when the electrode potential was negatively biased during the injection of H-2 gas into the solution, indicating the crucial role of forming an electrode potential driven IFL for the stabilization of H-2 in its dissolved form in proximity to the Pt electrode. A possible model for H-2 stabilization in the IFL was suggested, and lastly, the electrochemically irreversible nature of H-2 electrode-oxidation on an Au electrode was confirmed in WiSE(LiTFSI), indicating its strong inner sphere characteristics.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000869014700001

Here, we used ab initio simulations based on density functional theory to investigate the initial formation process of hydroxo and oxo bridges between divalent transition metals [namely Co(ii), Mn(ii), and Ni(ii)] in aqueous solution, leading to the growth of extended structures. Our simplified yet realistic model, rooted in the computational hydrogen electrode approximation, has been able to provide estimates in agreement with experimental measurements of the positive potential U required for deposition of the active amorphous metal-(hydr)oxo catalyst, taking into account variations in the solution composition. Our results reveal that: (i) Co, Mn, and Ni exposed to a positive potential form dinuclear building blocks through different reaction pathways, indicating structural features consistent with those previously reported for extended systems; (ii) key steps in the formation of stable hydroxo and oxo bonds are preceded by structural rearrangements of M(ii)[H2O](6) complexes, which are stabilized by H-bond formation among the hydration shells upon the approach of two units. This arrangement yields suitable dinuclear precursors with one or two water molecules holding a bridging position between metals; (iii) anionic phosphate (for Co) and acetate (for Mn) ligands favor the formation of stable dinuclear structures, lowering the electrochemical potentials required to oxidize metals; (iv) in the case of manganese, acetate facilitates the formation of a Mn-(hydr)oxo dinuclear complex by lowering the required applied potential; this behavior parallels the initial stage in the formation of the Mn4Ca cluster, the active site of the photosynthetic water-oxidizing catalyst in living organisms.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000629000400013

In this study, enol-incorporated carbon nitride (ECN) catalysts were used for PMS activation to degrade organic pollutants under visible-light irradiation. Our experimental and theoretical results revealed that the incorporation of enol into the poly-heptazine-based carbon nitride framework effectively tuned the electronic structure. The obtained ECN showed promoted PMS activation capability, along with increased visible-light harvesting ability and improved photogenerated charge separation. As a result, an excellent performance with a bisphenol A removal rate of 100% within 20 min and a total organic carbon (TOC) removal rate of 86% in 30 min was achieved in the Vis-PMS/ECN process. This was because ECN functioned as an efficient photocatalyst as well as PMS activator, which enabled the PMS activation process to proceed smoothly for center dot SO4- production under visible-light irradiation. These findings could offer some guidelines for the development of efficient metal-free photocatalysts in the persulfate-based advanced oxidation process for environmental remediation.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000802138300002

Based on the electrochemical analysis, the prepared Ti/IrO2 electrode was found to have powerful oxidation effect on the organics in the TNT red water, where the nitro compound was oxidized through an irreversible electrochemical process at 0.6 V vs. SCE. According to the analysis of the nitro compound content, the UV-vis spectra, and the FTIR spectra of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) red water with electrolytic periods, the degradation mechanism of the dinitrotoluene sulfonate (DNTS) was developed. And the intermediates were characterized by UPLC-HRMS. The DNTS mainly occurred one electron transfer reaction on the Ti/IrO2 electrode. At the early stage of the electrolysis, the polymerization of DNTS was mainly dominated. The generated polymer did not form a polymer film on the electrode surface, but instead it promoted a further reduction. After electrolyzing for 30 h, all NO2 function group in the TNT red water was degraded completely. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Magnetic susceptibility measurements confirmed a high-spin Mn(II) (S = 5/2) center in 1. The X-band EPR spectrum of 1 in dimethylformamide solution exhibits widely distributed transitions in the spectral range from 0 to 700 mT with particularly well-resolved hyperfine lines due to the Mn-55 (I = 5/2) nucleus. The abundance of highly resolved transition lines in the spectrum facilitated the electron paramagnetic resonance spectral simulation which revealed large zero-field splitting and g-anisotropies. When dissolved, 1 exists in equilibrium with a hexa-coordinated species, the latter probably resulting from disassociation of one chlorido-ligand allowing ligation of two solvent molecules. The redox behavior of 1 was studied and was compared to that of a structural analog for which water oxidation in the presence of a chemical oxidant has been shown. The results from water oxidation trials of 1 are discussed.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0937-9347	1613-7507		WOS:000271068300002

GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				121				120	138		10.1016/j.gca.2013.06.036				NOV 15 2013	2013	To explore the linkage between mass-independent sulfur isotope fractionation (MIF-S) and delta C-13(org) excursions during the Neoarchean, as well as the contemporary redox state and biogeochemical cycling of carbon and sulfur, we report the results of a detailed carbon and multiple sulfur (delta S-34, delta S-33, delta S-36) isotopic study of the similar to 2.7 Ga Manjeri and similar to 2.65 Ga Cheshire formations of the Ngezi Group (Belingwe Greenstone Belt, Zimbabwe). Multiple sulfur isotope data show non-zero Delta S-33 and Delta S-36 values for sediments older than 2.4 Ga (i.e. prior to the Great Oxidation Event, GOE), indicating MIF-S thought to be associated with low atmospheric oxygen concentration. However, in several 2.7-2.5 Ga Neoarchean localities, small-scale variations in MIF-S signal (magnitude) seem to correlate with negative excursion in delta C-13(org), possibly reflecting a global connection between the relative reaction rate of different MIF-S source reaction and sulfur exit channels and the biogenic flux of methane into the atmosphere during periods of localized, microbiologically mediated, shallow surface-water oxygenation.The Manjeri Formation black shales studied here display a wide range of delta C-13(org) between -35.4 parts per thousand and -16.2 parts per thousand (average of -30.3 perpendicular to 6.0 parts per thousand, 1 sigma), while the Cheshire Formation shales have delta C-13(org) between -47.7 parts per thousand and -35.1 parts per thousand (average -41.3 perpendicular to 3 parts per thousand, 1 sigma). The delta S-34 values of sedimentary sulfides from Manjeri Formation vary between -15.15 parts per thousand and + 2.37 parts per thousand (average -1.71 +/- 4.76 parts per thousand, 1 sigma), showing very small and mostly negative Delta S-33 values varying from -0.58 parts per thousand to 0.87 parts per thousand (average 0.02 +/- 0.43 parts per thousand, 1 sigma). Cheshire Formation black shale sulfide samples measured in this study have delta S-34 values ranging from -2.11 parts per thousand to 2.39 parts per thousand (average 0.25 perpendicular to 1.08 parts per thousand, 1 sigma) and near zero and solely positive Delta S-33 anomalies between 0.14 parts per thousand and 1.17 parts per thousand (average 0.56 +/- 0.29 parts per thousand, 1 sigma). Moreover, Delta S-36/Delta S-33 in the two formations are comparable with a slope of -1.38 (Manjeri Formation) and -1.67 (Cheshire Formation), respectively. This differs from the Archean reference line (i.e. -0.9).The sulfur and carbon isotopic signatures recorded here likely reflect different environmental conditions and/or ecosystems within the sampled Cheshire and Manjeri formations paleofacies. The differences in carbon isotopes in different sedimentological facies are interpreted as recording different metabolic pathways, including photosynthesis, methanogenesis and methanotrophy. Low delta C-13(org) values in the Cheshire Formation black shales suggest a strong influence of methanotrophy (likely preceded by bacterial methanogenesis), while the large range of Manjeri Formation delta S-34 may record bacterial sulfate reduction. The C and multiple S isotopic variations recorded here may imply different patterns of C and S fractionation, perhaps dependent on variations in the biogenic egress of methane to the atmosphere.

In this study, Pd nanoparticles made by 1.5 wt% Pd loading on Y-zeolite under pre-treatment was employed to investigate their electrochemical activities using cyclic voltammetry (CV), and detailed local structural characterization of Pd cluster was probed by the extended X-ray absorption fine structure. Pd nanoparticle sizes were predicted at 0.81 nm-1.2 nm and the CV measurement has demonstrated that Pd zeolite catalyst has exhibited a similar tendency to those 40% Pd on XC-72R carbon. The hydrogen spillover process and surface conductance pathways contribute to the electrochemical behavior on Pd surface. In electrochemical environment, hydrogen is able to form hydride phase on Pd surface by either direct hydrogen adsorption or migrating to the centre of Pd. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

While the latter has been analyzed extensively for different carbon precursors and heating rates, the former - being more complex even though it can occur at constant temperature - has not received sufficient attention. Here we use computational quantum chemistry to define more precisely and quantify the phenomenon of nascent site deactivation (NSD). The NSD process, which determines the fate of so-called "dangling bonds" in graphene, takes place within a relatively short time (e.g., seconds) and is a consequence of radical stabilization during formation or reactions of sp(2)-hybridized carbon materials, both flat and curved. Stabilization of reactive zigzag sites results in the formation of carbene-like edges. Free armchair sites can also rehybridize, to form carbyne-like edges. Adjacent zigzag edges can reconstruct to form pentagon-heptagon pairs that preserve planarity but convert the reactive sites from zigzag to armchair. We report the thermodynamic driving forces for these fundamental processes by determining the optimized geometries of ground states, as well as charge and spin density distributions, in prototypical graphene molecules.

The use of sustainable carbonaceous materials as an alternative to precious metals in electrocatalysis is a promising pathway for transforming sustainable biomass resources into sustainable energyconversion systems. The development of rational syntheses of metal-free carbonaceous catalysts derived from sustainable biomass has therefore become a topic of significant interest in materials chemistry. However, great efforts are still required to develop methods that are low cost, scalable, and environmentally friendly and which afford carbonaceous materials having an electrocatalytic performance comparable to, or even better than, existing precious metal catalysts. Herein, recent achievements in developing metalfree carbonaceous catalysts based on biomass are reviewed and discussed and the critical issues which still need to be addressed are highlighted. The focus is on representative synthesis and optimization strategies applicable to different kinds of biomass, as well as studies of the physicochemical structure and electrochemical performance of the resulting metal-free carbonaceous catalysts. Finally, some guidelines for the future development of this important area are provided.									71	4	0	0	2	0	71			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000463970200019	30589116

The results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) imply that the RGO-NiS2 dual co-catalyst is introduced into the aerogel system successfully. The photocatalytic activity of the RGO-NiS2 synergistic modified g-C3N4 aerogel remarkably exhibits an enhancement of 67 times than that of simplicial g-C3N4. Further, the photocatalytic process and the mechanism of the photocatalytic hydrogen production enhancement are studied, which is ascribed to RGO-NiS2 dual co-catalyst synergistic modification, including the Pt-like behavior of the NiS2 and the high conductivity and large specific surface area of the RGO.

Hence, a series of Mo-doped Co9S8 nanorod array on Ni foam (Mo-Co9S8/NF) was successfully synthesized through hydrotherma and sulfuration processes for the first time and used as an efficient and stable difunctional electrocatalyst for the overall water splitting. Such Mo-Co9S8-3//Mo-Co9S8-2 electrodes couple display superior water splitting performance with the requirement of a cell voltage of 1.50 V to drive a catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is lower than that of RuO2//Pt/C (1.52 V). The activity of the catalyst is greatly enhanced by the molybdenum ion doping and the instability of the sulfide is resolved. The experiment result shows that the relationship between the current density and pH is different in neutral and alkaline media, which is most be likely assigned to the change of O-O formation by transforming the reactants from water molecule to the hydroxy ion.

During cyclic voltammetry and after sudden potential jumps between noncatalytic and catalytic potentials, Ni oxidation/reduction was tracked with millisecond time resolution by a UV/Vis reflectance signal. Optimal catalysis at intermediate Ni/Fe ratios is explained by two opposing trends for increasing Fe content: a)pronounced slowdown of the Ni2+/Ni3+ oxidation step and b)increased reactivity of the most oxidized catalyst state detectable at catalytic potentials. This state may involve an equilibrium between Ni4+ ions and Ni2+ ions with neighboring ligand holes, possibly in the form of bound peroxides.									22	0	0	0	5	0	23			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000471314900020	30694602

More efficient anode catalysts are needed, however, to improve the sluggish hydrogen oxidation reaction in alkaline electrolytes. We report that BCC-phased PdCu alloy nano particles, synthesized via a wet-chemistry method with a critical thermal treatment, exhibit up to 20-fold HOR improvement in both mass and specific activities, compared with the FCC-phased PdCu counterparts. HOR activity of the BCC-phased PdCu is 4 times or 2 times that of Pd/C or Pt/C, respectively, in the same alkaline electrolyte. In situ HE-XRD measurements reveal that the transformation of PdCu crystalline structure favors, at low annealing temperature (<300 degrees C), the formation of FCC structure. At higher annealing temperatures (300-500 degrees C), a BCC structure dominates the PdCu NPs. Density functional theory (DFT) computations unravel a similar H binding strength and a much stronger OH binding of the PdCu BCC surface (cf. FCC surface), both of which are simultaneously close to those of Pt surfaces. The synergistic optimization of both H and OH binding strengths is responsible for the enhancement of HOR activity on BCC-phased PdCu, which could serve as an efficient anode catalyst for anion-exchange membrane fuel cells. This work might open a new route to develop efficient HOR catalysts from the perspective of crystalline structure transformation.									91	5	0	0	8	0	92			0002-7863			WOS:000452693800030	30396270

Thus, a rational design of the size, geometry and the pore structure of SnO2-based nanomaterials is still a dire demand. To this end, herein we report an effective approach for engineering hollow-structured SnO2 nanospheres with adequate surface oxygen vacancies simultaneously wrapped by a nitrogen-doped graphene network (SnO2-x/N-rGO) through an electrostatic adsorption-induced self-assembly together with a thermal reduction process. The close electrostatic attraction achieved a tight and uniform combination of positively charged SnO2 nanospheres with negatively charged graphene oxide (GO), which can alleviate the aggregation and volume expansion of the entrapped SnO2 nanospheres. Subsequent thermal treatment not only ensures a significant reduction of the GO sheets accompanying nitrogen-doping, but also induces the generation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the SnO2 hollow nanospheres, together building up a long-range and bicontinuous transfer channel for rapid electron and ion transport. Because of these structural merits, the as-built SnO2-x/N-rGO composite used as the anode material exhibits excellent robust cycling stability (approximate to 912 mA h g(-1) after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g(-1) and 652 mA h g(-1) after 200 cycles at 1 A g(-1)) and superior rate capability (309 mA h g(-1) at 10 A g(-1)). This facile fabrication strategy may pave the way for the construction of high performance SnO2-based anode materials for potential application in advanced lithium-ion batteries.									105	5	0	0	2	0	105			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000436133400026	29888359

Antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) has recently received much attention due to its favorable optoelectronic properties, low cost and unique nanorod structure. Herein, we constructed coral-like Sb2Se3/SnS2 heterojunction by introducing SnS2 with a nanosheet structure, which contributes to enhanced light absorption and provides more reaction sites. On this basis, synergistic optimization is carried out by the bilayer Sb2Se3 structure and ferrihydrite (Fh) to effectively inhibit charge recombination at the interface and facilitate electron transport. Compared to monolayer Sb2Se3 (1.54%), the IPCE value of bilayer Sb2Se3/SnS2/Fh can reach 20.56% (735 nm). The prepared bilayer Sb2Se3/SnS2/Fh has a maximum photocurrent density of approximately - 1.0 mA cm(-2) at 0 V-RHE, continuous testing for 1 h compared to monolayer Sb2Se3 still maintains more than 4 times improvement. This work provides a basis for the development of high efficiency and low cost Sb2Se3-based optoelectronic devices. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The nanocomposites were sonochemically synthesized in pure water by utilizing MnO(2)nanoparticles and AC nanoflakes that had been prepared through green routes using the extracts of Brassica oleracea and Azadirachta indica, respectively. MnO2-AC nanocomposites were confirmed to exist in the form of nanopebbles with a high specific surface area of similar to 109 m(2)/g. When using the MnO2-AC nanocomposites as a photocatalyst for the wastewater treatment, they exhibited highly efficient hydrogen production activity. Namely, the high hydrogen production rate (395 mL/h) was achieved when splitting the synthetic sulphide effluent (S2-= 0.2 M) via the photocatalytic reaction by using MnO2-AC. The results stand for the excellent energy-conversion capability of the MnO2-AC nanocomposites, particularly, for photocatalytic splitting of hydrogen from sulphide wastewater.									14	0	0	0	4	0	14				2079-4991		WOS:000564700900001	32824542	
J	LONKER, SW; FRANZSON, H; KRISTMANNSDOTTIR, H								MINERAL-FLUID INTERACTIONS IN THE REYKJANES AND SVARTSENGI GEOTHERMAL SYSTEMS, ICELAND								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE				293	7			605	670		10.2475/ajs.293.7.605				SUM 1993	1993	Physical observations on features such as temperature, pressure, and formation permeability are integrated with alteration intensity, fluid and secondary mineral compositions, and textures to show the most important thermal, chemical, hydrodynamic, and kinetics factors that control the evolution of two Icelandic geothermal systems, the Reykjanes and Svartsengi systems. There is an increase in alteration intensity and the abundance of fracture and vesicle fillings, a decrease in the abundance of primary minerals, and more extensive compositional heterogeneity near many aquifers, which are defined by circulation losses and temperature and pressure profiles. Features such as resorption and overgrowth textures, absence of systematic element partitioning, metastability, and undersaturation/supersaturation are widespread and are indicative of mineral-mineral and mineral-fluid disequilibrium. The composition of chlorite, however, is more sensitive to changes in the physico-chemical conditions of the fluid compared to other secondary minerals probably due to larger values of (4D(h)k(phi)/v2), linear kinetic rate laws, or both, where D(h) is the coefficient of hydrodynamic dispersion, k(phi) is the reaction rate constant, and v is the fluid velocity. Chlorite grains in more permeable formations in one Reykjanes well show larger Fe2+/(Fe2+ + Mg) ratios and lower Si-contents compared to chlorite grains in less permeable formations. Chlorite geothermometry is used to map out the temperature patterns and extract information on permeability variations. Temperatures and fluid compositions derived from chlorite compositions indicate hotter, more reduced, lower pH fluids in the more permeable formations in the Reykjanes well. The correlation of temperatures derived from chlorite compositions with formation permeability in the Reykjanes well is indicative of more anisotropic permeability compared to the Svartsengi wells. Computer models and experimental studies show that overgrowths of chlorite on resorbed calcite, epidote, and quartz and the occurrence of chalcopyrite and Mg- and Si-rich chlorite in many Reykjanes samples are produced by seawater incursion, mixing of seawater and the acidic thermal brine, and seawater-basalt reaction. At lower seawater-rock ratios, the systems are restored to calcite (Svartsengi) epidote, quartz, and Fe2+-Mg chlorite saturation. In many chlorite-filled vesicles, chlorite grains show a systematic rim-to-core increase in temperatures derived from chlorite compositions and grain size and a decrease in smectite content due to heating of cooler waters or late pulses of hot, reduced fluids. Oscillatory mineral deposition in vesicles probably formed by nonequilibrium processes involving diffusion and mineral precipitation. No systematic changes in epidote, garnet, and titanite compositions with formation permeability, temperature, or fluid composition were observed. Oxygen isotope and fluid inclusion studies indicate that some anhydrite, calcite, and quartz grains grew at an earlier stage when both systems were hotter and meteoric, possibly glacial-melt water. Both systems are cooling due to heat source decay, cooler water incursions, or both. The results of this study will be useful in testing experimental studies and computer models of seawater-basalt reaction and recognizing the thermal, chemical, kinetics, and hydrodynamic factors that control secondary alteration in submarine hydrothermal systems.									51	0	0	0	1	0	52			0002-9599			WOS:A1993LQ12100001

The activity of the nanohybrid towards the simultaneous detection of hydrazine (HY) and hydroxylamine (HA) was evaluated in phosphate-buffered saline solution (pH 7.0). Differential pulse voltammetry was used for the measurements, with a pulse amplitude of 50 mV and a scan rate of 0.04 V s(-1). Using the modified electrode, the oxidation peak potentials for HY and HA can be easily distinguished, with a large peak separation of 0.36 V. Very low LOD values of 2.1 mu M and 1.6 mu M were found for HY and HA, respectively. The selectivity of the electrode and its stability were also studied The tolerance limits in the presence of different interfering compounds were evaluated. After five weeks, a deviation from the expected results of similar to 2% was observed for both HA and HY determinations.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000493896900008

Specifically, 2D materials with ultra-thin thickness usually possess more vacancy-type defects and exposed edges than bulk materials, resulting in different electronic characteristics relative to those of bulk materials and leading to changes in the reactant absorption energy on catalysts. Introducing heteroatom dopants can further alter the charge distribution in 2D materials, thereby facilitating the formation of new defects and catalytic active-sites to improve the electrocatalytic performance. This review highlights recent defect chemistry advances and developments in 2D materials for electrocatalysis. We discuss various defects in 2D materials, such as edge defects, topological defects and vacancy defects so on, and the effects of defects on electrocatalytic performance. Defect engineering and rational design strategies for controlling defects on 2D materials will also be systematically discussed. Finally, various advanced characterization technologies to reveal different types of defects will be discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

As the dominating component affects the performance of Li-O-2 batteries, O-2-cathode catalyst with high efficiency, low price, facile preparation is important. Herein, polyhedral and porous Mn2O3 rods are fabricated for cathode catalysts in Li-O-2 batteries via electrospinning method followed by calcination. The Mn2O3 catalyst possesses a three-dimensional porous structure, which can offer good catalytic activity, expose plenty of active sites and improve the diffusion of electrolyte and O-2. When employed as the cathode catalyst, the Li-O-2 batteries show enhanced initial discharge capacity of 9701 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 200 mA g(-1), superior rate capacity and good cycling stability within 160 cycles at the capacity of 500 mA h g(-1).

Here, the structural, electronic and photocatalytic properties of graphene quantum dots (GQDs), pure and O, N, S-v-modified MoS2 monolayers, GQDs-based heterostructures have been studied by theoretical calculations based on density functional theory. Compared with the GQDs, the obvious red shifts of the absorption peaks can be observed, the absorption intensities increases evidently, and the typical type-II band alignments can be formed after the construction of the pure, O, N, S-v-MoS2/GQDs heterostructures, which is beneficial to promote photo-induced charge transfer and more visible light harvesting. Subsequently, it is worth mentioning that N-MoS2/GQDs heterostructure also has the lower binding energy and higher absorption in the infrared region and impactful photo-induced electron injection from GQDs to N-MoS2 surface. Therefore, this work provides an instrumental and promising approach in designing new GQDs-based heterostructures to enhance the solar energy absorption and conversion.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000456951700012

The chemical composition and morphologies of the as-prepared Co3O4 nanoparticles were extensively characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Varying the temperature caused considerable changes in the morphology, the electrochemical performance increased with rising temperature, and the redox reactions become more reversible. The results showed that the Co3O4 synthesized at a higher temperature (180 degrees C) demonstrated a high specific capacitance of 833 F/g. This is attributed to the optimal temperature and the controlled growth of nanocubes.									28	0	0	0	0	0	28			2079-4991			WOS:000416783800011	29088061	
J	Spaenig, A; Broekmann, P; Wandelt, K				Broekmann, Peter/D-1987-2013				Structure of electrochemically deposited sulfide layers on Cu(100)								ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PHYSIKALISCHE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY & CHEMICAL PHYSICS				217	5			459	477		10.1524/zpch.217.5.459.20454				2003	2003	In-situ EC-STM has been used to examine distinct phases of electrochemically deposited sulfide layers on Cu(100). The observed structures can be clearly assigned to specific ranges of the electrode potential and the sulfide concentration in solution. The scope of the present contribution is to report the various structural phases and their potential dependence. A full description of their concentration dependence will be given in a forthcoming paper.All incipient adsorption processes have been performed exclusively at negative electrode potentials close to the on-set of the hydrogen evolution reaction in order to avoid heavy surface reactions of the copper substrate with sulfide as seen at positive electrode potentials. In a very early stage of the sulfidation first A metastable, transient p(2 x 2)-S layer with a nominal coverage of Theta = 0.25 ML is formed which gets irreversibly replaced by an energetically more stable c(6 x 2)-S phase with Theta = 0.33 ML. This process at constant potential is kinetically hindered and depends on the sulfide supply from the electrolyte of given concentration. All further phase transitions induced by a positive going potential sweep are influenced by the sulfide supply from the electrolyte phase as well. A low sulfide supply from a low concentration electrolyte during a positive going potential sweep provokes a uniaxial compression of the preexisting c(6 x 2)-S phase ending up with, a striped c(4 x 2)-S phase. Conversely a high sulfide supply from a high concentration. solution during a positive going potential sweep causes a massive reorganization of both the atomic structure and the surface morphology on a mesoscopic scale. This latter process involves a massive transport of copper material out of the topmost copper layer and is, hence, identified as an adsorbate induced reconstruction of the copper substrate. The symmetry of the resultant sulfide structure on-top of the reconstructed copper substrate is similar to a square c(2 x 2) arrangement but on a copper surface whose lattice constants are expanded by 9% with respect to the copper bulk structure. Hence, the atomic surface structure is denoted as a pseudo-c(2 x 2)-S reconstruction.									23	1	0	0	0	0	23			0942-9352			WOS:000182884100002

A nanomixture of (TiO2-SnO2-Al2O3) cooperating with Hydroxyapatite (HAp) nanorods was synthesized in this regard as a catalyst to degrade Rhodamine B (RhB) dye from aqueous medium. The physicochemical properties of the hydrothermally prepared Hydroxyapatite Nano Mixture (HNM) were revealed through XRD, FESEM, TEM, XPS, FTIR, BET-BHJ, UV-Vis, and Raman spectroscopy techniques. The synthesized material which was found to be nanorods of average crystallite size 12.53 nm and BET Specific Surface area 60.81 m(2) g(-1) proved to be very effective for the removal of RhB at various pH conditions (acid, basic, and neutral). Maximum removal of 97% was achieved within 30 min of UV irradiation using 5 ppm RhB in acidic medium while at a higher concentration (20 ppm), it takes just 90 min to achieve 98% degradation of RhB under the same reaction conditions. A further catalytic potential of the prepared nanomixture for hydrogen (H-2) evolution via water splitting was explored where 129.45 mu mol g(-1) of H-2 was evolved within 60 min. Our findings suggest that the prepared nanomixture could be used as an efficient catalyst for removing spent dyes used in industrial processes and also as a catalyst for hydrogen gas production.

These domains exhibit a surprisingly high specificity for the type of quinone that can be bound. On the basis of a comparison of the results obtained, the structure of the quinone head group seems to be more important than the large hydrophobic side chain and/or the general lipophilicity of the compound.									19	0	1	0	13	0	21			0006-2960			WOS:A1995TJ28900017	7495803

In this study, we isolated the catalase gene (CsCAT) from the striped stern borer, Chilo suppressalis, a serious pest of rice in Asia. Sequence analysis of the genomic DNA indicated that CsCAT contains a 1023 bp intron and a 1524 bp coding sequence. The predicted CsCAT protein contains 507 amino acids and includes the proximal active site (FXRERIPERWHAKGXGA) and heme-ligand sequence (RLFSYNDTX) that are conserved in catalase enzymes. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that CAT from Lepidopteran moths could be assigned to one well-supported cluster. qRT-PCR indicated that CsCAT was expressed in insect heads, epidermis, fat body, foregut, midgut, hindgut, Malpighian tubules, and hemocytes. Expression of CsCAT was highest in the fat body and hemocytes of diapausing larvae, which suggests a potential important role in insect physiology during diapause period. Expression of CsCAT (measured by qRT-PCR) and enzymatic activity of CsCAT were not significantly altered by temperature stress, which indicates that CsCAT may insensitive to temperature.

However, it is necessary to adequately describe the associated phenomena: product respiration and gas exchange through the package. In this work, a mathematical model was established to describe the evolution of the O-2 and CO2 concentrations in a MAP system, considering packages with perforations and of variable volume and validated for tomato. Respiration rates of the packed product were described using Michaelis-Menten kinetics while gas exchange through the packaging films and the perforations was described with Fick equations of diffusion. The influence of temperature in these kinetics was considered to follow Arrhenius' law. In order to validate the model proposed, an experiment was conducted packaging tomatoes in PP, PLA and LDPE perforated bags for 12 days at 13.5 degrees C. The prediction capacity of the model agrees with the experimental data, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) equal to 0.89-0.98 for O-2 concentrations and 0.83-0.97 for CO2 concentrations. The model was used to define the required package surface area or perforation diameter to achieve a specific O-2 concentration in the headspace. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wen, XG; Qiu, NW; Lu, QT; Lu, CM								Enhanced thermotolerance of photosystem II in salt-adapted plants of the halophyte Artemisia anethifolia								PLANTA				220	3			486	497		10.1007/s00425-004-1382-7				JAN 2005	2005	Thermotolerance of photosystem II (PSII) in leaves of salt-adapted Artemisia anethifolia L. plants (100-400 mM NaCl) was evaluated after exposure to heat stress (30-45degreesC) for 30 min. After exposure to 30degreesC, salt adaptation had no effects on the maximal efficiency of PSII photochemistry (F-v/F-m), the efficiency of excitation capture by open PSII centers (F-v'/F-m'), or the actual PSII efficiency (Phi(PSII)). After pretreatment at 40degreesC, there was a striking difference in the responses of F-v/F-m, F-v'/F-m' and Phi(PSII) to heat stress in non-salt-adapted and salt-adapted leaves. Leaves from salt-adapted plants maintained significantly higher values of F-v/F-m, F-v'/F-m' and Phi(PSII) than those from non-salt-adapted leaves. The differences in Fv/Fm, Fv'/Fm' and Phi(PSII) between non-salt-adapted and salt-adapted plants persisted for at least 12 h following heat stress. These results clearly show that thermotolerance of PSII was enhanced in salt-adapted plants. This enhanced thermotolerance was associated with an improvement in thermotolerance of the PSII reaction centers, the oxygen-evolving complexes and the light-harvesting complex. In addition, we observed that after exposure to 42.5degreesC for 30 min, non-salt-adapted plants showed a significant decrease in CO, assimilation rate while in salt-adapted plants CO2, assimilation rate was either maintained or even increased to some extent. Given that photosynthesis is considered to be the physiological process most sensitive to high-temperature damage and that PSII appears to be the most heat-sensitive part of the photosynthetic apparatus, enhanced thermotolerance of PSII may be of significance for A. anethifolia, a halophyte plant, which grows in the high-salinity regions in the north of China, where the air temperature in the summer is often as high as 45degreesC.									67	19	1	0	62	0	89			0032-0935	1432-2048		WOS:000226810700013	15580526

Ovac were stable when incorporated into m-BiVO4(001) and increased the adsorption energy of O-2. Ovac changed the V3d orbitals of m-BiVO4(001) by adding a new band gap level, causing the redundant electrons of V atoms to become carriers and promoting the separation efficiency of electrons and holes. To verify the first-principle calculations, m-BiVO4 with different Ovac levels was prepared via hydrothermal synthesis. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirmed the existence of the (001) crystal surface of m-BiVO4. In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy of m-BiVO4 confirmed the presence of Ovac and demonstrated that, as the Ovac level increased, the number of superoxide radicals (O2-center dot) and hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) produced increased. In addition, m-BiVO4 with a higher Ovac level possessed superior photocatalytic properties to and degraded rhodamine B (RhB) dye nearly 2-fold faster than m-BiVO4 with a lower Ovac level. Finally, the removal rate of RhB increased from 23 to 44%. All experimental results were in good agreement with the first-principle calculated results.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2296-2646			WOS:000601281500001	33363112

This S-1-state multiline signal, with an effective g value of 12 and at least 18 hyperfine Lines, has previously been detected only in PSII preparations from the cyanobacterium sp. Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 [Campbell, K. A., Peloquin, J. M., Pham, D. P., Debus, R. J., and Britt, R. D. (1998) J. Am. Chem. Sec. 120, 447-448]. It is absent in PSII spinach membrane and core preparations that either fully retain or completely lack the 33, 23, and 17 kDa extrinsic proteins. The S-1-state multiline signal detected in spinach PSII cores and membranes has the same effective g value and hyperfine spacing as the signal detected in Synechocystis PSII particles. This signal provides direct evidence for the influence of the extrinsic PSII proteins on the magnetic properties of the Mn cluster.									73	1	0	0	51	0	75			0006-2960			WOS:000073279200001	9548734

The migration of H atoms from one Al atom to another on the cluster's surface is of critical importance to the mechanism of the complete H-2 production process. We have applied a combination of Molecular Dynamics and Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus theory including tunneling effects to study the gas-phase evolution of HAl17(OH)((-)), which can be considered a model system. First, we have performed an extensive search for local minima and the connecting saddle points using a density functional theory method. It is found that in the water-splitting process Al-17((-))center dot(H2O)-> HAl17(OH)((-)), the H atom which bonds to the Al cluster losses rather quickly its excess energy, which is easily "absorbed" by the cluster because of its flexibility. This fact ultimately determines that long-range hydrogen migration is not a very fast process and that, probably, tunneling only plays a secondary role in the migration dynamics, at least for moderate energies. Reduction of the total energy results in the process being very much slowed down. The consequences on the possible mechanisms of H-2 generation from the interaction of Al clusters and water molecules are discussed.

In this paper, we show for the first time a single-step in situ technique to control the porosity of two-dimensional g-C3N4 sheets and exfoliate them by introducing ascorbic acid (AA) molecules. The AA simultaneously acts as the carbon (C) source and deposits amorphous C onto g-C3N4 sheets. Nanosized pores are also introduced into the g-C3N4 sheets, leading to a large number of active sites. The as-prepared C-doped porous g-C3N4 nanosheets demonstrate a high visible light-photocatalytic H-2 production activity of 793 mol g(-1) with the optimum structure, which is almost 25 times higher than the value obtained with bulk g-C3N4 (31 mol g(-1)). This exceptional photocatalytic performance arises from the C-doped conjugated system and porous nanosheets. The enhanced photocatalytic H-2 evolution was attributed to the effective separation and transport of charge carriers by the deposition of C onto the nanosheets and an increased number of active sites resulting from the nanopores created inside the g-C3N4 sheets. Moreover, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations confirm that the interaction between AA and melamine molecules at elevated temperatures results in the formation of C-doped porous and exfoliated g-C3N4 structures. Therefore, the present approach is very promising for application to the design of new and efficient photocatalysts for photocatalytic H-2 evolution under visible irradiation.									25	1	0	0	4	0	26			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000459893900007

Herein, we anchored single atomic Ru on Fe2+ ions doped NiFe layered double hydroxides, affording a strong electronic interaction between Ru and Fe2+, which lowered the oxidation state of Ru and meanwhile enhanced the Fe-O bond strength, thus resulting in significantly improved activity and stability of both the Ru sites and NiFe-LDH substrates. With 1.32 wt% Ru loading, the Ru/ NiFe2+Fe-LDH catalyst showed a low overpotential of 194 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and a small Tafel slope of 36 mV / dec, which outperformed most of the Ru and NiFe based alkaline OER catalysts reported so far. In addition, the catalyst did not show obvious performance decay and dissolution after 100 h stability test at 100 mA / cm(2), attributing to the strong electronic coupling between the single atomic Ru and the NiFe2+Fe-LDH, as evidenced by the X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density function theory calculation results that Fe2+ transferred 1.54 e -to Ru.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000807103000002

The SOD protein family is widely distributed in the plant kingdom and plays a significant role in plant growth and development. However, the comprehensive analysis of the SOD gene family has not been conducted in Cucurbitaceae. Subsequently, 43 SOD genes were identified from Cucurbitaceae species [Citrullus lanatus (watermelon), Cucurbita pepo (zucchini), Cucumis sativus (cucumber), Lagenaria siceraria (bottle gourd), Cucumis melo (melon)]. According to evolutionary analysis, SOD genes were divided into eight subfamilies (I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII). The gene structure analysis exhibited that the SOD gene family had comparatively preserved exon/intron assembly and motif as well. Phylogenetic and structural analysis revealed the functional divergence of Cucurbitaceae SOD gene family. Furthermore, microRNAs 6 miRNAs were predicted targeting 3 LsiSOD genes. Gene ontology annotation outcomes confirm the role of LsiSODs under different stress stimuli, cellular oxidant detoxification processes, metal ion binding activities, SOD activity, and different cellular components. Promoter regions of the SOD family revealed that most cis-elements were involved in plant development, stress response, and plant hormones. Evaluation of the gene expression showed that most SOD genes were expressed in different tissues (root, flower, fruit, stem, and leaf). Finally, the expression profiles of eight LsiSOD genes analyzed by qRT-PCR suggested that these genetic reserves responded to drought, saline, heat, and cold stress.

J	Salifu, Musah; Aiglsperger, Thomas; Morth, Carl-Magnus; Alakangas, Lena								Stable sulphur and oxygen isotopes as indicators of sulphide oxidation reaction pathways and historical environmental conditions in a Cu-W-F skarn tailings piles, south-central Sweden								APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY				110						104426	10.1016/j.apgeochem.2019.104426				NOV 2019	2019	Improved remediation strategies or predictive modelling of acid mine drainage (AMD) sites, require detailed understanding of the sulphide oxidation reaction pathways, as well as pollutant-source characterisation. In this study, ore minerals, solids and water-soluble fractions of an oxidising Cu-W-F skarn tailings in Yxsjoberg, Sweden, were chemically and isotopically (delta S-34 and delta O-18) characterised to reveal sulphate (SO42-) sources, sulphide oxidation reaction pathways and historical environmental conditions in the tailings. delta S-34 was additionally used to trace the weathering of danalite [(Fe,Mn,Zn)(4)Be-3(SiO4)(3)S], a rare and unstable sulphur-bearing silicate mineral containing high concentrations of beryllium (Be) and zinc (Zn). Eighteen subsamples from a drill core of the tailings were subjected to batch leaching tests to obtain water-soluble fractions, which reflected both existing porewaters and easily-soluble secondary minerals. The tailings were categorised into three geochemical zones: (i) oxidised zone (OZ), (ii) transition zone (TZ) and (iii) unoxidised zone (UZ), based on prevailing pH, elemental concentrations and colour. The upper OZ (UOZ) showed a sharp depletion of sulphur (S) and relatively higher delta O-18(SO4) values (3.0 to +0.1%) whereas the underlying lower OZ (LOZ) showed S accumulation and lower delta O-18(SO4) values (4.6 to 4.2%). The higher delta O-18(SO4) suggested the role of atmospheric oxygen, O-2 (as oxidant), contribution of evaporated rainwaters and/or evaporation in the upper zones of the tailings. The lower delta O-18(SO4) values were indicative of ferric iron (Fe3+) as oxidant and the possible incorporation of O-16 into SO42- during its formation, most probably from snow melt or depleted rainwater. The delta S-34(SO4) values in the OZ (+2.3 to +2.4%) suggested SO42- from pyrrhotite oxidation in the UOZ which has been subsequently mobilised to the LOZ. Low delta S-34 fractionation (+0.2 to +1.9%) between SO42- in the OZ and pyrrhotite, as well as the low delta O-18(SO4) values in the LOZ suggested the complete oxidation of pyrrhotite by Fe3+, signalling that previously, a low pH (<3) prevailed in the tailings. Mineralogical observations confirmed that pyrrhotite was completely oxidised in the UOZ, with the formation of hydrous ferric oxides (HFOs) coatings. The observed current high delta O-18(SO4) and pH (3.9-4.5) values in the UOZ were attributed to decreased oxidation rate and silicate buffering, limiting the availability of aqueous Fe3+ and subsequent formation of HFOs. The delta S-34(SO4) signatures of the water-soluble SO42- in the TZ and UUZ suggested the dissolution of gypsum which precipitated from a leachate from the weathering of danalite in the UOZ. In the middle UZ, the delta S-34(SO4) (0.8 to +0.6%) and delta O-18(SO4) (1.8 to 1.0%) signatures corresponded to SO42- from a mixture of pyrite, pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite oxidation by O-2 at the LOZ (i.e. oxidation front). Negative delta S-34 fractionation values (3.0 to 1.6%) between these minerals and the water-soluble SO42- were attributed to the potential formation of intermediate S species, due to the partial oxidation of the sulphides. Consequently, the S accumulation in the LOZ could be due to the likely formation of the intermediate S species and secondary pyrite identified in this zone. The lower UZ coincided with the groundwater table and registered consistent negative delta S-34(SO4) (2.6 to 1.8%) and delta O-18(SO4) (7.6 to 4.4%) values. These signatures were hypothesised to be controlled by SO42- from the mineralisation of organic S in peat underneath the tailings and/or H2S oxidation, with possible contribution from sulphide oxidation in the tailings. This study highlights the usefulness of delta S-34 and delta O-18 as tracers of geochemical processes and environmental conditions that have existed in the tailings.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0883-2927	1872-9134		WOS:000494711200001

Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as a typical two-dimensional (2D) metal-free photocatalysts for water splitting has attracted increasing interest due to its economic production and environmentally friend features. However, the high photocarriers recombination rate constraint its catalytic activity. Combining the single-or few-layered g-C3N4 nanosheets with other 2D functional materials to form efficient metal-free heterojunction photocatalysts is one of the effective strategies to improve the photocarriers separation. Herein, we introduce a simple and efficient method to scalable preparation few-layered g-C3N4 nanosheets using gas exfoliation of bulk g-C3N4 in liquid nitrogen. Then we introduce the g-C3N4 nanosheets into construct a 2D/2D heterojunction of g-C3N4/graphdiyne by pi-pi interaction, where graphdiyne (GDY) as a new 2D carbon allotrope, has excellent holes transfer nature. We find that the 2D/2D g-C3N4/GDY photocatalyst with 1% GDY is the optimum condition, with the highest H2 evolution rate of 454.28 mmol h(-1). The superior photocatalytic performance may be attributed to the excellent photocarriers separation in g-C3N4 under the built-in field, where GDY can rapid transport holes from g-C3N4 to the sacrificial agents.

The last meeting devoted purely to studies of novae was held in Madrid in 1989. At that time IUE spectra of novae were just beginning to be analyzed in detail, the FXOSAT x-ray results had just been published, and ROSAT had yet to be launched. Since that time, the IUE studies of novae in the LMC (known distance and small reddening) showed that all fast novae exceed the Eddington luminosity at maximum which was not predicted by numerical hydrodynamic simulations. A number of novae have now been observed in x-rays with ROSAT, BEPPOSAX, ASCA, CHANDRA, and XMM (plus others). The x-ray studies determined the turn off times for several classical novae, showed that at maximum x-ray light they resemble the Super Soft Sources, and found rapid variations in the x-ray light curves of two novae. There have been abundance analyses of V838 Her (oxygen poor, sulfur rich), LMC 1991, and other classical and recurrent novae. Infrared studies have resulted in a number of puzzling results such as the same nova producing both carbon (first) and silicate (later) dust at different times during its outburst. There have been advances in theoretical modeling and most studies now include large nuclear reaction networks combined with the hydrodynamic calculations. One perplexing problem produced by the simulations is that they predict that much less mass is ejected in the outburst than is observed, and the problem has worsened as the input physics has improved. Nevertheless we have made significant progress in the past 100 years and I will present some of the more important developments that have occurred over the past century. I will end with a list of questions to be answered.

J	Kuzek, D; Pace, RJ				Pace, Ronald J/T-5906-2017				Probing the Mn oxidation states in the OEC. Insights from spectroscopic, computational and kinetic data								BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-BIOENERGETICS				1503	1-2			123	137		10.1016/S0005-2728(00)00218-8				JAN 5 2001	2001	Results from a variety of experimental techniques which have been used to define the oxidation levels of Mn and other components in the S states of the water oxidising complex in Photosystem II are reviewed. A self-consistent interpretation of Mn X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy, UV-visible and near infrared spectroscopic data suggests that Mn oxidation occurs only on the S-0-->S-1 transition, and that all four Mn centres have formal oxidation state III thereafter. Ligand oxidation occurs on the transitions to S-2 and S-3. This is supported by high level quantum chemical calculations and an analysis of the kinetics of substrate water exchange, as recently determined by Wydrzynski et al. (this journal). One type of model for the catalytic site structure and water oxidation mechanism, consistent with these conclusions, is discussed. This model invokes magnetically separate oxo bridged dimers with water oxidation occurring by a concerted 2H(+)/2e(-) transfer mechanism, with one H transfer to a bridge oxygen on each dimer.

The preparing procedure allows the NixCo1-xP nanoparticles (NPs) to disperse on the surface of Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanorods uniformly and produce intimate contact interfaces. The photocatalytic H-2 production activity of Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanorods is remarkably improved by introducing noble metal free NixCo1-xP promotors. Especially, the nanohybrid of 4 mol% Ni0.1Co0.9P-Zn0.5Cd0.5S shows the highest photocatalytic performance with a H-2 evolution rate of 976 mu mol.h(-1), which is 11.7 folds higher than obtained with pure Zn0.5Cd0.5S. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of the hybrid photocatalyst is estimated to be 19.7% at monochromatic 420 nm. The catalytic activity is still stable after 16 h cycling experiments. Moreover, based on the calculation of density function theory (DFT), the rational mechanism of photocatalytic has been proposed and is well consistent with the experimental results. In addition, the formed coordination bond between Zn0.5Cd0.5S and Ni0.1Co0.9P on their surface plays an important role in charge separation and transfer. Our study not only demonstrates a facile and scalable strategy to synthesize highly efficient photocatalysts, but also provides a new viewpoint of the rational design and synthesis of advanced photocatalysts by harnessing the strong synergistic effects through simultaneously tuning the ratio of metal in metal phosphides.									54	5	0	0	8	0	54			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000487764800142

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis shows that the particle sizes of pure cadmium sulfide (pu/CdS) and histidine decorated cadmium sulfide prepared by the hydrothermal method (hi/CdS) range from 0.75 to 3.0 mu m. However, when a solvothermal method is used, the particle size of histidine decorated cadmium sulfide (so/CdS) ranges from 50 to 300 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns show that all samples (pu/CdS, hi/CdS and so/CdS) have a hexagonal wurtzite crystal structure but so/CdS has a poor crystallinity compared to the others. The as-prepared samples are applied to photocatalytic hydrogen production via water splitting and the results show that the highest H(2)evolution rate for pu/CdS and hi/CdS are 1250 and 1950 mu mol center dot g(-1)center dot h(-1), respectively. On the other hand, the so/CdS sample has a rate of 6020 mu mol center dot g(-1)center dot h(-1), which is about five times higher than that of the pu/CdS sample. The increased specific surface area of so/CdS nanoparticles and effective charge separation by histidine molecules are attributed to the improved H(2)evolution.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2				1996-1073		WOS:000556493700001

Single-crystal structural determinations reveal that 1 is a robust pillared-layer framework with unusual 72-membered {Cu-6(tpt)(6)} macrocycle-based layers supported by tetratopic L4- connectors. Both 2 and 3 are isostructural (4 4) sheets with octahedral Ni-II and Co-II ions extended by ditopic L4- and tpt linkages, in which the third pyridyl group of tpt is capped by pentahydrated metal ions. Due to the narrowed bandgap and good charge transport of the mixed-valence Cu-I/II centers, 1 exhibits improved dual-functional catalytic activities than 2 and 3 with the visible-light-driven hydrogen evolution rate and RhB degradation efficiency up to 588 mu mol center dot g(-1)center dot h(-1) and 72 % after 180-minute irradiation. These interesting results indicate the importance of the metal ions and the dimensionality of the coordination polymers on the activity of the non-Pt coordination polymer photocatalytic systems.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0044-2313	1521-3749		WOS:000588127000001

Here, we have investigated the amount of tungsten dopant influencing the photocatalytic water oxidation activity of LaTiO2N (LTON) crystals grown directly by an NH3-assisted KCl flux method in the absence of a cocatalyst. With the maximum amount of tungsten dopant (x = 0.10), LaWO0.6N2.4 was formed as a minor phase to a W-doped LaTiO2N phase (W-LTON). The optimum W-doped LaTiO2N crystals were grown with the tungsten amount of x = 0.05, showing a nearly three-fold higher O-2 evolution rate (51 mu mol h(-1)) compared to pure LaTiO2N crystals (18 mu mol h(-1)). The improvement in the O-2 evolution rate of the LaTiO2N crystals was presumably due to the improved conductivity, enhanced light absorption and efficient charge separation stemmed from tungsten doping. According to first-principles density function theory (DFT) calculations, although no significant change in band gap by tungsten doping was observed, slight broadening of valence and conduction bands was noted in W-LTON which may improve the electron/hole conductivity due to reduction of the effective mass of electrons. Also, tungsten doping was beneficial in creating effective defects and in enhancing the photocatalytic water oxidation activity of the LaTiO2N crystals.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000379438000015

LCO shows good chemical compatibility with BZCYYb. The readily fabricated LCO/BZCYYb bilayer electrolyte can be densified at a temperature of as low as 1300 degrees C versus similar to 1600 degrees C for the benchmark steam-stable BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-delta electrolyte. With Pr2NiO4+delta as the anode and Ni as the cathode catalyst, this bilayer electrolyte cell yields a current density of 975 and 300 mA/cm(2) under a 1.3 V applied potential at 700 and 600 degrees C, respectively. This performance is among the best of all H-SOECs equipped with a chemically stable electrolyte so far. A BZCYYb layer in the bilayer electrolyte promotes the hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode side, resulting in a 108% improvement over the cell without this layer. The LCO layer, on the other hand, effectively protects this functional BZCYYb layer from the high concentration of steam in a practical SOEC operation condition. The cell without the LCO layer shows degradation in terms of an increased electrolyzing potential from 1.07 to 1.29 V during a constant 400 mA/cm(2) operation at 700 degrees C. In contrast, the bilayer electrolyte cell maintains the same electrolyzing potential of 1.13 V under the same conduction for a 102 h operation. These findings demonstrate that this synergic bilayer electrolyte design is a vital strategy to overcome the dilemma between performance and stability faced by the current benchmark Zr- or Ce-rich Ba(CeZr)O3-delta electrolysis cells to achieve excellent performance and stability at the same time.									27	2	0	0	1	0	28			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000469288300026	31051074

The contents of Pb and S in the S-doped AuPb NWNs are optimized in order to create the appropriate content of PtS in the resulting S-doped AuPbPt alloy NWNs because Pb in both AuPb3 and PbS is involved with the formation of PtS and PbPtx during the conversion of S-doped AuPb NWNs to S-doped AuPbPt alloy NWNs. Moreover, the formation of an optimal content of PtS in the resulting S-doped AuPbPt alloy NWNs remarkably downshifts the d-band center of Pt, on the basis of results from X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and then improves the resistance of active Pt sites against oxidation and in turn renders the Pt surfaces more catalytically active for the ORR and more structurally stable. Furthermore, the as-prepared S-doped AuPbPt alloy NWNs indeed exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity towards both the ORR (e.g., E-onset = 1.047 V and E-1/2 = 0.921 V) and HER (E-onset = -2 mV and overpotential of 12 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) in acidic media with excellent durability because of the presence of an optimal amount of PtS, based on the results of control experiments and DFT calculations.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000593047100017

On the contrary wine decay was significantly delayed when it was stored in the horizontal position, independently from the closure system used.									20	0	0	0	9	0	20			2214-2894			WOS:000416808800006

These objects belong to the class of asymptotic giant branch stars, experiencing thermal instabilities in the He-burning shell (thermal pulses). Mixing episodes called third dredge-up enrich the photosphere with newly synthesized C-12 in the He-rich zone, and this is the source of the high observed ratio between carbon and oxygen (C/O greater than or equal to1 by number). Our spectroscopic abundance estimates confirm that, in agreement with the general understanding of the late evolutionary stages of low- and intermediate-mass stars, carbon enrichment is accompanied by the appearance of s-process elements in the photosphere. We discuss the details of the observations and of the derived abundances, focusing in particular on rubidium, a neutron density sensitive element, and on the s-elements Sr, Y, and Zr belonging to the first s-peak. The critical reaction branching at Kr-85, which determines the relative enrichment of the studied species, is discussed. Subsequently, we compare our data with recent models for s-processing in thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch stars, at metallicities relevant for our sample. A remarkable agreement between model predictions and observations is found. Thanks to the different neutron density prevailing in low- and intermediate-mass stars, comparison with the models allows us to conclude that most C(N) stars are of low mass (M less than or similar to 3M(circle dot)). We also analyze the C-12/C-13 ratios measured, showing that most of them cannot be explained by canonical stellar models. We discuss how this fact would require the operation of an ad hoc additional mixing, currently called cool bottom process, operating only in low-mass stars during the first ascent of the red giant branch and, perhaps, also during the asymptotic giant branch.									157	0	0	0	1	0	157			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000171439800047		
J	Chen, Wen-Tong								Synthesis and characterization of a novel Europium(III) complex with a one-dimensional chain-like structure								JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY				294						121818	10.1016/j.jssc.2020.121818		JAN 2021		FEB 2021	2021	By means of a solvothermal reaction of isonicotinic acid and europium perchlorate, a novel europium(III) com- plex, i.e. catena- [tri(mu(2)-isonicotinato-O,O')-(biaqua-europium(III))-(triperchlorate)-(monohydrate)1, Mu(HIA)(3)(H2O)(2)](n)center dot 3n(ClO4)-nH(2)O (1; HIA = isonicotinic acid), was obtained. The molecular structure of complex 1 was characterized by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. Complex 1 crystallized in the space group P (1) over bar of the triclinic system with a = 9.5500(2), b = 10.9680(3), c = 15.1214(4) angstrom, a = 104.299(2)degrees, beta = 91.532(2)degrees, gamma = 111.310(2)degrees, V = 1417.92(6) angstrom(3), C18H21Cl3EuN3O21, M-r = 873.69, Z = 2, D-c = 2.046 g/cm(3), mu(MoK alpha) = 2.595 mm(-1) and F(000) = 864. The europium(III)) ions are coordinated by eight oxygen atoms (of which six come from six HIA ligands and two come from two water molecules) and displays a EuO8 square antiprismatic geometry. The adjacent europium(III) ions are interlinked by four or two mu(2)-bridging HIA ligands to generate an infinite onedimensional (1-D) -Eu-(HIA)(4)-Eu-(HIA)(2)-Eu-(HIA)(4)-Eu- chain running along the a axis. The chains are further connected by pi...pi stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions to yield a three-dimensional (3-D) su- pramolecular network. Complex 1 exhibits red photoluminescence emission bands at 593 nm, 617 nm and 699 nm, which are originated from the D-5(0) -> F-7(1), D-5(0) -> F-7(2) and D-5(0 )-> F-7(4) characteristic transitions of europium(III) ions. It has CIE chromaticity coordinates of (0.5742, 0.3275). A solid-state UV/Vis diffuse reflection spectrum shows that complex 1 has a band gap of 5.02 eV with a direct transition process.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000607851200007

P-styrene sulfonate anions were used to intercalate into the bulk graphite under voltage and also as monomers of the macromolecule modification agents for the exfoliated graphene nanosheets. Besides, benzene rings and carbon double bonds are considered to be able to capture hydroxyl free radicals which produce defects on graphene sheets during electrochemical exfoliation process, thus improve the quality of the exfoliated graphene nanosheets. Then the graphene nanosheets were incorporated into polystyrene (PS) through a solution blending method to reduce the fire hazards and improve mechanical properties of PS resin. According to the results of cone calorimeter, the introduction of functionalized graphene nanosheets into PS reduces heat release rate (decreased by 40%), total heat release (decreased by 35%) and increases the amount of char residues. The flame retardant improvement is attributed to the barrier effect of well-dispersed graphene nanosheets, limiting the mass transfer of the volatile compounds and forming char layers which blocked polymers from heat and oxygen. Meanwhile, the introduction of PSS@GNS into PS also contributed to increase its strength and elongation rate thanks to the pristine properties of graphene nanosheets and their interfacial interaction with the PS matrix.									21	0	0	0	3	1	21			1359-8368	1879-1069		WOS:000505108700006

During the past decade, remarkable progress in organometallic chemistry has set the stage for the development of increasingly viable metal catalysts for C-H bond activation reactions. Among these methods, oxidative C-H bond functionalizations are particularly attractive because they avoid the use of prefunctionalized starting materials. For example, oxidative annulations that Involve sequential C-H and heteroatom-H bond deavages allow for the modular assembly of regioselectively decorated heterocydes. These structures serve as key scaffolds for natural products, functional materials, crop protecting agents, and drugs. While other researchers have devised rhodium or palladium complexes for oxidative alkyne annulations, my laboratory has focused on the application of significantly less expensive, yet highly selective ruthenium complexes.This Account summarizes the evolution of versatile ruthenium(II) complexes for annulations of alkynes via C-H/N-H, C-H/O-H, or C-H/N-O bond deavages. To achieve selective C-H bond functionalizations, we needed to understand the detailed mechanism of the crucial C-H bond metalation with ruthenium(II) complexes and particularly the importance of carboxylate assistance in this process. As a consequence, our recent efforts have resulted in widely applicable methods for the versatile preparation of differently decorated arenes and heteroarenes, providing access to among others isoquinolones, 2-pyridones, isoquinolines, indoles, pyrroles, or alpha-pyrones. Most of these reactions used Cu(OAc)(2)center dot H2O, which not only acted as the oxidant but also served as the essential source of acetate for the carboxylate-assisted ruthenation manifold. Notably, the ruthenium(11)-catalyzed oxidative annulations also occurred under an ambient atmosphere of air with cocatalytic amounts of Cu(OAc)(2)center dot H2O. Moreover, substrates displaying N-O bonds served as "internal oxidants" for the syntheses of isoquinolones and isoquinolines. Detailed experimental mechanistic studies have provided strong support for a catalytic cycle that relies on initial carboxylate-assisted C-H bond ruthenation, followed by coordinative insertion of the alkyne, reductive elimination, and reoxidation of the thus formed ruthenium(0) complex.									1375	38	0	0	362	0	1379			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000331775200001	23379589

The suitable band structure and superior electronic reduction capability of CdS in CdS@Ti3C2 composites are achieved, efficiently prolong the light absorption range and enhance photocatalytic performance of CdS. Moreover, Ti3C2 MXene NSs with good electronic transfer capability can prevent photoinduced carrier recombination, and the accordion-like multilayer can provide more reactive sites. The best sample of CdS@Ti3C2 with 15 mg Ti3C2 MXene adding amount exhibits super good photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate (63.53 mu mol h(-1)), and photocatalytic nitrogen fixation rate of 293.06 mu mol L-1 h(-1). The corresponding apparent quantum efficiencies (AQE) are 2.28% and 7.88%, respectively, higher than those of pure CdS NRs and CdS@Pt (0.1 wt%).

The main goal was to follow the changes of the stoichiometry of the surface with O2 exposure exploiting the topmost surface layer sensitivity of ISS. Simultaneous ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS/He II, 40.81 eV) analysis allowed to determine related changes of the valence electrons which are responsible for the chemical reactivity of the surface. The ISS/He+ data show that at an exposure of L almost-equal-to 3 langmuir of O2 no Ni atoms are detected in the topmost surface layer. However, the less surface-sensitive UPS spectra still reveal the presence of Ni in the surface. Submitting the sample to higher exposure ISS shows a He+/O contribution, which increases with the exposure, but a constant He+/U peak intensity. The UPS spectra confirm previous results: the U metal derived 5f peak at the Fermi-edge disappears, the U dioxide derived 5f2 peak increases and the O 2p line is no more symmetric and develops a shoulder at higher binding energy. At high exposure values the surface will be composed of UO2 with Ni metal below the topmost layer. The ISS data suggest that an exponential (e(-L/alpha)) will describe the evolution of the U concentration with alpha almost-equal-to 2.7 langmuir. The UPS data suggest that the evolution of the O 2p intensity can also be described by (1-e(-L/beta)) with beta almost-equal-to 2-alpha almost-equal-to 5.4 langmuir.					11TH EUROPEAN CONF ON SURFACE SCIENCE ( ECOSS-11 )11TH EUROPEAN CONF ON SURFACE SCIENCE ( ECOSS-11 )	OCT 01-04, 1990OCT 01-04, 1990	EUROPEAN PHYS SOC, DIV CONDENSED MATTER, INTERFACE SECT; INT UNION VACUUM SCI TECH & APPL, DIV SURFACE SCIEUROPEAN PHYS SOC, DIV CONDENSED MATTER, INTERFACE SECT; INT UNION VACUUM SCI TECH & APPL, DIV SURFACE SCI	UNIV SALAMANCA, SALAMANCA, SPAINUNIV SALAMANCA, SALAMANCA, SPAIN	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0039-6028			WOS:A1991FY12600183

However, how the Pacific plate subduction has affected the off-craton lithospheric mantle in northeastern China is less clear, as few studies have focused on the lithospheric mantle-derived xenoliths in that region. We report petrography, mineral and rock chemistry, and in situ isotopic compositions of Sr in clinopyroxene and O in olivine for 20 peridotite and 11 pyroxenite xenoliths hosted by the Cenozoic volcanic rocks at Jiaohe and Shuangliao localities. The peridotites include lherzolites, harzburgites, and a wehrlite, many are metasomatized. Group 1 garnet pyroxenites have high Al2O3, Ni, and Mg#; positive Eu and Sr anomalies; and olivine delta O-18 values of 4.8-5.1, which we attribute to recycling of oceanic crustal components to the asthenosphere and their reactions with host peridotites. Groups 2 and 3 pyroxenites are garnet-free and contain peridotite-like pyroxenes; we argue that they were formed by reactions of lithospheric peridotites with evolved melts derived from recycled oceanic crust. In addition, one pyroxenite contains orthopyroxene surrounded by fine-grained olivine and clinopyroxene, while another pyroxenite and the wehrlite contain zoned clinopyroxene with gradual increases in Na2O, (La/Yb)(N), Sr, and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios and decreases in Ti/Eu from core to rim. These characteristics record infiltration of a carbonatite melt shortly before the transport of the xenoliths. The inferred carbonatite melt has Sr-87/Sr-86 >= 0.70415 and mantle-like olivine delta O-18 and originated from carbonated asthenosphere. Our results, together with previous studies on the host basalts, suggest that subducted crustal materials were initially transported to the asthenosphere beneath northeastern China to produce carbonate-bearing domains. Upwelling of the carbonated asthenosphere produced carbonatite melts that migrated upward and metasomatized the overlying lithospheric mantle.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2169-9313	2169-9356		WOS:000530897700033

Experimentally, HOF microrods with an in situ polymerized dopamine (DA) overlayer are coordinated with Co2+ cations and used as a precursor. After pyrolyzing the Co@DA-HOF precursor, irregular sheet-like carbons comprising a large number of Co nanoparticles as well as abundant mesopores are obtained (Co@MPC-T). The thermal decomposition of melamine-containing HOF microrods during high-temperature pyrolysis helps generate the abundant porous structures in the resulting catalyst samples. Thus, synthesized Co@MPC-T catalysts display an apparent ORR activity, and the one pyrolyzed at 800 degrees C is determined to show the highest ORR catalytic activity among the series, with a half-wave potential of +0.796V, a diffusion-limiting current density of 5.492mAcm(-2) at +0.200V and a kinetic current of 51.40mAcm(-2) that is even two times higher than the 20.10mAcm(-2) for commercial Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, benefiting from the protection of graphitized carbon overlayer, Co@MPC-800 shows a substantially higher operation stability as well as superior tolerance to fuel crossover, as compared with the commercial Pt/C catalyst. The remarkable ORR performance of Co@MPC-800 highlights the high potential of graphitized two-dimensional carbon composites with nonprecious transition metal nanoparticles in electrocatalysis.									8	1	0	0	0	0	9			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000452712800036

Chars are formed during slow pyrolysis on addition of alkali ternary eutectic salts (Li2CO3: 43.5%, Na2CO3: 31.5%, K2CO3: 25% mol), subjected to two different higher heating temperatures (350 degrees C and 600 degrees C). It is shown here that the addition of a carbonate eutectic affects char-making reactions through: tar generation modification, changes in the emitted volatile molecules, alteration of surface oxygenate bonds as well as transformation in the morphology of the remnant char. Initial results using Differential Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (DTG) show that, in carbonate treated samples, char yield is increased at both temperatures investigated. In treated cellulose, a reduced temperature onset of mass loss is observed, expected to be from modified depolymerisation and inhibition of levoglucosan formation for samples heated to both 350 degrees C and 600 degrees C. Gas analysis by micro-GC proves that carbonate is involved in the cracking of condensable volatiles, which generates a highly porous char structure and increases the emission of non-condensable volatiles. In addition, SEM results for carbonate treated cellulose demonstrate extensive pore generation including both surface and internally generated pores and interconnected tunnel-like structures at higher temperature (600 degrees C). This was not reflected however in BET results due to the melted salt blocking the available internal porous structure. Improvement in BET results for chars produced at 600 degrees C was regardless seen on carbonate addition in both biomass (improving from 371 m(2) g(-1) to 516 m(2) g(-1)) and lignin (improving from 11 m(2) g(-1) to 209 m(2) g(-1)).									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2398-4902			WOS:000593581500006

Here we demonstrate an effective strategy to control the dimensionality and morphology of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) through heat treatment the melamine-cyanuric acid supramolecular precursors formed in water as a "green" solvent. By varying heat treatments, the three-dimensional (3D) hexagonal prism precursors could be transformed to 3D g-C3N4 loofah-like (CNl) architectures, ultrathin two-dimensional (2D)g-C(3)N(4 )nanosheets (CNs), and ordered one-dimensional (1D) g-C3N4 nanotube (CNt) array, respectively. The adsorbed melamine molecules on the surface of precursor and atmosphere in the transformation process, play a key role in determining the morphology of products. The resulting ultrathin 2D CNs have a porous structure, a small thickness (1.6 nm), a large surface area (208.8 m(2).g(-1)), and high conductivity, thus exhibiting higher hydrogen evolution rate (23.9 mu mol h(-1)) by 17.3 times than the bulk g-C3N4 (CN) under visible light irradiation. This strategy results in high-quality, ultrathin CNs at yields of similar to 10 wt% from raw material, much higher than those of previous reports (similar to 6 wt% from bulk CN). This work not only enriches our understanding of the relationship between geometric dimensionality, morphology and properties of photocatalytic nanomaterials, but also could be potentially useful for the design and growth of 1D or 2D flexible polymers for energy-related applications and beyond.									88	6	0	0	9	0	89			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000472697500032

Here, we extend the technique to probing the interfacial dynamics and structure of a silica surface-tethered transition metal carbonyl complex-tricarbonyl (1,10-phenanthroline) rhenium chloride-of interest as a photoreduction catalyst. We interpret the data using a theoretical framework devised to separate the roles of structural evolution and excitation transfer in inducing spectral diffusion. The structural dynamics, as reported on by a carbonyl stretch vibration of the surface-bound complex, have a characteristic time of similar to 150 picoseconds in the absence of solvent, decrease in duration by a factor of three upon addition of chloroform, and decrease another order of magnitude for the bulk solution. Conversely, solvent-complex interactions increase the lifetime of the probed vibration by 160% when solvent is applied to the monolayer.									99	1	0	0	12	0	99			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000296494700045	22021674

The low efficiency of hydrogen production, high overpotentials and expensive noble-metal catalysts have limited the development of hydrogen production from electrocatalytic water splitting. Therefore, the exploration of bifunctional electrocatalysts for water overall splitting to produce hydrogen is of profound significance. Herein, Ni3S2@Ni2P/MoS2 heterostructure electrocatalysts were synthesized on Ni foam through an environmentally friendly hydrothermal method and low-temperature phosphating method. The synergistic effects between different components and the mutual substitution principle between sulfur atoms and phosphorus atoms greatly improve the OER performance of the electrocatalyst. It is also an effective strategy to optimize the adsorption energies of intermediates by the design of heterostructured catalysts composed of multiple substances. Ni3S2@Ni2P/MoS2 only requires a low overpotential (eta(10)) of 175 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution and the stable duration exceeds 40 h. In addition, this heterogeneous structure is assembled into an electrolytic cell for overall water splitting, which exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.61 volts and retains the robust stability over 30 h at 10 mA cm(-2). The Ni3S2@Ni2P/MoS2 heterostructure prepared in this research provides a strategy for exploring other heterostructured electrocatalysts with different components.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000703779700001	34610629	
J	Lallement, Rosine								Some Observations Related to the Origin and Evolution of the Local Bubble/Local ISM								SPACE SCIENCE REVIEWS				143	1-4			427	436		10.1007/s11214-008-9428-y				MAR 2009	2009	I discuss some recent observations of the Local Interstellar medium (ISM) that are related to its history and temperature structure. I focus on three topics: (i) the abundance pattern of interstellar deuterium and metals, (ii) highly charged ion data, (iii) soft X-ray data.Deuterium has been unambiguously shown to correlate almost linearly with refractory metals, confirming that interstellar grains are a "reservoir" of deuterium, and release it into the gaseous phase jointly with metals when the gas is shocked and heated. By interpreting the observed level of deuterium with respect to the abundance patterns of metals and oxygen, these data give some clues to the event, which gave rise to the expanding Gould belt. As a matter of fact abundance data seem to be linked to the belt, and the observed trends suggest an explosive origin, rather than a collision with an external cloud made of unastrated material.X-rays and high ions trace hot gas and interfaces between hot and cool gas. However absorption lines of high ions show highly complex characteristics and no relationships have been established yet between their detected columns and the existence of hot-cool gas interfaces. Adding to the complexity, the X-ray emission through charge-exchange reactions between highly charged solar wind ions and neutrals plays a significant role, calling for modifications of the global picture of the LISM. In addition to the ubiquitous contamination of background data by locally emitted X-rays, there are also potential distant charge transfer (CX) X-ray emissions from clouds-hot gas interfaces.There is a strong need for high quality, high spectral resolution X-ray data, because X-ray lines emitted after charge-transfer neutralization of helium-like ions bear a clear signature of the charge transfer process, if present, and allow to disentangle thermal and CX emission. More precise density and velocity distributions of the local ISM are also needed to take full advantage of the X-ray and high ion data and build a consistent picture of the Local Cavity (LC) and its surroundings. As an example of these requirements I discuss the case of the North Polar Spur for which there may be some evidence for CX emission.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			0038-6308	1572-9672		WOS:000263799300032

The latter approach is considered to be more efficient but also more expensive as it requires Pt and Ir based catalysts. This study reports on an alkaline water electrolyzer with Ni electrodes that operates at a current density of 2 A/cm(2) with a cell voltage of 1.85 V, which provides a comparable voltage-current characteristic to the state-of-the-art PEM water electrolyzers. Thin Ni mesh electrodes with surface areas that are thousand times higher than the geometric area were manufactured by an easily scalable and cheap process, i.e. metallurgical hot dip galvanization with subsequent de-alloying. With a thin porous polymer of approximately 140 mu m as the diaphragm a low cell resistance of 0.11 Omega cm(-2) was obtained. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

When the calcination temperature increased up to 1200 degrees C, primary particles grew significantly while the microspherical morphology of the secondary particles was kept. Dynamic light scattering analysis proved well-dispersive nature of the SD sample. Photocatalytic activities of SrTiO3:Rh synthesized by the SD method, solid state reaction (SSR), and a poly-merizable complex (PC) method were evaluated for H-2 evolution using an electron donor such as methanol, Fe2+, or [Co(bPY)(3)](2+) and Z-scheme water splitting combined with BiVO4 of an O-2-evolving photocatalyst and either Fe3+/2+, [Co(bpy)(3)](3+/2+), or reduced graphene oxide as an electron mediator. SrTiO3:Rh prepared by the SD method showed much higher activities for all Z-scheme water splitting than the samples synthesized by the SSR method. Activities of the SD sample for Z-scheme water splitting using electron shuttles, Fe3+/2+ and [Co(bpy)(3)](3+/2+), were slightly higher or comparable to those of the PC sample whereas the SD sample achieved higher activity in Z-scheme water splitting based on interparticle electron transfer. In addition, even when the mass of SrTiO3:Rh used for the Z-scheme system with Fe3+/2+ was decreased from 50 mg to 30 mg, the SD sample still showed high activity while the activity decreased for the SSR and PC samples. Thus, usefulness of the SD method to obtain highly active SrTiO3:Rh with well-dispersive nature has been demonstrated.									20	2	0	0	0	0	21			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000469906200024

To acquire catalysts with higher photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency, we synthesized ZnCdS catalysts from a hydrothermal method and the WO3 cocatalyst through temperature programmed reduction. The surface morphology and optical properties of the catalysts were characterized via X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and UV-Vis spectroscopy, which proved the successful synthesis of the WO3/ZnCdS compound catalysts. The effects of WO3 dosage on the photocatalytic activity of ZnCdS were studied, and in particular, the hydrogen production activity of the 35 wt% WO3/ZnCdS was the highest to 98.68 mu mol/mg, about 9.6 times that of pure ZnCdS (10.28 mu mol/mg). After 5 cycles, it yet had high repeatability and preserved high hydrogen production activity after 100 h of photocatalytic tests. The underlying mechanism was explored via photoluminescence and photocurrent assays. It was found the 35 wt% WO3/ZnCdS generated higher photocurrent than pure ZnCdS, indicating WO3 could facilitate electron transfer to involve more electrons in hydrolysis reactions, thereby increasing the photoelectron use efficiency and photocatalytic hydrogen production activity.

Control of this disease is achieved mainly by integration of different disease management procedures. However, the constant evolution of the pathogen drives the necessity to broaden the molecular basis of resistance to Fop. Our proteomic study was performed on pea with the aim of identifying proteins involved in different resistance mechanisms operating during F. oxysporum infection. For such purpose, we used a two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled to mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF) analysis to study the root proteome of three pea genotypes showing different resistance response to Fop race 2.Multivariate statistical analysis identified 132 differential protein spots under the experimental conditions (genotypes/treatments). All of these protein spots were subjected to mass spectrometry analysis to deduce their possible functions. A total of 53 proteins were identified using a combination of peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) and MSMS fragmentation. The following main functional categories were assigned to the identified proteins: carbohydrate and energy metabolism, nucleotides and aminoacid metabolism, signal transduction and cellular process, folding and degradation, redox and homeostasis, defense, biosynthetic process and transcription/translation. Results obtained in this work suggest that the most susceptible genotypes have increased levels of enzymes involved in the production of reducing "power which could then be used as cofactor for enzymes of the redox reactions. This is in concordance with the fact that a ROS burst occurred in the same genotypes, as well as an increase of PR proteins. Conversely, in the resistant genotype proteins responsible to induce changes in the membrane and cell wall composition related to reinforcement were identified. Results are discussed in terms of the differential response to Fop. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									19	0	0	0	16	0	19			0031-9422			WOS:000357237900004	25672548

The results indicated that when the mass ratio of CoTPP to GO is 1:15, the performance of the composite is the best. The test of Raman and SEM revealed that the surface disorder of CoTPP/GO material was increased as compared to GO. This change is beneficial for the charge tran4er of the HER. EIS test 'results showed the resistance of GO was reduced from 1.180 Omega to 734 Omega of CoTPP/GO. The HER onset overpotential of material was reduced from -761 mV of GO to -337 mV of CoTPP/GO. Tafel slope was reduced from 296 mV/dec of GO to 174 MV/dec of CoTPP/GO, while the Faraday efficiency was increased from 23% to 87%. After adding diphenyl sulfide (SPh2) axial ligand the HER onset overpotential of CoTPP (SMh(2))/GO material was further reduced to -235 mV. Tafel slope was also reduced to 163 mV/dec and Faraday efficiency was increased to 94%. These results indicate that the self-assembly of graphene oxide and metalloporphyrin is an effective way to construct graphene-based metalloporphyrin electrocatalytic HER materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0251-0790			WOS:000765114700003

In this work, a convenient nitriding-pretreatment route has been applied to engineer the C vacancy defects in Ti3C2Tx MXene, which often results in the structural instability. Based on the above defect engineering, the 2D skeleton is maintained in the following Ti3C2Tx oxidation for the formation of TiO2 and carbon layers. Successfully, a "from 2D to 2D" structure and functional transformation is realized and TiO2 nanoplates are in-situ grown between carbon layers, which greatly boost photogenerated carrier's separation and electron's transmission. As a result, this TiO2/C superstructure exhibits an efficient photocatalytic ability in water-splitting process under visible light without any cocatalyst (87.2 mu mol g(-1)h(-1) 28.1 times of disordered TiO2/C sample). The defect engineering for MXene provides a new strategy for the highly orderly layer-by-layer superstructure.									31	2	0	0	3	0	31			0926-860X	1873-3875		WOS:000509617200036

In the past few years, great progress has been achieved in the field of NMSACs, including the structure and local coordination environment modifications, which significantly promote the electrochemical performance toward water splitting and deepen the understandings of the underlying mechanisms. Herein, in this review, the recent advances of the NMSACs in the field of water splitting applications have been comprehensively summarized, with a special emphasis on the advantages, synthetic strategies, and characterizations of the NMSACs. Moreover, some representative examples regarding the applications of NMSACs toward water splitting are also manifested according to the theoretical and experimental results. Furthermore, the challenges and future potentials of the NMSACs are also manifested to offer guidance for the development of more advanced NMSACs.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

J	Dzik, Jolanta M.								The ancestry and cumulative evolution of immune reactions								ACTA BIOCHIMICA POLONICA				57	4			443	466						2010	2010	The last two decades of study enriched greatly our knowledge of how the immune system originated and the sophisticated immune mechanisms of today's vertebrates and invertebrates developed. Even unicellular organisms possess mechanisms for pathogen destruction and self recognition. The ability to distinguish self from non-self is a prerequisite for recognition of sexual compatibility and ensuring survival. Molecules involved in these processes resemble those found in the phagocytic cells of higher organisms. Recognition of bacteria by scavenger receptors induces phagocytosis or endocytosis. The phagocytic mechanisms characterizing the amoeboid protozoans developed further during the evolution towards innate immunity. The scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain SRCR is encoded in the genomes from the most primitive sponges to mammals. The immune system of sponges comprises signal transduction molecules which occur in higher metazoans as well. Sponges already possess recognition systems for pathogenic bacteria and fungi, based on membrane receptors (a lipopolysaccharide-interacting protein, a cell surface receptor recognizing beta(1 -> 3)-D-glucans of fungi). Perforin-like molecules and lysozymes are involved, among others, in defense in sponges. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species function in the immunity of early metazoan. Genes encoding the family of reactive oxygen-generating NADPH oxidases (Noxes) are found in a variety of protists and plants. The NO synthases of cnidarians, mollusks, and chordates are conserved with respect to the mammalian NOS. The antimicrobial peptides of protozoans, amoebapores, are structural and functional analogs of the natural killer cell peptide, NK-lysin, of vertebrates. An ancestral S-type lectin has been found in sponges. Opsonizing properties of lectins and the ability to agglutinate cells justify their classification as primitive recognition molecules. Invertebrate cytokines are not homologous to those of vertebrate, and their functional convergence was presumably enabled by the general similarity of the lectin-like recognition domain three-dimensional structure. Sponges contain molecules with SCR/CCP domains that show high homology to the mammalian regulators of complement activation (RCA family). A multi-component complement system comprising at least the central molecule of the complement system, C3, Factor B, and MASP developed in the cnidarians and evolved into the multilevel cascade engaged in innate and acquired immunity of vertebrates. The adaptive immune system of mammals is also deeply rooted in the metazoan evolution. Some its precursors have been traced as deep as in sponges, namely, two classes of receptors that comprise Ig-like domains, the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), and the non-enzymic sponge adhesion molecules (SAM). The antibody-based immune system defined by the presence of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), T-cell receptor (TCR), B-cell receptor (BCR) or recombination activating genes (RAGs) is known beginning from jawed fishes. However, genes closely resembling RAG1 and RAG2 have been uncovered in the genome of a see urchin. The ancestry of MHC gene remains unknown. Similarly, no homologue of the protein binding domain (PBD) in MHC molecules has been found in invertebrates. The pathway by which endogenous peptides are degraded for presentation with class I MHC molecules utilizes mechanisms similar to those involved in the normal turnover of intracellular proteins, apparently recruited to work also for the immune system.Several cDNAs coding for lysosomal enzymes e.g., cathepsin, have been isolated from sponges. All chromosomal duplication events in the MHC region occurred after the origin of the agnathans but before the gnathostomes split from them. The V-domains of the subtype found in the receptors of T and B-cells are known from both agnathans and cephalochordates, although they do not rearrange. The rearrangement mechanism of the lymphocyte V-domains suggests its origin from a common ancestral domain existing before the divergence of the extant gnathostome classes. Activation-induced deaminase (AID) - homologous proteins have been found only in the gnathostomes. It appears thus that the adaptive immunity of vertebrates is a result of stepwise accumulation of small changes in molecules, cells and organs over almost half a billion years.					16th European Bioenergetics Conference16th European Bioenergetics Conference	JUL 17-22, 2010JUL 17-22, 2010	Nencki Inst Expt Biol; Polish Biochem Soc, Sect BioenergetNencki Inst Expt Biol; Polish Biochem Soc, Sect Bioenerget	Univ Warsaw, Old Lib, Warsaw, POLANDUniv Warsaw, Old Lib, Warsaw, POLAND	80	1	2	0	59	0	82			0001-527X	1734-154X		WOS:000285726300010	21046016

Therefore, it can be inferred that engineering element-doping and exfoliation into g-C3N4 would further enhance the photocatalytic performance. Herein, we demonstrated a KOH-assisted hydrothermal-reformed melamine strategy for achieving the simultaneous K-doping and exfoliation of g-C3N4. The as synthesized K-doped g-C3N4 ultrathin nanosheets displayed much enhanced photo catalytic hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of about 13.1 times higher than that of the bulk g-C3N4 under visible-light irradiation, achieving an apparent quantum efficiency of 6.98% at 420 nm. The improved photocatalytic HER can be attributed to the high surface area offering numerous photocatalytic active sites, enlarged conductive band edge optimizing photoreduction potential, and K-doping promoting charge generation and separation as well as the long life-time of photogenerated carriers. This work would provide a promising way to integrate co-doping and exfoliation into new g-C3N4-based materials. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

CL spectra, collected on different types of photocatalytically efficient or inefficient anatase films, embodied a composite optical response of electron-compensating majority types of ionic disorder in the anatase lattice. This paper describes the dual experimental output obtained by systematically monitoring optically active off-stoichiometry sites, as follows: (i) quantitative analyses of film stoichiometry including the interactions of different lattice-defect populations; and (ii) stability/evolution of off-stoichiometry sites upon post-fabrication annealing cycles and their effects on the photocatalytic activity of the films. CL experiments provided us with direct access to the structural state of the defective anatase lattice, thus unfolding some missing detail about the complex physicochemical interactions behind its photocatalytic efficiency.

The methods employed include microthermometry, micro-Raman spectroscopy, K/Na thermometry, and stable isotope analysis.Early fluid inclusions provide evidence of close to peak metamorphic temperatures of the late Tertiary or neo-alpine metamorphic event. Fluid composition evolved along the geotraverse from north to south as follows: higher hydrocarbons were dominant in the low- and medium-grade diagenetic zones, methane was the main volatile in the high-grade diagenetic and low-grade anchizone, water dominated in the high-grade anchizone and low-grade epizone, with CO2 > 10 mol% in the high-grade epizone and in the mesozone. Higher hydrocarbons and CH4 were the products of kerogen maturation and cracking of preexisting petroleum. Large water supplies originated from the dehydration of cooler metasedimentary rocks that were overthrust by crystalline basements of the Lepontines, Aar, and Gotthard massifs. Carbon isotope analyses suggest that the CO2 Component was derived from oxidation of graphitic matter, especially in the vicinity of sulfate-bearing metasediments and from decarbonation reactions. In the Aar and Gotthard massifs as well as in the Helvetic Axen nappe and its underlying North Helvetic flysch, high fluid pressures prevailed and favored nappe transport. By contrast, in the southern Lepontine area, very low early fluid pressures were probably related to dry rocks and scarce metasediments, and to high geothermal gradients that resulted from intense uplift and erosion between 26 and 18 Ma.Retrograde fluid evolution was recorded by a succession of fluid inclusion populations in each alpine fissure. It was controlled by uplift and cooling and characterized by decreasing contents of volatiles and an increase in deltaO-18 of host quartz. Tectonic activity led to episodic pressure drops of at least 0. 5 to 2 kbar and promoted fluid unmixing, channelized flow, and rapid growth of skeletal quartz. Channelized rather than pervasive fluid migration at temperatures <450-degrees-C and under conditions of brittle deformation is documented by episodic increases in salinity and by fluid flushing through the massifs. There is stable isotope evidence for involvement of meteoric water only in late-crystallizing quartz.Formation of Alpine fissures and fissure minerals was the result of a unique coincidence of late continental collision (<450-degrees-C), fluid expulsion from overthrust metasediments, uplift, and erosion.

XPS measurements demonstrate that O-2 is ten times more effective than CO2 at oxidizing metal Li. Notably, pure N-2 is shown to not dissociate on clean metal Li. UPS results indicate that decomposition of O-2 (CO2) reduces the work function of the Li surface by almost 1 eV, therefore increasing the reduction energy drive for the treated substrate by comparison to bare metallic Li. DFT simulations semiquantitatively account for these results on the basis of the effects of dissociative gas adsorption on the surface dipole density of the Li surface.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000529910700001

Herein, Mo-doped ZnIn2S4 (M-ZIS) flower-like hollow microspheres assembled by ultrathin nanosheets are reported. The as-prepared M-ZIS samples achieve an enhanced H-2 generation rate of 4.62 mmol g(-1) h(-1) under visible light, ten times higher than that of pristine ZIS. The 3D hollow microspheres structure assembled by nanosheets ensures sufficient light harvesting and exposure of more active sites. Meanwhile, the doping of Mo is propitious to regulate the chemical characteristic and electronic structure of ZIS in the merit of ameliorated hydrophilicity, extended light adsorption, accelerated transfer-separation efficiency of charge carriers, as well as the reduced overpotential of H-2 evolution. This model is put forward to obtain an in-depth understanding of the role that both the 3D hollow hierarchical structure and doping atoms play in photocatalytic water splitting.									53	2	0	0	1	0	53			2367-198X			WOS:000500576600001		
J	Liu, Peng; Sun, Changchun; Liu, Guiju; Jiang, Zhan; Zhao, Haiguang								Ultra-small-sized multi-element metal oxide nanofibers: an efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution								NANOSCALE ADVANCES				4	7			1758	1769		10.1039/d2na00100d		FEB 2022		MAR 29 2022	2022	Compared to noble metals, transition metal oxides (TMOs) have positive development prospects in the field of electrocatalysis, and the synergy between the elements in multi-element TMO-based materials can improve their catalytic activity. However, it is still a challenge to synthesize multi-component TMO-based catalysts and deeply understand the effects of components on the catalytic performance of the catalysts. Here, we demonstrate multi-element ultra-small-sized nanofibers for efficient hydrogen production. The ternary NiFeCoO nanofiber-based electrode reached an overpotential of 82 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 56 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH, which are close to those of Pt plate (66 mV at 10 mA cm(-2); the Tafel slope is 32 mV dec(-1)). In addition, the current density maintained 97% of its initial value after 10 h operation. We used the ternary NiFeCoO nanofiber-based electrode as an efficient counter electrode in photoelectrochemical hydrogen production to demonstrate the versatility of these nanofibers.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2516-0230			WOS:000764210500001	36132161

Here we report for the first time the presence of hemocyanins in the diplopod Myriapoda, demonstrating that these proteins are more widespread among the Arthropoda than previously thought. The hemocyanin of Spirostreptus sp, (Diplopoda: Spirostreptidae) is composed of two immunologically distinct subunits in the 75-kDa range that are most likely arranged in a 36-mer (6 x 6) native molecule. It has a high oxygen affinity (P-50 = 4.7 torr) but low cooperativity (h 1.3 +/- 0,2). Spirostreptus hemocyanin is structurally similar to the single known hemocyanin from the myriapod taxon, Scutigera coleoptrata (Chilopoda), indicating a rather conservative architecture of the myriapod hemocyanins. Western blotting demonstrates shared epitopes of Spirostreptus hemocyanin with both chelicerate and crustacean hemocyanins, confirming its identity as an arthropod hemocyanin.									42	0	0	0	38	1	42			0021-9258			WOS:000083017800038	10506159

They introduce an abrupt structural and chemical anisotropy, which is readily reflected in an unusual microstructure evolution, whereas their local structure affects the physical properties of polycrystalline materials. These effects, however, can be exploited to tailor the electronic and optical properties of the materials, as demonstrated in this review. The presented topic is related to a preparatory stage of phase transformations, manifested through the evolution of chemically induced structural faults. In non-centrosymmetric structure of ZnO, inversion boundaries (IBs) are the most common type of planar faults that is triggered by the addition of the specific IB-forming dopants (Sb2O3, SnO2, TiO2). In addition to conventional TEM techniques, new methods were developed to resolve crystallography and atomic-scale chemistry of IBs. The absolute orientation of the polar c-axes on both sides of an IB was determined by micro-diffraction, providing the most reliable identification of crystal polarity in non-centrosymmetric crystals. To determine sub-monolayer quantities of dopants on the IB, we developed a special technique of analytical electron microscopy using concentric electron probe (CEP) in EDS or EELS mode, providing more accurate and precise results than any other technique. Knowing the local crystal chemistry of IBs, we were able to design experiments to identify their formation mechanism. IBs nucleate in the early stage of grain growth as a dopant-rich topotaxial 2D reaction product on Zn-terminated surfaces of ZnO grains. Soon after their nucleation, ZnO is epitaxially grown on the inherent 2D phase in an inverted orientation, which effectively starts to dictate anisotropic growth of the infected crystallite. In very short time, the grains with IBs dominate the entire microstructure via IB-induced exaggerated grain growth mechanism. This phenomenon was used to design physical properties of ZnO-based varistor ceramics, whereas the bottom-up approach demonstrated here provides the basic tool for microstructural engineering of functional materials in virtually any system that is prone to the formation of special boundaries.									28	1	0	0	0	0	29			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000299105200009		
J	Zhi, Lihua; Tu, Jibing; Li, Jiaxuan; Li, Min; Liu, Jiacheng								3D holey hierarchical nanoflowers assembled by cobalt phosphide embedded N-doped carbon nanosheets as bifunctional electrocatalyst for highly efficient overall water splitting								JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE				616				379	388		10.1016/j.jcis.2022.02.066				JUN 15 2022	2022	With the increasing energy and environmental crisis, exploring convenient and general strategies for constructing of highly active, stable, and cost-effective bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting are exceedingly desirable yet still challenging. Herein, 3D hierarchical mesoporous cobalt phosphide embedded N-doped carbon nanoflowers (CoP@NCNFs) are successfully constructed with ultrathin nanosheets by phosphating of the cobalt coordination polymer nanoflowers (CoCPNFs). By virtue of their unique architecture and particular composition, the obtained CoP@NCNFs reveal extraordinary performance with ultralow overpotentials and small Tafel slopes for both OER (291 mV at 10 mA cm(-2); 75 mV dec(-1)) and HER (166 mV at 10 mA cm(-2); 76 mV dec(-1)) in alkaline medium. In particular, CoP@NCNFs can act as both anode and cathode to perform overall water splitting, and the assembled device only needs a cell voltage as low as 1.59 V to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Simultaneously, the CoP@NCNFs also exhibit admirable durability (at least 15 h) throughout the water splitting process. These remarkable electrocatalytic performances could be attributed to the synergistic effect of highly active CoP NPs and conductive mesoporous N-doped carbon nanosheets, which effectively improved the surface contact between catalyst and electrolyte, mass diffusion, and stability.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

J	Fallow, Ashley; Domenech, Pilar; Reed, Michael B.								Strains of the East Asian (W/Beijing) Lineage of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Are DosS/DosT-DosR Two-Component Regulatory System Natural Mutants								JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY				192	8			2228	2238		10.1128/JB.01597-09				APR 15 2010	2010	As part of our ongoing efforts to uncover the phenotypic consequences of genetic variability among clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates, we previously reported that isolates of the "East Asian" or "W/Beijing" lineage constitutively overexpress the coordinately regulated transcriptional program known as the DosR regulon under standard in vitro conditions. This phenotype distinguishes the W/Beijing lineage from all other M. tuberculosis lineages, which normally induce expression of this regulon only once exposed to low oxygen or nitric oxide, both of which result in inhibition of bacterial respiration and replication. Transcription of the DosR regulon is controlled through a two-component regulatory system comprising the transcription factor DosR and two possible cognate histidine sensor kinases, DosS and DosT. Through sequence analysis of a carefully selected set of isolates representing each of the major M. tuberculosis lineages, we describe herein a naturally occurring frameshift mutation in the gene encoding the DosT sensor kinase for isolates of the most recently evolved W/Beijing sublineages. Intriguingly, the occurrence of the frameshift mutation correlates precisely with the appearance of the constitutive DosR regulon phenotype displayed by the same "modern" W/Beijing strains. However, complementation studies have revealed that the mutation in dosT alone is not directly responsible for the constitutive DosR regulon phenotype. Our data serve to highlight the evolutionary pressure that exists among distinct M. tuberculosis lineages to maintain tight control over DosR regulon expression.									40	4	0	0	37	0	44			0021-9193	1098-5530		WOS:000276048300021	20154135

It was found in northern Italy in 2006 and in central Italy in 2008. In this last area it has colonised the recent artificial basin of Bilancino (Mugello Valley, Florence), currently being the only and abundant amphipod species in the lake. This new population offered a good opportunity to study the life cycle and behaviour of such unpopular species (called killer shrimp because of its aggression), with the aim of better understanding the mechanisms of survival and diffusion of water gammarids. For about one year and a half, bimonthly samplings were carried out in different points of the lake to study the life cycle and identify the most suitable populations for behavioural experiments. On this species experiments were carried out in the natural context to verify sun and landscape orientation and in the laboratory to analyse the response to a black boundary, direct light and substrate slope. The populations from the different points had a comparable structure and development, even if subjected to variations linked to the local features of the lake's bottom. The response to the black boundary (simulating a predator or a refuge) was not significant, while a significant reaction of avoidance of a direct artificial light and a significant preference for the basin bottom (downslope) were observed. No specific responses were identified where the behaviour was strictly linked to the environment colonised (orientation to the sun and natural landscape). A lack of fine-tuned adaptations was expected in this species that has colonised a variety of environments, confirming comparable results on the physiology of this species, such as adaptation to wide ranges of temperature, salinity and oxygen levels.

J	Wu, Dun; Zhang, Wenyong					Dun, Wu/0000-0002-4906-8263			Evolution Mechanism of Macromolecular Structure in Coal during Heat Treatment: Based on FTIR and XRD In Situ Analysis Techniques								JOURNAL OF SPECTROSCOPY				2019						5037836	10.1155/2019/5037836				2019	2019	Owing to the complexity and heterogeneity of coal during pyrolysis, the ex situ analytical techniques cannot accurately reflect the real coal pyrolysis process. In this study, according to the joint investigation of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), the structural evolution characteristics of lignite-subbituminous coal-bituminous coal-anthracite series under heat treatment were discussed in depth. The results of the infrared spectrum of coal show that the different functional groups of coal show different changes with the increase of coal rank before pyrolysis experiment. Based on in situ infrared spectroscopy experiments, it was found that the infrared spectrum curves of the same coal sample have obvious changes at different pyrolysis temperatures. As a whole, when the pyrolysis temperature is between 400 and 500 degrees C, the coal structure can be greatly changed. By fitting the infrared spectrum curve, the infrared spectrum parameters of coal were obtained. With the change of temperature, these parameters show regular changes in coal with different ranks. In the XRD study of coal, the absorption intensity of the diffraction peak (002) of coal increases with increasing coal rank. The XRD patterns of coal have different characteristics at different pyrolysis temperatures. Overall, the area of (002) diffraction peak of the same coal sample increases obviously with the increase of temperature. The XRD structural parameter of coal was obtained by using the curve fitting method. The changing process of two parameters (interlayer spacing (d(002)) and stacking height (L-c)) can be divided into two main stages, but the average lateral size (L-a) does not change significantly and remains at the 2.98 +/- 0.09nm. In summary, the above two technologies complement each other in the study of coal structure. The temperature range of both experiments is different, but the XRD parameters of coal with different ranks are reduced within the temperature range of less than 500 degrees C, which reflects that the size of coal-heated aromatic ring lamellae is reduced and the distance between lamellae is also reduced, indicating that the degree of condensation of coal aromatic nuclei may be increased. Correspondingly, the FTIR parameters of coal also reflect that, with increasing temperature, the side chains of coal are constantly cracked, the oxygen-containing functional groups are reduced, and the degree of aromatization of coal may be increased.									9	2	0	0	0	0	10			2314-4920	2314-4939		WOS:000464800400001

This study presents nanostructured iridium nanodendrites (Ir-ND) supported on antimony doped tin oxide (ATO) as efficient and stable water splitting catalysts for PEM electrolyzers. The active Ir-ND structures exhibited superior structural and morphological properties, such as particle size and surface area compared to commercial state-of-art Ir catalysts. Supported on tailored corrosion-stable conductive oxides, the Ir-ND catalysts exhibited a more than 2-fold larger kinetic water splitting activity compared with supported Ir nanoparticles, and a more than 8-fold larger catalytic activity than commercial Ir blacks. In single-cell PEM electrolyzer tests, the Ir-ND/ATO outperformed commercial Ir catalysts more than 2-fold at technological current densities of 1.5 A cm(-2) at a mere 1.80 V cell voltage, while showing excellent durability under constant current conditions. We conclude that Ir-ND/ATO catalysts have the potential to substantially reduce the required noble metal loading, while maintaining their catalytic performance, both in idealized three-electrode set ups and in the real electrolyzer device environments.									241	6	0	0	13	0	244			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000354815600004	28706696

High CO2-concentrations are found to induce large gas-uptake signals. Simultaneous measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence suggest that the uptake signals are correlated with energy-dependent fluorescence quenching. Very similar CO2-concentration dependencies are found in the absence and presence of methylviologen, which is known to catalyze O2-reduction, and in the presence of glyceraldehyde. which blocks Calvin cycle and photorespiration. It is suggested that the CO2-enhanced uptake signal is likely to reflect O2-uptake in the Mehler reaction. However, it is not ruled out that also rapid CO2-solubilisation or CO2-binding caused by light-induced stroma alkalisation are involved. Strong uptake is also induced when the CO2-concentration in the closed photoacoustic chamber increases due to dark-respiration. The consequences of these findings with respect to the interpretation of photoacoustic data (e.g., 'low-light effect') and to the regulatory role of O2-dependent electron flow are discussed.									30	1	0	0	27	0	31			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:A1992HQ98000005	24408062

The question of Ca proximity to the Mn cluster has been investigated by performing Mn X-ray absorption experiments on native samples of photosystem II (PS II) and on samples depleted of Ca and reconstituted by either Ca or Sr. Analysis of X-ray K-edge spectra demonstrates no significant differences in oxidation state or symmetry between Ca- and Sr-reactivated preparations. Differences are observed in the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). The amplitude of a Fourier transform peak due to scatterers at distances greater than 3 Angstrom is larger for samples reactivated with strontium than for calcium-reactivated samples. Taking into account the stoichiometry of Mn and Ca atoms in PS II, and considering physically reasonable structures, curve-fitting analyses of the EXAFS data using FEFF5-calculated parameters favor a model where both manganese and calcium (or strontium) scatterers contribute to the Fourier peak at approximately 3 Angstrom. Other models for the similar to 3 Angstrom peak with multiple Mn-Mn interactions or multiple Mn-Ca(Sr) interactions can also be fit to the data, but are considered less likely, This result provides confirmation for the structural proximity of Ca to the Mn cluster suggested previously [Yachandra, V. K., et al, (1993) Science 260, 675-679]. Possible structural arrangements for a calcium-binding site are discussed.									91	2	1	0	51	0	94			0006-2960			WOS:A1995RT65500024	7662671

However, its utilization is largely hindered by poor cyclability and mechanical rigidity due to the lack of a flexible and durable catalyst electrode. Herein, flexible fiber-shaped Li-CO2 batteries with ultralong cycle-life, high rate capability, and large specific capacity are fabricated, employing bamboo-like N-doped carbon nanotube fiber (B-NCNT) as flexible, durable metal-free catalysts for both CO2 reduction and evolution reactions. Benefiting from high N-doping with abundant pyridinic groups, rich defects, and active sites of the periodic bamboo-like nodes, the fabricated Li-CO2 battery shows outstanding electrochemical performance with high full-discharge capacity of 23328 mAh g(-1), high rate capability with a low potential gap up to 1.96 V at a current density of 1000 mA g(-1), stability over 360 cycles, and good flexibility. Meanwhile, the bifunctional B-NCNT is used as the counter electrode for a fiber-shaped dye-sensitized solar cell to fabricate a self-powered fiber-shaped Li-CO2 battery with overall photochemical-electric energy conversion efficiency of up to 4.6%. Along with a stable voltage output, this design demonstrates great adaptability and application potentiality in wearable electronics with a breath monitor as an example.									88	8	0	0	3	0	92			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000481274800001	31397028

The presence of reactive oxygen species and the near lack of repair mechanisms cause mtDNA to mutate at a faster rate than nuclear DNA, and mtDNA deletions are not uncommon in the tissues of individuals, although germ-line mtDNA is largely lesion-free. Large-scale deletions in mtDNA may disrupt multiple genes, and curiously, some large-scale deletions persist over many generations in a heteroplasmic state. Here we examine the phenotypic effects of one such deletion, uaDf5, in Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans). Our study investigates the phenotypic effects of this 3 kbp deletion.Results: The proportion of uaDf5 chromosomes in worms was highly heritable, although uaDf5 content varied from worm to worm and within tissues of individual worms. We also found an impact of the uaDf5 deletion on metabolism. The deletion significantly reduced egg laying rate, defecation rate, and lifespan. Examination of sperm bearing the uaDf5 deletion revealed that sperm crawled more slowly, both in vitro and in vivo.Conclusion: Worms harboring uaDf5 are at a selective disadvantage compared to worms with wild-type mtDNA. These effects should lead to the rapid extinction of the deleted chromosome, but it persists indefinitely. We discuss both the implications of this phenomenon and the possible causes of a shortened lifespan for uaDf5 mutant worms.									43	0	0	0	43	0	43			1471-2156			WOS:000245800600001	17394659

In addition, the split S-3 Signal could not be generated by illumination at 273 K, Exposure of the 33 kDa protein-less photosystem Il to room light did not lead to any change in the EPR properties of the S-2 state, but the split S-3 State signal at around g = 2 could then be generated, indicating that Ca2+ was released from this preparation during the exposure to light. Treatment of photosystem II lacking the 33 kDa protein with EGTA in the Light led to a modification of the S-2 Stale characterized by a dark-stable multiline EPR signal. Much lower EGTA concentrations were required in order to obtain this modification in the absence of the 33 kDa protein than was required when the 33 kDa protein was present. This indicates that the manganese cluster was more accessible to chelator binding when the 33 kDa protein was absent, When 33 kDa protein-less photosystem II was treated with EGTA in the dark, no modification of the multiline EPR signal of the S-2 State of the manganese cluster occurred, nor was Ca2+ released as monitored by the inability to generate the split S-3 signal, These chelator- and Ca2+-binding properties occurring in PSII lacking the 33 kDa protein are very similar to those observed previously in NaCl-washed. PSII in which the 33 kDa protein is present (reviewed in Boussac & Rutherford, 1994a), It is concluded that the 33 kDa protein has little or no direct role in binding the Ca2+ ion which is required for oxygen evolution.									17	1	0	0	15	0	17			0006-2960			WOS:A1996VH07000021	8810916

Different structural and textural characterizations were applied to the dried, calcined and used gold-iron oxide samples. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) showed high homogeneity in the supported Au nanoparticles. The ex situ and in situ X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) characterization monitored the electronic and short-range local structure of active gold species. The synchrotron-based in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), together with the corresponding temperature-programmed reduction by hydrogen (H2-TPR), indicated a structural evolution of the iron-oxide supports, correlating to their reducibility. An inverse order of catalytic activity between DP (Au/Fe_OH < Au/Fe_O) and CD (Au/Fe_OH > Au/Fe_O) was observed. Effective gold-support interaction results in a high activity for gold nanoparticles, locally generated by the sintering of dispersed Au atoms on the oxide support in the DP synthesis, while a hydroxylated surface favors the reactivity of externally introduced Au nanoparticles on Fe_OH support for the CD approach. This work reveals why differences in the synthetic protocol translate to differences in the catalytic performance of Au/FeOx catalysts with very similar structural characteristics in CO oxidation.									42	5	0	0	4	0	42			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000351061700012	25631762

It reveals that (i) D1-D2-Cyt b(559) complexes either in solubilized form or incorporated into liposomes contain only one type of Cyt b559 with E-m values of 60 +/- 5 and 100 +/- 10 mV, respectively, at pH 6.8; (ii) in oxygen-evolving solubilized PS II core complexes Cyt b559 exists predominantly (>85%) as an LP form with an E-m,E-7 Of 125 +/- 10 mV and a minor fraction with an E-m,E-7 Of -150 +/- 15 mV; (iii) in Oxygen-evolving PS II membrane fragments three different redox forms are discernible with E-m values of 390 +/- 15 mV (HP form), 230 +/- 20 mV (IP form), and 105 +/- 25 mV (LP form) and relative amplitudes of 58, 24, and 18%, respectively, at pH 7.3; (iv) the E-m values are almost pH-independent between pH 6 and 9.5 in all sample types except D1-D2-Cyt b559 complexes incorporated into liposomes with a slope of -29 mV/pH unit, when the pH increases from 6 to 9.5 (IP and LP form in PS II membrane fragments possibly within a restricted range from pH 6.5 to 8); (v) at pH > 8 the HP Cyt b559 progressively converts to the IP form with increasing pH; (vi) the reduced-minus-oxidized optical difference spectra of Cyt b(559) are very similar in the A range of 360-700 nm for all types except for the HP form which exhibits pronounced differences in the Sorer band; and (vii) PS II membrane fragments and core complexes are inferred to contain about two Cyt b559 hemes per PS ii.

In this study, 10 CsSOD genes were identified in tea plant genome, including 7 Cu/Zn-SODs (CSDs), 2 Fe-SODs (FSDs) and one Mn-SOD (MSD), and phylogenetically classified in three subgroups, respectively. Physico-chemical characteristic, conserved motifs and potential protein interaction analyses about CsSOD proteins were carried out. Exon-intron structures and codon usage bias about CsSOD genes were also examined. Exon-intron structures analysis revealed that different CsSOD genes contained various number of introns. On the basis of the prediction of regulatory miRNAs of CsSODs, a modification 5' RNA ligase-mediated (RLM)-RACE was performed and validated that csnmiR398a-3p-1 directly cleaves CsCSD4. By prediction of cis-acting elements, the expression patterns of 10 CsSOD genes and their regulatory miRNAs were detected under cold, drought, exogenous methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and gibberellin (GA(3)) treatments. The results showed that most of CsSODs except for CsFSD2 were induced under cold stress and CsCSDs may play primary roles under drought stress; exogenous GA(3) and MeJA could also stimulated/inhibited distinct CsSODs at different stages. In addition, we found that csnmiR398a-3p-1 negatively regulated the expression of CsCSD4 may be a crucial regulatory mechanism under cold stress. This study provides a certain basis for the studies about stress resistance in tea plants, even provide insight into comprehending the classification, evolution, diverse functions and influencing factors of expression patterns for CsSOD genes.									28	6	0	0	23	0	35			1932-6203			WOS:000532467000094	31600284

Tomato plants originated in the tropics and, thus, are cold sensitive. Results Here, we generatedLeGPA1overexpressing and RNA-interference (RNAi) transgenic tomato plants, which we then used to investigate the function ofLeGPA1in response to cold stress. Functional LeGPA1 was detected at the plasma membrane, and endogenousLeGPA1was highly expressed in the roots and leaves. Cold treatment positively induced the expression ofLeGPA1. Overexpression ofLeGPA1conferred tolerance to cold conditions and regulated the expression of genes related to the INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION-C-REPEAT-BINDING FACTOR (ICE-CBF) pathway in tomato plants. In theLeGPA1-overexpressing transgenic plants, the superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase activities and soluble sugar and proline contents were increased, and the production of reactive oxygen species and membrane lipid peroxidation decreased under cold stress. Conclusions Our findings suggest that improvements in antioxidant systems can help plants cope with the oxidative damage caused by cold stress, thereby stabilizing cell membrane structures and increasing the rate of photosynthesis. The data presented here provide evidence for the key role ofLeGPA1in mediating cold signal transduction in plant cells. These findings extend our knowledge of the roles of G-proteins in plants and help to clarify the mechanisms through which growth and development are regulated in processing tomato plants.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5			1471-2229			WOS:000566919600003	32847511	
J	Reardon, Eric J.; Fagan, Randal; Vogan, John L.; Przepiora, Andrzej								Anaerobic corrosion reaction kinetics of nanosized iron								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				42	7			2420	2425		10.1021/es0712120				APR 1 2008	2008	Nanosized Fe-0 exhibits markedly different anaerobic corrosion rates in water compared to that disseminated in moist quartz sand. In water, hydrogen production from corrosion exhibits an autocatalytic style, attaining a maximum rate of 1.9 mol kg(-1) d(-1) within 2 d of reaction. The rate then drops sharply over the next 20 d and enters a period of uniformly decreasing rate, represented equally well by first-order or diffusion-controlled kinetic expressions. In quartz sand, hydrogen production exhibits a double maximum over the first 20 d, similar to the hydration reaction of Portland cement, and the highest rate attained is less than 0.5 mol kg(-1) d(-1). We ascribe this difference in early time corrosion behavior to the ability of the released hydrogen gas to convect both water and iron particles in an iron/water system and to its inability to do so when the iron particles are disseminated in sand. By 30 d, the hydrogen production rate of iron in quartz sand exhibits a uniform decrease as in the iron/water system, which also can be described by first-order or diffusion-controlled kinetic expressions. However, the corrosion resistance of the iron in moist sand is 4 times greater than in pure water (Viz. t(1/2) of 365 d vs 78 d, respectively). The lower rate for iron in sand is likely due to the effect of dissolved silica sorbing onto iron reaction sites and acting as an anodic inhibitor, which reduces the iron's susceptibility to oxidation by water. This study indicates that short-term laboratory corrosion tests of nanosized Fe-0/ water slurries will substantially underestimate both the material's longevity as an electron source and its potential as a longterm source of hydrogen gas in groundwater remediation applications.									54	5	0	0	29	0	58			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000254492800035	18504975

Tolerance for high bacterial counts and maintenance of microbiota homeostasis remain insufficiently studied. In this study, we identified a novel dual oxidase (MjDUOX2) involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus. MjDUOX2 is a transmembrane protein with an N-signal peptide region (19 aa) and a peroxidase homology domain (PHD, 554 aa) in the extracellular region; seven trans membrane regions; and three EF (calcium-binding region) domains (110 aa), a FAD-binding domain (104 aa), and a NAD-binding domain (156 aa) in the intracellular region. The novel MjDUOX2 exhibits a relatively low similarity (26.84% identity) to a previously reported DUOX in the shrimp (designated as MjDUOX1). The mRNA of MjDUOXs was widely distributed in the hemocytes, heart, hepatopancreas, gills, stomach, and intestine. Oral infection of the shrimp with pathogenic bacteria upregulated the mRNA expression of MjDUOXs and increased the ROS level in the intestine. However, High ROS level could inhibit the expression of MjDUOXs in shrimp after Vibrio anguillarum infection. Knockdown of MjDUOXs by RNA interference (RNAi) decreased the ROS level, increased the bacterial count in the intestine, and decreased the survival rate of the MjDUOX-RNAi shrimp infected with V. anguillarum. These results suggest that MjDUOXs play an important role for microbiota homeostasis in intestine of shrimp. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

PCC 6803, in which the CP47 polypeptide has been genetically engineered to contain a polyhistidine tag at its carboxyl terminus [Bricker, T. M., Morvant, J., Masri, N., Sutton, H. M., and Frankel, L. K. (1998) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1409, 50-57]. These purified PSII centers had four manganese atoms, one calcium atom, and two cytochrome b(559) hemes each. Optical absorption and fluorescence emission spectroscopy as well as western immunoblot analysis demonstrated that the purified PSII preparation was devoid of any contamination with photosystem I and phycobiliproteins. A comprehensive proteomic analysis using a system designed to enhance resolution of low-molecular-weight polypeptides, followed by MALDI mass spectrometry and N-terminal amino acid sequencing, identified 31 distinct polypeptides in this PSII preparation. We propose a new nomenclature for the polypeptide components of PSII identified after PsbZ, which proceeds sequentially from Psb27. During this study, the polypeptides PsbJ, PsbM, PsbX, PsbY, PsbZ, Psb27, and Psb28 proteins were detected for the first time in a purified PSII complex from Synechocystis 6803. Five novel polypeptides were also identified in this preparation. They included the SH1638 protein, which shares significant sequence similarity to PsbQ, a peripheral protein of PSII that was previously thought to be present only in chloroplasts. This work describes newly identified proteins in a highly purified cyanobacterial PSII preparation that is being widely used to investigate the structure, function, and biogenesis of this photosystem.									275	9	1	0	271	1	308			0006-2960			WOS:000176324000018	12069591	
J	Charnley, SB; Rodgers, SD; Ehrenfreund, P				Charnley, Steven B/C-9538-2012				Gas-grain chemical models of star-forming molecular clouds as constrained by ISO and SWAS observations								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				378	3			1024	1036		10.1051/0004-6361:20011193				NOV 2001	2001	We have investigated the gaseous and solid state molecular composition of dense interstellar material that periodically experiences processing in the shock waves associated with ongoing star formation. Our motivation is to confront these models with the stringent abundance constraints on CO2, H2O and O-2, in both gas and solid phases, that have been set by ISO and SWAS. We also compare our results with the chemical composition of dark molecular clouds as determined by ground-based telescopes. Beginning with the simplest possible model needed to study molecular cloud gas-grain chemistry, we only include additional processes where they are clearly required to satisfy one or more of the ISO-SWAS constraints. When CO, N-2 and atoms of N, C and S are efficiently desorbed from grains, a chemical quasi-steady-state develops after about one million years. We find that accretion of CO2 and H2O cannot explain the [CO2/H2O](ice) ISO observations; as with previous models, accretion and reaction of oxygen atoms are necessary although a high O atom abundance can still be derived from the CO that remains in the gas. The observational constraints on solid and gaseous molecular oxygen are both met in this model. However, we find that we cannot explain the lowest H2O abundances seen by SWAS or the highest atomic carbon abundances found in molecular clouds; additional chemical processes are required and possible candidates are given. One prediction of models of this type is that there should be some regions of molecular clouds which contain high gas phase abundances of H2O, O-2 and NO. A further consequence, we find, is that interstellar grain mantles could be rich in NH2OH and NO2. The search for these regions, as well as NH2OH and NO2 in ices and in hot cores, is an important further test of this scenario. The model can give good agreement with observations of simple molecules in dark molecular clouds such as TMC-1 and L134N. Despite the fact that S atoms are assumed to be continously desorbed from grain surfaces, we find that the sulphur chemistry independently experiences an "accretion catastrophe". The S-bearing molecular abundances cease to lie within the observed range after about 3 x 10(6) years and this indicates that there may be at least two efficient surface desorption mechanisms operating in dark clouds - one quasi-continous and the other operating more sporadically on this time-scale. We suggest that mantle removal on short time-scales is mediated by clump dynamics, and by the effects of star formation on longer time-scales. The applicability of this type of dynamical-chemical model for molecular cloud evolution is discussed and comparison is made with other models of dark cloud chemistry.									92	2	0	0	4	0	92			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000171897200030

The gene encoding the enzyme has been isolated. From its cDNA sequence the amino acid sequence has been derived and shown to have high similarity with those of other enzymes catalyzing oxidation of L-alpha-hydroxy acids, including flavocytochrome b(2), lactate monooxygenase, glycolate oxidase, mandelate dehydrogenases and a long chain alpha-hydroxy acid oxidase. The enzyme is expressed in Escherichia coli, and is a flavoprotein containing FMN as prosthetic group. It shares many properties of other alpha-hydroxy acid oxidizing enzymes, eg stabilization of the anionic semiquinone form of the flavin, facile formation of flavin-N(5)-sulfite adducts and a set of conserved amino acid residues around the bound flavin. Steady-state- and rapid reaction kinetics of the enzyme have been studied and found to share many characteristics with those of L-lactate monooxygenase, but to differ from the latter in quantitative aspects. It is these quantitative differences between the two enzymes which account for the differences in the overall reactions catalyzed. These differences arise from different stabilities of a common intermediate of reduced flavin enzyme and pyruvate. In the case of the monooxygenase this complex is very stable, and is the form that reacts with O-2 to give a complex in which the oxidative decarboxylation occurs, yielding the products, acetate, CO2, and H2O (Lockridge O, Massey V, Sullivan PA (1972) J Biol Chem 247, 8097-8106). With lactate oxidase, the complex dissociates rapidly, with the result that it is the free reduced flavin form of the enzyme that reacts with O-2, to give the observed products, pyruvate and H2O2.									114	2	1	0	92	0	117			0300-9084			WOS:A1995TA98300015	8589073

In isolated spinach thylakoids and Synechocystis 6803 cells, in which de novo protein synthesis is blocked by lincomycin, photodamage of Photosystem II by visible and UV-B light is characterized by linear semilogarithmic inactivation curves for both separate and combined illumination protocols. The extent of PS II inactivation obtained after combined illumination can be well simulated by assuming independent damaging events induced by visible and UV-B photons. In intact Synechocystis cells capable of protein repair, simultaneous illumination by visible and UV-B light impairs Photosystem II activity to a smaller extent than expected from the independent damaging events. This protective effect is pronounced at low visible light (130 muE m(-2) s(-1)), but becomes negligible at high intensities (1300 muE m(-2) s(-1)). Exposure of intact Synechocystis 6803 cells to direct sunlight leads to a rapid inactivation of PS II, accompanied by the accumulation of donor side inhibited centers. This phenomenon, which shows the impairment of the manganese cluster of water oxidation was not observed when the ultraviolet components of sunlight were filtered out. We conclude that visible and UV-B photons inactivate PS II via non-interacting mechanisms, which affect different target sites. In intact cells, the two spectral regions do interact, and results in synergistically enhanced protein repair capacity when UV-B radiation is accompanied by low intensity visible light, which provides protection against photodamage. However, this ameliorating effect becomes insignificant at high light intensities characteristic of direct sunlight.									58	6	0	0	55	0	66			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000181506700003	16245083

Among the study sites, the KD, LG, and CBS volcanic fields are located on the northeastern margin of the North China Craton (NCC), whereas the WQ and JL fields lie on the southern margin of the Xing'an-Mongolia Orogenic Belt (XMOB). The (Fo) components of olivine (Ol) and Cr# (=Cr/(Cr + Al)) of spinel, together with trace element abundance of clinopyroxene, suggest that the subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) in the study area has undergone a low degree (4-6%) of partial melting. The rocks do not show modal metasomatism, but clinopyroxene grains in selected samples show elevated large ion lithophile element compositions, suggesting that the mantle xenoliths underwent minor cryptic metasomatism by exchange with a silicate melt. Two-pyroxene thermometry yielded equilibration temperatures ranging from 740 degrees C to 1210 degrees C. The corresponding oxygen fugacity (fO(2)) was calculated to range from FMQ -2.64 to +0.39 with an average of -0.59 (n=53). The oxidation state is comparable to that of abyssal peridotites and the asthenospheric mantle. We failed to discover differences in equilibration temperatures and oxidation state between lherzolites and harzburgites, suggesting that partial melting did not affect fO(2) values. In addition, similar fO(2) of non-metasomatized and metasomatized samples suggest that metasomatism in the region did not affect fO(2). Our data suggest that the present SCLM beneath the northeastern margin of the NCC and the southern margin of the XMOB are very similar and likely formed from a fertile asthenosphere after delamination of an old lithospheric keel below the NCC in response to the west-dipping subduction of the Pacific oceanic plate since early to middle Mesozoic time.									11	7	0	0	1	0	13			0020-6814	1938-2839		WOS:000321608100005

Herein, we design and successfully synthesize 2D MOF-derived leaf-like structured Co4S3 decorated with CdS photocatalyst by a facile method, which possesses a lateral size of 3-6 mu m with the thickness of 130-160 nm. The maximum optical absorption wavelength of Co4S3/CdS extends remarkably from 570 nm to 720 nm in visible light region compared with pure CdS nanospheres, demonstrating that the Co4S3/CdS hybrid material has higher solar energy utilization efficiency. Benefited from the structural advantages and the improvement of the absorption region, the optimized Co4S3/CdS (0.2) exhibits superior hydrogen production performance, and the amount of H-2 reaches 5892.6 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) under continuous visible-light illumination. Notably, the result manifests over 6 times greater than the neat CdS nanoparticles. Above all, this work provides a remarkable stepping stone in rationally constructing 2D MOF-based composite materials for sustainable energy sources applied in the field of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

Synthesization of the composite materials was followed by two step simple hydrothermal method. Initially, a ternary composite consisting of Nb2O5, MoS2 and graphene was prepared by hydrothermal method. For further improvement in the hydrogen evolution rate and photocatalytic efficiency, the ternary composite Nb2O5/MoS2/Graphene (NMG) was combined hydrothermally with different metal oxides (TiO2, ZnO, Cu2O, CdO, NiO and MgO). Purposive characterization of the synthesized materials were accomplished by XRD, SEM, TEM, FTIR, PL and UV-DRS techniques to analyze their physical and chemical properties. The crystallite sizes were estimated from XRD and found to vary in the range 10.69-47.8 nm. Particle sizes from SEM were found in the range 41-98 nm. FTIR spectra confirms the bands representing Nb-O-Nb and Nb=O stretching. The band gaps of composites (NMG/metal oxides) were examined in the range of 2.40-3.08ev. Room temperature dielectric behaviors of the synthesized nanocomposites were observed and found a decreasing behavior in dielectric constant and dielectric loss with increasing frequency. Conclusive outcomes of synthesized samples exhibited improved photocatalytic activity in terms of degradation of methyl orange and hydrogen evolution from water splitting.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000493217800097		
J	Mashonkina, L; Gehren, T; Travaglio, C; Borkova, T				Mashonkina, Lyudmila/AAZ-9318-2020				Mg, Ba and Eu abundances in thick disk and halo stars								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				397	1			275	284		10.1051/0004-6361:20021512				JAN 2003	2003	Our sample of cool dwarf stars from previous papers (Mashonkina & Gehren 2000, 2001) is extended in this study including 15 moderately metal-deficient stars. The samples of halo and thick disk stars have overlapping metallicities with [Fe/H] in the region from -0.9 to -1.5, and we compare chemical properties of these two kinematically different stellar populations independent of their metallicity. We present barium, europium and magnesium abundances for the new sample of stars. The results are based on NLTE line formation obtained in differential model atmosphere analyses of high resolution spectra observed mainly using the UVES spectrograph at the VLT of the European Southern Observatory. We confirm the overabundance of Eu relative to Mg in halo stars as reported in our previous papers. Eight halo stars show [Eu/Mg] values between 0:23 and 0:41, whereas stars in the thick and thin disk display a solar europium to magnesium ratio. The [Eu/Ba] values found in the thick disk stars to lie between 0:35 and 0:57 suggest that during thick disk formation evolved low-mass stars started to enrich the interstellar gas by s-nuclei of Ba, and the s-process contribution to barium thus varies from 30% to 50%. Based on these results, and using the chemical evolution calculations by Travaglio et al. (1999), we estimate that the thick disk stellar population formed on a timescale between 1.1 to 1.6 Gyr from the beginning of the protogalactic collapse. In the halo stars the [Eu/Ba] values are found mostly between 0:40 and 0:67, which suggests a duration of the halo formation of about 1.5 Gyr. For the whole sample of stars we present the even-to-odd Ba isotope ratios as determined from hyperfine structure seen in the Ba II resonance line lambda 4554. As expected, the solar ratio 82:18 (Cameron 1982) adjusts to observations of the Ba II lines in the thin disk stars. In our halo stars the even-to-odd Ba isotope ratios are close to the pure r-process ratio 54:46 (Arlandini et al. 1999), and in the thick disk stars the isotope ratio is around 65:35 (+/-10%). Based on these data we deduce for thick disk stars the ratio of the s/r-process contribution to barium as 30:70 (+/-30%), in agreement with the results obtained from the [Eu/Ba] values.									84	2	2	0	0	0	87			0004-6361			WOS:000179768500028

In this work, CN is covalently wrapped by a 2D Schiff-base covalent organic framework (COF, denoted as TMP), which is composed of 2,4,6-tris(4-aminophenyl)-1,3,5-triazine (TAPT), melem and 1,3,5-triformyl phloroglucinol (TP), by means of "one-pot " solvothermal method with a cocoon-like morphology presented (CN/TMP). Given the significant distinction of charge densities between the two constituent units, viz., melem and TAPT, the resultant acceleration of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) within the TMP shroud endows the formed integrate with a significantly raised charge delivery and lowered band gap energy (E-g) in comparison to a structure-analogous COF (TM) incorporated hybrid, CN/TM, in which the TAPT monomer is not involved in the TM COF construction. The photocatalytic water-splitting evaluation indicates CN/TMP conducted photocatalysis could provide the hydrogen (H-2) production of 102.88 mu mol.h(-1), about 5.6 and 11.6 times greater than that of CN/TM and CN, respectively. Our modulation strategy at molecular level proffers a new opportunity for the construction of the carbon nitride based hybrids and the regulation in their photoelectric behaviors.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000815993800002

This methodology is based on the multistate continuum theory with an arbitrary number of diabatic electronic states representing the relevant charge distributions in a general PCET system. The active electrons and transferring proton(s) are treated quantum mechanically, and the electron-proton vibronic free energy surfaces are represented as functions of multiple scalar solvent coordinates corresponding to the single electron and proton transfer reactions involved in the PCET process. A dynamical formulation of the dielectric continuum theory is used to derive a set of coupled generalized Langevin equations of motion describing the time evolution of these collective solvent coordinates. The parameters in the Langevin equations depend on the solvent properties, such as the dielectric constants, relaxation time, and molecular moment of inertia, as well as the solute properties. The dynamics of selected intramolecular nuclear coordinates, such as the proton donor-acceptor distance or a torsional angle within the PCET complex, may also be included in this formulation. A surface hopping method in conjunction with the Langevin equations of motion is used to simulate the nonadiabatic dynamics on the multidimensional electron-proton vibronic free energy surfaces following photoexcitation. This theoretical treatment enables the description of both sequential and concerted mechanisms, as well as more complex processes involving a combination of these mechanisms. The application of this methodology to a series of model systems corresponding to collinear and orthogonal PCET illustrates fundamental aspects of these different mechanisms and elucidates the significance of proton vibrational relaxation and nonequilibrium solvent dynamics.

However, it is challenging to prepare such materials as efficient photocatalysts because Nb5+ species are readily reduced during synthesis, and the energy offsets between the band edges of such materials and the water redox potentials are small. In this study, a series of LaMgxNb1-xO1+3xN2-3x solid solutions (0.0 <= x <= 0.5) was synthesized in an attempt to modify the band structures and improve the water splitting activity of these compounds. The substitution of Mg2+ enlarged the band gap of LaNbON2, shifting the conduction and valence band edges negatively and positively, respectively, while retaining visible light absorption up to 600 nm and beyond. Moreover, the concentrations of reduced Nb species at the oxynitride surfaces generated during nitridation were significantly decreased with increasing Mg2+ content. As a result, increasing the amount of Mg2+ in these materials enhanced their photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity. Moreover, the co-loading of RhCrOy and CoOz as cocatalysts for water reduction and oxidation, respectively, allowed LaMgxNb1-xO1+3xN2-3x (0.2 <= x <= 0.5) to simultaneously evolve gaseous H-2 and O-2 from water under visible light (lambda > 420 nm). These observations demonstrate the effectiveness of this band engineering technique and the necessity for further refinements of material properties and surface modifications to realize visible-light-driven overall water splitting over Nb-based oxynitrides.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000637555800045

Highly efficient multifunctional electrodes based on bimetallic sulfides for rechargeable batteries are extremely desirable but still challenging to tailor with controllable phase and structure. Here, we report a colloidal strategy to fabricate FeCo-based bimetallic sulfides on reduced graphene oxide (rGO), which are expected to display highly efficient oxygen electrocatalysis and sodium storage performances. Specifically, as-screened FeCo8S8 nanosheets (NSs) on rGO originating from suitable tailoring of the Co9S8 matrix with Fe at the atomic level exhibited a very low potential difference (0.77 V) at 10 mA cm(-2) and negligible voltage loss after 200 cycles as an air electrode for Zn -air batteries. For Na-ion batteries, FeCo8S8 NS/rGO demonstrated a superior high-rate capability (188 mAh g(-1) at 20 A g(-1)) with long-term cycling stability. The bifunctional electrocatalytic property and sodium storage performance are attributed to not only the synergistic effect of Fe/Co but also the optimized catalytic activity and ion transport ability by the in situ rGO hybrid. This work demonstrates the potential applications of FeCo-based bimetallic sulfides as efficient electrode materials for both rechargeable Zn-air and Na-ion batteries.									26	1	0	0	0	0	26			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000566341000104	32701259

Herein, we report an earth-abundant alloy catalyst, Cu-doped Ni nanotubes (NiCu NTs), through a simple electrodeposition-dealloying route, which acts as a competent catalyst for the electrocatalytic oxidation (ECO) of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) at the anode and simultaneous cathodic H-2 evolution. The cell potential required to deliver a benchmark current density of 100 mA cm(-2) is greatly decreased by 350 mV with respect to the conventional overall water splitting, demonstrating a better energy consumption efficiency. When being employed as an anodic catalyst, the NiCu NTs catalyst enables similar to 100% conversion of HMF and similar to 99% yield of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) with 20 mM HMF in 1.0 M KOH, and a good-to-excellent product yield can be obtained at an increased HMF concentration from 35 to 100 mM. The potential-dependent Raman results reveal that the electrogenerated Ni3+OOH species are the intermediates to promote HMF oxidation. Moreover, the catalyst also delivers almost similar to 100% conversion and selectivity to the corresponding acid products when extending the organic substrates to other small alcohols/aldehydes, demonstrating its splendid versatility.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000781517600001

The powders were pressed and sintered under different pressures, heating rates and holding times. The later grinding and polishing surface treatments were characterized by infinite focus microscope. The wetting experiments were carried out under pure Ar atmosphere. A small piece of Armco Fe and steel grade was melted on sintered nano oxides, heating up to 1600 degrees C with a holding time of 10 minutes for each experiment. The contact angles were measured and chemical analyses were conducted on tested samples to characterize the wetting reactions. It was found that sintered nano TiO2 not only suffered considerable wetting by Armco Fe and 22CrNiMoV5-3 steel in both cases, but also reacted with the substrate to form ilmenite and pseudo-brookite. The CeO2 substrate and Armco Fe system also showed good wetting behavior. In general terms, it was concluded that wettability was affected by substrate chemical composition, and surface characteristics by sintering conditions. The preliminary results of this investigation may help to determine the suitability of the nanoparticle to be added in a liquid iron based matrix in order to influence the microstructure evolution improving mechanical properties by a fine distribution in the metallic alloy.									8	2	0	0	0	0	10			0915-1559	1347-5460		WOS:000291084500008

This study demonstrates a novel ternary electrocatalyst of porous cobalt phosphoselenide nanosheets prepared by a combined hydrogenation and phosphation strategy. Benefiting from the enhanced electric conductivity and large surface area, the ternary nanosheets supported on electrochemically exfoliated graphene electrodes exhibit excellent catalytic activity and durability toward hydrogen evolution in alkali, achieving current densities of 10 and 20 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 150 and 180 mV, respectively, outperforming those reported for transition metal dichalcogenides and first-row transition metal pyrites catalysts. Theoretical calculations reveal that the synergistic effects of Se vacancies and subsequent P displacements of Se atoms around the vacancies in the resulting cobalt phosphoselenide favorably change the electronic structure of cobalt selenide, assuring a rapid charge transfer and optimal energy barrier of hydrogen desorption, and thus promoting the proton kinetics. The overall-water-splitting with 10 mA cm(-2) at a low voltage of 1.64 V is achieved using the ternary electrode as both the anode and cathode, and the performance surpasses that of the Ir/C-Pt/C couple for sufficiently high overpotentials. Moreover, the integration of ternary nanosheets with macroporous silicon enables highly efficient solar-driven photoelectrochemical hydrogen production.									190	14	0	0	11	0	191			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000410762400014	28714078

A vast array of theoretical and computational methods PT have been developed to study electrochemical PCET. These methods can be used to calculate redox potentials and pK, values for molecular electrocatalysts, proton-coupled redox potentials and bond dissociation free energies for PCET at metal and semiconductor interfaces, and reorganization energies associated with electrochemical PCET. Periodic density functional theory can also be used to compute PCET activation energies and PT perform molecular dynamics simulations of electrochemical interfaces. Various approaches for maintaining a constant electrode potential in electronic structure calculations and modeling complex interactions in the electric double layer (EDL) have been developed. Theoretical formulations for both homogeneous and heterogeneous electrochemical PCET spanning the adiabatic, nonadiabatic, and solvent-controlled regimes have been developed and provide analytical expressions for the rate constants and current densities as functions of applied potential. The quantum mechanical treatment of the proton and inclusion of excited vibronic states have been shown to be critical for describing experimental data, such as Tafel slopes and potential-dependent kinetic isotope effects. The calculated rate constants can be used as input to microkinetic models and voltammogram simulations to elucidate complex electrocatalytic processes.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000815214600001	35230812

Propane/air mixtures are ignited in the center of the visualized chamber and the subsequent flame front evolution process is recorded. The effects of the gap size of the chamber and the initial pressure of the mixture on the flame behaviors are investigated. In the condition of the gap size H = 0.45 mm, the flammable range of propane/air mixtures ranges from 2.0 bar to 3.0 bar of initial pressure P-0, and from 0.9 to 1.5 of the equivalence ratio phi. At H = 0.45 mm, the flammability limit of the mixture is lower than that of large scale, and the instability of flame propagation is higher. With suitable initial conditions, such as P-0 >= 2.5 bar, phi = 1.2 similar to 1.3, and H = 0.45 mm, the transition from a low-speed laminar flame to a high-speed deflagration flame is observed. When the size of the combustion chamber height is as small as the laminar flame surface thickness, acoustic waves in the combustion chamber dominate flame propagation. The interaction between the acoustic wave and the flame front greatly increases the flame surface area, resulting in great enhancement of reaction and subsequent flame deflagration. Furthermore, the increase in initial pressure will dramatically increase the propagation speed and the pressure peak, which are also affected notably by the equivalence ratio and the spatial scale of the chamber.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0010-2202	1563-521X		WOS:000507819900001

Here we present the first attempt to globally investigate how the dust impact transfers from the neutral upper atmosphere to the ionosphere and the induced magnetosphere above 100-km altitude. This is achieved by running a multifluid magnetohydrodynamic model under nondusty and dusty atmospheric conditions for the 2017 late-winter regional storm and the 1971-1972 global storm. Our results show that the dayside main ionospheric layer (below similar to 250-km altitude) undergoes an overall upwelling, where photochemical reactions dominate. The peak electron density remains unchanged, and the peak altitude shift is in accordance with the upper atmospheric expansion (similar to 5 and similar to 15 km for the regional and global storms, respectively). Controlled by the day-to-night transport, the nightside ionosphere responds to the dust storms in a close connection with what happens on the dayside but not apparently with the ambient atmospheric change. At higher altitudes, dust-induced perturbations propagate upward from the ionosphere to the magnetosphere and extend from the dayside to the nightside, within a broad region bounded by the induced magnetospheric boundary. It is found that the global dust storm is able to dramatically enhance the CO2+ loss by a factor of similar to 3, which amounts to an increase of similar to 20% or more for total carbon loss (in the forms of neutrals and ions). Strong dust storms are a potentially important factor in atmospheric evolution at Mars.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000535389600001

The WO3 center dot H2O/Pd/ CdS ternary heterostructures exhibited remarkably enhanced photocatalysis towards the oxidative coupling of benzylamines to imines, compared with the other photocatalysts of WO3 center dot H2O, CdS, WO3 center dot H2O/CdS, WO3 center dot H2O/Pd, and WO3 center dot H2O/CdS/Pd. The wavelength-dependent photocatalysis of WO3 center dot H2O/Pd/ CdS is in good agreement with its light-harvesting intensity at the corresponding wavelengths. The photoelectrochemical results reflected the enhanced charge carrier separation in WO3 center dot H2O/Pd/CdS, and the photocatalytic H-2 evolution confirmed the highly efficient Z-scheme charge transfer in this ternary photocatalyst. Therefore, the WO3 center dot H2O/Pd/CdS ternary heterostructures possess distinct advantages of extended light harvesting region, spatial separation of electron and holes, and elevated redox power, which synergistically contribute to the superior photocatalysis. The Pd NPs sandwiched between WO3 center dot H2O and CdS acted as not only an electron mediator to facilitate the interfacial charge separation but also a cocatalyst to accelerate the selective oxidation of benzylamine. This work demonstrates a rational design of highly efficient Z-scheme photocatalysts and presents some revelations about the photocatalytic mechanism for selective organic transformations.

We have proposed that both pathways involve concerted addition of H and OH fragments derived from H2O to the complexes in their four-electron-oxidized states, i.e., [L2RuV(O)](2)O4+, ultimately generating bound peroxy intermediates that decay with the evolution Of O-2. The pathways differ primarily in the site of addition of the OH fragment, which is either a ruthenyl 0 atom or a bipyridine ligand. In the former case, water addition is thought to give rise to a critical intermediate whose structure is L2RuIV(OH)ORuIV(OOH)L-2(4+); the structures of intermediates involved in the other pathway are less well defined but may involve bipyridine OH adducts of the type L2RuV(O)ORuIV(OH)(L center dot OH)L4+, which could react further to generate unstable dioxetanes or similar endoperoxides. Published experimental and theoretical support for these pathways is reviewed within the broader context of water oxidation catalysis and related reactions reported for other diruthenium and group 8 monomeric diimine-based catalysts. New experiments that are designed to probe the issue of bipyridine ligand "noninnocence" in catalysis are described. Specifically, the relative contributions of the two pathways have been shown to correlate with substituent effects in 4,4'- and 5,5'-substituted bipyridine complexes in a manner consistent with the formation of a reactive OH-adduct intermediate in one of the pathways, and the formation of OH-bipyridine adducts during catalytic turnover has been directly confirmed by optical spectroscopy. Finally, a photosensitized system for catalyzed water oxidation has been developed that allows assessment of the catalytic efficiencies of the complex ions under neutral and alkaline conditions; these studies show that the ions are far better catalysts than had previously been assumed based upon reported catalytic parameters obtained with strong oxidants in acidic media.									115	1	0	0	11	0	116			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000253918000005	18330967

Along this line, we report an unconventional face-centered cubic (fcc) Ru with twinned structure and stacking-fault defects as a competent electrocatalyst towards alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), which is now a major obstacle for the commercialization of anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFC). With conventional hexagonal close packing (hcp) Ru as the counterpart, a novel scope from the phase-engineering is introduced to identify the activity origin and provide fundamental understanding of the sluggish HOR kinetics in alkaline medium. Systematic electrochemical analysis assisted by deconvoluting the hydrogen (H) desorption peaks indicates the superior performance of fcc Ru origins from the structure defects and higher proportion of the most active sites. DFT calculations, together with CO-stripping voltammograms further corroborate the stronger hydroxyl species (OH*) affinity lead to the higher activity on these sites. Meanwhile, it also demonstrates the H* adsorption/desorption on polycrystalline Ru among the conventional "hydrogen region" is accompanied by the surface bound OH* in alkaline medium, which is of great significance for subsequent alkaline HOR exploration and catalyst design.(c) 2020 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The approximations underlying each expression are enumerated, and the regimes of validity for each expression are illustrated by calculations oil model systems. In addition, the kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) for a series of model PCET reactions are analyzed to elucidate the fundamental physical principles dictating the magnitude of the KIE and the dependence of the KIE on the physical properties of the system, including temperature, reorganization energy, driving force, equilibrium proton donor-acceptor distance, and effective frequency of the proton donor-acceptor mode. These calculations lead to three physical insights that are directly relevant to experimental data. First, these calculations provide an explanation for a decrease in the KIE as the proton donor-acceptor distance increases, even though typically the KIE will increase with increasing equilibrium proton donor-acceptor distance if all other parameters remain fixed. Often the proton donor-acceptor frequency decreases as the proton donor-acceptor distance increases, and these two effects impact the KIE in opposite directions, so either trend could be observed. Second, these calculations provide an explanation for an increase in the KIE as the temperature increases, even though typically the KIE will decrease with increasing temperature if all other parameters remain fixed. The combination of a rigid hydrogen bond, which corresponds to a high proton donor-acceptor frequency, and low solvent polarity, which corresponds to small solvent reorganization energy, allows the KIE to either increase or decrease with temperature, depending on the other properties of the system. Third, these calculations provide insight into the dependence of the rate constant and KIE on the driving force, which has been studied experimentally for a wide range of PCET systems. The rate constant increases as the driving force becomes more negative because excited vibronic product states associated with low free energy barriers and relatively large vibronic couplings become accessible. The In[KIE] has a maximum near zero driving force and decreases significantly as the driving force becomes more positive or negative because the contributions from excited vibronic states increase as the reaction becomes more asymmetric, and contributions from excited vibronic states decrease the KIE. These calculations and analyses lead to experimentally testable predictions of trends in the KIEs for PCET systems.									90	0	0	0	28	0	90			1089-5639			WOS:000263974800028	19182970

Results are reported here on the preparation of nitrogen-doped 250 nm thick TiO2 films on glass substrates by RF magnetron sputtering. The nitrogen content in the films was modified by changing the N-2 partial pressure in the discharge from 0.00 to 0.27 Pa. An additional amount of oxygen was added in the deposition chamber (Po-2 = 0.11 Pa) to compensate for oxygen depletion in the films. Surface composition and structure were derived from XPS and XRD data, respectively. XRD data revealed a mixture of amorphous phase and rutile polymorph in the as-deposited films, while an anatase-rich phase occurs in the samples deposited under N2 pressure of 0.05 and 0.16 Pa. Above 0.16 Pa, a rutile-rich phase is present. Surface wettability was investigated from contact angle data of de-ionized water with solid surface. The films deposited under mid-range N2 pressure in the discharge are super-hydrophilic. The photo-induced super-hydrophilicity decays after 36 h. Film wettability is discussed in terms of the synergic effects of surface roughness (measured by AFM) and rutile-anatase TiO2 phase transition, induced by doping. The TiO2 surface super-hydrophilicity (and catalytic efficiency) are related to beneficial properties of anatase phase (E-g = 3.2 eV), associated with a low recombination rate of charge carriers in the surface.

A previous study (Lorigan and Britt (1994) Biochemistry 33: 12072-12076) showed that for PS II membranes treated with 5% ethanol, the S-2 state Mn cluster relaxes via the Orbach spin-lattice relaxation mechanism, where the relaxation is enhanced via phonon scattering off an excited state spin manifold, in this case at an energy of Delta = 36.5 cm(-1) above the S = 1/2 ground state giving rise to the multiline EPR signal. Parallel experiments are reported for PS II membranes with 5% methanol, treated with ammonia, and following short and long term dark adaptation. In each case, the temperature dependence of the electron spin-lattice relaxation rate is consistent with Orbach relaxation, and the range of excited state energies is relatively narrow (33.8 cm(-1) less than or equal to Delta less than or equal to 39.7 cm(-1)). In addition, short term dark adapted (6 min, 'active state') PS II membranes show biphasic recovery traces which indicate that a minority fraction of the oxygen evolving complexes are trapped in a form with greatly slowed spin-lattice relaxation.									16	0	0	0	11	0	16			0166-8595			WOS:000168825300003	16228419

In many cases, the periods of surface exposure are only small fractions of the terrestrial ages of meteorites collected in Antarctica. The enrichment of F on the surfaces of Antarctic achondrites was investigated by means of nuclear reaction analysis (NRA): scanning proton beams with an energy of 2.7 and 3.4 MeV were used to induce the reactions F-19(p,alpha gamma)160 and F-19(p,p'gamma)F-19, respectively. Gamma signals proportional to the F content were measured. The following Antarctic achondrites were investigated: Martian meteorite ALH 84001; diogenite ALHA77256; the eucrites ALHA81011 and ALHA78132; and in addition, the H5 chondrite ALHA79025. For ALH 84001, our data indicate a period of exposure on the ice of <500 years. Thus, this specimen was enclosed in the ice >95% of its terrestrial age of 13 000 years.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0026-1114			WOS:000075601500011	11543071	
J	Najafpour, Mohammad Mahdi								Candidate for Catalyst during Water-Oxidation Reaction in the Presence of Manganese Compounds, from Nanosized Particles to Impurities: Sleep with One Eye Open br								ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH				55	16			2260	2270		10.1021/acs.accounts.2c00277		JUL 2022		AUG 16 2022	2022	CONSPECTUS: Water-oxidation reaction (WOR) catalysts are critical for energy conversion. WOR is a four-electron oxidation and sluggish reaction. WOR needs a high thermodynamic driving force; it is also a kinetically slow reaction. Different compounds have been used for WOR; among these compounds, Mn materials have proven to be interesting because Mn is low-cost and also nontoxic, at least compared to many transition metals. Naturally, it has also been used in the biological water-oxidizing complex (WOC). Indeed, WOR has occurred on a huge scale in natural photosynthesis.For a long time, efforts have been made to design and synthesize various ligands and generate Mn compounds toward WOR catalysts. However, the addition or removal of electrons inside Mn compounds during harsh WOR conditions can lead to the formation or the breakage of bonds and result in the conversion of a precatalyst to a catalyst.Here, our findings on the conversion of Mn compounds to catalysts during WOR are presented. Many Mn compounds have been claimed to be catalysts for WOR in the presence of various chemical oxidants or under electrophotochemical conditions. Currently, the advances in characterization techniques and different spectroscopic methods have enabled a better understanding of catalysts. Different conversions such as that of the Mn complex to Mn oxide and Mn salts to Mn oxide during WOR have been explained. Indeed, the morphology and size of the Mn oxide formed depend on several factors such as the origin compounds, pH, ligands, and conditions. Thus, different Mn compounds show different activities toward WOR. The biomimetic models with Mn-Ca clusters are also decomposed during WOR. On the other hand, stable Mn complexes such as Mn phthalocyanines, which are very stable in the absence of potential, are easily decomposed during WOR. It is noted that for many of these Mn compounds, two steps result in the formation of Mn oxide during WOR: (i) Mn(II) or (III) leaching into the electrolyte and (ii) deposition of the leached Mn ions into the solution.Considering these steps, it can be seen that challenges remain in the area of Mn compounds, given the fact that even in the catalytic cycle at low oxidation numbers no Mn(II) or (III) should be leached to the electrolyte.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000834179000001	35881838

However, the discharge product, such as Li2O2 and LiO2, could react with carbon to form an insulating lithium carbonate layer, resulting in cathode passivation and capacity fading. To solve this problem, the development of non-carbon cathodes is highly desirable. Herein, we successfully synthesized MnCo2O4 (MCO) nanoparticles anchored on porous MoO2 nanosheets that are grown on Ni foam (current collector) (MCO/MoO2@Ni), acting as a carbon- and binder-free cathode for Li-O-2 batteries, in an attempt to improve the electrical conductivity, electrocatalytic activity, and durability. This MCO/MoO2@Ni electrode delivers excellent cyclability (more than 400cycles) and rate performance (voltage gap of 0.75V at 5000 mA g(-1)). Notably, the battery with this electrode exhibits a high energy efficiency (higher than 85%). The advanced electrochemical performance of MCO/MoO2@Ni can be attributed to its high electrical conductivity, excellent stability, and outstanding electrocatalytic activity. This work offers a new strategy to fabricate high-performance Li-O-2 batteries with non-carbon cathode materials.									23	2	0	0	0	0	23			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000424762600009	29235727

The O-, Al-, and Ti-isotopic compositions are largely compatible with an origin from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star of 1.5 solar masses with a metallicity that is 15% higher than the solar metallicity. The grain has an elevated O-17/O-16 ratio (8.40 +/- 0.16x10(-4)) compared to solar, and slightly sub-solar O-18/O-16 ratio (1.83 +/- 0.03 x 10(-3)). It shows evidence for the presence of initial Al-26, suggesting formation after the first dredge-up, during one of the early third dredge-up (TDU) episodes. Titanium isotopic data indicate condensation of the grain before significant amounts of material from the Heburning shell were admixed to the stellar surface with progressive TDUs. We observed a small excess in Si-30 (delta Si-30 = 41 +/- 5 parts per thousand), which most likely is inherited from the parent star's initial Si-isotopic composition. For such stars stellar models predict a C/O-ratio < 1 even after the onset of TDU, thus allowing the condensation of O-rich dust.The grain is an unusual complex presolar grain, consisting of an Al-Ca-Ti-oxide core, surrounded by an Mg-Ca-silicate mantle, and resembles the condensation sequence for a cooling gas of solar composition at pressures and dust/gas ratios typically observed for circumstellar envelopes around evolved stars. We also report the first observation of phosphorus in a presolar grain, although the origin of the P-bearing phase remains ambiguous. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The growth was markedly inhibited when it was treated with 4 mu M Cd. However, the biomass production was almost not influenced after a prolonged exposure at Cd concentrations <= 2 mu M. Chlorophyll content was more sensitive to Cd toxicity than phycobiliproteins at 0.5 mu M Cd. However, the decrease of phycobiliproteins was larger than chlorophyll at the highest Cd concentration. A significant increase of F-v/F-m value was observed at Cd concentrations <= 2 mu M. On the other hand, when cells were treated with 4 mu M Cd, F-v/F-m was significantly increased after 12 h of treatment but decreased after 48 h. The true photosynthesis was decreased with the increase of Cd concentration at 2 h. However, we noticed a recovery when the treatment was prolonged. After 48 h of exposure at the highest Cd concentration, photosynthetic oxygen evolution was markedly inhibited but dark respiration increased by 67%. Cellular Cd contents were augmented with the increase of Cd concentration. To our knowledge, we have demonstrated for the first time that the inhibitory site of Cd in M. aeruginosa is not located at the PSII or PSI level, but is probably situated on the ferredoxin/NADP(+)-oxido-reductase enzyme at the terminal of whole electron transport chain. We noticed also an increase of PSI activity, which is probably linked to the enhancement of cyclic electron transport around PSI. We can conclude that the increase of cyclic electron transport and dark respiration activities, and the decrease of phycobiliproteins might be adaptive mechanisms of M. aeruginosa 854 under high Cd conditions.

In this study, sludge-derived carbon (SC) catalyst was modified and applied to degrade SMZ during catalytic oxidation process. Degradation products and possible transformation pathways were investigated based on data of GC-MS. The toxicity evolution of SMZ degradation after catalytic oxidation process was tested with zebrafish and microbial degradation respirometer. As a consequence, SC modified with nitric acid (SC-HNO3) exhibited highly catalytic efficiency reached 92.2% SMZ conversion and 75.2% total organic carbon (TOC) removal rate after 480 min. Ten kinds of possible products were identified by GC-MS during degradation process of SMZ, indicating two possible pathways. No pronounced malformation was observed in the toxicity experiments with zebrafish until 120 h post fertilization (hpf). However, further analysis showed that zebrafish incubated with SMZ solution had higher mortality, lower hatching rate, slower spontaneous movement and shorter body length, compared with the group used normal nutrient solution, while the water after treatment had lower toxicity effects on zebrafish. The toxicity experiments with microbial degradation respirometer showed that SMZ solution had lower value of oxygen uptake, which indicated that SMZ solution had higher values of toxicity and inhibition of pharmaceutical compounds. This study provides a catalyst with low cost and high catalytic efficiency for degradation process of SMZ and gives a deeper insight into the ecotoxicity of treated water. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Direct measurement of the light-induced voltage ( increment V) generated by spinach oxygen-evolving PSII core complexes adsorbed onto a Millipore membrane filter (MF) on an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode under continuous illumination has been performed. PSII was shown to participate in electron transfer from water to the ITO electrode, resulting in increment V generation. No photovoltage was detected in PSII deprived of the water-oxidizing complex. The maximal and stable photoelectric signal was observed in the presence of disaccharide trehalose and 2,6-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone, acting as a redox mediator between the primary quinone acceptor Q(A) of PSII and electrode surface. Long time preservation of the steady-state photoactivity at room temperature in a simple in design ITO|PSII-MF|ITO system may be related to the retention of water molecules attached to the PSII surface in the presence of trehalose.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0145-479X	1573-6881		WOS:000589502500001	33190172

In the killifish Fundulus heteroclitus, one response to prolonged exposure to hypoxia is an increase in the activity of lactate dehydrogenase-B (LDH-B), the terminal enzyme of anaerobic glycolysis, in liver tissue (4). An increase in glycolytic enzyme activity also occurs in mammalian cells during hypoxia, a process due, in part, to increased rates of gene transcription mediated by the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, HIF-1 (5). Given that a homolog of HIF-1 has been identified in fish (6), we hypothesized that HIF might be involved in the observed up-regulation of LDH-B in F. heteroclitus. Herein, we describe the presence of DNA elements in intron 2 of the Ldh-B gene from F. heteroclitus that resemble hypoxia response elements (HRE) described for mammalian genes (7-10). Specifically, over a region of approximately 50 base pairs we identified two consensus HIF-1 binding sires, as well as DNA elements that may bind other transcription factors (e.g., cyclic AMP response elements; CRE). We found that these sites were perfectly conserved among geographically diverse populations of F. heteroclitus, as well as being highly conserved among multiple species in the genus Fundulus. The spacing, orientation, and sequence conservation of these putative regulatory elements suggest that they may be functionally involved in the hypoxic regulation of Ldh-B in these fish.									36	3	0	0	34	0	39			0006-3185			WOS:000169543000001	11441966	
J	Chan, HYH; Takoudis, CC; Weaver, MJ								High-pressure oxidation of ruthenium as probed by surface-enhanced Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				172	2			336	345		10.1006/jcat.1997.1841				DEC 1997	1997	Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been utilized to study the oxidation of ruthenium at ambient pressure (1 atm) and elevated temperatures (25-300 degrees C). The SERS probe provides in-situ vibrational information regarding surface oxide bonding. While the XPS probe necessarily involves ex-situ measurements (i.e., transfer to and from ultrahigh vacuum), it provides valuable complementary information on the metal and oxygen electronic states. Ruthenium surfaces were prepared by electrodepositing ultrathin films (about three monolayers) onto electrochemically roughened (i.e., SERS-active) gold substrates. Insight into the in-situ oxidation process was obtained by probing the changes of surface speciation by SERS upon heating Ru in flowing O-2. A pair of SERS bands at 470 and 670 cm(-1) appear in the spectrum acquired for a freshly electrodeposited film, which are assigned to different stretching modes of hydrated RuO2 formed during sample transfer to the gas-phase reactor. However, a fully reduced Ru surface (i.e., devoid of oxide features) could be formed by adsorbing a protective CO adlayer in an electrochemical cell followed by heating to 200 degrees C in vacuum so to thermally desorb the CO. While the initially oxidized (i.e., RuO2) surface was stable to further oxidation upon heating in O-2, adsorbed atomic oxygen was detected at 200 degrees C from the appearance of a SERS band at 600 cm(-1) and a XPS O(1s) peak at 531.7 eV. In contrast, the higher oxides RuO4 and possibly RuO3 were produced only upon thermal oxidation of the fully reduced Ru surface. Evidence for RuO3 formation includes the appearance of a 800 cm(-1) SERS band at 200 degrees C which correlates with the advent of a Ru(3d(5/2)) peak at 282.6 eV. The surface was further oxidized to RuO4 at 250 degrees C, as deduced from the formation of a 875 cm(-1) band and a Ru(3d(5/2)) peak at 283.3 eV. While RuO3 and RuO4 were exclusively formed at temperatures higher than 250 degrees C, RuO2 was produced upon cooling to room temperature, possibly via the decomposition of RuO4.

Ag nanoparticles (average size = 15 nm) were well-crystalline and uniformly dispersed on the P doped g-C3N4 (P@UCN) surface. Nano-Ag particles enhanced light absorption and acted as electron sink to capture photogenerated electrons, and promoted the separation of photo-induced charge. Results showed greater than 99% of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) removal within 30 min under visible light irradiation. The photodegradation rate of SMX over Ag-P@UCN was similar to 4 and 7 times faster than that on pristine g-C3N4 (UCN) and P@UCN, respectively. Ag-P@UCN was stable and could be reused for at least 6 cycles without losing photocatalytic activity. Reactive oxygen species played a significant role in the photodegradation of SMX. Overall, a new scheme to synthesize heterojunction photocatalysts, exemplified by Ag-based nanomaterials, for the heterogeneous photodegradation of organic contaminants under visible light was attained.									48	2	0	0	17	0	49			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000504405000155

Smoltification (parr-smolt transformation) is a developmental process that allows salmon to acquire seawater tolerance in preparation for marine living. Traditionally, this developmental process has been monitored using gill Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) activity or plasma hormones, but gill gene expression offers the possibility of another method. Here, we describe the discovery of candidate genes from gill tissue for staging smoltification using comparisons of microarray studies with particular focus on the commonalities between anadromous Rainbow trout and Sockeye salmon datasets, as well as a literature comparison encompassing more species. A subset of 37 candidate genes mainly from the microarray analyses was used for TaqMan quantitative PCR assay design and their expression patterns were validated using gill samples from four groups, representing three species and two ecotypes: Coho salmon, Sockeye salmon, stream-type Chinook salmon and ocean-type Chinook salmon. The best smoltification biomarkers, as measured by consistent changes across these four groups, were genes involved in ion regulation, oxygen transport and immunity. Smoltification gene expression patterns (using the top 10 biomarkers) were confirmedby significant correlations with NKA activity and were associated with changes in body brightness, caudal fin darkness and caudal peduncle length. We incorporate gene expression patterns of pre-smolt, smolt and de-smolt trials from acute seawater transfers from a companion study to develop a preliminary seawater tolerance classification model for ocean-type Chinook salmon. This work demonstrates the potential of gene expression biomarkers to stage smoltification and classify juveniles as pre-smolt, smolt or de-smolt.									16	0	0	0	13	1	16			2051-1434			WOS:000522809300003	31620289

Here, an oxygen-incorporated MoS2 (O-MoS2)/graphene composite as a self-supported intercalation host of Li-ion is prepared. The composite delivers a specific capacity of 80 mAh g(-1) in only 36 s at a mass loading of 1 mg cm(-2), and it can be cycled 3000 times (over 91% capacity retention) with a 5 mg cm(-2) loading at 2 A g(-1). The O-MoS2 exhibits a dominant 1T phase with an expanded layer spacing of 10.15 angstrom, leading to better Li-ion intercalation kinetics compared with pristine MoS2. Furthermore, ex situ X-ray diffraction tests indicate that O-MoS2 sustains a stable structure in cycling compared with the gradual collapse of pristine MoS2, which suffers from excessive lattice breathing. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the MoOx(OH)(y) pillars in O-MoS2 interlayers not only expand the layer spacing, but also tense the MoS2 layers to avoid exfoliation in cycling. Therefore, the O-MoS2 shows a pseudolayered structure, leading to remarkable durability besides the outstanding rate capability as a Li-ion intercalation host.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000451566800005	30345625

The primary objective of our study was to establish the effectiveness of TCZ in patients with severe or critical severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia. We retrospectively analyzed 25 consecutive patients, admitted in the Academic Emergency Hospital Sibiu, Romania from April 1, 2020 until May 25, 2020, all with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe pneumonia. All patients were treated off-label with TCZ, beside their standard care. Adjuvant iron chelator was associated in 11 patients. Six female and 19 male patients admitted in our hospital all with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe pneumonia as defined by Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were enrolled in this study. Seventeen of the 25 enrolled patients (68%) were seriously ill requiring noninvasive ventilation or oxygen mask, and 8 cases (32%) were critically ill requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. All patients received TCZ, and also received hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir/ritonavir 200/50 mg for 10 days. Adjuvant iron chelator (deferasirox - marketed as Exjade) was associated in 11 patients who had ferritin serum levels above 1000 ng/mL. No side effects were encountered during infusions or after TCZ. We observed a rapid increase in arterial oxygen saturation for 20 of the 25 cases (80%) with a favorable evolution toward healing. Survivors were younger than 60 years old (80%), had less comorbidities (10% no comorbidities, 70% with 1 or 2 comorbidities), lower serum ferritin levels (30% under 1000 ng/mL), and 50% had no serum glucose elevation. Our patients with CRS had no response to corticosteroid therapy. Five out of the 25 patients had an unfavorable evolution to death. The off-label use of TCZ in patients with severe or critically ill form of SARS-CoV-2 infection had good results in our study. Off-label use of TCZ in severe and critical cases of COVID-19 pneumonia is effective in managing the "cytokine storm." Better outcomes were noted in younger patients. Associated adjuvant iron chelators may contribute to a good outcome and needs to be confirmed in larger studies.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0025-7974	1536-5964		WOS:000658917700081	33950993

The perception of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from invading microorganisms inhibits auxin signaling and plant growth. Conversely, pathogens manipulate auxin signaling to promote disease, but how this hormone inhibits immunity is not fully understood. Ustilago maydis is a maize pathogen that induces auxin signaling in its host. We characterized a U. maydis effector protein, Naked1 (Nkd1), that is translocated into the host nucleus. Through its native ethylene-responsive element binding factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif, Nkd1 binds to the transcriptional co-repressors TOPLESS/TOPLESS-related (TPL/TPRs) and prevents the recruitment of a transcriptional repressor involved in hormonal signaling, leading to the derepression of auxin and jasmonate signaling and thereby promoting susceptibility to (hemi)biotrophic pathogens. A moderate upregulation of auxin signaling inhibits the PAMP-triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst, an early defense response. Thus, our findings establish a clear mechanism for auxin-induced pathogen susceptibility. Engineered Nkd1 variants with increased expression or increased EAR-mediated TPL/TPR binding trigger typical salicylic-acid-mediated defense reactions, leading to pathogen resistance. This implies that moderate binding of Nkd1 to TPL is a result of a balancing evolutionary selection process to enable TPL manipulation while avoiding host recognition.

Here we present a design strategy to optimize the stability and electronic property of noble metal single atoms (MSAs, M = Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, Au) catalyst supported on g-C3N4 and 2H-MoS2 photocatalysts towards NRR and CRR. Our results indicate that the MSAs tend to be trapped at the anion-vacancy sites of photocatalyst rather than the pristine photocatalyst surface. This anion vacancy can promise the MSAs with an optimized electron-captured ability in the photoexcitation process, thus decreasing the energy barriers of NRR and CRR on MSAs. Especially, it is revealed that the N-vacancy-stabilized IrSA on g-C3N4 and the S-vacancy-stabilized RhSA on 2H-MoS2 own the lowest energy barrier in NRR. However, for CRR, the HCOOH is the main product on MSAs supported by gC3N4 and 2H-MoS2. The N-vacancy-stabilized PdSA on g-C3N4 and the S-vacancy-stabilized AuSA on 2H-MoS2 show the lowest energy barrier for HCOOH production in CRR. This finding offers an approach to design specific active MSA centres on photocatalysts by the anion vacancy engineering. (C) 2019 Science China Press.

J	Cook, RM; Carvalho-Queiroz, C; Wilding, G; LoVerde, PT								Nucleic acid vaccination with Schistosoma mansoni antioxidant enzyme cytosolic superoxide dismutase and the structural protein filamin confers protection against the adult worm stage								INFECTION AND IMMUNITY				72	10			6112	6124		10.1128/IAI.72.10.6112-6124.2004				OCT 2004	2004	Schistosomiasis remains a worldwide endemic cause of chronic and debilitating illness. There are two paradigms that exist in schistosome immunology. The first is that the schistosomulle stages are the most susceptible to immune killing, and the second is that the adult stage, through evolution of defense mechanisms, can survive in the hostile host environment. One mechanism that seems to aid the adult worm in evading immune killing is the expression of antioxidant enzymes to neutralize the effects of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Here, we challenge one paradigm by targeting adult Schistosoma mansoni worms for immune elimination in an experimental mouse model using two S. mansoni antioxidants, cytosollic superoxide dismutase (SmCT-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (SmGPX), and a partial coding sequence for a structural protein, filamin, as DNA vaccine candidates. DNA vaccination with SmCT-SOD induced a mean of 39% protection, filamin induced a mean of 50% protection, and SmGPX induced no protection compared to controls following challenge with adult worms by surgical transfer. B- and T-cell responses were analyzed in an attempt to define the protective immune mechanism(s) involved in adult worm killing. SmCT-SOD-immunized mice presented with a T1 response, and filamin-immunized mice showed a mixed T1-T2 response. We provide evidence for natural boosting after vaccination. Our results demonstrate that adult worms can be targeted for immune elimination through vaccination. This represents an advance in schistosome vaccinology and allows for the development of a therapeutic as well as a prophylactic vaccine.									41	3	0	0	32	0	45			0019-9567	1098-5522		WOS:000224134000067	15385516

Wilson, Sam/0000-0002-1273-3071			Quantitative assessment of the high-light tolerance in plants with an impaired photosystem II donor side								BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL				476				1377	1386		10.1042/BCJ20190208				MAY 15 2019	2019	Photoinhibition is the light-induced down-regulation of photosynthetic efficiency, the primary target of which is photosystem II (PSII). Currently, there is no clear consensus on the exact mechanism of this process. However, it is clear that inhibition can occur through limitations on both the acceptor-and donor side of PSII. The former mechanism is caused by electron transport limitations at the PSII acceptor side. Whilst, the latter mechanism relies on the disruption of the oxygen-evolving complex. Both of these mechanisms damage the PSII reaction centre (RC). Using a novel chlorophyll fluorescence methodology, RC photoinactivation can be sensitively measured and quantified alongside photo-protection in vivo. This is achieved through estimation of the redox state of QA, using the parameter of photochemical quenching in the dark (qPd). This study shows that through the use of PSII donor-side inhibitors, such as UV-B and Cd2+, there is a steeper gradient of photoinactivation in the systems with a weakened donor side, independent of the level of NPQ attained. This is coupled with a concomitant decline in the light tolerance of PSII. The native light tolerance is partially restored upon the use of 1,5-diphenylcarbazide (DPC), a PSII electron donor, allowing for the balance between the inhibitory pathways to be sensitively quantified. Thus, this study confirms that the impact of donor-side inhibition can be detected alongside acceptor-side photoinhibition using the qPd parameter and confirms qPd as a valid, sensitive and unambiguous parameter to sensitively quantify the onset of photoinhibition through both acceptor- or donor-side mechanisms.									11	0	0	0	9	0	11			0264-6021	1470-8728		WOS:000468517300004	31036714	
J	Rikihisa, Yasuko								Molecular events involved in cellular invasion by Ehrlichia chaffeensis and Anaplasma phagocytophilum								VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY				167	2-4	SI		155	166		10.1016/j.vetpar.2009.09.017				FEB 10 2010	2010	Ehrlichia chaffeensis and Anaplasma phagocytophilum are obligatory intracellular bacteria that preferentially replicate inside leukocytes by utilizing biological compounds and processes of these primary host defensive cells. These bacteria incorporate cholesterol from the host for their survival. Upon interaction with host monocytes and granulocytes, respectively, these bacteria usurp the lipid raft domain containing GPI-anchored protein to induce a series of signaling events that result in internalization of the bacteria. Monocytes and neutrophils usually kill invading microorganisms by fusion of the phagosomes containing the bacteria with granules containing both antimicrobial peptides and lysosomal hydrolytic enzymes and/or through sequestering vital nutrients. However, E. chaffeensis and A. phagocytophilum alter vesicular traffic to create a unique intracellular membrane-bound compartment that allows their replication in seclusion from lysosomal killing. These bacteria are quite sensitive to reactive oxygen species (ROS), so in order to survive in host cells that are primary mediators of ROS-induced killing, they inhibit activation of NADPH oxidase and assembly of this enzyme in their inclusion compartments. Moreover, host phagocyte activation and differentiation, apoptosis, and IFN-gamma signaling pathways are inhibited by these bacteria. Through reductive evolution, lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan that activate the innate immune response, have been eliminated from these gram-negative bacteria at the genomic level. Upon interaction with new host cells, bacterial genes encoding the Type IV secretion apparatus and the two-component regulatory system are up-regulated to sense and adapt to the host environment. Thus dynamic signal transduction events concurrently proceed both in the host cells and in the invading E. chaffeensis and A. phagocytophilum bacteria for successful establishment of intracellular infection. Several bacterial surface-exposed proteins and porins are recently identified. Further functional studies on Ehrlichia and Anaplasma effector or ligand molecules and cognate host cell receptors will undoubtedly advance our understanding of the complex interplay between obligatory intracellular pathogens and their hosts. Such data can be applied towards treatment, diagnosis, and control of ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Among them, beta-1,2,3-tri-O-galloyl-4,6-(S)-hexahydroxydiphenoyl-D-glucose (tellimagrandin II) is the major active substance and is an effective inhibitor of microalgal exoenzymes. However, this mode of action does not fully explain the strong allelopathic activity observed in bioassays. Lipophilic extracts of M. spicatum inhibit photosynthetic oxygen evolution of intact cyanobacteria and other photoautotrophs. Fractionation of the extract provided evidence for tellimagrandin II as the active compound. Separate measurements of photosystem I and II activity with spinach (Spinacia oleracea) thylakoid membranes indicated that the site of inhibition is located at photosystem II (PSII). In thermoluminescence measurements with thylakoid membranes and PSII-enriched membrane fragments M. spicatum extracts shifted the maximum temperature of the B-band (S(2)Q(B)(-) recombination) to higher temperatures. Purified tellimagrandin II in concentrations as low as 3 muM caused a comparable shift of the B-band. This demonstrates that the target site of this inhibitor is different from the Q(B)-binding site, a common target of commercial herbicides like 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea. Measurements with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy suggest a higher redox midpoint potential for the non-heme iron, located between the primary and the secondary quinone electron acceptors, Q(A) and Q(B). Thus, tellimagrandin II has at least two modes of action, inhibition of exoenzymes and inhibition of PSII. Multiple target sites are a common characteristic of many potent allelochemicals.									145	21	0	0	135	4	170			0032-0889			WOS:000179990100046	12481084

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced in response to metabolic processes, radiation, metal oxidation, and pathological infections. High levels of ROS lead to cell death via autophagy. However, thioredoxin acts as an active regulatory enzyme in response to excessive ROS. Here, we performed in-silico analysis, immune challenge experiments, and functional assays of seahorse thioredoxin-like protein 1 (ShTXNL1). Evolutionary identification showed that ShTXNL1 protein belongs to the thioredoxin superfamily comprising 289 amino acids. It possesses an N-terminal active thioredoxin domain and C-terminal proteasome-interacting thioredoxin domain (PITH) of ShTXNL1 which is a component of 26S proteasome and binds to the matrix or cell. Pairwise alignment results showed 99.0% identity and 99.7% similarity with the sequence of Hippocampus species. Conserved thiol-disulfide cysteine residue containing Cys-X-X-Cys motif may be found in the first few amino acids in the second beta sheet starting from the N-terminus. This motif can be discovered in ShTXNL1 as 14CRPC17 and comprised two N-linked glycosylation sites at (72)NISA(75) and (NESD142)-N-139. According to the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis from healthy seahorses, highest ShTXNL1 mRNA expression was observed in muscle, followed by ovary, brain, gill, and blood tissues. Moreover, significant temporal expression of ShTXNL1 was observed in gill and blood tissues after bacterial stimuli. Thus, the ShTXNL1 gene may be identified as an immunologically important gene in seahorse.									8	0	0	0	8	0	9			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000428824900022	29427717

The majority of higher plants, in contrast, can not survive desiccation.Recently, at least three groups of adaptation mechanisms have been outlined for seeds and seedlings that are able to survive cellular desiccation. One of these mechanisms is the capability to scavenge desiccation-induced free radicals and this is afforded by antioxidative and/or enzymic pathways. Indeed, desiccation-induced foe radicals were found in numerous tissues, and some authors correlated desiccation tolerance with maintenance or synthesis of antioxidants as glutathione (gamma-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine, GSH), ascorbic acid (AA) or tocopherols and/or enzymes scavenging cytotoxic oxygen species as superoxide dismutase, catalase or peroxidases.In this paper, we review the role of some antioxidants and enzymes related to protection from oxidative stress in desiccation tolerant and desiccation sensitive cryptogamics. In detail, we discuss the role of glutathione, that prays an important part for overcoming desiccation. This is demonstrated by studies on three lichen species differing in their tolerance to desiccation. Here, the formation of oxidised glutathione (GSSG) during desiccation and its reduction upon rehydration is interpreted as an adaptation mechanism to drought. Indeed, these results fit well to a thiol-disulphide cycle postulated recently for plants overcoming desiccation. This hypothesis depends upon the idea that protein thiol groups are protected from irreversible auto-oxidation by the reaction of GSSG with protein thiol groups (PSH), thus forming protein-bound glutathione (PSSG) and GSH during desiccation. With further desiccation, the oxidation of GSH continues leading to high final concentrations of PSSG and GSSG. By these oxidation steps, PSH and GSH are protected from desiccation-induced oxidative injury such as irreversible formation of intramolecular cross links in proteins or uncontrolled oxidation of SH groups, e.g. to sulfonic acids. Moreover, these studies on lichens indicate that tolerance to desiccation can be correlated with the mobilisation of two enzymes, glutathione reductase (GR) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) needed for the reduction of the GSSG formed under desiccating conditions. The latter is the key enzyme of the oxidative pentose shunt that provides the NADPH required for the action of GR. This pathway has special importance for resurrection plants that are not able to provide NADPH from photosynthesis in the first stages of recovery following desiccation.					2nd International Conference on Oxygen, Free Radicals and Environmental Stress in Plants2nd International Conference on Oxygen, Free Radicals and Environmental Stress in Plants	SEP 10-13, 1996SEP 10-13, 1996	Soc Free Radical ResSoc Free Radical Res	VIENNA, AUSTRIAVIENNA, AUSTRIA	17	0	0	0	16	0	17			0079-2047			WOS:000072858400018

The as-prepared nanocomposite was utilized towards improved photocatalytic wastewater treatment and toxicity removal. Initially, individual ZnWO4 and WO3 nanostructures were synthesized using an IL-assisted solvothermal method. Thereafter, the subsequent modification of the ZnWO4 and WO3 nanostructures with the polyaniline (PANI) conducting polymer was done by in situ oxidative polymerization of PANI. Comprehensive analysis of the structural and morphological properties of the nanocomposite revealed high structural integrity and close contact between the individual components. The optical and photo-electrochemical investigations suggested rapid charge carrier separation, suitable band arrangement, and a superior lifetime of the nanocomposite. Afterward, the recyclable ternary nanocomposite demonstrated a higher solar light-mediated photocatalytic degradation of the toxic glyphosate (GLP) herbicide (K-app = 0.0707 min(-1)). Additionally, the non-toxic nature of the nanocomposite (after a catalytic cycle) and treated GLP solutions were assessed via the standard TBE (trypan blue dye exclusion) assay. Furthermore, the XPS analysis, radical trapping experiment, and reactive oxygen species quantification (HO and O-2(-)) study suggested a possible double electron transfer type Z-scheme mechanism, which accounts for superior solar light-assisted N-C bond cleavage of GLP herbicide.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2051-8153	2051-8161		WOS:000684646900001

As a consequence, it contains large amounts of this carotenoid and lacks epoxy-xanthophylls, HPLC analysis of pigment contents in leaves, isolated thylakoids and preparations of the major light-harvesting complex of photosystem II (PSII) (LHC-II) indicated that zeaxanthin replaced neoxanthin, violaxanthin and antheraxanthin in the light-harvesting system of PSII in aba-1. Non-denaturing electrophoretic fractionation of solubilized thylakoids showed that the xanthophyll imbalance in aba-1 was associated with a pronounced decrease in trimeric LHC-II in favour of monomeric complexes, with a substantial increase in free pigments (mainly zeaxanthin and chlorophyll b), suggesting a decreased stability of LHC-II. The reduced thermostability of PSII in aba-1 was also deduced from in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence measurements. Wild-type and aba-1 leaves could not be distinguished on the basis of their photosynthetic performance: no significant difference was observed between the two types of leaves for light-limited and light-saturated photosynthetic oxygen evolution, PSII photochemistry and PSII to PSI electron how. When dark-adapted leaves (grown in white light of 80 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) were suddenly exposed to red light of 150 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), there was a strong nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence, the amplitude of which was virtually identical (at steady state) in aba-1 and wild-type leaves, despite the fact that the xanthophyll cycle pigment pool was completely in the form of zeaxanthin in aba-1 and almost exclusively in the form of violaxanthin in the wild type. A. high concentration of zeaxanthin in aba-1 thylakoids did not, in itself, provide any particular protection against the photoinhibition of PSII. Taken together, the presented results indicate the following: (1) zeaxanthin can replace epoxy-xanthophylls in LHC-II without significantly affecting the photochemical efficiency of PSII; (2) zeaxanthin does not play any specific role in direct (thermal) energy dissipation in PSII; (3) the photoprotective action of the xanthophyll cycle (rapid photoconversion of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin) is not based on the mere substitution of violaxanthin by zeaxanthin in the chlorophyll antennae.									76	1	3	0	67	0	77			1011-1344			WOS:A1996VB90000015	8765663

However, our knowledge of potato bacterial wilt pathogenesis is scarce as a result of the technical difficulties of potato plant manipulation. Thus, we established a multiple screening system (virulence screen of effector mutants in potato, growth inhibition of yeast and transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana) of core type III effectors (T3Es) of a major potato pathovar of phylotype IIB, to provide more research perspectives and biological tools. Using this system, we identified four effectors contributing to virulence during potato infection, with two exhibiting multiple phenotypes in two other systems, including RipAB. Further study showed that RipAB is an unknown protein with a nuclear localization signal (NLS). Furthermore, we generated a ripAB complementation strain and transgenic ripAB-expressing potato plants, and subsequent virulence assays confirmed that R. solanacearum requires RipAB for full virulence. Compared with wild-type potato, transcriptomic analysis of transgenic ripAB-expressing potato plants showed a significant down-regulation of Ca2+ signalling-related genes in the enriched Plant-Pathogen Interaction (PPI) gene ontology (GO) term. We further verified that, during infection, RipAB is required for the down-regulation of four Ca2+ sensors, Stcml5, Stcml23, Stcml-cast and Stcdpk2, and a Ca2+ transporter, Stcngc1. Further evidence showed that the immune-associated reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst is attenuated in ripAB transgenic potato plants. In conclusion, a systematic screen of conserved R. solanacearum effectors revealed an important role for RipAB, which interferes with Ca2+-dependent gene expression to promote disease development in potato.									17	0	0	0	14	0	17			1464-6722	1364-3703		WOS:000461896600007	30499228

We compare the effect of solar induced X-ray and EUV (XUV) heating on the upper atmospheres of Earth, Venus and Mars since the time when the Sun arrived at the Zero-Age-Main-Sequence (ZAMS) about 4.6 Gyr ago. We apply a diffusive-gravitational equilibrium and thermal balance model for studying heating of the early thermospheres by photodissociation and ionization processes, due to exothermic chemical reactions and cooling by IR-radiating molecules like CO2, NO, OH, etc. Our model simulations result in extended thermospheres for early Earth, Venus and Mars. The exospheric temperatures obtained for all the three planets during this time period lead to diffusion-limited hydrodynamic escape of atomic hydrogen and high Jeans' escape rates for heavier species like H-2, He, C, N, O, etc. The duration of this blow-off phase for atomic hydrogen depends essentially on the mixing ratios of CO2, N-2 and H2O in the atmospheres and could last from similar to 100 to several hundred million years. Furthermore, we study the efficiency of various non-thermal atmospheric loss processes on Venus and Mars and investigate the possible protecting effect of the early martian magnetosphere against solar wind induced ion pick up erosion. We find that the early martian magnetic field could decrease the ion-related non-thermal escape rates by a great amount. It is possible that non-magnetized early Mars could have lost its whole atmosphere due to the combined effect of its extended upper atmosphere and a dense solar wind plasma flow of the young Sun during about 200 Myr after the Sun arrived at the ZAMS. Depending on the solar wind parameters, our model simulations for early Venus show that ion pick up by strong solar wind from a non-magnetized planet could erode up to an equivalent amount of similar to 250 bar of O+ ions during the first several hundred million years. This accumulated loss corresponds to an equivalent mass of similar to 1 terrestrial ocean (TO (1 TO similar to 1.39x10(24) g or expressed as partial pressure, about 265 bar, which corresponds to similar to 2900 m average depth)). Finally, we discuss and compare our findings with the results of preceding studies.									84	0	0	0	4	0	84			0038-6308	1572-9672		WOS:000248906500008

Stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric bismuth oxyhalides (BiOX and BixOyXz where X = Cl, Br, and I) are a relatively new class of semiconductors that have attracted considerable interest for photocatalysis applications due to attributes, viz., high stability, suitable band structure, modifiable energy bandgap and two-dimensional layered structure capable of generating an internal electric field. Recently, the construction of heterojunction photocatalysts, especially 2D/2D systems, has convincingly drawn momentous attention practicably owing to the productive influence of having two dissimilar layered semiconductors in face-to-face contact with each other. This review has systematically summarized the recent progress on the 2D/2D heterojunction constructed between BiOX/BixOyXz with graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4). The band structure of individual components, various fabrication methods, different strategies developed for improving the photocatalytic performance and their applications in the degradation of various organic contaminants, hydrogen (H-2) evolution, carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction, nitrogen (N-2) fixation and the organic synthesis of clean chemicals are summarized. The perspectives and plausible opportunities for developing high performance BiOX/BixOyXz-g-C3N4 heterojunction photocatalysts are also discussed.									25	0	0	0	3	0	25				2073-4344		WOS:000642872300001

These features are the results of several technological demands coming from different application fields. This review paper aims to collect information which could be useful in understanding the fundamentals and applications of Mild Combustion. The information in this field are still sparse, because of the recent identification of the process, so that many speculative considerations have been presented in order to make the whole framework more consistent and rich with potential new applications.A rigorous definition of Mild Combustion is preliminarily given in order to fix the input variables of the process. Under these constraints the influence of the physical, thermodynamic and chemical variables on the most relevant outlet parameters are analyzed.The physical aspects taken into account are atomization, evaporation, mixing and radiative heat transfer. In particular, the evolution of the mixing layer for high temperature diluted oxidant is analyzed. It is shown that mass fluxes through the stoichiometric isosurfaces are lower than those in not diluted conditions and that the annihilation of these isosurfaces is enhanced in the Mild Combustion conditions. Both effects infer low rates of heat release according to the experimental results reported in the literature.The thermodynamic aspects are dealt through the comparative analysis of the minimum, maximum and equilibrium temperature profiles versus the mixture fraction in the whole allowable range for the diluted and not-diluted cases.The chemical aspects have been analyzed in relation to the chemical kinetics rates for different oxidative routes and the temporal evolution of the self-ignition process. The molecular oxygen addition, the hydroperoxide dissociation and atomic hydrogen oxidation are evaluated in wide pressure and temperature ranges. In such a way self-ignition regimes which rely on different preferential chemical kinetics routes are identified and comparison between diluted/not diluted conditions are performed for a fixed evolution time. In this case it is shown that Mild Combustion conditions extend the pressure-temperature range, in which the oxidation is depressed, at relatively low pressure, whereas the 'ceiling temperature' is shifted to lower temperature for Mild Combustion condition at higher pressure.The second part of the review shows the potentialities of the diluted high temperature air combustion in applications related both to efficiency and pollution of thermal generation as well as to abatement of the pollutants along the flue gas stream of a primary combustion system.Some selected examples in these fields as land-base gas-turbines, boiler combustion chamber and domestic heating systems are presented. In these, the emphasis, is put preliminarily on aspects related more to efficiency than to pollution reduction, even though this target is implicitly taken into consideration. Then environmental benefits are dealt in relation to the major and minor species, either organic or inorganic, which can be produced in gas/liquid combustion. They include carbonaceous material, unburned hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides.Finally, a classification of the possible processes relevant along the whole fuel transformation in Mild Combustion is given. In particular 'clean', 'cleaning', 'clearing' combustion processes are identified as a convenient categorization in relation to the incorporation of pre-combustion or post-combustion units in the main combustion systems.

CoPc interacts with N dopants and CoN3, forming N-CoPc and CoN3-CoPc sites via 7C-7C and Co-Co interactions. HPC-Co/CoPc (5:1) produced syngas at industrial current densities (> 200 and 880 mA cm-2 for the H-type and flow cell, respectively). Rechargeable Zn-CO2 batteries based on this catalyst had current densities of 7 and 10 mA cm-2 at ideal H2/CO ratios of 2 and 3, respectively. The efficient production of syngas is attributed to synergistic catalysis between N-CoPc (for CO2 reduction) and CoN3-CoPc (for hydrogen evolution). This work presents a versatile strategy for the synthesis of dual single-atom-based carbon electrocatalysts for efficient conversion of CO2 to syngas. This strategy is superior to conventional high-temperature pyrolysis that is difficult to control the atomic dispersion of distinct metal sites.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000663273500005

The development of green materials for clean energy storage and conversion is conducive to promoting the widespread use of clean energy. Conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) have been synthesized with various structures and properties, which offer designability for the molecular structures and nanopores of conjugated skeletons. The research of CMPs in clean energy technologies is significant for the improvement of CMP-based materials and their application in energy and environmental engineering. CMPs have shown great potential for challenging energy and environmental issues such as gas adsorption, photocatalysis, solar energy conversion, and electrical energy storage and conversion. This review aims to summarize the advances of synthesis and design on CMPs, computer simulations on CMPs, and the applications of CMPs in the clean energy technologies including hydrogen evolution and storage, the adsorption and conversion of carbon dioxide, rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells, and photovoltaic cells.

A pressing need is to explore a novel method to tune the electronic band structures and gain insightful knowledge of the structure-property relationships. In this work, taking silver orthophosphate (Ag3PO4) as an example, a static pressure technique is applied to modulate the band gap and indirect-direct band character via altering its crystal structure and lattice parameters. Under ambient conditions, cubic Ag3PO4 possesses an indirect-band gap of similar to 2.4 eV. At elevated pressure, the band gap of Ag3PO4 narrowed from 2.4 eV to 1.8 eV, reaching the optimal value for efficient solar water splitting. During the pressure-induced structural evolution from cubic to trigonal phases, the indirect-to-direct band gap crossover was predicted by first-principles calculations combined with structure search and synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments. Strikingly, the observed band gap narrowing was partially retained after releasing pressure to ambient pressure. This work paves an alternative pathway to engineer the electronic structure of semiconductor photocatalysts and design better photo-functional materials.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000460687400077

Frictional rubbing of the stirring rod onto the bottom of the glass vessel is an important condition. The friction between the stirring rod and the glass surface generates an electrostatic field to make a field emission of positive holes from the semiconductor-powder. which is fixed in the micro crack spaces on the glass surface. The emitted positive holes react with water molecules to evolve O-2 and protons, which go to the glass surface and combine with the electrons there to evolve H-2. The energy conversion mechanism, the generation of frictional electricity, the effect of the water, the carrier-tunnelling emission probability, the hopping conduction in the semiconductor, and the effects of fluid dynamics, are discussed.

To study the extent of this variety in a realistic combustion system, we simulated the growth of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) in a diffusion coflow flame using a three-component Jet A-1 surrogate (n-decane/propylbenzene/propylcyclohexane) as fuel. A kinetic Monte Carlo software, which generates samples of the atomistic evolution of gas-phase molecules' growth, was used to characterize the PACs' growth in this flame. We leveraged our simulations to identify a number of aromatic structures. In addition to aromatic hydrocarbons, we were able to reproduce the diverse array of oxygenated PACs observed experimentally between 150u and 450u, specifically a number of PACs with five-membered carbon rings and furan, hydroxl, and ketone groups. The amount of PACs with masses between 450u and 600u was slightly over-predicted, indicating that in this mass range there are possibly other mechanisms (e.g., radical-radical interactions) that reduce the concentration of these PACs. As our growth mechanism is focused mostly on aromatic growth, we did not observe the more aliphatic molecules seen in experiment. Overall, our results suggest that there is a wide range of structures with different degrees of oxygenation and aromaticity that must be accounted for when modeling PACs' growth in combustion environments.					16th International Conference on Combustion By-Products and their Health Effects (PIC)16th International Conference on Combustion By-Products and their Health Effects (PIC)	JUL 10-12, 2019JUL 10-12, 2019	Natl Inst Environm Hlth Sci; U S EPA; Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth; Univ Michigan, Civil & Environm Engn Dept; Univ Michigan, Mech Engn Dept; Univ Michigan, Aerosp Engn Dept; Univ Michigan, Climate & Space Sci & Engn DeptNatl Inst Environm Hlth Sci; U S EPA; Univ Michigan, Sch Publ Hlth; Univ Michigan, Civil & Environm Engn Dept; Univ Michigan, Mech Engn Dept; Univ Michigan, Aerosp Engn Dept; Univ Michigan, Climate & Space Sci & Engn Dept	Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MIUniv Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI	7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000518815900013

If particle size becomes comparable to the Fermi wavelength of an electron, i.e. <2 nm, then this is a cluster. Reducing the size from the bulk material to nanoparticles displays a scaling behavior in physical properties in the later ones, due to the large surface-to-volume portion. Through further size reduction, entering into the subnanometric cluster region, physical properties are largely affected by strong quantum confinement. These quantum size effects (HOMO-LUMO gap), the small size and the specific geometry grants subnanometric clusters with entirely novel properties, including cluster photoluminescence, enhanced catalytic activity, etc. In this literature review, an introduction to the physical properties of clusters is reported; the controlled synthesis methods and the catalytic properties in hydrogen evolution. Hydrogen (H-2) production by water splitting is hindered mainly by the lack of low-cost and efficient photocatalysts. Here, we show that sub-nanometric metal clusters can be used as photocatalysts for H-2 production in the presence of holes or electrons scavengers by water splitting. This illustrates the considerable potential of very small zerovalent, metallic clusters as novel atomic-level photocatalysts.									31	2	1	0	5	0	33			1364-0321	1879-0690		WOS:000410011500064

Surface support modes, which are intense in the case of SnO2, have been especially investigated. Their relative intensity decreases with an increase in vanadium loading. This damping phenomenon is not due to a vanadium doping effect into SnO2 but to the coverage by the polymerically supported phase. Here, a new method for the estimation of the maximum coverage of the supported vanadium oxide on SnO2 was developed. It was deduced from the evolution of the relative intensity of surface support modes. The first step of the method consists of measuring and calibrating the relative intensity of SnO2 surface modes according to the specific surface area. Then, the vanadium coverage is calculated from the difference in the relative intensity of surface modes between the covered and the uncovered support. A maximum surface coverage of 3V/nm(2) was found by this method.									36	2	0	0	0	0	36			1520-6106			WOS:000179985100025		
J	Fox, Jane L.; Hac, Aleksander B.								Photochemical escape of oxygen from Mars: A comparison of the exobase approximation to a Monte Carlo method								ICARUS				204	2			527	544		10.1016/j.icarus.2009.07.005				DEC 2009	2009	The non-thermal escape of neutral O atoms from Mars at the current epoch is largely due to dissociative recombination of O-2(+):O-2(+)(v,J) + e -> O* + O* + Delta E.There are five energetically allowed channels of this reaction, with exothermicities, and thus O kinetic energies, that depend on the on electronic energies of the O atoms produced, on the vibrational and rotational state of the initial O-2(+) ions, and on the ion and electron velocities. We here construct high and low solar activity models of the martian thermosphere/ionosphere for a solar zenith angle of 60 degrees. The background neutral atmosphere comprises 12 neutral species, whose density profiles range from 80 to 700 km. We calculate the density profiles for 14 ions from 80 to 400 km for both eroded and non-eroded ionospheric models. Using previously described methods, we model the vibrational distribution of the O-2(+)(v) ions as a function of altitude and compute the nascent kinetic energy distribution of the hot O atoms. We then predict the photochemical escape rate of O atoms from Mars in two ways: first by employing the exobase approximation, and second, by using a spherical Monte Carlo code, which tracks the energetic O atoms as they collide with other species in their paths from their initial production altitudes, energies and angles. The O atoms are assumed to escape if they reach 700 km with energies greater than the escape energy. We carry out these Monte Carlo calculations using two different approximations for the distribution of scattering angles in the center-of-mass frame. We first assume that the scattering is isotropic, and then we do the same calculations for a more realistic forward-scattering distribution. We find that the calculated O escape rates for the isotropic model are comparable to those for the exobase approximation, but that the escape rates for the more realistic forward scattering model are an order of magnitude larger.

Immersion tests in concentrated 9 M H2SO4 solution open to air at 30-degrees-C show that the corrosion resistance of amorphous Fe-8Cr-20P alloy is very much higher than that of amorphous Fe-8Cr-13P-7C alloy. The corrosion loss of the amorphous Fe-8Cr-20P alloy is hardly detected by a microbalance even though the open circuit potential is initially in the active region of chromium. By contrast, the amorphous Fe-8Cr-13P-7C alloy shows active dissolution initially and the corrosion loss of this alloy increases gradually with immersion time. Only 30 mV difference in the initial open circuit potentials is responsible for the difference in the passivation behavior, with spontaneous passivation of the Fe-8Cr-20P alloy without initial active dissolution and delayed spontaneous passivation of the Fe-8Cr-13P-7C alloy with initial active dissolution. The presence of phosphorus ennobles the open circuit potentials of Fe-8Cr-13P-7C and Fe-8Cr-20P alloys sharply from the active region to the passive region of chromium by suppressing the anodic dissolution and accelerating the cathodic reactions of hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction. XPS analysis indicates that the chromium content in the passive film increases with time of immersion following the ennoblement of the open circuit potential. The passivity of the Fe-8Cr-20P alloy which has a higher corrosion resistance than that of the Fe-8Cr-13P-7C alloy is maintained by the passive film in which chromium is less enriched in comparison with the passive film on the Fe-8Cr-13P-7C alloy. Phosphorus and chromium enhance synergistically the corrosion resistance. Phosphorus stimulates passivation and chromium forms the passive oxyhydroxide film.									12	1	0	0	0	0	13			0010-938X			WOS:A1994PE57500007

Among various forms of TiO2 nanostructures, clusters are the most widely used due to high surface to volume ratio. In this context, we present first principles calculations to study the size-dependent evolution of the chemical reactivity and site selectivity of (TiO2)(n) nanoclusters with n = 5-10. In the framework of the density functional theory, we employ the global parameters to quantitatively describe the chemical reactivity of different sizes of (TiO2)(n) clusters. Then, on the basis of the symmetry for each size of TiO2 cluster, susceptibility of Ti and O atoms pertinent to nucleophilic and electrophilic attacks is anticipated using local reactivity descriptors. Further, we validate the obtained reactivity pattern for considered (TiO2)(n) clusters by explicit adsorption of H2O2. It is found that upon the adsorption, H2O2 decomposes to two OH radicals that are stabilized by the interaction with Ti and O atoms on the cluster surface. The characterization of Ti center dot center dot center dot O and O center dot center dot center dot H interactions has also been performed by analyzing the parameters derived from the quantum theory of atoms in molecules.

Most previous studies of dealloyed Pt alloys focused on the structure and mechanism of dealloyed Pt-Cu bimetallic materials. Also, stability concerns related to Cu prompted the search for alternative non-noble metal components for dealloying.Here, we report on a comparative study of dealloyed binary PtM3 (M = Co, Cu, Ni) electrocatalyst for use in PEMFC cathodes. We also study synergistic effects of a third metal in ternary PtNi3M (M Co, Cu, Fe, Cr) cathode electrocatalysts. All catalyst precursor materials were prepared by an impregnation, freeze-drying, annealing route. After deployment of the catalyst precursor in single PEM cells, the active dealloyed form of the catalysts was obtained through a voltammetric dealloying protocol. Dealloyed binary PtM3 catalysts showed more than a threefold activity improvement for ORR for M = Co, Cu, and close to a threefold improvement for M = Ni in terms of the Pt-mass activity (A mg(pt)(-1)) of the single fuel cell, compared to a 45 wt% Pt/C reference cathode catalyst. Improvements in specific surface area normalized activities (A cm(pt)(-2)) followed those in Pt-mass activity. All ternary catalysts, except the Fe containing one, showed clearly improved catalytic ORR performance compared to PtNi3, in particular PtNi3Co and PtNi3Cu. A previously unachieved four- to fivefold activity improvement in real single MEAs was observed.Near-surface (XPS) and bulk (EDS/ICP) compositional characterizations suggested that the degree of dealloying of Pt-Co and Pt-Ni binary precursors is lower than that of Pt-Cu compounds. Pt-Co and Pt-Ni still showed 15-20 at.% non-noble metal near the surface and in the bulk of the dealloyed particles, whereas, under the chosen dealloying conditions, Pt-Cu formed core-shell structures with a Pt-rich surface and a Pt-Cu core. Of the selectively characterized Pt-Ni-Co and Pt-Ni-Cu ternaries, the near-surface composition of dealloyed Pt-Ni compounds showed an atomic ratio of about 1:1, compared to about 5:1 in the bulk, pointing to a Ni enrichment at the surface with only small residual amounts of Co or Cu.Our study highlights a number of novel active cathode catalyst compositions and underscores the sensitive dependence of the ORR activity of dealloyed Pt binary and ternary nanoparticle electrocatalysts on the nature and initial composition of the non-noble alloy component.

J	Bukhov, NG; Carpentier, R								The efficiency of electron transfer from Q(A)(-) to the donor side of photosystem II decreases during induction of photosynthesis: Evidences from chlorophyll fluorescence and photoacoustic techniques								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				47	1			13	20		10.1007/BF00017749				JAN 1996	1996	The amplitudes ratio of the fast and slow phases (A(fast)/A(slow)) in the kinetics of the dark relaxation of variable chlorophyll fluorescence (F-V) was studied after various periods of illumination of dark-adapted primary barley leaves. Simultaneously, photosynthetic activity was monitored using the photoacoustic technique and the photochemical and non-photochemical fluorescence quenching parameters. The ratio A(fast)/A(slow) changed with the preceding illumination time in a two-step manner. During the first stage of photosynthetic induction (0-20 s of illumination), characterized by a drop in O-2-dependent photoacoustic signal following an initial spike and by a relatively stable small value of photochemical F-V quenching, the ratio A(fast)/A(slow) remained practically unaltered. During the second stage (20-60 s of illumination), when both the rate of O-2 evolution and the photochemical F-V quenching were found to be sharply developed, a marked increase in the above ratio was also observed. A linear correlation was found between the value of the photochemical quenching and the ratio A(fast)/A(slow) during the second phase of photosynthetic induction. It is concluded that the slow phase appearing in the kinetics of F-V dark relaxation is not due to the existence of Photosystem II reaction centres lacking the ability to reduce P700(+) with high rates, but is instead related to the limitation of electron release from Photosystem I during the initial stage of the induction period of photosynthesis. This limitation keeps the intersystem electron carriers in the reduced state and thus increases the probability of back electron transfer from Q(A)(-) to the donor side of Photosystem II.									15	2	0	0	10	0	16			0166-8595			WOS:A1996UE16800002	24301703

Here, we generated the transcriptomes of Gynaephora menyuanensis and G. alpherakii, inhabiting different high altitudes on the TP, and used these and the previously available transcriptomic and genomic sequences from low-altitude insects to explore potential genetic basis for divergent high-altitude adaptation in Gynaephora. An analysis of 5,869 orthologous genes among Gynaephora and other three low-altitude insects uncovered that fast-evolving genes and positively selected genes (PSGs) in the two Gynaephora species were enriched in energy metabolism and hypoxia response categories (e.g. mitochondrion, oxidation-reduction process, and response to oxidative stress). Particularly, mTOR signaling pathway involving hypoxia was enriched by PSGs, indicating this well-known pathway in mammal hypoxia adaptation may be an important signaling system in Gynaephora. Furthermore, some PSGs were associated with response to hypoxia (e.g. cytochrome proteins), cold (e.g. dehydrogenase) and DNA repair (e.g. DNA repair proteins). Interestingly, several insect-specific genes that were associated with exoskeleton and cuticle development (e.g. chitinase and ecdysteroids) had experienced positive selection, suggesting the specific adaptive mechanisms in insects. This study is favourable for understanding the adaptive evolution of Gynaephora and even TP insects to divergent altitudes.									10	2	0	0	9	0	12			2045-2322			WOS:000417051000022	29208990

The Cu-Pd system is interesting as a model system for corrosion as well as a potential catalyst material. We report a combined in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and ex-situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) study of the initial structural evolution during the selective dissolution of Cu from Cu3Pd (111) and Cu3Pd (100). The experiments were performed under potential control in 0.1 M H2SO4 solution. Below the critical potential, no distinct diffraction signal is evidenced by in-situ XRD but AFM reveals the existence of islands on the surfaces. At the critical potential, on both single crystal surfaces the formation of an epitaxial Pd layer exhibiting substrate orientation is evidenced by XRD. Ex-situ AFM imaging clearly showed at comparable stages the formation of larger nanoscale islands. We further compare and contrast the behavior of the dealloyed Cu-Pd surfaces with that of Cu-Au alloys. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

It is one of the challenges to understand the relationship between the PEC performance and the composite ratio of Bi/BiOCl, and the density functional theory calculation results show that charges obviously transfer from the Bi cluster to the BiOCl (001) surface. The structure of Bi/BiOCl photocathode has been successfully optimized, according to the current-potential curves and charge injection efficiency. The highly enhanced PEC activity could be attributed to the dual roles of Bi nanoparticles in enhancing the charge transfer and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect. More importantly, the optimal Bi/BiOCl photocathode achieved a solar hydrogen evolution rate of 2.4 mu mol h(-1) under full spectrum illumination (100 mW cm(-2)).									79	1	0	0	4	0	79			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000396146900018		
J	Ellermann-Eriksen, Svend								Macrophages and cytokines in the early defence against herpes simplex virus								VIROLOGY JOURNAL				2						59	10.1186/1743-422X-2-59				2005	2005	Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 and 2 are old viruses, with a history of evolution shared with humans. Thus, it is generally well-adapted viruses, infecting many of us without doing much harm, and with the capacity to hide in our neurons for life. In rare situations, however, the primary infection becomes generalized or involves the brain.Normally, the primary HSV infection is asymptomatic, and a crucial element in the early restriction of virus replication and thus avoidance of symptoms from the infection is the concerted action of different arms of the innate immune response. An early and light struggle inhibiting some HSV replication will spare the host from the real war against huge amounts of virus later in infection. As far as such a war will jeopardize the life of the host, it will be in both interests, including the virus, to settle the conflict amicably. Some important weapons of the unspecific defence and the early strikes and beginning battle during the first days of a HSV infection are discussed in this review.Generally, macrophages are orchestrating a multitude of anti-herpetic actions during the first hours of the attack. In a first wave of responses, cytokines, primarily type I interferons (IFN) and tumour necrosis factor are produced and exert a direct antiviral effect and activate the macrophages themselves. In the next wave, interleukin (IL)-12 together with the above and other cytokines induce production of IFN-gamma in mainly NK cells. Many positive feed-back mechanisms and synergistic interactions intensify these systems and give rise to heavy antiviral weapons such as reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide. This results in the generation of an alliance against the viral enemy.However, these heavy weapons have to be controlled to avoid too much harm to the host. By IL4 and others, these reactions are hampered, but they are still allowed in foci of HSV replication, thus focusing the activity to only relevant sites. So, no hero does it alone. Rather, an alliance of cytokines, macrophages and other cells seems to play a central role. Implications of this for future treatment modalities are shortly considered.									81	2	7	0	69	1	93				1743-422X		WOS:000208519000059	16076403	
J	Iben, I; Tutukov, AV; Fedorova, AV				Tutukov, Alexander/AAY-5487-2021				On the evolution of low-mass X-ray binaries under the influence of a donor stellar wind induced by X-rays from the accretor								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				486	2			955	986						SEP 10 1997	1997	In a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB), an intense stellar wind from the mass donor may be a consequence of the absorption of X-rays from the mass-accreting neutron star or black hole, and such a wind could change the evolution of these binaries dramatically compared with the evolution of cataclysmic variables (CVs), which are close binaries in which the accretor is a white dwarf. An analytical study and numerical models show that, in the closest and brightest LMXBs, a relativistic companion can capture up to similar to 10% of the mass lost in the induced stellar wind (ISW) from the main-sequence or subgiant donor, and this is enough to keep the X-ray luminosity of a typical LMXB on the level of L-X similar to 5000 L. and to accelerate the rotation of an old neutron star with a low magnetic field into the millisecond-period range. A self-sustained ISW may exist even if the donor does not fill its Roche lobe, but the system can be bright (L-X > 100 L.) only if the radius of the donor is a substantial fraction (greater than or similar to 0.8) of the Roche lobe radius. A lower limit on the Roche lobe filling factor follows from the circumstance that both the rate (E) over dot(wind) at which work must be done to lift wind matter off the donor and the rate (E) over dot(abs) at which the donor absorbs X-ray energy are proportional to (M) over dot(ISW) (the ISW mass-loss rate) and from the requirement that (E) over dot(wind) < (E) over dot(abs) in order for energy to be conserved.The observed number (similar to 100) of bright LMXBs in our Galaxy can be understood as the product of a relatively short lifetime (a few x 10(7) yr) and a small theoretical birthrate (similar to 2 x 10(-6)-8 x 10(-6) yr(-1)), which is comparable to semiempirical estimates of the birthrate of LMXBs and millisecond pulsars (similar to 2 x 10(-6) yr(-1)). The theoretical lifetime is similar to 10-60 times shorter than when the ISW is not taken into account, and the theoretical birthrate is similar to 3-6 times smaller, because of the fact that the ISW acts to expand the orbit and reduce the number of systems that can evolve through an X-ray bright stage under the influence of a magnetic stellar wind (MSW) when the donor is a main-sequence star (CV-like LMXBs), or under the influence of nuclear evolution when the donor is a subgiant or giant with a degenerate helium core (Algol-like LMXBs) of mass in the range M-He = 0.13-0.45 M..The observed concentration of LMXBs in the 3-24 hr orbital period range corresponds to a similar concentration in the CV distribution and could be interpreted as evidence that the MSW in LMXBs operates at a strength not too different from its strength in CVs. For 0.3-1 M. main-sequence donors, if the radius of the donor is larger than similar to 70% of the Roche lobe radius, the tendency of the ISW to force orbital expansion can balance the braking influence of the MSW and prevent an LMXB with a main-sequence donor from evolving to periods less than similar to 3 hr. When a main-sequence donor becomes completely convective (donor mass similar to 0.1-0.3 M., depending on the mass-loss rate) and the MSW shuts off, orbital angular momentum loss due to gravitational wave radiation (GWR) is unable to counter the tendency toward expansion, and this may explain the apparent absence of short-period (P-orb < 3 hr) LMXBs with main-sequence donors. This contrasts with the CV family in which the number of systems in the Galaxy with P-orb similar to 1.3-2 hr (with donor mass less than or equal to 0.3 M. and with evolution driven only by GWR) is larger by a factor of similar to 100 than the number of systems with P-orb > 3 hr.In Algol-like LMXBs in the Galactic disk, the timescale for the evaporation (caused by the ISW) of the donor with a low-mass, degenerate helium core can be smaller than the timescale for the radial expansion of the donor owing to nuclear evolution, and the donor may never fill its Roche lobe. However, if progenitor binaries are initially wide enough, the donor may escape evaporation as a main-sequence star, and significant mass transfer may not occur until the secondary evolves into a giant with a degenerate helium core of large mass and fills its Roche lobe. In globular clusters, as a result of capture and exchange reactions, semidetached Algol-like LMXBs can be formed in which the donor can fill its Roche lobe even when its degenerate helium core is of small mass, and Roche lobe mediated mass transfer driven by the nuclear evolution of the donor can dominate over capture from the ISW.The numerical models formally imply the possible presence in the Galaxy of similar to 10(4) dim (L-X similar to 1-100 L.), long-period LMXBs or radio pulsars with low-mass (similar to 0.05 M.) companions. Since there are few, if any, known observational counterparts of these systems, it is necessary to invoke a mechanism or mechanisms to destroy their formal progenitors. Possible destruction mechanisms include: (1) evaporation driven by the radiation from the rapidly rotating pulsar into which the accretor has been transformed by accretion during the bright LMXB phase, and (2) a dynamical instability arising when the donor is almost completely convective and fills its Roche lobe. In the case of dynamical disruption, the donor may be transformed into the envelope of a Thorne-Zytkow (1975) object with a neutron star or black hole core or into a planet-forming disk around the neutron star or black hole.A few short-period (P-orb < 3 hr) LMXBs do exist, and, in them, the donor may be a helium white dwarf of mass less than similar to 0.09 M.. An ISW operating before the donor fills its Roche lobe may be responsible for reducing the mass of the white dwarf from an initial value of greater than or equal to 0.13 M. to a value of less than or equal to 0.09 M., thus permitting stable mass exchange (at a rate smaller than the Eddington limiting rate) and evolution to longer periods to occur after the donor fills its Roche lobe. Another scenario relies on the collapse of a massive oxygen-neon white dwarf, which has accreted from a Roche lobe filling helium white dwarf.Problems that must be explored further in order to acquire a better understanding of the evolution of LMXBs include the formation of a corona around an irradiated low-mass main-sequence or degenerate dwarf star, accretion of ISW matter by a neutron star or black hole companion, the effect of an ISW on the MSW, formation of millisecond pulsars, complete evaporation of low-mass donors, disruption by tidal forces of a low-mass main-sequence star or a degenerate dwarf companion into a gas disk around the accretor, and the formation of planetary systems in the disk, around neutron stars and or black holes in post-LMXB systems.									36	0	1	0	0	0	37			0004-637X			WOS:A1997XX17300030

Trimethylborate B(OCH(3))(3) (TMB) was used to introduce B(2)O(3) into the hybrid matrix. The resulting gels were pyrolysed in a N(2) atmosphere in the temperature interval 600-1100 degrees C. The structural evolution during pyrolysis of the hybrids was followed by FTIR, (29)Si MAS NMR, (11)B echo MAS NMR and XRD analysis. The morphology of the multicomponent materials was investigated by scanning electron microscopy. The structures of the hybrid gels and resulting Si-O-C-B glasses depend on the concentration Of modifying boron ions and the amount of organic precursor used in the synthesis. The FTIR, (29)Si charge polarised (CP) MAS NMR and (11)B MAS NMR results show the formation of Si-O-B linkages and Si-C links in the glasses-for both systems. FTIR and (29)Si CP/MAS NMR spectra obtained after pyrolysis at 1100 degrees C show a profile typical of art oxycarbide structure, in which a small amount of boron is incorporated via B-O-Si linkages.					10th ESG Conference/84th Annual Meeting of theDeutsche-Glastechnisch-Gesellschaft10th ESG Conference/84th Annual Meeting of theDeutsche-Glastechnisch-Gesellschaft	SEP 30, 2009SEP 30, 2009		Frankfurt, GERMANYFrankfurt, GERMANY	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1753-3546			WOS:000272026700008

Melatonin synthesis genes N-acetylserotonin methyltransferases evolved into caffeic acid O-methyltransferases and both assisted in plant terrestrialization								JOURNAL OF PINEAL RESEARCH				71	3					e12737	10.1111/jpi.12737		SEP 2021		OCT 2021	2021	Terrestrialization is one of the most momentous events in the history of plant life, which leads to the subsequent evolution of plant diversity. The transition species, in this process, had to acquire a range of adaptive mechanisms to cope with the harsh features of terrestrial environments compared to that of aquatic habitat. As an ancient antioxidant, a leading regulator of ROS signaling or homeostasis, and a presumed plant master regulator, melatonin likely assisted plants transition to land and their adaption to terrestrial ecosystems. N-acetylserotonin methyltransferases (ASMT) and caffeic acid O-methyltransferases (COMT), both in the O-methyltransferase (OMT) family, catalyze the core O-methylation reaction in melatonin biosynthesis. How these two enzymes with close relevance evolved in plant evolutionary history and whether they participated in plant terrestrialization remains unknown. Using combined phylogenetic evidence and protein structure analysis, it is revealed that COMT likely evolved from ASMT by gene duplication and subsequent divergence. Newly emergent COMT gained a significantly higher ASMT activity to produce greater amounts of melatonin for immobile plants to acclimate to the stressful land environments after evolving from the more environmentally-stable aquatic conditions. The COMT genes possess more conserved substrate-binding sites at the amino acid level and more open protein conformation compared to ASMT, and getting a new function to catalyze the lignin biosynthesis. This development directly contributed to the dominance of vascular plants among the Earth's flora and prompted plant colonization of land. Thus, ASMT, together with its descendant COMT, might play key roles in plant transition to land. The current study provides new insights into plant terrestrialization with gene duplication contributing to this process along with well-known horizontal gene transfer.									9	0	0	0	5	0	9			0742-3098	1600-079X		WOS:000697780600001	33844336

Herein, novel and crystalline MnxCd1-xS (0 x 1) nanorods were prepared via a facile solvothermal method. By employing an in situ ion exchange process, CuS/Mn0.3Cd0.7S composites were constructed. The prepared catalysts displayed particularly high H-2 evolution performance, with the maximum reaching 106.84 mmol g(-1) h(-1), and 18.32% ( = 420 nm) apparent quantum efficiency (AQE). The characterization results confirmed that the Mn0.3Cd0.7S nanorods and the heterojunction at the contact interface of CuS and Mn0.3Cd0.7S were the origin of such fine H-2 production. Furthermore, deactivation of the studied catalysts were explored profoundly.									37	1	0	0	3	0	37			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000462662100009

Herein, we demonstrate the construction of 0D-2D nickel-doped and Ti3C2TX MXene (MN)-encapsulated transition metal chalcogenide quantum dot (TMC QD:Ni)/Ti3C2TX MN heterostructures via an elaborate electrostatic self-assembly strategy. The mechanistic studies revealed that the defects induced by atomic-level foreign metal ion doping create a mid-bandgap state, which broadens the optical absorption range and extends the photo-excited carrier lifetime of the TMC QDs. The density functional calculation results verified that Ni2+ ion doping introduces a donor impurity level and increases the density of state at the valence band maximum, leading to a significant increase in the number of active sites and lower energy barrier for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The subsequent self-assembly of TMC QDs:Ni on the Ti3C2TX MN framework further accelerates the charge separation and transfer due to the formation of an ideal unidirectional electron migration pathway by Ti3C2TX MN, which functions as an electron-withdrawing mediator. The synergistic effect of Ni2+ ion doping and Ti3C2TX MN decoration significantly decreases the charge transfer resistance at the photosensitizer (TMC QD)/co-catalyst (Ti3C2TX MN) interface and promotes the chemisorption of protons on the catalyst surface, resulting in an excellent solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency. Our work provides valuable guidance for the rational design of high-efficiency photocatalysts via precise atomic-level metal ion doping and co-catalyst modulation towards emerging artificial photosynthesis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000802125900001

Nevertheless, the effects of site-occupancy disorder on the functional properties of materials are difficult to predict and consequently many experimental trials may be required before achieving enhanced photocatalytic activity. Here, first-principles methods are employed to estimate the mixing free energy and the structural and electronic properties of (GaP)(x) (ZnS)1-x solid solutions. The method relies on a multi-configurational supercell approach that takes into account the configurational and vibrational contributions to the free energy. Phase competition among the zinc-blende and wurtzite polymorphs is also considered. Overall excellent agreement with the available experimental data is demonstrated, namely: 1) zinc-blende is energetically most favorable, 2) the solid solution energy band gap lies within the 2-3eV range, and 3) the energy band gap of the solid solution is direct for compositions x75%. It is found that at ambient conditions, (GaP)(x) (ZnS)1-x solid solutions with x approximate to 25%, 50% and 75% render promising hydrogen evolution photocatalysts for water splitting under visible light, owing to their favorable energy band gaps and band levels relative to vacuum.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2513-0390		WOS:000459963600002

Four kinds of organic bases, 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine (TMG), 4-dimethylaminopyridine, triethylamine, and 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene (TBD) were explored for accelerating Michael addition polymerization of malononitrile and 1,4-butandiol diacrylate. TMG can promote the polymerization efficiently under mild conditions to quantitatively afford polyester with high-molecular weight and moderate polydispersity. The comparison of the kinetic studies of TMG and TBD reveals that TMG shows better catalytic performance, while the catalysis of TBD brings about oligomers in spite of the higher efficiency at early age of the polymerization. Moreover, other diacrylate compounds could also be quantitatively polymerized to afford polyesters with high molecular weight. When dimethacrylate is chose as the monomer, the polymerization becomes sluggish. All the afforded polyesters display programmable thermal and mechanical properties that are closely related to their chemical structures.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2642-4150	2642-4169		WOS:000629614800001

III-V semiconductors have shown the highest efficiencies for photoelectrochemical water splitting but the prohibitive cost of commercial single-crystalline GaP wafers limit practical use and large-scale application. Here, we report a high-quality GaP photocathode directly grown on a silicon substrate by solid-source molecular beam epitaxy. The photocathode can be stabilized under acidic electrolyte 1 M HClO4 (pH 0) by combining an amorphous TiO2 layer coated with a molybdenum sulphide MoS2 hydrogen evolution catalyst by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Under simulated AM 1.5G solar illumination, the Si/GaP photocathode yielded a maximum photocurrent density of 0.95 (mA cm(-2)) with a proton reduction onset potential of 467 mV versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. The average faradaic efficiency of the Si/GaP photocathode was measured to be over 73.4 +/- 20.2% for over 100 minutes. The photoelectrochemical studies for the Si/GaP photocathode show the potential for widespread deployment of cost-effective photoelectrodes for hydrogen generation.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000464414200056

However, understanding the structural descriptors that determine the activity of Fe-N-x remains vague, and promising strategies to enhance their catalytic activity are still not clear. Herein, we used a high-temperature pyrolysis strategy and post-synthesis acid treatment for the direct growth of a single Fe-N-x site adjacent to graphitic nitrogen for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. This strategy could significantly reduce the amount of pyridinic and pyrrolic N atoms, while graphitic N surrounding the Fe-N-x site predominantly increases. An experimental study combined with density functional theory revealed that the increase in the neighboring graphitic N decreases the number of electrons transferred between CO and the catalyst for FeN4-2N-3 and FeN4-4N-3, which results in the decrease of the adsorption strength of CO and the energy barrier for desorbing CO*. The as-synthesized Fe-N-x neighbored by graphitic nitrogen exhibited maximum faradaic efficiency of 91% at a lower overpotential of 390 mV. Due to the increase in the graphitic N, the catalysts perform efficiently for 35 h without any drop in current density.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2055-6756	2055-6764		WOS:000814243700001	35730675

Ti/SnO2-SbBi electrode was synthetized by a thermal decomposition method using ionic liquid as a precursor solvent. Ti/TiO2-NT/SnO2-SbBi electrode was obtained by a two-step electrochemical anodization, followed by the same process of thermal decomposition. The synthesized electrodes were electrochemically characterized and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Terephthalic acid (TA) experiments showed that Ti/SnO2-SbBi and Ti/TiO2-NT/SnO2-SbBi electrodes formed somewhat higher amounts of hydroxyl radicals (HO center dot) compared with the mesh boron doped diamond (BDD) anode. Electrochemical oxidation experiments were performed using iodinated contrast media (ICM) as model organic contaminants persistent to oxidation. At current density of 50 A m(-2), BDD clearly outperformed the synthesized mixed metal oxide (MMO) electrodes, with 2 to 3-fold higher oxidation rates observed for ICM. However, at 100 and 150 A m(-2), Ti/SnO2-SbBi had similar performance to BDD, whereas Ti/TiO2-NT/SnO2-SbBi yielded even higher oxidation rates. Disappearance of the target ICM was followed by up to 80% removal of adsorbable organic iodide (AOI) for all three materials, further demonstrating iodine cleavage and thus oxidative degradation of ICM mediated by HO center dot. The presence of a TiO2 NT interlayer yielded nearly 4-fold increase in anode stability and dislocated the oxygen evolution reaction by +0.2 V. Thus, TiO2 NT interlayer enhanced electrode stability and service life, and the electrocatalytic activity for the degradation of persistent organic contaminants. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite extensive studies on redox metabolism of Leishmania parasites, a prominent question of why Leishmania adopt this unique redox pathway remains elusive. We have episomally expressed human glutathione reductase (HuGR) in Leishmania donovani (LdGR(+)) and investigated its effect. LdGR(+) strain has slower growth compared to the wild type (Ld) indicating decreased survival ability of the strain. Further, LdGR(+) strain showed enhanced accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and more sensitivity to the anti-leishmanial drug, Miltefosine, inferring increased stress level. In contrast, the expression analyses of genes specific to redox metabolism were increased significantly in LdGR(+) strain compared to wild type. Lower infectivity index of the LdGR(+) strain substantiated the above findings and indicated that the expression of HuGR reduces the stress tolerance ability of the parasite. From molecular docking studies with HuGR, it was observed that oxidized trypanothione (TS2) binds much better than oxidized glutathione (GS2). These results also give us hints that the parasite is losing infectivity potential due to an overall increase in intracellular stress caused with the expression of HuGR, showcasing a possible role of evolutionary pressure on the Leishmania parasites posed by HuGR.

Extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectra of an aqueous solution of 1, 2a, 4, and 5 exhibit well-resolved peaks at the first and second coordination spheres due to the M=O and M=M distances, respectively; the solution-state bond distances were estimated, and they agreed well with the bond distances in the solid-state structures.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000818701100001	35749230

In the period from the beginning of September to October 10, the chlorophyll content was reduced by half, while the Chl a/b ratio increased from 2.9 to 4.3-4.5, indicating the degradation of peripheral antenna complexes. The decrease in average daily temperature to 4.9-6.4 degrees C led to a transient increase in the quantum yield of nonphotochemical quenching (pH-dependent parameter phi NPQ). These changes were accompanied by a slow accumulation of unregulated zeaxanthin fraction insensitive to illumination conditions. The further decrease in average daily temperature to near-zero levels was paralleled by a sharp increase in zeaxanthin content, while the pH-dependent quenching was replaced with the constitutive quenching (parameter phi(f,D)) because of the supposed structural reorganization of PSII. These processes were accompanied by a fast decrease in PSII functional activity, which was mostly due to the impairment of plastoquinone photochemical reduction. Freezing temperatures (from-3.6 to-12.1) destructed the oxygen-evolving complex in PSII and completely inactivated the PSII reaction centers. It is concluded that the largest changes in the condition of photosynthetic apparatus occur at a near-zero temperature range and proceed until complete inactivation of PSII under the action of freezing temperatures.									3	0	0	0	3	0	4			1021-4437	1608-3407		WOS:000445214400005

Carbon obtained in this way shows interesting properties, such as high surface area, electrical conductivity, thermal and chemical stability, and porosity. These characteristics among others, such as a tailored pore size distribution and the possibility of functionalization, lead to an increased use of activated carbons in catalysis. The use of activated carbons from biomass origins is a step forward in the development of more sustainable processes enhancing material recycling and reuse in the frame of a circular economy. In this article, a perspective of different heterogeneous catalysts based on sustainable activated carbon from biomass origins will be analyzed focusing on their properties and catalytic performance for determined energy-related applications. In this way, the article aims to give the reader a scope of the potential of these tailor-made sustainable materials as a support in heterogeneous catalysis and future developments needed to improve catalyst performance. The selected applications are those related with H(2)energy and the production of biomethane for energy through CO(2)methanation.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3				1420-3049		WOS:000554150000001	32650543

The effect of the replacement of Co3O4 by RuO2 on the service life of the coatings was investigated under galvanostatic polarisation at 0.75 A cm(-2) in 0.5 mol dm(-3) H2SO4. The electrode deactivation mechanism, using the oer as the model reaction, was investigated by recording cyclic voltammograms (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) at pre-established times during electrode anodization. The service life showed a strong dependence on electrode composition. Replacement Of CO3O4 by RuO2 led to an increase in the service life of the electrodes when compared to pure Co3O4. Analysis of the behaviour of the EIS and CV parameters made it possible to describe an overall deactivation mechanism. The inductance observed in the high frequency domain showed a dependence on corrosion time and was attributed as having its origin in the complex rugged/porous microstructure of the oxide coatings due to the complex route followed by the charge carriers.

For example, Daniel Arnon's group initially refuted the conclusion of Otto Warburg, the discoverer of a 'chloride effect,' that chloride was a 'coenzyme. ' Their reasoning was that chloride had not been shown to be an essential mineral nutrient of plants. In the case of calcium, the problem was that the first 'calcium effects' had been seen with preparations from cyanobacteria rather than from green plants. While today the status of calcium and chloride as essential participants in the process of water oxidation is rarely disputed, the nature of their involvement still eludes all experimental inquiries. Substantial progress in this respect may come from recent refinements of the application of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy to the study of photosynthetic water oxidation.									36	0	0	0	24	1	35			0166-8595			WOS:000178321400023	16245119

Despite the advantage of ambient pressure XPS being a surface sensitive characterization technique, the ability of differentiating the surface adsorbed species (similar to angstrom scale) and bulk electrolyte (similar to 10 nm scale) in the spectrum depends on the delicate balance between bulk solution concentration (C), surface coverage (theta), bulk liquid layer thickness (L), and inelastic mean free path (lambda) as a function of photon energy. By investigating a model system of gold dissolving in a bromide solution, the connection between theoretical prediction at the atomic resolution and macroscopic observable spectrum is established.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0021-9606	1089-7690		WOS:000557299400003	32752713

However, the reasons for improvement are often subtle and controversial. Upon depositing a CoFe Prussian blue (CoFe-PB) water oxidation catalyst on BiVO4, a large photocurrent increase and onset potential shift (up to 0.8 V) are observed, resulting in a substantially more efficient system with high stability. To elucidate the origin of this enhancement, we used time-resolved spectroscopies to compare the dynamics of photogenerated holes in modified and unmodified BiVO4 films. Even in the absence of strong positive bias, a fast (pre-ms), largely irreversible hole transfer from BiVO4 to CoFe-PB is observed. This process retards recombination, enabling holes to accumulate in the catalyst. Holes in CoFe-PB remain reactive, oxidizing water at a similar rate to holes in pristine BiVO4. CoFe-PB therefore enhances performance by presenting a favorable interface for efficient hole transfer, combined with the catalytic function necessary to drive water oxidation.									47	1	0	0	3	0	47			2380-8195			WOS:000456493100047

However, in some cases, they face premature oxidation a few years after bottling. Scientific reports are, for now, multiparametric and unclear. Polyphenols seem to be an important factor involved in the oxidative stability of white wines, but their role has not yet been completely characterized. The present study aimed to investigate the link between polyphenol content and the emergence of oxidative odors of bottle-aged Chardonnay wines. In order to obtain samples with noticeable differences in polyphenol content, as well as in sensory oxidative notes, wines from two different vintages were used. For each vintage, three levels of must clarification and two wine closures were implemented. Polyphenol content was analyzed chemically, and the oxidative character was assessed sensorially by a trained panel using a specific intensity scale. The results showed significant effects for closure type and turbidity. However, these effects were strongly affected by vintage. Concerning the polyphenol content, a clear difference was also found between vintages, closures and turbidity levels. Significant linear regression models for REDOX scores pointed out Flavon-3-ols as the main negative predictor, and grape reaction product (GRP) as the main positive predictor. The enological implications are discussed.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			2306-5710			WOS:000455141100018

The reaction at the target surface and the composition of the film were analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The Al-Hf coatings deviate distinctively from target composition showing a deficiency in Al. XRD phase analysis shows the synthesis of Al3Hf intermetallic compound for the Al-Hf coatings while the oxide coatings indicate an amorphous matrix and monoclinic HfO2. The coatings were annealed in ambient air up to 1290 degrees C to study the oxidation process. In-situ XRD analysis of the coatings was performed during annealing. The intermetallic phase undergoes phase transformations at temperatures between 700 degrees C and 1100 degrees C, with the formation of a metastable face-centered cubic (fcc) HfO2 simultaneously with the monoclinic polymorph. After this transition period, the cubic phase disappears and the coating stabilizes with two oxide phases: corundum (alpha-Al2O3) and monoclinic HfO2 (m-HfO2). Applying the same treatments to the Al-Hf-O coatings results in a similar evolution with an improvement of crystallinity for the monoclinic HfO2 phase and the crystallization of the fcc HfO2 starting at about 860 degrees C. This phase disappears above 1200 degrees C, where the coating stabilizes with corundum and m-HfO2 phases. The formation of the metastable fcc HfO2 phase is discussed and associated with a deficiency in oxygen during the oxidation process. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, the competitive adsorption between NO and O-2 during the process may decrease the NO-removal activity of g-C3N4. In this study, N vacancies were constructed around Pd-0 nanoparticles through the heat-island effect. The co-existence of N vacancies and Pd-0 nanoparticles created a synergistic effect, which weakened the competitive adsorption between NO and O-2. Moreover, this synergistic effect improved the charge transfer and produced more hydroxyl radicals. As a result, the NO-removal activity of g-C3N4 was significantly improved. This study provided new insights into the design of photocatalysts used to remove gas pollutants through photocatalysis.									6	1	0	0	1	0	7			2051-8153	2051-8161		WOS:000741529300001

In this study, we firstly fabricated Ti/Ir-Ru electrodes by spin coating technique for effective recovery of Cu in electrowinning process. Two different Ti/Ir-Ru electrodes were fabricated using 100 and 500 mM of precursors (i.e., Ir-Ru). SEM-EDX and AFM revealed that Ir and Ru were homogenously distributed on the surface of Ti plate by the spin coating, in particular the electrode prepared by 500 mM showed distinct boundary line between Ir-Ru layer and Ti substrate. XRD, XPS, and cyclic voltamrnetry also revealed that characteristics of IrO2, RuO2, and TiO2 and its electrocatalytic property increased as the concentration of coating precursor increased. Finally, we carried out Cu recovery experiments using two Ti/Ir-Ru as anodes in electrowinning process, showing that both anodes showed a complete removal of Cu (1 and 10 g/L) within 6 h reaction, but much higher kinetic rate constant was obtained by the anode prepared by 500 mM. The findings in this study can provide a fundamental knowledge for surface characteristics of Ti/Ir-Ru electrode prepared by spin coating method and its potential feasibility for effective electrowinning process.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1226-1025	2005-968X		WOS:000502134600013

Nevertheless, its usefulness depends on a previous knowledge of the system metal/media in study. In this work, the evolution of the OCP of cobalt immersed in a carbonate/bicarbonate solution was analyzed by means of a rotatory disc electrode (RDE); the effect of mass transport, and the reactions that can explain the dissolution of the metal in this media were considered. It was observed that the time necessary to reach the stationary value of the OCP is a function of the mass transport. Also, the OCP evolves towards more positive values as the rotation of the electrode is increased. It was confirmed that the corrosion process of the metal is controlled initially by oxygen reduction (cathodic reaction). However, after some time of exposure, i.e. the necessary for the first corrosion products to appear, the formation of a non-passive film of CoO on the surface makes the dissolution of the metal to switch to be anodically-controlled; this process is also controlled by the diffusion of the Co(CO3 )2 2- complex from the metal surface to the bulk of the solution.	El análisis de los transientes de potencial de circuito abierto (PCA) constituye una herramienta útil para la comprensión de la disolución de un metal en medio dado. Sin embargo, su utilidad está supeditada a un conocimiento previo del sistema metal/solución en estudio. La evolución del potencial de circuito abierto en el tiempo del cobalto inmerso en una solución de carbonato/bicarbonato fue analizada teniendo en cuenta el efecto del transporte de masa, mediante un electrodo de disco rotatorio y las reacciones que explican la disolución del metal en dicho medio. Se observó que el tiempo necesario para alcanzar el valor estacionario del PCA es función del transporte de masa y que el PCA evoluciona hacia valores más positivos a medida que se incrementa la rotación de electrodo. Se verificó que el proceso de corrosión del metal es inicialmente controlado por la reacción catódica de reducción de oxígeno; sin embargo, pasado un tiempo de exposición, el necesario para aparecer los primeros productos de corrosión, la disolución del metal pasa a ser controlada anódicamente por la formación de una película no pasiva de CoO sobre la superficie, la cual a su vez es igualmente controlada por la difusión del complejo Co(CO3 )2 2- desde el metal hasta el seno de la solución.								0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2422-2844			SCIELO:S0120-62302006000400002

Atomic force microscopy measurements revealed that numerous particles with a diameter of 100-250 nm were uniformly dispersed on the ITO substrate and the particle size increased when prepared at higher temperature. Cyclic voltammograms of the Co oxide-coated ITO electrodes were measured in alkaline and neutral aqueous solutions to examine their redox characteristics and ability to catalyze water oxidation. When Co oxide was electrodeposited from solutions kept at 10, 25 and 50 degrees C, the amount of electroactive Co oxide per unit area (Gamma(ea)) was 1.06 x 10(-8), 1.72 x 10(-8), and 2.31 x 10(-8) mol cm(-2), respectively. The increase in Gamma(ea) accompanied the increase in particle size observed with rising deposition temperature. Quantitative analyses of O-2 gas produced by water electrolysis were carried out under potentiostatic conditions using these Co oxide-modified electrodes and a bare ITO electrode for comparison. For the Co oxide-coated electrode prepared at 10 degrees C, the amount of O-2 evolved by electrolysis for 2 h at 1.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl was 1.3 x 10(-5) mol cm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte solution and 1.52 x 10(-5) mol cm(-2) in neutral electrolyte solution containing phosphate ions. In addition, when the Co oxide-coated electrode treated at 450 degrees C was used, the amount of 02 evolved by the electrolysis increased to 2.58 x 10(-5) mol cm(-2) in the neutral electrolyte solution containing phosphate ions, resulting from a stable catalytic current.

These TbD1-deleted "modern" lineages are responsible for globally-spread tuberculosis epidemics, whereas TbD1-intact "ancestral" lineages tend to be restricted to specific geographical areas, such as South India and South East Asia (L1) or East Africa (L7). By constructing and characterizing a panel of recombinant TbD1-knock-in and knock-out strains and comparison with clinical isolates, here we show that deletion of TbD1 confers to Mtb a significant increase in resistance to oxidative stress and hypoxia, which correlates with enhanced virulence in selected cellular, guinea pig and C3HeB/FeJ mouse infection models, the latter two mirroring in part the development of hypoxic granulomas in human disease progression. Our results suggest that loss of TbD1 at the origin of the L2/L3/L4 Mtb lineages was a key driver for their global epidemic spread and outstanding evolutionary success.Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) modern strains emerged from a common progenitor after the loss of Mtb-specific deletion 1 region (TbD1).

Isolated single or few metal atoms can be anchored on substrates via chemical bonding or space confinement to maximize atom utilization efficiency. The key challenge lies in precisely regulating the geometric and electronic structure of the active metal centers, thus significantly influencing the catalytic properties. Although several reviews have been published on the preparation, characterization, and application of single-atom catalysts (SACS), the comprehensive understanding of SACs, dual-atom catalysts (DACs), and atomic clusters has never been systematically summarized. Here, recent advances in the engineering of local environments of state-of-the-art SACs, DACs, and atomic clusters for enhanced catalytic performance are highlighted. Firstly, various synthesis approaches for SACs, DACs, and atomic clusters are presented. Then, special attention is focused on the elucidation of local environments in terms of electronic state and coordination structure. Furthermore, a comprehensive summary of isolated single and few atoms for the applications of thermocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis is provided.

Here, we present scanning tunneling microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results for cobalt oxide nanoislands that reveal the detailed atomistic mechanisms leading to transitions between Co-O bilayer and O-Co-O trilayer, induced by oxidation in O-2 and reductive vacuum annealing treatments, respectively. By comparing between two different noble metal substrates, Au(111) and Pt(111), we further address the influence of the substrate. Overall, nanoisland edges act to initiate both the oxidation and reduction processes on both substrates. However, important influences of the choice of substrate were found, as the progress of oxidation includes intermediate steps on Au(111) not observed on Pt(111), where the oxidation on the hand takes place at a significantly higher rate. During reductive treatment of trilayer, the bilayer structure gradually reappears on Pt(111), but not on Au(111) where the reduction rather results in the appearance of a stacked cobalt oxide morphology. These observations point to strong differences in the catalytic behavior between Au and Pt supported cobalt oxides, despite the otherwise strong structural similarities.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			1520-6106			WOS:000423140600020	28800235

We report a fast and easy synthesis of multifunctional materials composed of only fluorescent dots with structural flexibility and high sorption capability. The synthesis consists of a one-pot microwave-assisted reaction for the simultaneous formation of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) from organic precursors and their spontaneous self-assembly forming porous architectures. The GQD-assemblies are robust and no signs of degradation were observed with most organic solvents. The ensuing GQDs and their porous solids were fully characterized at the morphological and optical levels. Interestingly, the solid integrates both the advantages of porous materials and the nanoscale, showing a marked sorption capability towards hazardous electron-deficient triazines (112 mg g(-1) of sorbent). Moreover, it also exhibits optical-responsive properties based on quantum confinement when it is disassembled acting as a fluorometric sensor in alcoholic solutions. Therefore, these properties enable this novel material to became a convenient bifunctional analytical tool not only for the removal of herbicides in apolar organic solvents but also as a chemosensor to monitor their presence in polar media. This work opens very challenging possibilities of creating porous graphene-based networks for contaminant remediation and monitoring.									23	0	0	0	4	0	23			2046-2069			WOS:000443624500051	35547271

However, its degradation activity always suffers from the Fe(III)/Fe(II) cycle. For this reason, graphitic carbon interface-modified g-C3N4 (CUCN) was fabricated to remarkably improve photocatalysis-self-Fenton degradation activity. The experiment results indicated that CUCN-2% photocatalyst, in which the loading percentage of graphitic carbon was 2%, demonstrated the optimum degradation performance among all the counterparts. The mineralization degree for RhB in 3 h over CUCN-2% reached 63.77%, nearly 3.35-fold higher than the pristine g-C3N4. The significantly improved mineralization efficiency was ascribed to the promoted Fe(III)/Fe(II) cycle by photogenerated electrons, which leading to the higher utilization efficiency of H2O2 through Fenton reaction, thereby producing more hydroxyl radicals. It is anticipated that our work could provide new insights for the design of photocatalysis-self-Fenton system with exceptional degradation performance for actual photocatalytic applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1001-0521	1867-7185		WOS:000773863800001		
J	Shi, Yandi; Liao, Fan; Zhu, Wenxiang; Shi, Huixian; Yin, Kui; Shao, Mingwang								Carbon Dots Promote the Performance of Anodized Nickel Passivation Film on Ethanol Oxidation by Enhancing Oxidation of the Intermediate(dagger)								CHINESE JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY				39	5			1199	1204		10.1002/cjoc.20220000665				MAY 2021	2021	Main observation and conclusionEthanol is considered a better fuel than methanol in direct alcohol fuel cells because of the high energy density and low toxicity. Compared with noble metal catalysts, nickel-based catalysts are much cheaper in price. However, present nickel-based catalysts still surfer from some disadvantages such as low activity and high overpotential. In this paper, we show a new and high efficient nickel- based catalyst for ethanol oxidation. A layer of anodized nickel passivation film (Ni-APF) was formed on the surface of nickel sheet by anodic oxidation method with carbon dots (CDs) as co-catalyst. At the current density of 110 mA center dot cm(-2), the potential for Ni-APF/CDs was only 0.541 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), which was 18.8% lower than that of Ni-APF. Low overpotential could reduce electrode thermal loss and increase output energy. Ni-APF/CDs showed 144.4 mA center dot cm(-2) peak current density at peak potential 0.662 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), which was 31% higher than that of Ni-APF (110.3 mA center dot cm(-2)). In this system, CDs mainly function in the increase of charge-transfer capacity and the promotion oxidation of carbonaceous intermediates.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1001-604X	1614-7065		WOS:000645001500019

CXC subfamily and their involvement in disease defense and hypoxia responses								FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY				60				380	390		10.1016/j.fsi.2016.12.004				JAN 2017	2017	Chemokines are a superfamily of structurally related chemotactic cytokines exerting significant roles in regulating cell migration and activation. They are defined by the presence of four conserved cysteine residues and are divided into four subfamilies depending on the arrangement of the first two conserved cysteines residues: CXC, CC, C and CX3C. In this study, a complete set of 17 CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL) genes was systematically identified and characterized from channel catfish genome through data mining of existing genomic resources. Phylogenetic analysis allowed annotation of the 17 CXC chemokines. Extensive comparative genomic analyses supported their annotations and orthologies, revealing the existence of fish -specific CXC chemokines and the expansion of CXC chemokines in the teleost genomes. The analysis of gene expression after bacterial infection indicated the CXC chemokines were expressed in a gene -specific manner. CXCL11.3 and CXCL20.3 were expressed significantly higher in resistant fish than in susceptible fish after ESC infection, while CXCL20.2 were expressed significantly higher in resistant fish than in susceptible fish after columnaris infection. The expression of those CXC chemokines, therefore can be a useful indicator of disease resistance. A similar pattern of expression was observed between resistant and susceptible fish with biotic and abiotic stresses, ESC, columnaris and hypoxia, suggesting that high levels of expression of the majority of CXC chemokines, with exception of CXC11 and CXC20, are detrimental to the host.

Herein, a simple yet robust double-solvent-induced self-assembly strategy is, for the first time, developed to yield supramolecular precursors using a single monomer for crafting one-dimensional (1D), highly porous g-C3N4 microtubes that possess remarkable photocatalytic CO2 conversion performance. Intriguingly, the introduction of water and isopropanol triggers the self-assembly of dicyandiamide under hydrothermal conditions to form a melamine-cyanaurate-like complex (MCC) composed of 1D hexagon-shaped, micron-sized crystals with outstanding thermal stability. Subsequent thermal pyrolysis converts these pillar-like crystals into 1D mesoporous g-C3N4 microtubes (denoted MCNM) comprising well-packed nano-leaf-like frameworks (i.e., hierarchical structure). Such unique microtubes are oxygen-doped g-C3N4 and mechanically stable, exhibiting improved visible-light harvesting ability, enhanced charge transfer, increased active sites, and preferred adsorption and activation for CO2, as revealed by a suite of characterization techniques. Consequently, in sharp contrast to bulk g-C3N4, the MCNM manifests a markedly improved photocatalytic activity with a CO evolution rate of 45.16 timolh(-1), reflecting an 11.0-fold enhancement and an apparent quantum efficiency of 2.55% at 420 nm. As such, the double-solvent-induced self-assembly may stand out an effective route to organized supramolecular precursors for preparing hierarchically structured g-C3N4 for efficient photocatalysis.									38	1	0	0	1	0	38			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000581738300024

Comparative analysis of the blood transcriptomes between wolves and dogs								ANIMAL GENETICS				49	4			291	302		10.1111/age.12675				AUG 2018	2018	Dogs were domesticated by human and originated from wolves. Their evolutionary relationships have attracted much scientific interest due to their genetic affinity but different habitats. To identify the differences between dogs and wolves associated with domestication, we analysed the blood transcriptomes of wolves and dogs by RNA-Seq. We obtained a total of 30.87Gb of raw reads from two dogs and three wolves using RNA-Seq technology. Comparisons of the wolf and dog transcriptomes revealed 524 genes differentially expressed genes between them. We found that some genes related to immune function (DCK, ICAM4, GAPDH and BSG) and aerobic capacity (HBA1, HBA2 and HBB) were more highly expressed in the wolf. Six differentially expressed genes related to the innate immune response (CCL23, TRIM10, DUSP10, RAB27A, CLEC5A and GCH1) were found in the wolf by a Gene Ontology enrichment analysis. Immune system development was also enriched only in the wolf group. The ALAS2, HMBS and FECH genes, shown to be enriched by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis, were associated with the higher aerobic capacity and hypoxia endurance of the wolf. The results suggest that the wolf might have greater resistance to pathogens, hypoxia endurance and aerobic capacity than dogs do.									14	0	1	0	8	0	14			0268-9146	1365-2052		WOS:000438194200003	29953636

Compared with g-C3N4, it was found that Co3O4/g-C3N4 heterojunctions possessed a higher Brunner-Emmet-Teller (BET) surface area, which was beneficial to the diffusion of aim molecules on the electrode surfaces. And the optimal Co3O4/g-C3N4 heterojunctions exhibited a narrower band gap and a higher donor density, resulting in an excellent electrocatalytic activity for environmental phenolic hormones. Moreover, the Co3O4/g-C3N4 heterojunctions were used for the electrochemical sensing of environmental phenolic hormones such as bisphenol A, pentachlorophenol, p-nitrophenol and octylphenol. All detection ranges reached three orders of magnitude, showing a lower limit of detection of 10(-9) mol L-1. So, sensitivity and accurate determination of environmental phenolic hormones in real water samples may use this Co3O4/g-C3N4 heterojunctions modified electrode.

In recent years, the focus has been on the design and synthesis of novel catalytic materials with controlled interface and surface structures. Another goal is to uncover potential catalytic activity and selectivity, as well as understand their fundamental catalytic mechanisms. Scientists have achieved great progress in the experimental and theoretical investigation due to the urgent demand for broad commercialization of fuel cells in automotive applications. However, there are still three main problems: cost, performance, and stability. To meet these targets, the catalyst needs to have multisynergic functions. In addition, the composition and structure changes of the catalysts during the reactions still need to be explored.Activity in catalytic nanomaterials is generally controlled by the size, shape, composition, and interface and surface engineering. As such, one-dimensional nanostructures such as nanowires and nanotubes are of special interest However, these structures tend to lose the nanoparticle morphology and inhibit the use of catalysts in both fuel cell anodes and cathodes. In 2003, Rubinstein and co-workers proposed the idea of nanoparticle nanotubes (NNs), which combine the geometry of nanotubes and the morphology of nanoparticles. This concept gives both the high surface-to-volume ratio and the size effect, which are both appealing in electrocatalyst design.In this Account, we describe our developments in the construction of highly active NNs with unique surface and heterogeneous interface structures. We try to clarify enhanced activity and stability in catalytic systems by taking into account the activity Impact factors. We briefly introduce material structural effects on the electrocatalytic reactivity including metal oxide/metal and metal/metal interfaces, dealloyed pure Pt, and mixed Pt/Pd surfaces. In addition, we discuss the geometric structure and surface composition changes and evolutions on the activity,, selectivity, and stability under fuel cell operation conditions. We expect that these nanostructured materials with particular nanostructured characteristics, physical and chemical properties, and remarkable structure changes will offer new opportunities for wide scientific communities.									201	11	0	0	11	0	202			0001-4842			WOS:000322086600007	23425040

The investigation combined plasma diagnostics by Langmuir probes and zero-dimensional plasma modeling. It was found that the substitution of CF4 for O-2 at constant fraction of Ar in a feed gas produces the non-monotonic change in F atom density, as it was repeatedly reported for the binary CF4/O-2 gas mixtures. At the same time, the substitution of Ar for O-2 at constant fraction of CF4 results in the monotonic increase in F atom density toward more oxygenated plasmas. The natures of these phenomena as well as theirs possible impacts on the etching/polymerization kinetics were discussed in details.									18	0	5	0	0	0	19			0272-4324	1572-8986		WOS:000407131900010

However, the effects of Co valence state and its synergy with graphene substrate are not clear yet. In this work, cobalt porphyrin (CoTPP) molecule with the intrinsic Co-N-4-C moiety is successfully combined with graphene oxide (GO) via three kinds of liquid-phase methods. The ratio of CoTPP to GO and the valence state of Co atom are studied to explore their catalysis for CO2RR to CO. It is found that axially-coordinated Co(III)TPPCl/GO nanocomposites synthesized via a chemical method exhibit better ability for CO2RR, as compared with Co(II)TPP+GO and/or Co(III)TPPCl+GO nanocomposites obtained via a physically mixing way. After optimizing the ratio of CoTPP to GO, the Faradaic efficiency (FE) is more than 90% for CO2RR to CO between -0.7 and -0.8 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in Co(III)TPPCl/G075. The synergy between CoTPP and GO and the effect of Co valence state are systematically investigated, indicating that their strong interaction plays the key role in electrocatalytic CO2RR.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0254-5861			WOS:000797908300003

The catalysts were prepared by thermal decomposition of polymeric precursors, and characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray, and X-ray diffraction. According to cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry experiments, mixed catalysts with different metal compositions and high electrochemical surface area, prepared by thermal decomposition of polymeric precursors, afford higher current densities at low values of potential as compared to the PtOy/Ti electrocatalyst. In addition, the onset potential for the oxidation of glycerol shifts toward less positive values, showing that the mixed electrodes facilitate oxidation as compared to the PtOy/Ti electrocatalyst. Among the tested metal compositions, the Pt0.8Ni0.2Oy/Ti and the Pt0.9Ni0.1Oy/Ti electrocatalysts display the highest electroactivity.									14	1	0	0	1	0	14				2213-3437		WOS:000458768800139

We report here on the synthesis and electrocatalytic properties of interconnected porous nanoflakes of the bimetallic catalyst CoMo2S4. These as-grown CoMo2S4 electrodes show higher electrocatalytic ability as compared to the reference CoMoO6 material, requiring a low OER/HER overpotential of 306/162 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2). We ascribe the excellent catalytic efficiency of our novel nanostructured CoMo2S4 catalyst to the combination of an increased number of active sites, enhanced charge transport properties, and a better contact at the CoMo2S4/electrolyte interface. When interconnected CoMo2S4 is used as a bifunctional catalyst in two-electrode electrolyzer cells, it maintains a voltage of 1.65 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) for at least 10 hours, thus opening a new route for the design of efficient, stable and low-cost catalysts.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2052-1553			WOS:000539265900010

Until fairly recently, the principal role of theory in this field was interpreting experimental results. Over the course of the past decade (roughly the period covered by this review), however, that has begun to change, with theory now frequently leading the design of electrocatalytic materials. Though rewarding, this has not been a particularly easy union. For one thing, experimentalists and theorists have to come to grips with the fact that they rely on different models. Theorists make predictions based on individual, perfect structural models, while experimentalists work with more complex and heterogeneous ensembles of electrocatalysts. As discussed in this review, computational capabilities have improved in recent years, so that theory is better represented by the structures that experimentalists are able to prepare. Likewise, synthetic chemists are able to make ever more complex electrocatalysts with high levels of control, which provide a more extensive palette of materials for testing theory. The goal of this review is to highlight research from the last similar to 10 years that focuses on carefully controlled electrocatalytic experiments which, in combination with theoretical predictions, bring us closer to bridging the gap between real catalysts and computational models.									51	0	0	0	3	0	51			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000509426800007	31657551

It is free of alkaline solution and other additives for directing or supporting in the synthesis procedure. The formation mechanism of this flower-like LDH formed by ultrathin nanosheets is also discussed. Moreover, the as-obtained LDH material shows increased electrocatalytic activity and stability toward WOR in alkaline media compared with the materials prepared without a Ni alkoxide precursor or Fe precursor, namely alpha-Fe2O3 and Ni(OH)(2), respectively. In addition, the electrocatalytic activity is demonstrated to be related to the molar ratio of Fe and Ni in the final Ni-Fe material, and the best activity is achieved when the ratio reaches 0.52 : 1. The phase compositions of the resulting Ni-Fe-x are discussed. Furthermore, the Ni-Fe LDH material reported herein might be employed as a promising noble-metal-free water oxidation catalyst to replace the IrOx material-the state-of-the-art water oxidation catalyst.									76	6	0	0	4	0	77			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000356382500039	26041579	
J	Wang, Lichao; Xiao, Zhaozhong; Liu, Ye; Cao, Shuang; Ma, Zhi; Piao, Lingyu								Mesoporous TiO2 mixed crystals for photocatalytic pure water splitting								SCIENCE CHINA-MATERIALS				63	5			758	768		10.1007/s40843-019-1253-8		MAR 2020		MAY 2020	2020	Semiconductor mesoporous single crystals have attracted considerable attention due to the merits of excellent light absorption ability and large surface area for photocatalysis capability. However, most of the materials have a relative large size (similar to um), which can hardly suppress the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. In this work, we synthesized a series of nano mesoporous TiO2 mixed crystals (brookite and rutile) with high carrier transfer efficiency, improved mass transfer and diffusion abilities, which are crucial for the outstanding photocatalytic performance. Meanwhile, the key factors in the growth process and mechanism of the mesoporous TiO2 mixed crystals were addressed. With the assistance of Pt nanoparticles, H-2 and H2O2 production can be simultaneously achieved and the efficiencies can reach up to 9.46 +/- 0.56 and 3.29 +/- 1.28 mu mol mg(-1) h(-1), respectively. The H-2 evolution rate is 2.8-fold higher than that of the reported TiO2 nanoparticle catalyst (3.34 mu mol mg(-1) h(-1)). The excellent photocatalytic efficiency can be attributed to the special mixed crystal structure of the mesoporous TiO2 crystals. This work provides new ideas and guidance for precise synthesis of nano mesoporous TiO2 mixed crystals and enhancing their water splitting performance with high value-added products.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000520663000001		
J	Valkovskaya, N V								Hypoxia-dependent expression of ADAM8 in human pancreatic cancer cell lines.								Experimental oncology				30	2			129	32						2008-Jun	2008	BACKGROUND: One of the most characteristic features of malignant tissue is the high level of intratumoral hypoxia, which is considered as a powerful factor for induction of tumor aggressiveness and malignant progression. Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a near fatal disease with very unfavorable clinical outcome despite the application of different treatment regimes. It was shown that PC is characterized by high level of hypoxia.AIM: To clarify the correlation between tumor hypoxia and ADAM8 protein expression.MATERIALS AND METHODS: ASPC-1, Panc-1, BxPC-3, Capan-1, MiaPaCa-2, Colo-357, Su8686 and T3M4 cell lines were used in the study. Expression of mRNA ADAM8 was evaluated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. Immunoblot analysis was used to evaluate the expression of ADAM8 protein.RESULTS: Hypoxia induced a 2.5-5.9-fold increase of ADAM8 mRNA levels of in the examined pancreatic cancer cell lines except Panc-1 (p=0.046). On the protein level, hypoxia induced a 1.2-5.9-fold increase of the ADAM8 prodomain removal form (90 kDa) in 5/8 pancreatic cancer cells. Moreover, hypoxia induced a 1.3-2.0-fold increase of the remnant form ADAM8 (60 kDa) in 4/8 pancreatic cancer cell lines: Aspc-1, Colo-357, Panc-1, T3M4.CONCLUSION: It was observed the clear tendency in the increase both of ADAM8 mRNA and ADAM8 protein levels in pancreatic cancer cell lines under hypoxia compared to normal conditions of oxygenation. A potential role of ADAM8 as a hypoxia-dependent protein in the pathogenesis and evolution of pancreatic cancer that is characterized by high level of intratumoral hypoxia can be suggested.									12	0	0	0	11	0	13			1812-9269			MEDLINE:18566576	18566576

These prepared materials were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectra, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The characterization results indicated that the synthesized material was in the form of a duct-like structure and has greater adsorption capacity and photocatalytic ability as compared to traditionally synthesized graphitic carbon nitride materials. The DCN split theACB completely into many intermediates, which were depicted in the HPLC-MS spectrum for knowing the acarbose photo-degrdation pathway. The duct-like morphology of graphitic carbon nitride has improved properties, such as increasing the surface area and decelerating the e(-)/h(+) recombination, which increase the light absorbance ability with enhanced photoactivity.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000422955400001

One of the major advantages of AEM water electrolysis is the replacement of conventional noble metal electrocatalysts with low cost transition metal catalysts. AEM electrolysis is still a developing technology; therefore, with a view to using it to eventually achieve commercially viable hydrogen production, AEM electrolysis requires further investigation and improvements, specifically regarding its power efficiency, membrane stability, robustness, ease of handling, and cost reduction.This review addresses state of the art technology of AEM electrolysis for hydrogen production. It also provides a summary of important research that has been carried out on membranes, electrocatalysts, and ionomers used in AEM electrolyzers, and the performance of such electrolyzers. The aim of this review is to identify gaps in AEM water electrolysis research and to make recommendations for future directions in AEM water electrolysis research.									297	13	0	0	10	1	306			1364-0321			WOS:000417078200008

Identification at the species level and by multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay indicated that all isolates were Enterococcus faecium. The isolates were highly resistant to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, penicillin, streptomycin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin; they were susceptible only to chloramphenicol, linezolid, and nitrofurantoin. Determination of glycopeptide genotype indicated the presence of the vanA gene in all isolates. Molecular typing by pulsed field gel electrophoresis showed that all isolates were closely related. This study is the first molecular characterization of GRE in Colombia.									19	0	0	0	11	4	22			1080-6040	1080-6059		WOS:000177728700014	12194774

Despite the significant number of reports on active catalysts, systematic control of the catalytic activity remains elusive. In this study, descriptors are explored that can be correlated with catalytic activity. [Ru(tpy)(pic)(2)(H2O)](NO3)(2) and [Ru(EtO-tpy)(pic)(2)(H2O)](NO3)(2) (where tpy=2,2 ' : 6 ',2"-terpyridine, EtO-tpy=4 '-(ethoxy)-2,2 ':6 ',2"-terpyridine, pic=4-picoline) are synthesized and characterized by NMR, UV/Vis, EPR, resonance Raman, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and electrochemical analysis. Addition of the ethoxy group increases the catalytic activity in chemically driven and photocatalytic water oxidation. Thus, the effect of the electron-donating group known for the [Ru(tpy)(bpy)(H2O)](2+) family is transferable to architectures with a tpy ligand trans to the Ru-oxo unit. Under catalytic conditions, [Ru(EtO-tpy)(pic)(2)(H2O)](NO3)(2) displays new spectroscopic signals tentatively assigned to a peroxo intermediate. Reaction pathways were analyzed by using DFT calculations. [Ru(EtO-tpy)(pic)(2)(H2O)](NO3)(2) is found to be one of the most active catalysts functioning by a water nucleophilic attack mechanism.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000746512200001	34905663

The Titan's atmosphere seems to be similarly to early Earth atmospheric composition. The exploration of Titan atmosphere was initiated by the exciting results of the Cassini-Huygens mission and obtained results increased the interest about prebiotic atmospheres. Present work is devoted to the role of CO2 in the prebiotic atmosphere chemistry. Most of the laboratory studies of such atmosphere were focused on the chemistry of N-2 + CH4 mixtures. The present work is devoted to the study of the oxygenated volatile species in prebiotic atmosphere, specifically CO2 reactivity. CO2 was introduced to the standard N-2 + CH4 mixture at different mixing ratio up to 5 % CH4 and 3 % CO2. The reaction products were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy. This work shows that CO2 modifies the composition of the gas phase with the detection of oxygenated compounds: CO and others oxides. There is a strong influence of CO2 on increasing concentration other products as cyanide (HCN) and ammonia (NH3).

Initially studied for its ion exchange properties, once the conditions for its synthesis in crystalline form was accomplished by James Stynes and Abraham Clearfield in 1964, numerous other types of studies and applications followed. Extensive studies in the 1960s and 1970s on the thermodynamics of ion exchange led to insights into the intercalation mechanism of this material. The Clearfield group solved the crystal structure in 1968 and refined it in 1977. Powder methods were pioneered by the Clearfield group to solve the structure of this type of materials. In 1968 Giulio Alberti reported means to prepare zirconium phosphonates expanding the chemistry of these layered compounds. New phases of ZrP were also discovered (e.g., gamma, theta, lambda, tau) and the applications ranged from heterogeneous catalysis to intercalation chemistry and solid-state proton conductors. Methods to exfoliate the layers of ZrP were developed in the 1990s as interest grew in new applications of these types of materials. For example, protein and enzyme intercalation was accomplished starting in the 1990s by the McLendon, Mallouk, and Kumar groups. In the early 2000s, the Colon group pioneered the use of the theta phase of ZrP for the direct intercalation of large inorganic metal complexes that could not be directly intercalated into the alpha phase. Initial studies in the ColOn group ranged from applications of these directly intercalated ZrP derivatives in photophysics and photochemistry, amperometric biosensors, vapochromism, and vapoluminescence. Over the past decade, new applications of these materials have been developed in anticancer drug delivery and electrocatalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). ZrP has now proven to be a promising drug nanocarrier and its unique chemical microenvironment provided by the alpha-type layers and the interlayer space enhances catalytic activity for numerous types of reactions. Further elucidation of the catalytic active species under operando conditions as well as the chemical structure of drug-intercalated derivatives should provide new insights that will advance the design and development of new compounds with desired properties. The initial pioneering efforts of Clearfield and Alberti are being continued by numerous research groups providing new exciting areas of development on the chemistry of layered M(IV) phosphate and phosphonate compounds. In this Account we present the efforts of the Colon group during the past decade on studies of the applications of ZrP for anticancer drug delivery and electrocatalysis of the OER.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2643-6728		WOS:000702067100009

The loading of RuO2 on the mesoporous-assembled TiO2 was performed by two methods: (1) incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) (RuO2/TiO2 (IWI)) and (2) single-step sol-gel (SSSG) (RuO2/TiO2 (SSSG)). Among the investigated RuO2/TiO2 (IWI) and RuO2/TiO2 (SSSG) catalysts, 1 mol.% RuO2/TiO2 (SSSG) calcined at 450 degrees C was found to possess relatively high catalytic performance based on the cyclohexene conversion and cyclohexene oxide selectivity. The recyclability of the RuO2/TiO2 (IWI) and RuO2/TiO2 (SSSG) catalysts was also investigated. It was found that after three consecutive catalytic reaction cycles, the RuO2/TiO2 (IWI) exhibited a slight decrease in cyclohexene conversion, but a significant decrease in cyclohexene oxide selectivity. On the other hand, the RuO2/TiO2 (SSSG) exhibited almost unchanged conversion and cyclohexene oxide selectivity, indicating its much higher stability. XRF and TPR results indicate that the high stability of the RuO2/TiO2 (SSSG) is due to the strong metal oxide-support interaction.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			1011-372X			WOS:000277595100011

However, the high cost, low reserves, and poor stability of noble-metal-based catalysts have hindered the large-scale development of renewable energy. Owing to their low cost, earth abundance, high activity, and excellent stability, carbon-based metal-free catalysts (CMFCs) are promising alternatives to precious-metal-based catalysts. Although many synthetic methods based on solution, surface/interface, solid state, and noncovalent chemistries have been developed for producing numerous CMFCs with diverse structures and functionalities, there is still a lack of effective approaches to precisely control the structures of active sites. Therefore, novel chemical approaches are needed for the development of h ighly active and durable CMFCs that are capable of replacing precious-metal catalysts for large-scale applications. Herein, a comprehensive and critical review on chemical approaches to CMFCs is given by summarizing important advancements, current challenges, and future perspectives in this emerging field. Through such a critical review, our understanding of CMFCs and the associated synthetic processes will be significantly increased.									61	8	0	0	1	0	62			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000463970200012	30644998

We fabricate model EC-coated single-crystal TiO2 electrodes and directly probe SC / EC interfaces in situ using two working electrodes to independently monitor and control the potential and current at both the SC and the EC. We discover that redox-active ion-permeable ECs such as Ni(OH)(2) or NiOOH yield 'adaptive' SC / EC junctions where the effective Schottky barrier height changes in situ with the oxidation level of the EC. In contrast, dense, ion-impermeable IrOx ECs yield constant-barrier-height 'buried' junctions. Conversion of dense, thermally deposited NiOx on TiO2 into ion-permeable Ni(OH) 2 or NiOOH correlated with increased apparent photovoltage and fill factor. These results provide new insight into the dynamic behaviour of SC / EC interfaces to guide the design of efficient SC/EC devices. They also illustrate a new class of adaptive semiconductor junctions.									345	11	0	0	34	0	348			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000328942800023	24292419

Electrode position of PtRu alloy on the surface of pyrolysed ZrO2/PANI/ Melamine enhances the catalyst utilization (Pt: 78.4 mu g/cm(2), Ru: 0.57 mu g/cm(2)) in the methanol fuel cell. Pyrolysis of PANI and melamine on ZrO2 forms high porous graphene like structure which is identified by XRD/SEM/TEM. The surface composition and chemical oxidation states of Pt, Ru, Zr, C, N, and O are examined by XPS spectra. The DMFC performance has reached a peak power density of 68 mW/cm(2) in 5 M methanol concentration at 100 C with ultra-low catalyst loading in the anode. Comparing with commercial catalyst, 98% of PtRu usage has been reduced in this method which is first of kind ever reported. (c) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

For a stellar wind of a highly evolved star (post-asymptotic giant branch [post-AGB]), this process would be in addition to what is expected from reactions occurring under thermodynamic equilibrium. A surprising result of that work was that produced in substantial abundance are hydrogenated forms that are hybrids of polycyclic aromatic and polycyclic alkanes. Infrared spectroscopy described here reveals a spectral character for these materials that has much in common with that observed for the constituents of circumstellar clouds of post-AGE stars. It can be demonstrated that a methylene (-CH2-) substructure, as in cycloalkanes, is the likely carrier of the 6.9 mu m band emission of dust that has recently been formed around IRAS 22272+5433, NGC 7027, and CPD -56 8032. Ultraviolet spectroscopy previously done with a lower limit of 190 nm had revealed that this molecular aggregate can contribute to the interstellar extinction feature at 2175 Angstrom. We have now extended our UV spectroscopy of these materials to 110 nm by a vacuum ultraviolet technique. That work, described here, reveals new spectral characteristics and describes how material newly formed during the late stages of stellar evolution could have produced an extinction feature claimed to exist at 1700 Angstrom in the spectrum of HD 145502 and also how the newly formed hydrocarbon material would be transformed/aged in the general interstellar environment. The contribution of this molecular aggregate to the rise in interstellar extinction at wavelengths below 1500 Angstrom is also examined. The panspectral measurements of the materials produced in the laboratory, using plasmas of H, He, N, and O to convert the simple PAH naphthalene to an aggregate of complex species, provide insight into possible molecular structure details of newly formed hydrocarbon-rich interstellar dust and its transformation into aged material that becomes resident in the interstellar medium. Specifically the presence of naphthalene-like and butadiene-like conjugated structures as chromophores for the 2175 Angstrom ultraviolet extinction feature is indicated.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0004-637X			WOS:000087789500027	11543517

Although Ni-Sb-SnO2 electrocatalysts have the highest known faradaic efficiencies for electrochemical ozone production, the activity and selectivity are not yet sufficient for commercial implementation. This work finds that co-doping Ni and Gd increases the ozone selectivity by a factor of three over Ni alone. These findings are the first demonstration of an active dopant other than Ni in SnO2. Electrochemical and physical characterization show that trends in ozone activity are caused by chemical catalysis, not morphology effects, and that conduction band alignment is not a catalytic descriptor for the system. Selective radical quenching experiments and quantum chemistry calculations of thermodynamic energies suggest that the kinetic barriers to form solution-phase intermediates are important for understanding the role of dopants in electrochemical ozone production.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0001-1541	1547-5905		WOS:000708027600001		
J	Korendovych, Ivan, V; DeGrado, William F.								De novo protein design, a retrospective								QUARTERLY REVIEWS OF BIOPHYSICS				53						e3	10.1017/S0033583519000131				2020	2020	Proteins are molecular machines whose function depends on their ability to achieve complex folds with precisely defined structural and dynamic properties. The rational design of proteins from first-principles, or de novo, was once considered to be impossible, but today proteins with a variety of folds and functions have been realized. We review the evolution of the field from its earliest days, placing particular emphasis on how this endeavor has illuminated our understanding of the principles underlying the folding and function of natural proteins, and is informing the design of macromolecules with unprecedented structures and properties. An initial set of milestones in de novo protein design focused on the construction of sequences that folded in water and membranes to adopt folded conformations. The first proteins were designed from first-principles using very simple physical models. As computers became more powerful, the use of the rotamer approximation allowed one to discover amino acid sequences that stabilize the desired fold. As the crystallographic database of protein structures expanded in subsequent years, it became possible to construct proteins by assembling short backbone fragments that frequently recur in Nature. The second set of milestones in de novo design involves the discovery of complex functions. Proteins have been designed to bind a variety of metals, porphyrins, and other cofactors. The design of proteins that catalyze hydrolysis and oxygen-dependent reactions has progressed significantly. However, de novo design of catalysts for energetically demanding reactions, or even proteins that bind with high affinity and specificity to highly functionalized complex polar molecules remains an importnant challenge that is now being achieved. Finally, the protein design contributed significantly to our understanding of membrane protein folding and transport of ions across membranes. The area of membrane protein design, or more generally of biomimetic polymers that function in mixed or non-aqueous environments, is now becoming increasingly possible.									73	2	0	0	40	0	73			0033-5835	1469-8994		WOS:000512322700001	32041676

The vapor absorption spectra and vaporization behavior of mu g-amounts Cd, Zn, Cu, Ag, An, Ni, Co, Fe, Mn and Cr were studied using the UV spectrometer with CCD detector, coupled with a continuum radiation source. The pyrocoated, Ta or W lined tubes, with Ar or He as internal gases, and filter furnace were employed in the comparative experiments. It was found that the kinetics of atomic vapor release changed depending on the specific metal-substrate-gas combination; fast vaporization at the beginning was followed by slower 'tailing.' The absorption continuum, overlapped by black body radiation at longer wavelengths, accompanied the fast vaporization mode for all metals, except Cd and Zn. The highest intensity of the continuum was observed in the pyrocoated tube with Ar. For Cu and Ag the molecular bands overlapped the absorption continuum; the continuum and bands were suppressed in the filter furnace. It is concluded that the exothermal interaction of sample vapor with the material of the tube causes the energy evolution in the gas phase. The emitted heat is dispersed near the tube wall in the protective gas and partially transferred back to the surface of the sample, thus facilitating the vaporization. The increased vapor flow causes over-saturation and gas-phase condensation in the absorption volume at some distance from the wall, where the gas temperature is not affected by the reaction. The condensation is accompanied by the release of phase transition energy via black body radiation and atomic emission. The particles of condensate and molecular clusters cause the scattering of light and molecular absorption; slow decomposition of the products of the sample vapor-substrate reaction produces the 'tailing' of atomic absorption signal. The interaction of graphite with metal vapor or oxygen, formed in the decomposition of metal oxide, is the most probable source of chemical energy, which facilitates the vaporization. Intensity of the process depends on chemical properties of the sample and substrate and efficiency of mass and heat transfer by the protective gas. The discussed mechanism of chemically assisted vapor release signifies the energy exchange between all participants of the vaporization process in ET AAS including the matrix, modifier, purge gas and analyte. The finding contributes in the ET AAS theory regarding the mechanisms of vaporization and mass transfer in the presence of matrix and modifiers. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of the replacement of TiO2 by SnO2 on the service life of the Ti/IrO2 + TiO2 coating was investigated under galvanostatic polarization at 0.8 A cm(-2) in 1.0 mol dm(-3) HClO4. The deactivation mechanism of the electrodes, using OER as the reaction model, was investigated through the periodic recording of voltammetric curves (VC) and impedance spectra (EIS) as a function of the anodization time. Bulk composition and morphology of the electrode coatings were investigated by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) before and after accelerated life tests. The service life showed a dependence on the electrode composition. Replacement of TiO2 by SnO2 in the Ir0.3Ti0.7O2 electrode led to a decrease in the service life of these systems above 30% mol SnO2 content. This behaviour is directly related to morphological factors and the absence of synergetic effects. The behaviour of the parameters supplied by the EIS, VC, SEM, and EDX analyses made it possible to describe the overall deactivation mechanism.									50	4	0	0	1	1	52			0021-891X			WOS:000087171000014

Concurrently to the determination of the optimal implantation conditions, the implanted layers have been characterized using NRS, RBS, NBS and CEMS techniques. The use of TRIMDYN and COLLIS codes, adapted versions of TRIM code, has allowed simulation of the implanted ion distributions at high doses and calculation of sputtering yields. An examination of the Ti profile evolutions, has led to propose a primary recoil mixing based model. The analysis of incorporated carbon and oxygen into the implanted surface has clearly shown a competition phenomenon between these two elements. CEMS analysis has confirmed the Fe-Ti-C amorphous phase formation. Tribological tests have shown a wear and friction coefficient reduction for the treated M2 steel surface.

The mechanically activated carbide-containing composites were calcined in an inert medium at 800 degrees C. The composites were examined by a range of physical methods. It was shown that the mechanically activated composite consists of molybdenum carbide, iron oxide and iron carbide (about 4-8% according to AES-ICP). The phase addition method was used to determine the quantitative content of Mo2C, which was equal to 7.2 wt% in the calcined sample. Catalytic testing of mechanically activated molybdenum carbide in the partial oxidation of methane showed that the carbide-containing catalyst provides a 48-60% conversion of methane and an 83-85% selectivity for the target product (CO).

In recent years, significant progress has been made in the decarbonization of chemicals such as formate/formic acid (HCOO-/HCOOH) by CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2ER). The traditional approach consists of the cathodic CO2ER coupled to the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Current trends consist of alternative anodic processes, such as glycerol (GLY) electro-oxidation (EOG), as a powerful alternative to the OER because it can noticeably lower the cell voltage. Also, this recent alternative leads to the formation of products in the anode with more economic value than O-2, for example, the fine chemical dihydroxyacetone (DHA). Until now factors other than just the energy savings in the ER cell have been neglected. But these factors, such as the anodic market size, the downstream separation energy demand, etc., have to be contemplated in the whole decarbonization picture. In the present study, we analyze the environmental and economic benefits of the integrated production of HCOO- and DHA by a renewable-driven CO2RP in which the traditional OER is substituted by the EOG alternative. Life Cycle Thinking was used to support the decision-making. HCOO- and DHA fossil routes as well as the traditional decarbonization OER scheme (that decarbonized the amount of HCOO-) were used for benchmarking. The integrated production in the proposed CO2RP is highly limited by the small market size of DHA compared to that of HCOO- and also by the high energy requirements in the DHA purification step. Anodic DHA concentration over 1.5 wt% is compulsory in short-mid-term developments to achieve a positive decarbonization scenario wherein the integrated production of DHA and HCOO- is compared with the traditional route. A noticeable reduction in the market price of DHA would be possible with appropriate anode developments. In addition, we evaluate the influence of the renewable electricity market forecast in the economic figures of DHA and HCOO- produced by the co-electrolysis technology.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000664137100001		
J	Liu, Yakun; Mungall, James E.; Ames, Doreen E.								Hydrothermal Redistribution and Local Enrichment of Platinum Group Elements in the Tootoo and Mequillon Magmatic Sulfide Deposits, South Raglan Trend, Cape Smith Belt, New Quebec Orogen								ECONOMIC GEOLOGY				111	2			467	485		10.2113/econgeo.111.2.467				MAR-APR 2016	2016	The Tootoo and Mequillon Ni-Cu-Pt-Pd deposits in the South Raglan Trend of the New Quebec orogen host significant but as yet unexploited nickel-copper-platinum group element (PGE) mineralization within the mafic-ultramafic rocks of the Expo Intrusive Suite. The olivine mclagabbronorite host rocks have been pervasively altered to hydrous mineral assemblages dominated by chlorite, tremolite-actinolite, and relict late-magmatic hornblende, characteristic of greenschist facies metamorphism. In greenschist-altered rocks, the PGE are spatially associated with intercumulus blebs and networks of pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, and pentlandite after primary magmatic sulfides. Palladium is significantly enriched in the vicinity of veins associated with local replacement of the early hydrous silicate mineral assemblage by talc, calcite, dolomite, and minor serpentine and disseminated magnetite. The varieties of platinum group minerals (PGM) are similar in samples both with and without carbonate alteration, with platinum hosted exclusively in discrete sperrylite grains, and palladium dominantly hosted by the Pd-Sb intermetallic phases of sudhuryite, ungavaite, and naldrettite, as well as merenskyite, kotulskite, and michenerite. Palladium minerals commonly form composite grains with hessite, altaite, and other PGM. Most of the PGM are hosted by silicate minerals, but some also occur attached to sulfide minerals, and a few PGM grains are completely enclosed within sulfides. In samples disturbed by carbonate alteration, the PGM are present in greater abundance and larger size. We suggest that palladium was transferred from massive ores to the net-textured ores via an oxidizing, CO2-hearing, neutral to mildly alkaline fluid capable of mobilizing the semimetals such as antimony as hydroxide complexes. Upon reaching zones where oxygen fugacity was buffered to lower values by an assemblage containing pyrrhotite but not magnetite, antimony in the fluid was reduced to its metallic state, causing coprecipitation of palladium in intermetallic phases. This process appears to have been localized at a reaction front near the outer edges of moderately oxidized carbonate altered domains surrounding carbonate veins. This reaction front has high Pd/Pt whereas lower Pd/Pt ratios are observed in magnetite-hearing, carbonate-altered samples closer to the carbonate veins. PGE grades in the vicinity of carbonate alteration attain levels of potential economic significance, possibly meriting attention as PGE resources distinct from the Ni-Cu-PGE sulfide assemblage extracted by current beneficiation practices in nearby deposits. If the magnetite-free, carbonate-altered lithofacies can be confirmed by further study to show consistently elevated Pd grades, then it may be possible to improve Pd recoveries.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0361-0128	1554-0774		WOS:000375353700008

Detailed characterizations of the materials were attained by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetry/differential scanning calorimetry (TG/DSC), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and optical spectroscopies. The results showed that the hydroxide precursors and their calcination products are direct solid solutions of excellent crystallinity. SEM observations clearly revealed that morphology of the precursor particles is controllable by regulating hydrothermal pH and the precursors present preferable homogeneity and dispersion. TG/DSC analysis found that the precursor decomposes via dehydration and dehydroxylation upon heating in the air. Photoluminescence analysis showed that the (La0.95Eu0.05)(2)O2SO4 phosphors have their strongest red emissions at 620 nm under 280 nm ultraviolet light excitation that correspond to the D-5(0)-> F-7(2) transition of Eu3+. Luminescence properties of the phosphors exhibit obvious dependence upon particle morphology and calcination temperature. The factors that affect luminescent properties, including phase evolution, annealing temperature, and particle morphology, were also investigated in detail. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

Approximately 14,000 unigenes were recovered in roots and 3-week-old nodules of each of the two species. A transcriptomic array was designed to monitor changes in expression levels between roots and nodules, enabling the identification of up-and downregulated genes as well as root-and nodule-specific genes. The expression levels of several genes emblematic of symbiosis were confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. As expected, several genes related to carbon and nitrogen exchange, defense against pathogens, or stress resistance were strongly regulated. Furthermore, homolog genes of the common and nodule-specific signaling pathways known in legumes were identified in the two actinorhizal symbiotic plants. The conservation of the host plant signaling pathway is all the more surprising in light of the lack of canonical nod genes in the genomes of its bacterial symbiont, Frankia. The evolutionary pattern emerging from these studies reinforces the hypothesis of a common genetic ancestor of the Fabid (Eurosid I) nodulating clade with a genetic predisposition for nodulation.									81	0	1	0	78	0	82			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000291146800022	21464474

Herein, a dual-functional Nb-doped NiFe phosphide nanosheet catalyst with a low cost and high stability was successfully prepared on nickel foam (NF) pretreated with dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasmas (PNF) operated under ambient conditions. The resulting Ni12P5-Fe2P-NbP layered nanosheets on the PNF show exceptional catalytic performances, evidenced by their low overpotentials for delivering current densities of 100 and 400 mA cm(-2) (j(100)/j(400)) of only 178 and 265 mV for the HER, and 280 and 330 mV for the OER, as well as the small Tafel slope values of 52 (HER) and 59 (OER) mV dec(-1), respectively. The catalyst also exhibits a good electrocatalytic durability and stability during 100 h continuous HER and OER tests at j(300). Moreover, the current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) are achieved at low cell voltages of 1.51 and 1.65 V, thus outperforming most of the reported electrocatalysts in two-electrode alkaline water electrolyzers. Numerical simulation analysis shows that the Ni and Nb atoms in the Ni12P5-Fe2P-NbP nanostructures are the key factors responsible for the achieved excellent performance in water electrolysis.									20	1	0	0	0	0	19			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000638298000001

Towards practical applications of photocatalysis, exploring competing semiconductor materials is a critical challenge. Herein, hollow carbon nitride microspheres (HCNMS) were synthesized via a template-free hydrothermal approach, in which -OH groups (OH-HCNMS) were used for further tuning the surface features. Their properties were thoroughly investigated by a number of advanced characterization methods. The as-prepared HCNMS achieved an impressive p-hydroxybenzoic acid (HBA) degradation rate of 0.013 min(-1), which was 4.3 times higher than pristine carbon nitride (C3N4), even higher than some heterostructured or noble metal modified C3N4. The enhanced photooxidation activity of HCNMS was achieved because of the optimized band structure and the deepened valence band edge, as unveiled by both experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results. In addition, OH-HCNMS exhibited an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 3.7% at 420 nm. The improved hydrogen efficiency of OH-HCNMS was ascribed to the surface functionalized -OH groups, which react with holes, and release more electrons to participate the water splitting, as well as the modified orbital configuration which facilitates the faster charge carrier transfer.									36	3	0	0	4	0	37			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000499066900012

Effects of hydrocarbon impurities, vibrational relaxation, and boundary-layer-induced pressure rise on the ignition of H-2-O-2-Ar mixtures behind reflected shock waves								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				46	14			9580	9594		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.12.112		FEB 2021		FEB 24 2021	2021	The results of an experimental and theoretical study of the ignition of H-2-O-2-Ar mixtures behind reflected shock waves are reported. The experiments are performed with mixtures containing from 0.15 to 8.0% H-2 and from 0.75 to 2.0% O-2 at temperatures of 980-1800 K and a total gas concentration of (1.0 +/- 0.1) x 10(-5) mol/cm(3). The progress of the process is monitored by recording the time evolution of the pressure behind the reflected shock wave and the intensity of the chemiluminescence of electronically excited OH* radicals (lambda = 308 +/- 2.5 nm). A numerical model capable of predicting the effects of additional factors, such as hydrocarbon impurities, the vibrational relaxation of the test mixture, and boundary-layer-induced pressure rise, is developed and used to simulate our own and published experimental data on the ignition of H-2-O-2-Ar mixtures. It is demonstrated that the best agreement between experimental and theoretical results is achieved when all the additional factors are taken into account. A sensitivity analysis shows that the effects of the vibrational relaxation of the test mixture and the presence of hydrocarbon impurities are significant only for lean mixtures, whereas the influence of the boundary-layer-induced pressure rise is important across a wide range of stoichiometries at long ignition delay times. Additionally, an analytical model is developed, which takes into account the finite time of the chain-propagation reactions O + H-2 and OH + H-2. The predictions of the numerical and analytical models are demonstrated to be in close agreement for a wide range of mixture compositions and experimental conditions.

Based on various physical properties, it was confirmed that there are two phases, M-3(PO4)(2) and M2P2O7, in which a similar phase equilibrium energy coexists. These colored powders showed UV and visible light responses suitable to our aim of developing 365-nm light-response photocatalysts for overall water-splitting. The photocatalytic performance of Ni-2(PO4)(3)-Ni2P2O7 MPC showed negligible or no activity toward H-2 evolution. However, Co-2(PO4)(3)-Co2P2O7 MPC and Cu-3(PO4)(2)-Cu2P2O7 MPC were determined as interesting materials because of their ability to absorb visible light within a suitable band. Moreover, an internal interface charge transfer was suggested to occur that would lower the recombination rate of electrons and holes. For Cu-3(PO4)(2)-Cu2P2O7 MPC, the charge separation between the electron and hole was advantageously achieved, a water-splitting reaction was promoted, and hydrogen generation was considerably increased. The performance of a catalyst depended on the nature of the active metal added. In addition, the performance of the catalyst was improved when electrons migrated between the inter-phases despite the lack of a heterojunction with other crystals.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2073-4344			WOS:000478652600053

Particular attention was paid to the reaction mechanisms and the dye degradation pathway in the system. The removal of AO7 in the system was mainly dependent on the oxidation by the produced active substances (center dot OH, etc.) and the coagulation by Fe(II) or Fe(III) dissolved from the anode. The former mechanism was predominant. A possible pathway for AO7 degradation was proposed by monitoring the temporal evolution of intermediates in the solution, with the use of some techniques including GC/MS, FTIR and HPLC. The AO7 molecule was observed to be firstly decomposed to aromatic intermediates, further degraded to ring opening products and finally mineralized to CO(2), H(2)O and inorganic salts. The intermediates increased the biodegradability of the wastewater, which was proved by the increase of the BOD/COD value after electrolysis treatment. The three-dimensional electrode method can be considered an effective alternative to dye wastewater pretreatment prior to the biological process. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

During a similar time frame, higher mammals lost the ability to synthesize another important radical scavenger, ascorbic acid (AA), leading to the suggestion that UA may have replaced AA as an antioxidant. However, in vivo treatment with AA does not protect against the development of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), a disease that has been associated with the activity of ONOO- and is inhibited by UA. When compared in vitro, UA and AA were found to have similar capacities to inhibit the nitrating properties of ONOO-. However UA and AA had different capacities to prevent ONOO--mediated oxidation, especially in the presence of iron ion (Fe3+). While UA at physiological concentrations effectively blocked dihydrorhodamine-123 oxidation in the presence of Fe3+, AA did not, regardless of whether the source of ONOO- was synthetic ONOO-, SIN-1, or RAW 264.7 cells. AA also potentiated lipid peroxidation in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, the superior protective properties of UA in EAE may be related to its ability to neutralize the oxidative properties of ONOO- in the presence of free iron ions.

Outward mixing during the second dredge-up phase and other properties of a 10.5 M-circle dot model star								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				489	2			772	790						NOV 10 1997	1997	A 10.5 M., model of Population I composition is evolved from the main sequence through the core carbon-burning phase. As in 9 and 10 Mo models studied in earlier papers of this series, carbon is ignited off center, but more carbon hashes occur before hydrogen is reignited and carbon burning dies out. Beginning with the second carbon Bash, a carbon-burning flame propagates to the stellar center. The flame is divided into two parts by the flame ''front'' which is defined to coincide with the base of an associated convective shell. Ahead of the front is a ''precursor'' flame in which nuclear energy is converted into heat and the work of expansion at a rate comparable to the rate of release of nuclear energy in the convective shell. The width in mass of the precursor flame relative to the distance of the front from the center varies from similar to 0.01 when the front is at similar to 0.04 M. to similar to 1 as the front reaches similar to 10(-7) M.. Toward the end of the carbon-burning phase, the 10.5 M, model mixes helium-and carbon-rich matter with hydrogen-rich matter, but, in contrast to the other models, mixing does not occur across the base of a hydrogen-rich convective envelope which moves steadily inward through the helium-rich layer below it. Rather, a convective shell extending outward from the burning layers meets with the inward moving base of the convective envelope; then, hydrogen diffuses inward convectively and ignites as carbon and helium are diffusing outward through a region of variable composition. The luminous flux that forces convective motions at the base of the convective region is contributed to by carbon-burning, gravothermal, and helium-burning energy. The mixing process is modeled with a diffusion equation in which the diffusion coefficient is assumed to be a fraction of the local pressure scale height times a convective velocity that is estimated in the mixing-length approximation. When carbon burning dies out, the electron-degenerate core consists of an inner oxygen-neon (ONe) part of mass M-ONe similar to 1.263 M. in which Ne-20 is more abundant than C-12, and an outer carbon-oxygen (CO) layer of mass Delta M-CO similar to 0.0065 M. in which the reverse is true. Over most of the outer similar to 0.005 M. of the CO layer, the abundances of all neon isotopes is much less than 10(-4) by number, and the number abundance of Mg-25 and of other neutron-rich isotopes is equal to the total abundance of CNO elements in the initial main-sequence model. Final interior abundance characteristics in the deep interior of the ONe part of the core are very similar to those in the other models, the principal difference being that the maximum abundance by mass of C-12 in the 10.5 M. model (X-12 similar to 0.006) is significantly smaller than in the 10 M. model (X-12 similar to 0.012) and in the 9 M. model (X-12 similar to 0.048). This has ramifications for the question of the accretion-induced collapse of massive white dwarfs in cataclysmic variables and ultrasoft X-ray sources.									91	0	0	0	0	0	91			0004-637X			WOS:A1997YF30000027

In the field of catalysis, the implementation and quantitative use of in situ procedures are fundamental for a better understanding of the behaviour of catalysts in their environments and operating conditions. By using amicroelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based atmospheric gas cell, we have studied the thermal stability and the reactivity of crystalline cobalt nanostructures with initial 'urchin-like' morphologies sustained by native surface ligands that result from their synthesis reaction. We have evidenced various behaviors of the Co nanostructures that depend on the environment used during the observations. At high temperature under vacuum or in an inert atmosphere, the migration of Co atoms towards the core of the particles is activated and leads to the formation of carbon nanostructures using as a template the initial multipods morphology. In the case of reactive environments, for example, pure oxygen, our investigation allowed to directly monitor the voids formation through the Kirkendall effect. Once the nanostructures were oxidised, it was possible to reduce them back to the metallic phase using a dihydrogen flux. Under a pure hydrogen atmosphere, the sintering of the whole structure occurred, which illustrates the high reactivity of such structures as well as the fundamental role of the present ligands as morphology stabilisers. The last type of environmental study under pure CO and syngas (i.e. a mixture of H-2:CO = 2:1) revealed the metal particles carburisation at high temperature.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0022-2720	1365-2818		WOS:000425665400008	29064561

Single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses revealed that the H(2)bim and M-OH2 moieties act as proton donors in intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Two pK(a) values of 2 (pK(a1) = 9.0 and pK(a2) = 11.3) were spectrophotometrically determined, where the first proton dissociation is assigned to that from H(2)bim and the second is from M-OH2. This assignment was supported by the density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations for two sets of conjugated bases, [Ru(trpy)(Hbim)(OH2)](+) and [Ru(trpy)(H(2)bim)(OH)](+) for the first proton dissociation, and [Ru(trpy)(Hbim)(OH)](+) and [Ru(trpy)(bim)(OH2)](+) for the second dissociation. Electrochemical studies in aqueous solutions under various pH conditions afforded the Pourbaix diagram (potential versus pH diagram) of 2, where the pK(a) values found from the diagram agree well with those determined spectrophotometrically. It was also found that 2 demonstrates four-step proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions to give the four-electron oxidized species, [Ru-IV(trpy)(bim)(O)](2+), without electrostatic charge buildup during the reactions. The multiple PCET ability of 2 would be applicable to various multi-electron oxidation reactions. Catalysis of electrochemical water oxidation was indeed evaluated in the initial attempt to demonstrate multi-electron oxidation reactions, revealing that the water oxidation potential for 2 is lower than that for other ruthenium catalysts, [Ru(trpy)(bpy)(OH2)](2+), [Ru(trpy)(bpm)(OH2)](2+) and [Ru(tmtacn)(bpy)(OH2)](2+) (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine, bpm = 2,2'-bipyrimidine, and tmtacn = 1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane), which are known to be active catalysts for water oxidation.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			1477-9226			WOS:000309615200009	22990387

The resulted nanoparticles were characterized using XRD, UV-Vis DRS, SEM, BET, FTIR, XPS, EDX and PL spectroscopy. The XRD analysis of silver doped ZnO (SZO) nanoparticles confirmed hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO with minimum crystal size about 19 nnn. The doping of Ag in ZnO crystal lattice successfully suppressed the crystal growth of ZnO nanoparticles evidenced by XRD results. The DRS and PL spectra studies revealed that Ag doped ZnO nanoparticles showed absorption in visible light region and charge recombination was efficiently suppressed respectively. The DRS spectra analysis indicated that photon energy band gap Eg for SZO nanoparticles were in the range of 3.27-3.33 eV and reduced with increase in Ag doping. As a novel photocatalyst, the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution was tested by water splitting using ethanol as sacrificial agent under solar light irradiation. The optimal hydrogen evolution rate 805 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) was shown by 6% SZO photocatalyst. This was nearly 54 times higher hydrogen evolution rate as compared to pure ZnO. The improved photocatalytic activity was attributed to small particle size, plasmon band, charge separation and increased surface area. This report clearly revealed the benefit of using Ag doped ZnO catalyst for higher photocatalytic hydrogen generation.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2523-3963	2523-3971		WOS:000473561200046

In this study, multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) modified TiO2 1D/0D heterojunction dispersed in 2D montmorillonite (MMT) nanoclay was designed and fabricated using a facile sol-gel and wet impregnation approach. The samples were characterized by XRD, Raman, FESEM, HRTEM, FTIR, UV-vis and PL-spectroscopy techniques. Dispersing 1D/0D MWCNTs/TiO2 on the 2D MMT structure extends visible light absorption, shorten charges migration distance and provides abundant active sites. The performance of samples was investigated for dynamic photocatalytic H-2 evolution with different sacrificial reagents under visible light irradiations. The MWCNTs/TiO2/MMT heterojunction composite exhibits the highest H-2 evolution rate of 1888 ppm h(-1), which is about 1.49, 3.07 and 7.12 folds higher than MWCNTs/TiO2, MMT/TiO2 and pure TiO2 samples, respectively. Among the different sacrificial reagents, highest H-2 production was obtained using glycerol-water mixture due to the presence of alpha-hydrogen atoms attached to carbon atoms. Next, the photocatalytic turn-over productivity (PTOP) was estimated which demonstrated the molecular H2 production rate with the photon-energy utilization. The maximum PTOP for H-2 production was achieved over MWCNTs/TiO2/MMT heterojunction composite, 5.94 times higher than using bare TiO2 NPs. The improved charges efficiency due to the synergistic effect between MWCNTs/TiO2/MMT in 1D/OD/2D heterojunctions is critical for enhanced and dynamic H-2 evolution. The ternary composite exhibited excellent and stable performance for H-2 production. This study suggests that constructing heterojunction of low cost coupling materials with TiO2 can provide an efficient way for H-2 production under solar energy.									56	2	0	0	3	0	56			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000452782100084

The effect of ZrO2 and CNT concentration on the chemical composition, surface morphology, electrocatalytic activity and corrosion resistance of the composite anode materials was studied by anodic polarization curve (LSV), cyclic voltammetry curve (CV), Tafel curve, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results show that the surface of the electrode modified by CNT (30 g l(-1)) and ZrO2 (10 g l(-1)) has a larger active area and smaller crystallite particles. The formed deposit is flat, dense and crack-free. The electrode has more corrosion resistance. Compared with the stainless steel/alpha-PbO2-ZrO2/beta-PbO2 and the stainless steel/alpha-PbO2-ZrO2/beta-PbO2-ZrO2 (30 g l(-1)) anode, the stainless steel/alpha-PbO2-ZrO2/beta-PbO2-ZrO2 (30 g l(-1))-CNT (10 g l(-1)) anode has a lower oxygen evolution potential, better electrocatalytic activity, and stronger corrosion resistance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2162-8769	2162-8777		WOS:000600930800001

Mechanisms generating a high oxidation potential for water oxidation have been a major focus of photosynthesis research. This potential has not been estimated directly but has been measured by the redox potential of the primary electron acceptor, pheophytin (Phe)a. However, the reported values for Phe a are still controversial. Here, we measured the redox potential of Phe a under physiological conditions (pH 7.0; 25 degrees C) in two cyanobacteria with different special pair chlorophylls (Chls): Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, whose special pair for PS II consists of Chl a, and Acaryochloris marina MBIC 11017, whose special pair for PS II consists of Chl d. We obtained redox potentials of -536 +/- 8 mV for Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and -478 +/- 24 mV for A. marina on PS II complexes in the presence of 1.0 M betaine. The difference in the redox potential of Phe a between the two species closely corresponded with the difference in the light energy absorbed by Chl a versus Chl d. We estimated the potentials of the special pair of PS II to be 1.20 V and 1.18 V for Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (P680) and A. marina (P713), respectively. This clearly indicates conservation in the properties of water-oxidation systems in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms, irrespective of the special-pair chlorophylls.									66	1	5	0	54	1	72			0027-8424			WOS:000275130900115	20142495

Therefore, in this study, a new material for light-driven microswimmers in the form of CoO is introduced. Janus CoO-TiO2 microswimmers powered with low-intensity, UV-free visible light inside water without using any toxic fuels like H2O2 is proposed. The microswimmers show propulsion under full spectrum of visible light with 17 times lower intensity than the mean solar intensity. They propel by breaking down water into oxygen and oxide radicals, which enables their potential applications for photocatalysis and drug delivery. The microswimmers are multiwavelength responsive, from the ultraviolet to the infrared region. The direction of swimming changes with the change in the illumination from the visible to UV light. In addition to being responsive, they are wavelength steerable and exhibit inherent magnetic properties enabling magnetic steering control of the CoO-TiO2 microswimmers. Thus, these microswimmers, which are propelled under low-intensity visible light, have direction-changing capability using light of different wavelengths, and have steering control capability by external magnetic fields, could be used in future potential applications, such as active and local cargo delivery, active photocatalysis, and hydrogen evolution.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000537731900052	32351105

If hydrogen should be considered an energy storage medium rather than a natural resource. However, free hydrogen does not exist on earth. Many techniques for obtaining hydrogen have been proposed. It can be reformulated from conventional hydrocarbon fuels, or obtained directly from water by electrolysis or high-temperature pyrolysis with a heat source such as a nuclear reactor. However, the efficiencies of these methods are low. The direct, heating of water to sufficiently high temperatures for sustaining pyrolysis is very difficult. Pyrolysis occurs when the temperature exceeds 4000degreesC. Thus plasma electrolysis may be a better alternative,it is not only easier to achieve than direct heating, but also appears to produce more hydrogen than ordinary electrolysis, as predicted by Faraday's laws, which is indirect evidence that it produces very high temperatures. We also. observed large amounts of free oxygen generated at the cathode, which is further evidence of direct decomposition, rather than electrolytic decomposition. To achieve the continuous generation of hydrogen with efficiencies exceeding Faraday efficiency, it is necessary to control the surface conditions of the electrode, plasma electrolysis temperature, current density and input voltage. The minimum input voltage required induce the plasma state depends on the density and temperature of the solution, it was estimated as 120V in this study. The lowest electrolyte temperature at which plasma forms is similar to75degreesC. We have observed as much as 80 times more hydrogen generated by plasma electrolysis than by conventional electrolysis at 300V.									44	2	0	0	0	0	45			0021-4922			WOS:000226996600084

The morphology and the optical properties of the Zn(O,5) thin films grown with and without additive have been compared through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations and UV-visible transmission T(lambda) and reflectivity R(lambda) measurements, respectively. It is observed that deposition time shorter than 5 min is sufficient to achieve films with similar properties to those deposited following the standard recipe in 15 min. The characteristics of CIGSe/Zn(O,5) structures for which the Zn(O,5) growth has been interrupted after different bath immersion durations have been investigated by XPS measurements. The evolution of the In3d and Zn2p(3/2) signals reveals that after 2 min of deposition, the Zn(O,5) layer grown by the alternative process completely covers the CIGSe and suggests that the increase of the Zn(O,5) growth rate is most probably due to the acceleration of cluster mechanism growth. A comparative study of devices buffered with the so-called fast and standard Zn(O,S) shows similar efficiencies in either case after light soaking. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Because of different molecular effects reported for this compound, e.g. antioxidative activity, pinoresinol is suggested to cause positive effects on humans. Because experimental data are limited, we have analysed the effects of the lignan on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans: in spite of a strong antioxidative capacity detected in an in vitro assay, no antioxidative effects were detectable in vivo. In analogy to this result, no modulation of the sensitivity against thermal stress was detectable. However, incubation with pinoresinol caused an enhanced nuclear accumulation of the transcription factor DAF-16 (insulin/IGF-like signalling pathway). Using a strain with an enhanced oxidative stress level (mev-1 mutant), we clearly see an increase in stress resistance caused by this lignan, but no change in reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of pinoresinol on the life span of the nematode, but no modulation was found, neither in wild-type nor in mev-1 mutant nematodes. These results suggest that pinoresinol may exert pharmacologically interesting effects via modulation of the insulin-like signalling pathway in C.elegans as well as in other species like mammals due to the evolutionary conservation of this signalling pathway.

These currents transport matter from the nonburning bottom of the convective envelope down to regions where some CNO processing can take place (''coal bottom processing''). Modeling circulation with separate downward and upward streams, we found that, to resolve both discrepancies, the base of the extra mixing had to reach a temperature T-p close to that of the II-burning shell, namely, Delta log T approximate to 0.17 from the base of the H-shell for both RGB and AGE stars. While the envelope composition depends sensitively on T-p, it is insensitive to the speed or geometry of mixing. This indicates that our stream circulation model is generic, so that more sophisticated mixing models with the same T-p would yield similar results. On the AGB, our models predict that stars with low O-18/O-16 can be either S or C stars but must have low C-12/C-13 (similar to 4) and elevated N-14. Cool bottom processing also destroys He-3, so that galactic (D + He-3) decreases with time; this removes the strongest lower limit on the baryon density Omega(b) from big bang nucleosynthesis models.									277	0	0	0	1	0	277			0004-637X			WOS:A1995RF08100010

Herein, we report a novel composite material (labeled as Co-CMP-MWNTs) that consists of a CMP containing Co single-atom catalysts (Co SACs) and being coaxially grafted to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), and show that the material synergistically promotes the cathode reaction kinetics in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The Co-CMPMWNTs are synthesized by coupling 2,4,6-tris(4-ethynylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine to a dibromobipyridine-Co complex in the presence of bromopyrimidinyl-functionalized MWNTs. The composite features a conductive MWNT-based core and a CMP-based shell that contains nitrogen as well as Co. Cs-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy reveal that the Co species exist as single atoms. Additional XANES data coupled with density functional theory calculations elucidate the adsorption interactions formed between the Co SACs and various sulfur species as well as their electrocatalytic effects. Li-S cells prepared using Co-CMP-MWNTs as a cathode host material exhibit excellent performance in terms of specific capacity (1485 mA h g(-1) at 0.1 C), rate capability (602 mA h g-1 at 3 C), and cycling stability (510 mA h g(-1) at 0.5 C after 1000 cycles, which corresponds to a capacity decay of 0.050% per cycle). Collectively, the results demonstrate that SACs can be prepared under benign conditions and used to enhance sulfur cathode reaction kinetics. The methodology described may be extended to enable the use of SACs in other contemporary energy conversion technologies.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000800420400003		
J	Stamatakis, K; Papageorgiou, GC				Stamatakis, Kostas/ABA-4342-2020				The osmolality of the cell suspension regulates phycobilisome-to-photo system I excitation transfers in cyanobacteria								BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-BIOENERGETICS				1506	3			172	181		10.1016/S0005-2728(01)00192-X				NOV 1 2001	2001	The chlorophyll a (Chla) fluorescence of cyanobacteria, which at physiological temperature originates from photosystem (PS) II holochromes, is suppressed in hyperosmotic suspension, and enhanced in hypo-osmotic suspension (G.C. Papageorgiou, A. Alygizaki-Zorba, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1335 (1997) 1-4). We investigated the mechanism of this phenomenon by comparing Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 cells that had been treated with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) in order to inhibit electronic excitation transfers from phycobilisomes (PBS) to Chlas of PSI (A.N. Glazer, Y.M. Gindt, C.F. Chan, K. Sauer, Photosynth. Res. 40 (1994) 167-173) with untreated control cells. The NEM-treated cells were indistinguishable from the control cells with regard to PSII-dependent oxygen evolution, reduction of post-PSII oxidants, and osmotically induced volume changes, but differed in the following properties: (i) they could not photoreduce post-PSI electron acceptors; (ii) they diverted more PBS excitation to PSII; (iii) the rise of Chla fluorescence upon light acclimation of darkened (state 2) cells was smaller; and (iv) the Chla fluorescence of light-acclimated (state 1) cells was insensitive to the cell suspension osmolality. These properties suggest that osmolality regulates the core-mediated excitation coupling between PBS and PSI, possibly by influencing mutual orientation and/or distance between core holochromes (ApcE, ApcD) and PSI holochromes. Thus, in hyper-osmotic suspension, PBS deliver more excitation to PSI (hence less to PSII); in hypo-osmotic cell suspension they deliver less excitation to PSI (hence more to PSII).

Herein, we report the first demonstration of nonmetal TiN as a plasmonic booster to significantly enhancing the PEC water splitting performance of TiO2. A unique multiscaled architecture organized by interweaving hollow microfiber monolith and hierarchical TiN/N-TiO2 nanorod arrays is fabricated by a facile seamless nitridation process. The conductive TiN not only affords plasmon resonance on the N-TiO2 to enable high photoactivity in a broadband UV-vis light region, but also assists in the charge generation-separation-transportation-injection efficiency of TiO2 for enhanced water oxidation kinetics. The TiN/N-TiO2 heterostructure manifests an unprecedented high and durable photocurrent density of 3.12 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) under standard AM 1.5 G illumination and substantiates an outstanding visible-light-driven photocurrent density of 1.63 mA cm(-2) without the use of any hole scavenger and cocatalysts. This study will enrich the fundamental understanding of nonmetal plasmonic effect in and beyond the field of PEC water splitting.									43	1	0	0	1	0	43			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000460495400003

Herein, a TiO2 nanotube arrays (TiO2-NTA) intermediate layer and La-PbO2 catalytic layer were synthesized on a Ti surface by the electrochemical anodic oxidation and electrochemical deposition technology, respectively. The prepared Ti/TiO2-NTA/La-PbO2 electrode was used as an electrocatalytic oxidation anode for pollutant degradation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed that the TiO2-NTA layer possessed a highly ordered and well-aligned nanotube array morphology, and the La-PbO2 layer with angular cone cluster was uniform and tightly bonded. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicated that the intermediate layer primarily consisted of the anatase crystal structure of TiO2 and the catalyst layer was made of La-PbO2. Electrochemical analysis revealed that Ti/TiO2-NTA/La-PbO2 electrode exhibited higher oxidation peak current, electrochemical active surface area, and oxygen evolution potential (OEP, 1.64 V). Using methyl orange and 4-nitrophenol as model pollutants, electrocatalytic properties of the prepared Ti/TiO2-NTA/La-PbO2 electrode were systematically investigated under different conditions, and the electrochemical degradation fitted well with the pseudo-first-order kinetics model. Efficient anodic oxidation of model pollutants was mainly attributed to the indirect oxidation mediated by hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH). The total organic carbon (TOC) removal efficiency of methyl orange and 4-nitrophenol was 70.2 and 72.8%, and low energy consumption (2.50 and 1.89 kWh g(-1)) was achieved after 240 min of electrolysis under the conditions of initial concentration of model pollutant, electrode spacing, and electrolyte concentration were 50 mg L-1, 2 cm, and 0.1 mol L-1, respectively. This work provided a new strategy to develop the high-efficiency electrode for refractory pollutants degradation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0944-1344	1614-7499		WOS:000842888300008	35994150

A one-step chemical kinetics approach was used to model titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) decomposition that leads to homogeneous nucleation and particle formation. The momentum, heat, and mass transfer, Brownian coagulation and diffusion, surface growth, coalescence and thermophoresis have been taken into account. Based on the particle size distributions, an efficient quadrature method of moments was allowed to approximate the general dynamics equation of particle, and the eddy dissipation concept (EDC) combustion model was used to estimate the flame temperature field. Excellent agreements between the model predictions and experimental data, with respect to the flame temperature distribution and particle kinetics, are reached. By taking the particle size and surface area as independent variables, the full distributions of volume equivalent diameters, evolution of the agglomerate number, the geometric standard deviation based on volume and agglomerate fractal nature, mean primary particle size and the number of primary particles per agglomerate are revealed. The variation of oxygen flow rate has an important influence on the temperature distribution and hence on the particle kinetics accordingly.

In this paper, Cu2ZnSnS4/CdS/TiO2, a double-heterojunction photocatalyst fabricated with a TiO2 protection layer and well-matched interface architecture, has been prepared by a multi-step liquid phase process. The chemically inert TiO2 protective layer on the catalyst surface restrained the catalyst photocorrosion induced by formed nascent O-2 and remarkably enhanced the catalyst stability during photocatalytic water splitting. Structural characterization and theoretical simulation indicated that both interfaces between Cu2ZnSnS4-CdS and CdS-TiO2 showed highly well-matched type-II alignment, which was beneficial to the separation and transfer of photoinduced charge pairs. The Cu2ZnSnS4/CdS/TiO2/Pt catalyst under visible light achieved photocatalytic water splitting and the H-2 evolution rate of the catalyst reached 8.76 mu mol g(-1) h(-1). The catalyst activity has been maintained in multi-cycle experiments without significant decay, and its stability has been confirmed by measuring the Cd2+ concentration in the catalyst dispersion using the ICP-OES method. This work can offer a new route to design more stable and efficient Cu2ZnSnS4-based heterostructure materials for solar-driven photocatalytic water splitting to produce H-2.									7	2	0	0	1	0	8			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000675525100001

The obtained hierarchical TiO2 microspheres with diameters of 1 to 2 mu m were composed of polycrystalline anatase nanosheets with thickness of 10 nm. The morphology was manipulated by simply adjusting the molar ratio of tetrabutyl titanate/P123. At a low molar ratio of 17.04, TiO2 microspheres composed of a large number of nanosheets closely packed together were obtained. At a high molar ratio of 34.08, TiO2 hybrid architectures with polycrystalline anatase hierarchical microspheres and single-crystal anatase mesoporous (approximately 5 nm) nanospheres were obtained. Investigations on evolution formation revealed that P123 played a key role in the formation of a well-defined hierarchical structure. The photocatalytic performances of the obtained samples were investigated by the degradation of methylene blue and papermaking wastewater. When compared with commercial P25, the obtained hierarchical TiO2 microspheres exhibit superior photocatalytic activity, high degradation efficiency, and good reproducibility. The product with hybrid architectures exhibited the highest photocatalytic activity. The chemical oxygen demand and the chroma removal rate of papermaking wastewater achieved 85.5 and 100%, respectively, after 12 h of photodegradation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1380-2224	1573-4854		WOS:000413761200001

These outcomes are surveyed for a range of white dwarf masses (0.7-1.1 M-circle dot), accretion rates ((1-7) x 10(-8) M-circle dot yr(-1)), and initial white dwarf temperatures (0.01 and 1 L-circle dot). The results are particularly sensitive to the convection that goes on during the last few minutes before the explosion. Unless this convection maintains a shallow temperature gradient and unless the density is sufficiently high, the accreted helium does not detonate. Below a critical helium ignition density, which we estimate to be (5-10) x 10(5) g cm(-3), either helium novae or helium deflagrations result. The hydrodynamics, nucleosynthesis, light curves, and spectra of a representative sample of detonating and deflagrating models are explored. Some can be quite faint indeed, powered at peak for a few days by the decay of Cr-48 and V-48. Only the hottest, most massive white dwarfs considered with the smallest helium layers, show reasonable agreement with the light curves and spectra of common Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). For the other models, especially those involving lighter white dwarfs, the helium shell mass exceeds 0.05 M-circle dot and the mass of the Ni-56 that is synthesized exceeds 0.01 M-circle dot. These explosions do not look like ordinary SNe Ia or any other frequently observed transient.									204	4	0	0	1	0	204			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000291026900038

Photosystem I, photosystem II, and the cytochrome b(6)f complex still function normally in the petM(-) mutant as judged by cytochrome f re-reduction and oxygen evolution rates. In contrast to the wild type, however, the content of phycobilisomes and photosystem I as determined from 77 K fluorescence spectra is reduced in the petM(-) strain. Furthermore, whereas under anaerobic conditions the kinetics of cytochrome f re-reduction are identical, under aerobic conditions these kinetics are slower in the petM(-) strain. Fluorescence induction measurements indicate that this is due to an increased plastoquinol oxidase activity in the mutant, causing the plastoquinone pool to be in a more oxidized state under aerobic dark conditions. The finding that the activity of the cytochrome b(6)f complex itself is unchanged, whereas the stoichiometry of other protein complexes has altered, suggests an involvement of the PetM subunit in regulatory processes mediated by the cytochrome b(6)f complex.									44	0	0	0	44	0	45			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000168730400026	11278512

In this work, the ZIF-67-derived CoP quantum dot (QD) anchored graphitized carbon skeleton as a co-catalyst is loaded on CdS nanorods (NRs), while the CoP QDs derived from ZIF-67 are anchored to the carbon skeleton under phosphation and carbonization simultaneously. The porous, graphitized carbon skeleton can not only disperse CoP QDs, increasing active sites for the hydrogen reduction reaction, but also provide electron transfer channels, promoting electron transfer and increasing conductivity. In addition, the metallicity of CoP QDs makes it possible to form Schottky junctions, which is beneficial to the electron transfer at the interface. The results show that the composite photocatalyst can extensively improve the photocatalytic activity and stability, the H(2)production rate is 104 947 mu mol h(-1)g(-1)under visible light irradiation (lambda >= 400 nm), up to 55.2 times that of bare CdS NRs, the apparent quantum yield (AQY) reaches a high value of 32.16% at 420 nm, and the structure of the photocatalyst did not change after the reaction. This work provides an innovative method for the preparation of highly efficient noble metal-free photocatalysts for the conversion of solar energy into hydrogen energy, which has bright prospects in industrial application.									26	2	0	0	3	0	26			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000574599500015	32926059

TyrD is stable in its oxidized form, while TyrZ is kinetically competent in the water oxidizing reaction. The temperature dependence of the formation of light-induced tyrosyl radical was studied as a function of pH in Mn-depleted PS 11 from cyanobacteria and plants. Tyrosyl radical formation was observed in the majority of the centers at pH 8.5 and 15 K. The use of two Synechocystis mutants where either TyrZ or TyrD was replaced by a phenylalanine residue allowed a clear demonstration that only TyrD and not TyrZ was oxidized under these conditions. By lowering the pH, the fraction of centers undergoing TyrD oxidation greatly diminished. This pH dependence could be fitted by assuming a single protonable group with a pK(a) of similar to7.6. This pH dependence correlates with the unexpectedly rapid oxidation of TyrD at room temperature [Faller, P., Debus, R. J., Brettel, K., Sugiura, M., Rutherford, A. W., and Boussac, A. (2001) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 98, 14368]. The equally unexpectedly ability to undergo oxidation at cryogenic temperatures reported here, puts limitations on the nature of the protonation reactions associated with electron transfer in this system, raising the possibility of proton tunneling along the hydrogen bond or alternatively the presence of deprotonated TyrD (tyrosinate) prior to oxidation.									60	0	0	0	37	0	60			0006-2960			WOS:000178793100003	12390016

Electron beam Ni-layer deposited LaTiO2N photoanodes for the enhanced photoelectrochemical performance of water oxidation								2017 3rd International Conference on Electrical Information and Communication Technology (EICT)								7 pp.	7 pp.		10.1109/EICT.2017.8275128				2017	2017	Improving the photoconversion efficiency of LaTiO2N photoanodes is crucial in the strong oxidizing conditions and in high overpotential of four-electron water oxidation system. It is essential for electrode to improve simultaneously reduce the recombination, photo/chemical corrosion resistivity and optical losses. In our present study, the photoelectrode has been fabricated by homogeneous CoOx co-catalyst aided by impregnation annealing method and coated with an ultrathin Ni layer by electron beam evaporation method (EB). The fabricated electrode was transferred to a three-electrode photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell system and electrodeposited of cobalt-phosphate (Co-Pi) loading as an oxygen evolution (OER) co-catalyst. The CoPi deposition was fixed and variable the Ni-coating and CoOx co-catalysts for optimization the best results of electrode. The optimal 2 nm Ni coating with 3wt% CoOx-co-catalyst loading on electrode, resulted in significantly enhanced the photocurrent and PEC water oxidation performance. The Ni and CoOx-modified LaTiO2N electrode serve as a highly active O2- evolving photoanode achieving 3.7 mA cm-2 of the photocurrent density at 1.23V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (Vrhe) in 0.2 M K2HPO4 solution (adjusted pH 13 by addition of NaOH) under solar simulator irradiation Airmass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5G). The current-voltage was optimized off all modified electrode and found the maximum solar to energy conversion efficiency is 0.61% with IPCE 35% at 480 nm wavelength at 1 Vrhe. The maximum amounts of evolved O2 and H2 were found 16 and 32 mumol for two hours at 1 Vrhe of optimal technique CoPi-Ni-modified CoOx-LaTiO2N electrode (CoPi/Ni/Co Ox/LaTiO2N/T a/Ti) respectively.

The graphene paper-like films were fabricated by the assembling of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) with the aid of graphene oxides (GOs) as a stabilizer, using a vacuum-assisted filtration method. By using GOs as a stabilizer, the GNP/GO films were fabricated with a paper-like form and they exhibited a highly wrinkled and disordered morphology. Moreover, the use of GNPs as a basic material eliminated the need for a post-annealing to recover the intrinsic electrical conductivity of graphene sheets. Subsequently, the GNP/GO paper could be directly used as a Li-O-2 battery cathode without any conducting additives and binders. The GNP/GO paper electrode showed a much higher discharge capacity in comparison to the reduced-GO paper and commercially available carbon papers. We also found that toroidal Li2O2 mainly nucleated and grew on discharge, and decomposed on charge with a relatively high O-2 evolution/consumption efficiency of 87%. However, a large number of Li2O2 particles grew inside the GNP/GO paper electrode, resulting in severe volume expansion of the electrode. This volume expansion could be the primary reason for the capacity fading on cycling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									62	6	0	0	4	0	63			0008-6223	1873-3891		WOS:000360292100064

High resolution FESEM and TEM imaging reveals that the Si NWs are decorated with ultra-small size arbitrary shaped Si nanocrystals (NCs) due to the lateral etching of the NWs. A strong broad band and tunable visible to near-infrared (NIR) photoluminescence (PL) in the range 1.3-2.4 eV are observed for these Si NWs/NCs at room temperature, depending on the etching conditions. Our studies reveal that the visible-NIR PL intensity is about two orders of magnitude higher and it exhibits faster decay dynamics in the bilayer assisted etching case as compared to the Ag or Au single layer etching case. The enhanced PL in the bimetal case is attributed to the longer length and higher density of the Si NWs/NCs, surface plasmon resonance enhanced absorption by residual bimetal NPs and the enhanced radiative recombination rate. Studies on the time evolution of PL spectral features with laser exposure under ambient conditions and laser power dependence reveal that both the quantum confinement of carriers in Si NCs and the nonbridging oxygen hole defects in the SiOx layer contribute to the tunable PL. Interestingly, Si NWs grown by Ag/Au bilayer assisted etching exhibit enhanced photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue in comparison to Si NWs grown by single layer Ag or Au assisted etching. The Schottky barrier present between bimetallic NPs and nanoporous Si NWs with Si-H bonds facilitates the photocatalytic activity by efficient separation of photogenerated e-h pairs. Our results demonstrate the superiority of the Si NW array grown by bilayer assisted etching for their cutting edge applications in optoelectronics and environmental cleaning.									27	1	0	0	1	0	28			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000372229700015	26907170

Repair processes operate in the cell to replace a damaged D1 subunit within the complex with a newly synthesized copy. As yet, the molecular details of PSII repair are relatively obscure despite the critical importance of this process for maintaining PSII activity and cell viability. We are using the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to identify the various proteases and chaperones involved in D1 turnover in vivo. Two families of proteases are being studied: the FtsH family (four members) of Zn2+-activated nucleotide-dependent proteases; and the HtrA (or DegP) family (three members) of serine-type proteases. In this paper, we report the results of our studies on a triple mutant in which all three copies of the htrA gene family have been inactivated. Growth of the mutant on agar plates was inhibited at high light intensities, especially in the presence of glucose. Oxygen evolution measurements indicated that, under conditions of high light, the rate of synthesis of functional PSII was less in the mutant than in the wild-type. Immunoblotting experiments conducted on cells blocked in protein synthesis further indicated that degradation of D1 was slowed in the mutant. Overall, our observations indicate that the HtrA family of proteases are involved in the resistance of Synechocystis 6803 to light stress and play a part, either directly or indirectly, in the repair of PSII in vivo.

J	Hu, JM; Zhang, JT; Zhang, JQ; Cao, CN								Corrosion electrochemical characteristics of red iron oxide pigmented epoxy coatings on aluminum alloys								CORROSION SCIENCE				47	11			2607	2618		10.1016/j.corsci.2004.11.009				NOV 2005	2005	Red iron oxide pigmented epoxy coatings were prepared on aluminum alloys and were characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) immersed in NaCl solution. The evolutions of impedance models of coated metals were obtained by the fitting analysis of experimental data using suitable equivalent electrical circuits (EEC). The results indicated that the composite electrode system could be fitted by three impedance models. At the initial immersion stage, coatings acted as a barrier layer and only performed a simple circuit consisting of a coating resistance (R-c) parallel to a coating capacitance (C-c). After a certain time of exposure, water and (or) oxygen arrived at the metal surface through the coating,. leading to the formation of electrochemical corrosion sites at metal interface and thereby the appearance of double-layer capacitance (C-dl) and charge transfer resistance (R-ct). After intensive attacking of metal substrates, the mass transfer of corrosion products was in difficulty. In this case, the diffusion elements were added to the EEC. It was found that due to the presence of inert pigment particles, the mass transfer behaviors were interestingly different from those of the varnish polymer coatings. Electrical parameters were also obtained from the EIS data. lnC(c)-time curve showed a Case 11 water sorption kinetics, typical non-Fickian diffusion for water uptake. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The variation in electrical characteristics of Al-CVD SiO2 Si metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitors (determined from high frequency capacitance-voltage C-V curves) with respect to wafer cleaning procedure, deposition method and subsequent thermal annealing at temperatures less than or equal to 500-degrees-C was investigated. The modification of the electrical properties of CVD SiO2 films with processing parameters was interpreted in terms of physicochemical changes involved in the different processes of MOS capacitor fabrication: (i) the variation in bulk CVD SiO2 properties (relative dielectric constant and resistivity) was interpreted in terms of the evolution of water content in the films vs. the preparation conditions; (ii) the behaviour of a parameter which characterizes the Si SiO2 interface (positive fixed charge) was interpreted in terms of changes which occur at this interface as a result of native oxide growth and as a result of ion implantation at low energy during argon plasma etching of silicon wafers, or by ion implantation of oxygen, carbon and hydrogen atoms during the initial stage of the PECVD process.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0040-6090			WOS:A1992JR30100010

Considering the paradigmatic CO oxidation reaction, a strong synergistic effect on CO catalytic oxidation was recently observed on a partly dewetted ZnO(0001)/Pt(111) single crystal surface. In order to bridge the material gap, we have examined whether this inverse metal/oxide catalytic effect could be transposed on supported ZnPt nanocatalysts deposited on rutile TiO2(110). Synchrotron radiation near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) operated at 1 mbar of O-2 : CO mixture (4 : 1) was used at a temperature range between room temperature and 450 K. To tackle the complexity of the problem, we have also studied the catalytic activity of nanoparticles (NPs) of the same size, consisting of pure Pt and Zn nanoparticles (NPs), for which, moreover, NAP-XPS studies are a novelty. The comparative approach shows that the CO oxidation process is markedly different for the pure Pt and pure Zn NPs. For pure Pt NPs, CO poisoned the metallic surfaces at low temperature at the onset of CO2 evolution. In contrast, the pure Zn NPs first oxidize into ZnO, and trap carbonates at low temperature. Then they start to release CO2 in the gas phase, at a critical temperature, while continuously producing it. The pure Zn NPs are also immune to support encapsulation. The bimetallic nanoparticle borrows some of its characteristics from its two parent metals. In fact, the ZnPt NP, although produced by the sequential deposition of platinum and zinc, is platinum-terminated below the temperature onset of CO oxidation and poisoned by CO. Above the CO oxidation onset, the nanoparticle becomes Zn-rich with a ZnO shell. Pure Pt and ZnPt NPs present a very similar activity towards CO oxidation, in contrast with what is reported in a single crystal study. The present study demonstrates the effectiveness of NAP-XPS in the study of complex catalytic processes at work on nanocatalysts under near-ambient pressures, and highlights once more the difficulty of transposing single crystal surface observations to the case of nanoobjects.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000429530400037	29577122	
J	Kraft, RP; Sneden, C; Smith, GH; Shetrone, MD; Fulbright, J					Shetrone, Matthew/0000-0003-0509-2656			Proton capture chains in globular cluster stars. III. Abundances of giants in the second-parameter globular cluster NGC 7006								ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL				115	4			1500	1515		10.1086/300279				APR 1998	1998	High-resolution spectra have been obtained of six red giants in the globular cluster NGC 7006 using the HIRES instrument on the Keck I Telescope. The [iron-peak/Fe] and [alpha-nuclei/Fe] elemental ratios are similar to those found in other halo globular clusters. Significant, but modest, star-to-star abundance differences are found for the elements O, Na, and Al, with the [O/Fe] abundance ratio being anticorrelated with both [Na/Fe] and [Al/Fe]. These anticorrelations indicate that O-->N processed material, within which Ne has also been converted to Na and Mg to Al by proton addition reactions, has been brought to the surface of the cluster giants via a deep-mixing mechanism that cycles material through the O-->N burning zone just outside the main hydrogen-burning shell. Despite the significant [Al/Fe] differences among the NGC 7006 giants, there is very little accompanying difference in [Mg/Fe]. This result, however, is not inconsistent with a deep-mixing origin for the [Al/Fe] enhancements; because Mg is initially much more abundant than Al, conversion of only a small fraction of Mg into Al can still produce a large percentage increase in the Al abundance,Plots of [Na/Fe] versus [O/Fe] and [Al/Fe] versus [Mg/Fe] indicate that the amount of proton-capture-processed material that has been mixed into the envelopes of the NGC 7006 giants is less extreme than within some giants of the globular clusters M13 and M15, In particular, unlike the NGC 7006 giants, most giants in M13 and some in M15 exhibit significantly reduced [O/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] ratios and very high [Al/Fe]. This difference in the [Mg/Fe] behavior may be related to differences in horizontal-branch morphology between M13 and NGC 7006, Within some M13 giants, it is possible that deep mixing has accessed regions in which not only has Mg been converted to Al but significant amounts of helium have also been produced from hydrogen burning. Deep mixing in such stars may not only significantly reduce the surface [Mg/Fe] ratio but may also increase the [He/H] ratio by amounts that will affect the zero-age horizontal-branch (HE) position that a giant will eventually occupy. This could explain the extension of the M13 HE to very blue colors. By contrast, giants in NGC 7006 experience modest amounts of interior mixing that may be deep enough to detectably alter the surface [Al/Fe] ratio, but not the [Mg/Fe] and [He/H] ratios. These stars will have a relatively low [He/H] ratio and so will adopt relatively red positions when they evolve onto the horizontal branch; the HE of NGC 7006 does indeed comprise a large percentage of stars redder than the RR Lyrae gap. In this scenario, deep mixing within cluster red giants may be one of the "second parameters" that affects horizontal-branch morphology.									79	0	0	0	0	0	79			0004-6256			WOS:000073023500026		
J	Xia, Xiao-Fei; Zheng, Jin-Jing; Shao, Guang-Ming; Wang, Jia-Lin; Liu, Xu-Sheng; Wang, Yu-Feng								Cloning and functional analysis of glutathione peroxidase gene in red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii								FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY				34	6			1587	1595		10.1016/j.fsi.2013.03.375				JUN 2013	2013	Glutathione peroxidases (GPxs) are key enzymes in the antioxidant defense systems of living organisms, including crustaceans. The red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii is the most commonly farmed freshwater crayfish in Chinese inland nowadays due to its commercial value. However, high stocking density has resulted in adverse effects in growth performance and health. To investigate the function of GPxs in immune defense of the crayfish, we cloned and characterized a full length GPx (PcGPx) from P. clarkii by a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The 931 bp PcGPx cDNA contains a 38 bp 5'-untranslated region (UTR), a 519 bp coding sequence (CDS) and a 375 bp 3'-UTR with a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS). The PcGPx was predicted to encode 172 amino acids, and its putative molecular mass was 20.9 kDa with a pI of 4.37. A selenocysteine (Sec) encoded by the unusual stop codon, TGA, was in the protein coding region. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PcGPx clustered with the GPxs from the penaeid shrimp Metapenaeus ensis and Caenorhabditis elegans, sharing much higher similarity with vertebrate GPx1 and GPx2 than with GPx3 and GPx5. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that PcGPx was extremely highly expressed in ovary and early embryos. In addition, the levels of PcGPx mRNA and reactive oxygen species (ROS) significantly increased after challenge with gram-negative Vibrio harveyi, gram-positive Staphyloccocus aureus or white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). These results suggest that PcGPx may play important roles not only in immune defense, but also in oogenesis in the crayfish. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a lamellar cobalt oxide (CoO), black phosphorus (BP) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) hybrid electrocatalyst is reported. BP domains are anchored on RGO and coated with CoO via P-O bonds. The widespread P-O bond network constitutes the proton acceptor and forms a proton exit channel, akin to the use of Asp61 in Photosystem II (PSII). The innermost kernel layer RGO serves as the current collector and forms an electron exit channel, mimicking the function of Tyr161 for charge transfer. The outermost encapsulation CoO layer acts as water oxidation catalyst (WOC). These biology-inspired features endow an outstanding OER performance of the hybrid material with a low overpotential of 206 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This work provides a new design guide for OER electrocatalysts through constructing two specialized channels for proton and electron transfer.

The deposit is a typical highly fractured and altered, disseminated gold system, with high-grade, quartz-sulphide vein/veinlet stockworks that cut Mesozoic granodiorite. There are four stages of veins that developed in the following sequence: (1) quartz-K-feldspar-sericite; (2) quartz-pyrite+/-arsenopyrite; (3) quartz-base metal sulfide; and (4) quartz-carbonate. Fluid inclusions in quartz and calcite in vein/veinlet stockworks contain C-O-H fluids of three main types. The first type consists of dilute CO2-H2O fluids coeval with the early vein stage. Molar volumes of these CO2-H2O fluid inclusions, ranging from 50-60 cm(3)/mol, yield estimated minimum trapping pressures of greater than or equal to3 kbar. Homogenization temperatures, obtained mainly from CO2-H2O inclusions with lower CO2 concentration, range from 267-375 degreesC. The second inclusion type, with a CO2-H2O+/-CH4 composition, was trapped during the main mineralizing stages. These fluids may reflect the CO2-H2O fluids that were modified by fluid/rock reactions with altered wallrocks. Isochores for CO2-H2O+/-CH4 inclusions, with homogenization temperatures ranging from 204-325 degreesC and molar volumes from 55 to 70 cm(3)/mol, provide an estimated minimum trapping pressure of 1.2 kbar. The third inclusion type, aqueous inclusions, trapped in cross-cutting microfractures in quartz and randomly in calcite, are post-mineralization, and have homogenization temperatures between 143-228 degreesC and salinities from 0.71-7.86 wt% NaCl equiv. Stable isotope data show that the metamorphic fluid contribution is minimal and that ore fluids are of magmatic origin, most likely sourced from 120-126 Ma mafic to intermediate dikes. This is consistent with the carbonic nature of the fluid, and the cross-cutting nature of those deposits relative to the host Mesozoic granitoid.									274	148	0	0	2	0	358			0026-4598	1432-1866		WOS:000185140600007

In this Review, we present engineering principles promoting the electro-/photochemical performance of MOF-based materials for ECS by component design and nanostructuring. Through the discussion of the engineering strategies of pristine MOFs, MOF composites, and their derivatives for ECS, the superiority and composition-structure-activity relationships of the engineered MOF-based materials with advanced components and nanostructures will be clarified. Finally, we provide a concluding discussion on the challenges and direction of future development in this emerging area of MOF-based materials for ECS.									157	3	0	0	4	0	157			2380-8195			WOS:000514258200020		
J	Aucour, AM; Sheppard, SMF; Guyomar, O; Wattelet, J								Use of C-13 to trace origin and cycling of inorganic carbon in the Rhone river system								CHEMICAL GEOLOGY				159	1-4			87	105		10.1016/S0009-2541(99)00035-2				JUL 8 1999	1999	Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) were sampled at 20 sites on the Rhone and its main tributaries from Switzerland to the Mediterranean, in March, September and July (flood event) 1996. Flux estimation and DIC and PIC delta(13)C values are used to trace watershed inputs and fluvial processes affecting the inorganic carbon budget. DIC concentration and delta(13)C values vary between similar to 1 mM at - 5 parts per thousand near the Rhone's source and similar to 3 mM at - 10 parts per thousand near its mouth, with tributaries draining lowland, carbonate-dominated areas at similar to 3.8 mM and similar to 11 parts per thousand. There is an inverse relationship between river DIC concentration and DIC delta(13)C. The headwaters are characterized by high DIC delta(13)C values and low DIC, indicating a minor input of respired CO2. DIC should be mainly produced through the reaction of carbonate with atmospheric CO2 or organic/sulfuric acids. In lowland, carbonate-dominated areas, delta(13)C values of similar to -11 parts per thousand are consistent with production of DIC by weathering of limestone C (delta(13)C approximate to - 1 parts per thousand) with CO2 derived from the oxidation of organic matter (delta(13)C approximate to -21.5 parts per thousand). The evolution of the Rhone's DIC concentration and delta(13)C appear to be largely determined by mixing between the Rhone and its main tributaries. The CO2 fluxes and DIC delta(13)C mass-balance, calculated for the different segments of the Rhone, point to a net, but very limited input of fluvial respired CO2 from the oxidation of organic C (< 5%). The PIC represents a small but quite variable fraction of the inorganic carbon (< 3%), except on Alpine catchments and during floods. In these cases, it can be up to 10% of the DIC concentration and export. The carbon and oxygen isotopic composition of PIC from the Rhone during a flood and from Alpine tributaries falls within the delta-range of limestones (delta(13)C greater than or equal to -2 parts per thousand; delta(18)O greater than or equal to -6 parts per thousand). Relatively light PIC isotopic composition indicate mixing of sedimentary rocks and carbonate precipitated in situ. Data for the Rhone system are typical of watersheds presenting high chemical weathering rates for HCO3, and Alpine/lowland conditions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This enzyme is a complex which contains the MoFe protein encoded by nifDK and the Fe protein encoded by nifH. In addition to nifHDK, nifHDK-like genes were found in some Archaea and Firmicutes, but their function is unclear.Results: We sequenced the genome of Paenibacillus sabinae T27. A total of 4,793 open reading frames were predicted from its 5.27 Mb genome. The genome of P. sabinae T27 contains fifteen nitrogen fixation (nif) genes, including three nifH, one nifD, one nifK, four nifB, two nifE, two nifN, one nifX and one nifV. Of the 15 nif genes, eight nif genes (nifB, nifH, nifD, nifK, nifE, nifN, nifX and nifV) and two non-nif genes (orf1 and hesA) form a complete nif gene cluster. In addition to the nif genes, there are nitrogenase-like genes, including two nifH-like genes and five pairs of nifDK-like genes. IS elements on the flanking regions of nif and nif-like genes imply that these genes might have been obtained by horizontal gene transfer. Phylogenies of the concatenated 8 nif gene (nifB, nifH, nifD, nifK, nifE, nifN, nifX and nifV) products suggest that P. sabinae T27 is closely related to Frankia. RT-PCR analysis showed that the complete nif gene cluster is organized as an operon. We demonstrated that the complete nif gene cluster under the control of sigma(70)-dependent promoter enabled Escherichia coli JM109 to fix nitrogen. Also, here for the first time we demonstrated that unlike nif genes, the transcriptions of nifHDK-like genes were not regulated by ammonium and oxygen, and nifH-like or nifD-like gene could not restore the nitrogenase activity of Klebsiella pneumonia nifH-and nifD-mutant strains, respectively, suggesting that nifHDK-like genes were not involved in nitrogen fixation.Conclusions: Our data and analysis reveal the contents and distribution of nif and nif-like genes and contribute to the study of evolutionary history of nitrogen fixation in Paenibacillus. For the first time we demonstrated that the transcriptions of nifHDK-like genes were not regulated by ammonium and oxygen and nifHDK-like genes were not involved in nitrogen fixation.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			1471-2164			WOS:000344884400001	25163544

Mixtures comprising the active mass of the anodic (as Pb source) and cathodic (as PbO2 source) spent electrodes and MnO2, and CuO powders were melted in corundum crucibles at 900 degrees C for 10 min. Manganese ions were used as dopant due to their significant role in hydrogen evolution reactions in sulfuric acid solution. The recycled and copper-manganese-doped samples were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). XRD and FTIR spectroscopy data show that by doping with the higher CuO content, the amount of sulfated crystalline phases was decreased. The IR spectra show the presence of sulfate ions and of [PbOn] and [CuOn] structural units in all the vitroceramic samples. EPR data indicate that the local structure around the Mn+2 and Cu+2 paramagnetic ions is dependent on the content of copper oxide, and the intensity of the resonance line corresponding to the Cu+2 ion was modified with the increase in the dopant content. XAS data analysis indicates that the lead atom has + 2 and + 4 oxidation states and that by increasing the dopant content there is a process of ordering of oxygen atoms around the lead atom similar to the PbO2 theoretical model. In the cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements, the recycled samples were used as working electrodes in a solution of sulfuric acid of the same concentration as that used in the car battery. The electrode material with x = 30 mol% CuO exhibited large oxidation and reduction waves and good reversibility of the cyclic voltammetry which improved the redox process in the lead-acid battery.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000843960900001

Heterogeneous nanocrystalline structures of Co-substituted Fe83.3-xCoxSi4B8P4Cu0.7 (x = 0, 4, 10 and 20 at.%) alloys consist of two phases: alpha-Fe(Co) phases and continuously distributed residual amorphous phases. The nanopores on as-dealloyed Fe-Co-Si-B-P-Cu alloys are smaller in size with higher Co concentrations. This is ascribed to the finer alpha-Fe(Co) phases distributed in the precursor alloys after nanocrystallization. Nanoporous architectures after dealloying inherit the microstructural characteristics of Fe-Co-Si-B-P-Cu precursor alloys. The short-term and long-term CV curves of nanoporous Redox electrodes in 0.5 M KOH solution demonstrate that Redox reactions have been enhanced by partial substitution of Fe by Co and the best Redox performance can be obtained on as-dealloyed Fe79.3Co4Si4B8P4Cu0.7 alloys because of the highest Redox peak current density of 90 mA cm(-2) after 150 CV cycles. However, the stabilities of nanoporous Fe79.3Co4Si4B8P4Cu0.7 electrodes have a predictable decline due to the overgrowth of Fe3O4 octahedra and destruction of the ligaments during long-term Redox cycling. On the other hand, the better Redox stabilities has achieved on as-dealloyed Fe63.3Co20Si4B8P4Cu0.7 alloys with stable oxidation peak current densities of 45-47 mA cm(-2) from 950 to 3000 CV cycles, about 2.3 times the nanoporous Co-free Fe83.3Si4B8P4Cu0.7 electrodes. The stabilities are considered to result from the relatively small Fe3O4 octahedra, the stabilization of the amorphous Co3O4 outmost layers and the transformation of amorphous and crystalline Co3O4 phases during long-term Redox cycling. The Co substitution of Fe83.3Si4B8P4Cu0.7 precursor alloys can achieve the high Redox performances and good stabilities of nanoporous electrodes.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			1044-5803	1873-4189		WOS:000584354900001

Ni(OH)2 has a hexagonal layered structure with two polymorphs, alpha- and beta-Ni(OH)(2). alpha-Ni(OH)(2) shows superior electrochemical properties compared to those of the beta-form. Nanosized flowerlike alpha-nickel hydroxide materials with an interlayer spacing of 7.0 angstrom have been prepared by a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method. The experimental results from XRD and FF-IR showed that the Ni(OH)(2) sample prepared by this method had the typical alpha-phase. FE-SEM images showed many uniform flowerlike architectures with diameters of 700 nm-1 mu m which consisted of the aggregated flakes. TEM results showed the flakes were built up from many nanocrystals with 2-3 nm diameters. TGA and TPD were employed to investigate thermal stability and gas evolution during the heating process. alpha-Nickel hydroxide was transferred to NiO with a cubic crystalline structure after being calcined at 450 degrees C; the NiO still kept the morphology of alpha-Ni(OH)(2). Cyclic voltammetry was used to determine the electrochemical properties of the Ni(OH)(2) electrode in 1 M KOH. alpha-Ni(OH)(2) prepared by MW-HT had the best electrochemical activity for the electrochemical reduction of O-2 compared with alpha-Ni(OH)(2) synthesized by conventional HT methods and beta-Ni(OH)(2). The effects of nickel sources and precipitators on the phase and morphology of the products were studied. Conventional hydrothermal methods were used to study the role of microwave irradiation. The possible growth mechanism is discussed here. The CV experiments showed that H2O2 can be reduced to OH- on the alpha-Ni(OH)(2) electrode. The Levich equation was used to calculate the number of electrons transferred during the O-2 redox reaction.									375	23	0	0	19	0	383			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000252047600046

The use of solar energy to split water and produce clean, renewable hydrogen as an energy source is a feasible and effective approach to solve these problems. As the most promising semiconductor material for photocatalytic water splitting, TiO2-based nanomaterials have received increasing attention from researchers in academia and industry in recent years. This review describes the research progress in the theoretical calculations of TiO2-based photocatalysts in water splitting. First, it briefly introduces some commonly used theoretical calculation methods, the crystal structure of TiO2 and its photocatalytic mechanism, and the principle of doping and heterojunction modification to improve the photocatalytic performance of TiO2. Subsequently, the adsorption state of water molecules with different coverages on the surface of TiO2, the rate-limiting steps of the splitting of water molecules on the surface of TiO2, and the transfer process of photogenerated current carriers at the interface between water molecules and TiO2 are analyzed. In addition, a brief review of research into the theoretical calculations of TiO2-based commercial photocatalysts in the field of water splitting is also provided. Finally, the calculation of TiO2-based photocatalytic water-splitting simulations is summarized, and possible future research and development directions are discussed.									30	0	0	0	1	0	29			2191-9089	2191-9097		WOS:000589633600001

In this work, the degradation kinetics of Czochralski-grown monocrystalline silicon (Cz-Si) induced by light at an elevated temperature were studied in detail. The lifetime evolutions over time during (1) light soaking (LS), (2) dark annealing-light soaking (DA-LS), and (3) DA-LS cycling experiments were analyzed. Ratios of the capture coefficients for the electrons and holes (k-values) were used to characterize the possible defects responsible for degradation. We found that the behavior of degradation and recovery under light soaking with or without a dark annealing treatment was mostly like boron-oxygen (BO)-related degradation but gave k-values from 19 to 25. In the DA-LS cycling experiment, the max degradation amplitudes hardly changed from the second cycle, and the k-values decreased with an increase in the cycling number. We then analyzed the possible reactions in Cz-Si and discuss the relationship between BO defects and LeTID.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1996-1073		WOS:000594164000001

Herein, a systematic study of the application of single-phase pseudobrookite Fe2TiO5 nanoparticles as oxygen-evolving photocatalyst for water splitting, in a suspended particle system, is presented. A solvothermal route was employed for the synthesis of Fe2TiO5 nanoparticles with average diameter of (34 +/- 8) nm. The obtained orange powder absorbs a broad portion of the solar spectrum (band gap of 2.1 eV) and produces 7.0 mu mol of O-2 within 5 h, under visible light irradiation. In order to enhance the catalytic activity of Fe2TiO5, NiO and Co3O4 cocatalyst nanoparticles were, separately, attached to the surface through the conventional impregnation and the magnetron sputtering deposition (MSD) methods. The homogeneous coverage with cocatalysts nanoparticles provided by the latter, allied to the reduced dimensions of the formed oxide nanoparticles (similar to 1 nm), resulted in an enhanced photoactivity of Fe2TiO5. The Co3O4-modified materials prepared through magnetron sputtering and impregnation depositions produced 58.8 and 26.2 mu mol of O-2 within 5 h under visible light, respectively. Similar behavior was observed for the NiO-modified nanomaterial, which generated 25.5 and 12.6 mu mol of O-2, respectively. These results reflect the potentiality of Fe2TiO5 nanoparticles to be employed as a particulate water splitting photocatalyst, especially when containing homogeneously distributed nanoparticles of the Co3O4 cocatalyst on the surface. Photoelectrochemical measurements further confirmed these conclusions, as Co3O4 and NiO fine deposits substantially reduce the water oxidation overpotential of a Fe2TiO5 photoanode and enhance the intensity of the anodic photocurrent due to the improved oxidation kinetics, the reduced charge recombination rates, and the lowered charge transfer resistance at the solid/liquid interface.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			2574-0970			WOS:000575846000079

Thermal, thermo-oxidative and photo-oxidative studies were conducted. Thermo-oxidation below 180 degrees C shows more similarities between EVA and LDPE. The luminescence spectra of degraded EVA and LDPE were almost identical but very different to that of PVAc. UV-vis analysis showed that the polyenes present in aged PVC were unlikely to be the same species responsible for the observed colour formation in aged EVA. It is suggested that they are polyconjugated carbonyl products. Rheological analysis also showed the evolution of crosslinking reactions during thermo-oxidation. FTIR studies after thermal degradation in inert conditions 290 degrees C showed complete loss of the ester functionality and associated lactone formation along with some evidence for ketonic and unsaturated carbonyl groups. Degradation in air at 180 degrees C, however, revealed that loss of the ester group was not so marked, with PVAc exhibiting the greatest stability. This was in line with the induction time to onset of autocatalytic carbonyl growth at 180 degrees C; the latter showed an apparent exponential decrease with increasing vinyl acetate content up to 28% w/w. Fluorescence analysis produced trends that complemented those of carbonyl index; the time to decomposition of initial fluorescent alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl species coincided with the time to onset of carbonyl growth. Furthermore, the rate of formation of the new fluorescent species produced in EVA, and LDPE was similar to that of carbonyl growth. These new fluorescent species are therefore likely to be di- or tri-carbonyl products. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the highly inert character of CH4, the selective cleavage of its first C-H bond without over-oxidation is essential for transforming CH4 into value-added products. In this work, we developed an efficient and selective CH4 conversion approach at room temperature using intermediate chlorine species (*Cl), which were electrochemically generated and stabilized on mixed cobalt-nickel spinels with different Co/Ni ratios. The lower overpotentials for *Cl formation enabled an effective activation and conversion of CH4 to CH3Cl without over-oxidation to CO2, and Ni3+ at the octahedral sites in the mixed cobalt-nickel spinels allowed to stabilize surface-bound *Cl species. The CoNi2Ox electrocatalyst exhibited an outstanding yield of CH3Cl (364 mmol g(-1) h(-1)) and a high CH3Cl/CO2 selectivity of over 400 at room temperature, with demonstrated capability of direct CH4 conversion under seawater working conditions.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000668282500001	34060206

In this work, the electronic properties such as the band structure, density of states and band edge placement of 10 (M2MIII/IV)-M-II-NO3-LDHs = Mg2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+; M-III = Al3+, In3+, Cr3+, Fe3+; M-IV = Ti4+), thermodynamic mechanism, and thermodynamically favorable products of CO2PR, especially CO and CH4, over these LDHs are investigated by using Hubbard-corrected density functional theory. The calculation results indicate that all LDHs except the Mg2Al- and Mg2In-LDHs are responsive to visible light, and all the LDHs have enough driving force to undergo CO2PR to products except the Ni2Al-and Ni2Fe-LDHs. For Mg- and Zn-containing LDHs, the COOH pathway is favorable, while the Ni2Ti- and Co2Al-LDHs prefer the HCOO pathway. According to the minimumfree-energy reaction pathway, for Co2Fe-LDH, CO2PR prefers to generate HCOOH, and the potential-determining step is HCOO* -> HCOOH*. For the Mg2Al-, Mg2In-, Co2Al-, Ni2Ti-, Zn2Al-, Zn2Cr-, and Zn2Ti-NO3-LDHs, CH4 is the favorable final product via HCOOH, HCHO, or CH3OH intermediates. The formation of CO mainly goes through the COOH pathway. The relationship between the effective driving force of CO2PR to CH4 or CO and the adsorption energy of the reactant CO2 or the valence band maximum (VBM) of LDHs reveals that the Mg2In-LDH and Mg2Al-LDH, which have a moderate adsorption and VBM favor CO2PR to CH4 and CO the most, respectively. On the Co2Fe-LDH (110), CO2 prefers to form CH4 than that of the Co2Fe-LDH (003), which indicates that the crystal faces also affect favorable products of CO2PR. This work provides useful information of the photocatalytic performance of LDH materials for CO2PR and is helpful for the design of highly efficient CO2PR catalysts.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000752572800001

In the Tandilia System (Argentina), Rio de la Plata Craton, this event was recorded in the basement marble of the San Miguel area. The calcite-diopside marble, hosted by biotite gneiss and intruded by 2.12 Ga garnet-leucogranite, was metamorphosed in amphibolite facies during the Transamazonian Cycle.PAAS-normalised rare-earth elements (REE) and Y for the carbonate rocks are HREE-enriched and display positive Eu and Y anomalies, typical of primary precipitates from a mixed hydrothermal-marine environment carbonate. Additionally, a truly negative Ce anomaly for all the samples indicates that the depositional environment was oxidising.Positive delta C-13 values ranging from +5.90 to +4.30 parts per thousand (V-PDB), and delta O-18 from +17.45 to +13.84 parts per thousand (V-SMOW) were determined in this marble, both gradually decreasing towards the contact with the leucogranites. These values indicate that devolatilization reactions took place during the crystallisation of a wollastonite-vesuvianite-grossular-diopside skarn generated by the leucogranite intrusions into the marble. delta O-18 values obtained from diopside and calcite crystals, in the marble sectors furthest from the contacts with leucogranite, allowed a 663-623 degrees C formation temperature to be calculated, considering oxygen in a calcite-diopside geothermometric pair. These temperatures are consistent with the metamorphic degree (amphibolite facies) reached in this portion of the basement.Although the San Miguel marble shows petrographic and mineralogical evidence of regional and contact metamorphism, important geochemical and isotopic characteristics, together with its estimated Palaeoproterozoic age, indicate that the marble protolith was a marine carbonate deposited during the "Lomagundi-Jatuli event".									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0301-9268	1872-7433		WOS:000469157300025

The effects of different Ni/Co ratios, decomposition temperature and decomposition time on the phase constituent of nickel-cobalt oxides were addressed in detail. The crystallinity, purity, and surface morphology of the as-prepared NiCo2O4 fibers were investigated by XRD, IR, SEM, respectively. Finally, structure of nickel cobaltite spinel examined by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XPS) indicates, as expected, that Ni occupies the octahedral sites of the spinel structure while Co occupies both tetrahedral and octahedral sites. The result of the surface examination by xps shows that the surface composition is different from nominal bulk composition.					138th TMS Annual Meeting and Exhibition138th TMS Annual Meeting and Exhibition	FEB 15-19, 2009FEB 15-19, 2009		San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-87339-740-7	WOS:000264675200095

Aluminum nitride (AlN) thin films were grown on Si(100) substrates via hollow-cathode plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition (HCPA-ALD) using trimethylaluminum (TMA) and Ar/N-2/H-2 plasma as metal precursor and coreactant, respectively. Growth saturation experiments within 100-250 degrees C temperature range were carried out without interruption as extended single runs featuring 10-cycle subruns for each parameter change. The sensitivity of the multiwavelength ellipsometry provided sufficient resolution to observe not only the minuscule changes in the growth-per-cycle (GPC) parameter, but also the single chemical adsorption (chemisorption) and plasma-assisted ligand removal events. GPC values showed a slight increasing slope within 100-200 degrees C, followed by a stronger surge at 250 degrees C, signaling the onset of thermal decomposition. The real-time dynamic in situ monitoring revealed mainly the following insights into the HCPA-ALD process of AlN: (i) film growth rate and TMA chemisorption amount exhibited plasma power dependent saturation behavior, which was also correlated with the substrate temperature; (ii) time-dependent refractive index evolution indicated a nonconstant relationship: a faster increase within the first similar to 100 cycles followed by a slower increase as the AlN film gets thicker; and (iii) a considerable improvement in crystallinity was observed when the substrate temperature exceeded 200 degrees C. Besides in situ optical characterization, ex situ optical, structural, and chemical characterization studies were also carried out on 500-cycle grown AlN films as a function of substrate temperature. All AlN samples displayed a single-phase wurtzite polycrystalline character with no detectable carbon and relatively low (<5%) oxygen content within the bulk of the films. Moreover, regardless of the deposition temperature, HCPA-ALD grown AlN films exhibited highly stoichiometric elemental composition.

The site was located at similar to 60 degrees S paleolatitude in Cretaceous times. A total of 59 samples studied from Holes 1513A and 1513B yielded 140 calcareous and nine agglutinated benthic foraminiferal taxa. Gavelinellids (Notoplanulina, Gavelinella, Anomalinoides) and Gyroidinoides spp., are the most abundant taxa overall and also dominate most samples. We also report 382 foraminiferal stable isotopic measurements and infer cooling [of similar to 5 degrees C in surface waters and 2 degrees C at the seafloor] based on changes in delta O-18 values for benthic and planktonic taxa through the Santonian at Site U1513. Inferred cooling was accompanied by changes in planktonic and benthic foraminiferal assemblages. At Site U1513, benthic foraminiferal taxonomic richness declines by 15 species (from 20- 25 to 5-10 taxa) towards the upper Santonian. Within this interval, epifaunal, oxic foraminifera diminish in absolute and relative abundance, and there is a parallel relative increase in opportunistic taxa and infaunal foraminifera. Changes in benthic foraminiferal communities indicate a shift from oligotrophic to eutrophic conditions in the bottom water despite the general cooling trend. This paper explores the causes and effects of the paleoenvironmental changes in the bottom waters.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0377-8398	1872-6186		WOS:000854036000003

Rietveld and POWD studies proved that the composition crystallizes in tetragonal structure as the primary phase. Ti-O perovskite vibrations were studied by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. The TiO6 octahedral stretching, O-Ti-O vibrations and Nb-O-Fe stretching vibrations of PFN were studied by Raman spectroscopy. The broadening of Raman modes was analysed in the framework of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle using phonon confinement model. Field emission gun-scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) studies revealed the dense grain distributions, grain growth and purity. UV-visible analysis was done to study the narrow band gap and Urbach energy. The effect of structural distortions and electronegativity on band gap were analysed. The photocatalytic response was studied by estimating the band edge levels using Mulliken's model. The evaluated conduction band minimum level is sufficiently negative with respect to the H+/H-2 (0 eV) level, which strongly signifies the possible occurrence of the photocatalytic hydrogen emission reaction. A detailed electrical analysis was done to study the dielectric properties, relaxation, negative temperature coefficient of resistance (NTCR)-type response and DC conductivity. AC conductivity studies revealed the presence of overlapping large polaron tunnelling (OLPT) model. The effect of oxygen vacancies on relaxation and its correlation with activation energy were discussed. Multiferroic nature was confirmed from room temperature studies of P-E and M-H hysteresis loops. Fe3+ <-> Fe3+ (F centre) exchange and Fe3+ <-> Fe2+ double exchange mechanisms were discussed. A magnetic improvement was noticed on reduction of temperature to 50 K. The simultaneous existence of weak ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism is one of the interesting outcomes of the present study, which may provide a new multiferroic material for advanced electro-optical applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1229-7801	2234-0491		WOS:000826822900002

Herein, a facile strategy has been proposed to in-situ grow nitrogen-doped carbon dots (NCDs) decorated Ni3S2 on Ni foam (NCDs/Ni3S2/NF) by hydrothermal treatment of Ni foam in water solution of thiourea and NCDs. Interestingly, coral-like NCDs/Ni3S2/NF composites are unprecedentedly prepared without any templates, where the Ni3S2 nanorods mainly expose {021} high-index facets. The resultant NCDs/Ni3S2/NF composites are directly used as self-supported electrodes for overall water splitting which deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.50 V with excellent durability in 1.0 M KOH solution.

However, detailed decomposition of the nanostructured Li2O2 product, held at least partially responsible for the limited reversibility and poor rate performance, is hard to measure operando under realistic electrochemical conditions. Here, we report operando nanobeam X-ray diffraction experiments that enable monitoring of the decomposition of individual Li2O2 grains in a working Li-O-2 battery. Platelet-shaped crystallites with aspect ratios between 2.2 and 5.5 decompose preferentially via the more reactive (001) facets. The slow and concurrent decomposition of individual Li2O2 crystallites indicates that the Li2O2 decomposition rate limits the charge time of these Li-O-2 batteries, highlighting the importance of using redox mediators in solution to charge Li-O-2 batteries.									11	0	0	0	3	0	11			1948-7185			WOS:000382603300016	27516071

Will, Patrizia/0000-0002-4134-7997			Pyrophyllite formation in the thermal aureole of a hydrothermal system in the Lower Saxony Basin, Germany								GEOFLUIDS				16	2			349	363		10.1111/gfl.12154				MAY 2016	2016	A combined clay mineralogical, fluid inclusion, and K-Ar study of Upper Jurassic metasediments at the Gehn (Lower Saxony Basin, Germany) provides evidence for a transient hydrothermal event during Upper Cretaceous basin inversion centered on a prominent gravimetric anomaly. Kaolinite and smectite in Oxfordian pelitic parent rocks that cap a deltaic sandstone unit were locally transformed into pyrophyllite, 2M(1) illite, R3 illite-smectite, chlorite, and berthierine at the Ueffeln quarry. The pyrophyllite-bearing metapelites lack bedding-parallel preferred orientation of sheet silicates and experienced peak temperatures of about 260-270 degrees C consistent with microthermometric data on quartz veins in the underlying silicified sandstones. The presence of expandable layers in illite-smectite and high Kubler Index values indicate that the thermal event was rather short-lived. K-Ar dating of the <0.2m fraction of the pyrophyllite-bearing Ueffeln metapelite yields a maximum illitization age of 117 +/- 2Ma. Lower trapping temperatures of aqueous fluid inclusions in quartz veins and the absence of pyrophyllite in metapelites of the Frettberg quarry in a distance of about 2.5km from the Ueffeln quarry infer maximum paleotemperatures of only 220 degrees C. The highly localized thermal anomaly at Ueffeln suggests fault-controlled fluid migration and heat transfer that provided a thermal aureole for pyrophyllite formation in the metapelites rather than metamorphism due to deep burial. A pH neutral hydrothermal fluid that formed by devolatilization reactions or less likely by mixing of meteoric and marine waters that interacted at depth with shales is indicated by the low salinity (3-5 wt.%NaCl equiv.) of aqueous inclusions, their coexistence with methane-carbon dioxide-dominated gas inclusions as well as carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen isotope data. The upwelling zone of hydrothermal fluids and the thermal maximum is centered on a gravimetric anomaly interpreted as an igneous intrusion (Bramsche Massif') providing the heat source for the intrabasinal hydrothermal system.									8	1	0	0	0	0	9			1468-8115	1468-8123		WOS:000376266000010

The IrO2-TiO2 interlayer was obtained from a mixture of TiN nano-particle and H2IrCl6 solution. The influence of the interlayer composition and calcination temperature on the electrocatalytic activity and service life of electrode was investigated by electrochemical measurements, scanning electron microscopy. X-ray diffraction, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Compared with the traditiona Ti/IrO2 electrode, the surface morphology and composition of the Ti/IrO2-TiO2/IrO2 electrode did not change with adding the interlayer, and also the character of the electrocatalytic response had not changed, but its service life as improved greatly. The optimal condition for preparation of Ti/IrO2-TiO2/IrO2 electrode was that the calcination temperature was 450 degrees C and n(Ir)/n(Ti) of the interlayer was 1.5.									3	7	0	0	0	0	8			0253-9837	1872-2067		WOS:000262385100013

Scanning electron microscopy images on the resulting powders exhibited particles with irregular shape at 300-500 nm in size. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed formation of a perovskite with complete disappearance of rutile signals from IrO2, indicating successful incorporation of Ir4+ at the Co3+ sites. Supported on carbon nanocapsules, the La0.6Ca0.4CoIr0.25O3.5-delta demonstrated superior performance over those of La0.6Ca0.4CoO3 in both charging and discharging current density-voltage polarizations. In addition, galvanostatic charging and discharging measurements at 25 and 100 mA/cm(2) indicated that the electrocatalytic abilities of La0.6Ca0.4CoIr0.25O3.5-delta are stable and sustainable.									14	2	0	0	1	0	15			1099-0062	1944-8775		WOS:000253238000005

J	Saio, H; Nomoto, K				Nomoto, Ken'ichi/A-4393-2011				Inward propagation of nuclear-burning shells in merging C-O and He white dwarfs								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				500	1			388	397		10.1086/305696				JUN 10 1998	1998	We have investigated the consequences of merging double white dwarf systems by calculating evolutionary models of accreting white dwarfs. We have considered two cases: a massive C-O white dwarf of similar to 1 M-. accreting C-O mixture and a low-mass white dwarf with an initial mass of 0.4 M-. accreting matter composed mostly of helium. The accretion rate of the C-O white dwarf is assumed to be 1 x 10(-5) Mo-. yr(-1). After carbon burning is ignited at M-r similar to 1.04 M-., the flame propagates inward because of heat conduction. By inserting enough grid points to resolve the structure of the flame, we have obtained almost steady burning in most phases of evolution, but we have found a new phenomenon that the strength of flame sometimes oscillates because of a thermal instability in an early phase of the evolution. In calculating evolutionary models, we have occasionally employed a steady-burning approximation, in which the propagation speed of flame is given a priori. We have considered two extreme cases for the interior abundance of the massive white dwarf: X-c = 0.5 and X-c = 0.2. For X-c = 0.5, the flame becomes very weak at M-r similar to 0.4 M-. and the inward propagation stalls there. But a few thousand years later, the flame is reactivated because of contraction and propagates to the center. For X-x = 0.2, the flame propagates smoothly and reaches the center in similar to 1000 yr. In both cases the C-O mixture has been burned into an O-Ne-Mg mixture without causing an explosive phenomenon. For helium-accreting low-mass white dwarfs, we have considered accretion rates of 1 x 10(-7) and 1 x 10(-6) M-. yr(-1). After a fraction of M-. is accreted to the white dwarf, helium is ignited in the outer part and a shell flash occurs. Such a shell flash diminishes when about 10% of helium in the convective shell is burned into carbon and oxygen. The next shell hash occurs at a shell interior to the previously flashed shell. After less than 30 shell flashes, the helium ignition occurs at the center and steady burning begins. Thus, the merging produces a helium star that burns helium at the center. The mechanism of the propagation of the burning shell in this case is compressional heating during interpulse phases, in contrast to the case of the carbon-burning flame where the conduction drives the inward propagation of the flame.

CoFePB is able to quantitatively catalyze (100% Faradaic efficiency within less than 8% standard error at pH 5) the electrochemical oxidation of formate to CO, over a pH range of 1-13. This quantitative formate elecrooxidation is possible due to the exclusive selectivity of the catalyst in a wide potential window (from ca. 1.2 to 1.7 V vs RHE), where no other substrate in aqueous conditions is activated: neither other organic molecules, such as alcohols or acids, nor water itself. CoFePB is one of the first heterogeneous noble-metal-free catalysts reported for the electrooxidation of small hydrocarbon molecules. Importantly, the catalyst showed a very high tolerance against surface poisoning during the reaction, as supported by the cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data, thereby allowing CoFePB to operate at greater current density than state-of-the-art noble metal catalysts. For example, we observed that CoFePB is able to achieve a formate oxidation current similar to 10 mA cm(-2) at pH 5, 0.4 M formate at 1.4 V vs RHE, whereas a Pt disk and Pd(5%)/C electrodes had currents of 0.4 and 1.4 mA cm(-1), respectively, under identical conditions. The remarkable selectivity, stability, and high current density of CoFePB, in contrast to state-of-the-art catalysts based on platinum-group metals, is an important step in the search for inexpensive earth-abundant materials for oxidation of organic molecules for use in liquid fuel cells or for selective organic molecule sensors. Furthermore, because CoFePB is not poisoned by intermediates and can achieve higher current density than Pt or Pd, improvement of the catalyst onset potential can lead to higher power density formate oxidation fuel cells using earth-abundant metals than with Pt or Pd.									10	0	0	0	3	0	10			2574-0962			WOS:000576676900115

Semiconductors with suitable properties to promote solar-driven water splitting are a desideratum. A hitherto rarely investigated group of semiconductors are ferrites with the empirical formula MFe2O4 and related compounds. This contribution summarizes the published results of the experimental investigations on the photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic properties of these compounds. It will be shown that the potential of this group of compounds in regard to the production of solar hydrogen has not been fully explored yet. (C) 2015 Author(s).

In this work, we report on the microfabrication of patterned alpha-Ni(OH)(2) films on glass substrates which can be used for rechargeable microbatteries as well as for microcapacitors. A multilayer deposition technique is developed based on e-beam evaporation, ultraviolet lithography, and electroplating/electro-deposition which creates thin-film electrodes that are patterned with arrays of micropillars. The morphology and the structure of the patterned electrode films are characterized by employing field emission scanning electron microscopy. The chemical (elemental) composition is investigated by using X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Finally, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements are used to evaluate the electrochemical performance of the patterned thin film electrodes compared to patternless electrodes. We observe that patterning of the electrodes results in significantly improved stability and, thus, longer endurance while good electrochemical performance is maintained.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000356753500056	26000783

One of the most intriguing features concerning some of these lava flows is the occurrence of primary, magmatic calcite in the groundmass. The primary, magmatic nature of calcite has been inferred by microtextural investigations showing that it typically occurs i) interstitially, associated with clinopyroxene, nepheline and phlogopite, ii) in spherical ocelli, associated with nepheline, fluorite and tangentially arranged clinopyroxene, and iii) in corona-like reaction zones around K-feldspar xenocrysts. These microtextural features distinctly indicate that calcite crystallized from a carbonate melt in a partially molten groundmass, implying that the temperature of the system was above the solidus of the hosted lava flow (>850 degrees C). Geochemical features of calcite crystals (i.e., stable isotope values and trace element patterns) corroborate their primary nature and give insights into the origin of the parental carbonate melt. The trace element patterns testify to a high-temperature crystallization process (not hydrothermal) involving a carbonate melt coexisting with a silicate melt. The high delta C-18 (around 27 parts per thousand SMOW) and wide delta C-13 (-18 to + 5 parts per thousand PDB) values measured in the calcites preclude a mantle origin, but are consistent with an origin in the crust. In this framework, the crystallization of calcite can be linked to the interaction between magmas and carbonate-bearing wall rocks and, in particular, to the entrapment of solid and/or molten carbonate in the silicate magma. The stability of carbonate melt at low pressure and the consequent crystallization of calcite in the lava flow groundmass are ensured by the documented, high activity of fluorine in the studied system and by the limited ability of silicate and carbonate melts to mix at syn-eruptive time scales.

Such measurements reveal that PS II exists in at least two substates with distinct kinetic and thermodynamic behaviors. Since it is not affected by treatments to alter the formal redox state of the PS II centers it was concluded that the heterogeneity is probably due to the existence of at least two conformational substates of the PS II proteins. The observed heterogeneity persists on a time scale or minutes at physiological temperatures, and thus is likely to be important for PS II function in vivo. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Recently, numerous research studies have been devoted to the development of highly active, selective and stable catalysts for such fields of application. However, there is usually a trade-off between conversion of H2S and selectivity of S due to the inevitable overoxidation of H2S or S into SO2 on such highly active catalysts. In this contribution, we achieve high selectivity of sulfur for the selective oxidation of H2S without losing conversion by phosphate-modified N-doped three-dimensional (3D) mesoporous carbon/carbon nanotube (N-C/CNT) monolith carbocatalysts. The as-synthesized P-modified N-C/CNT monolith (N-C/CNT-6%P) presents a high sulfur selectivity of 91.3% with an excellent normalized sulfur formation rate (lambda(cat)) of 503 g(sulfur).kg(cat)(-1).h(-1), which is comparable with the most active carbon-based and metaloxide catalysts ever reported. Notably, the P-modified N-C/CNT monolith exhibits extremely high stability even under severe reaction environments with a high partial pressure of oxygen, H2O (50 vol %), and impurity gas (i.e., 50 vol % CO2), indicating the promising potential for the practical application. An in-depth investigation including structure evolution, performance variation and promotion mechanism is conducted from the perspective of interaction between the carbon matrix and -POx. The results indicate that the surface properties of P-modified N-C/CNT are regulated by the interaction between the phenol, pyrrolic, pyridinic N groups and P species after the phosphate modification. The improved selectivity with nearly unchanged conversion could be attributed to the moderate adsorption and activation of O-2 enabled by pyridinic nitrogen sites and the P species interaction, which is evidenced by advanced characterization, kinetic analysis and density functional theory (DFT) simulation.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000674927200021		
J	Forsman, Jack A.; Winter, Regan T.; Eaton-Rye, Julian J.								An improved system for the targeted mutagenesis of the psbA2 gene in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803: mutation of D1-Glu244 to His impairs electron transfer between Q(A) and Q(B) of Photosystem II								NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF BOTANY				57	2	SI		125	136		10.1080/0028825X.2019.1617321		APR 2019		APR 3 2019	2019	The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has three copies of the psbA gene encoding the D1 reaction centre protein of Photosystem II (PS II). We have designed a mutagenesis system that allows introduction of mutations into the constitutively expressed psbA2 copy without affecting the expression of any flanking genes. A triple deletion strain was constructed in which psbA1 and psbA3 were removed by markerless deletions and psbA2 was replaced by a chloramphenicol-resistance cassette. A vector was then designed to enable the reintroduction of psbA2 in the chromosome using a kanamycin-resistance cassette as a selectable marker. This system was used to generate a control strain, which had an unmodified copy of psbA2, and two mutant strains which contained a copy of psbA2 where the codon for D1-Glu244 had been mutated to code for a His or Asp. The D1-Glu244 residue was targeted as it has been hypothesised to participate in a hydrogen-bond network that is required for protonation of the PS II secondary plastoquinone electron acceptor Q(B). While the phenotype of the control strain was similar to wild type, the E244H mutant exhibited impaired oxygen evolution and altered electron transfer between the primary quinone acceptor Q(A) and Q(B). However, substitution of Glu-244 by Asp resulted in a mutant more closely resembling the control strain.									10	0	0	0	9	0	10			0028-825X	1175-8643		WOS:000468702000001		
J	Okumura, Azusa; Hosono, Takahiro; Boateng, Dennis; Shimada, Jun								Evaluations of the downward velocity of soil water movement in the unsaturated zone in a groundwater recharge area using delta O-18 tracer: the Kumamoto region, southern Japan								GEOLOGIA CROATICA				71	2			65	82		10.4154/gc.2018.09				2018	2018	Water and substances from the surface infiltrate the unsaturated zone before reaching ground-water. Yet, little study has been done on the unsaturated zone due to the difficulty of sampling. A lot of studies have been carried out on the top soil down to a depth of one metre and on shallow aquifers because they are easily accessible for sampling. The unsaturated zone of the Kumamoto region recharge areas is important due to concerns about groundwater pollution from agriculture. The aim of this study was to estimate the downward velocity of soil water movement through the unsaturated zone and the recharge rate using delta 18O as a tracer. Five sampling sites were selected and a core was taken from each site. The cores were cut into 0.1 m pieces and soil water was extracted from each to analyze for delta D and the delta 18O content. Average delta D and delta 18O compositions of soil water were similar to the isotopic compositions of summer precipitation. Annual average recharge rate and the downward velocity of soil water in each site were estimated by fitting a vertical delta 18O profile pattern to a precipitation delta 18O time series as a theoretical water displacement flow model for recharge. An estimated annual average recharge rate in the recharge area ranged from 745 to 1058 mm/yr with the annual average downward velocity of 1.37 to 2.34 m/yr. Based on the estimated downward velocity, the infiltration time for soil water to reach the aquifer was determined as ranging from 9 to 24 years, which corresponds with previous groundwater age estimations presented in an earlier published study on the same area. It was assumed that contaminants will reach aquifers in 9 to 25 years if the effects of diffusion and microbiological reaction are not taken into account.					44th Annual Congress of the International-Association-of-Hydrogeologists (IAH) on Groundwater Heritage and Sustainability44th Annual Congress of the International-Association-of-Hydrogeologists (IAH) on Groundwater Heritage and Sustainability	SEP 25-29, 2017SEP 25-29, 2017	Int Assoc HydrogeologistsInt Assoc Hydrogeologists	Int Assoc Hydrogeologists, Croatian Natl Chapter, Dubrovnik, CROATIAInt Assoc Hydrogeologists, Croatian Natl Chapter, Dubrovnik, CROATIA	17	0	0	0	8	0	17			1330-030X	1333-4875		WOS:000436082100004

Films were grown on LaAIO3 (001), SrTiO3 (001) and sapphire (R-plane) substrates. Pb(thd)2 and Ti(OiPr)2(thd)2 (thd = 2,2,6.6-tetramethyl-3.5-heptanedionate) dissolved in toluene were used as precursors. Evolution of film composition, surface morphology and microstructure with deposition conditions were studied. Microstructure of the films was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in Bragg-Brentano and Schulz geometries and by Raman spectroscopy. Epitaxial films on perovskite substrates consisted of dominant c-axis and minor a-axis textured zones (c-domains and a-domains). The amount of a-domains in films depended mainly on deposition temperature. The twinning in a- and c-domains was observed and twinning (tilt) angles depended on deposition conditions and on substrate. Fully twinned or partially twinned films can be obtained varying deposition conditions. The best quality epitaxial films were obtained on SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 at 650degC. Films on sapphire were mainly polycrystalline.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0015-0193			INSPEC:9684883

Two competing decomposition pathways, i.e., dehydrogenation of CH3OH to CO and H-2 and methanolic C-O bond scission, were observed by monitoring the time-dependent evolution of CO/CHxO and of carbonaceous deposits CHx (x = 0-3) via their vibrational and photoemission characteristics. Quantification of carbon-containing species was performed by XPS, while the preferred binding site of CHx was determined by SFG using CO as probe molecule for postreaction adsorption. In contrast to previous reports, Pd(111) was found to be quite active for methanolic C-O bond scission. The CH, formation rate strongly increased with pressure and temperature, leading to immediate catalyst deactivation at 0.1 mbar and 400 K. The combined SFG/XPS data suggest that the carbonaceous residues are highly dehydrogenated, such as CH or carbon atoms bonded to hollow sites. Complete dehydrogenation of CHx species and partial dissolution of atomic carbon in the Pd bulk most likely occurred even at 300 K. On the other hand, the CHx species was found to be unexpectedly thermally stable (up to similar to600 K), until carbon dissolution and formation of carbon clusters take place. Regeneration with oxygen above 400 K was able to remove CH, deposits and to partially restore the initial adsorption properties. Corresponding experiments with CO did not produce any carbon signals, indicating that the cleavage of the C-O bond must occur via CHxO intermediates (and not within CO). Methanol decomposition at pressures up to 15 mbar and temperatures up to 550 K, followed by gas chromatography, did not produce measurable decomposition products, due to fast carbon poisoning under catalytic reaction conditions.									83	0	2	0	1	0	85			1520-6106			WOS:000223430800049

XRD analysis showed that the alpha-MnO2 phase was of high purity and crystallized in the monoclinic space group I2/m, with 12 nm average crystallite size (D). After interaction with an organic pollutant (Phthalic acid, PA), excepting the pronounced decrease in beta angle, alpha-MnO2 cell parameters slightly changed, probably resulting from leaching of K+ cations. Adsorption isotherm of PA on alpha-MnO2 nanoparticles was fitted in L2 type Langmuir model. Accordingly, an outer-sphere PA-Mn surface complex was suggested. Further, the mineral oxide exerted a low activity in the decarboxylation of PA. Raman analysis illustrated the major bands, of alpha-MnO2, and their evolution after adsorption indicated the effect of PA on the phase structure, as revealed by the XRD Rietveld refinement. AFM analysis showed stick shaped nanoparticles with D = 15 nm, but the interaction with PA induced aggregation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-1556	2470-1564		WOS:000736525400005

Owing to its facile synthesis, stable physical and chemical properties, tunable structure, and suitable band gap, graphite-like carbon nitride $\left( {{\rm{g - }}{{\rm{C}}_3}{{\rm{N}}_4}} \right)$ plays an increasing role in the field of photocatalysis. It has attracted extensive attention in the fields of evolution of hydrogen and oxygen via water-splitting hydrolysis and in the degradation of organic pollutants. In particular, ${{\rm{g - }}{{\rm{C}}_3}{{\rm{N}}_4}}$ is identified to have a high specific surface area (SSA) because of its special lamellar structure. Meanwhile, the abundant pores intrinsic in it are able to provide both transporting channels for photogenic carriers or reactive species and a large number of active sites for redox reactions. These merits endow it with high photoelectrical properties. The preparation methods of the pore structures of such catalyst include hard templates, soft templates, and non-template ones. The hard template method enables the preparation of regular pore structures but requires additional removal treatment. However, the soft templates can be decomposed during the high-temperature preparation of ${{\rm{g - }}{{\rm{C}}_3}{{\rm{N}}_4}}$, which avoids the use of toxic reagents and consequently is harmless to the environment, and the template-free method does not involve any templates, which will simplify the experimental process from the aspect of sample preparation with reduced cost. In this paper, the advantages and disadvantages of various preparation methods were elaborated and compared based on the literature review in recent years. The developments and applications in the environmental and energy aspects were summarized by combining the commonly used modification methods, which provided the perceptions with respect to the development of metal-free ${{\rm{g - }}{{\rm{C}}_3}{{\rm{N}}_4}}$-based photocatalysts in the future. Further, the photocatalytic mechanism was explained, and the four different precursors of ${{\rm{g - }}{{\rm{C}}_3}{{\rm{N}}_4}}$ were compared. Finally, the ongoing outlook and perspectives will be covered in this review.			氮化碳作为一种具有高催化性能的光催化剂,具有无毒无害,自然环境下稳定的性质,在水解制氢气氧气以及降解有机污染物领域得到了广泛的关注.其中类石墨相氮化碳$\left( {{\rm{g - }}{{\rm{C}}_3}{{\rm{N}}_4}} \right)$因其特殊的片层结构而具有较高比表面积,常配合孔结构的构造,提供光生载流子及反应物质的运输通道以及大量活性位点用于氧化还原反应,是具有高光电性能的一种光催化剂.制备该种催化剂孔结构的方法有硬模板法,软模板法与非模板法,其中硬模板法需要在实验后除去模板,软模板法的模板会随着高温除去,非模板法的制备过程没有模板的参与.本文根据近年文献的整理,着重阐述和比较各制备方法的优劣,结合常用的修饰手段总结各制备方法的变化趋势和发展方向,并对后续研究中制备方法的使用前景做出判断.						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-9389			CSCD:6936222

The technique has been utilised to study the oxidation of one- and two-component systems. Results on the oxidation of Ni and Ni-Fe solid solution are reported for low values of the oxygen partial pressure, namely 0.3 Pa. X-Ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements at the Fe and Ni K-edges were made in fluorescence mode and after each oxidation step. The atomic selectivity of XAS makes this technique particularly suitable when studying selective oxidations. As indicated by the spectroscopic data, the oxidation of the Fe-Ni alloy mainly involves iron cations, and it leads to the growth of iron oxide, the formation of the ferrite being unfavourable. The oxidation kinetics are also obtained by an appropriate analysis of the spectroscopic data, and the parabolic rate constants have been evaluated. These results indicate that the technique is particularly suitable for studying the hot corrosion of oxide film too thick for common surface spectroscopy and too thin for conventional thermogravimetric technique.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0925-8388			WOS:A1995QN00400021

The performance of relevant samples in photocatalysis was studied under visible light. The efficiencies of the photocatalysts in degrading Rhodamine B followed the sequence of TiOF2/g-C3N4 > TiO2/g-C3N4 > g-C3N4 > TiOF2. In water splitting using Pt as a co-catalyst and triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial agent, the efficiencies followed the same sequence. Various tools were used to characterize the structures of the photocatalysts and understand the reasons for the superior performance of TiOF2/g-C3N4. Photocatalytic mechanisms involving TiOF2/g-C3N4 were proposed.									8	1	0	0	1	0	9			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000642466700003

This work reports a systematic study on the reaction mechanism of the formation of Pt-Ni seed-core-frame nanostructures via the seeded co-reduction method involving the Pt seeds and selective co-reduced deposition of Pt and Ni. The resultant structure consists of a branched Pt ultrafine seed coated with a pure Ni as rhombic dodecahedral core and selective deposition of Pt on the edges of the cores. Both the type of Pt precursor and the precursor ratio of Pt/Ni are critical factors to form the resulting shape of the seeds and eventually the morphology of the nanostructures. These complex hierarchical structures can be further graved into hollow Pt-Ni alloy nanoframes using acetic acid etching method. The larger surface area and higher number of low coordinate sites of the nanoframes facilitate the electrocatalytic activity and stability of Pt-Ni alloy for methanol oxidation as compared to their solid counterparts. This study elucidates the structural and compositional evolution of the complex nanoarchitectures and their effects on the electrocatalytic properties of the nanostructures.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2073-4344		WOS:000459732000039

Herein, the interfacial interactions and electronic properties of MoS2/graphene oxide (GO) heterojunctions with various O concentrations were explored systematically by first-principles calculations. The results indicate that MoS2 and GO can form a stable van der Waals heterojunction, and enhance the built-in internal electric field from GO to the MoS2 surface with the increase in O concentration after interfacial equilibrium. It is inferred that the photogenerated electrons and holes naturally accumulate in the conduction band of GO and the valence band of MoS2, respectively, under the built-in internal electric field driving, indicating the formation of direct Z-scheme heterojunctions. In addition, a red shift of the light absorption edge and the shift up of the conduction band edge of MoS2/GO heterojunctions are observed with an increase in O concentration. It can be concluded that the O atom plays a crucial role in the energy band alignment of MoS2/GO heterojunctions for the improvement of photocatalytic performance. These results are beneficial to understand and design layered MoS2/GO photocatalytic systems or as cocatalysts with other semiconductors.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000423019600065	29299566

Furthermore, constraint-based modeling of metabolic networks has become increasingly popular, which is appropriate for the systems-level reconstruction of cell physiology. The goal of the current study is to integrate a multiscale agent-based modeling framework with a constraint-based metabolic network model of cancer cells in order to simulate the three dimensional early growth of avascular tumors. In order to develop the integrated model, a previously published generic metabolic network model of cancer cells was introduced into a multiscale agent-based framework. This model is initiated with a single tumor cell. Nutrients can diffuse through the simulation space and the cells uptake or excrete metabolites, grow, proliferate or become necrotic based on certain defined criteria and flux values of particular reactions. The simulation was run for a period of 20 days and the plots corresponding to various features such as the growth profile and necrotic core evolution were obtained. These features were compared with the ones observed in other (experimental) studies. One interesting characteristic of our modeling is that it provides us with the ability to predict gene expression patterns through different layers of a tumor, which can have important implications, especially in drug target selection in the field of cancer therapy.									9	0	0	0	6	0	9			1742-206X	1742-2051		WOS:000408214300021	28737788

However, the value of PIC for in vitro and in vivo structural proteomics can be realized only if cross-linking reports accurately on biomacromolecule secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures with residue-specific resolution. Progress in this area requires rigorous and comparative studies of PIC reagents, but despite widespread use of PIC, these have rarely been performed. The use of PIC to report reliably on noncovalent structure is therefore limited, and its potentials have yet to be fully realized. In the present study, we compared the abilities of three probes, phenyl trifluoromethyldiazirine (TFMD), benzophenone (BP), and phenylazide (PA), to record structural information within a biomolecular complex. For this purpose, we employed a self-assembled amyloid-like peptide nanostructure as a tightly and specifically packed model environment in which to photolyze the reagents. Information about PIC products was gathered using mass spectrometry and ion mobility spectrometry, and the data were interpreted using a mechanism-oriented approach. While all three PIC groups appeared to generate information within the packed peptide environment, the data highlight technical limitations of BP and PA. On the other hand, TFMD displayed accuracy and generated straightforward results. Thus TFMD, with its robust and rapid photochemistry, was shown to be an ideal probe for cross-linking of peptide nanostructures. The implications of our findings for detailed analyses of complex systems, including those that are transiently populated, are discussed.									23	1	0	0	10	0	24			1554-8929	1554-8937		WOS:000333477300023	24372480

The primer set was designed to cover more diverse and longer sequences of cbbM genes than those reported previously. We analyzed various samples (i.e., benthic sands, basement rocks, sulfide chimneys, vent fluids and overlying bottom seawater) collected in a deep-sea hydrothermal field of the Suiyo Seamount, Izu-Bonin Arc, Western Pacific, by PCR-based analysis using the designed primer set. Most of the cbbM phylotypes recovered from the liquid samples were related to those of the SUP05 group that belongs to the Gammaproteobacteria and includes putative sulfide-oxidizing chemolithoautotrophs. In contrast, the cbbM phylotypes recovered from the solid samples were related to environmental clones with low similarity (74-90%) and not closely related to the SUP05 group (69-74%). The cbbM phylotypes recovered from the liquid samples were different from those of the solid samples. Furthermore, the cbbM phylotypes recovered from the solid samples were different from each other. Our results expand knowledge of the phylogenetic diversity and distribution of putative chemolithoautotrophs possessing RubisCO form II cbbM genes in deep-sea hydrothermal fields.									19	1	1	0	19	0	19			1431-0651	1433-4909		WOS:000301182300011	22212659

The specific growth rate of S. platensis was the highest at 100 gauss, being 1.5-fold that at 0.5 gauss, while the growth was obviously inhibited at 700 gauss. The existence of a magnetic field had no effect on the growth when S. platensis was cultured in the dark on a medium containing 0.3% glucose. The oxygen evolution rate during photosynthesis increased with increase in magnetic flux density, and the intracellular concentrations of sugar and phycocyanin, a light-harvesting pigment present in the thylakoid membrane in which reactions of the photosynthetic electron transfer system occur, reached maximal values at 100 gauss. At magnetic flux densities of a over 100 gauss, the phycocyanin content decreased with increase in magnetic flux density. The content of glyceroglycolipid, which exists exclusively in the thylakoid membrane, decreased with increase in magnetic flux density, especially so at 700 gauss, when it became 44% that at 0.5 gauss. From the aforementioned results, it is evident that magnetic fields accelerate the growth of S. platensis associated with activation of light excitation in the photosynthetic electron transfer system and increase in phycocyanin contents, and that these effects are maximal at magnetic flux densities of around 100 gauss. Nevertheless, when a magnetic flux density of over 400 gauss was applied, growth inhibition was observed with decrease in the phycocyanin content, and production of chemical energy necessary for sugar synthesis.									37	1	0	0	32	4	44			0922-338X			WOS:000077192300012

The XRD results have revealed the crystalline nature of syn-thesized NiO nanoparticles; the contact angle measurements for the adhesive nature of the NiO nanoparticles have been carried out and the films have been subjected to gas sensing studies by chemo-resistive method. The as-prepared BSA templated ionic liquid driven NiO based thin film sensor displays an ultrafast response for the room temperature detection of ammonia with an excellent response and recovery times of 38 and 13 s, respectively, towards a lower detection limit up to 1 ppm. The ultrafast sensing mechanism of the ammonia has been deduced with the aid of X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Furthermore, as-synthesized BSA/BSA-IL templated NiO electrodes have displayed excellent electrocatalytic water oxidation in alkaline media, with a collective water-splitting stable current density of 10 mA center dot cm 2. We have observed the HOMO-LUMO gap and the Valence Band/Conduction Band (VB/CB) position from the Bredas method calculations which clarifies the highest aptitude of NiO prepared with BSA-IL template for superfast ammonia gas sensing as the CB energy is significantly lower than that of NiO synthesized via the BSA template. The dual approach of multifarious applications for the ultrafast ammonia sensing and the corresponding electrochemical water oxidation through the bio-inspired NiO-nanoparticles is in fact one of the novel applications being cited in this paper. The results highlight the grave implications of as-synthesized NiO-nanoparticles as a brilliant cost-effective gas sensor and as an effective alternative electrode for sustainable energy harvesting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000842973300003

The acid combination solution of H2SO4/H3PO4 produces the improved oxidized hydrophilic GO without any evolution of hazardous gases instead of only H2SO4, which differentiates this procedure from the Hummers' method. Then, the synthesized GO is diminished to rGO by employing various reducers namely hydrazine hydrate, sodium borohydride and, ascorbic acid through the chemical route. The properties of synthesized materials have been investigated by diverse investigative systems that are X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM), Raman spectroscopy and, Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) which approved its high crystallinity and reduction of GO into rGO. EDS analysis confirms that the carbon to oxygen ratio is higher in rGO prepared by using hydrazine hydrate in comparison to rGO made by using sodium borohydride and ascorbic acid which reveals the good reducing capability of hydrazine hydrate. Hence, it may be concluded that the rGO synthesized by the reduction of GO in the presence of hydrazine hydrate is better as compared to others and it is expected that the synthesized material may be used for various applications.

Basalts close to the orebodies are altered, with gradational contacts to skarns. Variations of major and trace elements and delta Fe-57 values of low-Ti and high-Ti basalts reflect the role of both magmatic evolution and hydrothermal alteration. Negative correlations between delta Fe-57 and TFeO/TiO2 and between Na2O and TFeO/TiO2 of high-Ti basalts are explained by lighter Fe isotopes leached from basalts during water-rock reaction. Hence, we considered basalts as the main source of Fe. Magnetite precipitation was related to a retrograde skarn stage. Early-precipitated magnetite has lower incompatible trace elements (Lu, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta, and Yb), higher compatible trace elements (Co and Ni), and lower delta Fe-57 values than late-precipitated magnetite. Hydrothermal fluids equilibrated with early-precipitated magnetite (-0.11 parts per thousand to 0.16 parts per thousand) and late-precipitated magnetite (0.22 parts per thousand to 0.27 parts per thousand) have delta Fe-57 values of -0.38 parts per thousand to -0.11 parts per thousand and -0.05 parts per thousand to 0.00 parts per thousand, respectively. The isotopically heavier late-phase fluids indicate an increase of oxygen fugacity, in which Fe2+ was mostly oxidized to Fe3+. This is also consistent with reduced V concentrations from early-precipitated to late-precipitated magnetite. Our new data and previous geochronological results suggested that the 7918 Fe deposit records a continuous process of volcanic eruption, hydrothermal alteration, and Fe mineralization, which was related to a deep "magma chamber" formed at a subduction-related setting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1367-9120	1878-5786		WOS:000647610600001		
J	Xu, Yonghao; Guo, Yan; Liu, Qian; Bai, Jiale; Huang, Jingtao; Lin, Long; Lu, Shiqi								Antiferroelectricity in new silver niobate lead-free antiferroelectric ceramics (1-x)AgNbO3-xCaZrO(3) (x=0.00-0.01)								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				782				469	476		10.1016/j.jallcom.2018.12.206				APR 25 2019	2019	The critical need for clean energy has led to the development of lead-free electroceramics. However, lead-free antiferroelectrics seldom have been reported because of the difficulties in materials fabrication and their low electrical performance. In this work, we successfully synthesized lead-free antiferroelectric ceramics (1-x)AgNbO3-xCaZrO(3) (x = 0.00-0.01) using the solid state reaction method in flowing oxygen (O-2) atmosphere. Calcium zirconate (CaZrO3) dopant effectively stabilized the antiferroelectricity of silver niobate (AgNbO3) by dramatically decreasing the tolerance factor t. Additionally, we identified an orthorhombic Pbcm structure similar to that of pure AgNbO3. With the introduction of CaZrO3, phase transition temperatures M-1-M-2, M-2-M-3 and the freezing temperature T-f decreased. The shift of the M-1-M-2 phase transition temperature and T-f was the result of the restriction of the M-1 phase due to CaZrO3 substitution. The compositions of x < 0.001 displayed a double hysteresis loop with a raised critical field E-F. However, when the doping concentration exceeded 0.002, the double hysteresis loop with a higher polarization could not be obtained until the breakdown strength of E-B exceeded 200 kV/cm because of the tremendously enhanced free energy barrier between the virgin antiferroelectric state and the field-induced ferroelectric state. We also evaluated the polarization hysteresis loops are also evaluated at temperatures up to 100 degrees C for the compositions x= 0.00-0.005. With an elevated temperature, at which the free energy barrier was reduced, the double hysteresis loop was obtained at a lower electric field when compared with that at room temperature for the compositions x= 0.004 and 0.005. These results demonstrated that by adjusting the tolerance factor t and average electronegativity difference X, the antiferroelectricity could be predicted in AgNbO3-based lead-free solid solution systems, thus providing a new strategy for designing a new class of antiferroelectric materials.

In addition, the production of hydrogen from fossil fuels represents most carbon dioxide emissions from large chemical processes such as ammonia generation. Renewable sources of hydrogen such as hydrogen from water electrolysis need to be driven to similar production costs as methane reforming to address global greenhouse gas emission concerns. Water electrolysis has begun to show scalability to relevant capacities to address this need, but materials and manufacturing advancements need to be made to meet the cost targets. This article describes specific needs for one pathway based on proton exchange membrane electrolysis technology.									44	1	0	0	1	0	45			2451-9103			WOS:000502137600004

The tyrosine EPR signal width is increased relative to that observed in a manganese-depleted preparation due to a magnetic interaction between the photosystem II manganese cluster and the tyrosine radical. The manganese cluster is located asymmetrically with respect to the symmetry-related tyrosines Y-Z and Y-D. The distance between the Y-Z tyrosine and the manganese cluster is estimated to be approximately 4.5 Angstrom. Due to this close proximity of the Mn cluster and the redox-active tyrosine Y-Z, we propose that this tyrosine abstracts protons from substrate water bound to the Mn cluster.									261	1	0	0	153	0	261			0027-8424			WOS:A1995RZ07200024	7568170

Catal., 122 (1990) 126) we analyzed the geometry and energetics of the {100} face in terms of the crystallochemical model of active sites (CMAS), along with all possible butane-surface interactions and elementary steps. We indicated the structure and performance of the active cluster site for the discussed reaction and its energetically most favourable pathway. Analogous analysis is done in this work for other faces which (according to the electron microscopy studies) are exposed by (VO)2P2O7 Crystals: {001), {010}, {021} and {012}, including the crystallographically non-equivalent sections. It is shown that n-butane reacting on these faces encounters various geometric and energetic ''troubles'', much more important than those on {100}. They consist either in an non-convenient arrangement of active, undersaturated oxygens around the possible adsorption sites (hindering a bifurcated activation or bridging of the terminal methyl carbons), or in very high energy barriers for some elementary steps (especially for evolution of water and insertion or surface transfer of oxygen). These hindrances are responsible for the lower activity and selectivity of faces other than {100}. Consequently the catalytic anisotropy shown by (VO)2P2O7 in oxidation of butane is explained by CMAS. Based on the surface energy calculations and Curie-Wulff plot, it is also shown that in the state close to equilibrium, the area of the {100} face comprises only about 30 % of the total external grain area. Therefore any method of preparation which contributes to the development of the {100} face enhances strongly the activity and selectivity of the catalyst.									36	1	0	0	0	0	37			0304-5102			WOS:A1993MF49900009

The pure Co and Fe bilayer oxides both become hydroxylated by water exposure in vacuum conditions, albeit to a very different extent. It is however an open question how mixed oxides, exposing sites with a mixed coordination to Fe and Co, behave. By forming surface O species with a mixed Fe/Co coordination, we can investigate the nature of such sites. By means of scanning tunnelling microscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we characterize a series of Co-Fe oxides samples with different Fe contents at the atomic scale and observe a scaling of the hydroxylation degree with the amount of Fe inside the Co-Fe oxides. Our results indicate that the Fe dopants within the Co-Fe oxides have opposing effects on edge and basal plane sites modifying the maximum hydroxylation degree of pure cobalt oxide, perturbing the original binding sites of H, releasing the absorbed H or blocking the diffusion pathway of H.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0953-8984	1361-648X		WOS:000759142100001	35108698

Their performance hinges heavily on their structure, making the structural control of porous carbons a research frontier in their development. In addition to the straightforward hard-templating processes, soft templating synthesis is considered another appealing strategy for the precise engineering of porous carbons. We review recent progress on synthesizing porous carbon materials for energy storage and conversion using templating processes. First, the rise of this method of preparing porous carbons is outlined by comparing it with the traditional hard templating methods. Soft templating methods are then classified into top-down, state-change and bottom-up templates based on the template formation processes. The performance of these materials in electrochemical energy storage and conversion is presented, highlighting the advantages of this synthesis method. Finally, possible obstacles and future prospects are provided.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1007-8827	1872-5805		WOS:000780149400002

LDHs are potentially useful in a wide range of applications, particularly in environmental, energy, catalysis, and biomaterials related fields. Despite the unique intrinsic properties of LDHs, various functionalization strategies have been applied to LDHs that yield even more exciting performance opportunities, offering guides to design novel functional nanomaterials. In this review, we address how these strategies can improve the various properties of LDHs. We provide an overview of the functionalizing strategies of intercalation, surface modification, hybridization, layered compositions regulation, size and morphology control, and defect creation. These strategies contribute significantly to the enhancement of the performance of LDHs, across a diverse range of areas such as adsorptive, catalytic, electronic, electrochemical, and optical. As a result, functionalized LDHs exhibit great potential in a wide range of applications in the environmental and energy domains. We have comprehensively highlighted their emerging potential in the environmental, energy, catalysis, and biomaterials related fields, including heavy metal removal, radionuclide capture, organic contaminants purification, oil pollution elimination, hydrogen generation, supercapacitors, batteries, solar cells, catalysis, and biomaterial fabrication.									100	10	0	0	19	0	103			2051-6347	2051-6355		WOS:000519943400004

This can occur under physiological conditions but, in many cases, it has been associated to pathological process, including cancer. Lipoxidation may have an effect in cancer development through their effects in tumour cells, as well as through the alteration of immune components and the consequent modulation of the immune response. The formation of protein adducts affects different proteins in cancer, triggering different mechanism, such as proliferation, cell differentiation and apoptosis, among others, altering cancer progression. The divergent results obtained documented that the formation of lipoxidation adducts can have either anti-carcinogenic or pro-carcinogenic effects, depending on the cell type affected and the specific adduct formed. Moreover, lipoxidation adducts may alter the immune response, consequently causing either positive or negative alterations in cancer progression. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the effects of lipoxidation adducts in cancer cells and immune components and their consequences in the evolution of different types of cancer.									10	0	0	0	8	0	10			2213-2317			WOS:000498848200003	30658904

In a comparative fMRI study, we scanned a large cohort of human volunteers and untrained monkeys, as well as two monkeys trained to use tools, while they observed hand actions and actions performed using simple tools. In both species, the observation of an action, regardless of how performed, activated occipitotemporal, intraparietal, and ventral premotor cortex, bilaterally. In humans, the observation of actions done with simple tools yielded an additional, specific activation of a rostral sector of the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL). This latter site was considered human-specific, as it was not observed in monkey IPL for any of the tool videos presented, even after monkeys had become proficient in using a rake or pliers through extensive training. In conclusion, while the observation of a grasping hand activated similar regions in humans and monkeys, an additional specific sector of IPL devoted to tool use has evolved in Homo sapiens, although tool-specific neurons might reside in the monkey grasping regions. These results shed new light on the changes of the hominid brain during evolution.									234	2	1	0	176	1	237			0270-6474			WOS:000269834100013	19759300

The American journal of physiology				274	2			H591	9		10.1152/ajpheart.1998.274.2.H591				1998-02	1998	The nonspecific transaminase inhibitor aminooxyacetate (AOA) has multiple influences on the dynamics of 13C appearance in glutamate in rat hearts as measured by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) without altering O2 consumption or tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux. These include the following: 1) a reduced rate of 13C enrichment at glutamate C3 and C4; 2) a near coalescence of the C3 and C4 fractional enrichment curves; 3) a dramatic alteration in the time-dependent evolution of the glutamate C4 multiplets, C4S and C4D34; and 4) a decrease in the NMR visibility of glutamate. A fit of the 13C fractional enrichment curves of glutamate C4 and C3 in the absence of inhibitor to a kinetic model of the TCA cycle gave values for transaminase flux of 7.5 mumol.min-1.g dry wt-1 and TCA cycle flux of 7.5 mumol.min-1.g dry wt-1, thereby confirming reports by others that the kinetics of 13C enrichment of glutamate C3 and C4 in heart tissue is significantly affected by flux through reactions other than TCA cycle. The 13C fractional enrichment data collected in the presence of 0.5 mM AOA could not be fitted using this same kinetic model. However, kinetic simulations demonstrated that the time-dependent changes in C4S and C4D34 are only consistent with a 10-fold reduction in the size of intermediate pools undergoing rapid turnover in the TCA cycle. We conclude that inhibition of glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase by AOA effectively reduces the size of the alpha-ketoglutarate pool in rapid exchange with the TCA cycle. Our data indicate that changes in glutamate multiplet areas in the 13C NMR spectra of heart (as demonstrated by glutamate C4S and C4D34) are more sensitive to alterations in metabolic pool sizes in exchange with the TCA cycle than are measurements of 13C fractional enrichment at glutamate C3 and C4.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-9513			MEDLINE:9486263	9486263

The treatment of pollutants contained in wastewater coupled to energy recovery is an attractive solution to simultaneously reduce environmental pollution and provide alternative energy sources. Hydrogen represents a clean energy carrier for the transition to a decarbonized society. Hydrogen can be generated by photosynthetic water splitting where oxygen and hydrogen are produced, and the process is driven by the light energy absorbed by the photocatalyst. Alternatively, hydrogen may be generated from hydrogenated pollutants in water through photocatalysis, and the overall reaction is thermodynamically more favourable than water splitting for hydrogen. This review is focused on recent developments in research surrounding photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical hydrogen production from pollutants that may be found in wastewater. The fundamentals of photocatalysis and photoelectrochemical cells are discussed, along with materials, and efficiency determination. Then the review focuses on hydrogen production linked to the oxidation of compounds found in wastewater. Some research has investigated hydrogen production from wastewater mixtures such as olive mill wastewater, juice production wastewater and waste activated sludge. This is an exciting area for research in photocatalysis and semiconductor photoelectrochemistry with real potential for scale up in niche applications.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			2515-7655			WOS:000600095700001

Compared with the delafossite-structure, the MnO6 layers in Ca2Mn3O8 exhibit an ordered cation void which forms a magnetic 'bow-tie' like connectivity of Mn4+ ion layers separated by Ca2+ ions. In-situ variable temperature diffraction data demonstrates that the structure is robust up to a temperature of approximately 1173 K before the material decomposes into the perovskite, CaMnO3 and marokite, CaMn2O4 phases. Simultaneous thermal analysis suggests that a very small amount of water remains within the layers post synthesis. Impedance spectroscopy indicates that Ca2Mn3O8 is an electronic conductor in the range similar to 400-700 K with an activation energy of 0.50 +/- 0.01 eV. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The sample used in this work was isothermally pyrolysed in an open-medium system at temperatures ranging from 250 to 500 degrees C. A mass balance, a petrographic and geochemical characterisation of the pyrolysates and compositional and structural analyses (GC and NMR) of the generated oils were performed. The results confirm the association of huminite-resinous substances through covalent bonds and also point to the possible incorporation of aliphatic material via covalent oxygen bonds. The side-chains that serve as linkers between the phenolic subunits derived from the lignin contain more labile thermal bonds than those present in other vitrinites not affected by resin saturation. Consequently, this type of vitrinite undergoes a more intense degradation at lower temperatures than non-perhydrous and other hydrogen-rich vitrinites. The vitrinite network itself due to the incorporation of resin-like substances (cycloparaffinic in nature) may serve as a hydrogen donor, enhancing the hydrogenation processes during pyrolysis with respect to the-polymerisation and recombination reactions. The higher ability of hydrogen to stabilise the free radicals formed during pyrolysis explains the higher conversion to liquids at lower temperatures than in the case of non-perhydrous vitrinites. At the same time, this ability limits the growth of the aromatic structures. The evolution of the vitrinite modified by the presence of terpene-type resin is, thus, retarded with respect to non-perhydrous vitrinites, although in both cases the trend followed is very close. In contrast the trend of this type of vitrinite differs considerably from that of perhydrous vitrinites which are affected by hydrocarbon impregnation. Only for the most severe treatments (450/500 degrees C) was some degree of structural uniformity observed in the solid residues. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The resource utilization of the waste was investigated in a fluidized bed incinerator with a disposal capability of 10 t/d. The evolution characteristics of fluorine, operation conditions of the incineration system, absorption coefficient for HF by water washing, and HF corrosion during combustion were assessed. The results showed that HF and fluorocarbons were detected as the initial gaseous fluorides released during combustion. The release of HF could be divided into three stages, in which HF was generated from the volatilization of HF in the waste and the hydrolysis of fluorine in water-soluble salts (60-220 °C), oxidative decomposition of fluorinated organic components and residual carbon (220-800 °C), and hydrolysis of insoluble fluorinated inorganic minerals (800-1000 °C). Fluorocarbons could be destroyed through reactions with free radicals H, O, and OH or through single-molecule decomposition. Enhancing the temperature in the furnace and increasing the content of oxygen and hydrogen in the incineration materials were conducive to reducing the generation of fluorocarbons. By sampling and analyzing the bottom slag, bag filter ash and exhaust gas during the field test, the relevant pollutant discharge could meet the national emission standards. The waste heat utilization of high-temperature flue gas and the recovery of hydrofluoric acid and hydrochloric acid were realized. In the recovery of HF by water washing, the total absorption coefficients for 1 #to 4 #packed absorbers were 52.38 kg/(h m 2 ), 39.96 kg/(h m 2 ), 5.98 kg/(h m 2 ) and 3.89 kg/(h m 2 ), respectively. In the actual operation, alumina showed good corrosion resistance to high-temperature HF and could be used as bed materials or refractory materials.

Anatomical studies show that the human amygdala is not a single homogeneous structure but is composed of segregable subregions. These have recently been functionally delineated by using a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging (WRI) and cytoarchitectonically defined probabilistic maps. However, the response characteristics and individual contribution of these subregions to the processing of social-emotional stimuli are little understood. Here, we used this novel technique to segregate intra-amygdalar responses to facial expressions and nonsocial control stimuli. We localized facial expression-evoked signal changes bilaterally in the superficial amygdala, which suggests that this subregion selectively extracts the social value of incoming sensory information.

J	Pern, FJ								Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulants for photovoltaic modules: Degradation and discoloration mechanisms and formulation modifications for improved photostability								ANGEWANDTE MAKROMOLEKULARE CHEMIE				252				195	216		10.1002/apmc.1997.052520114				DEC 1997	1997	Long-term photothermal stability is needed for the polymeric encapsulants made of ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer used in crystalline-silicon (c-Si) based photovoltaic (PV) modules. Severe browning of EVA was observed in late 1980s on Carrisa Plains PV arrays installed with reflecting mirrors and resulted in large losses of the power output. The EVA browning crisis prompted NREL scientists in 1990 to investigate the problems and search for solutions. The key degradation mechanisms and discoloration factors were investigated by using a variety of film samples, including field-degraded EVA samples and two commercial EVA formulations, regular-cure A9918 and fast-cure 15295, that were laminated, cured, and subjected to accelerated environmental exposures. Chemical, thermogravimetric, absorption/transmission, colorimetric, and fluorescence analyses were employed to characterize the EVA samples. Current-voltage (I-V) measurements were used to determine the electrical performance characteristics of solar cells. The results show that photothermal degradation is greater than thermal degradation and that the EVA A9918 discolors earlier and faster than EVA 15295. The UV absorber, Cyasorb UV 531,((TM)) in commercial formulations decomposes photochemically and its decomposition rate is directly related to the temporal evolution of discoloring polyenic chromophores. In general, the loss rate of the UV absorber and the progress of EVA discoloration from light yellow to brown follow a sigmoidal pattern. Physically, W-filtering glass superstrates that remove UV less than or equal to 350 nm effectively reduce the discoloration rate of both commercial EVA formulations. Chemically, the EVA discoloration rate is affected by a number of factors, but more strongly by the formulation additives and curing conditions, in which additives and curing-generated chromophores and their concentrations show a synergistic discoloring effect. Photobleaching reactions are responsible for the non-discolored but degraded EVA because of oxidative destruction of the curing-generated chromophores in the presence of oxygen. By using specifically selected stabilizers and curing agents in the new formulations, a large reduction in the chromophore generation by curing has been achieved and resulted in significant improvement of the photostability against discoloration.					19th Annual International Conference on Advances in the Stabilization and Degradation of Polymers19th Annual International Conference on Advances in the Stabilization and Degradation of Polymers	JUN 09-11, 1997JUN 09-11, 1997		LUZERN, SWITZERLANDLUZERN, SWITZERLAND	87	1	0	0	0	0	88			0003-3146			WOS:000071167400015

Then, Ni-MOF was selected to prepare the amorphous carbon coated Ni2P composite materials by facile method. The composite material retained the lamellate shape of the precursor, and the BET surface area reached 202 m(2)/g. The Ni2P nanoparticles in the composites had good crystallinity, and the particles were homogeneous and had no reunion. In the performance of lithium ion battery, the Ni2P/C composite structure improved the electron and ion conductivity of the material while reducing the volume expansion of the material, thus improving the electrochemical properties of the material. The first charge and discharge capacity of Ni2P/C composite material were 247 and 226 mA.h.g(-1), respectively, coulombic efficiency can reach 91.7%, and the coulombic efficiency reaches 100% after 200 cycles.									4	3	0	0	0	0	4			0251-0790			WOS:000424914600003

Hydrothermal micas from many of the deposits are characterized by delta-D values of -75 to -53 per mil, and ore fluids were calculated to have values of -35 to -15 per mil. In contrast, extracted fluid inclusion waters have a broad range of delta-D values, from -48 in relatively undeformed quartz to about -110 per mil for some of the more deformed quartz veins. This range of more than 60 per mil reflects various mixtures from inclusions containing isotopically heavy, primary ore fluids and those containing low-temperature, isotopically light meteoric waters that were trapped in late fractures during uplift of the veins to shallow crustal levels. These results indicate a deep crustal source for the ore fluids, most likely of metamorphic origin. Values of delta-D for muscovite, biotite, and hornblende from country rocks, as well as of DELTA-18O for quartz-feldspar and quartz-plagioclase, provide little evidence of deep circulation of meteoric water along the length of the gold belt.The provinciality of delta-34S data suggests a regional metamorphic fluid of approximately -6 per mil that acquired much of its sulfur from lithologies near sites of ore deposition. Sulfur ratios of sulfide minerals from auriferous quartz range from -17.8 to -5.6 per mil in black phyllite hosts, from -6.0 to -1.3 per mil in less reduced metasedimentary rocks, and from -3.8 to +1.2 per mil in relatively oxidized igneous rocks. The regional fluid is interpreted to have driven desulfidation reactions in relatively S-34-depleted sulfur reservoirs in the phyllites and S-34-enriched reservoirs in the more oxidized lithologies.									135	16	1	0	0	2	146			0361-0128			WOS:A1991FC31400005		
J	Liu, Yang; Cheng, Xiaobei; Ya, Yuchen; Wang, Bowen; Zhang, Pu; Zhang, Kai; Xu, Yishu								Impact of PODE3 on soot oxidation reactivity at different stages in n-heptane/toluene diffusion flames								FUEL				331						125672	10.1016/j.fuel.2022.125672				JAN 1 2023	2023	PODE3, with the molecular formula of CH3O(CH2O)3CH3, is considered a highly competitive alternative fuel due to the absence of C-C bond and its high oxygen content, and have been shown to significantly reduce soot emission when applied as a diesel fuel additive. However, the effect of PODE3 addition on the oxidation reactivity of soot generated in the flame remains unclear which is of great importance for the optimal design of the post-treatment devices during its application. In this work, the impact of PODE3 (0 %, 10 %, and 20 % by volumetric fraction) addition on the oxidation reactivity of soot at different maturity and oxidation degrees in nheptane/toluene co-flow diffusion flames was specially investigated combining information on thermogravimetric analysis, high-resolution transmission electron microscope, and Raman spectroscopy. Results showed that PODE3 substitution significantly shrank soot generation region, and increased the flame temperatures before height above burner (HAB) < 45 mm. The addition of PODE3 improved the soot oxidation reactivity, which had a strong ability to hinder the growth of the microcrystalline carbon layers and resulted in a high content of amorphous carbon in soot particles. Specifically, it had more significant impacts on the soot in the oxidation stage than the surface growth stage. These can be explained that with PODE3 addition, on the one hand, the "reliable carbon atom" for soot formation is significantly reduced and the amount of oxidizing species is increased, resulting in a smaller particle size and a higher content of disordered and amorphous carbon in soot particles. On the other hand, the flame temperatures increased where HAB < 45 mm, which would promote the soot formation reactions. The combined effects of these factors make PODE3 have more significant inhibitory impacts in reactivity of soot sampled at oxidation stage than that at surface growth stage. Therefore, the impact of PODE3 addition on soot nanostructures and oxidation reactivity is not only reflected in its chemical effect but also in temperature effect.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000863053900004

Then, Pt NPs were deposited onto a Vulcan XC-72 powder to form carbon-supported Pt NPs catalysts. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out using parameters mimicking the deposition conditions of Pt in plasma sputtering experiments to determine key parameters for the growth of Pt NPs and to understand the growth mechanism at the atomic scale. MD simulations showed that Pt NPs growth depended on the kinetic energy of Pt atoms arriving onto the liquid substrate, which is related to the argon (Ar) pressure. The Pt NPs obtained for different Ar pressures and dispersed in glycerol were characterized by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to investigate the Ar pressure effect on Pt NPs size. Independently on the Ar pressure, SAXS results revealed the presence of two NPs populations. The first population is composed of isolated small NPs with an average diameter increasing from 1.8 to 3.2 nm with the pressure. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis performed on carbon-supported Pt NPs (Pt NPs/C) displayed the same diameter evolution, but the Pt NPs diameters were found to be slightly larger (from 2.5 to 3.7 nm) than those obtained by SAXS in glycerol. Both SAXS and TEM measurement revealed a second population of larger nano-objects that could correspond to agglomerates of individual small NPs from the first population formed either during the deposition in the liquid bulk or more probably at the liquid surface. The electrochemical behavior of the Pt NPs/C catalysts was studied in a conventional three-electrode electrochemical cell at room temperature in a N-2-saturated 0.50 mol L-1 H2SO4 electrolyte. It was shown that the Pt NPs size increased with argon pressure, which further led to a decrease of the Pt electrochemical surface area.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000619760700038

Recent advances in the development of lignin-based materials, such as mesoporous carbon, flexible thin films, and fiber matrix, have found their way into applications to photovoltaic devices, energy-storage systems, mechanical energy harvesters, and catalytic components. In this Review, we summarize and suggest another dimension of lignin valorization as a building block for the synthesis of functional materials in the fields of energy and environmental applications. We cover lignin-based materials in the photovoltaic and artificial photosynthesis for solar energy conversion applications. The most recent technological evolution in lignin-based triboelectric nanogenerators is summarized from its fundamental properties to practical implementations. Lignin-derived catalysts for solar-to-heat conversion and oxygen reduction are discussed. For energy-storage applications, we describe the utilization of lignin-based materials in lithium-ion rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors (e.g., electrodes, binders, and separators). We also summarize the use of lignin-based materials as heavy-metal adsorbents for environmental remediation. This Review paves the way to future potentials and opportunities of lignin as a renewable material for energy and environmental applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1864-5631			INSPEC:20999616

Here, we demonstrate a fast chemical synthesis, in which non-layered nickel boron oxide (Ni-Bi) in situ forms ultrathin 2D nanosheet arrays vertically aligned on both sides of graphene support, constituting a trilayered sandwich heterostructure. The realization of such an open framework heterostructure circumvents the aggregation issue and thus maximizes the exposure of the active sites of the nanosheets. In addition, the direct integration of the eletrochemically active material on conductive support ensures fast charge transport in the thickness dimension along with high structural integrity and durability. Proof-of-concept catalysis performance reveals exceptional photo/electro-catalytic reactivity and stability of the 2D-on-2D layered hybrid. This work highlights the capability and ease of fabricating ultrathin 2D heterostructures that are potentially useful for a wide range of environment-related applications.									90	7	0	0	11	0	90			2051-6347	2051-6355		WOS:000408590200012

Although metal doping and water-oxidation cocatalyst loading have been widely demonstrated to be useful to overcome the poor electron transport and slow water oxidation kinetics of BiVO4, the efficiency of this material is still greatly limited by poor charge separation. Various efforts directed at modifying the surface and bulk properties to improve the performance of BiVO4-based materials have therefore been developed, including crystal facet engineering, coupling with graphitic carbon material, annealing treatment, and nanoscaling. This review aims to provide insights into the most recent progress in these strategies in regard to their influences on the charge separation, transport, and transfer aspects of BiVO4, all of which are crucial to govern photochemical conversion efficiency. Understanding of these charge kinetics in relation to the properties of BiVO4 is of fundamental importance for rational design of BiVO4 with optimum structures, which may serve as a general guideline for the fabrication of metal oxide photocatalysts.									274	15	0	0	30	0	278			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000407641200003

Accordingly, in the present study, an efficient Z-scheme cage-structured Co9S8/g-C3N4 (c-CSCN) photocatalyst was constructed for the degradation of tetracycline antibiotics under visible-light irradiation. The Z-scheme charge-transfer mechanism accelerates the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and effectively improves photocatalytic activity. Moreover, c-CSCN has a hollow structure, allowing light to be reflected multiple times inside the cavity, thereby effectively improving the utilisation efficiency of solar energy. As a result, the photocatalytic activity of c-CSCN is 1.5-, 2.5-, and 5.8-times higher than those of sheet-type Co9S8/g-C3N4 (s-CSCN), c-Co9S8, and g-C3N4, respectively, for the degradation of tetracycline. c-CSCN maintains favourable photocatalytic activity over five consecutive degradation cycles, demonstrating its excellent stability. In addition, c-CSCN performs efficient tetracycline removal in different water substrates. Moreover, c-CSCN exhibits excellent ability to remove tetracycline under direct natural sunlight. This work fully demonstrates that c-CSCN has high catalytic activity and the potential for practical application as a wastewater treatment material.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000617431500017	33502403

The present paper discussed the mechanism and conceptual model of water-rock interaction by comprehensively investigating microcosmic characteristics of minerals and chemical characteristics of formation water in Xujiahe Formation of the study area,the result showed that different water-rock systems,host-rock matrices and backgrounds of formation water are the key reason for the difference in water-rock interaction mechanism between member 2 and 4 of Xujiahe Formation. Feldspar in Member 2 of Xujiahe Formation is effectively preserved due to a higher K~+/H~+ activity ratio,while the feldspar-depleted material source is the most significant reason for the absence of feldspar in Member 4 of Xujiahe Formation, moreover, the dissolution of feldspar caused by a lower K~+/H~+ activity ratio can also result in the lower concentration of feldspar. Feldspar dissolution, authigenic mineral precipitation and clay mineral transformation are controlled mainly by the slowest reaction process in the ternary system of feldspar corrosion,ionic migration(K~+) and illitization. Carbon and oxygen isotopes of carbonate cements indicated that Member 4 has an open water-rock system because of more acidic fluid than Member 2. The lack of organic CO_2 in Member 2 of Xujiahe Formation was supposed to be related with less acidic fluid,marine lime argillutite as a source rock and the denudation caused by tectonic uplift,and to be less affected by the fractionation of CO_2 migration. Based on these,we established conceptual models of water-rock interaction for aluminosilicate and carbonate rocks, respectively. Argillutite was proposed not to be a sealing factor but the first open object in a water-rock system, moreover, some argillutite(coal bed), as a material contributor and receiver, was thought indispensable in a whole water-rock system.			水岩相互作用是成岩矿物演化和地层水离子变化之间的桥梁,两者通过水岩反应达到水岩体系的平衡,呈现出此消彼长的关系,并留下了水岩相互作用的证据。本文通过川西坳陷中段须家河组储层成岩矿物的微观特征以及地层水离子地球化学特征等的综合分析,对其水岩相互作用机制及概念模式进行了探讨,认为研究区须家河组二段(简称须二段)和须家河组四段(简称须四段)不同的水岩体系、围岩基质及地层水背景是造成两者水岩作用机制存在差异的根本原因。由于较大的K~+/H~+活度比,须二段长石得到有效保存;须四段长石缺失的最重要原因是其本身的物源较为贫长石,同时,低K~+/H~+活度比导致长石溶蚀进一步降低了其中的长石含量。长石的溶解、自生矿物的沉淀和黏土矿物的转化主要受长石溶蚀-离子(K~+)迁移性-伊利石化三元体系中最慢反应进程控制。碳酸盐胶结物的碳氧同位素分析表明须四段的水岩体系更为开放,酸性流体数量大于须二段,须二段缺少有机CO_2记录,推测与酸性流体数量较少、烃源岩为海相灰质泥页岩及构造抬升剥蚀有关,CO_2运移分馏的影响较小。在此基础上,分别建立了铝硅酸盐和碳酸盐水岩作用概念模式,认为泥页岩并不是水岩体系中的封闭性因素,相反是水岩体系的第一开放对象,泥页岩(煤层)同时是物质提供者和接受者,是整个水岩体系不可或缺的部分。						5	23	0	0	0	0	28			0253-2697			CSCD:4748703

When SBBR was assisted by bioelectrochemical technology, the regulation of the electrode potential could realize the cccurrence and enhancement of the electrode dependent ammonium oxidation process. Further, the different anode potential levels could significantly affect the transformation performances and oxidation product types of ammonium in the system, as well as the associated microbial community structures. As the applied anode potential increased from 0.00 to 0.50 V, the strength of the electrode dependent ammonium oxidation process increased gradually in the SBBR, and the ammonia oxidation efficiency (AOE) and nitrite accumulation efficiency (NiAE) of the system increased to (97.071.20)% and (92.792.12)%, respectively. As the applied anode potential was higher than 0.80 V, the products of ammonium oxidation in SBBR mainly changed into nitrate owing to occurrence of oxygen evolution reaction on the working electrode. Moreover, the electrode dependent ammonium oxidation process began to be inhibited in the system due to the increased anode potential levels, deteriorating the AOE. Regarding to the bioelectrochemical assisted SBBR operating with the applied anode potential of 0.50 V, ideal ammonia oxidation effect [AOE=(99.330.11)%] and high level of nitrite accumulation amount [NiAE=(88.082.07)%] could be achieved when the system was used to treat domestic sewage at ambient temperature. Correspondingly, the electrode dependent ammonium oxidation process could be highly strengthened in the reactor, Nitrosomonas (the relative abundance of 33.54%), Geobacter (the relative abundance of 15.24%) and Empodebacter (the relative abundance of 16.88%) were the three dominant bacterial genera in the electroactive biofilm, which played key roles in the process of anaerobic ammonia oxidation.			针对常温下生活污水短程硝化难以实现且稳定性差的难题,探究了生物电化学措施对序批式生物膜反应器(SBBR)中NO_2~--N的累积性能及微生物学特征的影响。对SBBR施加生物电化学措施后,通过调控外加电极电势可实现其中电极氨氧化作用的发生及强化,且不同的外加阳极电势会显著影响系统中NH_4~+-N的转化效果、氧化产物类型及菌群结构。随着外加阳极电势由0.00增至0.50 V,SBBR中电极氨氧化作用的强度逐步提高,系统的NH_4~+-N氧化效率(AOE)与NO_2~--N累积效率(NiAE)分别增至(97.071.20)%和(92.792.12)%;当外加阳极电势≥0.80 V后,SBBR中NH_4~+-N的氧化产物因工作电极上的析氧反应转而以NO_3~--N为主,电极氨氧化作用的强度因电势不断升高而受到抑制,系统的AOE随之恶化。将外加阳极电势恒定为0.50 V,生物电化学强化型SBBR在常温下处理生活污水时可取得理想的NH_4~+-N转化效率(AOE=(99.330.11)%)与较高水平的亚硝酸盐累积量(NiAE=(88.082.07)%),此时系统中的电极氨氧化作用可得到较大程度的强化,其电活性生物膜中的优势菌属包括Nitrosomonas(33.54%)、Geobacter(15.24%)和Empodebacter(16.88%),三者在NH_4~+-N厌氧氧化过程中起关键作用。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1673-9108			CSCD:7211243

With unique topological structure, GYs display unusual semiconducting properties, especially in the aspects of charge mobility and electron transport. Among the members of the GY family, only graphdiyne (GD) can be successfully synthesized in large quantities. The advanced properties of GD make it promising in various applications. Here, the recent progress in the synthesis of GD and GD-based composites is reviewed as well as their applications in photorelated and electrocatalytic applications. It is hoped that this Review will promote the development and applications of carbon chemistry.									74	10	0	0	4	0	74				2198-3844		WOS:000453685900007	30581703

Bulk electrolyses of 250-mL aqueous solutions of 0.5 mM malachite green with 0.2 mM Fe3+ its catalyst have been carried out at room temperature and pH 3.0 under constant current in an undivided cell equipped with it graphite-felt cathode and a Pt anode to assess the performance of the electro-Fenton system. In situ electrogeneration of Fe2+ and H2O2 from quick cathodic reduction of Fe3+ and dissolved O-2 (from bubbled compressed air), respectively, allows the formation of the very oxidizing species hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) in the medium from Fenton's reaction. A pseudo-first-order decay kinetics with an apparent rate constant of k(LMG) = 0.244 min(-1) was obtained for total destruction of malachite green by action of center dot OH at 200 mA, requiring 22 min for total decoloration of the solution. lit the same experimental conditions, overall mineralization was reached ill 540 min. Up to 15 aromatic and short-chain carboxylic acid intermediates were identified along the treatment. The evolution of current efficiency was calculated from the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal. Based oil the time course of most of the by-products and the identification of inorganic ions released, some plausible mineralization pathways are proposed and thoroughly discussed. It has been found that the electro-Fenton degradation of malachite green proceeds via parallel pathways, all of them involving primary splitting of the triaryl structure initiated by attack of center dot OH on the central carbon, thus yielding two different N-dimethylated benzophenones. Successive cleavage of the aromatic intermediates generates oxalic acid as the ultimate short-chain carboxylic acid. whereas N-demethylation of some of them produces formic acid its well. Oxalic acid and its Fe2+ complexes, as well its formic acid, can be slowly but totally mineralized by center dot OH. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Monoalcohols are here investigated as solvents and reducing agents to obtain colloidal Os nanoparticles by using low-temperature (<100 degrees C) surfactant-free syntheses. The effect of the precursor (OsCl3 or H2OsCl6), precursor concentration (up to 100 mM), solvent (methanol or ethanol), presence or absence of a base (NaOH), and addition of water (0 to 100 vol %) on the resulting nanomaterials is discussed. It is found that no base is required to obtain Os nanoparticles as opposed to the case of Pt or Ir NPs. The robustness of the synthesis for a precursor concentration up to 100 mM allows for the performance of X-ray total scattering with pair distribution function (PDF) analysis, which shows that 1-2 nm hexagonal close packed (hcp) NPs are formed from chain-like [OsOxCly] complexes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2190-4286			WOS:000756032500001	35281627

The cobalt complexes 1 and 2 were supported on ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) by pi-pi stacking, resulting in heterogenized cobalt materials 6-FP-Co-OMC-1 and 5-FP-Co-OMC-2, respectively, and studied for electrocatalytic water oxidation. We find that 6-FP-Co-OMC-1 exhibits an overpotential of 355 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a turnover frequency (TOF) of similar to 0.53 s(-1) at an overpotential of 400 mV at pH 14. 6-FP-Co-OMC-1 exhibits activity that is similar to 1.6 times that of 5-FP-Co-OMC-2, which gives a TOF of 0.32 s(-1) at 400 mV overpotential. The structural stability of the single-atom Co site was demonstrated for 6-FP-Co-OMC-1 using X-ray absorption spectroscopy for the molecular complex supported on OMC, but slow degradation in catalyst activity can be attributed to eventual formation of Co oxide clusters. DFT computations of electrocatalytic water oxidation using the molecular complexes as models provide a description of the catalytic mechanism. These studies reveal that the mechanism for O-O bond formation involves an intermediate CoIV oxo complex that undergoes an intramolecular reductive O-O coupling to form a Co-II-OOH species. Further, the calculations predict that the molecular 6-FP-Co structure is more active for electrocatalytic water oxidation than 5-FP-Co, which is consistent with experimental studies of 6-FP-Co-OMC-1 and 5-FP-Co-OMC-2, highlighting the possibility that the ligand structure influences the catalytic activity of the supported molecular catalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000751835200038

In this work, we report the in situ. derivation of an iron phosphate-borate nanosheet array on carbon cloth (Fe-Pi-Bi/CC) from an iron phosphide nanosheet array via oxidative polarization in a potassium borate (KBi) solution. As a 3D catalyst electrode for water oxidation at mild pH, such a Fe-Pi-Bi/CC shows high activity and strong long-term electrochemical durability, and it only demands an overpotential of 434 mV to drive a geometrical catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with maintenance of its activity for at least 20 h in 0.1 M KBi.

Part 3: Formation of beta-NiOOH in Relation to the Polarization Potential, Polarization Time, and Temperature								ELECTROCATALYSIS				6	1			60	71		10.1007/s12678-014-0214-1				JAN 2015	2015	Electro-oxidation of surface beta-Ni(OH)(2) residing on metallic Ni to beta-NiOOH was studied in 0.5 M aqueous KOH at 277 K <= T <= 318 K by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chrono-amperometry (CA). The process is accompanied by a diffusion of H+ within the surface oxide phase. The formation of beta-NiOOH gives rise to an anodic peak in CV profiles, the potential of which depends on the scan rate (s). An analysis of the relation between the anodic peak current density (j (peak, AN)) and s indicates that the growth of beta-NiOOH is controlled by the diffusion of H+ and its modelling leads to the determination of the diffusion coefficient of H+ (D(H+)). In the case of 277 K <= T <= 318 K, the values of D(H+) are of the order of 10(-11) cm(2) s(-1), when calculated with respect to the electrode's geometric surface area (A (geom)), and of the order of 10(-12) cm(2) s(-1), when calculated with respect to the electrochemically active surface area (A (ecsa)). The activation Gibbs energy of H+ diffusion (Delta(diff) G (not equal)(H+)) is in the 19.5-22.6 kJ mol(-1) range. Chrono-amperometry transients for the formation of beta-NiOOH are analyzed on the basis of finite-space diffusion, with the assumption that beta-NiOOH can be formed through three mechanistic pathways. The values of D(H+) determined for both A (geom) and A (ecsa) using this approach are of the order of 10(-12) cm(2) s(-1). They are smaller than the analogous values of D(H+) determined on the basis of CV measurements but the values of Delta(diff) G (not equal)(H+) obtained using these two experimental approaches are comparable.									70	0	0	0	6	0	70			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000347454600007

Artificial imitation of such reaction systems is difficult as they involve complex protein structures. Global population increase and the associated rise in demand for food have become a vital concern in the present and therefore it is essential to develop methods to improve agricultural yields, enhancing photosynthesis could be key to this. An approach is the use of self-assembling systems which are embedded into plants to enhance the activity of photo-functional pigments. This review discusses various nanoparticle mediated artificially embedded photosystems used to enhance photosynthesis. It also includes the mechanisms of interaction between nanoparticles and photosystem for enhancing photosynthesis due to the involvement of a light-harvesting function. The use of self-assembling systems to improve photosynthesis could increase productivity of plants, particularly in regions or seasons with low duration of sunlight. Plant nanobionics offers scope towards embedding nanostructures into plant systems and supplementing them with additional properties to enhance the efficiency of plants in terms of resistance to pathogens, adaptability to abiotic and biotic stresses, in addition to improving sunlight harnessing ability and energy conversion. This review also highlights the importance of functionalised nanoparticles with tunable structures to produce desirable properties. A mechanistic view of the nanoparticle interaction with plants will help us realise the potential and facilitate appropriate application of nanoparticles in plants for photosynthesis enhancement.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2051-8153	2051-8161		WOS:000839568200001

To date, studies investigating the mechanisms of UV adaptation in algae have focused on physiological regulation and associated protein coding genes, with only a few reports on associated protein non-coding genes. In a previous study, we found that Cre-miR914 was significantly down-regulated in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in response to heat shock. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether Cre-miR914 plays a role in response to UV-B radiation. Our bioinformatics analysis indicated that the potential target gene of Cre-miR914 is ribosomal protein L18 (RPL18). We also measured the expression of Cre-miR914 and RPL18 in response to UV-B radiation through qPCR analysis. Then, we constructed cell lines overexpressing Cre-miR914 or RPL18, and performed survival experiments under UV-B stress. The results showed that Cre-miR914 overexpression decreased resistance while RPL18 overexpression enhanced tolerance to UV-B radiation. These results indicate that Cre-miR914 and its potential target gene RPL18 are involved in the adaptation to UV-B in C. reinhardtii.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0176-1617	1618-1328		WOS:000454881600018	30537602

However, rarely has investigation of the lithium storage behaviors been carried out except our first report on it.

Herein, we report on the synthesis, characterization and lithium intercalation mechanism of superstructure ZrV2O7 nanofibres that were prepared through a facile solution-based method with a subsequent annealing process. The thermal in situ XRD technique combined with the Rietveld refinement method is adopted to analyze the change in the temperature-dependent crystal structure. Benefiting from the nanostructured morphology and relatively high electronic conductivity, it presents acceptable cyclic stability and rate capability. According to the operando evolution of the XRD patterns obtained from electrochemical in situ measurements, the Li intercalation mechanism of the solid solution process with a subsequent conversion reaction can be concluded. Finally, the amorphous state of the electrodes after the initial fully discharged state can effectively enhance the electrochemical performances.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000390436800019	27849072

Laboratory experiments have proved that when water ices are irradiated with energetic particles, OH(H2O) are formed. Additionally, ground-state OH radicals may exist in the interstellar media, especially in dense interstellar clouds whose outer regions stop energetic particles. To this extent, the understanding of the reactivity of OH radicals in their ground state is of primary importance in the astrochemical context. We experimentally show that the co-injection of an OH radical beam with dilute water molecules leads to the formation of OH(H2O) complexes on copper rhodiated mirrors maintained at 3.5?K, under a pressure of 10-5 mbar.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000310064400032

The MFTB developed in mostly carbonate rocks with prominent lateral facies changes associated with two platforms and two basins. Fluids played a key role in the deformation, both physically and chemically, by reducing strength and inducing extensional fracturing through raised pore pressure and by providing the medium for solution transfer on the grain-scale. Veins preserve portions of water related to deformation as fluid inclusions. Lithology and lithological variations strongly control deformation styles, with thrusts dominant in the platforms and folds dominant in the basins, and also influence fluid behavior by controlling both porosity and permeability. Structural observations allow distinguishing veins (dominantly calcite) of several generations, emplaced early, during and late/after deformation (V1-V3 respectively). delta C-13 and delta O-18 analyses in calcite from veins and host rock show that the veins confined within thrust slices are isotopically buffered by the host rock and differ in isotopic composition from veins emplaced along major thrusts or crosscutting thrust slices. delta D analyses in fluid inclusions and clay minerals strongly suggest rock interaction with meteoric fluids in the west (hinterland) and with fluids close to SMOW in the less deformed eastern (foreland) side of the cross-section. By focusing on a single stratigraphic interval exposed across the width of the fold-thrust belt, we propose a conceptual model that explains the differences in vein-rock isotopic composition, the differences of in isotopic composition of aqueous fluids active during deformation, and the progression of clay dehydration reactions as being related to variations in temperature and intensity of deformation in a growing tectonic wedge.

It was found that alloys with X(Zn)0 less-than-or-equal-to 22 mol % are not dissolved at all. The dissolved zinc fraction, A, increased rapidly with further increase in zinc content and after having passed a maximum with A = 82-90% at X(Zn)0 = 55-58 mol % and a sharp minimum with A = 52-65% at X(Zn)0 = 65-69 mol %, it asymptotically approached to A --> 100% at X(Zn)0 --> 100 mol %. The discontinuous dependence of A against X(Zn)0 may be explained by differences in the crystallographic composition of the alloy deposits. Alloys with X(Zn)0 < 50-60 mol % can be allocated to solid solutions of zinc in the Ni matrix (alpha-phase); the range of 50-60 < X(Zn)0 < 70-80 mol % corresponds to the coexistence of alpha + gamma-phases. The pure gamma-phase exists within a narrow range at X(Zn)0 = 75-80 mol %. No zinc dissolution from Ni-Zn alloys with X(Zn)0 less-than-or-equal-to 22 mol % was explained by extremely low zinc activities in dilute solid solutions of the alpha-phases shifting the Gibbs energy of the dissolution reaction to very low negative, or even to positive values. The dependence of the hydrogen and oxygen overvoltage at j = 0.4 A cm-2 in 10 M KOH at 100-degrees-C on the original zinc content X(Zn)0 showed, in both cases, a clear minimum at X(Zn)0 = 75-78 mol %. This points to a practically pure gamma-phase in the original Ni-Zn alloy with an approximate composition NiZn3.									11	1	1	0	0	0	13			0021-891X			WOS:A1992JG13400005

Although some inorganic semiconductors have shown very promising activities, many suffer from low quantum efficiency and insufficient sunlight absorption or present environmental hazards. In recent years, conjugated polymer nanomaterials have rapidly become one of the most appealing candidates in photocatalysis, owing to their facile molecular functionalization, tunable optoelectronic properties, and good chemical stability. This essay highlights the recent advancement of conjugated polymer nanomaterials for solar water splitting.

However, it is rather critical how to maximize the capacity while keeping good cycling stability, which has impeded practical applications of Li-air batteries for decades. Although admirable achievements have been made in recent years, there are still many unsolved issues for developing practical Li-air batteries. In this review, the challenges are pointed out and the recent progress in cathodes, anodes, and electrolytes is also summarized for Li-air batteries, as well as the relationship between each part for better electrochemical performances. Furthermore, some inspiring results on constructing advanced Li-air batteries are discussed particularly. Finally, opportunities and perspectives are also provided.

It delivers high current density, with a Tafel slope of 36 mV/dec and a very small overpotential. The high exposure of MoS2 edges on the RuS2 NPs, the stronger d character of RuS2 and the electrical coupling of these two nanomaterials, grown together, were responsible for the high hydrogen production rates of 10.21/h (PEM cell 5cm x 5 cm, current density about 1.1 A/cm(2), power consumption 41.8 W, corresponding to 3.8 KWh/Nm(3) of energy consumption, efficiency 93%).

Despite the many similarities in structure, composition, and synthetic methods and uses, the current literature on layered oxides is diverse and disconnected. A number of reviews can be found in the literature, but they are mostly focused on one of the particular subclasses of 2D oxides. This review attempts to bridge the knowledge gap between individual layered oxide types by summarizing recent developments in all important 2D oxide systems including supported ultrathin oxide films, layered clays and double hydroxides, layered perovskites, and novel 2D-zeolite-based materials. Particular attention is paid to the underlying similarities and differences between the various materials, and the subsequent challenges faced by each research community. The potential of layered oxides toward future applications is critically evaluated, especially in the areas of electrocatalysis and photocatalysis, biomass conversion, and fine chemical synthesis. Attention is also paid to corresponding novel 3D materials that can be obtained via sophisticated engineering of 2D oxides.									73	3	0	0	6	0	73			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000459628200001	30132995	
J	Sun, Yupeng; Wei, Xin; Dong, Junhua; Chen, Nan; Zhao, Hanyu; Ren, Qiying; Ke, Wei								Understanding the role of alloyed Ni and Cu on improving corrosion resistance of low alloy steel in the simulated Beishan groundwater								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				130				124	135		10.1016/j.jmst.2022.03.037				DEC 10 2022	2022	The corrosion behavior of NiCu low alloy steel and Q235 low carbon steel as the candidate materials for geological disposal containers of high-level radioactive waste in the simulated Beishan groundwater was comparatively studied by weight loss test, electrochemical measurements, scanning electron microscope (SEM), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectrum and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electrochemical results showed that the corrosion potential of NiCu steel and Q235 steel gradually increased with the immersion time. Simultaneously, the cathodic process transited from hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) control to the rust reduction control, while the anodic process was always dominated by the active dissolution of iron. By comparison, both the cathodic resistance and the anodic dissolution resistance of NiCu steel corrosion were apparently higher than that of Q235 steel. The results of rust layer characterization indicated that Ni and Cu elements could be enriched in the inner rust layer of NiCu steel and the rust layer was more compact. As the main corrosion products, the content of alpha-FeOOH in the rust layer of NiCu steel was obviously increased more than that of Q235 steel. Fe 6 (OH) 12 SO 4 stably existed in the corrosion products of NiCu steel because Ni(II) or Cu(II) could substitute Fe(II) of Fe 6 (OH) 12 SO 4 and increased its oxidation resistance. Moreover, Ni and Cu could also make Fe 3 O 4 ionic selective by doping. After the long-term immersion, the corrosion mass loss of NiCu steel was significantly lower than Q235 steel, which further confirmed the benefits of Ni and Cu alloying on improving the steel corrosion resistance.

Starting from commercial TiO2 NPs, systematic evolution of TiO2-B, R-TiO2-B and R-TiO2-B:Cu NW-structures in steps, identified a gradual narrowing of band gap from 3.23 to 2.20 eV. Generation of Ti3+ and oxygen vacancy (O-v) related defect states in TiO2 lattice facilitates enhancing absorption of visible light and also inhibit faster charge recombination via trapping of photogenerated charge carriers. Cu2O nanoparticles intimately attached with TiO2 NW surface enhance the charge carrier separation via interfacial charge transfer between Cu2O and TiO2, involving direct Z-scheme mechanism. Further, metallic copper, being present with an intermediate band gap, can promote electron tunneling across Cu-Cu2O-TiO2 ternary hetero-junctions and dissociate more efficiently the photoexcited electrons and holes from individual pairs and make those amply available for dye degradation reactions which proceed more efficiently in spite of the reduced surface area and porosity of the hetero-structured photocatalyst. Strongly reductive electrons (e(-)) in the CB of Cu2O produce highly reactive superoxide radicals (O-center dot(2-)) which dominantly contribute in dye degradation, while hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) produced via oxidation by holes (h(+)) in the VB of TiO2 also degrade the dye molecules in a relatively lesser significance. The R-TiO2-B:Cu-0.2 NW catalyst degrades the MO dye very rapidly with a rate constant -0.41 min(-1) and an efficiency of dye degradation similar to 91%, and the MB dye even faster with a rate constant similar to 0.54 min(-1) and an efficiency of dye degradation of similar to 96%, during 60 min of visible light exposure, which are significantly high as compared to the data available in the contemporary literature.									19	1	0	0	2	0	19			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000512983600050

Among the hydrogen production methods, water electrolysis is a promising method because of its zero greenhouse gas emission and its compatibility with all types of electricity sources. Alkaline electrolyzers (AELs) and proton exchange membrane electrolyzers (PEMELs) are currently used to produce hydrogen. AELs are commercially mature and are used in a variety of industrial applications, while PEMELs are still being developed and find limited application. In comparison with AELs, PEMELs have more compact structure and can achieve higher current densities. Recently, however, an alternative technology to PEMELs, hydroxide exchange membrane electrolyzers (HEMELs), has gained considerable attention due to the possibility to use platinum group metal (PGM)-free electrocatalysts and cheaper membranes, ionomers, and construction materials and its potential to achieve performance parity with PEMELs. Here, the state-of-the-art AELs and PEMELs along with the current status of HEMELs are discussed in terms of their positive and negative aspects. Additionally discussed are electrocatalyst, membrane, and ionomer development needs for HEMELs and benchmark electrocatalysts in terms of the cost-performance tradeoff.									56	2	0	0	4	0	57			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000484129400005	30968481

To develop new materials for efficient energy transformation or storage are great challenges for the researchers. Due to the unique two-dimensional structure, high surface area, excellent electrical conductivity, and easy modification, graphene (GR) has attracted great attention in the energy-related fields. It has been proved that doping with nitrogen can significantly enhance the electrochemical properties of GR. Recently, more researches have shown that modifying the nitrogen-doped GR (N-GR) further by introducing a second heteroatom, such as boron, sulfur, and phosphorus, greatly improved electrochemical properties which could be obtained compared with mono-nitrogen-doped GR. This should be originated from the redistributed surface charge and abundant active sites led by the synergistic co-doping effect. This review will focus on the synthesis of nitrogen and a second heteroatom co-doped GR for energy-related applications, including energy transformation and storage. The enhanced mechanism by adding the secondary heteroatoms will also be discussed. We expected that this review will provide enriched information to harvest the excellent special properties of dual-doped GR materials for solving the energy problems.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000476796200001

The magnetic and photocatalytic properties of the powders were also investigated. The experimental results show that, when the content of TiO2 in the composite Y-La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/TiO2 is 3.51 wt%, the Y-La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/TiO2 exhibits stronger absorption in the UV-Vis light region. A composite p-n heterojunction was formed and had the lowest photoluminescence (PL) intensity, indicating a higher separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers and an enhancement of the photocatalytic activity of the Y-La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/TiO2 composite. Under solar irradiation, Y-La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/TiO2 shows an obvious synergistic photocatalytic effect on orange (MO) wastewater, and the synergetic index is calculated to be 1.79. Furthermore, it still exhibits high photocatalytic activity after being reused 8 times. Moreover, Y-La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/TiO2 displays soft ferromagnetic behavior, has much higher magnetization and lower coercivity and remanence. Therefore, Y-La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/TiO2 can be recycled by an external magnetic field more easily and can be used repeatedly. Radical trapping experiments confirmed that the main reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in the process of the photocatalytic reaction are the superoxide radical anion (center dot O-2(-)), hole (h(+)), and hydroxyl radical (center dot OH), and the sequence of the contributions of the ROS to the photocatalytic activity of the composite is center dot O-2(-) > h(+) > center dot OH. Furthermore, the photocatalytic mechanism of Y-La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/TiO2 is proposed in this work.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2046-2069			WOS:000413893000032

Srinivasan, Ramesh/0000-0002-2090-8257			Near-Real-Time Feature-Selective Modulations in Human Cortex								CURRENT BIOLOGY				23	6			515	522		10.1016/j.cub.2013.02.013				MAR 18 2013	2013	For neural activity to be linked with cognitive function, information is needed about both the temporal dynamics and the content of neural codes. Traditionally, recording of single neurons in animals has been the primary means of obtaining high temporal resolution and precise information about neural tuning properties such as selectivity for different sensory features. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in humans have been able to measure feature selectivity within specific subregions of sensory cortex (e.g., orientation selectivity in primary visual cortex, or V1) [1, 2]. However, investigating the neural mechanisms that support cognitive processing-which often occurs rapidly on a subsecond scale-with a temporally insensitive method such as fMRI severely limits the types of inferences that can be drawn. Here, we describe a new method for tracking the rapid temporal evolution of feature-selective information processing with scalp recordings of electroencephalography (EEG). We generate orientation-selective response profiles based on the spatially distributed pattern of steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) responses to flickering visual stimuli. Using this approach, we report a multiplicative attentional modulation of these feature-selective response profiles with a temporal resolution of 24-120 ms, which is far faster than that achieved with fMRI. Finally, we show that behavioral performance on a discrimination task can be predicted based on the amplitude of these temporally precise feature-selective response profiles. This method thus provides a high-temporal-resolution metric that can be used to track the influence of cognitive manipulations on feature-selective information processing in human cortex.									72	0	0	0	48	0	72			0960-9822			WOS:000316430000030	23477721

The Wunsiedel marble consists of calcite (ccl) and dolomite (dol) layers, Low REE contents, flat shale-normalized REEn patterns with a negative Ce anomaly, delta(13)C(PDB) values of -1.5 to 2 parts per thousand and a low Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio (0.7086) of the hydrothermally unaltered marble are typical for a sedimentary protolith formed within a marine environment. Hydrothermal alteration and talc mineralization of the marble occurs along a major fault zone and is associated with formation of massive saddle dolomite 2 (do2) replacing eel and dol. Massive dolomitization is followed by vug-filling carbonates, dolomite 3, calcite 2 and calcite 3. Each carbonate generation has a distinct chemical composition. Dolomite 2 is enriched in REE, depleted in O-18 (delta(18)O(SMOW) = 10.8 to 11.9 parts per thousand) and shows a higher Sr-87/Sr-86 value (0.7103) compared to the Wunsiedel marble (delta(18)O(SMOW) = 14.3 to 18.1 parts per thousand). Late stage vug-filling carbonates differ from the preceding (replacement) dolomite 2 by higher REE contents, a clear roof-shaped REE, pattern, enhanced radiogenic Sr isotope composition (Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.7115 and 0.7117) and lower delta(13)C(PDB) values (-2.6 to -11.5 parts per thousand). Main talc mineralization result from decarbonation reactions at low (CO2)-C-X and temperatures between 250 and 400 degrees C, It is proposed that main stage hydrothermal dolomitization, talc mineralization and late stage carbonate vug-fillings are related to formation brines or crustal fluids that interact with graphite-bearing metapelites under acid conditions. Changes in chemical composition between (early) replacement dolomite and (late) vug-filling carbonates are mainly ascribed to increasing fluid/rock ratios and decreasing temperatures.

The existence of OVs was confirmed by oS and low temperature electron spin resonance (ESR) technique. The crystal texture, morphology, and optical property of the 3D OVs-Bi2O3/Bi2SiO5 microsphere heterojunctions were analyzed by a series of characterization methods. The results reveal that OVs-Bi2O3/Bi2SiO5 heterojunctions were constructed and the diameter of microspheres is about 1 mu m. The photocatalytic performance of OVs-Bi2O3/Bi2SiO5 composite microspheres was assessed using methyl orange (MO) and colorless phenol as model contaminant. The synergistic effect of Bi2O3 and Bi2SiO5 greatly enhances the removal rates of organic pollutants. center dot O-2(-) and h(+) are predominant active free radicals in the photocatalytic process, supporting by ESR, nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) and trapping experiments. The separation and transfer of the photoinduced charge pairs of OVs-Bi2O3/Bi2SiO5 heterojunctions follow a step-scheme mechanism. The step-scheme mechanism endows OVs-Bi2O3/Bi2SiO5 heterojunctions with higher photocatalytic performance than the bare Bi2SiO5.									47	3	1	0	2	0	49			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000564208300011

Knowledge of the metal fluxes at the water sediment interfaces of reservoirs is essential for predicting their ecological quality. Redox oscillations in the water column are promoted by stratification; turnover events may significantly alter metal cycling, especially in reservoirs impacted by acid mine drainage (AMD). To study this phenomenon, an experiment was performed under controlled laboratory conditions. Sediment cores from an AMD-affected reservoir were maintained in a tank with reservoir water for approximately two months and subjected to alternating oxic hypoxic conditions. A detailed metal speciation in solid phases of the sediment was initially performed by sequential extraction, and pore water was analyzed at the end of each redox period. Tank water metals concentrations were systematically monitored throughout the experiment. The experimental results were then used to calibrate a diffusion-reaction model and quantify the reaction rates and sediment water fluxes.Under oxic conditions, pH, Fe and As concentrations decreased in the tank due to schwertmannite precipitation, whereas the concentrations of Al, Zn, Cu, Ni, and Co increased due to Al(OH)3 and sulfide dissolution. The reverse trends occurred under hypoxic conditions. Under oxic conditions, the fluxes calculated by applying Fick's first law to experimental concentration gradients contradicted the fluxes expected based on the evolution of the tank water. According to the reactive transport calculations, this discrepancy can be attributed to the coarse resolution of sediment sampling. The one-cm-thick slices failed to capture effectively the notably narrow (1-2 mm) concentration peaks of several elements in the shallow pore water resulting from sulfide and Al(OH)(3) dissolution. The diffusion-reaction model, extended to the complete year, computed that between 25% and 50% of the trace metals and less than 10% of the Al that precipitated under hypoxic conditions was re-dissolved during the oxic period. In contrast, only 22% and 9% of the Fe and As, respectively, that precipitated under oxic conditions were re-dissolved under hypoxic conditions. Overall, the results of the integrated annual balance, which also took the solid phase fluxes into account, demonstrated a net transfer of all studied elements to the sediment. In this AMD-affected reservoir, the sulfur cycle is the predominant control on the reservoir redox system; SO4 is the major oxidant of organic matter and S(II) is the major O-2 consumer, each accounting for nearly 90% of the total process in both cases.

In this study, using a novel straightforward electroless deposition method, multi-elemental alloys (FeCoNiCuZn) supported on graphite were prepared with controlled metal loading (HEA/g-X; X = 40, 80, 100) without any high temperature post-treatments. These materials were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction, and showed a composition ranging from 11 at.% to 31 at.% for each metallic element, a total metal loading varying from 1.3 to 5.2 at.% (5.9 to 21.5 wt.%), homogeneous distribution, and an amorphous structure. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, and chronoamperometry were used to evaluate the surface dynamics and the effect of the solution pH during the electrochemical hydrogenation of nitrobenzene using the HEA/g-40 material. The nitrobenzene conversion (>9 mmol(NB) g(cat)-(1) h(-1)) and aniline production (approximate to 4 mmol(AN) g(cat)-(1) h(-1)) rates in Na2SO4 solution (at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl) demonstrated a strong dependence on the applied potential. After comparing the results in alkaline medium (KOH), a competitive adsorption of species (nitrobenzene and H2O) was observed, showing a synergistic effect that greatly improved the selectivity of the nitrobenzene hydrogenation to aniline, from 23% in Na2SO4 to an outstanding 94% in KOH at the same applied potential, surpassing the results of a platinum electrode (34% in KOH). These results provide insightful information regarding the nature of the active sites involved in each step of the reaction mechanism, and gives useful means to develop new, tailored multifunctional HEA electrocatalyst materials.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000819946200001

We had recently pointed out that the classical explanations of- trans-membrane potential (TMP)-based chemiosmotic rotary ATP synthesis, quinone-cycle at cytochrome b(6)f, chartered electron transport by plastocyanin, and modality of light's interaction with chloroplast pigments- are untenable. In lieu, we proposed a diffusible reactive (oxygen) species (DROS)-based murburn model. In continuum, herein, we assess the operational viability of the cyclic oxygenesis and electron transport chain (ETC) explanations for oxygenic photosynthesis, in the light of updated structural/mechanistic information. Further, thermodynamically validated murburn equations of photolysis-photophosphorylation (Pl-Pp) are provided, along with the rationale for organelle-homeostasis. We propose that the photo-excitation of various pigments leads to the formation of aquated electrons (e(aq)) and DROS in milieu, which are stabilized by a pool of redox-active elements within chloroplasts. Subsequently, the 'e(aq)+DR(O)S' pool is utilized stochastically via disordered/parallel reactions at the stacked thylakoid membrane interface. Effective charge separation by 'photosystem switches' enables delocalized oxygenesis, NAD(P) reduction and ADP phosphorylation. Heat/TMP/DROS generation is also an outcome of this process. Finally, we compare the murburn and classical models of Pl-Pp and delineate agendas for their ratification/falsification. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Prospects for using this type of fuel cell at the level of energy systems are studied to a small extent. Fuel cells are highly efficient generators of electrical energy, which, unlike traditional heat engines, directly convert chemical energy of fuel into electrical energy through an electrochemical reaction, without intermediate stage of fuel combustion.The main aim of the research is to develop the concept of organizing highly efficient, sustainable at uneven power load energy systems based on methane-fueled protonic ceramic fuel cells, to calculate the technical parameters of the proposed systems based on the current-voltage characteristics of the elementary cells of fuel cells.Objects: protonic ceramic fuel cells with BZY20 and BCZYYB types of anodes; methane-fueled power, heat and hydrogen generating systems based on proton conducting ceramics.Methods: development of quasi-equilibrium models based on the current-voltage characteristics of elementary protonic ceramic fuel cells in the fuel cell and electrolyzer modes; analysis and description of the properties of promising developments in the field of proton conducting ceramics, a theoretical study of the behavior of this type of fuel cells when combined into energy complexes.Results. The authors have developed a quasi-equilibrium model of the energy system based on methane-fueled protonic ceramic fuel cells with cathode-anode recirculation and a partial transition to high-temperature electrolysis mode at partial power load. The main energy parameters of the system and the evaluation of efficiency are provided. The authors carried out the analysis of the phase diagram of the evolution of the fuel mixture composition at the anode in the vapor-oxygen reforming of methane by cathode-anode recirculation of gases. To determine the optimal operating point of the current-voltage characteristics, as well as to express the absolute efficiency of energy systems based on fuel cells, the "Effective power density" value was introduced.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2500-1019	2413-1830		WOS:000530211000002

The protein shell has a complicated structure with 24 subunits. Transmission electron microscopy images of ferritin showed nanosized iron oxides (ca. 4-6 nm) in the protein structure. In high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images of the iron core, d-spacings of 2.5-2.6 angstrom were observed, which is corresponded to d-spacings of ferrihydrite crystal structure. Our experiments showed that at pH 11, the modified electrode by this biomolecule is active for water oxidation (turnover frequency: 0.001 s(-1) at 1.7 V). Using affected by bacteria, we showed that Fe ions in the structure of ferritin are critical for water oxidation.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2045-2322			WOS:000479187800005	31395911

In the present study, a new water-soluble [Ce-III(DMF) (HSO4)(3)] complex was synthesized and characterized by UV-vis, photoluminescence, and high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques. Owing to classic 5d -> 4f transitions, an intense photoluminescence in the UV region was observed from the water-soluble [Ce-III(DMF) (HSO4)(3)] complex. A stacking electrode was designed where self-assembled L-cysteine monolayer modified gold was immobilized with the synthesized cerium complex and was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. The resulting electrode, i.e., [Ce-III(DMF) (HSO4)(3)] L-cysteine-Au stacks shows high electrocatalytic water oxidation behavior at an overpotential of eta approximate to 0.34 V under neutral pH conditions. We also demonstrated a way where the overpotential is possible to decrease upon irradiation of UV light.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000382179400020	27490440

Class II RNR of P. aeruginosa differs from all hitherto known class II enzymes by being encoded by two consecutive open reading frames denoted nrdJa and nrdJb and separated by 16 bp. Split nrdJ genes were also found in the few other gamma-proteobacteria that code for a class II RNR. Interestingly, the two genes encoding the split nrdJ in P. aeruginosa were co-transcribed, and both proteins were expressed. Exponentially growing aerobic cultures were predominantly expressing the class I RNR ( encoded by the nrdAB operon) compared with the class II RNR ( encoded by the nrdJab operon). Upon entry to stationary phase, the relative amount of nrdJa transcript increased about 6 - 7-fold concomitant with a 6-fold decrease in the relative amount of nrdA transcript. Hydroxyurea treatment known to knock out the activity of class I RNR caused strict growth inhibition of P. aeruginosa unless 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin, a cofactor specifically required for activity of class II RNRs, was added to the rich medium. Rescue of the hydroxyurea-treated cells in the presence of the vitamin B-12 cofactor strongly implies that P. aeruginosa produces a functionally active NrdJ protein. Biochemical studies showed for the first time that presence of both NrdJa and NrdJb subunits were absolutely essential for enzyme activity. Based on combined genetic and biochemical results, we suggest that the two-component class II RNR in P. aeruginosa is primarily used for DNA repair and/or possibly DNA replication at low oxygen tension.									26	0	0	0	24	0	26				1083-351X		WOS:000228615500006	15722359

A phenotypic series of transgenic plants was recovered that expressed intermediate and low amounts of PsbP. Chlorophyll fluorescence induction and Q(A)(-) decay kinetics analyses were performed. Decreasing amounts of expressed PsbP protein led to the progressive loss of variable fluorescence and a marked decrease in the fluorescence quantum yield (F-V/F-M). This was primarily due to the loss of the J to I transition. Analysis of the fast fluorescence rise kinetics indicated no significant change in the number of PS II beta centers present in the mutants. Analysis of Q(A)(-) decay kinetics in the absence of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea indicated a defect in electron transfer from Q(A)(-) toQ(B), whereas experiments performed in the presence of this herbicide indicated that charge recombination between Q(A)(-) and the oxygen-evolving complex was seriously retarded in the plants that expressed low amounts of the PsbP protein. These results demonstrate that the amount of functional PS II reaction centers is compromised in the plants that exhibited intermediate and low amounts of the PsbP protein. Plants that lacked detectable PsbP were unable to survive in the absence of sucrose, indicating that the PsbP protein is required for photoautotrophy. Immunological analysis of the PS II protein complement indicated that significant losses of the CP47 and D2 proteins, and intermediate losses of the CP43 and D1 proteins, occurred in the absence of the PsbP protein. This demonstrates that the extrinsic protein PsbP is required for PS II core assembly/stability.									94	3	0	0	89	0	94			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000248933000039	17604269

However, the nature of the strategies that fungal pathogens adopt to counteract host-derived oxidative stress is manifold and requires deep investigation. In this study, a superoxide dismutase (SOD) fromPuccinia striiformisf. sp.tritici(Pst) PsSOD2 with a signal peptide (SP) and the glycophosphatidyl inositol (GPI) anchor, strongly induced during infection, was analysed for its biological characteristics and potential role in wheat-Pstinteractions. The results showed thatPsSOD2encodes a Cu-only SOD and responded to ROS treatment. Heterologous complementation assays inSaccharomyces cerevisiaesuggest that the SP of PsSOD2 is functional for its secretion. Transient expression inNicotiana benthamianaleaves revealed that PsSOD2 is localized to the plasma membrane. In addition, knockdown ofPsSOD2by host-induced gene silencing reducedPstvirulence and resulted in restricted hyphal development and increased ROS accumulation. In contrast, heterologous transient assays ofPsSOD2suppressed flg22-elicited ROS production. Taken together, our data indicate that PsSOD2, as a virulence factor, was induced and localized to the plasma membrane where it may function to scavenge host-derived ROS for promoting fungal infection.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			1462-2912	1462-2920		WOS:000577403700001	32985748

The flower-like morphology of hexagonal ZnIn2S4 disperse on the SO-GCN nanosheets are evidenced by XRD, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The as-synthesized nanocomposites were intensively applied for the visible light photocatalytic removal of aqueous phase 2,4-D. The heterojunction creation and the well-developed combined interface between ZnIn2S4 and SO-GCN significantly increases its photogenerated charge separation capability. The photo-degradation mechanism disclose that the heterojunction has improved catalytic degradation activity, due to efficient transferring of photogenerated electron-holes pairs. Under visible-light irradiation, these nanocomposites showed 3-5 times higher degradation rate of 2,4-D (i.e. 0.0112/min, by 30%-ZnIn2S4/SO-GCN), as compared to solo ZnIn2S4 and SO-GCN, attributed to the composite's synergistic effect in unique 3D/2D heterojunction, that accelerates the electron-hole separation. The h(+) and center dot OH species contribute a noteworthy role in the degradation process of 2,4-D over 30%-ZnIn2S4/SO-GCN. In addition, the synthesized nanocomposites sustained their reusability performance in five cyclic run. Our research have implications of constructing 3D/2D nanocomposites which is beneficial for scalable solution of efficient photocatalysts. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The important miss factor determines the efficiency for each S transition. Commonly, an equal miss factor has been used in the analysis. We have used EPR signals which probe all S states in the same sample during S cycle advancement. This allows, for the first time, to measure directly the miss parameter for each S state transition. Experiments were performed in PSII membrane preparations from spinach in the presence of electron acceptor at 1 degrees C and 20 degrees C. The data show that the miss parameter is different in different transitions and shows different temperature dependence. We found no misses at 1 degrees C and 10% misses at 20 degrees C during the S-1 -> S-2 transition. The highest miss factor was found in the S-2 -> S-3 transition which decreased from 23% to 16% with increasing temperature. For the S-3 -> S-0 transition the miss parameter was found to be 7% at 1 degrees C and decreased to 3% at 20 degrees C. For the S-0 -> S-1 transition the miss parameter was found to be approximately 10% at both temperatures. The contribution from the acceptor side in the form of recombination reactions as well as from the donor side of PSII to the uneven misses is discussed. It is suggested that the different transition efficiency in each S transition partly reflects the chemistry at the CaMn4O5 cluster. That consequently contributes to the uneven misses during S cycle turnover in PSII.									19	0	0	0	13	0	19				1083-351X		WOS:000302903700076	22374999

Saremi, MOHSEN/W-3244-2018				Effect of polypyrrole coating modified by sodium fluoride and polyethylene glycol on corrosion behaviour of AZ31 magnesium alloy								MICRO & NANO LETTERS				11	12			866	869		10.1049/mnl.2016.0424				DEC 2016	2016	A polypyrrole (PPy) coating modified by sodium fluoride (NaF) and polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG) on AZ31 magnesium alloy is reported. The aim of this work was to obtain a composite coating with NaF and PEG in PPy matrix by electropolymerisation process. The idea was to form a stable PPy coating with higher resistance to corrosion damage. Prior to this process, the effect of sodium salicylate pre-treatment on PPy electropolymerisation was investigated by cyclic voltammetry technique. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and polarisation analysis was performed in 0.05 M NaCl solution to characterise the corrosion behaviour of each sample. EIS results showed that the addition of NaF and PEG could enhance the corrosion resistance (R-ct) of PPy coating. Also, the corrosion current density for NaF + PEG (incorporated in PPy) was demonstrated a value 60 times lower than that of bare AZ31 Mg alloy. The better corrosion behaviour of PPy composite coating with NaF and PEG was attributed to inhibition effect of fluoride which could act as barrier for Mg alloys. Moreover, PEG can stabilise the PPy structure because of its high oxygen content. Furthermore, the addition of NaF and PEG simultaneously could show a synergistic behaviour because of the positive effect of PEG on fluoride mobility.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1750-0443			WOS:000389323100021		
J	GarciaBerro, E; Ritossa, C; Iben, I				Garcia-Berro, Enrique/C-8034-2014; xu, tao/K-6631-2016				On the evolution of stars that form electron-degenerate cores processed by carbon burning .3. The inward propagation of a carbon-burning flame and other properties of a 9 M-circle dot model star								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				485	2			765	784		10.1086/304444				AUG 20 1997	1997	A 9 M. stellar model of Population I composition is evolved from the hydrogen-burning main sequence to the thermally pulsing ''super'' asymptotic giant branch stage, where it has an electron-degenerate core composed of an inner oxygen-neon (ONe) part of mass similar to 1.066 M. and an outer carbon-oxygen (GO) layer of mass similar to 0.05 M. and is experiencing thermal pulses driven by helium-burning thermonuclear flashes. The carbon-burning phase of the 9 M. model is in many respects similar to, but differs importantly from that of a 10 M. model studied earlier. In both cases, carbon is ignited off center, and a series of carbon flashes accompanied by a convective shell occur. In contrast to the 10 M. model, the 9 M. model experiences the second dredge-up phenomenon (the penetration of the base of the hydrogen-rich convective envelope inward into helium-and carbon-rich material) near the beginning rather than near the end of the carbon-burning phase. The first carbon-burning flash causes helium burning to shut down and the release of gravothermal energy (compressional and thermal energy) between the helium-carbon discontinuity and the base of the convective envelope plays a dominant role in the dredge-up event. Beginning with the third carbon-burning shell flash, the ''flame front,'' defined as being coincident with the base of the convective shell, propagates inward with a speed close to theoretical predictions that relate flame speed to local thermodynamic, opacity, and energy-generation rate characteristics. Ahead of the inward moving front, most of the nuclear energy released in a ''precursor flame'' goes into heating and expanding matter. As the precursor flame moves toward the center, its radial thickness decreases and, to follow the progress of the front with standard techniques, both the spatial grid size and the time step must be continually decreased. Following the front gives one the opportunity to ponder Zeno's paradox, which is averted because the thickness of the precursor flame remains finite. On reaching the center, the carbon-burning flame reverses direction and continues moving outward until it is within similar to 0.03 M. of the helium-burning shell. After carbon burning is completed, C-12 remains at a finite abundance throughout the electron-degenerate core of mass similar to 1.116 M. and is more abundant than Ne-20 in the outer similar to 0.05 M. of this core. Over most of the ONe interior of both the 9 and 10 M. models, Na-23 is more abundant than Mg-24: but th, maximum C-12 abundance in the 9 M. model ONe interior (X[C-12] similar to 0.048) is significantly larger than in the 10 M. model (X[C-12] similar to 0.012). For an ONe white dwarf that accretes enough matter to reach the Chandrasekhar limiting mass, this may make the difference between total explosive disruption (large C-12 abundance) and collapse to neutron-star dimensions (small C-12 abundance). The abundances in the CO part of the core have relevance for understanding the abundances in the ejecta of classical novae produced by massive ONe white dwarfs in close binaries. In the outer similar to 0.014 M. of the CO part of the core, the abundances of all neon isotopes are much less than solar, and Mg-25 and the neutron-rich isotopes made during the formation of Mg-25 are at a total abundance equal to the initial abundance of CNO elements in the model. As in the 10 M. case, thermal pulses occasioned by helium shell flashes begin after hydrogen is reignited and the carbon-burning luminosity drops below similar to 100 L..The time between pulses is similar to 400 yr, roughly twice as large as in the 10 M. model. After the ejection of the hydrogen-rich envelope as a planetary nebula, the remnant of the 9 M. model is expected to evolve into a white dwarf of mass similar to 1.15 M., the outer similar to 0.08 M. of which is composed of carbon and oxygen.									139	0	0	0	0	0	139			0004-637X			WOS:A1997XT24000027		
J	Miyake, C; Shinzaki, Y; Miyata, M; Tomizawa, K								Enhancement of cyclic electron flow around PSI at high light and its contribution to the induction of non-photochemical quenching of chl fluorescence in intact leaves of tobacco plants								PLANT AND CELL PHYSIOLOGY				45	10			1426	1433		10.1093/pcp/pch163				OCT 2004	2004	Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of Chi fluorescence is a mechanism for dissipating excess photon energy and is dependent on the formation of a DeltapH across the thylakoid membranes. The role of cyclic electron flow around photosystem I (PSI) (CEF-PSI) in the formation of this DeltapH was elucidated by studying the relationships between O-0-evolution rate [V(O-2)], quantum yield of both PSII and PSI [(D(PSII) and (D(PSI)], and Chi fluorescence parameters measured simultaneously in intact leaves of tobacco plants in CO2-saturated air. Although increases in light intensity raised V(O-2) and the relative electron fluxes through both PSII and PSI [Phi(PSII)xPFD and Phi(PSI)xPFD] only Phi(PSI)xPFD continued to increase after V(O-2) and Phi(PSII)xPFD became light saturated. These results revealed the activity of an electron transport reaction in PSI not related to photosynthetic linear electron flow (LEF), namely CEF-PSI. NPQ of Chi fluorescence drastically increased after Phi(PSII)xPFD became light saturated and the values of NPQ correlated positively with the relative activity of CEF-PSI. At low temperatures, the light-saturation point of (D(PSII)xPFD was lower than that of Phi(PSI)xPFD and NPQ was high. On the other hand, at high temperatures, the light-dependence curves of Phi(PSII)xPFD and Phi(PSI)xPFD corresponded completely and NPQ was not induced. These results indicate that limitation of LEF induced CEF-PSI, which, in turn, helped to dissipate excess photon energy by driving NPQ of Chi fluorescence.									75	7	1	0	74	0	81			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:000225086100009	15564526

More researches start focusing on this ancient immune system with the recognition the economic values of several species in this phylum, especially sea cucumbers. Here, we reported a study in the innate immunity of a sea cucumber species (Apostichopus japonicus) in response to infection of Vibrio splendidus. A novel differential expressed miRNA (miR-210) from the diseased sea cucumber coelomocytes was identified in our study. This miRNA molecule modulates Toll-like receptor gene (AjToll) expression via binding 3'UTR region from 906 nt to 930 nt. Upon the challenge of V. splendidus, coelomocytes in A. japonicas demonstrated a upregulation of AjToll but a downregulation of miR-210. Transfection of miR-210 agomirs in coelomocytes significantly depressed the expression of AjToll in cells. As a result of AjToll expression inhibition by miR-210, the AjToll downstream molecules involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also altered in vivo. This ROS pathway alternation was consistent with that caused by knockdown of AjToll through small inference RNA (siRNA). Taken together, the results of this study demonstrated a novel immune regulatory pathway via miRN-210 in A. japonica, which provides basic knowledge in exploring innate immunity of Echinodermata, and also can be reference in disease control in sea cucumber culture industry.

Of 61 studies of aquatic ectotherms, increased rearing temperature (apparently not stressful for growth and development) caused a reduction in organism size at a given developmental stage in 55 cases (90.2%) and an increase in only six (9.8%).2. The six exceptions to the size-reduction rule included one diatom (Phaeodactylum tricornutum), one copepod (Salmincola salmoneus) and four species of mayfly (Ephemeroptera). The extent to which these exceptions could be explained by each of four mechanisms was investigated by comparing their life cycles and niches with those of other closely-related species.3. No satisfactory explanation could be found for the response of P. tricornutum, but mechanisms consistent with the response of S. salmoneus were: reduced risk of oxygen shortage, low risk of ectotherm predation and seasonal constraints on the life cycle. The latter may also help explain the four mayfly exceptions.

An iron complex of N-methyl-D-glucamine dithiocarbamate was utilized as the spin trap. This spin trapping compound reacts with NO in solution to form a specific room-temperature stable, mononitrosyl complex which is readily detected and identified by EPR spectroscopy. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were placed in an EPR sample-cell and activated by lipopolysaccharide and gamma-interferon at 37 degrees C, followed by an additional incubation in oxygenated medium without these activation agents. After various incubation periods, spin trap solution was infused to replace the medium in the sample-cell, and the time-evolution of the EPR signal of the spin adduct (NO-complex) was recorded. Rates of NO generation were calculated based upon the initial slopes of the increase in the EPR intensity with time. In comparison to the NO (or NO2-) generation rate obtained under similar experimental conditions using the Griess reaction assay, the spin trapping method was found to be more sensitive, with a lowest limit of the detection of 3 pmol/min. Ln addition, by using the spin trapping method, NO generation from the same cells could be measured consecutively during various stages of activation, because infusion of the spin trap solution did nor affect the viability of macrophages.									87	0	0	0	69	2	88			0304-4165			WOS:A1996UG88300009	8620020

Herein a novel B and Fe co-doped SrTiO3 (B, F-STO) photocatalyst was successfully fabricated via a single-step sol-hydrothermal process. Various experiments confirmed that B and Fe are effectively doped into the STO matrix. Boron substituted oxygen anions, while Fe substituted Ti cations. UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) and valence-band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra confirmed that the band gap of STO significantly reduced from 3.4 to 1.9 eV upon co-doping with B and Fe. Hence, the B, F-STO photocatalyst exhibits more absorption (lambda <= 650 nm) compared to pure STO (lambda <= 360 nm). Further, from photoluminescence spectra, fluorescence spectra, and photoelectrochemical measurements, charge separation in STO is considerably enhanced by co-doping B and Fe. This resulted in the improved UV-vis light catalytic activities for CO2 conversion to CH4 and CO and H2O splitting to evolve H-2. The amounts of CH4 and CO produced over B, F-STO are similar to 17.2 and 21 mu mol, respectively, about 5-fold enhanced compared to that of STO (similar to 3.4 mu mol CH4 and 5.2 mu mol CO), and the calculated quantum efficiency at lambda = 420 nm is similar to 2.16%. Similarly, the amount of H-2 produced over B, F-STO is similar to 61 mu mol, about 6.7-fold enhanced compared to that over STO (9 mu mol), and the calculated quantum efficiency at lambda = 420 nm is similar to 2.12%. This work provides feasible routes to fabricate highly efficient SrTiO3-based nanophotocatalysts for solar-fuel production.									38	5	0	0	6	0	39			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000454367500025

CARBON AND BARIUM STARS IN THE GALACTIC DISK								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				446	2			775	792		10.1086/175835				JUN 20 1995	1995	We study the role played by nucleosynthesis processes in thermal pulses and by mixing episodes (the third dredge-up) in determining the abundances of intrinsic and extrinsic asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. This is done by comparing results from AGB models with observations of s-process and CNO nuclei in C stars (N-type) and in various classes of Ba stars (Ba dwarfs, CH subgiants, and Ba II giants) with metallicities typical of the disk population. The complementary information coming from abundances of Li and Mg isotopes is also discussed. According to a generally accepted scenario, the main neutron source at the origin of s-process nucleosynthesis is assumed to be the reaction C-13(alpha, n)O-16; a minor contribution derives also from the marginal activation of the reaction Ne-22(alpha, n)Mg-25 at the end of each flash. Making use of the latest neutron-capture cross sections and parameterizing the amount of C-13 burnt per pulse, we compute the nucleosynthesis occurring in the He shell and the dredge-up of material to the surface according to recent AGB models. Using envelope abundances after the first dredge-up derived from observations of first-ascent red giants and adopting standard prescriptions for mass loss, we succeed in fitting the photospheric compositions of C and Ba stars within their uncertainties. Our results confirm that C stars (N-type) are evolutionary descendants of normal (Tc-rich) S stars and are characterized by the same spread in mean neutron exposures (0.2-0.4 mbarn(-1)). As for the binary Ba stars, their abundances are compatible with the from an AGB primary component to a dwarf or giant secondary. We show that several constraints, including the Mg isotope ratios and the neutron density derived from the Rb/Sr ratio, require that s-processing occur in low-mass AGB stars but exclude the possibility that barium stars derive from primaries of intermediate mass (3 less than or equal to M/M. less than or equal to 8) efficiently burning the neutron source Ne-22. The s-process-enriched binary Ba giants show mean neutron exposures covering a wider range, reaching higher values (up to 1.0 mbarn(-1)) than for normal (single) C stars. An inverse correlation of the mean neutron exposure with metallicity is also present. Hence, the higher efficiency in s-processing shown by several Ba stars is interpreted as an indication that the metallicity range they cover is larger than for intrinsic AGB stars commonly observed. In fact, if the amount of primary C-13 burnt is roughly constant for the studied stars, their effectiveness in producing neutron-rich nuclei must increase (nonlinearly) toward lower metal contents. In this scenario the exponential distributions of neutron exposures provided by low-mass AGB stars can account well for the s-process abundances observed in Population I AGB stars, with no need to invoke strong single neutron exposures, as sometimes suggested in the past.									89	4	0	0	0	0	90			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:A1995RC75500032

Such evolutionary conservatism strongly suggests a physiological role for ATP binding that demands further investigation. We report the preparation of adducts of the protein and the affinity labels 8-azido adenosine 5'-triphosphate, adenosine 5'-triphosphate-2,3'-dialdehyde, and 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine. The two former reagents were seen to react at the arginine91-containing site, yet the reaction of the latter, although specific, occurred elsewhere, suggesting caution is necessary in its use. None of the adducts displayed significant modification of global structure, stability, or physicochemical properties, leading us to believe that the 8-N3-ATP and oATP adducts are good stabilized models of the noncovalent interaction; yet modification led to significant, and sometimes pronounced, effects on biological activity. We therefore propose that the role of ATP binding to this site, which we have shown to occur when the phosphorylation potential of the system is high under the equivalent of physiological conditions, is to cause a decrease in electron flow through the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Differences in the degree of inhibition produced by differences in adduct chemistry suggest that this putative regulatory role is mediated primarily by electrostatic effects.									24	0	0	0	22	0	24			0961-8368	1469-896X		WOS:A1993LD53500010	8391357

In particular, the pH of the CBD solution and its effect on the formation mechanisms of ZnO NWs and of nitrogen- and hydrogen-related defects in their center are still unexplored. By adjusting its value in a low- and high-pH region, we show the latent evolution of the morphological and optical properties of ZnO NWs, as well as the modulated incorporation of nitrogen- and hydrogen-related defects in their center using Raman and cathodoluminescence spectroscopy. The increase in pH is related to the increase in the oxygen chemical potential (mu(O)), for which the formation energy of hydrogen in bond-centered sites (H-BC) and V-Zn-N-O-H defect complexes is found to be unchanged, whereas the formation energy of zinc vacancy (V-Zn) and zinc vacancy-hydrogen (V-Zn-nH) complexes steadily decreases as shown from density-functional theory calculations. Revealing that these V-Zn-related defects are energetically favorable to form as mu(O) is increased, ZnO NWs grown in the high-pH region are found to exhibit a higher density of V-Zn-nH defect complexes than ZnO NWs grown in the low-pH region. Annealing at 450 degrees C under an oxygen atmosphere helps tuning the optical properties of ZnO NWs by reducing the density of H-BC and V-Zn-related defects, while activating the formation of V-Zn-N-O-H defect complexes. These findings show the influence of pH on the nature of Zn(ii) species, the electrostatic interactions between these species and ZnO NW surfaces, and the formation energy of the involved defects. They emphasize the crucial role of the pH of the CBD solution and open new possibilities for simultaneously engineering the morphology of ZnO NWs and the formation of nitrogen- and hydrogen-related defects.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2516-0230			WOS:000769903700001	36132162

The internal architecture and magmatic features of its crustal component suggest that the SSOC has a complex, multistage sea floor spreading history in a supra-subduction zone environment. The youngest crustal section associated with the propagating rift tectonics consists of a relatively complete ophiolite pseudostratigraphy, including basaltic volcanic rocks, a transition zone between the sheeted dyke complex and the extrusive sequence, sheeted dykes, and high-level isotropic gabbros. Large-scale variations in major and trace element distributions indicate significant remobilization far beyond that which would result from magmatic processes, as a result of the hydrothermal alteration of crustal rocks. Whereas K2O is strongly enriched in volcanic rocks of the extrusive sequence, Cu and Zn show the largest enrichment in the dyke complex near the dyke-volcanic transition zone or within this transition zone. The delta O-18 values of the whole-rock samples show a general depletion structurally downwards in the ophiolite, with the largest and smallest variations observed in volcanic rocks and the transition zone, respectively. delta O-18 values of epidote-quartz mineral pairs indicate 260-290 degrees C for volcanic rocks, 420 C for the transition zone, 280-345 degrees C for the sheeted dyke complex and 290-475 degrees C for the gabbros. The Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope ratios show the widest range and highest values in the extrusive rocks (0.70316-0.70495), and generally the lowest values and the narrowest range in the sheeted dyke complex (0.70338-0.70377). The minimum water/rock ratios calculated show the largest variations in volcanic rocks and gabbros ( approximately 0-14), and generally the lowest values and range in the sheeted dyke complex ( approximately 1-3). The dD values of epidote (-1 to -12%), together with the delta O-18 calculated for Ordovician seawater, are similar to those of present-day seawater. Volcanic rocks experienced both cold and warm water circulation, resulting in the observed K2O-enrichment and the largest scatter in the delta O-18 values. As a result of metal leaching in the hot reaction zone above a magma chamber, Zn is strongly depleted in the gabbros but enriched in the sheeted dyke complex because of precipitation from upwelling of discharged hydrothermal fluids. The present study demonstrates that the near intact effect of ocean floor hydrothermal activity is preserved in the upper part of the SSOC crust, despite the influence of regional lower greenschist facies metamorphism.					32nd International Geological Congress32nd International Geological Congress	AUG 20-28, 2004AUG 20-28, 2004		Florence, ITALYFlorence, ITALY	15	0	0	0	1	0	15			1038-4871	1440-1738		WOS:000234088300017

A phenotypic series of transgenic plants was recovered that expressed high, intermediate, and low amounts of these two manganese-stabilizing proteins. Chlorophyll fluorescence induction and decay analyses were performed. Decreasing amounts of expressed protein led to the progressive loss of variable fluorescence and a marked decrease in the fluorescence quantum yield (F-v/F-m) in both the absence and the presence of dichloromethylurea. This result indicated that the amount of functional photosystem II reaction centers was compromised in the plants that exhibited intermediate and low amounts of the manganese-stabilizing proteins. An analysis of the decay of the variable fluorescence in the presence of dichlorophenyldimethylurea indicated that charge recombination between Q(A)(-) and the S-2 state of the oxygen-evolving complex was seriously retarded in the plants that expressed low amounts of the manganese-stabilizing proteins. This may have indicated a stabilization of the S2 state in the absence of the extrinsic component. Immunological analysis of the photosystem II protein complement indicated that significant losses of the CP47, CP43, and D1 proteins occurred upon the loss of the manganese-stabilizing proteins. This indicated that these extrinsic proteins were required for photosystem II core assembly/stability. Additionally, although the quantity of the 24-kDa extrinsic protein was only modestly affected by the loss of the manganese-stabilizing proteins, the 17-kDa extrinsic protein dramatically decreased. The control proteins ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase and cytochrome f were not affected by the loss of the manganese-stabilizing proteins; the photosystem I PsaB protein, however, was significantly reduced in the low expressing transgenic plants. Finally, it was determined that the transgenic plants that expressed low amounts of the manganese-stabilizing proteins could not grow photoautotrophically.									123	8	2	0	114	0	131			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000228444800086	15722336

Growth was better in SC plants than in non-transgenic (NT) plants, which was related to elevated transcript levels of auxin-response genes. SC plants accumulated higher levels of GB under oxidative stress compared to the NT plants. In addition, SC plants exhibited increased tolerance to drought and salt stress, which was associated with increased efficiency of photosystem II activity. Finally, SC plants maintained lower levels of ion leakage and reactive oxygen species under cold stress compared to the NT plants. These observations suggest that SC plants might be useful for reforestation on global marginal lands, including desertification and reclaimed areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

These measurements provided an excellent opportunity to study OH and HO2 (collectively called HOx), and their sources and sinks in a polluted metropolitan environment. HOx generally showed the expected diurnal evolution, with maxima around noon of up to about 0.8 pptv of OH and 80 pptv of HO2 during sunny days. Overall, daytime observed OH and HO2 were a factor of 1.33 and 1.56 times modeled values, within the combined 2sigma instrument and model uncertainties. The chain length of HOx, which is determined from the ratio of the measured total OH reactivity that cycles OH to the total HOx loss, was on average 3 - 8 during daytime and up to 3 during nighttime, in general agreement with expectations. However, differences occurred between observed HOx behavior and expectations from theory and models. First, HO2 was greater than expected during daytime when NO mixing ratios were high; ozone production did not decrease as expected when NO was greater than 2 ppbv. Ozone production determined by the imbalance of the NOx photostationary state, which was almost twice that from HO2, also shows this dependence on NO. Second, the calculated OH production rate, which should equal the measured OH loss rate because OH is in steady state, is instead less than the measured OH loss rate by (1 - 2) x 10(7) molecules cm(-3) s(-1), with low statistical significance during the day and high statistical significance at night. Third, surprisingly high OH and HO2 mixing ratios were often observed during nighttime. The nighttime OH mixing ratio and the HO2/OH ratio cannot be explained by known reaction mechanisms, even those involving O-3 and alkenes. Because instrument tests have failed to reveal any instrument artifacts, more exotic chemicals or chemistry, such as OH adducts or other radicals that fall apart into OH inside the instrument, are suspected.									138	10	0	0	35	0	139			2169-897X			WOS:000186087200002		
J	Furukawa, Junichi; Yoshida, Yasuko; Williams, Forman A.								Structures of Methane-Air and Propane-Air Turbulent Premixed Bunsen Flames								COMBUSTION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				188	9	SI		1538	1564		10.1080/00102202.2016.1198335				2016	2016	Structures of turbulent Bunsen flames in the corrugated-flamelet regime were investigated by use of a three-color six-beam laser-Doppler velocimetry system. Four different mixtures with identical laminar burning velocities (0.34 m/s) were selected to facilitate comparisons-lean and rich methane, and lean and rich propane. A bimodal distribution, not previously reported in the literature on turbulent Bunsen flames, was observed in the radial component of gas velocity off-axis in the turbulent flame brush. Our previous measurements enabled the low-velocity-mode to be identified as velocity fluctuations of the unburned mixture and the high-velocity mode as fluctuations of the burned-gas radial velocity. Favre-averaged and Reynolds-averaged reaction-progress variables were then calculated from these bimodal distributions, identifying an initially unexpected region near the flame tips where, at a fixed radius, the average progress variable decreased (rather than increasing) with increasing height over a short distance, likely through enhanced flamelet flapping, which has not been predicted by modeling but which appears to occur quite generally for sufficiently tall turbulent Bunsen flames in quiescent ambient environments, for the corrugated-flamelet regime. Conditioned and unconditioned Favre-average velocity components and intensities also were calculated from the data for future tests of modeling. The distributions of the progress variables also clearly showed that the turbulent burning velocity of the rich propane flame was appreciably larger than that of any of the other three, as was its radial flame-brush thickness at any given height, and its high-radial-velocity mode had a higher average velocity magnitude than the others. Similarly, the turbulent burning velocity and flame-brush thickness appear to be smaller for the lean propane flame. These differences can be attributed to influences of preferential oxygen diffusion to turbulence-induced flamelet bulges, not included in existing modeling approaches, for the rich propane flames, and to a corresponding inhibition of fuel diffusion to the bulges in the lean flames. The former phenomenon is related to but different from the well-known cellular-flamelet instability, these effects occurring for flames that are stable to diffusive-thermal disturbances. It was concluded that a greater fraction of the total amount of heat release occurs in the upstream half of the turbulent flame brush in the rich propane flame, producing enhanced flow divergence in the upstream region, while the reduced ability of the slowly diffusing fuel to reach bulges in the lean flame generates the opposite effect. The results point to directions in which turbulent-combustion modeling needs to be improved, and an approach to modeling this type of preferential-diffusion effect is suggested.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0010-2202	1563-521X		WOS:000384069200009

The high surface energy of high-index ZnO crystal surfaces makes synthesis challenging to achieve due to their instability during crystal growth. In this work, we present a combined experimental and theoretical analysis of growth and photocatalytic activity of ZnO high-index crystal facets. Density functional theory calculations are performed to determine the thermodynamic conditions necessary to stabilize the high-energy semi-polar {11 (2) over bar2} facets of pyramidal ZnO nanostructures grown via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The photocatalytic properties of as-synthesized nanopyramidal structures for water splitting applications showed a 73% improved photocatalytic performance compared to CVD-grown hexagonal ZnO nanorods with dominating low-index {10 (1) over bar0} facets.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000580627000001

Improving intrinsic properties of BiVO4 is the basic requirement to solve serious recombination and establish efficient photocatalysts. To refine the intrinsic property of BiVO4, the morphology design is the primary strategy rarely investigated in previous works. In this study, the highly ordered cone-shape BiVO4 nanorod array is firstly fabricated on the conductive substrate via a facile solution process. Reaction time of the solution process is varied to fabricate different BiVO4 nanostructures and the possible growth mechanism of BiVO4 nanocone array is proposed. The highest photocurrent density of 1.00 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode is obtained for the BiVO4 nanocone electrode, owing to the highest crystallinity, preferable (040) crystal plane, the smallest charge-transfer resistance and the highest carrier density. Main contribution of this study is the fundamental improvement on photocatalytic ability of BiVO4 toward water oxidation. Incorporating other materials with BiVO4 to realize heteroatom doping or heterojunction are expected to improve the photocatalytic ability of the ordered BiVO4 nanocone array and fabricate efficient photocatalysts toward water oxidation.									20	3	0	0	0	0	20			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000483408400045

Forming multicarbon products in CO2 photocatalytic reduction remains very difficult, due to the kinetic barriers of C-C coupling. In this study, we introduce surface pentavalent tungstic (W5+) species in nonstoichiometric tungsten oxides via carbothermal reduction of commercial WO3 powder, achieving photocatalytic CO2 conversion with an aldehyde selectivity of 35% at a total normal CO2 conversion rate of 1.8 mu mol.g(cat)(-1).h(-1). The as-prepared nonstoichiometric tungsten oxides exhibit improved band structures and electron transport properties, and the W5+ surface species with oxygen vacancies play a pivotal role in facilitating C-C coupling of key intermediates. In-depth carbothermal reduction at an elevated temperature (880 degrees C) delivers more tetravalent W4+ species, decreasing the CO and aldehyde production rates. This work provides fundamental information to facilitate C-C coupling in CO2 photoreduction via the introduction of surface active species.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000566866700012

In this study, TaPP2C1 which belongs to group F2 was isolated and characterized from wheat. Expression of the TaPP2C1-GFP fusion protein suggested its ubiquitous localization within a cell. TaPP2C1 expression was downregulated by abscisic acid (ABA) and NaCl treatments, but upregulated by H2O2 treatment. Overexpression of TaPP2C1 in tobacco resulted in reduced ABA sensitivity and increased salt resistance of transgenic seedlings. Additionally, physiological analyses showed that improved resistance to salt stress conferred by TaPP2C1 is due to the reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, the improved antioxidant system, and the increased transcription of genes in the ABA-independent pathway. Finally, transgenic tobacco showed increased resistance to oxidative stress by maintaining a more effective antioxidant system. Taken together, these results demonstrated that TaPP2C1 negatively regulates ABA signaling, but positively regulates salt resistance. TaPP2C1 confers salt resistance through activating the antioxidant system and ABA-independent gene transcription process.									19	2	0	0	16	0	21			1932-6203			WOS:000356349000065	26057628

J	Terao, T; Katoh, S								Antenna sizes of photosystem I and photosystem II in chlorophyll b-deficient mutants of rice. Evidence for an antenna function of photosystem II centers that are inactive in electron transport								PLANT AND CELL PHYSIOLOGY				37	3			307	312		10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a028947				APR 1996	1996	Light-harvesting capacities of photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) in a wild-type and three chlorophyll b-deficient mutant strains of rice were determined by measuring the initial slope of light-response curve of PSI and PSII electron transport and kinetics of light-induced redox changes of P-700 and Q(A), respectively, The light-harvesting capacity of PSI determined by the two methods was only moderately reduced by chlorophyll b-deficiency. Analysis of the fluorescence induction that monitors time course of Q(A) photoreduction showed that both relative abundance and antenna size of PSIIalpha decrease with increasing deficiency of chlorophyll I, and there is only PSIIbeta in chlorina 2 which totally lacks chlorophyll b. The numbers of antenna chlorophyll molecules associated with the mutant PSII centers were, therefore, three to five times smaller than that of PSIIalpha in the wild type rice. Rates of PSII electron transport determined on the basis of PSII centers in the three mutants were 60-70% of that in the normal plant at all photon flux densities examined, indicating that substantial portions of the mutant PSTI centers are inactive in electron transport, The initial slopes of light-response curves of PSII electron transport revealed that the functional antenna sizes of the active populations of PSII. centers in the mutants correspond to about half that of PSIIalpha in the wild type rice. Thus, the numbers of chlorophyll molecules that serve as antenna of the oxygen-evolving PSII centers in the mutants are significantly larger than those that are actually associated with each PSII center, It is proposed that the inactive PSII serves as an antenna of the active PSII in the three chlorophyll b-deficient mutants of rice, In spite of the reduced antenna size of PSII, therefore, the total light-harvesting capacity of PSII approximately matches that of PSI in the mutants.									23	1	0	0	22	0	24			0032-0781			WOS:A1996UJ28900010

The as-fabricated hybrid nanofibers exhibited one-dimensional mesoporous morphology, a large BET surface area and uniformly distributed active sites (e.g FeCo alloy, Fe/Co-N). It elucidated that the co-existence of FeCo alloy and Fe/Co-N active sites could promote the catalytic activity of ORR and OER simultaneously. Essentially, the unique one-dimensional of nanofiber with observable porous morphology has indispensable contribution to charge transportation and exposure of active sites to O-2 adsorption when assembled into a rechargeable zinc-air battery. As a result, FeCo@MNC exhibited a low discharge-charge voltage gap (e.g. 0.9 V, discharge-charge at 20 mA cm(-2)), higher power density (e.g. 115 mW cm(-2), at 143 mA cm(-2)) and stability.									260	17	0	0	14	0	263			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000457952600015

Herein, defect-enriched NiV-layered double hydroxide nanosheets (NiV-LDH-NS) with a bimetallic synergistic effect were prepared by a one-step co-precipitation strategy as an electrocatalyst for phenol hydroxylation. The appropriate valence band of NiV-LDH-NS could provide a suitable thermodynamic driving force in electrochemical phenol hydroxylation and simultaneously avoid overoxidation. X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy (XAFS) revealed a defect-enriched structure (V-Ni and V-O) and low coordination structure (Ni-O and V-O) in NiV-LDH-NS. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and electrochemical characterization showed that these higher energy states within Ni and V resulted in intense electronic interactions and fast electron transfer in NiV-LDH-NS; meanwhile, the electron-rich defects accelerated the V4+/V5+ redox, generating hydroxyl radicals (OH) to participate in the electrochemical phenol hydroxylation. Analysis by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) further confirmed the existence of target product hydroquinone (HQ), which was optimally achieved with a 72.2% conversion of phenol and a 71.6% selectivity of HQ.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000759750600001

The Zhazigou deposit, which contains 27.27 Mt of ore reserves at an average grade of 0.64% WO3 and 0.02% Mo, is a large W-Mo deposit located within the East Qinling Orogenic Belt between the North China and Yangtze cratons. This study presents new scheelite mineralogical and molybdenite geochronological data for the deposit, and uses these data to explore the evolution of ore-forming fluids associated with the deposit and the processes that formed the mineralisation. The deposit is a redox-intermediate W-(Mo) skarn deposit, and records four stages of mineralisation, namely, skarn (I), quartz-scheelite (II), quartz-sulphide (III), and carbonate (IV) stages. The W mineralisation mainly developed during the quartz-scheelite stage (II), whereas the Mo mineralisation generally developed during the quartz-sulphide stage (III); trace molybdenite that coexists with scheelite formed during the quartz-scheelite stage (II). Re-Os geochronological analysis of molybdenite intergrown with scheelite yields a weighted mean age of 146.3 +/- 0.9 Ma that is consistent with a 145.4 +/- 2.6 Ma Re-Os isochron age and a 147 Ma zircon U-Pb age for the Yuku porphyritic granite, which is close to the Zhazigou deposit. The substitution of the rare earth elements (REEs) into scheelite is controlled predominantly by the reaction 3Ca2+ = 2REE3+ + Ca, which indicates that the REE characteristics of the scheelite in the Zhazigou deposit were inherited from the mineralising fluids. The REE and Sr-Nd isotopic compositions of the scheelite within the deposit are similar to those of the Yuku porphyritic granite, indicating that the ore-forming fluid was mainly magmatic in origin. Scheelite samples from the skarn and quartz-scheelite stages (I-II) have high Mo contents (up to 38930 ppm), whereas notably decreasing Mo contents (727-2629 ppm) characterise the quartz-sulphide and carbonate stages (III-IV). The changing redox state had a key role in affecting Mo abundances in the Zhazigou scheelite. A relatively oxidising fluid in the skarn (I) and quartz-scheelite (II) stages transformed into a reducing fluid in the quartz-sulphide (III) and carbonate stages (IV). Changes in the mineral assemblages from ferric- (e.g., andradite) to ferrous- (e.g., pyrrhotite) dominated also record these redox changes. The scheelite was precipitated as a result of fluid-rock interaction that released Ca2+ into the mineralising fluids. Oxygen fugacity exerted an important control on molybdenite precipitation, and a decrease in oxygen fugacity might have promoted the formation of scheelite, as well as the change from high- to low-Mo scheelite.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-1368	1872-7360		WOS:000671820100001

This degree of freedom is specified by the variable X(O) that expresses the atomic fraction of oxygen relative to oxygen + hydrogen. The only valid constraint on the maximum in the activity of GCOH fluid species is related to the bulk composition of the fluid, as can be expressed by X(O). In fluid-saturated graphitic rocks, mineral devolatilization reactions are the dominant factor is determining the redox state of the metamorphic environment. X(O) is directly proportional to the f(O2) of GCOH fluid, and because its value can only be affected by fluid-rock interaction, it is an ideal measure of the redox character and composition of GCOH fluid. Phase diagrams as a function of X(O) are analogous to the P-T-X(CO2) diagrams used for binary H2O-CO2 fluids; this analogy can be made rigorously if the C-O-H fluid composition is projected through carbon into the O-H subcomposition. After projection, the fluid is described as a binary fluid with the components O and H, and the compositional variable X(O). Description of GCOH fluids in this manner facilitates construction of phase diagram projections that define the P-T stability of mineral assemblages for all possible fluid compositions as well as fluid-absent conditions. In comparison to phase diagrams with variables based on the properties of fluid species, P-T-X(O) diagrams more clearly constraint accessible fluid compositions and fluid evolution paths. Calculated P-T-X(O) projections are presented for the C-O-H-FeO-TiO2-SiO2 system, a limiting model for the stability of Fe-Ti oxides in graphitic metapelites and phase relations in metamorphosed iron-formations. With regard to the latter, the stability of the assemblage qtz + mag + gph has been a source of controversy. Both the calculated C-O-H-FeO-TiO2-SiO2 system petrogenetic grid and natural examples, suggest that this assemblage has a large P-T stability field. Discrepancies between earlier C-O-H-FeO-SiO2 system phase diagram topologies are reconciled by the qtz + mag + gph = sid + fa phase field, a barometric indicator for metamorphosed-iron formations. A more general implication of calculated P-T-X(O) phase relation is that few inorganic mineral-fluid equilibria appear to be capable of generating hydrogen-rich, X(O) <1/3, GCOH fluids at crustal metamorphic conditions. The utility of P-T-X(O) diagrams derives from the use of a true compositional variable to describe fluid composition, this approach can be extended to the treatment of carbon-undersaturated sytems, and provides a simple means of understanding metasomatic processes of graphite precipitation.									96	7	1	0	4	0	101			0010-7999			WOS:A1995QK19300008

Influence of pseudo-boehmite peptization on structural properties, microstructure, chemical phases and attrition resistance was determined. With addition of acetic acid, the d(90) of boehmite agglomerates after 1 h kneading decreased from 134 to 40 mu m at pH 4. Due to this, the extrusion diameter was reduced from 1500 to 200 mu m, as well as median pore radii (from 30.1 to 5.3 nm). Porosity was about 70%. Addition of more than 1.87 M acid lead to a slight increase in mesopore sizes caused by some pore blocking caused by the formation of aluminium acetate salts. A small micropore surface was determined with t-layer model from Harkins and Jura. Higher attrition resistance was observed for samples peptized with lower acid concentration because of the closer contact between particles after decomposition.

An immediate practical example of such an approach is the development of sustainable methods for alcohol oxidation as alternatives to the current processes that are energy intensive and rely on ecotoxic chemicals. In this regard, heterogeneous photocatalysis has been identified as a robust technique to catalyze reactions under benign conditions, which would otherwise require harsh synthesis routes. With the advent of materials sciences and nanotechnology, there has been a tremendous increase in the scope of applicability of photocatalysis in fine chemicals synthesis. Though an attractive choice, much of the fundamental information pertaining to catalyst activity, selectivity and reaction conditions for optimum conversion are still to be investigated for most of these systems. To this end, this review will encompass recent achievements in the selective photocatalytic oxidation of alcohols by harnessing solar radiation as a viable source of energy. The discussion will be arranged based on common types of photocatalysts reported in literature, namely metal oxides (eg, TiO(2)and ZnO, Nb2O5), sulphides (eg, CdS, CuS, and Bi2S3), and carbonaceous photocatalysts (eg,g-C3N4). Several such candidates for photocatalysts will be discussed critically with the aim of providing useful insight into developing selective photocatalysts that can oxidize alcohols via eco-friendly pathways along with high yields.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0008-4034	1939-019X		WOS:000561952100001

Acid attack dissolved the octahedral sheets by interlayer and edge attack. The effects of the H2SO4 acid caused an exchange of Al3+, Fe3+ and Mg2+ with H. ions leading to a modification of the smectite crystalline structure. The Mg and Fe substitution in the octahedral sheets promoted the dispersion of corresponding layers and formation of amorphous silicon. The activated bentonites, after the treatment of sulfuric acid, exhibited a lower cation-exchange capacity (CEC)and significant increase of specific surface area from 6 to 387 m(2) g(-1) (bentonite from Petrovac) and from 11 to 306 m(2) g(-1) (bentonite from Aleksinac). The acid reaction caused a splitting of particles within the octahedral sheet which led to an increase in specific surface area and decrease in CEC in both bentonites. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

These abundances were derived from the HF (1-0) R9 line at 2.3357 mu m in high-resolution infrared spectra obtained with the Phoenix spectrograph on the Gemini South telescope. Many abundances in the target stars have been studied previously, so their overall abundance distributions are well mapped. The abundance of fluorine is found to vary by more than a factor of 6, with the F-19 variations being correlated with the already established oxygen variations and anticorrelated with the sodium and aluminium variations. In this paper we thus add fluorine to the list of elements known to vary in globular cluster stars, and this provides further evidence that H burning is the root cause of the chemical inhomogeneities. The fact that F-19 is found to decrease in the M4 stars, as the signature of H burning appears, indicates that the polluting stars must have masses greater than about 3.5M(circle dot), as lessmassive stars than this should produce, not destroy, fluorine.									84	0	0	0	0	0	84			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000232832500038

(1998) Biochemistry 37, 3581-3587]. Evolution of the Mn(II)-Mn(III) EPR signal proceeds through one or more intermediates [Goussias, C., Ioannidis, N., and Petrouleas, V. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 9261-9266]. In an effort to identify these intermediates, we have examined the time course of the signal evolution in the presence and absence of methanol. An early step of the interaction of NO with the WOC is the reduction of S-1 to the S-0 state, characterized by the weak Mn-hyperfine structure recently reported for that state. At longer times S-0 is further reduced to a state which has the properties of the S-1 state, in that single-turnover illumination restores the S-0 signal. The Mn(II)-Mn(III) state forms after the S-1 state and is tentatively assigned to an (iso)S-2 state, although lower states or a modified S-1 state cannot. be excluded at present. Following removal of NO 60-65% of the initial S-2 multiline signal size or the O-2-evolving activity can be restored. The data provide for the first time EPR information on a state lower than S-0. Furthermore, the low-temperature NO treatment provides a simple means for the selective population of the S-0, S-1 and the Mn(II)-Mn(III) states.									21	0	0	0	12	0	21			0006-2960			WOS:000077334800001	9843409

The base excision repair (BER) pathway corrects oxidatively damaged mutagenic bases and plays an important role in maintaining genetic stability. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship between BER functional polymorphisms and AML relapse. We focused on five major polymorphisms: OGG1 S326C, MUTYH Q324H, APE1 D148E, XRCC1 R194W, and XRCC1 R399Q. Ninety-four adults with AML who achieved first complete remission were recruited. Genotyping was performed with the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. The OGG1 S326C CC genotype (associated with lower OGG1 activity) was observed more frequently in patients with AML relapse [28.9 vs. 8.9%, odds ratio (OR) = 4.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.35-12.70, P = 0.01]. Patients with the CC genotype exhibited shorter relapse-free survival (RFS). Moreover, the TCGA database suggested that low OGG1 expression in AML cells is associated with a higher frequency of mutations. The present findings suggest that the OGG1 S326C polymorphism increased the probability of AML relapse and may be useful as a prognostic factor for AML relapse risk.									4	0	1	0	4	0	5			0925-5710	1865-3774		WOS:000441446700003	29737460

A series of methods have been developed to convert CO2 to valuable fuels and value-added chemicals to maintain the equilibrium of carbon cycles. The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is one of the promising methods to produce fuels and chemicals, and it could offer sustainable paths to decrease carbon intensity and support renewable energy. Thus, significant research efforts and highly efficient cat-alysts are essential for converting CO2 into other valuable chemicals and fuels. Transition metal-based single atoms catalysts (TM-SACs) have recently received much attention and offer outstanding electro-chemical applications with high activity and selectivity opportunities. By taking advantage of both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts, TM-SACs are the new rising star for electrochemical conversion of CO2 to the value-added product with high selectivity. In recent years, enormous research effort has been made to synthesize different TM-SACs with different M-Nx sites and study the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to CO. This review has discussed the development and characterization of different TM-SACs with various catalytic sites, fundamental understanding of the electrochemical process in CO2RR, intrinsic catalytic activity, and molecular strategics of SACs responsible for CO2RR. Furthermore, we extensively review previous studies on 1st-row transition metals TM-SACs (Ni, Co, Fe, Cu, Zn, Sn) and dual-atom catalysts (DACs) utilized for electrochemical CO2 conversions and highlight the opportunities and challenges.(c) 2022 The Authors.

Prior genetic studies have implicated Skp1 and its modification by these enzymes in O-2 regulation of development, suggesting the existence of an ancient O-2-sensing mechanism related to modification of the transcription factor HIF alpha by animal prolyl 4-hydroxylases (PHDs). To better understand the role of Skp1 in P4H1-dependent O-2 signaling, biochemical and biophysical studies were conducted to characterize the reaction product and the basis of Skp1 substrate selection by P4H1 and Gnt1. H-1 NMR demonstrated formation of 4(trans)-hydroxyproline as previously found for HIF alpha, and highly purified P4H1 was inhibited by Krebs cycle intermediates and other compounds that affect animal P4Hs. However, in contrast to hydroxylation of HIF alpha by PHDs, P4H1 depended on features of full-length Skp1, based on truncation, mutagenesis, and competitive inhibition studies. These features are conserved during animal evolution, as even mammalian Skp1, which lacks the target proline, became a good substrate upon its restoration. P4H1 recognition may depend on features conserved for SCF complex formation as heterodimerization with an F-box protein blocked Skp1 hydroxylation. The hydroxyproline-capping enzyme Gnt1 exhibited similar requirements for Skp1 as a substrate. These and other findings support a model in which the protist P4H1 conditionally hydroxylates Skp1 of E3(SCF) ubiquitin ligases to control half-lives of multiple targets, rather than the mechanism of animal PHDs where individual proteins are hydroxylated leading to ubiquitination by the evolutionarily related E3(VBC) ubiquitin ligases.									17	0	0	0	16	0	17			0006-2960			WOS:000287997000015	21247092

The particle-transferred Cu3VS4 photoelectrode with a Au-contacting layer (Cu3VS4/Au) showed much higher photocathodic performance for water reduction to produce H-2 under simulated sunlight irradiation (AM-1.5 G) than previously reported Cu3VS4/FTO prepared by a conventional drop-casting method. This drastic enhancement is due to the good contact between photocatalyst particles and the Au-contacting layer of the substrate electrode. Loading of a Pt cocatalyst was effective for further enhancement of the photocathodic performance of the Cu3VS4/Au photoelectrode. Pt(1 nm)-loaded Cu3VS4/Au gave about 4 mA cm(-2) of the cathodic photocurrent at -0.41 V vs NHE at pH7 that was four times higher than that without a Pt cocatalyst under simulated sunlight irradiation (AM-1.5 G). When Cu3VS4 particles with a small particle size were prepared by a flux method, better durability was obtained compared with a solid-state reaction. Efficient photoelectrodes based on a powdered metal sulfide utilizing whole range of visible light have successfully been developed by a particle transfer method, loading of a Pt cocatalyst, and a flux method on photoelectrochemical performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2162-8769	2162-8777		WOS:000803651400001

However, coupling two individual photocatalysts with an electron mediator by a one-pot strategy is still a challenge. Here, an all-solid-state Z-scheme Ta3N5/Bi/CaTaO2N photocatalyst is successfully fabricated for the first time through a simple one-step nitridation approach. Density functional theory calculation and experimental results prove that CaTaO2N and Ta3N5 are employed as a H-2-evolving and an O-2-evolving photocatalyst, respectively. In-situ formed metallic Bi acts as an electron mediator for charge transfer between Ta3N5 and CaTaO2N, facilitating an improvement of the photo generated charge separation efficiency. Therefore, in the absence of a sacrificial agent, Ta3N5/Bi/CaTaO2N exhibits an excellent photocatalytic overall water splitting performance under visible light irradiation. Meanwhile, an apparent quantum efficiency as high as 0.42% at 420 & PLUSMN; 15 nm is achieved, which surpasses most of the reported tantalum-based (oxy) nitrides photocatalysts. This work provides a new strategy for fabricating highly efficient and stable all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalyst for solar energy conversion.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000772755300001

In this study, beta-In2S3 nanosheets were first grown on conductive glass. Then, we prepared P-doped beta-In2S3 nanosheets with an amorphous InPOx overlayer via the incomplete phosphorization of pristine beta-In2S3 nanosheets. When we used this material as photoanode in a PEC cell for water splitting, the photocurrent density drastically increased to 2.2 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE). It enhanced 15 times as the pristine beta-In2S3 nanosheets, which was only 0.15 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE (solar standard spectrum, 100 mW cm(-2)). The photoelectric conversion efficiency as high as 0.65% at a low potential of 0.81 V vs. RHE was achieved for the phosphorized beta-In2S3 nanosheets. A series of experiments proved that the P-doping accelerated semiconductor charge-transport and the InPOx overlayer played cocatalyst role. We penetratingly investigated the pathway of charge transfer via femtosecond transient absorption. The results showed one pathway of charge transfer in pristine beta-In2S3 photoanode. However, there were two pathways (core/shell coupling and shallow trap states) for charge transfer in the phosphorized beta-In2S3 photoanode, which improved the performance of its PEC water oxidation.

In control chloroplasts, the whole chain and photosystem (PS) 2 reactions were drastically reduced under both irradiation and darkness. PS1 activity also showed significant reduction. In contrast to this, UV-B affected chloroplasts demonstrated high stability by slowing down the inactivation processes. Diphenyl carbazide and NH2OH restored the PS2 activity more in control chloroplasts than in UV-B chloroplasts. Mn2+ failed to restore the PS2 activity in both chloroplast samples. The loss in PS2 activity was primarily due to the loss of 33, 23, and 17 kDa polypeptides in control chloroplasts and to a marginal loss of them in the UV-B chloroplasts.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			0300-3604	1573-9058		WOS:A1996VA43300006

Analyses of the energy band structure, density functional theory (DFT) computations and DMPO-ESR spin-trapping experiments demonstrate that the formation of a perfect heterointerface with a staggered alignment of band edges between OCN and In2S3 (IS), owing to their close contact, enables photoexcited carriers to migrate via a Z-scheme route, which can maintain the higher reduction and oxidation capability of electrons and holes, respectively. Furthermore, the Z-scheme OCN/IS heterostructures efficaciously facilitate the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, as demonstrated using PL spectra, transient photocurrent densities and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). These lead to the enhanced photocatalytic activity towards reducing Cr(vi) into Cr(iii). Besides, the integration of OCN with IS can enhance the responsiveness to visible light based on the results of UV-vis DRS, thereby inducing the formation of more electrons and holes,and also contributing to the improvement of the photocatalytic activity for Cr(vi) reduction. In consequence, all the pre-prepared OCN/IS hybrids possess markedly improved photocatalytic activities for Cr(vi) reduction, relative to pure OCN and pristine IS under visible light (lambda > 420 nm) illumination. With the increase in the In(dedc)(3) to OCN mass ratio (R), the photocatalytic activities of these OCN/IS hybrids increase first and then decrease. The sample with an optimum R of 0.9 (OCN/IS-0.9) can remove nearly 100% of Cr(vi) after 40 min of illumination, being superior to most of g-C3N4-based and IS-based photocatalysts.

Chemical composition of hydrothermal apatite and metal contents in individual fluid inclusions of quartz and fluorite are investigated in order to understand the precipitation mechanism of U and to further constrain the origin of U and ore-forming fluids of the Zoujiashan deposit. Illitization, hematitization, and U mineralization successively occurred within rhyolite and porphyritic lava. Three types of hydrothermal apatite are identified. Apatite Type 1 (Ap1) and apatite Type 2 (Ap2) are both euhedral-subhedral crystals found in hematitization zone, while only Ap2 shows evident irregular chemical zoning along its rims. Apatite Type 3 (Ap3) occurs as anhedral aggregates closely associated with U-minerals in U ore veins, implying synchronous precipitation of Ap3 and U ores. Comparable chemical compositions of Ap1 and cores of Ap2, including similar high Cl content, indicate both of them were precipitated from a Cl-rich fluid that induced hematitization. The elevated F contents of Ap3 and rims of Ap2 implies that a F-rich fluid was involved and altered Ap2 during the main stage of U deposition. Ap1 and cores of Ap2 have lower Mn contents than Ap3 and rims of Ap2, indicating an oxidized character for the Cl-rich fluid and a reducing character for the F-rich fluid.Metal contents of fluid inclusions in fluorite and quartz occurring in U ores suggest that two end-members of fluids, including a U-rich and a U-poor, were involved in the main stage of U mineralization. Mixing between these two fluids led to the deposition of U- and Th-minerals through oxidation-reduction reactions and destabilization of Th-F complexes, respectively. The U-rich fluid is depleted in Th and Sr compared with the U-poor fluid. Based on comparison of chemical compositions of apatite and fluid inclusions, we suggest that the Cl-rich fluid precipitating Ap1 and Ap2 corresponds to the U-rich end-member fluid, while the F-rich fluid precipitating Ap3 represents a mixture between the two end-members. The high U (12.7-58.5 ppm) in the U-rich end-member fluid is in agreement with a relatively high oxygen fugacity and a surface-derived origin. The U-poor end-member fluid has lower Rb/Cs than the U-rich endmember and the unaltered host rocks, indicating the U-poor fluid was derived from a mantle wedge that experienced addition of Cs by fluids generated from the devolatilization of the subducted paleo-Pacific slab.									14	2	0	0	0	0	15			0169-1368	1872-7360		WOS:000491635200010

The wild type (Wt) and a chlorophyll b-less mutant (Wt-lhc) were used as a specific tool for the understanding of antenna role. Photosynthesis was monitored during and after UV-B stress by time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy and polarography. Carotenoids, such as neoxanthin, loroxanthin, lutein, violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, zeaxanthin, alpha- and beta-carotene, cellular and thylakoid-associated putrescine, spermidine, spermine and subcomplexes of light-harvesting complex (LHCII) of photosystem II (PSII) were investigated to assess their possible involvement in response to UV-B. Oxygen evolution depression by UV-B was higher in the Wt-lhc mutant than in the Wt. Photosynthesis recovery occurred in the Wt, but not in the mutant. The dissipation of excess excitation energy during UV-B stress was accompanied by changes in the thylakoid-associated polyamines which were much higher than changes in xanthophylls. We conclude that, at least in the unicellular green alga S. obliquus, mutants lacking chlorophyll b have significant lower capacity for recovery after UV-B stress. In addition, the comparison of xanthophylls and thylakoid-associated polyamines reveals that the latter are more responsive to UV-B stress and in a reversible manner.									38	1	0	0	36	0	39			0032-0935	1432-2048		WOS:000256522400010	18443817	
J	Bekri-Abbes, Imene; Srasra, Ezzeddine					Bekri-Abbes, Imene/0000-0003-2914-1635			Effect of mechanochemical treatment on structure and electrical properties of montmorillonite								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				671				34	42		10.1016/j.jallcom.2016.02.048				JUN 25 2016	2016	This study investigates the effect of grinding on the structure of montmorillonite (MMT). Both XRD and IR analyses indicate a gradual breakdown of the mineral layers and a decrease of the crystallinity with grinding. The prolonged grinding is accompanied with an amelioration of oxidant capacity of MMT which could be attributed to the conversion of structural Fe2+ to Fe3+ cations caused by adsorbed atmospheric oxygen and/or to the exposition of more Fe3+ cation to the surface of the mineral. The evolution of acidity of MMT during grinding has been carried out by determining the point of zero charge (pH(pzc)) of MMT and the pH of the aqueous suspension of MMT. It was shown that pH(pzc) increases with grinding from 6.2 to 8.1 respectively for untreated MMT and that ground for 30 min. On the other side the pH of MMT suspension increases from 4.75 to 8.18 respectively for untreated MMT and that ground for 75 min. These two results indicate that acidity of MMT has been lost during grinding. TGA analysis shows that the thermal decomposition of the ground MMT for 90 min takes place in a single step. This behavior has been explained by the formation of less tightly bound hydroxyl groups. Electrical and dielectric properties have been studied using impedance spectroscopy. It has been established that grinding is accompanied by an increase of dc conductivity and dielectric constant in the range of MHz. Moreover, it has been observed a shift of bound water relaxation frequency to lower frequency. These changes could be attributed to the enhancement of mobility of interlayer cations and to the perturbation of the state of interlayer water which could be connected to the defects in the octahedral sheet rather than being entirely localized at the interlayer space of MMT.

As compared with the bulk counterparts, 2D semiconductors tend to possess distinct photoexcitation processes and thus diverse photocatalytic behaviors, owing to the abundant surface structural factors and strong quantum confinement effects. Accordingly, enormous efforts have been devoted to exploring the relationship between the structure and photoexcitation processes in 2D semiconductors, for the sake of the optimization of photocatalytic performance. The attempts not only establish various new 2D semiconductor-based photo catalysts, but also provide in-depth understanding on the involved relevant mechanisms. Herein, an overview of recent advances in the exploitation of 2D semiconductors in photocatalytic applications is presented. By summarizing the investigations on structural characterization and photoexcitation processes, we highlight the relationship between structural factors and photocatalytic performance; in particular, the impacts of excitonic effects mediated by Coulomb interactions on photocatalytic behaviors are discussed. We conclude the review by exploring the future challenges and opportunities for the developments of 2D materials on photocatalytic areas.									92	6	0	0	11	0	93			0927-796X	1879-212X		WOS:000439676100001

In this Review, we present the most recent achievements in the past few years of synchrotron XAS techniques for the advanced investigation of hematite and other commonly used photoanodes. By focusing on the unique and powerful roles that XAS played in identifying the chemical compositions and exploring the working mechanism of various photoanodes, we will provide an in-depth understanding on how the XAS technique can guide the design of efficient photoanodes and contribute to the further development of PEC water splitting. The Review is also expected to stimulate more interest from the PEC community in general for taking advantage of XAS to facilitate their research.									29	2	0	0	2	0	29			2380-8195			WOS:000526311000036

In rising hydrothermal plumes, a combination of microbial metabolism and particle formation processes initiate the transformation of reduced chemicals like hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen, methane, iron, manganese and ammonia that are abundant in hydrothermal vent fluids. Despite the biogeochemical importance of this rising portion of plumes, it is understudied in comparison to neutrally buoyant plumes. Here we use metagenomics and bioenergetic modeling to describe the abundance and genetic potential of microorganisms in relation to available electron donors in five different hydrothermal plumes and three associated background deep-sea waters from the Eastern Lau Spreading Center located in the Western Pacific Ocean. Three hundred and thirty one distinct genomic 'bins' were identified, comprising an estimated 951 genomes of archaea, bacteria, eukarya and viruses. A significant proportion of these genomes is from novel microorganisms and thus reveals insights into the energy metabolism of heretofore unknown microbial groups. Community-wide analyses of genes encoding enzymes that oxidize inorganic energy sources showed that sulfur oxidation was the most abundant and diverse chemolithotrophic microbial metabolism in the community. Genes for sulfur oxidation were commonly present in genomic bins that also contained genes for oxidation of hydrogen and methane, suggesting metabolic versatility in these microbial groups. The relative diversity and abundance of genes encoding hydrogen oxidation was moderate, whereas that of genes for methane and ammonia oxidation was low in comparison to sulfur oxidation. Bioenergetic-thermodynamic modeling supports the metagenomic analyses, showing that oxidation of elemental sulfur with oxygen is the most dominant catabolic reaction in the hydrothermal plumes. We conclude that the energy metabolism of microbial communities inhabiting rising hydrothermal plumes is dictated by the underlying plume chemistry, with a dominant role for sulfur-based chemolithoautotrophy.									72	3	0	0	62	0	75			1751-7362	1751-7370		WOS:000366671300021	26046257

Material remained ductile even at low temperatures, which suppressed particle refinement, but promoted intensive plastic deformation of individual powder particles. Repetitive deformation of powder particles is similar to the multidirectional rolling and resembles bulk severe plastic deformation (SPD) methods. Initial and milled powders were compacted by spark plasma sintering. Sintered milled powder exhibited a refined microstructure with small beta-grains and submicrometer sized alpha-phase precipitates. The microhardness and the yield tensile strength of the milled powder after sintering at 850 degrees C attained 350 HV and 1200 MPa, respectively. Low ductility of the material can be attributed to high oxygen content originating from the cryogenic milling. This pioneering work shows that cryogenic milling followed by spark plasma sintering is able to produce two-phase beta-Ti alloys with refined microstructure and very high strength levels.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2075-4701		WOS:000506637800041

The construction of core-shelltype nanostructures by coupling of the earth-abundant hydrogen generation catalyst Mo2C to the good photoabsorber CdS may be the best combination for photocatalytic hydrogen generation reaction. Thus, in this work, core-shell nanorods consisting of a CdS core and a Mo2C-C shell have been designed and synthesized for the first time. The as-prepared CdS@Mo2C-C nanorods display an excellent hydrogen generation rate of 17.24 mmol h(-1) g(-1) relative to pure CdS, which may result from the unique one-dimensional nanostructure, the strong interfacial interaction between the core and shell materials, as well as the broadened visible-light absorption range. What's more, the existence of C layers in the core-shell nanorods can facilitate transfer of the photogenerated holes to the outer shell of Mo2C-C, and thus protect the inner CdS from photocorrosion to finally achieve high photostability of the catalyst.									55	3	0	0	6	0	55			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000406672400044

The reaction time is optimized for a high precursor yield and the homogeneity of the final product. The fabricated electrodes with varying amounts of active material and conducting carbon show better electrochemical activity for 50 : 50 weight ratio combinations as extrinsic pseudocapacitors. The optimized NNMO-3 electrode (obtained from the Ni-Mo hydroxide precursor during the 10 h reaction time) exhibits superior performance among all the tested nanocomposite electrodes like a high specific capacity of 649.8 C g(-1) (1624.5 F g(-1)) and 73.5% retention of capacity after 2200 cycles at a specific current of 1.0 A g(-1) along with satisfactory rate capability (42.5% retention after a ten-times increment in specific current), which may be attributed to the abundant electroactive sites due to the high bulk as well as electrochemically active surface area, mesoporous structure, and synergistic coupling between the optimum compositions of NiO and NiMoO4 within the sheet-like networks. Moreover, an aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled by employing NNMO-3 and activated carbon as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively, and exhibits a maximum specific capacity of 216.2 C g(-1) (144.1 F g(-1)), specific energy of 45.0 W h kg(-1) at a specific power of 750.0 W kg(-1), promising rate capability of 58.5%, and good cycling stability with 86.2% capacitive retention after 2500 charge-discharge cycles. Based on the overall performance, we can infer that the NNMO-3 nanocomposite may be a promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitor applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000756763000001	35174381

The protein binds approximately four chlorophyll a molecules, one chlorophyll b molecule and carotenoids. Its 77-K fluorescence-emission spectrum exhibits a maximum at 680 +/- 1 nm. The protein has a high tendency to form a dimer in the presence of Ca2+ . Ca2+ binding affects the low-temperature fluorescence-emission maximum, leading to a decrease in its intensity and a blue shift of 1 nm. Similar spectral changes were obtained in the presence of Mg2+, possibly indicating a common binding domain for both cations. We interpret these observations as cation-induced conformational changes of the protein, which were reversible upon subsequent incubation in EDTA. Evidence is presented for the involvement of carboxyl groups in the coordination sphere of the bivalent cations. The possible structural and functional role of the protein is discussed.									20	0	0	0	17	0	20			0014-2956			WOS:A1991GK20500024	1935948

In this paper, the relation between the photoelectrochemical performance and the variation of electrolyte composition is investigated in depth. Here, the potassium phosphate (KPi) containing different anions (CH3COO-, Cl- and NO2-) or cations (NH4+, K+ and Na+) was prepared at the electrolyte with the different pH values of 5, 7, 9, and 11 in order to investigate how anions or cations affect the PEC performance. Herein, we compared the differences in the undoped and Mo-doped BiVO4 films due to the different bulk/surface states, and found different morphological and crystalline features as well as remarkably different PEC performance. At first, the pH in the electrolyte significantly influences the solar water oxidation reaction, revealing that the electrolyte with a high pH grants better PEC activity, because the higher pH solution can provide more hydroxide ions (OH-) to react with holes to form hydroxyl radicals, which are recognized as important intermediates for PEC water oxidation in the presence of O-2. Further, in the electrolyte containing the different cations, the NH4+ ions exhibit the enhanced PEC performance, due to its cation size which increases the ionic dissociation and viscosity. By contrast, the anion effect can be negligible in the used electrolyte. From this fundamental research, it can be known that the optimization of electrolyte is quite a vital parameter for advancing the PEC performance.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000469907700006

The G-PdAg composite is prepared for the first time via a completely electrochemical, fast, green and one-step procedure leading to the formation of both dendritic and spherical graphene supported PdAg bimetallic catalysts on a commercially applicable CC electrode. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) are used for physical and elemental characterization of the modified electrodes. Electrochemical characterizations are performed using cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

Oxidation in dry air at 300 degrees C transforms this metallic Mn layer into a manganese(II)-rich MnOx coating (x = 1-1.3), which also contains a buried layer of an In-Sn alloy originating from reactions with the ITO support. The MnOx films are well connected to the underlying substrate and act as efficient catalysts for water-oxidation catalysis (WOC) at neutral pH. Detailed post-operando analyses using XRD, SEM, TEM and XAS revealed that the dense MnO/Mn3O4 film is virtually not affected by 2 h of electrochemical WOC at E approximate to +1.8 V vs. RHE, corresponding well to the observed good stability of catalytic currents, which is unusual for such thin layers of a MnOx catalyst. The current densities during electrolyses are so far low (i approximate to 50-100 mu A cm(-2) at pH 7), but optimization of the preparation process may allow for significant improvements. This new, rather easy, and adaptable preparation method for stable, thin-layer MnOx water-oxidation anodes could thus prove to be very useful for a variety of applications.									16	1	0	0	1	0	17			2398-4902			WOS:000422784900023

The photoelectrochemical results reveal that Ti-2 /TiO2 could improve the separation of the photo-induced carriers in Zn0.5Cd0.5S/Ti2C/TiO2 heterojunction. And OFT calculations demonstrate that the Gibbs free energy of oxygen-terminated Ti2C and TiO2 are much lower than that of Zn0.5Cd0.5S. Therefore, the Ti2C/TiO2 has an active impact on improving the H-2 production of Zn0.5Cd0.5S. This study provides a new way to explore the application of inexpensive co-catalysts on a large scale.

However, most extant works concerning the adsorption behaviors of GO at the L/L interface have been limited to the non-polarized L/L interface. Here, we studied what would happen if GO nanosheets met with a polarizable L/L interface, namely an interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (ITIES). On one hand, the adsorption behavior of GO nanosheets at the L/L interface was electrochemically investigated firstly by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and alternating current voltammetry (ACV). On the other hand, the influence of the adsorbed GO layers at the L/L interface on the ion transfer reactions was studied by employing ion-transfer voltammetry of TEA(+)and ClO(4)(-)selected as probe ions. Capacitance measurements show that the interfacial capacitance increases greatly in the presence of GO nanosheets inside the aqueous phase, which can be attributed to the increases of interfacial corrugation and charge density induced by the parallel adsorption and assembly of GO at the L/L interface. In addition, it is found that the application of an interfacial potential difference by external polarization can promote the adsorption of GO at the L/L interface. Moreover, the ion-transfer voltammetric results further demonstrate that the GO layers formed at the interface can suppress the ion transfer reactions due to interfacial blocking and charge screening, as well as the hindrance effect induced by the GO layers. All the results with insights into the interfacial behavior of GO under polarization with an external electric field enable understanding the adsorption behavior of GO at the L/L interface more comprehensively.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2046-2069		WOS:000552843400046	35518605

Although extensive studies have focused on the metal-oxide catalysts, the effect of metal coordination on the catalytic ability remains still elusive. Here we select four cobalt-based phosphate catalysts with various cobalt-and phosphate-group coordination as a platform to better understand the catalytic activity of cobalt-based materials. Although they exhibit various catalytic activities and stabilities during water oxidation, Na2CoP2O7 with distorted cobalt tetrahedral geometry shows high activity comparable to that of amorphous cobalt phosphate under neutral conditions, along with high structural stability. First-principles calculations suggest that the surface reorganization by the pyrophosphate ligand induces a highly distorted tetrahedral geometry, where water molecules can favourably bind, resulting in a low overpotential (similar to 0.42 eV). Our findings emphasize the importance of local cobalt coordination in the catalysis and suggest the possible effect of polyanions on the water oxidation chemistry.									279	4	2	0	21	0	284			2041-1723			WOS:000363017500024	26365091

Semi-transparent thin films of tungsten trioxide were fabricated by sol-gel process, incorporating a block co-polymer to induce a template-directed mesoporous structure. These thin films are deposited by dip coating onto transparent conducting oxide substrates and crystallized at a low temperature of 400 degrees C in air. These WO3 photoanodes exhibit a photocurrent of up to 0.6 mA cm(-2) in potassium phosphate buffers of pH 2, 4, and 6 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under 300 mW cm(-2) visible (400-900 nm) light irradiation with a faradaic efficiency of up to 75%. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that corrosion occurs in electrolytes of pH > 4. The faradaic efficiencies in varying pH solutions suggest that parasitic redox reactions occurs in acidic conditions, limiting the O-2 production and demonstrating the need for stable surface co-catalysts to increase faradaic efficiencies. In neutral conditions, protective layers and/or co-catalysts are needed for increasing WO3 photoanode stability.									54	2	0	0	2	0	53			2398-4902			WOS:000422769100015

The electrodes made from the novel nanoarchitecture exhibit multi-functional electrochemical performance. They deliver an excellent specific capacitance of 796 F g(-1) at a current density of 2 A g(-1) in a 2 M KOH aqueous solution and a long-term cyclic stability of 94.7% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. When applied to electro-catalytic oxidation of methanol, the current density of the CuCo2O4/Cu foam electrode in 1 M KOH mixed with 0.5 M methanol is maintained up to 27.6 A g(-1). The superior electrochemical performances are mainly due to the unique one dimensional porous acicular architecture with a very large surface area and porosity grown on a highly conductive Cu substrate, offering faster ion/electron transfer, an improved reactivity and an enhanced structural stability. The fabrication strategy presented here is simple, cost-effective and scalable, which can open new avenues for large-scale applications of the novel materials in energy storage.									153	3	0	0	8	0	155			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000353927500054

Going from single, tandem, triple up to quadruple junctions, we cover a range of open circuit voltages from 0.5 V to 2.8 V at photovoltaic cell (PV) efficiencies above 13%. The solar cells were combined with electrochemical (EC) cells in integrated devices from 0.5 cm(2) to 64 cm(2). Various combinations of catalyst pairs for the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction side (OER and HER) were investigated with respect to electrochemical activity, stability, cost and - important for the integrated device - optical quality of the metal catalyst on the HER side as back reflector of the attached solar cell. The combined PV-EC systems were further investigated under varied operation temperatures and illumination conditions for estimation of outdoor performance and annual fuel production yield. For 0.5 cm(2) size combined systems a maximum solar-to-hydrogen efficiency eta(STH) = 9.5% was achieved under standard test conditions. For device upscaling to 64 cm(2) various concepts of contact interconnects for reduced current and fill factor loss when using large size solar cells were investigated. To replace high performance noble metal based catalyst pairs (Pt/RuO2 or Pt/IrOx), more abundant and cheaper NiMo (HER) and NiFeOx (OER) compounds were prepared via electrodeposition. With the NiMo/NiFeOx catalyst pair we obtained eta(STH) = 5.1% for a 64 cm(2) size solar cell which was even better than the performance of the Pt/IrO2 system (eta(STH) = 4.8%). In simulated day-night cycle operation the NiMo/NiFeOx catalyst pair showed excellent stability over several days. The experimental studies were successfully accompanied by simulation of the entire PV-EC device using a series connection model which allowed studies and pre-estimations of device performance by varying individual components such as catalysts, electrolytes, or solar cells. Based on these results we discuss the prospects and challenges of integrated PV-EC devices on large area for hydrogen and solar fuel production in general.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0942-9352			WOS:000542554000002

However, LiO2 as an intermediate product in the discharge process is very active and could be readily disproportionated into Li2O2. Thus, it is challenging to find an appropriate cathode catalyst, which can stabilize the active discharge product LiO2. In this work, heteroatom N and Co codoped titanium dioxide nanoparticles grown on carbon fibers (N,Co-TiO2/CFs) are fabricated and employed as a non-noble metal cathode catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries. LiO2 formed in the Li-O-2 batteries can be repeatedly charged and discharged with a very low charge potential of approximately 3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+). N,Co-codoped TiO2 is proposed to be responsible for the generation of stable LiO2. This discovery opens a new way for the fabrication of non-noble metal cathode catalysts for high-performance LiO2-based Li-O-2 batteries.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000490983100024

The full-length cDNA of APX gene was 1357 bp, containing 107 bp 5'UTR (Untranslated region), 146 bp 3'UTR and a 1104 bp open reading frame (ORF) which encodes a polypeptide of 367 amino-acid residues with a molecular weight of 40.79 kD. BLAST (Basic Local Alignmen Search Tool) showed that most of homologous protein sequences of APX in H. sinensis belonged to the plant kingdom. Phylogenetic results by Maximum Likelihood (ML) method and Bayesian analyses revealed that homologous sequences of APX from plant and animal kingdom each formed a single cluster. The ORF of APX gene was subcloned into plasmid pET-GST and transferred into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The recombinant GST-APX fusion protein mainly expressed in the form of soluble were immunized New Zealand rabbits get the polyclonal antibody against APX for Western blotting assay (WB). H. sinensis was cultured (0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 hours per day with illumination intensity 2000 lx) for 30 days, which up-regulated APX expression under longer illumination time (more than 16 hours per day). Due to continuous photosynthetic activity, a large number of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulating in symbiotic green algae could spread to the host cell (hydra cell), and the upregulation of APX expression in H. sinensis may mediate the removal of intracellular ROS.			为探讨中国绿水螅(Hydra sinensis)抗坏血酸过氧化物酶(Ascorbate peroxidase, APX)基因的起源及功能,研究采用RACE方法克隆了中国绿水螅APX基因的全长cDNA序列。该cDNA序列总长1357 bp,包括5'非编码区107 bp, 3'非编码区146 bp及开放阅读框(Open reading frame, ORF) 1104 bp,共编码367个氨基酸,预测蛋白质分子量为40.79 kD。BLAST结果表明中国绿水螅APX蛋白同源序列绝大部分来自植物界;通过最大似然法(Maximum-likelihood)和贝叶斯分析(Bayesian inference)进行的系统发生分析显示植物界及动物界物种的APX序列各自形成单系群。把APX基因ORF全长序列克隆到原核表达质粒pET-GST中,重组质粒转化E. coli BL21(DE3)菌株, IPTG诱导后成功表达重组融合蛋白GST-APX,再使用纯化的重组蛋白免疫新西兰兔制备多克隆抗体用于APX蛋白的免疫印迹分析(Western blotting assay, WB)。在不同光照时长梯度(光强度2000 lx,每天分别光照0、4h、8h、12h、16h、20h及24h)下培养中国绿水螅30d,实时定量PCR(Quantitative real-time PCR, qPCR)及WB检测结果均表明光照时间较长时(每天光照12h以上)绿水螅APX表达呈现一定程度的上调。在长时间光辐射下水螅体内共生绿藻连续进行光合作用所累积的大量活性氧能够扩散到水螅细胞内,此时水螅体内表达上调的APX可能参与清除其细胞内的活性氧。						0	1	0	0	1	0	1			1000-3207			CSCD:6443464

Herein, uniform Ru nanoparticles (NPs) with various size distributions were synthesized as a non-Pt catalyst on a carbon support by fluidized bed reactor-atomic layer deposition (FBR-ALD) as a function of ALD cycles for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline medium. With an increase in the number of ALD cycles from 5 to 30 cycles, the wt% of the Ru NPs increased from similar to 5 to similar to 32 wt%. In addition, the structural characterization of the Ru NPs revealed the formation of Ru NPs with a uniform, dense, and controllable size (similar to 2-4 nm) and crystallinity depending on the growth cycle of ALD. However, the 10 cycled Ru catalyst with a NP size of similar to 2 nm possessed a highly electrochemically active roughened surface (amorphous moiety covered the crystallite), which enhanced its HOR and mass activity. Remarkably, the ALD-synthesized Ru catalyst outperformed a commercial Ru/C catalyst with a similar wt%. Hydrogen binding energy (HBE) calculations revealed that the specific activity of the catalyst increased with decreasing HBE. The mechanistic pathway for the HOR indeed illustrates that enhanced activity under alkaline conditions was found owing to the weakening of the metal-H interaction influenced by the Ru NP crystallinity and size. The findings of this study indicate that the FBR-ALD technique is an effective, scalable approach for the synthesis of active non-Pt metal catalysts.									6	1	0	0	1	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000670219500001

The composite electrode presented the highest specific capacitance of 2353 F g(-1) at a charge and discharge current density of 2.5 A g(-1) with excellent cycling ability, retaining 95% of the maximum capacitance after 3000 cycles. Even at a high current density of 50 A g(-1), the electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of up to 2173 F g(-1). In addition, the testing of a (Ni-Co oxides NWs@TiO2NTs)//(Ni-Co oxides NWs@TiO2NTs) symmetric cell yielded a specific capacitance of up to 144 F g(-1) at a current density of 4 A g(-1). The much improved capacity and cycling stability may be attributed to the superior conductivity and the aligned structure of the Ni-Co oxides NWs and the TiO2NTs substrate, which can improve electron/ion transport and enhance the kinetics of the redox reactions.									101	6	0	0	2	0	102			2050-7488			WOS:000314632100022

Herein, we report the synthesis of novel Ni-Co alloy@carbon microspheres by calcining Co/Ni bimetallic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) prepared by a facile solvothermal reaction. Their structures, dimensions and electrochemical performance can be optimized by simply tuning the Co/Ni molar ratio. Benefiting from the advantageous structural and compositional features, the obtained Ni-Co alloy@carbon microspheres display exceptional electrochemical performance when used as counter electrode (CE) catalysts for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In particular, the optimized NiCo0.2@C CE delivers an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.30%, showing a similar to 15.7% enhancement compared to that of Pt CE (8.04%). Additionally, the NiCo0.2@C CE also demonstrates a good long-term electrochemical stability for the I-3 (-)/I- electrolyte. This work may provide new options for the design and preparation of efficient electrocatalysts with novel morphologies and desirable compositions.									84	2	0	0	9	0	84			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000418533400041

Before deposition, the sample surfaces were treated with the following solutions: (A) H2O2: H2SO4 (piranha), (B) fluoride acid (HF) + HCl, and (C) piranha + HF for 10 min each. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that, independently from the surface preparation, all the films are adherent and uniform with thicknesses of about 27-28 nm. However, a different structural evolution has been observed under electron beam effect. In particular, while all the as-deposited films were found to be amorphous, the formation of polycrystalline grains was observed on the sample deposited after the A treatment. On the other hand, oriented layers were formed on the samples deposited after B and C treatments. This result is an indication that in the case of HF-based treatments, the PEALD occurred on a very clean AlGaN surface, which can act as seed layer for the formation of epitaxial films when some energy is provided. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed smoother Al2O3 films when grown after HF based treatments. Moreover, further AFM investigation of the initial growth stages (3 nm thick Al2O3 layers) demonstrated that the smallest three-dimensional grain nucleation resulted in deposition on C-treated surfaces. Finally, the predeposition treatments of AlGaN/GaN surfaces with the HF cleaning provided Al2O3 films having the most promising dielectric properties.

This native PS II core complex contained, in addition to the proteins that have been well characterized in the core complex previously purified by LDAO and Triton X-100, two more extrinsic proteins with apparent molecular weights of 17 and 12 kDa. These two proteins were associated with the core complex in stoichiometric amounts and could be released by treatment with 1 M CaCl2 or 1 M alkaline Tris but not by 2 M NaCl or low-glycerol treatment, indicating that they are the real components of PS II of this cyanobacterium. N-Terminal sequencing revealed that the 17 and 12 kDa proteins correspond to the apoprotein of cytochrome c550, a low potential c-type cytochrome, and the 9 kDa extrinsic protein previously found in a partially purified PS II preparation from Phormidium laminosum, respectively. In spite of retention of these two extrinsic proteins, no homologues of higher plant 23 and 17 kDa extrinsic proteins could be detected in this cyanobacterial PS II core complex.									121	2	0	0	111	0	125			0014-5793			WOS:A1992HP89600005	1314738

Penta two-dimensional (2D) materials owning to the versatile properties received much attention recently. In this work, we defined two new 2D penta structures, namely MSe2 (M = Cd, Zn), and evaluated their potentials as the photocatalysts by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We found that both structures are mechanically, kinetically and thermally stable according to their elastic constant calculations, vibrational phonon calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, respectively. CdSe2 and ZnSe2 sheets are semiconductors with band gaps of 2.13 and 2.26 eV, respectively, obtained on the basis of Herd-Scuseria-Ernzerh (HSE06) functional. Their optical absorptions cover the range from the visible light region to the near-ultraviolet region. Interestingly, the band edge positions of MSe2 (M = Cd, Zn) sheets can perfectly engulf the redox potentials of the water-splitting reaction. Besides, we found that, by applying suitable strain, their band gaps and optical absorptions can be notablely improved while their suitable band edge alignments for the water splitting are still maintained. This work discloses two new 2D penta structures which are expectable to be the promising photocatalysts for water splitting.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0042-207X			WOS:000582757100048		
J	Jiao, Danhua; Xie, Zhengwei; Wan, Qi; Qu, Meizhen								Reduced irreversible capacities of graphene oxide-based anodes used for lithium ion batteries via alkali treatment								JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY				37				73	81		10.1016/j.jechem.2018.11.018				OCT 2019	2019	The large irreversible capacities of graphene oxide-based anodes hinder commercial applications of GO materials although the high specific capacity of it has been universally accepted. In this paper, GO was treated under alkaline condition and the composite consisting of the modified GO and graphite was used as anode for lithium ion batteries (LIBs), resulting in an improved initial coulombic efficiency. Electrochemical tests also showed that the modified GO/graphite electrode possessed 86.0% of initial coulombic efficiency, which was 15% higher than that of pristine GO/graphite electrode. The species and the content of functional groups were investigated via XPS, FTIR characterizations in detail, which certified that the ring-opening reaction of epoxides under alkaline condition could greatly reduce the irreversible capacity of GO/graphite anode, in addition, the reversible capacity was guaranteed at the same time. This modified GO/graphite electrodes in the LIBs exhibit superior rate capability and long cycle life. The uniqueness of this electrode lied in its chemical stability, which benefits from the transition of epoxide group and unstable functional groups removal.

In this paper, graphite carbon nitride was protonated by phosphoric acid (H3PO4), and a new few-layer porous carbon nitride was prepared by intercalation polymerization with doping bimetal in the cavity of g-C3N4. Under visible light irradiation, the CO formation rate of Co/Ni co-doped g-C3N4 can reach 13.55 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), which was 3.9 times higher than that of g-C3N4 (3.49 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)). The density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the addition of Co and Ni in the cavity of g-C3N4 can induce bimetallic synergistic regulation of the electronic structure, thus improving the separation efficiency of charges and visible light capture ability of g-C3N4. Our work has great reference value for designing and synthesizing novel bimetallic co-doped g-C3N4 photocatalytic materials.

Whilst the operating voltage window is governed by decom-position of water (i.e. 1.23 V), this can be overcome by levelling potentials of oxygen (OER) and hydrogen (HER) evolution reactions. Here we report the design of a symmetrical supercapacitor (SC) in which the electrodes are fabricated from an ink containing reduced graphene oxide (rGO) aerogel, carbon nano-tubes and binder by screen printing method on a conductive carbon cloth. For rGO aerogels, porous graphene oxide is prepared by freeze drying and reduced at 180 degrees C in vacuum. The solid-state super-capacitor is manufactured with two electrodes and a cation exchange electrolyte membrane and can operate stably at 1.6 V in a neutral environment. The initial supercapacitor power density increases from 61.7 to 602 W kg(-1) when the current is raised from 0.1 to 1 A g(-1). During the long-term durability test, the SC energy density decreases from 4.2 to 2.7 Wh kg(-1) while the power density reduces from 61.7 to 53.1 W kg(-1). The post-mortem analysis performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy on electrodes demonstrats only small chemical modifications of positive electrode, while negative electrode is insig-nificantly altered, indicating promising perspectives for the usability of rGO-aerogel-based electrodes in practical supercapacitor applications. The self-discharge of the supercapacitor assessed after 10 000 charge/discharge cycles and 140 h floating at 1.6 V is mainly dependent on the activation contributions, likely due to Faradaic processes, which are more significant than that of diffusional ion species and voltage decay due to ohmic leakage mechanism. The solid-state rGO-based supercapacitor is found to be rather stable even under very stringent durability test, revealing low self-discharge rate that can promote possible commercial applications.

J	Lian, Zheng; Lu, Youcai; Ma, Shiyu; Li, Zhongjun; Liu, Qingchao								Metal atom-doped Co3O4 nanosheets for Li-O-2 battery catalyst: Study on the difference of catalytic activity								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				445						136852	10.1016/j.cej.2022.136852				OCT 1 2022	2022	As a new star in catalysts, single atom catalysts (SACs) show excellent catalytic activity for Li-O2 battery. However, the mechanism of SACs in Li-O2 battery remains a vague but crucial challenge. Hence, we synthesized a series of Co3O4 nanosheet array-supported single atom catalysts grown on carbon cloth (marked as MSACo3O4/CC, M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn), whose (MSA-Co3O4/CC) structural and physicochemical properties are similar, and used them as cathode catalysts for Li-O2 batteries. Experimental results show that the catalytic activity of MSA-Co3O4/CC doped with different metal atoms is different for Li-O2 battery. Compared with the original Co3O4/CC cathode, the catalytic activity of some MSA-Co3O4/CC is improved while that of others is decreased. Among them, NiSA-Co3O4/CC has the best catalytic activity for Li-O2 battery, while VSA-Co3O4/CC has the worst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation revealed that the reaction barrier on the active sites and the interaction (adsorption energy and electron transfer) between the doped metal atoms and the key reactants are the main factors affecting the catalytic activity of different metal atoms doped MSA-Co3O4/CC. We believe that this universal preparation method is of great significance for the development of novel SACs. In addition, this work also provides an atomic-scale understanding of fundamental catalytic trends and mechanisms for studying SACs.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000801861100005		
J	Hou, Lianhua; Ma, Weijiao; Luo, Xia; Tao, Shizhen; Guan, Ping; Liu, Jinzhong								Chemical structure changes of lacustrine Type-II kerogen under semi-open pyrolysis as investigated by solid-state C-13 NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy								MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY				116						104348	10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2020.104348				JUN 2020	2020	At present, there is a lack of research on the structural changes of lacustrine Type-II kerogen, which is regionally distributed but has significant potential for hydrocarbon resources. In our previous work, a series of non-hydrous, temperature-based semi-open pyrolysis experiments have been performed on the Chang 7 oil shale to simulate the thermal maturation (from 0.53 %Ro to 1.68 %Ro) of lacustrine Type-II kerogen. In that work, the parallel reaction pathway for kerogen decomposition was supported. The aim of this work is to reveal the structural changes of the post-pyrolysis kerogen. Integrated analysis including elemental analysis, programmed pyrolysis (Rock-Eval), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13 NMR) spectroscopy were conducted on the native unheated and post-pyrolysis rocks and kerogens. Based on the compositional features of the hydrocarbon products, structural changes of the post-pyrolysis kerogen were investigated, and insights on the initial chemical structure of the kerogen were also obtained. Before the peak hydrocarbon-generating stage (R-o < 0.6%), defunctionalization of oxygen-containing functional groups, which leads to the generation of water, CO2 and NSOs, occurs simultaneously with the detachment of short aliphatic side chains and small aromatic rings, which leads to the generation of volatile fractions (C-6 -C-14 , C-15(+) sat and C15(+) aro). This process suggests that the Chang7 kerogen is highly branched. During the peak hydrocarbon-generating stage (0.6-1.09 %R-o), the concurrent breakage of weak cross-link bonds and long aliphatic chains lead to the simultaneous peak generation of liquid hydrocarbons and NSOs. This reflects the highly cross-linked features of the Chang7 kerogen. After the peak hydrocarbon-generating stage (R-o > 1.09%), the reactions in the previous two stages produce a highly aromatic kerogen. The increased aromaticity of the highly matured kerogen is most likely to be caused by aromatization or dehydrogenation of hydroaromatics and coking of aromatic bitumen, not by fusing or condensation of aromatic rings.									39	4	0	0	1	0	40			0264-8172	1873-4073		WOS:000528600100007

The design of active sites with composite oxides provides a new approach for developing high-performance catalysts. In this study, an Fe-doped Ni/NiO nanocomposite film was constructed on an ionic liquid/water interface to promote hydrogen generation. The optimized Ni/FeNiOx-25 catalyst showed excellent catalytic activity toward ammonia borane hydrolysis, with a turnover frequency of 72.3 min(-1). The enhancing effect of Fe2+ doping on Ni/NiO films was confirmed by the improved intrinsic activity and theoretical simulations. Fe ion doping stabilized NiO and prevented NiO from becoming Ni. The interfacial Ni-Fe2+ dual active sites on the FeNiOx and Ni interfaces participated in the targeted adsorption and effective activation of water and NH3BH3 molecules, respectively. The sufficiently exposed plane surface of the nanofilms provided abundant active sites for catalytic reactions. This significant advance will inspire development in the ambient liquid hydrogen storage field.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000697282300054	34472335	
J	Zhao, Lei; Guo, Zhengang; Liu, Zhifeng								Facile synthesis and efficient electrochemical water splitting of bifunctional nanostructured Ni-based layered double hydroxide/sulfide composite								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				910						164880	10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.164880				JUL 25 2022	2022	The development of efficient, stable and low-cost bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting is of great practical significance for the industrial application of hydrogen production. In this paper, a well-aligned columnar nickel sulfide and NiAl layered double hydroxides composite (NiAl-LDH/Ni3S2) supported on Nifoam substrate was successfully designed and prepared by successive hydrothermal processes. Ni3S2 nanorod arrays attached to Ni-foam could provide large open space and short ions diffusion path, and NiAlLDH provides large contact area with electrolyte, thus enabling fast and reversible redox process, which together could promote electrocatalytic activity. Accordingly, the NiAl-LDH/Ni3S2/NF electrode shows excellent HER and OER performance, in which the low overpotentials of 53.6, 90.2 and 209.2 mV are needed to drive the current density of 10, 20 and 100 mA/cm(2) for HER, and similarly for OER, it needs 350.4 mV low overvoltage to reach 100 mA/cm2. In the self-assembled device, the overall water splitting reaction can be driven at a cell voltage of 1.56 V when NiAl-LDH/Ni3S2/NF electrode used as cathode and anode, to achieve the current density of 10 mA/cm(2), and the loss voltage is only 16.5 mV within 10 h, showing the excellent stability. The well-constructed NiAl-LDH/Ni3S2/NF is a promising material in the area of electrocatalytic water splitting, which is of practical significance to realize the industrial development of hydrogen production.

Herein, a facile one-pot solvothermal approach was developed to construct bimetallic platinum-rhodium alloyed nano-multipods (PtRh ANMPs) in oleylamine (OAm) by adopting creatinine and cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) as the co-structure-directing agents. The as-fabricated nanocatalyst exhibited extraordinary catalytic behaviors towards 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) and rhodamine B (RhB) reduction by sodium borohydride (NaBH4). Impressively, the resultant catalyst showed highly facilitated rate constant (k: 0.209/0.354 min(-1)) and turnover frequency (TOF: 1.0 x 10(-3)/0.44 x 10(-3) mol g-1 min(-1)) towards 4-NP and RhB reduction in comparison with commercial Pt black under the same conditions. This research offers some valuable insights for facile preparation of advanced nanostructures as efficient and recyclable catalyst in environmental remediation field. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

In accordance with density function theory calculations, the formation of (112) facets enriched apexes is proposed. Such intrinsically electron-enriched (112) facets at the apexes produce a potential facilitating the diffusion of photoexcited holes, which not only mitigates the recombination with the photoexcited electrons, but also provide an active reaction site for the photoassisted selective growth of cobalt phosphate (CoPi), a well known and highly active co-catalyst for water oxidation at the apex of BiVO4 nanopyramids. Benefiting from the element-resolved properties of synchrotron-based X-ray spectroscopy, 3d electrons on the vanadium site are directly resolved by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering measurements. Due to this unique morphology, the charge at the apex is expected to induce a strong interaction with CoPi, as a result of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer spectroscopy feature observed from the cobalt site. Substantial evidences are collected by means of comprehensive soft X-ray spectroscopy techniques with high spectral resolution revealing the atomic-scale origin and the nature of the synergy as well as the strong correlation between its unique structural properties and the electronic structure of this novel highly-ordered hybrid photocatalyst and its significantly improved photo-electrochemical performance.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000448994600054

The optimization of the Sn and NiOx electrodeposition loadings on Fe2O3 produced a maximum photocurrent density of 1.35 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V (vs. RHE), with the highest shift on the reaction onset potential, representing a large improvement in relation to bare hematite. Long-term photoelectrolysis studies of the Fe2O3/Sn-10/NiOx at 1.23 V showed that the photocurrent density remained stable for at least 24 h. The assessment of the results from the calculations of charge separation (eta(sep)) and charge injection (eta(cat)) efficiencies revealed an improvement in both parameters, with the addition of tin into hematite. This was ascribed to its beneficial effect on lowering the charge recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers on grain-boundaries and on the hematite/electrolyte interface. Additionally, it was evidenced that NiOx was more important on the increase in the charge injection, since it is a hole collector, acting as co-catalyst, which improves charge transfer rate at the interface with the electrolyte. The outcome of the Mott-Schottky analysis displayed a negative shift of the flat band potentials (E-fb) for both, Sn- and NiOx-modified photo-electrocatalysts, due to the passivation of the surface states, and this was in agreement with the mathematical fitting of the curves obtained via photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS) measurements. The present findings clearly showed that, by allowing a fine-tuning of the amount of the metal modifiers and with an efficient deposition at functional sites of the hematite, this electrodeposition method is a promising strategy to boost hematite performance as photo-electrocatalyst.

J	Sato, Yoshihiro; Sicotte, Danielle					, Yoshi/0000-0003-2532-6720			Asymmetry in Charge Transfer Pathways Caused by Pigment-Protein Interactions in the Photosystem II Reaction Center Complex								CATALYSTS				10	6					718	10.3390/catal10060718				JUN 2020	2020	This article discusses the photoinduced charge transfer (CT) kinetics within the reaction center complex of photosystem II (PSII RC). The PSII RC exhibits a structural symmetry in its arrangement of pigments forming two prominent branches, D1 and D2. Despite this symmetry, the CT has been observed to occur exclusively in the D1 branch. The mechanism to realize such functional asymmetry is yet to be understood. To approach this matter, we applied the theoretical tight-binding model of pigment excitations and simulated CT dynamics based upon the framework of an open quantum system. This simulation used a recently developed method of computation based on the quasi-adiabatic propagator path integral. A quantum CT state is found to be dynamically active when its site energy is resonant with the exciton energies of the PSII RC, regardless of the excitonic landscape we utilized. Through our investigation, it was found that the relative displacement between the local molecular energy levels of pigments can play a crucial role in realizing this resonance and therefore greatly affects the CT asymmetry in the PSII RC. Using this mechanism phenomenologically, we demonstrate that a near 100-to-1 ratio of reduction between the pheophytins in the D1 and D2 branches can be realized at both 77 K and 300 K. Our results indicate that the chlorophyllChlD1is the most active precursor of the primary charge separation in the D1 branch and that the reduction of the pheophytins can occur within pico-seconds. Additionally, a broad resonance of the active CT state implies that a large static disorder observed in the CT state originates in the fluctuations of the relative displacements between the local molecular energy levels of the pigments in the PSII RC.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000552488000001

It was found that the dark reduction of P (870) (+) from Rb. sphaeroides R-26 is considerably accelerated upon the combined addition of 0.5 mM MnCl2 and 30-75 mM NaHCO3 (as a result of formation of "low-potential" complexes [Mn(HCO3)(2)]), while MnCl2 and NaHCO3 added separately had no such effect. The effect is not observed either in RC from Cf. aurantiacus (probably due to the low oxidation potential of the primary electron donor, P-865, which results in thermodynamic difficulties of the redox interaction between P (865) (+) and Mn2+) or in RC from Ch. minutissimum (apparently due to the presence of the RC-bound cytochrome preventing the direct interaction between P (870) (+) and Mn2+). The absence of acceleration of the dark reduction of P (870) (+) in the RC of Rb. sphaeroides R-26 when Mn2+ and HCO (3) (-) were replaced by Mg2+ or Ca2+ and by formate, oxalate, or acetate, respectively, reveals the specificity of the Mn2+-bicarbonate complexes for the redox interaction with P+. The results of this work might be considered as experimental evidence for the hypothesis of the participation of Mn2+ complexes in the evolutionary origin of the inorganic core of the water oxidizing complex of photosystem II.									6	0	1	0	6	0	8			0006-2979	1608-3040		WOS:000298332900009	22150281

Five distinct types of deposits have been recognized. The most significant mineralizing events were related to the two major phases of deformation (H-D1, H-D2) and granite emplacement during the Hercynian orogeny. Stable isotope and lithogeochemical data demonstrate that the metals, as well as sulfur and carbon, were sourced from the local sedimentary rocks.Type A deposits are minor occurrences of strata-bound mineralization with Zn > Pb, occurring as disseminations and small veins in Late Ordovician limestone. A syndiagenetic origin is suggested by the limited stratigraphic distribution of the mineralization and anomalous base metal contents of Late Ordovician-Early Silurian black shales overlying the mineralized limestone. Minor remobilization of disseminated sulfides into joints took place during late diagenesis or early Hercynian deformation.Types B, C, and D are syntectonic deposits with Zn > Pb. Type B deposits are strongly deformed veins in H-D1 fractures in Ordovician rocks. A process involving local mobilization of metals by a surface-derived fluid is indicated by depleted metal contents of host rocks adjacent to the veins, the similarity of delta(34)S values of ore sulfides with disseminated pyrite in the host rocks, and the delta18O(H2O) values. Type C deposits exhibit a greater variation in morphology and degree of deformation compared to other types and are found in both H-D1 and H-D2 fractures in Late Ordovician and Silurian rocks. The stratigraphic distribution and delta(34)S values of sulfides are similar to type A deposits, suggesting that localized hydrothermal systems either remobilized type A mineralization or derived metals and sulfur from the same source. Type D deposits occur in H-D2 shear fractures in Neoproterozoic rocks. The delta(13)C values of carbonate gangue and the similarity of delta(34)S values of ore sulfides and disseminated pyrite in the host rocks indicate that black shales of the Neoproterozoic sequence are the major source of sulfur and carbon. Mixing of a metamorphic fluid with a surface-derived fluid is suggested by fluid inclusion and oxygen isotope data.Type E deposits, the most abundant and economically most important type, are post-tectonic Ph > Zn veins occupying H-D2 fractures and are widely distributed through the district in rocks ranging from Neoproterozoic to Late Ordovician. Mineral assemblages and Ag contents of the veins show a zonal relationship with respect to monzogranite outcrops, indicating that late Hercynian magmatism was the source of heat driving fluid migration through the fracture system. Fluid inclusion and oxygen isotope data are typical of basinal. brines. Reaction of the fluid with black shales of the Neoproterozoic sequence is suggested by delta(34)S values of sulfides and delta(13)C values of carbonates of the main stages of the paragenetic sequence. The final paragenetic stage consists of barite, calcite, and pyrite, which may have been deposited during a later hydrothermal event, probably in the Early Triassic.									11	0	0	0	4	0	11			0361-0128			WOS:000183056000006

Although the concept of the GOE is widely accepted, the NOE is less well constrained and its timing and extent remain the subjects of debate. We review available evidence for the NOE against the background of major climatic perturbations, tectonic upheaval related to the break-up of the supercontinent Rodinia and reassembly into Gondwana, and, most importantly, major biological innovations exemplified by the Ediacarian Biota and the Cambrian 'Explosion'.Geochemical lines of evidence for the NOE include perturbations to the biogeochemical cycling of carbon. Generally high delta C-13 values are possibly indicative of increased organic carbon burial and the release of oxidative power to the Earth's surface environment after c. 800 Ma. A demonstrably global and primary record of extremely negative delta C-13 values after about 580 Ma strongly suggests the oxidation of a large dissolved organic carbon pool (DOC), the culmination of which around c. 550 Ma coincided with an abrupt diversification of Ediacaran macrobiota. Increasing Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios toward the Neoproterozoic-Cambrian transition indicates enhanced continental weathering which may have fuelled higher organic production and burial during the later Neoproterozoic.Evidence for enhanced oxidative recycling is given by the increase in sulfur isotope fractionation between sulfide and sulfate, exceeding the range usually attained by sulfate reduction alone, reflecting an increasing importance of the oxidative part in the sulfur cycle. S/C ratios attained a maximum during the Precambrian-Cambrian transition, further indicating higher sulfate concentrations in the ocean and a transition from dominantly pyrite burial to sulfate burial after the Neoproterozoic. Strong evidence for the oxygenation of the deep marine environment has emerged through elemental approaches over the past few years which were able to show significant increases in redox-sensitive trace-metal (notably Mo) enrichment in marine sediments not only during the GOE but even more pronounced during the inferred NOE. In addition to past studies involving Mo enrichment, which has been extended and further substantiated in the current review, we present new compilations of V and U concentrations in black shales throughout Earth history that confirm such a rise and further support the NOE. With regard to ocean ventilation, we also review other sedimentary redox indicators, such as iron speciation, molybdenum isotopes and the more ambiguous REE patterns. Although the timing and extent of the NOE remain the subjects of debate and speculation, we consider the record of redox-sensitive trace-metals and C and S contents in black shales to indicate delayed ocean ventilation later in the Cambrian on a global scale with regard to rising oxygen levels in the atmosphere which likely rose during the Late Neoproterozoic.

Carboxylate-based MOFs, such as MIL-53 structures, attract a lot of attention among MOF families because of their remarkable stability in water and even alkaline condition. Hence, the delicate hierarchical microstructure is constructed by introducing MoO42- into NH2-MIL-53(NiFe) using a straightforward solvothermal strategy. The NiFeMo-MOF/NF electrode manifests a superior OER performance, producing an overpotential of 239 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) and a decent Tafel slope of 87.0 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, in a typical electrodeposition equipment, NiFeMo-MOF/NF is applied as the working electrode and the composite electrode named as (M) Ni-NiOOH/NF is generated by electrodeposition and electrooxidation process to assess HER performance, producing an overpotential of 119 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) and a decent Tafel slope of 58.3 mV dec(-1). The integrated electrolysis device delivers an extraordinarily low cell voltage of 1.50 V at 10 mA cm(-2) while applying NiFeMo-MOF/NF as the anode, (M)Ni-NiOOH/NF as the cathode for overall water splitting, exceeding the noble RuO2/NF parallel to Pt-C/NF (1.60 V@10 mA cm(-2)). This study provides a promising design strategy for future electrolysis catalysts. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

It can be found that the pyrolysis process of RS and HDPE blends was characterized by two stages. The first stage primarily consisted of the decomposition of RS. The second stage was dominant by the degradation of HDPE. The interactions between RS and HDPE were obvious in the temperature range of 435-520 degrees C. The existence of HDPE delayed the decomposition of RS in the first step, while in the second step, the existence of RS delayed the degradation of HDPE. The primary gaseous products for the blends arose from the overlap of the decomposition products from the individual RS and HDPE. However, no new substance can be observed in the blends compared to the decomposition of individual RS and HDPE. The primary gaseous products were Hy, H2O, CO2, CO, aldehydes (C2H4O), alcohols (C2H5OH), carboxyls (CH3COOH) and hydrocarbons (CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, C3H8). The addition of HDPE in the blends could decrease the amount of the oxygen-containing compounds, and improve the yield of Hy and hydrocarbons. The effects of the interaction between RS and HDPE on the evolving of volatile species were affected by the percentage of RS in the blends. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Simulation of the OECD/NEA Sandia Fuel Project Phases I & II ignition tests with DRACCAR								NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN				330				524	537		10.1016/j.nucengdes.2018.01.047				APR 15 2018	2018	This paper describes simulations of two ignition tests performed at full power in the frame of the Sandia Fuel Project (SFP) with the thermo-mechanical code DRACCAR v2.3.The OECD/NEA Sandia Fuel Project was built on an agreement between 12 countries from OECD, the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) and the US-NRC for the characterization of thermal-hydraulic and zirconium fire phenomena in pressurized-water reactor (PWR). The experimental program was split in two phases to focus at first on axial heating and burn propagation in one prototypic fuel assembly (Phase I), and then on axial and radial heating and burn propagation in 1x4 fuel assemblies (Phase II).DRACCAR is a simulation tool, developed at IRSN, for fuel assembly mechanical behavior and coolability assessment during a LOCA transient. The flexibility of DRACCAR allows the modeling of many kinds of geometries. Because the code is based on a 3D non-structured meshing, it can be used to model any non-axisymmetric geometry, like the 1x4 fuel assemblies geometry of the Phase II of the SFP program.In order to check the consistency of the modeling, we have optimized the code options to get best results for the Phase I, and applied the same options to the Phase II. Most of the DRACCAR results have been successfully checked against experimental ones, using additional code improvements. Air oxidation and breakaway modeling of the zircaloy claddings were successfully tested against the experimental results. Nevertheless parts of the experimental results of Phase II have been difficult to reproduce. As many causes could be involved in these difficulties, such as detailed evolution of the air convective loop, radiative heat transfers in the bundles, and the modeling of additional reactions of zirconium with nitrogen in places where oxygen is lacking, there is still room for improvement in the work of interpretation and modeling of the SFP tests.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0029-5493	1872-759X		WOS:000428300200048

The efficiency of using this technology was assessed by: (i) the study of water permeability and rejection of some chemical parameters, such as total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), feacal coliforms, nitrates, chlorides, iron and manganese; and (ii) the evaluation of their ecotoxicological effects, through the use of representative species of different taxonomic and functional groups (Vibrio fischeri, Thamnocephalus platyurus, Daphnia magna, and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata). Results indicated that all three membranes have high rejection percentages for the majority of the studied parameters (>90%). All parameters concentrations in the permeate stream were below the limit values from Portuguese legislation and European Directives. With respect to the ecotoxicological effects, in general, the use of membranes removed the toxicity detected in the initial samples (which exhibited significant toxicity). The SW30 membrane showed a greater efficiency for toxicity removal, comparing with the nanofiltration membranes. Further, among the nanofiltration membranes used, the NF90 promoted a greater decrease in the toxicity of the samples. Thus, treatment with the membranes NF90 and SW30 allowed obtaining waters with high quality and low ecotoxicological potential, without risks for human populations and endangering the environmental balance.

The formation of the WO3/rGO composite was confirmed by XPS and Raman analyses. XPS analysis of the WO3/rGO composite revealed the presence of tungsten, carbon, and oxygen. Raman spectroscopy confirmed the presence of G and D bands in the WO3/rGO composite. The randomly arranged, interconnected, nanoplate-like morphology of WO3 was destroyed owing to the presence of rGO nanosheets and converted into a highly porous nanostructure. Multifunctional WO3 and WO3/rGO photocatalysts were used to study the sonocatalytic degradation of hazardous Congo red (CR) azo dye and photocatalytic hydrogen production. The surface area of the WO3/rGO composite (62.03 m(2)/g) was larger than that of WO3 (44.79 m(2)/g), thereby enhancing the efficiency of the sonocatalytic degradation and photocatalytic hydrogen production, which corresponds to the effective intercharge transfer between WO3 and rGO. Platinum was used as a co-catalyst with WO3/rGO to promote hydrogen production. The incorporation of rGO enhanced the CR dye degradation efficiency from 56 to 94% and the hydrogen production activity from 424.5 to 825.8 mu mol/h.g.									34	0	0	0	3	0	34			2468-0230			WOS:000663428700001

However, little is known about how doping affects the catalytic activity during surface catalysis. Herein, we took BiVO4 as an example to investigate the effect of doping on surface catalysis from both experimental and theoretical perspectives. To enable an impartial comparison, we have prepared planar BiVO4 thin films with and without W doping. It was found that W doping had no obvious effect on the morphology, crystallinity, and light absorption of the film; however, the photocurrent was significantly enhanced upon W doping. This enhancement is contributed by two important factors: better charge separation efficiency and improved surface charge transfer efficiency. Electrochemical analysis reveals that W doping lowers the surface charge transfer resistance and forms active surface states, facilitating charge transfer. Theoretical analysis shows that W doping activates the V atoms to be reactive sites. Moreover, the adsorption energies and distance between adsorption species (OHads, O-ads, and OOHads) involved in the water splitting process become more favorable for surface charge transfer. The current study provides an insight into the roles of W doping in BiVO4, especially during surface catalysis.									29	2	0	0	2	0	31			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000432601300057	29737988

Physiological mechanisms of thermotolerance may be important as they can influence both local and regional patterns of distribution and abundance. An established measure of thermotolerance is the heat shock response where heat shock proteins (Hsps) are produced in response to high temperature and protect cellular proteins from misfolding and degradation. It is hypothesized that Hsp production varies with developmental stage in many species, and U. pinnatifida, gametophytes have been shown to have a broader temperature range for growth and survival than sporophytes. Thus, we examined up-regulation of the hsp70 gene in gametophytes of invasive U. pinnatifida and compared it to values previously measured for sporophytes. Fertile sporophytes were collected from harbors in Monterey, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, and San Diego, California, and gametophytes were cultured from them in the laboratory. After being grown in controlled light and temperature conditions, gametophyte tissue was exposed to a temperature gradient and quantitative real-time PCR was used to determine relative amounts of hsp70 transcript. Expression of hsp70 was extremely low in gametophytes. An investigation of gametophyte thermal ecophysiology using oxygen evolution measures and pulse-amplitude-modulated (PAM) fluorometry at a subset of temperatures revealed that U. pinnatifida gametophytes decrease dark-adapted yield with increasing temperature from 17 to 31 degrees C. Photosynthetic rates declined but remained positive at all incubation temperatures, while respiration increased with increasing temperatures up to 26 degrees C and then declined. Thus, U. pinnatifida gametophytes remained metabolically active at temperatures well above normal environmental conditions, indicating they are broadly thermotolerant. This tolerance, however, likely is conferred by mechanisms other than upregulation of the hsp70 gene as no significant increases in expression related to temperature were observed in this study.

This work explores a novel processing route for the WC-Co system that has been conceptually proven for the Cr3C2-NiCr system. The tendency for carbides to dissolve in-flight is maximised in this approach, with subsequent heat treatment used to precipitate submicron carbide particles. Part 1 of this two-part series assessed the theoretical feasibility of applying this concept to the Co-W-C system for WC-17wt%Co composites, and characterised high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF), plasma Ar-He and plasma Ar-H2 coatings. In this follow-up paper, the powder and coating samples were characterised by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), followed by heat treatments below and above the identified phase transition temperatures. Compositional and microstructural analysis led to identification of the reactions accounting for each of the DSC peaks. These observations were contrasted with theoretical predictions as a function of the extent of carbide dissolution/decomposition and carbon loss in the as-sprayed coatings.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0263-4368	2213-3917		WOS:000634651400005

Gold mineralization in the Mina Velha (upper level) and Mandiocal (intermediate and lower levels) orebodies is hosted in highly strained Paleoproterozoic (2148-2160 Ma) felsic to intermediate metavolcanic rocks and schists that record greenschist facies metamorphism. The orebodies are broadly concordant with the regional northwest-oriented foliation, and mineralization comprises thick quartz vein sets and small quartz-carbonate-sulfide veinlets and enclosing hydrothermally altered host rocks. The hydrothermal mineral assemblage is postpeak metamorphism, syn- to late tectonic, and includes quartz, calcite, chlorite, white mica, pyrite, subordinate chalcopyrite, and traces of sphalerite and galena.Free-milling gold occurs in sulfide-poor veins in the upper and lower zones of the deposit, whereas refractory gold was deposited in fractures of pyrite and quartz in the more gold-enriched intermediate (+/- lower) level. Fluid inclusion and stable isotope (O, H, C, and S) data indicate that the two styles of gold deposition were produced by a combination of fluid immiscibility, fluid-rock reactions (sulfidation, carbonatization), and probably mixing, occurring in two discrete stages within a single mineralizing event associated with fluid flow within and around an active shear zone tinder fluctuating pressure conditions.The refractory gold was deposited at 340 degrees to 370 degrees C from a CO2-CH4-H2O-NaCl fluid having salinity of 5.8 +/- 2.7 wt percent NaCl equiv, variable CO2 contents (typically 12-22 mol %), and up to 6 mol percent CH4. The delta O-18 and delta D values of this fluid are 7.9 to 9.4 per mil and -29 to -37 per mil, respectively, indicating a metamorphic origin. Carbon isotopes show contrasting values in fluid inclusion CO2 (delta C-13 = -24.1%) and calcite (delta C-13 = of -3.8 parts per thousand). The strongly negative value of fluid inclusion CO2 is interpreted to be an organic signature acquired at the site of deposition by reaction of the deeply sourced ore-forming fluid with carbonaceous schists present in the deepest part of the deposit, The higher value for calcite probably records a crustal source. Oxygen fugacities calculated for the whole range of T-P-XCO2 conditions yielded log fo(2) between -28.7 and -30.5, indicating reduced conditions for the fluid, which is in agreement with the mineral paragenesis, fluid inclusion compositions, and sulfur isotope values.The second fluid, responsible for the deposition of the free-milling gold in veins and probably part of the gold of the lower zone of the deposit, had a lower temperature (330 degrees-340 degrees C). This CO2-H2O-NaCl fluid had a salinity of 1.6 to 2.5 wt percent NaCl equiv and contained 11 to 13 mol percent CO2. The delta O-18 and 61) values of this fluid are 5.3 to 7.2 per mil and -12 to -30 per mil, respectively, also indicating a metamorphic source. The delta C-13 value of fluid inclusion CO2 is -6.9 per mil, likely representing a mantle-derived carbon source. Log A values between -30.5 and -31.5 also indicate slightly more reduced conditions for this fluid. Both fluids had near-neutral pH, between 5 and 6.2, and delta S-34 values of H2S between -0.2 and -1.0 per mil, interpreted to reflect derivation of sulfur from magmatic sulfides.									24	1	1	0	0	0	26			0361-0128	1554-0774		WOS:000260486100004

Vibration spectra (Raman spectroscopy) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed to evaluate the correlation between crystal structures and vibration modes of these solid solutions as a function of Nb5+ ions replaced by Ta5+ ions. Spectroscopic and structural data show sensitivity to sample structural evolution with Ta5+ concentration. It is verified that these ceramics present a phase transition with increasing Ta5+ content, from cubic (x = 0 and x = 0.2) to hexagonal (x = 0.8 and x = 1). Raman results show that the samples of x = 0.4 and 0.6, which have a pseudocubic structure, are of the transition phases, and the 1:2 ordering degree increases and the BZNT ceramics decrease in the crystal symmetry with Ta5+ concentration. Tilting of oxygen octahedra is the main reason for phase transition. The phonon modes of the vibration spectra were assigned, the position and width were determined, and the correlation of phonon vibrations with the crystal structures for the different atoms substituted in B ''-site was found.

The metalloprotease FtsH has been suggested as responsible for the degradation of the D1 protein. We have analyzed the distribution and subunit structures of FtsH in spinach thylakoids and various membrane fractions derived from the thylakoids using clear native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. FtsH was found not only in the stroma thylakoids but also in the Photosystem II-enriched grana membranes. Monomeric, dimeric, and hexameric FtsH proteases were present as major subunit structures in thylakoids, whereas only hexameric FtsH proteases were detected in Triton X-100-solubilized Photosystem II membranes. Importantly, among the membrane fractions examined, hexameric FtsH proteases were most abundant in the Photosystem II membranes. In accordance with this finding, D1 degradation took place in the Photosystem II membranes under light stress. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation analysis of thylakoids and the Photosystem II membranes solubilized with n-dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside and a chemical cross-linking study of thylakoids showed localization of FtsH near the Photosystem II light-harvesting chlorophyll-protein super-complexes in the grana. These results suggest that part of the FtsH hexamers are juxtapositioned to PSII complexes in the grana in darkness, carrying out immediate degradation of the photodamaged D1 protein under light stress.									37	3	0	0	35	0	38				1083-351X		WOS:000285622600083	20921219

The relatively easy circulation of air, enhanced by the poor compaction of the spoil heaps, and the exothermic reaction of pyrite with oxygen may ignite coal tips. Rainwater infiltration and subsequent evaporation inside burning coal tips may create steam pressure, which, combined with humidity and slope steepness can then trigger landsliding. Based on mapping of debris slides and susceptibility factors such as burning (represented by positive surface temperature anomalies on thermographic imagery) and slope gradient, this study aims to define thresholds for debris slide susceptibility on coal tips and to map potential debris slide source areas on spoil heaps. The Belgian coal tips were used as study area. A DTM as well as ASTER Kinetic Surface Temperature products were used to measure slope gradients and temperature anomaly. Locations with typical characteristics of combustion (heat, red soil colour, steam and gasses), and debris slides were recorded in the field, and were used to identify thresholds beyond which debris sliding is generally observed: a temperature anomaly of > 0.5 K, when comparing the debris slide areas to the average temperature of the coal tip, and a slope gradient a >= 28 degrees. The susceptibility zones for debris slide detachment were mapped by considering the imagery pixels that exceeded the thresholds for temperature and slope gradient; the results fitted well when compared with the observed debris slides. The method can be improved by using more coal tips for calibration, and by taking into account rain depth and slope aspect.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0372-8854			WOS:000301829200003

Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. The mutant, designated as SNC1, required PG supplementation for growth. Growth was repressed in PG-free medium concomitantly with the decrease in cellular content of PC. These results indicate that PG is essential, and that SNC1 is defective in PG synthesis. Decrease in PC content was accompanied by a reduction in the cellular content of chlorophyll. but with little effect on the contents of phycobilisome pigments, which showed that levels of chlorophyll-protein complexes decreased without alteration of those of phycobilisomes. Regardless of the decrease in the PG content. CO2-dependent photosynthesis by SNC1 was similar to that by the wild type on a chlorophyll basis, but consequently became lower on a cell basis. Simultaneously, the ratio of oxygen evolution of photosystem II (PSII) measured with p-benzoquinone to that of CO2-dependent photosynthesis, which ranged between 1.3 and 1.7 in the wild type. However. it was decreased in SNC1 from 1.3 to 0.4 during the early growth phase where chlorophyll content and CO2-dependent photosynthesis were little affected, and then finally to 0.1. suggesting that PSII first lost its ability to reduce p-benzoquinone and then decreased in its level and actual activity. These results indicate that PG contributes to the accumulation of chlorophyll-protein complexes in thylakoid membranes, and also to normal functioning of PSII.									130	10	0	0	115	0	138			0027-8424			WOS:000089341400066	10984546

The phase transitions and nucleation kinetics were studied by time resolved x-ray diffraction, Rietveld, Raman spectroscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy. Findings have shown that, an atomic disorder dominates from room temperature to 400 degrees C. Nanoparticles with crystal size < 26 nm start through nuclei formation of La0.7Sr0.3Cr0.4Mn0.6O3-delta and SrCrO4 solid solutions with Pm<(3)over bar>m cubic and P2(1)/n monoclinic symmetry respectively in the range of 600-650 degrees C. Symmetry reduction from the Pm (3) over barm -> R (3) over barc space group had been obtained at a lower temperature (750 degrees C) than those reported in the literature in oxygen atmosphere and it was confirmed by an octahedral distortion, which takes place in the crystallographic direction[2 (2) over bar1]/(1 (2) over bar2). The Johnson-Mehl-Avrami model had described the whole process, where the existence of two phases was shown before it reached its complete D-3d(6) point group symmetry.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1002-0071	1745-5391		WOS:000393208500022

Uncertainty exists in the literature, with two values differing by similar to 80 mV. Here, we have resolved this discrepancy by using spectroelectrochemistry on plant PSII-enriched membranes. Removal of bicarbonate (HCO3-) shifts the E-m from similar to-145 mV to -70 mV. The higher values reported earlier are attributed to the loss of HCO3- during the titrations (pH 6.5, stirred under argon gassing). These findings mean that HCO3- binds less strongly when Q(A)(-center dot) is present. Light-induced Q(A)(-center dot) formation triggered HCO3- loss as manifest by the slowed electron transfer and the upshift in the E-m of Q(A). HCO3--depleted PSII also showed diminished light-induced O-1(2) formation. This finding is consistent with a model in which the increase in the E-m of Q(A)/Q(A)(-center dot) promotes safe, direct P(+center dot)Q(A)(-center dot) charge recombination at the expense of the damaging back-reaction route that involves chlorophyll triplet-mediated O-1(2) formation [Johnson GN, et al. (1995) Biochim Biophys Acta 1229:202-207]. These findings provide a redox tuning mechanism, in which the interdependence of the redox state of Q(A) and the binding by HCO3- regulates and protects PSII. The potential for a sink (CO2) to source (PSII) feedback mechanism is discussed.									77	1	0	0	65	0	77			0027-8424			WOS:000386087100056	27791001

Toluene/o-xylene monooxygenase hydroxylase is a dioxygen-activating enzyme. Structural analysis suggests two possible pathways for dioxygen access through the a-subunit to the diiron center: a channel or a series of hydrophobic cavities. To distinguish which is utilized as the O-2 migration pathway, the dimensions of the cavities and the channel were independently varied by site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by X-ray crystallography. The rate constants for dioxygen access to the diiron center were derived from the formation rates of a peroxodiiron(III) intermediate, generated upon treatment of the diiron(II) enzyme with O-2. This reaction depends on the concentration of dioxygen to the first order. Altering the dimensions of the cavities, but not the channel, changed the rate of dioxygen reactivity with the enzyme. These results strongly suggest that voids comprising the cavities in toluene/o-xylene monooxygenase hydroxylase are not artifacts of protein packing/folding, but rather programmed routes for dioxygen migration through the protein matrix. Because the cavities are not fully connected into the diiron active center in the enzyme resting state, conformational changes will be required to facilitate dioxygen access to the diiron center. We propose that such temporary opening and closing of the cavities may occur in all bacterial multicomponent monooxygenases to control O-2 consumption for efficient catalysis. Our findings suggest that other gas-utilizing enzymes may employ similar structural features to effect substrate passage through a protein matrix.									21	0	0	0	14	0	21			0027-8424			WOS:000294543400023	21859951

In this work, we proposed a synthetic method based on both molecule and nanostructure design to prepare cyclomatrix polyphosphazene frameworks in a green and sustainable manner without any solvent. Using block copolymer Pluronic F127 as the structural directing agent and porogen, the synthesized product was assembled by nanosheets with a mesoporous structure. The generality of the proposed strategy was also examined in depth. After being doped with cobalt, its structure-property relationship was studied in flame retarding polypropylene (PP). Polyphosphazene with a high specific surface area and unique morphology was first applied as an eco-friendly halogen-free flame retardant. With the addition of 18 wt% of the product, the flame retardant PP composite achieved a UL-94V-0 rating, with a limiting oxygen index of 26.7%. The peak of heat release rate and total smoke production were also reduced by 60.5% and 32.6%, respectively. The composite exhibited an outstanding water resistance, as evidenced by constant V-0 rating after soaking in water for 3 days. This systematic research will shed light on the advanced structural design and eco-benign synthesis strategy of polyphosphazene for more feasible applications.									33	0	0	0	3	0	33			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000537398200005		
J	Aznar, CP; Britt, RD								Simulations of the H-1 electron spin echo-electron nuclear double resonance and H-2 electron spin echo envelope modulation spectra of exchangeable hydrogen nuclei coupled to the S-2-state photosystem II manganese cluster								PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON SERIES B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				357	1426			1359	1365		10.1098/rstb.2002.1144				OCT 29 2002	2002	The pulsed EPR methods of electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) and electron spin echoelectron nuclear double resonance (ESE-ENDOR) are used to investigate the proximity of exchangeable hydrogens around the paramagnetic S-2-state Mn cluster of the photosystem II oxygen-evolving complex. Although ESEEM and ESE-ENDOR are both pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance techniques, the specific mechanisms by which nuclear spin transitions are observed are quite different. We are able to generate good simulations of both H-1 ESE-ENDOR and H-2 ESEEM signatures of exchangeable hydrogens at the S-2-state cluster. The convergence of simulation parameters for both methods provides a high degree of confidence in the simulations. Several exchangeable protons-deuterons with strong dipolar couplings are observed. In the simulations, two of the close (approximate to2.5 Angstrom) hydrogen nuclei exhibit strong isotropic couplings and are therefore most probably associated with direct substrate ligation to paramagnetic Mn. Another two of the close (approximate to2.7 Angstrom) hydrogen nuclei show no isotropic couplings and are therefore most probably not contained in Mn ligands. We suggest that these proximal hydrogens may be associated with a Ca2+-bound substrate, as indicated in recent mechanistic proposals for O-2 formation.

For the first time, we report a novel hybrid-photoanode built from ultrathin NiFe-MOF and TiO2 by a sacrifice template method. The in-situ etch of NiFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH) on the surface of TiO2 has been successfully realized in the coordination environment, for creating coordinately unsaturated metal sites on NiFe-MOF. The coordinately unsaturated metal sites could significantly promote the water oxidation kinetic, compared with conventional electrode/electrolyte interface. The photocurrent density of the NiFe-MOF/TiO2 has reached about 3.35 times of bare TiO2 at 1.23 V (vs. RHE), and the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) value has been improved up to 42% (at 390 nm). The significant augment of the charge injection (eta(injection)) of 92.8% and charge separation (eta(separation)) efficiency of 37.4% has also been exhibited. Moreover, NiFe-MOF/TiO2 shows a long-term stability (< 10% decay) after 4 h of continuous illumination. This work provided a novel and rational strategy about the integration of the inorganic semiconductor and organic MOF, which can provide a new insight into understanding MOF-based catalysts for PEC water splitting.

In the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, psbH is located upstream of the cytochrome b6-f complex genes petC and petA. In striking contrast, in the genomes of plant chloroplasts, psbH is cotranscribed with petB and petD, encoding the other two major subunits of the cytochrome b6-f complex. We report that in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 monocistronic psbH and dicistronic petCA transcripts are probably initiated separately, each from DNA regions bearing some similarity to Escherichia coli sigma70 promoters. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 psbH null mutants were generated by cartridge mutagenesis. Studies using a rapid screening procedure involving in situ complementation showed that the PsbH protein is not absolutely required for the assembly of a functionally active photosystem 2 complex since psbH insertion and deletion strains were able to grow photoautotrophically. The rate of photoautotrophic growth was, however, slower than the wild type, and studies of oxygen evolution, chlorophyll fluorescence, and thermoluminescence indicated that this reduction in growth rate is probably due mainly to an impairment in electron flow from Q(A) to Q(B). We conclude, therefore, that the PsbH protein is not an absolute requirement for photosystem 2 activity but that it functions to optimize electron flow between the two secondary plastoquinone acceptors by interacting with the Q(B) site on the D1 protein.									82	2	0	0	78	0	85			0006-2960			WOS:A1993KM70300008	8431425

Herein, an electrocatalyst (described as Fe-N-C/Fe100-x-y-zPxOyNz/NPC, NPC is N, P co-doped carbon) composed of multiple active components, such as NPC, iron-based porous hollow spheres and Fe-N-C, is reported, which exhibits an excellent activity that is comparable to state-of-the-art Pt/C for half-cell and full zinc-air battery in alkaline media. This catalyst exhibits an excellent activity with a half-wave potential of 0.86 V for the ORR in alkaline media, which is 10 mV more positive than to that of PVC (0.85 V), and a gravimetric energy density for zinc-air battery is up to 675 Wh Kg(zn)(-1). The excellent activity is attributed to the synergetic effect of active NPC, iron-based porous hollow spheres (Fe100-x-y-zPxOyNz) and Fe-N-C in its structure. In addition, phosphoric acid groups are partially remained in the structure for our catalyst that make the catalyst excellent hydrophilicity. This work adds a new member into family of non-precious metal-based ORR electrocatalysts.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000472176900061

Consequently, the development of active and stable water oxidation catalysts is crucial, with heterogeneous systems(3,4) considered more suitable for practical use and their homogeneous counterparts more suitable for targeted, molecular-level design guided by mechanistic understanding(5-19). Research into the mechanism of water oxidation has resulted in a range of synthetic molecular catalysts, yet there remains much interest in systems that use abundant, inexpensive and environmentally benign metals such as iron (the most abundant transition metal in the Earth's crust and found in natural(20,21) and synthetic(22) oxidation catalysts). Water oxidation catalysts based on mononuclear iron complexes have been explored(9,12,16,18), but they often deactivate rapidly and exhibit relatively low activities. Here we report a pentanuclear iron complex that efficiently and robustly catalyses water oxidation with a turnover frequency of 1,900 per second, which is about three orders of magnitude larger than that of other iron-based catalysts. Electrochemical analysis confirms the redox flexibility of the system, characterized by six different oxidation states between Fe-5(II) and Fe-5(III); the Fe-5(III) state is active for oxidizing water. Quantum chemistry calculations indicate that the presence of adjacent active sites facilitates O-O bond formation with a reaction barrier of less than ten kilocalories per mole. Although the need for a high overpotential and the inability to operate in water-rich solutions limit the practicality of the present system, our findings clearly indicate that efficient water oxidation catalysts based on iron complexes can be created by ensuring that the system has redox flexibility and contains adjacent water-activation sites.									294	12	0	0	36	0	296			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000370690800032	26863188

Over the last 60 years, the arrival of two viral diseases, myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease, have led to dramatic declines in wild rabbit populations across the Iberian Peninsula. These diseases are currently endemic. Periodic outbreaks occur and have significant impacts on wild populations. Both infection types have diverse physiological effects on their hosts that are rooted in aerobic metabolic processes. To fight off these viruses, rabbits activate their immune systems. However, the production of immune defences generates reactive oxygen species that may consequently damage host tissues. Hypothesising that immune responses increase oxidative stress, we examined whether wild rabbits naturally infected with myxoma virus (MV) and rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) had high oxidative stress. Using blood samples, we measured anti-MV and anti-RHDV antibody concentrations and different oxidative stress markers (i.e., glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and malondialdehyde). Our results show that rabbits that were seropositive for both MV and RHDV had high concentrations of malondialdehyde. Age and body condition were also positively related to dual seropositivity. No significant relationships were observed between serostatus and the concentrations of the other oxidative stress markers. Although we expected infection with MV and RHDV to be correlated with oxidative stress, the influence of external sources of oxidative stress (e.g., climatic conditions) likely made it more difficult to detect such relationships in wild rabbits.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1612-4642	1439-0574		WOS:000439697000001

The pulsation spectrum of PG 1456+103 is complicated and variable on timescales of approximately 1 week and could only partly be deciphered with our measurements. The modes of CBS114 are more stable in time and we were able to arrive at a frequency solution somewhat affected by aliasing, but still satisfactory, involving seven independent modes and two combination frequencies. These frequencies also explain the discovery data of the star, taken 13 yr earlier.We find a mean period spacing of 37.1 +/- 0.7 s significant at the 98 per cent level between the independent modes of CBS 114 and argue that they are caused by non-radial g-mode pulsations of spherical degree l = 1. We performed a global search for asteroseismological models of CBS 114 using a genetic algorithm, and we examined the susceptibility of the results to the uncertainties of the observational frequency determinations and mode identifications (we could not provide m values). The families of possible solutions are identified correctly even without knowledge of m. Our best-fitting model suggests T(eff) = 21 000 K, M(*) = 0.730 M. and log(M(He)/M(*)) = 6.66, X(O) = 0.61. The latter value of the central oxygen mass fraction implies a rate for the (12)C(alpha, gamma)(16)O nuclear reaction near S(300) = 180 keV b, consistent with laboratory measurements.									18	2	0	0	0	0	18			0035-8711			WOS:000178283100023		
J	Xiao, Hong-Mei; Zhan, Mao-Sheng; Xu, Wen; Ding, Xiao-jun								Microstructure Evolution of SW/EPN Composites During Hot Air Aging								JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE				131	8					40128	10.1002/app.40128				APR 15 2014	2014	In this article, the hot air aging of high strength glass fiber fabric/epoxy novolac resin (SW/EPN) composites was investigated by the aid of the aging behavior of EPN, mainly focusing on the microstructure evolvement of SW/EPN composites. The aging mechanism and thermal mechanical properties of SW/EPN composites were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermo-gravimetric analyzer coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis. The results showed that micro cracks initiated and propagated at the fiber-matrix interphase because of the heat and oxygen effect. After long-time aging at elevated temperatures, delamination phenomenon was discovered in SW/EPN composites. The results of weight changes showed that the degradation of EPN played a major role in SW/EPN composites. Moreover, the degradation of EPN contained post-curing, oxidation, and decomposition. The results also revealed that unaged EPN indicated two glass transition temperatures (T-g1 and T-g2). T-g1 increased for post curing while T-g2 decreased for oxidation with increasing of aging time and temperature. In the final period of aging at higher temperatures, only one T-g was observed because the formation of perfect crosslinked networks made EPN homogeneous. In addition, the relationship between T-g and chemical structure, as well as T-g and mass loss, confirmed that the variation of T-g depended on chemical changes. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J.

Many efforts have been conducted to overcome this limitation in which the semiconductor-semiconductor coupling strategies toward heterojunction formation were considered as the easiest but the most effective method. Herein, a one-pot solid-state reaction of thiourea and sodium molybdate as precursors at different temperatures under N-2 gas was applied for preparing composites of MoS2/g-C3N4. The physicochemical characterization of the final products determines the variation in contents of components (MoS2 and g-C3N4) via the increase of synthesis temperature. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the MoS2/g-C3N4 composites was evaluated by the degradation of Rhodamine B in an aqueous solution under visible light. Therein, composites synthesized at 500 degrees C showed the best photocatalytic performance with a degradation efficiency of 90%, much higher than that of single g-C3N4. The significant improvement in photocatalytic performance is attributed to the enhancement in light-harvesting and extension in photo-induced charge carriers' lifetime of composites which are originated from the synergic effect between the components. Besides, the photocatalytic mechanism is demonstrated to well-fit into the S-scheme pathway with apparent evidences.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20			2045-2322			WOS:000692201400004	34285258

Henceforth, catalysts with single-atom dispersions are highly desirable to maximize their mass efficiency, but fabricating these structures using a controllable method is still challenging. Most previous studies have focused on crystalline materials. However, amorphous materials may have enhanced performance due to their distorted and isotropic nature with numerous defects. Here reported is the facile synthesis of an atomically dispersed catalyst that consists of single Pt atoms and amorphous Fe2O3 nanosheets. Rational control can regulate the morphology from single atom clusters to sub-nanoparticles. Density functional theory calculations show the synergistic effect resulted from the strong binding and stabilization of single Pt atoms with the strong metal-support interaction between the in situ locally anchored Pt atoms and Fe2O3 lead to a weak CO adsorption. Moreover, the distorted amorphous Fe2O3 with O vacancies is beneficial for the activation of O-2, which further facilitates CO oxidation on nearby Pt sites or interface sites between Pt and Fe2O3, resulting in the extremely high performance for CO oxidation of the atomic catalyst.									28	4	0	0	3	0	30			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000481112300001		
J	Li, Yu; Fan, Weidong								Effect of char gasification on NOx formation process in the deep air-staged combustion in a 20 kW down flame furnace								APPLIED ENERGY				164				258	267		10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.11.048				FEB 15 2016	2016	Deep air-staged combustion tests of Datong (DT) bituminous coal were carried out in a 20 kW down flame furnace (DFF) with the burner stoichiometric ratio (SR) ranging from 1.200 (unstaged) to as low as 0.696 (deep staged). The experimental results shown that the concentration of CO reach as high as 120,000 ppm (12 vol.%) and the NOx decrease to nearly zero in the reducing zone under deep staging conditions of SR = 0.696, which was never observed before. Thus, the extent of CO formation (i.e. char gasification) and the NOx reaction mechanism under deep staging condition were studied in order to understand the combustion process of coal. This paper presents a refined numerical simulation for reproducing the profiles of CO and NOx along the DFF under deep staging condition. The comparison between simulation and experimental results prove the reasonability of refined kinetic parameters of char gasification. The enhancement of char gasification by CO2 is proposed and validated. With the simulated CO profile in the DFF confirmed by experiment, the NOx profile could be further analyzed. The discrepancy of simulated NOx profile in the reducing zone (i.e. fuel-rich zone) indicates that there are some undetected nitrogenous species and undiscovered NOx transfer mechanism regardless of the consistence of final NOx emission between simulation and experiment. It is supposed by us that a majority of NOx immersing in high level of CO in the reducing zone is mainly transferred into undetected nitrogenous species (excluding HCN and NH3) which is then rapidly oxidized into NOx once the remaining oxygen is injected into the DFF.

The titanium matrix composites are hot rolled with degrees of deformation of 60%, 80%, 90% and 95%. The effects of the hot rolling degree of deformation on the mechanical properties of the composites are investigated by experiment and modeling. In particular, the variation in the inclination of the TiB whiskers during rolling is quantified in the model. The results show that, with increasing degree of deformation, the mechanical properties of composites are improved. Modeling of the mechanical properties reveals that grain refinement and TiB whisker rotation during rolling contribute to the improvement in the yield strength of the titanium matrix composites. Electron backscatter diffraction and transmission electron microscopy observations are used to study the texture of the composites. It is found that the orientation relationships between Ti matrix and TiB whiskers are [11-20](Ti) parallel to [0 1 0](TiB), (0 0 0 1)(Ti) parallel to (0 0 1)(TiB) and (1-1 0 0)(Ti) parallel to(1 0 0)(TiB). TiB whiskers rotate in the rolling direction (RD) with increasing degree of deformation, which results in a higher intensity [11-20](Ti) parallel to RD fiber due to the special orientation relationship between TiB and the Ti matrix.

Here, a combination of new sulfur isotope data, mineral composition and abundance data, and consideration of mineral textures is used to link assimilation of surface-derived Martian sulfate to oxidation of nakhlite melts. The magnitudes of the mass independent sulfur isotope signatures (negative Delta S-33) and the abundance of sulfide minerals accounts for much of the added oxygen implied by the occurrence of abundant skeletal titanomagnetite in the MIL pairs. Assimilation and reduction of sulfate amounts equivalent to that from 10's of centimeters of Martian sediment are required to account for an oxidation front extending similar to 1 m into the flow, a position previously proposed for MIL 03346, and implies a position at the bottom, rather than the top of a nakhlite flow. A similar positional and amount constraint is required for an alternative path for assimilation of sulfate from sulfate-rich brine. Assimilation and reduction of sulfate is therefore inferred to play a critical role in establishing both the enrichment in skeletal titanomagnetite within the lower portion of the nakhlite pile and the large Delta S-33 anomalies of the MIL pairs. Other nakhlites with smaller Delta S-33 anomalies and less titanomagnetite would occupy positions farther away from the source of sulfate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

It is proposed that the O-O bond formation mechanism is different in the gas phase and in a water solution. In the gas phase, upon phosphate ligand dissociation triggered by light absorption, the O-O bond formation starting with both the Mn-4(III,III,IV,IV) and Mn-4(III,IV,IV,IV) oxidation states has to take place via direct coupling of two bridging oxo groups. The calculated barriers are 42.3 and 37.1 kcal/mol, respectively, and there is an endergonicity of more than 10 kcal/mol. Additional photons are needed to overcome these large barriers. In water solution, water binding to the two vacant sites of the Mn ions, again after phosphate dissociation triggered by light absorption, is thermodynamically and kinetically very favorable. The catalytic cycle is suggested to start from the Mn-4(III,III,III,IV) oxidation state. The removal of three electrons and three protons leads to the formation of a Mn-4(III,IV,IV,IV)-oxyl radical complex. The O-O bond formation then proceeds via a nucleophilic attack of water on the Mn-IV-oxyl radical assisted by a Mn-bound hydroxide that abstracts a proton during the attack. This step was calculated to be rate-limiting with a total barrier of 29.2 kcal/mol. This is followed by proton-coupled electron transfer, O-2 release, and water binding to start the next catalytic cycle. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Molybdenum concentration in the quenched experimental condensates ranged from 3 to 481 ppm. The corresponding molybdenum fugacity increased exponentially with increasing water fugacity, indicating that the dissolution of MoO3 proceeded via the reaction: MoO3,(s) broken vertical bar yH(2)O(g) = MoO3(H2O)(y) K-s1,(y) and that the hydration number (y) increases with increasing water fugacity. A set of equilibrium constants (Ks1, y) was calculated from the experimental results and fitted to a linear function involving the reciprocal of temperature for values of y between two and eight, and to a polynomial function for a hydration number of one. Modelling of an H-Cl-S-O-bearing intermediate density supercritical fluid shows that molybdenite solubility is increasingly sensitive with decreasing temperature to changes in oxygen fugacity due to fluid-rock interaction. In a H2S-SO2 gas-buffered, intermediate density fluid containing 1 wt% S, the molybdenum concentration decreases with decreasing temperature and pressure from 89 to 0.07 ppm. Values of MoO3 solubility calculated using the thermodynamic data reported in this study for temperatures and pressures above the range considered in our experiments agree well with those determined experimentally by other researchers. Moreover, the predicted Mo concentrations are similar to those measured in vapour and intermediate density fluid inclusions from Cu-Mo and Mo porphyry deposits. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Harnessing Redox-Active Ligands for Low-Barrier Radical Addition at Oxorhenium Complexes								INORGANIC CHEMISTRY				50	20			9864	9878		10.1021/ic200923q				OCT 17 2011	2011	The addition of an [X](+) electrophile to the five-coordinate oxorhenium (V) anion [Re-V(O)(ap(Ph))(2)](-) {[ap(Ph)](2-) = 2,4-di-tert-butyl-6-(phenylamido)phenolate} gives new products containing Re-X bonds. The Re-X bond-forming reaction is analogous to oxo transfer to [Re-V(O)(ap(Ph))(2)](-) in that both are 2e(-) redox processes, but the electronic structures of the products are different. Whereas oxo addition to [Re-V(O)(ap(Ph))(2)](-) yeilds a closed-shell [Re-VII(O)(2)(ap(Ph))(2)](-) product of 2e(-) metal oxidation, [Cl](+) addition gives a diradical Re-VI(O)(ap(Ph))(isq(Ph))Cl product ([isqPh](center dot-) = 2,4-di-tert-butyl-6-(phenylimino)semiquinonate) with le(-) in a Re d orbital and le(-) on a redox-active ligand. The differences in electronic structure are ascribed to differences in the pi basicity of [O](2-) and Cl- ligands. The observation of ligand radicals in Re-IV(O)(ap(Ph))(isq(Ph))X provides experimental support for the capacity of redox-active ligands to deliver electrons in other bond-forming reactions at [Re-V(O)(ap(Ph))(2)](-), including radical additions of O-2 or TEMPO center dot to make Re-O bonds. Attempts to prepare the electron-tranfer series monomers between Re-VI(O)(ap(Ph))(isq(Ph))X and [Re-V(O)(ap(Ph))(2)](-) yeilded a symmetric bis(mu-oxo)dirhenium complex. Formation of this dimer suggested that Re-VI(O)(ap(Ph))(isq(Ph))Cl may be a source of an oxyl metal fragment. The ability of Re-VI(O)(ap(Ph))(isq(Ph))Cl to undergo radical coupling at oxo was revealed in its reaction with Ph3C center dot, which affords Ph3COH and deoxygenated methal products. This reactivity is surprising because Re-VI(O)(ap(Ph))(isq(Ph))Cl is not a strong outer-sphere oxidant or oxo-transfer reagent. We postulate that the unique ability of Re-VI(O)(ap(Ph))(isq(Ph))Cl to effect oxo transfer to Ph3C center dot arises from symmetry-allowed mixing of a populated Re O pi bond with a lignad-centered [isq(Ph)](center dot-) ligand radical, which give oxyl radical character to the oxo ligand. This allows the closed-shell oxo ligand to undergo a net 2e(-) oxo-transfer reaction to Ph3C center dot via kinetically facile redox-active ligand-mediated radical steps. Harnessing intraligand charge transfer for radical reactions at closed-shell oxo ligands is a new strategy to exploit redox-active ligands for small-molecule activation and functionalization. The implications for the design of new oxidants that utilize low-barrier radical steps for selective multielectron transformation are discussed.									38	0	0	0	4	0	38			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000295602500012	21744815

To date, much research has been conducted on the ingenious design and rational construction of GQDs-based nanomaterials used as electrode materials and/or electrocatalysts. Despite these efforts, research on the efficient synthesis and application of GQDs-based nanomaterials is still in the early stages of development and timely updates of recent research progress on new design concepts, synthetic strategies, and significant breakthroughs in GQDs-based nanomaterials are highly desired. In light of the above, the effect of synthetic methods on the final product of the GQDs, the GQDs synthesis mechanism, and specific perspectives regarding the effect of the unique surface and structural properties of GQDs (e.g., defects, heteroatom doping, surface/edge state, size, conductivity) on the electrochemical energy-related systems are discussed in-depth in this review. Additionally, this review also focuses on the design of GQDs-based composites and their applications in the fields of electrochemical energy storage (e.g., supercapacitors and batteries) and electrocatalysis (e.g., fuel cell, water splitting, CO(2)reduction), along with constructive suggestions for addressing the remaining challenges in the field.									88	3	0	0	6	0	88			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000541474600001

However, calendering high-nickel cathodes leads to electrode particle pulverization, raising concerns of a reduced cycle life due to parasitic side reactions. We present here an investigation of the impact of calendering on the morphology and electrochemical performance of the cobalt-free layered oxide cathode LiNi0.9Mn0.05Al0.05O2 (NMA-90). We find that secondary particle pulverization and fusion simultaneously occur at sufficiently high pressures. The initial surface area of the cathode is shown to increase with the degree of calendering, despite the higher likelihood of secondary particle fusion. Long-term cycling of full coin cells assembled with the NMA-90 cathode and the graphite anode indicates that cells with higher degrees of cathode calendering exhibit lower capacity fade compared to uncalendered cathodes. Hybrid pulse-power tests demonstrate that the usable capacity range of cells with calendered cathodes far exceeds those with uncalendered cells after long-term cycling. The improved capacity retention and pulse-power performance are attributed to the enhanced mechanical properties of the electrode after calendering that prevents loss of the primary particle contact during long-term cycling. We find that calendering high-nickel NMA-90 to industrially relevant densities does not have a detrimental effect on capacity fade, marking an important step toward commercial adoption.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000697282300053	34459575

This, in turn, is making fossil fuels dwindle faster and cause more negative environmental impacts. Thus, alternative, environmentally friendly energy sources such as fuel cells and electrolyzers are being developed. While significant progress has already been made in this area, such energy systems are still hard to scale up because of their noble metal catalysts. In this concept paper, first, various scalable nanocarbon-based electrocatalysts that are being synthesized for energy conversions in these energy systems are introduced. Next, notable heteroatom-doping and nanostructuring strategies that are applied to produce different nanostructured carbon materials with high electrocatalytic activities for energy conversions are discussed. The concepts used to develop such materials with different structures and large density of dopant-based catalytic functional groups in a sustainable way, and the challenges therein, are emphasized in the discussions. The discussions also include the importance of various analytical, theoretical, and computational methods to probe the relationships between the compositions, structures, dopants, and active catalytic sites in such materials. These studies, coupled with experimental studies, can further guide innovative synthetic routes to efficient nanostructured carbon electrocatalysts for practical, large-scale energy conversion applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000640225100001	33856111

Up-to-date, the exact catalytic mechanism of the enzyme and the relationship between substrate moieties and the ligands within the active site microenvironment are still not resolved. Here, we set out to explore the possible involvement of hydroperoxyl radicals ((OOH)-O-.) in the catalytic dismutaion by following the interplay of Mn-III/Mn-II redox transitions, ligands binding, and evolution or consumption of superoxide radical, using a new model system. The model system encompassed an Mn atom chelated by a bacteriochlorophyll allomer macrocycle (BChl) in aerated aprotic media that contain residual water. The redox states of the Mn ion were monitored by the Q(y) electronic transitions at 774 and 825 nm for [Mn-II]- and [Mn-III]-BChl, respectively (Geskes, C.; Hartwich, G.; Scheer, H.; Mantele, W.; Heinze, J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 7776) and confirmed by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. Evolution of (OOH)-O-. radicals was monitored by the ESR spin-trap technique using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO). The experimental data suggest that the [Mn]-BChl forms a (HO-)[Mn-III]-BChl(OOH) complex upon solvation. Spectrophotometeric titrations with tetrabutylamonnium acetate (TBAA) and 1-methylimidazole (1-Melm) together with ESI-MS measurements indicated the formation of a 1:1 complex with [Mn]-BChl for both ligands. The coordination of ligands at low concentrations to [Mn-III]-BChl induced a release of a (OOH)-O-. radical and a [Mn-III]-BChl --> [Mn-II]-BChl transition at higher concentrations. The estimated equilibrium constants for the total redox reaction (K-tot) are 1.9 x 101 1 x 10(3) M-1 and 12.3 +/- 0.6 M-1 for TBAA and 1-Melm, respectively. The profound difference between the equilibrium constants agrees with the suggested key role of the ligand's basicity in the process. A direct interaction of superoxide radicals with [Mn-III]-BChl in a KO2 acetonitrile (AN) solution also resulted in [Mn-III]-BChl --> [Mn-II]-BChl transition. Cumulatively, our data show that the Mn-III center encourages the protonation of the O-2(-.) radical in an aprotic environment containing residual water molecules, while promoting its oxidation in the presence of basic ligands. Similar coordination and stabilization of the (OOH)-O-. radical by the Mn center may be key steps in the enzymatic dismutation of superoxide radicals by Mn-SOD.									13	0	0	0	6	0	14			0002-7863			WOS:000184243000041	12862482

Water-splitting photocatalysts have been attracting attention because they can produce hydrogen (H-2), which is attractive as a next-generation energy source, from solar energy and water. However, further improvement of water-splitting photocatalysts is required for their practical use in society. Recent studies have demonstrated that the active sites (cocatalysts) of water-splitting photocatalysts can be controlled using the advanced NP/NC syntheses and structural modulation techniques established in the fields of colloid, NP, and NC chemistry and thereby highly active water-splitting photocatalysts can be developed. If such research progresses further, it is expected that a transition to a new society using H(2)as the main energy source will become possible. However, such applied research has just started and examples of such research are currently limited. The purpose of this review is to introduce the importance of controlled colloidal NPs/NCs in research on water-splitting photocatalysis to readers by summarizing the existing research. We hope that this review will raise interest in the application of metal NPs/NCs in water-splitting photocatalysis and that a society actively addressing energy and environmental problems will become a reality as soon as possible.									31	0	0	0	1	0	31			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000561168500003

Nevertheless, tunable control over directional charge transfer in photocatalysis to ideal reaction sites still constitutes a challenging task. In this work, cadmium sulfide (CdS), one of the most quintessential transition metal sulfides, was used to demonstrate how to progressively construct a cascade charge transfer channel via in situ phase self-transformation coupled with favorable interface engineering. The in situ phase self-transformation of CdS to CdSe on the surface was triggered followed by electrostatic self-assembly of MoS2 quantum dots (QDs) on the CdS@CdSe core-shell nanostructure, resulting in a CdS@CdSe-MoS2 QD ternary heterostructure with well-defined tailor-made interfaces. Significantly, CdS@CdSe-MoS2 QDs demonstrated conspicuously enhanced photocatalytic water splitting performance in comparison with their single and binary counterparts under visible light irradiation along with favorable photostability and substantial apparent quantum yield. This is predominantly ascribed to the generation of a cascade charge transport channel in the ternary heterostructure arising from the cooperativity of in situ CdSe encapsulation and pinpoint MoS2 QD decoration. More importantly, the in situ formed ultrathin CdSe interlayer plays a crucial role in mediating the charge transfer cascade, affording suitable energy level alignment, and shielding the defect sites of CdS NWs, thereby markedly retarding charge recombination and prolonging the lifetime of charge carriers. Furthermore, self-assembled MoS2 QDs on the CdS@CdSe core-shell framework further contribute to the directional charge flow to the active sites for hydrogen production.									43	1	0	0	7	0	43			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000465152700024

The physicochemical characterizations of the catalyst carried out by surface area analyzer, x-ray diffraction (XRD), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron microscopes measurements suggest the formation of crystalline nanoparticles structure of NiO. The surface area of Ni/NiO prepared using EG/water mixture reaches 70 m(2) g(-1) which is 2-fold enhsancement in surface area in comparison with NiO prepared in pure EG and an order of magnitude higher than that of bulk nickel prepared in pure water. The methanol electro-oxidation activity of the Ni/NiO nanoparticles obtained in EG/water mixture displayed more than 4-fold increase in oxidation current at 1.7 V versus RHE in comparison with NiO nanoparticles obtained in EG and 20-fold increase compared to bulk nickel catalyst concord with the enhancement of electro-active surface area. The results show the Ni/NiO nanoparticles produced by microwave assisted synthesis has superior activity for methanol oxidation in alkaline solution over the other nickel based catalysts and has potential for mass production.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2053-1591			WOS:000415118700003

Herein, a ternary metal-organic framework nanoarray is in situ hydrothermally deposited on Ni foam via assembling of multiple metal ions (Co2+, Ni2+ and Fe2+) and 2-amino-terephthalic acid. The integrated MOF composite can directly act as a catalytic electrode, which exhibits excellent electrocatalytic HMF oxidation activity with a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at a potential of only 1.35 V vs. RHE. More importantly, the constant potential electrolysis at 1.4 V vs. RHE in combination with chromatographic analysis reveals a high faradaic efficiency close to 100% towards the production of FDCA with a yield of 99.76%. The high electrocatalytic performance for HMF oxidation is attributed to the abundant accessible active sites of two-dimensional morphology and the optimized electronic structure of the intrinsic catalytic centers in MOFs. The present study sheds light on the rational design and synthesis of new MOF-based catalysts for biomass conversion and stimulate the extensive explorations of MOFs with tunable active sites for potential electrocatalysis applications.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000663023700001

For the direct electrooxidation, metallic catalysts were used, whose surfaces were modified by promoters or second catalysts. Bi-modified Pt electrodes (PtxBiy/C) served as model systems for promoter-supported electrocatalysis, whereas IrO2-modified RuO2 electrodes were studied as catalyst combinations, which were compared under acidic conditions with the respective monometallic catalysts (Pt/C, RuO2/Ti, IrO2/Ti). Furthermore, inorganic halide mediators (chloride, bromide, iodide) and organic nitroxyl mediators (4-oxo-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidin-1-oxyl and 4-acetamido-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidin-1-oxyl) were evaluated for indirect electrooxidation. These different approaches were discussed regarding selectivity, conversion, and coulombic efficiency of the electrochemical glycerol oxidation.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000651649900001	33945223

In our approach, the water for hydrolysis was slowly released by esterification reaction followed by a supercritical drying in ethyl alcohol. Vanadium doping concentration of 10 at% has been investigated. After treatment in air at different temperatures, the obtained nanopowder was characterized by various techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and photoluminescence (PL). Analysis by scanning electron microscopy at high resolution shows that the grain size increases with increasing temperature. Thus, in the case of thermal treatment at 500 degrees C in air, the powder with an average particle size of 25 nm shows a strong luminescence band in the visible range. The intensity and energy position of the obtained PL band depends on the temperature measurement increase. The mechanism of this emission band is discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This strategy addresses the challenge of narrowing the band gap of g-C3N4 while maintaining its high LUMO position. For this study, we introduced the above donor units into g-C3N4 to construct intramolecular D-A structures through the copolymerization of dicyandiamide with creatinine, which strategically extended light absorption into the green region and expedited photoelectron separation. The introduction of electron donor blocks kept the LUMO distributed on the melem, which maintained the high LUMO energy level of the copolymer with the potential to generate oxygen radicals. The as-prepared porous D-A conjugated polymer enhanced the photocatalytic degradation of sulfisoxazole with kinetic constants 5.6 times higher than that of g-C3N4 under blue light and 15.3 times higher under green light. Furthermore, we surveyed the degradation mechanism including the effective active species and degradation pathways. This study offers a new perspective for the synchronous construction of a porous intramolecular D-A conjugated polymer to enhance water treatment and environmental remediation capacities.									10	0	0	0	5	0	10			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000711851300005	34655871

The morphologies, crystal structures, chemical compositions, elemental states and optical properties of MgO/Cu2O and Au/MgO/Cu2O heterojunctions were characterized via SEM, XRD, XPS, UV-VIS-NIR and PL. It was found that the MIN has a surface passivation effect that inhibits the aggregation and oxidation of Cu2O. This enhances Cu2O semiconductors' wettability and stability, improves crystallinity and reduces Au particle sizes. More importantly, the MIN promotes charge transfer via tunneling through the insulator, and enhances adsorption of molecular oxygen, facilitating superoxide radicals formation during photoreactivity. MgO/Cu2O and Au/MgO/Cu2O exhibited superior photodegradation of methyl orange, attributed to the boost of % O2 (-) and h(+). This work confirmed the importance of MIN as a useful modification of semiconductor photocatalysts, and the MIN can significantly enhance the production of superoxide radicals in the photocatalytic activity with visible light.									12	0	0	0	3	0	12				2213-3437		WOS:000405370200060

Hundred Watt microwave power, a working pressure of 2 mTorr, a total gas flow rate of 20 seem, and 13.5 Watt radio frequency bias power were used. Refractive indices of 3.8 to 1.48 were measured by ellipsometry at a wavelength of 632.8 nm. Deposition rates for different SiH4/(SiH4 + O-2) gas flow ratios were between 4.3 and 7.5 nm min(-1). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed a gradual evolution of the chemical composition of the films from amorphous silicon to silicon dioxide with change in gas phase composition. For silicon dioxide films, the centre frequency of the main Si-O stretching band is 1060 cm(-1) whereas full width at half maximum is approximately 94 cm(-1). Presence of Si-OH bonds is not detectable for any of the films. The amount of hydrogen in the films is considerably less than that in similar layers deposited by radio frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition, and for amorphous silicon it does not exceed 1.5 X 10(22) cm(-3). The presence of a single band at 486 cm(-1) in the Raman spectrum of the a-Si film confirmed its amorphous structure. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Betts, SD; Ross, JR; Pichersky, E; Yocum, CF								Mutation Val235Ala weakens binding of the 33-kDa manganese stabilizing protein of photosystem II to one of two sites								BIOCHEMISTRY				36	13			4047	4053		10.1021/bi962413b				APR 1 1997	1997	The 33-kDa protein of the photosynthetic O-2-evolving complex, also known as manganese stabilizing protein, contributes to the structural stability of the photosystem II tetranuclear Mn cluster and stimulates the water-oxidizing activity of this cluster. Quantification of extrinsic polypeptides in photosystem II has yielded data that support stoichiometries of either one or two copies of each protein per photosystem II reaction center. We recently described the cold-sensitive assembly of a mutant 33-kDa protein with a single amino acid replacement (Val235Ala) [Betts, S. D., Ross, J. R., Pichersky, E., & Yocum, C. F. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 6302-6307]. We have extended the characterization of this mutation. When photosystem II membranes depleted of the 33 kDa extrinsic protein are exposed to mixtures of wild type and Val235Ala manganese stabilizing protein, binding of the wild type protein is strongly preferred. If, however, protein containing the Val235Ala mutation is first bound to photosystem II only half of this protein (about 1 mol/mol of photosystem II reaction centers) is susceptible to displacement by the wild type protein, even after multiple exposures to the latter. These results support the conclusion that 2 mol of manganese stabilizing protein are bound per reaction center. Our data show as well that the mutant 33-kDa protein competes with the wild type protein for at least one of two binding sites on photosystem II and that the mutant protein binds tightly to only one of two sites. These results demonstrate that the two binding sites on photosystem II for the 33-kDa protein have different properties with respect to recognition and binding of this protein.									47	1	0	0	41	0	47			0006-2960			WOS:A1997WR18000034	9092836

The optical and photo-electrochemical studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out and revealed that the product can promote the photogenerated charge separation and transfer efficiency and adjust energy band structure in different ways. The homojunction enhanced charge separation efficiency on the surface. O doping changed the charge arrangement in the homojunction and formed an internal electric field, which enhanced the charge separation efficiency in the bulk phase. Meanwhile, O doping also regulated the band structure by substituting the N atoms, thereby expanding the photo-response range. Furthermore, the nanosheets structure shortened the transfer distance of photogenerated charges from bulk phase to surface. Combined the multi-regulation behavior with active species analysis, the enhanced photocatalytic mechanism was proposed. Under the coaction of the O-2(-) and h(+), 2,4DCP was decomposed with intermediates of smaller organic acid molecules. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, a B,N,F-tridoped carbon material is successfully prepared on defect-rich sites by directly calcining two sodium salts, namely ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tetrasodium salt (Na4EDTA) and ammonium tetrafluoroborate (NH4BF4). B refers to electron-donating atoms while F and N are electron-accepting atoms. The co-existence of electron-donating and electron-accepting atoms causes an asymmetrical spin and charge density, favoring palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) well dispersed on the carbon matrix. The heteroatoms efficiently control over the growth of Pd NPs and regulate the internal electron density. The catalytic performance is significantly enhanced with the obtained Pd/BNF-C catalyst for formic acid dehydrogenation, which has a lower activation barrier (36.4 kJ/mol) and a better reusability than those of free-heteroatom catalysts. The efficiency might be attributed to the strong interaction between Pd NPs and heteroatoms, and the electrons transfer from carbon material to Pd NPs, with benefits including the significant coupling effect of B,N,F-tridoping down to the atomic scale, abundant surface active defects, in-plane nanopore defects and more adjacent metal active sites.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000807242200002

The phospholipid fatty acid and quantitative PCR analysis showed that the sludge circulating ratio of 75% resulted in a good microbial growth and a higher abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria relative to the nitrite oxidizing bacteria. The Betaproteobacteria were observed to compose the most abundant sludge bacterial groups in the two processes, based on phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic analysis of both 16S rRNA and amoA gene indicated that the Nitrosomonas sp. were the dominant ammonia oxidizing bacteria in the partial nitritation process. The relative abundance of nitrite oxidizing bacteria, such as Nitrobacter sp. and Nitrospira sp., were significantly lower in the partial nitritation system over the complete nitrification system. The abundance of Planctomycetes was higher in the partial nitritation process, indicating the anammox reaction occurred in the partial nitritation system. These results suggested the nitrite accumulation rate of circulating ratios 75% was the highest, with an average of 92%, and a possibility to treat the low Carbon Nitrogen ratio wastewater using the partial nitritation/anammox process.									10	0	0	0	8	0	10			2045-2322			WOS:000442917500002	30154517

Graphitic carbon nitride can be given as an example of metal-free and cheap semiconducting material for photoelectrochemical reactions however its activity is very low, probably due to high rate of unfavorable charge carriers recombination. Type II heterostructure, graphitic carbon nitride-copper oxide (g-C3N4 and CuO), showed improved photoelectrochemical activity in comparison with neat g-C3N4. Visible-light irradiated composite generates cathodic photocurrents under middle bias and therefore it can be used as a photocathode for water splitting with hydrogen formation. The band bending existing in type II heterostructures drives the photogenerated electrons and holes to move in opposite directions, resulting in a spatial separation of the photogenerated charge carriers on different sides of heterojunction. Lower recombination rate and higher activity are the overall effects. Moreover, by using copper based underlayer (metallic copper) or overlayer (copper iodide) the PEC activity grows. In particular CuI@g-C3N4_CuO showed the highest photocurrent density and the "relax time" in dark conditions has an noticeable influence on the further increase in activity.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1574-1443	1574-1451		WOS:000426935500015

A high voltage of 1.7 V is obtained in the nickel-zinc battery region and a high capacity of over 800 mAh gZn(-1) is demonstrated in the zinc-air battery region, attributed to the high pseudocapacitance and excellent activities of NiO/Ni(OH)(2) nanoporous plates and the high electrical conductivity of carbon nanotubes. In addition, the battery can be cycled steadily for over 192 times at 5 mA cm(-2) while maintaining the capacity at the energy efficiency of higher than 60%. Moreover, the discharge voltage profile and obtainable capacity remain unchanged even when the charge current density is increased by 8 times (from 2 to 16 mA cm(-2)), demonstrating excellent high-rate charge capability. The results shed light on further explorations of active materials for high-performance rechargeable hybrid batteries.

The influence of the process parameters (reaction temperature, Cu/Sc molar ratios, EG (ethylene glycol) quantity, NaOH mineralizer, reactant concentration) on the structure and morphology of CSO was studied systematically. The crystal structure, morphology, and chemical composition of these Ca doped CSO (0, 1 at%, 3 at%, and 5 at%) sheets were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). With increasing Ca dopant, the Ca doped CSO sheets become much thinner; the thickness decreased from 568 nm (CSO) to 190 nm (3 at% Ca doped CSO). Moreover, the conductivity of Ca doped CSO sheets decreased with increasing Ca dopant. The CSO powders (19.91 S m(-1)) have higher conductivity than Ca doped CSO sheets (9.89, 15.69, and 16.51 S m(-1)) at room temperature. All these CSO based samples exhibit a weak absorption ability with the absorptance around 20-40% in the visible light region (400-780 nm). The optical band gap values exhibited a blue shift with increasing Ca dopant. The calculated band gaps of Ca-doped CSO sheets are 3.88 eV, 3.91 eV, 3.90 eV and 3.93 eV, respectively. This result indicates that all these CSO based samples have potential applications as p-type transparent materials in optoelectronic devices, owing to their comparable optical transmittance in the UV-vis region.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000634382500001	33881084

This work reports the assembling fabrication of synergetic photocatalytic Au/TiO2/RGO nanostructures by utilizing the reduced graphene oxide (RGO) as substrate material and efficient separator for electrons and holes. The Au/TiO2 nanostructures with a approximate to 7 nm TiO2 particles size are dispersed uniformly on RGO nanosheets. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy verifies that Au/TiO2/RGO nanocomposites show strong absorption of visible light. The degradation efficiency after 1 h for hydroquinone under visible light and UV light is approximate to 77% and approximate to 90%, respectively. Under visible light, the calculated apparent rates (k) of the Au/TiO2/RGO nanocomposites are 0.0112 and 0.0174 min(-1) for decomposition of methylene blue and hydroquinone. That are five times greater than that of bare TiO2. The high photocatalytic activity is mainly attributed to the synergy between RGO and Au/TiO2 nanostructure. The strategy of composite nanostructures assembling on RGO is ensured to have a great practicable potential for the designing of high efficient multielement composite nanoparticles catalysts.									22	3	0	0	4	0	23			0934-0866	1521-4117		WOS:000398089100010

Synthesis by sol-gel process, structural and optical properties of nanoparticles of zinc oxide doped vanadium								SUPERLATTICES AND MICROSTRUCTURES				51	6			942	951		10.1016/j.spmi.2012.03.013				JUN 2012	2012	We report the elaboration of vanadium-doped ZnO nanoparticles prepared by a sol-gel processing technique. In our approach, the water for hydrolysis was slowly released by esterification reaction followed by a supercritical drying in ethyl alcohol. Vanadium doping concentration of 10 at.% has been investigated. After treatment in air at different temperatures, the obtained nanopowder was characterised by various techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and photoluminescence (PL). Analysis by scanning electron microscopy at high resolution shows that the grain size increases with increasing temperature. Thus, in the case of thermal treatment at 500 degrees C in air, the powder with an average particle size of 25 nm shows a strong luminescence band in the visible range. The intensity and energy position of the obtained PL band depends on the temperature measurement increase. The mechanism of this emission band is discussed. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Four protons are released during one turnover of the water oxidation cycle (S-state cycle), implying thermodynamic limitations at low pH. For proton concentrations ranging from 1 nM (pH 9) to 1 mM (pH 3), we have characterized the low-pH limitations using a new experimental approach: a specific pH-jump protocol combined with time-resolved measurement of the delayed chlorophyll fluorescence after nanosecond flash excitation. Effective pK values were determined for low-pH inhibition of the light-induced S-state transitions: pK(1) = 3.3 +/- 0.3, pK(2) = 3.5 +/- 0.2, and pK(3) approximate to pK(4) = 4.6 +/- 0.2. Alkaline inhibition was not observed. An extension of the classical Kok model facilitated assignment of these four pK values to specific deprotonation steps in the reaction cycle. Our results provide important support to the extended S-state cycle model and criteria needed for assessment of quantum chemical calculations of the mechanism of water oxidation. They also imply that, in intact organisms, the pH in the lumen compartment can hardly drop below 5, thereby limiting the Delta pH contribution to the driving force of ATP synthesis.									33	1	0	0	23	0	34			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000290585200082	21464129

Layered double hydroxide (LDH)-based photocatalysts have emerged as one of the most promising candidates to replace TiO2-based photocatalysts for these reactions(,) owing to their unique layered structure, compositional flexibility, controllable particle size, low manufacturing cost and ease of synthesis. By introducing defects into LDH materials through the control of their size to the nanoscale, the atomic structure, surface defect concentration, and electronic and optical characteristics of LDH materials can be strategically engineered for particular applications. Furthermore, through the use of advanced characterization techniques such as X-ray absorption fine structure, positron annihilation spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron spin resonance, density-functional theory calculations, and photocatalytic tests, structure-activity relationships can be established and used in the rational design of high-performance LDH-based photocatalysts for efficient solar energy capture. LDHs thus represent a versatile platform for semiconductor photocatalyst development with application potential across the energy sector.									534	47	0	0	30	0	540			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000373149700006

It has been demonstrated that groundwaters are characterised by a Ca-Mg-SO4 water type. Geochemical pattern is mainly controlled by the dissolution of halite, gypsum and/or anhydrite as well as by the incongruent dissolution of dolomite. delta O-18 and delta H-2 values are much lower than the isotopic signature of regional precipitation and fall close to the meteoric water lines, indicating that groundwaters have not been significantly affected by evaporation or mineral-water reactions. The distribution of stable and radiogenic isotopes (delta O-18, delta H-2, delta C-13 and C-14) within the aquifer levels suggests that the deep confined aquifer receives a significant modern recharge at higher altitudes, while, the shallow unconfined aquifer has been mainly recharged under cooler paleoclimatic condition, likely during Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene humid periods. However, waters from the intermediate confined/unconfined aquifer have composite isotopic signatures, highlighting that they are derived from a mixture of the two first end-members.									31	0	0	0	9	0	32			1866-6280	1866-6299		WOS:000292043100017

Community compositions of autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). DGGE results showed that a relatively stable bacterial community composed of heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria formed in the bioreactor by the end of experiment, which ensured 92-100% sulfide removal efficiencies. Furthermore, autotrophic genera of Thiobacillus and Thiomonas, as well as those of the heterotrophic genus of Acinetobacter survived and exhibited high sulfide oxidation activity under all three operational conditions. Different special genera were also observed under each operational condition, such as the halophilic genus of Nesterenkonia. In addition, a new genus of sulfide oxidation bacteria was found in the bioreactor, which had the ability to synthesize cytoplasm from organic compounds. These genera have wide applications for the treatment of sulfide in hydrocarbon wastewater. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A conventional solid oxide cell based on Ni supporting cathode, thin yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte, yttria-doped ceria interlayer, and strontium-doped lanthanum cobaltite and ferrite-based perovskite anode (Ni-YSZ/YSZ/YDC/LSPC) was used for the reduction of CO2 and water to syngas. This process was assisted by H-2 added to the reactant in various amounts to maintain the Ni sites in a metallic state. This was necessary to favour CO2 reaction and to avoid ohmic constraints that may derive from the occurrence of Ni re oxidation as consequence of the presence of oxidising species like CO2 and water. The outlet gas was analysed by gas chromatography. The presence of CO and CH4 beside CO2 and H-2 was detected in the outlet stream. Analysis of outlet gas composition revealed that CO was produced by both electrochemical and catalytic mechanisms. Suitable CO2 conversion was achieved using dry gas.

The chemical composition and morphological features of the synthesized materials are well characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning as well as transmission electron microscopy, respectively. Hierarchical pristine and N/S co-doped carbon materials are utilized as model candidates for electrocatalytic water reduction and supercapacitor applications. N/S co-doped hierarchical porous carbon shows better water reduction activity having a low overpotential value (similar to 152 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density) and Tafel slope (similar to 59 mV dec(-1)). Moreover, the N/S co-doped hierarchical porous carbon-based active electrode delivers a remarkable specific capacitance of similar to 307 F g(-1) (similar to 85.25 mA h g(-1)) at 0.50 A g(-1) current density, estimated from the galvanostatic charging-discharging curve. The enhanced electrocatalytic and capacitive activity of N/S co-doped hierarchical porous carbon are associated with the large concentration of surface-active sites with micropore-/mesopore-rich nanoarchitectures, improved electrical conductivity, large interlayer distance for better electrode/electrolyte interaction, and lower charge transfer resistance. The N/S co-doped hierarchical porous carbon-based electrode shows superior cycling stability and reversibility without a significant reduction in specific capacity even after 1000 cycles.									21	0	0	0	2	0	21			2398-4902			WOS:000582936800026

The electrocatalyst, which is one of the main components of the EHPC system, is critical for both the performance and applicability of the system. In this study, commercial carbon black supported Pt and Pd containing catalysts were prepared for the EHPC system by using microwave heating method. The synthesized catalysts were mono and bimetallic and were named as Pt/C, Pd/C and PtPd/C, respectively. By characterizing the prepared catalysts with ICP-MS, SEM-EDS, TEM, XRD and XPS, information about the distribution, amount, morphology and composition of metal nanoparticles on the support material was obtained. In addition, electrochemical properties of the catalysts were determined by CV analysis. The physical characterization results revealed that the catalysts were successfully synthesized by microwave method and that different ratios of metals and bimetallic could be loaded on the support material. It was also seen that the electrochemical activity of the PtPd/C bimetallic catalyst was better than the others.

Herein, by using the first-principles method, an efficient strategy was proposed to screen NOxRR multifunctional electrocatalysts, which focuses on the key protonation process of the essential NORR for the NOxRR. Taking double-atom catalysts (DACs) with transition-metal dimer (M1/M2 = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) embedded N-doped graphene as examples, we showed that the proposed strategy was effective for electrocatalyst screening, and we identified Cu-2@NG as the best one, with rather low limiting potentials of -0.36, -0.32, and -0.30 V for the NO3RR, NO2RR, and NORR, respectively. Furthermore, a simple descriptor for evaluating electrocatalytic activity was established. And the physical mechanism in terms of the electronic structures was analyzed for the Cu-2 DAC case in view of NO activation. Finally, from the screening test in some 4d and 5d late transition-metal based DACs, the proposed strategy was confirmed to be feasible to find another NOxRR multifunctional electrocatalyst. Our work provides a procedure for efficiently screening multifunctional electrocatalysts to simultaneously reduce all NOx species to synthesize NH3 and sheds light on the atomic mechanisms for NOx electroreduction as well.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000777593600001

Herein, we report the first attempt to synthesize AD FeNC materials for use as highly selective, room-temperature gas sensors. Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-HAADF-STEM), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, and Mossbauer spectroscopy characterization methods confirm the existence of atomically dispersed Fe with an FeN4 coordination. We demonstrate a room temperature, sensitive, and selective NO2 gas sensor technology using this platform, offering significant advantages over existing technology. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify that electrons are transferred to NO2 from FeN4 during NO2 adsorption. Both DFT calculations and experiments also reveal that the barrier for NO2 decomposition by AD FeNC is 0.73 eV, which is significantly lower than previously reported barriers (2.60-3.54 eV) in other materials. Such unique catalytic properties combined with a high surface affinity for NO2 molecules enable AD FeNC gas sensors to have excellent selective NO2 detection at room temperature. The method proposed here can inspire the use of AD materials to detect other gases and catalyze similar novel developments in the gas sensor industry.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000593047100050

The fast phase corresponds to the Y-Z(.) component while the slow phase corresponds to the tyrosine D radical (Y-D(.)) component. At 253 K, the t(1/2) value was similar to28.6 s for the fast phase and similar to190.7 s for the slow phase. The fast phase is attributed to the recombination of charges between Y-Z(.) and Q(A)(-). The activation energy for the reaction of Y-Z with QA- between 253 and 293 K was 48 kJ mol(-1) in CV-depleted photosystem 2 (PS2) membranes. Both the decay rate and the amplitude of the PAR -induced signal of Y-Z(.) were affected by addition of chloride anion. Change in the decay rate and the amplitude of the PAR-induced signal of Y-Z(.) was observed when other anions like Br-, I-, F, HCO3, NO3, PO43- were substituted in the Cl--depleted PS2.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0300-3604			WOS:000222901100009

Employing first-principles calculations, it is revealed that CoP and FeCoP2 present the same surface stability in the order of (101) approximate to (011) > (111) > (001) > (110) > (010) > (100). They also possess a similar Wulff equilibrium crystal shape with (101) and (011) exposing the largest surface area. From the electronic view, FeCoP2 presents improved electronic conductivity compared with CoP. From the energy view, whether FeCoP2 delivers improved electrocatalytic activity toward the ORR with respect to CoP depends on the reactive surfaces and sites. Among the 4 surfaces considered, only CoP(101), FeCoP2(101) and FeCoP2(011) delivered ORR performances theoretically when the bridge metal-metal site acts as the reactive center, which makes CoP(011) the only exception. CoP(101)-b(Co-Co) and FeCoP2(011)-b(Fe-Co) exhibit a larger thermodynamic limiting potential than FeCoP2(101)-b(Co-Co), suggesting their higher performances toward the ORR. The last step of HO* desorption as the rate-limiting step accounts for 3/4. The third step of transformation from O* to HO* as the most sluggish step accounts for 1/4. The work function, d-band center, Bader charge, and electronic localization function calculations are performed to reveal the HO adsorption nature. The present work provides fundamental insight into the effect of Fe doping into CoP, the determination of the catalyst surface and the key species adsorption nature to guide the rational design of high-performance materials.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000817750700001	35762394

The aim is to explore the use of earth-abundant cobalt species to replace precious metals for the photocatalytic reactions. The results of first-principles DFT simulation and planar-averaged differential charge density calculation reveal that at the CoS2/CdS interface, CoS2 has zero band gap which is a class nature of precious metals, and functions as electron trap to enhance the transfer of hot electrons from CdS to CoS2. Owing to the merits of efficient charge separation, high exposure of active sites as well as large surface area, the CoS2/CdS composites exhibit outstanding photocatalytic activity in H-2 production under visible light (similar to 58 mmol.g(-1) h(-1)), which is about 19 times that of CdS nanorods alone and 3 times that of 1 wt%Pt/CdS under the same conditions.									40	2	0	0	1	0	41			0926-860X	1873-3875		WOS:000496835900010

Water-splitting systems often include semiconductor photoanodes, such as n-Fe2O3 and n-BiVO4, which use photogenerated holes to oxidize water. These photoanodes often exhibit improved performance when coated with metal-oxide/(oxy)hydroxide overlayers that are catalytic for the water-oxidation reaction. The mechanism for this improvement, however, remains a controversial topic. This is, in part, due to a lack of experimental techniques that are able to directly track the flow of photogenerated holes in such multicomponent systems. In this Perspective, we illustrate how this issue can be addressed by using a second working electrode to make direct current/voltage measurements on the catalytic overlayer during operation in a photoelectrochemical cell. We discuss examples where the second working electrode is a thin metallic film deposited on the catalyst layer, as well as where it is the tip of a conducting atomic-force-microscopy probe. In applying these techniques to multiple semiconductors (Fe2O3, BiVO4, Si) paired with various metal-(oxy)hydroxide overlayers (e.g., Ni(Fe)OxHy and CoOxHy)) we found in all cases investigated that the overlayers collect photogenerated holes from the semiconductor, charging to potentials sufficient to drive water oxidation. The overlayers studied thus form charge-separating heterojunctions with the semiconductor as well as serve as water-oxidation catalysts.									97	8	0	0	5	0	97			0002-7863			WOS:000457817100001	30537811

Although rechargeable alka-line aqueous ZABs hold a considerable position in current research reports, their practical large-scale adoption is still obstructed by poor resistivity and cyclability. The bifunctional electrocatalyst in the air electrode appears to be the controlling factor of the efficiency of the air-cell, thus special effort has been invested into discovering effective and low-cost alternatives. Transition metal oxides have invariably been considered as competent ORR and OER electrocatalysts for other energy applications. However, a vast progress in testing of such nano struc-tured catalysts in experimental aqueous alkaline ZABs has been detected in the last years, hence the scope of this article is to give a detailed summary of the electrochemical properties and performance of these transition metal oxide -based materials, in order to provide fertile ground for further performance-oriented electrocatalysts' exploration. In the following sections, after defining certain fundamental operational aspects and challenges of the zinc air cell, special emphasis is devoted to broadened examination of recent advances in simple metal oxide, spinel oxide and perovskite oxide -based nanomaterials and nanohybrids applied as bifunctional electrocatalysts in rechargeable liquid alkaline ZAB configurations.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1364-0321	1879-0690		WOS:000784449100004

In this work, a rapid one-step aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) method is employed to synthesize amorphous and highly active cobalt-vanadium mixed oxide catalysts (CoVOx) directly over fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates. Morphological and structural characterizations made by field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques revealed the formation of pure-phase amorphous films with a gradual variation of topography as a function of deposition time. Of these films, the most active film (CoVOx-20) was obtained in 20 min deposition, showing a spongy networking of interwoven nanofibers with a homogeneous distribution of 3-4 nm pores, achieving an overpotential of 308 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) current density. A much higher current density of 175 mA/cm(2) could be achieved just at 380 mV of overpotential with Tafel slope as low as 62 mV/dec for this whole range while exhibiting long-term stability. Mass activity, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data, and the estimation of electrochemically active surface area all endorsed this high catalytic performance of CoVOx-20, which is unprecedented for a low-cost, upscalable, and relatively less conductive substrate such as FTO used here. Our findings, thus, not only highlight the benefits of using AACVD in preparing two-dimensional amorphous catalysts but also prove the high efficiency of CoVOx materials thus obtained, as outlined in a plausible reaction mechanism.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			2470-1343			WOS:000482176800155	31460388

Furthermore, the NCC undergoes a surface modification through SOCl2 chlorination and ethylenediamine (EDA) passivation, which generates graphitized aminated cellulose doped with nitrogen (NCC-EDA). This product, due to the coordination and dispersion effects of the functional groups (e.g., amido group) on its surface, is in turn used to coat Cu2O nanoparticles derived from the insitu reduction of CuCl2 center dot 2H(2)O, which leads to a composite photocatalyst Cu2O/NCC-EDA with relatively high catalytic activity. Besides the structural characterization, the present study also examines the characteristics of CH3OH prepared by visible-light-based photocatalytic reduction of CO2/H2O. The results indicate that the prepared Cu2O/NCC-EDA are spherical particles with a diameter of approximately 50 nm, which are in possession of a tree-structured rough shell capable of absorbing an increased amount of CO2. Under the radiation of visible light, the Cu2O in the prepared product is activated, yielding photoelectron-hole pairs. Driven by the nitrogen in the carrier, the formed photoelectron-hole pairs are subject to an efficient separation, and are thereby consumed by the oxidation-reduction reaction. As a result, a high activity for the photocatalyzed reduction of CO2 is obtained.									9	1	0	0	2	0	10			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000435271700019

Here, we report a convenient dissolve-regrowth method for synthesizing graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with a large surface area and nitrogen vacancies by HCl treatment. XRD, N(2)adsorption, SEM, TEM, UV-Vis spectroscopy, EPR, N-2-TPD, Photoluminescence and Photocurrent were used to characterize the prepared catalysts. The results indicate that HCl treatment does not influence the crystal phase of g-C3N4 but change the morphology and optical property, leading to the smaller particle size, larger surface area and increased bang gap energy. It is deduced by N-2-TPD, Photoluminescence, Photocurrent and DFT simulations that the nitrogen vacancies formed by the HCl treatment not only serve as active sites to adsorb and activate N-2 molecules but also promote interfacial charge transfer from g-C(3)N(4)to N-2 molecules. The HCl treated g-C3N4 catalyst exhibits outstanding nitrogen photofixation ability under visible light, which is 13.4-fold higher than that of bulk g-C3N4 without nitrogen vacancy. The possible reaction mechanism is proposed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									47	8	0	0	5	0	51			0022-3697	1879-2553		WOS:000385601100007

In this study, thermally activated graphite felt (TGF) is decorated with Co3O4 nanostructure by a low-temperature hydrothermal method. The functional groups on the TGF are believed to nucleate the Co3O4 particles establishing a covalent bridging between them. The bridge improves the electron tunnelling across the electrolyte/electrolyte interface, reducing the overpotential of vanadium redox reactions. The covalent bridge, coupled with the enhanced surface area of the nanostructured-Co3O4 coated TGF (TGF/Co-100-12), are responsible for improved VO2+/VO2+ and V3+/V2+ redox kinetics in VRFB. A 25 cm(2) VRFB employing TGF/Co-100-12 electrodes, compared to TGF, enhances the specific capacity from similar to 38 Ah l(-1) to similar to 45 Ah l(-1) and energy efficiency (EE) from 81 to 87.6% at 100 mA cm(-2) and its capacity retention (after 50 cycles) is similar to 100% higher than that of TGF based VRFB. Besides, a two-cell stack is demonstrated with an EE of 84% and 89% of initial capacity even after 50 cycles, and 3% loss in EE vis-a-vis single cell is mainly due to the additional contact resistance arising out of coupling the cells.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000595765400001

The nitrogen defects in g-C3N4 were confirmed by EA, EPR, XPS and EDS. The extra electrons in nitrogen-deficient sites can easily capture photogenerated holes and reduce the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. With appropriate amount of nitrogen defects, FH-g-C(3)N(4)possesses the best photocatalytic activity which is 58% higher than that of H-g-C3N4 (without nitrogen defects) and P25 (TiO2) for Cr(VI) reduction, and its hydrogen production rate is twice of the H-g-C3N4. Compared with H-g-C3N4, FH-g-C3N4 has a stronger light absorption capacity, a more negative potential of conduction band, and a stronger reduction capacity. This work could provide significant information for the simple synthesis of nitrogen-deficient g-C3N4 photocatalyst with distinct reduction performance.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			0025-5408	1873-4227		WOS:000536182700002

The complex mimics the function of the tyrosinez and chlorophyll unit P-680 in natural photosystem II (PSII). A ruthenium(II) tris(bipyridyl) complex covalently linked to a L-tyrosine ethyl ester through an amide bond was attached to the surface of nanocrystalline TiO2 via carboxylic acid groups linked to the bpy ligands. Synthesis and characterization of this complex are described. Excitation (450 nm) of the complex promotes an electron to a metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) excited state, from which the electron is injected into TiO2. The photogeneration of Ru(III) is followed by an intramolecular electron transfer from tyrosine to Ru(III), regenerating the photosensitizer Ru(II) and forming the tyrosyl radical. The tyrosyl radical is formed in less than 5 us with a yield of 15%. This rather low yield is a result of a fast back electron transfer reaction from the nanocrystalline TiO2 to the photogenerated Ru(III).									36	2	0	0	2	0	36			0020-1669			WOS:000179540200019	12444768

First, the photo-oxidation of Mn2+ on monoclinic BiVO4 is shown to be domain selective, occurring on the set of domains that is not active for the photo-reduction of Ag+. Next, the domain and orientation dependent photochemical reduction of Ag+ is investigated for two samples in the co-doped family (Bi1-0.5xNa0.5x)(V1-xMox)O-4: a monoclinic sample (x = 0.05) and a tetragonal sample (x = 0.175). Like BiVO4, the x = 0.05 sample has ferroelastic domains that exhibit contrast in piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and exhibit domain specific reactivity. The x = 0.175 sample has no domains, no PFM contrast, and uniform grain reactivity. The orientation dependence of Ag+ reduction is similar for the two samples, with surfaces near (001) being more active than others. For any given orientation, however, the monoclinic sample is quantitatively more active than the same orientation in the tetragonal sample. These collected results are consistent with the hypothesis that monoclinic-structured BiVO4 ceramics have enhanced photochemical activity owing to ferroelastic domain-selective reactivity, which allows for local separation of photogenerated carriers and redox reactions.									17	0	0	0	0	0	16			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000371077300021

Electrochemical measurements showed that the incorporation of calcium into manganese oxide promotes water oxidation at a very low energy cost, similar to that observed in natural photosystem II (PSII). The low energy cost is due to the involvement of the Mn-IV=O species in the catalysis as compared to the Mn-V=O species that has been previously detected in calcium-free alpha-Mn2O3. Moreover, the FTO/EMI CaMn-oxide electro-catalyst showed unprecedentedly high activity (TOF approximate to 29.8 s(-1) at eta = 0.57 V) and robustness (tested for 40 h) for water oxidation in a neutral potassium phosphate (KPi) buffer solution (0.1 M, pH 7.0).

However, the recent surge in two-dimensional materials science is accompanied by equally great challenges, such as defect engineering in large-scale sample synthesis. It is necessary to elucidate the effect of structural defects on the electronic properties in order to develop an application-specific strategy for defect engineering. Here, two aspects of the existing knowledge of native defects in two-dimensional crystals are reviewed. One is the point defects emerging in graphene and hexagonal boron nitride, as probed by atomically resolved electron microscopy, and their local electronic properties, as measured by single-atom electron energy-loss spectroscopy. The other will focus on the point defects in TMDs and their influence on the electronic structure, photoluminescence, and electric transport properties. This review of atomic defects in twodimensional materials will offer a clear picture of the defect physics involved to demonstrate the local modulation of the electronic properties and possible benefits in potential applications in magnetism and catalysis.									147	8	0	0	10	0	149			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000398357200014	28295728

Moreover, the overall voltage to achieve a current density of 1000 mA cm(-2) in a water electrolysis cell was only 1.649 V, making IrO2 (1 : 100)450 degrees C a highly attractive catalyst for water electrolysis applications.									45	3	0	0	1	0	46			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000405387100004	28661529

During the hydrothermal reaction, the graphene nanosheets and MnOx-CeO2 nanoparticles self-assembled into 3D interconnected networks, in which the nanoparticles MnOx-CeO2 with uniform size were densely anchored onto the graphene nanosheets. Besides, the MnOx-CeO2/reduced graphene oxide (RGA) exhibited unique properties such as high specific surface area, and numerous catalytically active sites in comparison with pure MnOx-CeO2 nanoparticles. Evidences have shown that the chemical bonding between MnOx-CeO2 and GO achieved high selective catalytic reduction efficiency. The MnOx-CeO2/RGA composites displayed highly enhanced catalytic activity in comparison to bare MnOx-CeO2 nanoparticles which achieved 99% NOx conversion at 220 degrees C. This work provided a versatile approach to induce the combination of reduced graphene oxide sheets and other oxide nanoparticles, which opened up new avenues for the design and manufacture of catalysts used for low temperature SCR of NOx with NH3.									17	1	0	0	1	0	18			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000516818700044

Mechanism of Perchlorate Formation on Boron-Doped Diamond Film Anodes								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				45	24			10582	10590		10.1021/es202534w				DEC 15 2011	2011	This research investigated the mechanism of perchlorate (ClO4-) formation from chlorate (ClO3-) on boron-doped diamond (BDD) film anodes by use of a rotating disk electrode reactor. Rates of ClO4- formation were determined as functions of the electrode potential (2.29-2.70 V/standard hydrogen electrode, SHE) and temperature (10-40 degrees C). At all applied potentials and a ClO3- concentration of 1 mM, concentration. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) ClO4- production rates were zeroth-order with respect to ClO4- results indicate that ClO3- oxidation proceeds via a combination of direct electron transfer and hydroxyl radical oxidation with a measured apparent activation energy of 6.9 +/- 1.8 kJ.mol(-1) at a potential of 2.60 V/SHE. DFT simulations indicate that the ClO4- formation mechanism involves direct oxidation of ClO3- at the BDD surface to form ClO3 center dot, which becomes activationless at potentials > 0.76 V/SHE. Perchloric acid is then formed via the activationless homogeneous reaction between ClO3 center dot; and OH center dot in the diffuse layer next to the BDD surface. DFT simulations also indicate that the reduction of ClO3 center dot can occur at radical sites on the BDD surface to form ClO3- and ClO2, which limits the overall rate of ClO4- formation.									90	3	0	0	50	0	93			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000298118300045	22029642

A novel heterostructure of ultrafine FeOOH nanodots with an average size of 2.3 nm supported on CoAl-LDH nanosheets, is constructed by a facile method under ambient conditions. The as-prepared FeOOH@CoAl-LDH shows a strong interfacial interaction upon the formation of heterostructure, and is demonstrated as a highly efficient and stable electrocatalyst that demands 272 mV to attain 50 mA cm(-2) and exhibits a Tafel slope of 40 mV dec(-1). Moreover, density functional theory calculations manifest the coupling of FeOOH with CoAl-LDH can effectively decrease the energy barrier during the water oxidation process by optimizing the adsorption free energy of intermediates in the reaction pathway. The successful development of FeOOH@CoAl-LDH can shed light on the design of novel electrocatalysts that can fully take advantages of small size, heterostructure and synergistic effect.

Our systematic studies reveal that the defect content, porosity characteristic and conductivity of defective carbons can be finely tuned by manipulating the pyrolysis temperature and viscosity of precursor polymer SA, which significantly affect the ORR performance. The optimized defective porous carbon catalyst (i.e., D-PC-1( 900)) that was revealed to possess abundant ORR-active defects, large surface area of 1377 m(2)g(-1), abundant hierarchical porosity and good conductivity, exhibited very nice ORR activity and selectivity in 0.1M KOH, comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. In 0.5MH(2)SO(4), considerable ORR activity was also observed for D-PC-1(900), which is among the highest reported for defective carbons and comparable to many of N-doped carbons. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the carbon defect can create the active sites for ORR in acidic media. More importantly, in both alkaline and acidic media, D-PC-1(900) shows much better stability and methanol tolerance than those of the Pt/C catalyst. All these results demonstrate that the seaweed biomass derived defective carbon is an excellent candidate for non-precious-metal ORR catalyst in various fuel cells. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, in an effort to address these challenges, we develop a hierarchically nanostructured photoanode composed of iron-oxides; Ti-doped hematite nanorods are decorated with an undoped hematite underlayer and beta-FeOOH nano-branches. The Ti-doped hematite nanorod array is prepared by hydrothermal synthesis, and this nanostructure offers enhanced separation of photogenerated charges. The underlayer not only increases the photocurrent density but also improves the onset potential. The photocurrent further increases by the epitaxially grown b-FeOOH nano-branches on the hematite, but the onset potential is positively shifted by the b-FeOOH due to increasing flat-band potential. The analyses of the photocurrent transients and electrochemical impedance spectra reveal that beta-FeOOH improves the photocurrent by decreasing the resistance to charge transfer through the anode/electrolyte. This study demonstrates a new possibility for improving the efficiency of a hematite photoanode with the interface of other iron-oxides.									63	4	0	0	1	0	65			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000330048400037

Both products are high-value chemicals and in gas-liquid two phases, which avoid the trouble of separation. XRD, N-2 adsorption, UV-Vis, SEM, TEM, PL, XPS and ESR were used to characterize the as-prepared catalysts. The CB and VB of as-prepared catalysts can be adjusted from -1.22 V and + 1.46 V for g-C3N4 to - 0.06 V and + 2.42 V for NaCN [9] by controlling the Na+ concentration. The reaction result indicates that a moderate band position is significantly important for effective photocatalytic water splitting to simultaneously produce H-2 and H2O2. After loading of Pt to promote the electron-hole separation efficiency, Pt-NaCN [6] displays the optimal H-2 and H2O2 production abilities of 900 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1) and 880 mu mol.g(-1), simultaneously.

One intuitively feels that this question goes beyond the particular nature of the biological molecules and should relate to general physical principles. The pre-eminent physicist Ludwig Boltzmann early envisioned life as a struggle for entropy, in concordance with the subsequent principle of self-organization out of equilibrium. Re-examination of elementary steady state biochemical systems from a statistical perspective supports this view and shows that sigmoidal responses arising from microstates elimination, are sufficient to explain innermost characteristics of life, including its capacity to convert random molecular interactions into accurate biological reactions. A primary operating strategy to achieve this goal is the introduction of time-irreversible transitions in molecular state conversion cycles by injection of free energy, which confers decisional capacity to single macromolecules. Selected examples from various fields of molecular biology such as enzymology and gene expression, are provided to show that these non-equilibrium steady state mechanisms remain important in contemporary biochemical systems. But in addition, information archiving allowed the emergence of the time-reversible counterparts of these mechanisms, mediated by evolutionary pre-organized macromolecular complexes capable of generating discernment in a non-dissipative manner.

We tracked mechanistically relevant oxidation-state and structural changes of an amorphous Co-based catalyst film by in situ experiments combining directly synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) with electrocatalysis. Unlike a classical solid-state material, the bulk material is found to undergo chemical changes. Two redox transitions at midpoint potentials of about 1.0 V ((Co0.4Co0.6III)-Co-II <-> all-Co-III) and 1.2 V (all-Co-III <-> 4 (Co0.8Co0.2IV)-Co-III) vs. NHE at pH 7 are coupled to structural changes. These redox transitions can be induced by variation of either electric potential or pH; they are broader than predicted by a simple Nernstian model, suggesting interacting bridged cobalt ions. Tracking reaction kinetics by UV-Vis-absorption and time-resolved mass spectroscopy reveals that accumulated oxidizing equivalents facilitate dioxygen formation. On these grounds, a new framework model of catalysis in an amorphous, hydrated and volume-active oxide is proposed: Within the oxide film, cobalt ions at the margins of Co-oxo fragments undergo Co-II <-> Co-III <-> Co-IV oxidation-state changes coupled to structural modification and deprotonation of Co-oxo bridges. By the encounter of two (or more) Co-IV ions, an active site is formed at which the O-O bond-formation step can take place. The Tafel slope is determined by both the interaction between cobalt ions (width of the redox transition) and their encounter probability. Our results represent a first step toward the development of new concepts that address the solid-molecular Janus nature of the amorphous oxide. Insights and concepts described herein for the Co-based catalyst film may be of general relevance also for other amorphous oxides with water-oxidation activity.									219	3	0	0	32	1	220			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000349616900025

Their photocatalytic H2 productivities were systematically investigated and compared with corresponding single-anion Cu-X-bpy (X = Cl, Br, I). It was found that the CPs possess excellent H2 productivity even without additional photosensitizer and cocatalyst, and their activities can be significantly enhanced from 2.79 (Cu-I-bpy) to 10.04 mmol/gh (Cu-Cl/I-bpy) by simply varying the anions, mu-X-, in SBUs. Mechanistic investigations indicate that the water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption energies during water split-ting can be regulated by just varying mu-X- in SBUs, which majorly accounts for their great discrepancy in H2 productivity rather than the light harvesting, charge separation and transfer efficiency of Cu-X-bpy.

In present work, a novel and simple MOF-induced strategy is developed to construct three-dimensional actiniae-like carbon nanotube assembly (3D-CNTA) as effective and low-cost multifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting and Zn-air batteries. In this strategy, ZIF-67 is used as the precursor, which also serves as the structure inducer, and melamine is chosen as an initiator for orientated growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The resultant 3D-CNTA is assembled from a large number of one-dimensional (1D) CNTs, and it possesses superior conductivity, high specific surface area (108.12 m(2) g(-1)) and abundant hierarchically porous structure. Meanwhile, each CNT is capped with zero-dimensional (0D) synapse-like Co@N-doped carbon core-shell particles (Co@NC), and the core-shell structure could expose the catalytic active sites to the electrolyte to the most extent and meanwhile protect the Co species from corrosion in the electrolyte. The integrated effects of the above factors endow 3D-CNTA excellent multifunctional electrocatalytic performances in terms of overall water splitting and zinc-air batteries. Our work provides a guide to rational design of micro-structures of the materials to achieve their multifunctional properties.									192	14	0	0	5	0	194			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000408878200068

More importantly, two different morphologies of beta-Co(OH)(2): mesoporous nanowafers and nanohexagons were successfully obtained through one reaction. Furthermore, the special mesoporous of beta-Co(OH)(2) nanowafers and nanohexagons exhibited excellent electrochemical hydrogen storage capacities and cycling stability. The maximum capacity reached 265.9 and 215.7 mA h g(-1) at room temperature, respectively. After 70 cycles, the discharging capacities of the electrode still remain above 218.2 and 175.4 mA h g(-1), which indicates that the as-prepared mesoporous beta-Co(OH)(2) nanowafers have a strong resistance against oxidation and corrosion. These results indicates that the mesoporous beta-Co(OH)(2) nanowafers and nanohexagons may be potentially applied for electrochemical hydrogen storage.									29	1	0	0	0	0	30			1002-0071	1745-5391		WOS:000393208500007

Using a low concentration of chloride ions (0.05 mol L-1) and a low current density (5 mA cm(-2)) it was possible to produce up to 60 mg L-1 of active chlorine on a Ti/Sn0.99Ir0.01O2 anode. The feasibility of the discoloration of a textile acid azo dye, acid red 29 dye (C.I. 16570), was also investigated with in situ electrogenerated active chlorine on Ti/Sn(1-x)Ir (x) O-2 anodes. The best conditions for 100% discoloration and maximum degradation (70% TOC reduction) were found to be: NaCl pH 4, 25 mA cm(-2) and 6 h of electrolysis. It is suggested that active chlorine generation and/or powerful oxidants such as chlorine radicals and hydroxyl radicals are responsible for promoting faster dye degradation. Rate constants calculated from color decay versus time reveal a zero order reaction at dye concentrations up to 1.0 x 10(-4) mol L-1. Effects of other electrolytes, dye concentration and applied density currents also have been investigated and are discussed.									84	4	0	0	14	3	86			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000245358900007

The combined treatment of Cu2+ and SO2 significantly increased H2S formation in Verdelho wines samples that were not previously treated with either Cu2+ or SO2. The formation of H2S produced through Cu2+ mediated reactions was likely either: (a) directly through the interaction of SO2 with either Cu2+ or H2S; or (b) indirectly through the interaction of SO2 with other wine matrix compounds. To gain better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the significant increases in H2S concentration in the Verdelho samples, the interaction between Cu2+ and SO2 was studied in a model wine matrix with and without the presence of a representative thiol quenching compound (4-methylbenzoquinone, 4MBQ). In these model studies, the importance of naturally occurring wine compounds and wine additives, such as quinones, SO2, and metal ions, in modulating the formation of H2S post-bottling was demonstrated. When present in equimolar concentrations a 1:1 ratio of H2S- and SO2-catechol adducts were produced. At wine relevant concentrations, however, only SO2-adducts were produced, reinforcing that the competition reactions of sulfur nucleophiles, such as H2S and SO2, with wine matrix compounds play a critical role in modulating final H2S concentrations in wines.									19	1	0	0	13	0	20				1420-3049		WOS:000385479800111	27626394

The challenge lies in the catalyst design to enable its real-life implementation. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis and characterization of a cobalt(III) triphenylphosphine corrole complex, which contains three polyethylene glycol residues attached at the meso-phenyl groups. Electron-donation and therefore reduction of the cobalt from cobalt(III) to cobalt(I) is accompanied by removal of the axial ligand, thus resulting in a square-planar cobalt(I) complex. The cobalt(I) as an electron-rich supernucleophilic d(8)-configurated metal centre, where two electrons occupy and fill up the antibonding d(z)(2) orbital.

Besides the previously reported supporting carbon functionalization, the nanoparticle size was optimized by a diffusion-controlled growth process to control Rh2S3 monomer concentration, which reduced the average particle size from 13.2 to 5.2 nm and increased the ECSA/mass from 9.1 to 36.5 m(2)/g-Rh. The affinity issue between the surface ketone functional group and the Nafion ionomer in the catalyst ink was resolved by using the Baeyer-Villiger reaction and ester hydrolysis to convert it to the Nafion-friendly carboxylic group with no adverse effect on the precipitated catalysts. The H-2-Br-2 fuel cell tests confirmed that the high mass transfer issue observed with the RhxSy catalysts on ketone-dominated carbon substrate was resolved with the new catalysts, validating the hypothesis that the low affinity to Nafion polymer of the surface ketone group was the cause for the formation of thick Nafion polymer layer on the catalyst surface and high mass transportation resistance. Using the new catalyst, the discharge performance of the H-2-Br-2 fuel cell improved by 5.6 times (0.15 vs. 0.027 A/cm(2) at 0.2 V below OCV) over that of the fuel cell with the RhxSy/untreated carbon catalyst.

J	Yu, Yixuan; Zhao, Yingping; Wang, Haonan; Tao, Ping; Zhang, Xinmin; Shao, Mihua; Sun, Tianjun								Implications of hydrogen peroxide on bromate depression during seawater ozonation								CHEMOSPHERE				280						130669	10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.130669		APR 2021		OCT 2021	2021	The presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in ozonation process can resist the formation of carcinogenic bromate (BrO3) efficiently, and the bromate depression is closely related with background water qualities, especially in high bromide-containing seawater. In this study, the freshwater and seawater were selected to investigate the effects of H2O2 on ozone (O-3) decomposition kinetics, bromide transformation and bromate depression, and the evolutions of BrO3 under different scavengers were explored to speculate the primary bromate formation pathways. The results showed that the initial O-3 half-live period (t(1)(/2)-O-3) in seawater was only one-sixth of that in freshwater, and its attenuation rate increased analogously with the increase of H2O2 concentration in both freshwater and seawater. The H2O2 could promote the formation of BrO3 via hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) based bromate pathways, nevertheless higher concentration of H2O2 facilitated the reduction of HOBr/OBr back to Br, resulting in 87.0% and 73.2% of BrO3 retardment in freshwater and seawater, respectively. The suppression ratios of BrO3 were up to 48.4% and 35.3% in freshwater with the addition of center dot OH and center dot O-2 scavengers, and the corresponding depressions in seawater decreased to 35.3% and 12.7%, indicating that center dot OH was dominant on bromate formation when the concentration of residual ozone was adequate to generate some bromine intermediates, meanwhile H2O2 and center dot O-2 functioned as the key reductants for bromate depression. Based on these results, the Br transformation mechanisms via O-3, center dot OH, H2O2, and center dot O-2 reactions were speculated, and the feasibility of H2O2 -ozonation was verified for the treatment of high Br-containing seawater.

In this work, unique lead-free 0.7BiFeO(3)-0.3BaTiO(3) (BF-BT) nanoparticles with tuned band structure were synthesized by the hydrothermal method for use as piezoelectric catalysts to generate hydrogen by splitting water; a high production rate of 1.322 mmol/g was achieved in 1 h, which is 10 times higher than the production rate of pure BiFeO3. Of particular interest, BF-BT particles attached to nickel mesh have the ability to degrade rhodamine B in flowing water, demonstrating their potential to treat polluted water by anchoring BF-BT in drains. Finally, we propose novel insight on the piezocatalytic mechanism, which is based on the internal electric field (the sum of the depolarization field and the screening charge field) that drives electron/hole separation and movement.									15	1	0	0	1	0	16			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000629054100036	33634697

Herein, a self-catalytically grafted growth approach is developed to construct carbon hybrid with three-dimensional (3D) nano-forest architecture via controlled pyrolysis of metal polymer nanofiber precursor and melamine. The metal-polymer nanofibers act as the matrix, and melamine is used as the initiator for orientated growth of one-dimensional (1D) N-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) on carbon nanofibers. The as-prepared CoFe-N-CNTs/CNFs-900 possesses unique structure and component advantages in terms of 3D structure, special synapse-like structure, porous feature, high-level N doping and bimetallic active components, which endow the material with structural stability, high mass/electron transport ability and large active sur-/interfaces. Benefiting from the integrated effects of all the above factors, CoFe-N-CNTs/CNFs were successfully applied to overall water splitting and Zn-air batteries. It is believed that this integrated design methodology can be extended to prepare other M-N-C materials for energy-related electrochemical reactions.

The main challenge of this technique is the difficulty in realizing sustainable H-2 production (SHP) because of the poor stability of most electrode catalysts, especially on the anode side, under strongly acidic and highly polarized electrochemical environments, which leads to surface corrosion and performance degradation. Research efforts focused on tuning the atomic/nano structures of catalysts have been made to address this stability issue, with only limited effectiveness because of inevitable catalyst degradation. A systems approach considering reaction types and system configurations/operations may provide innovative viewpoints and strategies for SHP, although these aspects have been overlooked thus far. This review provides an overview of acidified water electrolysis for systematic investigations of these aspects to achieve SHP. First, the fundamental principles of SHP are discussed. Then, recent advances on design of stable electrode materials are examined, and several new strategies for SHP are proposed, including fabrication of symmetrical heterogeneous electrolysis system and fluid homogeneous electrolysis system, as well as decoupling/hybrid-governed sustainability. Finally, remaining challenges and corresponding opportunities are outlined to stimulate endeavors toward the development of advanced acidified water electrolysis techniques for SHP.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2				2198-3844		WOS:000741352100001	35018743

The kinetics were independent of temperature in the studied range from 4.2 to 50 K and were not affected by exchange of H2O for D2O, consistent with single-step electron tunneling over the distance of similar to 32 angstrom without any repopulation through Boltzmann equilibration of intermediates lying higher in energy. In PsbA1-PSII, the charge recombinations in the radical pairs S(n)Tyr(Z)(center dot)Q(A)(-center dot) (k(et) = 3.4 x 10(-3) s(-1) for S-1) were slower than in PsbA3-PSII despite an expected lower driving force owing to a downshifted E-m(Q(A)/Q(A)(-center dot)) in PsbA1-PSII. Conversely, the reaction was slower in the presence of S-2 than in the presence of SI, despite an expected larger driving force due to an upshifted E-m(Tyr(Z)(center dot)/Tyr(Z)) in S-2. These observations indicate that the charge recombination occurs in the Marcus inverted region. Assuming that the driving force of the reaction (-Delta G(0) approximate to 1.2 eV at room temperature for S-1) does not vary strongly with temperature, the data indicate an optimal electron transfer rate (for a hypothetical -Delta G(0) = lambda) substantially faster than would be predicted from extrapolation of room temperature intraprotein ET rates over shorter distances. Possible origins of this deviation are discussed, including a possible enhancement of the electronic coupling of Tyr(Z)(center dot) and Q(A)(-center dot). by aromatic cofactors located in between. Observed similar S(1)Tyrz(center dot)Q(A)(-center dot) charge recombinations in PsbA2-PSII and PsbA3-PSII predict that E-m(Q(A)/Q(A)(-center dot)) in PsbA2-PSII is similar to that in PsbA3-PSII.									16	0	0	0	9	0	16			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000317032300005	23448315	
J	Isaksson, Caroline				Vazquez-Dominguez, Guillermo GVD/L-7818-2014				Urbanization, oxidative stress and inflammation: a question of evolving, acclimatizing or coping with urban environmental stress								FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY				29	7	SI		913	923		10.1111/1365-2435.12477				JUL 2015	2015	To estimate the impact of urbanization on wild animals, it is important to know how different species, populations and/or individuals deal with and respond to environmental stress. Are more urbanized species adapted to their environment, or do individuals acclimatize over the course of their life? Alternatively, do they simply cope at the expense of other functions? These are three key processes that I will address using two important physiological responses as case traits, namely oxidative stress and inflammation, - which are known to be under genetic control as well as showing great plasticity. Oxidative stress is a state of more reactive oxidants than antioxidants, which may cause tissue damage linked to disease and senescence. Inflammation, on the other hand, is the response of vascular tissues to harmful stimuli. However, under progressive stimuli, inflammation may also cause tissue destruction and pathology. Although patterns and strengths of effects are not always clear cut, the often interconnected oxidative stress and inflammation have the potential to be severely affected by urban stressors, thereby mechanistically linking ecology to fitness. Here I discuss five major urban stressors: chemical, noise and artificial night light pollution, disease and diet, and how their individual and combinatory effects may affect these two physiological responses. To start to disentangle whether physiological responses are a question of evolving, acclimatizing or coping with the urban environment, population genetics along with regulatory mechanisms of gene expression will shed light on the costs' of urban life and help to understand why some species or genotypes thrive, while others are absent, in urban areas. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been successful for explaining local adaptation and tolerance towards acute toxic substances. However, for multiple stressors acting in concert, at low chronic exposure, investigations of epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression may be more illuminating. Here I review the pathways by which genetic and epigenetic mechanisms can affect oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in urban environments, thereby affecting overall fitness. By doing so, I identify the major outstanding gaps of knowledge in the interfaces between ecology, toxicology, evolutionary and molecular biology to inform future studies of urban wildlife.									111	1	0	0	100	0	114			0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000357738300006

The obtained CeO2(x)/CNS composites (x = 8.4, 9.5 and 10.4 wt%) with different CeO2 contents were characterized by the XRD, FT-IR, XPS, TEM, BET, DRS and PL analyses. The TEM images displayed a nonporous and platelet-like morphology for pure CNS but a nanoporous structure with numerous uniform pore sizes of similar to 40 nm for the CeO2(9.5)/CNS composite. The XRD phase structures and TEM morphologies confirmed that structural evolution trend and stacking degree of CNS were disrupted in precense of the CeO2 nanoparticles. The optimized photocatalyst, i.e. CeO2(9.5)/CNS nanocomposite, exhibited the highest visible light photocatalytic activity (91.4% after 150 min) with a reaction rate constant of 0.0152 min(-1) toward methylene blue (MB) degradation which was greater compared with the individual CNS (0.0044 min(-1)) and CeO2 (0.0031 min(-1)) photocatalysts. This enhanced photocatalytic performance was originated from heterojunctions formed between CeO2 and CNS that improved the effective charge transfer through interfacial interactions between both components. The heterojunction prepared displayed excellent stability for the photocatalytic activity under the optimized conditions including catalyst dosage 0.08 g, initial dye concentration 7 mg/L and irradiation time 150 min which was obtained using response surface methodology (RSM). The trapping experiments using isopropanol, benzoquinone and ethylenediaminetetraacetic as the center dot OH, center dot O-2(-) and h(+) scavengers, respectively, verified that the center dot OH and center dot O-2(-) as major species directly attacked onto the MB molecules while h(+) showed a negligible role. Finally, it could be stated that simultaneous doping of both sulfur and CeO2 within the g-C3N4 structure using a simple one-pot synthetic process produced very active photocatalysts illustrating their potential for practical applications in industrial water treatment purposes.

J	Kimura, Y; Hasegawa, K; Ono, T								Characteristic changes of the S-2/S-1 difference FTIR spectrum induced by Ca2+ depletion and metal cation substitution in the photosynthetic oxygen-evolving complex								BIOCHEMISTRY				41	18			5844	5853		10.1021/bi016093u				MAY 7 2002	2002	Effects of Ca2+ depletion and substitution with other metal cations on the structure of, the protein matrices of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) and their corresponding changes upon the S-1 to S-2 transition were examined using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Ca2+ depletion and further supplementation with Li+, Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, or Sr2+ did not significantly affect the typical vibrational features in the double difference S-2/S-1 spectrum, including the symmetric [1365(+)/1404(-) cm(-1)] and the asymmetric [1587(+)/1566(-) cm(-1)] stretching modes of the carboxylate ligand and the amide I and II modes of the backbone polypeptides. On the other hand. supplementation with K+, Rb+, Cs+, or Ba2+ significantly modified the S-2/S-1 spectrum, in which the carboxylate modes disappeared and the amide I and II modes were modified. Results indicate that the binding of metal cations that have ionic radii larger than that of Ca2+ to the Ca2+ site induces perturbations in the protein matrices in the vicinity of the Mn cluster to interrupt the characteristic structural and/or conformational changes upon the oxidation of the Mn cluster accompanied with the S-1 to S-2 transition. The spectrum was also altered by the supplementation of Cd2+, which has an ionic radius comparable to that of Ca2+. A single-pulse-induced S-2/S-1 difference spectrum revealed that bands that have been assigned to the vibrational modes for the Y-Z tyrosine and the histidine ligand for the Mn cluster were not induced in the K+-supplemented membranes, although the histidine band is likely to be preserved in the Ca2+-depleted membranes. The Y-Z band was considerably small in the double difference S-2/S-1 spectrum in the Ca2+-depleted and the cation-substituted membranes but distinctively present in the Sr2+ or Ca2+-replenished membranes. Furthermore, cation Supplementation induced several new bands that disappeared following the Ca2+ replenishment. These results suggest that the proper organization of the hydrogen bond network within OEC for the water oxidation chemistry requires the Ca2+ ion and indicate that the role of Ca2+ is not purely structurally defined by the physical properties of the ion, such as valence and ionic radius. On the basis of these and other findings, we propose that Ca2+ is necessary for the formation of the hydrogen bond network that is involved in the reaction step of water oxidation.									39	1	0	0	27	0	39			0006-2960			WOS:000175365300016	11980488

However, recent studies attempting to constrain sulfide oxidation rates, atmospheric O-2 sinks, and trace metal delivery to seawater under Archean conditions are limited by the need to extrapolate from experimental pyrite oxidation kinetics determined at much higher O-2 levels. Extrapolation of those data sets to Archean levels of O-2 (<10(-5) present atmospheric level or PAL prior to 2.4 Ga) leads to more than an order of magnitude uncertainty in sulfide mineral oxidation rates, hampering efforts to quantify oxidative weathering under early Earth conditions.To quantify sulfide oxidation kinetics at low pO(2), we conducted aqueous pyrite and molybdenite oxidation experiments at similar to 2-1200 nM dissolved O-2 and pH values 1.83, 5.08, and 8.58. Our experimental approach used LUMOS O-2 sensors to extend the pO(2) range explored by oxidation experiments down to 10(-5) PAL pO(2), the limit of the sensors, which is up to three orders of magnitude lower than the pO(2) range explored in previous work.From these experiments, we use 28 independent rate measurements to derive a new rate law for the oxidation of pyrite as a function of pO(2):r(pyrite) = 10(-8.83(+/- 0.27))[O-2](0.50(+/- 0.04))[H+](-0.25(+/- 0.02))Where r(pyrite) is the rate of oxidation in mol/m(2) sec, and the activities of dissolved [O-2] and [H+] are in (mol/L). Our results most closely match the previous rate law presented by Williamson and Rimstidt (1994), but indicate a stronger pH dependence than previous studies. We also present the first kinetic rate law for molybdenite oxidation at low O-2, based on 13 independent rate measurements:r(molybdenite) = 10(-8.3(+/- 2.3))[O-2](0.5(+/- 0.3))Where r(molybdenite) is the rate of oxidation in mol/m(2) sec, and the activity of dissolved [O-2] is in (mol/L). We find molybdenite oxidation to be nearly as rapid as pyrite oxidation even at low concentrations of dissolved O-2 (equivalent to <10(-5) PAL pO(2)), in contrast to previous work which argued for a threshold effect for molybdenite oxidation. Both pyrite and molybdenite oxidation kinetics exhibit a constant half-order dependence on dissolved O-2 down to nanomolar levels of O-2. We show that this behavior is best explained by a reaction mechanism in which O-2 undergoes dissociative adsorption to the sulfide mineral surface. This mechanism helps to resolve major uncertainties regarding the reaction mechanism of O-2 with pyrite and molybdenite mineral surfaces and provides a strong theoretical basis for the robust extrapolation of present results to higher and lower O-2 concentrations.

We recently identified a novel mechanism for the control of CSF-1 activity in teleost fish, through the production of an inhibitory soluble form of the CSF-1 receptor (sCSF-1R). Primary goldfish kidney macrophages selectively expressed sCSF-1R during the senescence phase, which corresponds to a defined stage of in vitro culture development where inhibition of macrophage proliferation and apoptotic cell death are prominent. In contrast, primary macrophage cultures undergoing active proliferation displayed low levels of sCSF-1R expression. Addition of purified recombinant sCSF-1R to developing primary macrophage cultures leads to a dose-dependent decrease in macrophage proliferation and inhibits macrophage antimicrobial functions including chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and production of reactive oxygen intermediates. Using a goldfish in vivo model of self-resolving peritonitis, we found that sCSF-1R plays a role in the inhibition of inflammation, following an initial acute phase of antimicrobial responses within an inflammatory site. Soluble CSF-1R inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine production, inhibits leukocyte recruitment to the inflammatory site and decreases ROS production in a dose-dependent manner. This sCSF-1R-dependent regulation of inflammation appears to be an elegant mechanism for the control of macrophage numbers at inflammatory sites of lower vertebrates. Overall, our results provide new insights into the evolutionary origins of the CSF-1 immune regulatory axis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, its development is restricted by two main issues: (i) a lack of breakthrough catalysts working under visible light (42-43% of sunlight in energy) as well as ambiguous property-activity relationships and (ii) unclear fundamental reasons underlying its high yield of hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot). In this Account, we summarize our substantial contributions to solving these issues, including (i) new-generation graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) catalysts with excellent performance for photocatalytic ozonation under visible light, (ii) mechanisms of charge carrier transfer and reactive oxygen species (ROS) evolution, (iii) property-activity relationships, and (iv) chemical and working stabilities of g-C3N4 catalysts. On this basis, the principles/directions for future catalyst design/optimization are discussed, and a new concept of integrating solar photocatalytic ozonation with catalytic ozonation in one plant for continuous treatment of wastewater regardless of sunlight availability is proposed.The story starts from our finding that bulk/nanosheet/nanoporous g-C3N4 triggers a strong synergy between visible light (vis) and ozone, causing efficient mineralization of a wide variety of organic pollutants. Taking bulk g-C3N4 as an example, photocatalytic ozonation (vis/O-3/g-C3N4) causes the mineralization of oxalic acid (a model pollutant) at a rate 95.8 times higher than the sum of photocatalytic oxidation (vis/O-2/g-C3N4) and ozonation. To unravel this synergism, we developed a method based on in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy coupled with an online spin trapping technique for monitoring under realistic aqueous conditions the generation and transfer of photoinduced charge carriers and their reaction with dissolved O-3/O-2 to form ROS. The presence of only 2.1 mol % O-3 in the inlet O-2 gas stream can trap 1-2 times more conduction band electrons than pure O-2 and shifts the reaction pathway from inefficient three-electron reduction of O-2 (O-2 -> O-center dot(2)- -> HO2 center dot -> H2O2 -> (OH)-O-center dot) to more efficient one-electron reduction of O-3 (O-3 -> O-center dot(3) -> HO3 -> (OH)-O-center dot), thereby increasing the yield of 'OH by a factor of 17. Next, we confirmed band structure as a decisive factor for catalytic performance and established a new concept for resolving this relationship, involving "the number of reactive charge carriers". An optimum balance between the number and reducing ability of photoinduced electrons, which depends on the interplay between the band gap and the conduction band edge potential, is a key property for highly active g-C3N4 catalysts. Furthermore, we demonstrated that g-C3N4 is chemically stable toward O-3 and O-center dot(2)- but that (OH)-O-center dot can tear and oxidize its heptazine units to form cyameluric acid and further release nitrates into the aqueous environment. Fortunately, (OH)-O-center dot usually attacks organic pollutants in wastewater in preference to g-C3N4, thus preserving the working stability of gC(3)N(4) and the steady operation of photocatalytic ozonation. This AOP, which serves as an in situ (OH)-O-center dot manufacturer, would be of interest to a broad chemistry world since (OH)-O-center dot radicals are active species not only for environmental applications but also for organic synthesis, polymerization, zeolite synthesis, and protein footprinting.									38	0	0	0	14	0	38			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000537147700005	32159322	
J	Chen, Peng; Liu, Qi-zhi								Genome-wide characterization of the WRKY gene family in cultivated strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) and the importance of several group III members in continuous cropping								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				9						8423	10.1038/s41598-019-44479-7				JUN 10 2019	2019	WRKY transcription factors play important roles in many plant developmental processes and adaptation to the environment. However, little knowledge is available about the WRKY gene family in cultivated strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.), an important soft fruit worldwide. In this study, a total of 47 WRKY gene members were identified and renamed on the basis of their order on the chromosomes. According to their evolutionary events and conserved structure, the 47 FaWRKYs were divided into three major groups with several subgroups. A cis-element analysis showed that all FaWRKYs possessed at least one stress response-related cis-element. Comprehensive analysis, including phylogenetic analysis and expression profiling, based on real-time qPCR analysis in root, stem, leaf and fruit was performed on group III Fa WRKY genes. The phylogenetic tree of the WRKY III genes in cultivated strawberry, wild Strawberry, Arabidopsis, tomato, and rice was divided into five clades. Additionally, the expression profiles of the Fa WRKY genes in response to continuous cropping were further investigated based on RNA-seq data. FaWRKY25, FaWRKY32, and FaWRKY45, which are group III Fa WRKY genes, were upregulated after continuous cropping. The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the expression levels of PR1 and peroxidase were higher in continuous cropping (CC) than in non-continuous cropping (NCC). The results indicated that group III FaWRKYs might play an important role in continuous cropping. These results provide a foundation for genetic improvements for continuous cropping tolerance in cultivated strawberry.									13	3	0	0	9	0	15			2045-2322			WOS:000470847700020	31182725	
J	Hasegawa, K; Kusunoki, M; Inoue, Y; Ono, TA								Simulation of S-2-state multiline EPR signal in oriented photosystem II membranes: Structural implications for the manganese cluster in an oxygen-evolving complex								BIOCHEMISTRY				37	26			9457	9465		10.1021/bi973057f				JUN 30 1998	1998	High-quality angular-dependent spectra of multiline electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals from the St-state Mn cluster in a photosynthetic oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) were obtained for partially oriented photosystem (PS) II membranes, and the magnetic structure of the Mn cluster has been studied by simulation analysis. The angular-dependent multiline spectra were simulated by taking into account the anisotropic properties of both hyperfine tensors of intrinsic Mn ions and g-tensor of the cluster in a tetranuclear model. The best-fit parameters for the simulation indicate that (a) the oxidation state of the St-state Mn cluster is Mn(III, IV, IV, IV), (b) the electronic orbital configuration of the Mn(III) ion is (d(pi))(3)[d(z2)(sigma)](1), (c) the effective g-tensor of the Mn cluster and the hyperfine tensor of the Mn(III) ion are axially symmetric, and their principal z-axes are nearly collinear each other, and (d) the z-axis of the d(z2) orbital of the Mn(III) ion and the normal of the thylakoid membrane are at an angle of 50.1 +/- 1.8 degrees. The results are compatible with those of the oriented XAFS study [Mukerji, I., et al. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 9712-9721], and indicate that the 0-0 vector of the putative di-mu-oxo bridged Mn(III)-Mn(IV) dimer unit in the Mn cluster tilts by 43-56 degrees with respect to the normal of thylakoid membrane. A model of the arrangement of the di-mu-oxo bridged Mn(III)-Mn(IV) unit with respect to the thylakoid membrane is proposed.									50	5	0	0	34	0	55			0006-2960			WOS:000074585100029	9649329

Heterojunction of vertically aligned MoS2 layers to Hydrogenated Black TiO2 and Rutile Based Inorganic Hollow Microspheres for the highly enhanced visible light arsenic photooxidation								COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING				185						107785	10.1016/j.compositesb.2020.107785				MAR 15 2020	2020	In this research, Rutile Based Inorganic Hollow Microspheres (RBIHM) and hydrogenated anatase TiO2 nanoparticles decorated with MoS2 nanosheets (HBTiO2/RBIHM-MoS2 photocatalyst) using Pulsed Laser Ablation in Liquid (PLAL) followed by microwave irradiation. Formation of vertically aligned MoS2 nanosheets, RBIHM and HBTiO2 nanoparticles were confirmed by different characterization techniques. The spectroscopic analysis revealed phase transitions in HBTiO2/RBIHM nano and microstructures along with the formation of different crystal disorders such as amorphous layers, oxygen vacancies, trivalent titanium ions and formation of molybdenum oxide (MoO3-x) in MoS2. In addition, MoS2 films in HBTiO2/RBIHM-MoS(2 )nanocomposite showed both Mo5+ and Mo6+ oxidation state, which indicates that these films have a p-type conductive behavior. Furthermore, the interconnected layers of MoO2 nanosheets led to the formation of a porous like 3D nanostructure in HBTiO2/RBIHM-MoS2, which could significantly improve its photocatalytic performance. Arsenite photooxidabon efficiencies of 70.3% and 96.6% and arsenate adsorption capacities of 1600 and 5200 mu g g(-1) were obtained for HBTiO2/RBIHM and HBTiO2/RBIHM-MoS2, respectively. The synergetic effects originated from making RBIHM-HBTiO2, RBIHM-MoS2 and MoS2-HBTiO2 heterojunctions along with the surface and morphology modification in MoS2 NSs and HBTiO2/RBIHM can explain the nanocomposite superior photocatalytic performance. The present work can trigger a broad interest in the cost-effective nanoarchitecture of visible light driven heterostructured photocatalysts.									26	0	0	0	3	0	26			1359-8368	1879-1069		WOS:000518704500021

Glutamate, proline, and ectoine were the dominant compatible solutes synthesized by the various Bacillus species. The majority of the inspected Bacilli produced the tetrahydropyrimidine ectoine in response to high salinity stress, and a subset of these also synthesized a hydroxylation derivative of ectoine, 5-hydroxyectoine. In Salibacillus salexigens, a representative of the ectoine- and 5-hydroxyectoine-producing species, ectoine production was linearly correlated with the salinity of the growth medium and dependent on an ectABC biosynthetic operon. The formation of 5-hydroxyectoine was primarily a stationary growth phase phenomenon. The enzyme responsible for ectoine hydroxylation (EctD) was purified from S. salexigens to apparent homogeneity. The EctD protein was shown in vitro to directly hydroxylate ectoine in a reaction dependent on iron(II), molecular oxygen, and 2-oxoglutarate. We identified the structural gene (ectD) for the ectoine hydroxylase in S. salexigens. Northern blot analysis showed that the transcript levels of the ectABC and ectD genes increased as a function of salinity. Many EctD-related proteins can be found in data base searches in various Bacteria. Each of these bacterial species also contains an ectABC ectoine biosynthetic gene cluster, suggesting that 5-hydroxyectoine biosynthesis strictly depends on the prior synthesis of ectoine. Our data base searches and the biochemical characterization of the EctD protein from S. salexigens suggest that the EctD-related ectoine hydroxylases are members of a new subfamily within the non-heme-containing, iron(II)and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase superfamily (EC 1.14.11).									112	5	1	0	105	1	121			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000250309200004	17636255

The influence of heating rate on the products yield and characteristics of shale oil and non-condensable gases was determined. It was observed that the shale oil yield first increased and then slightly diminished as the heating rate increased. The maximum shale oil yield was found to be 15.696 wt.% at a heating rate of 12 degrees C min(-1). The non-condensable gases yield increased with increasing heating rate. There was a corresponding decrease in the shale char yield. The carbon and nitrogen weight contents of the derived shale oil increased with increasing heating rate, while those of hydrogen and oxygen decreased. The sulfur weight content was not significantly affected by increasing the heating rate. As the heating rate increased from 5 to 20 degrees C min(-1), the atomic H/C and O/C ratios of the derived shale oil decreased from 1.918 to 1.727 and from 0.116 to 0.048, respectively. Compared to crude oils, the produced shale oil had a higher atomic O/C ratio and a similar atomic H/C ratio, as well as a higher light oil content, which showed that the properties of shale oil were superior to those of crude oil. The liquid shale oil could be classified as a sweet and high-nitrogen oil in terms of the classification method of crude oil. Increasing heating rate decreased the content of saturates and aromatics and increased that of light oil, asphaltenes and non-hydrocarbons of the produced shale oil. The non-condensable gases contained high amounts of CH4 and minor concentrations of C-2-C-4 hydrocarbons. Increasing heating rate shifted the maximum concentration of C-1-C-4 hydrocarbons to higher temperature and increased the total content of C-1-C-4 hydrocarbons. The alkene/alkane gases ratio decreased from 0.45 to 0.29 with increasing the heating rate from 5 to 20 degrees C min(-1) which was linked to secondary reactions. The lower alkene/alkane gases ratio was possibly because the coking reactions dominated at higher heating rate.									33	2	0	0	1	0	34			0208-189X			WOS:000315576900004

Mutagenesis of P450 2A6 was done to expand its capability in the oxidization of bulky substituted indole compounds, which are not substrates for the wild-type enzyme or the double mutant L240C/N297Q, as determined in our previous work (Wu, Z.- L., Aryal, P., Lozach, O., Meijer, L., and Guengerich, F. P. ( 2005) Chem. Biodivers. 2, 51 - 65). Error-prone PCR and site-directed mutagenesis led to the identification of two critical amino acid residue changes (N297Q and I300V) that achieve the purpose. The new mutant (N297Q/I300V) was able to oxidize both 4- and 5-benzyloxy( OBzl) indoles to form colored products. Both changes were required for oxidation of these bulky substrates. The colored product derived from 5-OBzl-indole was mainly 5,5'-di-OBzl-indirubin, whereas the dominant blue dye isolated upon incubations with 4- OBzl- indole was neither an indigo nor an indirubin. Two-dimensional NMR experiments led to assignment of the structure as 4-OBzl-2-(4'-OBzl-1',7'-dihydro-7'-oxo-6' H-indol-6'-ylidene)indolin-3- one, in which a pyrrole ring and a benzene ring are connected with a double bond instead of the pyrrole-pyrrole connection of other indigoids. Monomeric oxidation products were also isolated and characterized; three phenols (4-OBzl-1H-indol-5-ol, 4- OBzl- 1H- indol- 6- ol, and 4- OBzl- 1H- indol- 7- ol) and one quinone (4-OBzl-1H-indole-6,7-dione, the postulated immediate precursor of the final blue dye) were identified. The results are interpreted in the context of a crystal structure of a P450 2A6-coumarin complex. The I300V change opens an additional pocket to accommodate the OBzl bulk. The N2297Q change is postulated to generate a hydrogen bond between Gln and the substrate oxygen. Thus, the substrate specificity of P450 2A6 was expanded, and new products were obtained in this study.									53	4	0	0	47	0	58			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000233666600083	16215230

A characterization by X-ray diffraction and neutron powder diffraction (NPD) has been carried out in order to determine the crystal structure features: these phyrochlores are cubic, space group Fd-3m, defining an intrinsically frustrated three-dimensional system. The Rietveld-refinement from NPD data at room temperature evidences an antisite cation disorder (distribution of Mn between A and B positions) that is accompanied by an increment of the oxygen-vacancy concentration due to the reduction of Mn4+ at the B position to Mn2+ at the A position. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was useful to evaluate the stability of these oxides in reducing conditions up to 500 degrees C. Magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate a ferromagnetic behavior, due to the random distribution of Mn4+ ions in the octahedral sublattice. At lower temperatures there is a polarization of the R+3 magnetic moments, which also participate in the magnetic structure. Aiming to evaluate these materials as possible electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) we determined that the thermal expansion coefficients between 100 and 900 degrees C perfectly match with those of the usual electrolytes; however, these pyrochlore oxides display a semiconductor-like behavior with poor conductivity values, e.g. 6 x 10(-3) cm(-1) at 850 degrees C for Er, which would prevent its use as MIEC (mixed ionic-electronic conductors) oxides in SOFC devices (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

These events can influence the upper atmospheric chemistry and produce optical emissions. We have developed different two-dimensional self-consistent models that couple electrodynamical equations with a chemical scheme to simulate halos and elves produced by vertical cloud-to-ground lightning discharges, compact intracloud discharges and energetic in-cloud pulses. The optical emissions from radiative relaxation of excited states of molecular and atomic nitrogen and oxygen have been calculated. We have upgraded previous local models of halos and elves to calculate for the first time the vibrationally detailed optical spectra of elves triggered by compact intracloud discharges and energetic in-cloud pulses. According to our results, the optical spectra of elves do not depend on the type of parent lightning discharge. Finally, we have quantified the local chemical impact in the upper atmosphere of single halos and elves. In the case of the halo, we follow the cascade of chemical reactions triggered by the lightning-produced electric field during a long-time simulation of up to 1 s. We obtain a production rate of NO molecules by single halos and elves of 10(16) and 10(14) molecules/J, respectively. The results of these local models have been used to estimate the global production of NO by halos and elves in the upper atmosphere at similar to 10(-7) Tg N/year. This global chemical impact of halos and elves is 7 orders of magnitude below the production of NO in the troposphere by lightning discharges.Plain Language Summary Lightning discharges can trigger transient luminous events in the mesosphere. Halos and elves, two types of transient luminous events, are seen as red colored discs or rings at altitudes between 70 and 90 km. These luminous events are a consequence of a cascade of chemical reactions triggered by the lightning-produced electromagnetic field. In this paper, we develop two self-consistent models to investigate the inception and evolution of halos and elves produced by different types of lightning discharges. These models allow us to quantify the predicted chemical impact of halos and elves in the mesosphere as well as to predict their rovibrational optical spectra. Finally, we estimate the global production of NO by these events.									18	0	0	0	2	0	18			2169-897X	2169-8996		WOS:000441965400033		
J	Ge, Qianyun; Guo, Yongbo; Zheng, Wangshan; Zhao, Shengguo; Cai, Yuan; Qi, Xuebin								Molecular mechanisms detected in yak lung tissue via transcriptome-wide analysis provide insights into adaptation to high altitudes								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				11	1					7786	10.1038/s41598-021-87420-7				APR 8 2021	2021	Due to their long-term colonization of and widespread distribution in plateau environments, yaks can serve as an ideal natural animal model for the adaptive evolution of other plateau species, including humans. Some studies reported that the lung and heart are two key organs that show adaptive transcriptional changes in response to high altitudes, and most of the genes that show differential expression in lung tissue across different altitudes display nonlinear regulation. To explore the molecular mechanisms that are activated in yak lung tissue in response to hypoxia, the mRNAs, lncRNAs and miRNAs of lung tissue from 9 yaks living at three different altitudes (3400 m, 4200 m and 5000 m), with three repetitions per altitude, were sequenced. Two Zaosheng cattle from 1500 m were selected as low-altitude control. A total of 21,764 mRNAs, 14,168 lncRNAs and 1209 miRNAs (305 known and 904 novel miRNAs) were identified. In a comparison of yaks and cattle, 4975 mRNAs, 3326 lncRNAs and 75 miRNAs were differentially expressed. A total of 756 mRNAs, 346 lncRNAs and 83 miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed among yaks living at three different altitudes (fold change >= 2 and P-value < 0.05). The differentially expressed genes between yaks and cattle were functionally enriched in long-chain fatty acid metabolic process and protein processing, while the differentially expressed genes among yaks living at three different altitudes were enriched in immune response and the cell cycle. Furthermore, competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks were investigated to illustrate the roles of ceRNAs in this process, the result was also support the GO and KEGG analysis. The present research provides important genomic insights for discovering the mechanisms that are activated in response to hypoxia in yak lung tissue.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2045-2322			WOS:000639562100106	33833362

We developed a site-specific deposition strategy to construct supported Au catalysts by rationally constructing Ti(3+)defects inTiO(2)nanorods and Cu2O-TiO(2)p-n junction across the interface of two components. The Au nanoparticles (similar to 2.5 nm) were selectively anchored onto either TiO(2)nanorods (Au@TiO2/Cu2O) or Cu2O nanocubes (Au@Cu2O/TiO2) or both TiO(2)and Cu2O (Au@TiO2/Cu2O@Au) with the same Au loading. The electronic structure of supported Au species was changed by forming Au@TiO(2)interface due to the adjacent Ti(3+)defects and the associated oxygen vacancies while unchanged in Au@Cu2O/TiO(2)catalyst. The p-n junction of TiO2/Cu2O promoted charge separation and transfer across the junction. During ethanol photoreforming, Au@TiO2/Cu2O catalyst possessing both the Au@TiO(2)interface and the p-n junction showed the highest H(2)production rate of 8548 mu mol g(cat)(-1)h(-1)under simulated solar light, apparently superior to both Au@TiO(2)and Au@Cu2O/TiO(2)catalyst. The acetaldehyde was produced in liquid phase at an almost stoichiometric rate, and C-C cleavage of ethanol molecules to form CH(4)or CO(2)was greatly inhibited. Extensive spectroscopic results support the claim that Au adjacent to surface Ti(3+)defects could be active sites for H(2)production and p-n junction of TiO2/Cu2O facilitates photo-generated charge transfer and further dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde during the photoreforming.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11				2073-4344		WOS:000546007000099

Here several features associated with the charge exchange process between the solar wind protons and Martian neutral upper atmospheres are described. The analysis is based on an empirical proton model derived from Phobos 2 observations interacting with the Martian atomic (H) and molecular (H-2) hydrogen, and oxygen (O) upper atmospheres representing solar minimum and solar maximum conditions. The region where the largest fraction of solar wind protons is lost by the charge exchange process is found to be a thin layer above the surface of Mars on the dayside resulting from charge exchange with the thermal oxygen. In general, the magnetosheath and ''magnetosphere'' (where the observed plasma takes on a different character in the Phobos 2 data) produce two distinguishable regions where the loss rate of solar wind protons is highest. Increasing solar activity increases the loss rate in the magnetosheath but decreases it in the magnetosphere. No significant increase of the absorption of the solar wind was found near the ''magnetopause'' suggesting that the decrease of the solar wind protons observed by Phobos 2 are not due to the charge exchange process. In addition to a reduction in the solar wind density, the charge exchange reaction results in energetic neutral atom (ENA) production. This paper considers some of the detailed properties expected for the ENA population at Mars. The ENA differential fluxes were found to be typically 10(6)-10(7) cm(-2) s(-1) keV(-1) in the energy range 0.01 - 1 keV. During solar minimum, the ENA production rate and ENA integral fluxes were found to be highest in the magnetosheath. At solar maximum the ENA production rate is highest in the magnetosphere, and ENA integral fluxes in the dayside magnetosphere appear to become comparable to the fluxes in the magnetosheath if the proton temperature in the magnetosphere is low. It is found that 1-3% of the original solar wind proton flux converts into ENAs before the bow shock. The ENAs produced upstream are undeflected and so may precipitate into the Martian upper atmosphere, depositing an energy flux of up to 3x10(9) eV cm(-2) s(-1) derived from the solar wind. These results both suggest the possible benefits of observing ENA fluxes around Mars and suggest the necessary parameters for detector design.									104	2	1	0	0	0	105						WOS:A1997XZ20800013

Oxidized carbon materials have proven to be promising catalysts due to their low cost and facile synthetic procedures. However, the nature of the active sites is still controversial, and direct experimental evidence is presently lacking. Here, we activate a carbon material with dangling edge sites and then decorate them with targeted functional groups. We show that quinone-enriched samples exhibit high selectivity and activity with a H2O2 yield ratio of up to 97.8 % at 0.75V vs. RHE. Using density functional theory calculations, we identify the activity trends of different possible quinone functional groups in the edge and basal plane of the carbon nanostructure and determine the most active motif. Our findings provide guidelines for designing carbon-based catalysts, which have simultaneous high selectivity and activity for H2O2 synthesis. The identity of catalytic sites for H2O2 generation in carbon-based materials remains controversial with limited experimental evidence to date. Here, the authors decorate various target functional groups on carbon materials and quinone-enriched samples exhibit the highest activity and selectivity.									125	9	0	0	11	0	127			2041-1723			WOS:000532362000008	32371867

Influence of the presence of Co(II) ions								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B				105	21			4840	4845		10.1021/jp004388w				MAY 31 2001	2001	The electroless dissolution of p-GaAs in aerated 0.5 M boric acid solutions, in the absence and in the presence of Co(II) ions in the solution, is reported. At the pH of these solutions, the anodic dissolution of GaAs occurs in oxide-forming conditions. The oxide film formed during GaAs dissolution is composed of Ga2O3. The evolutions of the morphology and of the thickness of the oxide layer are followed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray analyses (EDX), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). All of the results show that the oxidation rate of p-GaAs in an aerated boric acid solution is enhanced in the presence of Co(II) in the solution; the increase is larger for higher Co(II) concentration. This leads to an increase of the oxide layer thickness. From the position of the redox potentials of the various species present in the electrolyte, with respect to the GaAs valence bandedge, it appears that dioxygen is responsible for the GaAs anodic dissolution. At the GaAs/solution interface, O-2 reduction occurs, leading to GaAs oxidation. The mechanism of O-2 reduction at the GaAs surface is discussed regarding the energetic situation at the interface. The influence of the Co(II) on the kinetics of O-2 reduction is discussed, taking into account the results of the literature.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1089-5647			WOS:000169036800009

In this respect, caves in hypogenic environments are natural laboratories to study the compositional evolution of deep-endogenous fluids through the Critical Zone. Vapour Cave (Alhama, Murcia, Spain) is a hypogenic cave formed by the upwelling of hydrothermal CO2-rich fluids. Anomalous concentrations of N2O and NO2 were registered in the cave's subterranean atmosphere, averaging ten and five times the typical atmospheric backgrounds, respectively. We characterised the thermal conditions, gaseous compositions, sediments, and microbial communities at different depths in the cave. We did so to understand the relation between N-cycling microbial groups and the production and transformation of nitrogenous gases, as well as their coupled evolution with CO2 and CH4 during their migration through the Critical Zone to the lower troposphere. Our results showed an evident vertical stratification of selected microbial groups (Archaea and Bacteria) depending on the environmental parameters, including O-2, temperature, and GHG concentration. Both the N2O isotope ratios and the predicted ecological functions of bacterial and archaeal communities suggest that N2O and NO2 emissions mainly depend on the nitrification by ammonia-oxidising microorganisms. Denitrification and abiotic reactions of the reactive intermediates NH2OH, NO, and NO2- are also plausible according to the results of the phylogenetic analyses of the microbial communities. Nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation by denitrifying methanotrophs of the NC10 phylum was also identified as a post-genetic process during migration of this gas to the surface. To the best of our knowledge, our report provides, for the first time, evidence of a niche densely populated by Micrarchaeia, which represents more than 50% of the total archaeal abundance. This raises many questions on the metabolic behaviour of this and other archaeal phyla. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The structural study by XRD confirmed the formation of highly crystalline anatase phase of Cu-TiO2. The broad diffraction peaks of Cu-TiO2 exhibit the nanocrystalline nature of the product. The optical study by UV-DRS indicated the red shift in absorption wavelength with an increase in Cu doping, i.e., towards the visible region. The FE-SEM and FE-TEM study validated the formation of spherical shaped nanoparticles of Cu-TiO2 having sizes in the range of 20-30 nm. Considering the absorption in the visible region, the photocatalytic study was performed for water splitting and rhodamine-B (RhB) dye degradation under natural sunlight. The 2% Cu-doped TiO2 showed the highest photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, i.e., 1400 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1) from water, among the prepared compositions. The photocatalytic performance of Cu-TiO2 conferred complete degradation of RhB dye within 40 min. The higher activity in both cases was attributed to the formation of highly crystalline ordered nanostructure of Cu-doped TiO2. This synthesis approach has potential to prepare other highly crystalline ordered nanostructured semiconductors for different applications.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2504-477X			WOS:000591031400016

When used as photoelectrode, the fabricated TiO2/Cu2O core/shell NWAs show improved photo-electrochemical (PEC) water splitting activity to pure TiO2 NWAs. The effects of the CBD cycle times on the PEC activities have been studied. The TiO2/Cu2O core/shell heterojunction nanowire array photoelectrode prepared by cycling 5 times in the CBD process achieves the highest photocurrent of 2.5 mA cm(-2), which is 2.5 times higher than that of pure TiO2 NWAs. In addition, the H-2 generation rate of this photoelectrode reaches to 32 mu mol h(-1) cm(-2), 1.7 times higher than that of pure TiO2 NWAs. Furthermore, the TiO2/Cu2O core/shell heterojunction nanowire array photoelectrode shows excellent photostability and achieves a stable photocurrent of over 2.3 mA cm(-2) during long light illumination time of 5 h. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of TiO2/Cu2O core/shell heterojunction nanowire array photoelectrode is attributed to the synergistic actions of TiO2 and Cu2O for improving visible light harvesting, and efficient transfer and separation of photogenerated electrons and holes.

The lower reduction potential of copper ([Cu+(aq) + e Cu(s)], + 0.52 eV) compared to Ag ([Ag+(aq) + e Ag(s)], +0.80 eV) makes Cu(0) easily exchangeable by Ag+ ions via galvanic exchange without applying any external bias. In a two-step process, the Cu NPs are synthesized first on C-N surface by adsorbing Cu2+ precursors and reducing them by NaBH4. Due to unstable nature of Cu2+ in aqueous medium some Cu2O NPs (a mixed phase of Cu/CuO) were also formed. Thereafter in the second step, Ag+ precursors are brought in contact with the already synthesized Cu and Cu2O nanoparticles (NPs). The Cu and Cu2O NPs present on the surface of C-N are partially exchanged by Ag atoms to generate bimetallic CuAg/Cu2O NPs. Two atoms of Ag are expected to be deposited for every Cu atom replaced. As galvanic replacement occurs on the solid surface of carbon nitride, there is only a partial replacement of Cu and Cu2O atoms. The catalysts C-N/Cu/Cu2O and C-N/CuAg/Cu2O were evaluated for their performance towards methanol oxidation and carbon dioxide reduction. C-N/CuAg/Cu2O showed twice the current density for methanol oxidation than C-N/Cu/Cu2O in a 0.5 M methanol solution. Probably the reason for high activity of Ag than Cu is related to the weak bond of oxygen on silver substrate for oxidation reactions and strong binding affinity on cop-per substrate. In case of carbon dioxide reduction (CO2 reduction) the product was identified to be for-mate by oxidizing the product (formate) on a Pt ring electrode. The results revealed C-N/CuAg/Cu2O shows a better selectivity towards formic acid formation than C-N/Cu/Cu2O using the rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE). A probable reason may be the strain induced by alloy formation which could favor a reduced coverage of adsorbed hydrogen and a decrease in oxophilicity of the compressively strained copper.

The leaves were pre-adapted at 60-2000 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1) for 60 min to obtain different nonphotochemical excitation quenching, which was predominantly of reversible q(I) type (relaxation time 30 min). PQ was completely oxidized by turning the actinic light off and illuminating with far-red light for 2 s before the pulse was applied in the dark, 4 s after the actinic light was turned off. Electron transport rate calculated from fluorescence transients considering PS II donor side resistance (V. Oja, A. Laisk, submitted) was maximal at the beginning of pulses (J(Fi)) and decreased immediately. The dependences of J(Fi) On pulse absorbed flux density were rectangular hyperbolas with K-m about 7500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Both the extrapolated plateau J(Fm) and initial slope (intrinsic quantum yield of PS II, Y-m) decreased proportionally when q(I) increased from minimum to maximum (J(Fm) from 2860 to 1450 mu mol e(-) m(-2) s(-1) and Y-m from 0.41 to 0.23). The time constant for electron transfer away from the PS II acceptor side, calculated from a model of PS II electron transport for 2 mu mol PS II m(-2), increased from 607 to 1315 mus with the activation of q(I) while the donor side time constant changed from 289 to 329 mus. These results show that changes in the electron transfer processes on the acceptor side of PS II occur in parallel with nonphotochemical (predominantly reversible q(I) type) excitation quenching.

The production of hydrogen in green algae is catalyzed by hydrogenases, which are small monomeric enzymes with high conversion efficiency and high oxygen sensitivity. Most green algae analyzed to date where hydrogenase genes are detected, have been shown to contain two distinct hydrogenases. However, very little is known about which functions the two different enzymes represent. There are also many unknowns within the mechanisms behind hydrogen production as to the roles hydrogenases play under different conditions, and consequently also about the potential for optimization of a hydrogen production process which could be found in this respect. This study focuses on the possibility for the presence of more than two hydrogenases in a single green alga. A large number of degenerate primers were designed and used to produce 3'-RACE products, which in turn were used to design gene specific primers used for PCR and 5'-RACE reactions. The sequences were aligned with known algal hydrogenases to identify products which had homology to these. Products where homology was identified were then explored further. A high number of clones from each band were sequenced to identify products with similar lengths which would not show up as separate bands on a gel. Sequences found to have homology with algal hydrogenases were translated into putative amino acid sequences and analyzed further to obtain detailed information about the presence of specific amino acids with known functions in the enzyme. This information was used to evaluate the likelihood of these transcripts coding for true hydrogenases, versus hydrogenase-like or narf-like proteins. We here present evidence showing that Chlamydomonas noctigama is able to transcribe three genes which share a significant number of characteristics with other known algal FeFe-hydrogenases. The three genes have been annotated HYDA1, HYDA2 and HYDA3. (C) 2009 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The smaller ionic radii of Y3+ in SrBi2Ta2O9 decreases the lattice parameters and increases the orthorhombic distortion (b/a) confirms the lattice mismatch in the perovskite structures by X-ray diffraction. Micro- Raman spectroscopy is used to identify the various modes of metal-oxide bonds in the system. A decrease in Raman intensity and increase in full width at half-maximum of the Ta-O stretching mode at 800 cm(-1) may be due to a decrease in orthorhombic distortion of the unit cells. Temperature dependence dielectric study shows the ferroelectric to paraelectric transition above 270 degrees C and donor substitution reduces the dielectric loss. Using a ferroelectric capacitor model, the expression for switching dipoles polarization (P) dependence of the electric field (E) is used to fit the P-E loop and gives best fit with the experimental data. The equivalent electrical circuit is modeled to identify the different components by complex impedance spectroscopy and KWW function is used to confirm the respective components by modulus spectroscopy. The water splitting photo catalysis of Sr1-xY2x/3Bi2Ta2O9 ferroelectrics for H-2/O-2 evolution from water in the presence of sacrificial reagents are also tested. The highest rate of H-2/O-2 evolution achieved for these modified ferroelectric materials under UV-light irradiation (350WHg lamp) is about 1.7 folds higher than that of pure SrBi2Ta2O9. Improved photoactivity is restructured in terms of effective charge severance of photogenerated e(-)/h(+). pairs owing to the favourable ferroelectric polarization.

Here, we report a facile in situ process to decorate ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets (NSs) with a co-catalyst, Cu2MoS4, for photocatalytic water splitting. The as-obtained Cu2MoS4/g-C3N4 exhibits a superior photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate of 2170.5 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) under visible light irradiation, which is nearly 677 and 34 times higher than that of bulk g-C3N4 and g-C3N4 NSs, respectively, and far exceeds that of most g-C3N4 catalysts modified with other sulphide co-catalysts reported in the literature, demonstrating that Cu2MoS4 can serve as a promising non-noble metal co-catalyst to couple with g-C3N4 for highly efficient photocatalysts. Structural characterization confirms the well-defined morphology of Cu2MoS4/g-C3N4 in which Cu2MoS4 hollow spheres are uniformly attached on the ultrathin g-C3N4 NSs with numerous micropores and vacancies. The optical properties indicate that Cu2MoS4/gC(3)N(4) possesses a superb visible light absorption ability. The photoluminescence spectra, photocurrent response, and electrochemical impedance spectra combine to prove the highly efficient separation and migration of photogenerated electrons and holes. All these factors synergistically enhance the photocatalytic activity of Cu2MoS4/g-C3N4 for photocatalytic water splitting, providing new insights into the rational design of high-performance visible light-driven photocatalysts based on earth-abundant elements.									27	2	0	0	3	0	28			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000445750100018

Heynh.. All photosynthetic measurements were made at the temperature of exposure: 23 degreesC for non-acclimated plants and 5 degreesC for cold-stressed and cold-acclimated plants. Three-day cold-stress treatments at 5 degreesC inhibited light-saturated rates of CO2 assimilation and O-2 evolution by approximately 75%. The 3-day exposure to 5 degreesC also increased the proportion of reduced QA by 50%, decreased the yield of PSII electron transport by 65% and decreased PSI activity by 31%. In contrast, long-term cold acclimation resulted in a strong but incomplete recovery of light-saturated photosynthesis at 5 degreesC. The rates of light-saturated CO2 and O-2 gas exchange and the in vivo yield of PSII activity under light-saturating conditions were only 35-40% lower, and the relative redox state of QA only 20% lower, at 5 degreesC after cold acclimation than in controls at 23 degreesC. PSI activity showed full recovery during long-term cold acclimation. Neither short-term cold stress nor long-term cold acclimation of Arabidopsis was associated with a limitation in ATP, and both treatments resulted in an increase in the ATP/NADPH ratio. This increase in ATP/NADPH was associated with an inhibition of PSI cyclic electron transport but there was no apparent change in the Mehler reaction activity in either cold-stressed or cold-acclimated leaves. Cold acclimation also resulted in an increase in the reduction state of the stroma, as indicated by an increased total activity and activation state of NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase, and increased light-dependent activities of the major regulatory enzymes of the oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway. We suggest that the photosynthetic capacity during cold stress as well as cold acclimation is altered by limitations at the level of consumption of reducing power in carbon metabolism.									95	1	0	0	89	0	98			0032-0935	1432-2048		WOS:000173200900017	11800395

Specifically, combining multiple semiconductors to separate charges effectively is an achievable way to improve photocatalytic hydrogen production. In this study, a novel photocatalyst which tricobalt tetraoxide (Co3O4) modified graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets and at the same time their adhered to onedimensional carbon fibers (CNFs) carrier (denoted as Co3O4@g-C3N4/CNFs) was successfully prepared. The single CNFs was obtained by electrospinning technique and high temperature calcination. The g-C3N4/CNFs was fabricated through the vapor deposition method. After that, the Co3O4@g-C3N4/CNFs photocatalyst was successfully composed with the hydrothermal treatment of cobalt chloride hexahydrate and roasting technology under air condition. In addition, the photoactivity of the catalysts was evaluated by hydrogen production from photocatalytic water splitting, and the result showed that the hydrogen evolution rate was in the following order: Co3O4@g-C3N4/CNFs composite > g-C3N4/CNFs. The composite of Co3O4@g-C3N4/CNFs exhibited a hydrogen production rate of 67.17 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), while the rate for hydrogen production of g-C3N4/CNFs was 49.67 mu mol g(-1) h(-1). It was known that the Co3O4 particles which were uniformly dispersed on the surface of gC(3)N(4)/CNFs efficiently enhanced separation photo-generated electron-hole pairs, thus improving the visible-light photocatalytic activity.									29	0	0	0	4	0	29			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000504350600090

The A1(2)O(3)-Pt composite bond-coats about 6-8 prn thick have rough and porous surfates, and show a good adhesion with the substrate. The La2Zr2O7-Pt top-coats with a thickness of 12011m possess a crack-free surface and are composed of pyrochloreLa(2)Zr(2)O(7). Owing to the chemical interaction between the La2Zr2O7 and molten mixture of Na2SO4 + V2O5, such TBCs do not possess a good hot corrosion resistance. However, it is demonstrated, from the cyclic oxidation test, thermal insulation capability test and mechanical properties test, that such TBCs possess not only excellent resistance to oxidation and spallation, but also quite well thermal insulation. These beneficial effects can be attributed to that: such TBCs can prevent high-temperature oxidation owing to the low oxygen diffusion rate of Al2O3 and La2Zr2O7, provide well thermal insulation owing to the low thermal conductivity of La2Zr2O7-Pt top-coat, and possess good mechanical properties owing to the toughening effect of Pt particles.

J	Gong, Shuaiqi; Fan, Jinchen; Cecen, Volkan; Huang, Cunping; Min, Yulin; Xu, Qunjie; Li, Hexing								Noble-metal and cocatalyst free W2N/C/TiO photocatalysts for efficient photocatalytic overall water splitting in visible and near-infrared light regions								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				405						126913	10.1016/j.cej.2020.126913				FEB 1 2021	2021	Photocatalysts that can not only harvest broader solar irradiation (from UV to near infrared (NIR) light region) but also achieve higher solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency are critical for solar hydrogen economy. In this research, we report a ternary bridge chain W2N/C/TiO photocatalyst for the first time to realize an efficient and stable visible and NIR light driven water splitting. This photocatalyst can realize overall water splitting using bifunctional mechanism with hydrogen (H-2) generation part and oxygen (O-2) generation part. The optimal H-2 and O-2 generation rates based on the W2N/C/TiO photocatalyst are 2.01 and 1.11 mu mol g(-1)h(-1) under the irradiation of NIR light (lambda > 700 nm). In this new photocatalyst, W2N and TiO were integrated into nanosized carbon fibers that serve as H-2 and O-2 evolution active sites. And the hydrogen apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for W2N/C/TiO composite photocatalyst for NIR light water splitting can reach as high as 2.14% at 700 +/- 15 nm. This research indicates that W2N/C/TiO photocatalyst can be effective under broaden (Ultraviolet, Visible and Near-Infrared) light. Combining interfacial and electrochemical characterizations, we have found that W2N/C/TiO photocatalyst can efficiently separate charges through the interfaces between C/W2N and C/TiO and harvest low energy photons in NIR region. Because of the bridge chain structure among W2N, C, and TiO electron transfer from W2N to TiO via C can promote charge separation and impede the recombination of photo-generated electron and hole pairs. It is therefore that this bridge chain structured W2N/C/TiO nanofiber photocatalyst can be a promising material for overall water splitting due to the capacity to utilize a broader solar spectrum.									32	0	0	0	2	0	32			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000621234600001

Shoot biomass, root biomass and root length were decreased after 10 d of NP treatment, especially in high NP concentration treatment (10 and 50 mg L-1). Levels of chlorophyll decreased but proline increased in leaves. NP caused oxidative stress; malondialdehyde content was increased with NP treatment, and the activities of ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, CuZnSOD and MnSOD were induced in leaves. The proteome of leaf tissue was analyzed by 2-D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. NP might adversely affect the CO2 assimilation, signal transduction, the endo-membrane system and photosynthetic oxygeh evolution. NP affects the proteome and physiologic and morphological features of A. thaliana during growth at the concentration can be observed in the environment. Because plants might be exposed to NP for a long time in the surroundings, more attention needs to be paid to the effect of NP on plants. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

These study regions consist of the northwestern (NW) and the northern (N) region, both located along the western and eastern parts of Eastern Himalayas and the southern (S) region (near Indo-Burmese Range and Naga hills) of the Brahmaputra basin which show distinct tectonic settings and sediment provenances in the Himalayan orogenic belt. Stable isotopic composition (delta H-2 and delta O-18) in groundwater suggests that some evaporation may have taken place through recharging of ground water in the study areas. The major-ion composition shows that groundwater composition of the NW and N parts are between Ca-HCO3 and Ca-Na-HCO3 while the S-region is dominated by Na-Ca-HCO3 hydrochemical facies. The major mineralogical composition of aquifer sediments indicates the dominant presence of iron(Fe)-oxide and oxyhydroxides, mica (muscovite and biotite), feldspar, pyroxene, amphibole, abundance of quartz and clay minerals whereas clay is predominantly present in sediments of S-aquifers. These mafic minerals, aluminosilicates and clay minerals might offer available reactive surface for As-adsorption and co-precipitatation with amorphous Fe. These associated adsorbed and co-precipitated As might be released due to reductive dissolution of Fe-oxide and oxyhydroxides in groundwater. These minerals are assumed to be possible sources of As in groundwater. The stability diagrams of groundwater data suggest that solute might have been introduced into groundwater from weathering of K-feldspar, plagioclase, pyroxene of Himalayan rocks, the Siwalik Group and Eastern Syntaxes in NW and N-regions. However, basic cations might be derived from weathering of K-feldspar, plagioclase, pyroxene and olivine those being major constituents in a gabbroic complex (ophiolite) and basalt terrain in S-region. The aquifers of S-region are severely contaminated with dissolved As compared to NW and N regions. Almost more than 92% of groundwater samples in the southern part (maximum 5.53 mu M or 415 mu g/L) are enriched with As, which draws a distinct difference from the NW and N parts of BRB aquifers. The redox-sensitive solutes (i.e., Fe, Mn, HCO3- and TOC) are positively correlated with As in NW and N-parts; whereas E-H shows negative to very weak positive correlation which suggests that a redox-dependent mobilization plays important role in As liberation in NW and N parts of the basin. However, As in southern aquifers is not showing any correlation or weak negative correlation with redox-sensitive solutes; suggesting that multiple reactions and hydrogeochemical processes and their interaction control As mobilization and fate in the S-region of BRB.The occurrence of high concentrations of arsenic in groundwater of Brahmaputra basin is described through a crustal recycling model and tectonic movement between the Indian-Eurasian plates and Burmese micro-continents. As-enriched groundwater in Himalayan foreland basin in the BRB is probably a result of crustal evolution through which As is subsequently mobilized from aquifer matrix to solution in groundwater by water-sediment reaction under favorable biogeochemical conditions. The results of the study indicate geological control (i.e. change in lithofacies, tectonic set-up) on groundwater chemistry and distribution of redox-sensitive solutes such as As.

Morphology design to restrain the growth of BiVO4 nanoplates with thickness around 20nm was achieved by adjusting the pH value and introducing graphene sheets. Then, the BiVO4/g-C3N4 (BVO-CN) hybrid photocatalysts were fabricated with different mass ratios of two components. The structures and optical properties of the BVO-CN photocatalysts were characterized by transmission electron microscope, scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. In application, the BVO-CN photocatalysts exhibited the catalytic overall water splitting activity up to 15.6molh(-1) for H-2 production and 7.3molh(-1) for O-2 evolution under visible light irradiation. A possible Z-scheme mechanism is proposed for the enhanced photocatalytic activity and was further confirmed by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. This study demonstrated enhanced overall water splitting photocatalytic performance of BiVO4/g-C3N4 photocatalyst by constructing a 2D nanoplates morphology and shed light on the morphology design of Z-scheme semiconductor materials.									26	2	0	0	0	0	26			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000468051900021

PCC 6803 when grown in the presence os sublethal (mu M) levels of cobalt chloride shows an enhancement of Photosystem II (PS II) catalyzed Hill reaction. This stimulation seems to be induced by cobalt ions as other metal ions inhibit para-benzoquinone catalyzed Hill reaction. At saturating white light intensity, this enhancement is two times over that of the control cells on unit chlorophyll basis. Analysis of the PS II electron transport rate at varying intensities of white, blue or yellow light suggests an increased maximal rates but no change in the quantum yield or effective antenna size of CoCl2-grown cells. There were no structural and functional changes in the phycobilisome as judged by the absence of changes in the phycocyanin/allophycocyanin ratio, fluorescence emission spectra, second derivative absorption spectra at 77 K and SDS-PAGE analysis of isolated phycobilisomes. The 77 K fluorescence emission spectra of the cells showed a decrease in the ratio of Photosystem I emission (F725) to Photosystem II emission (F685) in CoCl2-grown cells compared to the control cells. These observations indicate three possibilities : (1) there is an increase in the number of Photosystem II units; (2) a faster turnover of Photosystem II centers; or (3) an alteration in energy redistribution between PS II and PS I in CoCl2-grown cells which causes stimulation of Photosystem II electron transport rate.									3	1	0	0	6	1	6			0166-8595			WOS:A1993MX41700030	24318004

The magnetic nanocarbons were assembled as a flat membrane for heterogeneous degradation of organic toxins. The synergistic effect of nitrogen doping and metal alloy encapsulation significantly enhanced the catalytic activity and stability of NCNTs in catalytic activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for purification of an emerging pollutant, ibuprofen. The hybrid catalyst yielded a fast reaction rate of 0.31 min(-1), which was 23.4 and 5.8 times higher than that of pristine CNTs and monometallic (Ni or Co) encased CNTs, respectively. The robust membrane catalysis was further confirmed by degrading other organic aqueous pollutants, such as naproxen, sulfachloropyridazine, phenol, methylene blue, and methyl orange. Mechanistic investigation was performed using electron paramagnetic resonance and competitive radical screening tests, which indicated that radical (center dot OH and SO4 center dot-) oxidation and nonradical pathway co-existed and played critical roles for catalytic degradation. The study provides a novel advanced oxidation system with catalytic membrane for wastewater remediation.									93	6	0	0	35	0	97			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000457863500027

(I) Light is transformed into Gibbs energy with trapping times of 250 ps and 130 ps in open reaction centres of PSII membrane fragments and PSII core complexes, respectively. Assuming rapid Boltzmann distribution of excitation energy and taking into account the antenna properties (size and spectral distribution), the molecular rate constant of primary charge separation is estimated to be about (3 ps)(-1). (2) The electron transfer from Pheo(-) to Q(A) is characterised by a rate constant of (300 ps)-1. (3) The Q(A)(-) reoxidation kinetics are significantly retarded in D2O suspensions. These H/D isotope effects are interpreted as to reflect hydrogen-bond dependent changes in the protein dynamics that are relevant to electron transfer. (4) In PSII reaction centres closed for photochemical trapping the yield of a primary radical pair with lifetimes exceeding 1 ns is comparatively small (< 30%) at room temperature. Short illumination in the presence of Na2S2O4 changes the radical pair dynamics. (5) Photoinhibition under aerobic conditions impairs the primary charge separation and leads to formation of quencher(s) of excitation energy.

However, E. granulosus RPS9 (EgRPS9) has not been identified before. In the present study, the 657-base pair (bp) cDNA encoding EgRPS9 was cloned. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that EgRPS9 was similar to the RSP9 proteins from Schistosoma japonicum (SjRPS9, 86%) and Schistosoma mansoni (SmRPS9, 79%). Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that EgRPS9, SmRPS9, and SjRPS9 were clustered together. We detected the EgRPS9 gene and protein expression in PSCs exposed to artesunate (AS) which displayed a dose-dependent reduction in PSC viability for 24 hr. The results showed that the EgRPS9 ratio of the 10-mu M AS-treated (P < 0.01) and 40-mu M AS-treated (P < 0.05) groups were increased from that of the control group. In addition, the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the AS-treated groups increased in a dose-dependent manner compared to the level in the control group. In conclusion, the expression of EgRPS9 could be induced by ROS and might participate in the oxidative damage-based anti-parasite mechanism of AS treatment.									5	2	0	0	3	0	7			0022-3395	1937-2345		WOS:000419232400015	28902565

C. merolae inhabits an extreme environment (42 degrees C, pH 2.5) and the nuclear, mitochondrial, and plastid genomes have been sequenced. We analyzed expressed sequence tag (EST) data to reveal mechanisms of tolerance to high temperatures. The stromal ascorbate peroxidase (CmstAPX) that scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) was expressed at high levels (4th of 4,479 entries), thus, it offers clues to understanding high-temperature tolerance. CmstAPX has a chloroplast transit peptide (cTP) and a peroxidase domain. The peroxidase domain of CmstAPX has deletions and insertions when compared with that of Arabidopsis thaliana stromal APX (AtstAPX). To clarify aspects of tolerance to oxidative and high-temperature stress, we produced transgenic A. thaliana plants overexpressing CmstAPX and AtstAPX. CmstAPX plants showed higher activities of soluble APX than those of wildtype and AtstAPX plants. Fluorescence signals of a GFP fusion protein, immuno-fluorescence, and immunogold electron microscopy showed that CmstAPX was localized in the stroma of chloroplasts. Compared with wild-type plants and AtstAPX plants, CmstAPX plants were more tolerant to oxidative stress induced by methylviologen (MV, 0.4 mu M) and high-temperature stress (33 degrees C). CmstAPX plants retained the highest chlorophyll content when treated with MV and high temperature, and their stroma and chloroplasts remained intact in their chloroplasts, whereas they disintegrated in wild-type plants. Our results suggest that the increased activity of APX in the chloroplasts of CmstAPX plants increased thermotolerance by increasing ROS-scavenging capacity at high temperatures.									14	2	0	0	16	0	17			0721-7714	1432-203X		WOS:000271906000011	19859717	
J	CHEN, GX; BLUBAUGH, DJ; HOMANN, PH; GOLBECK, JH; CHENIAE, GM								SUPEROXIDE CONTRIBUTES TO THE RAPID INACTIVATION OF SPECIFIC SECONDARY DONORS OF THE PHOTOSYSTEM-II REACTION-CENTER DURING PHOTODAMAGE OF MANGANESE-DEPLETED PHOTOSYSTEM-II MEMBRANES								BIOCHEMISTRY				34	7			2317	2332		10.1021/bi00007a028				FEB 21 1995	1995	The role of superoxide in the mechanism of photoinactivation of the secondary donors of the reaction center of photosystem II membranes depleted of Mn by extraction with NH2OH plus EDTA (NH2OH/EDTA-PSII) was assessed. EPR analyses (g = 2 region) in continuous light, optical kinetic spectrophotometric analyses of P-680(+) and Car(+), and A(T)-band emission measurements were made after various durations of weak and strong light treatment of NH2OH/EDTA-PSII in the presence and absence of superoxide dismutase, or of PSII electron accepters to suppress superoxide formation. Additionally, flash-induced variable fluorescence of chlorophyll a and the capabilities of the membranes of photooxidize Mn2+ (in the presence of H2O2) via a high-affinity site (K-m similar to 180 nM) and to carry out the photoactivation of the Mn-cluster were determined. In the absence of any additions to the NH2OH/EDTA-PSII membranes which were highly depleted of Mn, weak Light treatment caused rapid (t(1/2)similar to 20 s) and parallel losses of (a) the similar to 10 mu s phase of P-680(+) reduction, which reflects the TyrZ --> P-680(+) reaction, (b) the amplitude of chlorophyll a variable fluorescence, (c) the capability to accumulate the TyrZ(+)-radical in continuous light, and (d) the capability to photooxidize Mn2+/H2O2 in continuous Light. As reported previously [Blubaugh et al. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 7586-7597], a dark-stable 12-G-wide featureless EPR signal centered at g = 2.004 was formed rapidly during illumination, This signal previously was tentatively identified as a Car(+) radical and was suggested to contribute to the quenching of chlorophyll a variable fluorescence and to the slowing of the TyrZ --> P-680(+) reaction. However, we failed to detect Car(+) formation by sensitive optical spectrophotometry and obtained no definable evidence for either a quencher of fluorescence other than P-680(+) itself or a slowing of the TyrZ --> P-680(+) reaction. Addition of a saturating concentration (96 units/mL) of superoxide dismutase diminished the rate of photodamage(s) by similar to 30-fold, but did not abolish it completely. Superoxide dismutase similarly suppressed strong light-induced photodamages, causing the loss of capability to photooxidize Mn2+/H2O2, to carry out photoactivation, and to generate the A(T)-band emission as well as TyrZ(+) EPR signal. In contrast to others, we found no evidence that the initial target(s) of photodamage is (are) different in weak versus strong Light treatment. The totality of the results suggests that the initial event in either weak light or strong light photodamage of NH2OH/EDTA-PSII is a decoupling of the redox activity of TyrZ from P-680. This occurs slowly when mediated by P-680(+)/TyrZ(+) hut much more rapidly in the presence of superoxide.									39	3	1	0	31	0	42			0006-2960			WOS:A1995QH59000028	7857943

Thus, the role of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) cannot be ignored, owing to its participation in initiating the Tot enzyme cascade. Here, we report the identification and molecular characterization of a teleostean TrxR (RbTrxR-3) ortholog that showed high similarity with the TrxR-3 isoforms of other vertebrates. The complete RbTrxR-3 coding sequence comprised 1800 nucleotides, encoding a 600-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of similar to 66 kDa. RbTrxR-3 consisted of 16 exons separated by 15 introns and had a total length of 12,658 bp. In silico analysis of the RbTrxR-3 protein sequence revealed that it possesses typical TrxR domain architecture. Moreover, using multiple sequence alignment and pairwise sequence alignment strategies, we showed that RbTncR-3 has high overall sequence similarity to other teleostean TrxR-3 proteins, including highly conserved active site residues. Phylogenetic reconstruction of RbTrxR-3 affirmed its close evolutionary relationship with fish TncR-3 orthologs, as indicated by its clustering pattern. RbTrxR-3 transcriptional analysis, performed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), showed that RbTrxR-3 was ubiquitously distributed, with the highest level of mRNA expression in the blood, followed by the gill, and liver. Live bacterial and viral stimuli triggered the modulation of RbTrxR-3 basal transcription in liver tissues that correlated temporally with that of its putative substrate, rock bream thioredoxin1 under the same conditions of pathogenic stress. Finally, resembling the typical function of TrxR protein, purified recombinant RbTrxR-3 showed detectable dose-dependent thiol reductase activity against 5,5'-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic) acid. Taken together, these results suggest that RbTrxR-3 plays a role in the host Trx system under conditions of oxidative and pathogenic stress. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Popelka, Hana; Yocum, Charles								Probing the N-terminal sequence of spinach PsbO: evidence that essential threonine residues bind to different functional sites in eukaryotic photosystem II								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				112	2			117	128		10.1007/s11120-012-9745-6				JUN 2012	2012	The N-terminal E-1-L-6 domain of the manganese-stabilizing protein (PsbO) from spinach prevents non-specific binding of the subunit to photosystem II (PSII) and deletions of the E-1-T-7 or E-1-T-15 sequences from the PsbO N-terminus reduce or impair, respectively, functional binding of PsbO to PSII (Popelkova et al., Biochemistry 42:6193-6200, 2003). The work presented here provides deeper insights into the interaction of PsbO with PSII. The data show that a single mutation, T-15 -> A in mature PsbO from spinach reduces the stoichiometry of its functional binding from two to one subunit per PSII and decreases reconstitution of activity to about 45 % of the wild-type control. Replacement of the E-1-L-6 domain with M-6 in the T15A PsbO mutant has no additional negative effect on recovery of O-2 evolution activity, but it significantly weakens both functional and nonspecific binding of the truncated mutant to PSII. These results suggest that the T-15 side-chain by itself is essential for binding of one of two PsbO subunits to eukaryotic PSII and that specific PSII-binding sites for PsbO are distinguishable; one PSII-binding site does not require PsbO-T-15 and probably interacts with the other N-terminal domain of PsbO. Identity of the latter domain is revealed by a requirement for the presence of the E-1-L-6 sequence that is shown here to be necessary for high-affinity binding of PsbO to PSII. When combined with previous results, the data presented here lead to a more detailed model for PsbO binding in eukaryotic PSII.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000305126200004	22614952

The procedure based on the Dynamic Hydrogen Bubble Template (DHBT) method included electrochemical deposition of Au layers onto the surface of the Au-SPEs, followed by a reductive process at -3 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) leading to formation of H-2 bubbles, which produced pores in the Au multilayer. The morphology of the micro-porous Au electrode was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), surface mapping, surface profilometry, and confocal microscopy. The electrode surface morphology was controlled by the time of the electrode reductive treatment (H-2 evolution) and the optimized condition resulting in the best surface structuring was found. Notably, the surface roughness leading to the highest electrode surface area was significantly increased compared to previously reported results with Au-SPEs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000789466800001

This work demonstrates the evolution of AuxPd1-x alloy nanostructures by the solid-state dewetting of sequentially deposited bilayers of Au and Pd on sapphire (0001). Various shape, size and configuration of AuxPd1-x alloy NPs are fabricated by the systematic control of annealing temperature, deposition thickness, composition as well as stacking sequence. The evolution of alloy nanostructures is attributed to the surface diffusion, interface diffusion between bilayers, surface and interface energy minimization, Volmer-Weber growth model and equilibrium configuration. Depending upon the temperature, the surface morphologies evolve with the formation of pits, grains and voids and gradually develop into isolated semi-spherical alloy NPs by the expansion of voids and agglomeration of Au and Pd adatoms. On the other hand, small isolated to enlarged elongated and over-grown layer-like alloy nanostructures are fabricated due to the coalescence, partial diffusion and inter-diffusion with the increased bilayer thickness. In addition, the composition and stacking sequence of bilayers remarkably affect the final geometry of AuxPd1-x nanostructures due to the variation in the dewetting process. The optical analysis based on the UV-vis-NIR reflectance spectra reveals the surface morphology dependent plasmonic resonance, scattering, reflection and absorption properties of AuxPd1-x alloy nanostructures.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2053-1591			WOS:000428776400012

The variations of physical properties in different deposition sets are analyzed by optical (XPS, FTIR, UV-visible spectroscopies), mechanical and electrical measurements. The films are considered to be deposited in a turbostratic phase (t-BN). Evolution of bonding configurations with increasing r is discussed. Relatively higher nitrogen flow rate in the source gas mixture results in lower deposition rates, whereas more ordered films, which tend to reach a unique virtual crystal of band gap 5.93 eV, are formed. Anisotropy in the film structure and film inhomogeneity along the PECVD electrode radial direction are investigated. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

By virtue of their rapid electron transfer and large surface area, CQDs also emerge as promising functional materials for the applications in energy-conversion sectors through electrocatalysis. Besides, the rich functional groups on the surface of CQDs offer abundant anchoring sites and active sites for the engineering of multi-component and high-performance composite materials. More importantly, the heteroatom in the CQDs could effectively tailor the charge distribution to promote the electron transfer via internal interactions, which is crucial to the enhancement of electrocatalytic performance. Herein, an overview about recent progress in preparing CQDs-based composites and employing them as promising electrode materials to promote the catalytic activity and stability for electrocatalysis is provided. The introduced CQDs could enhance the conductivity, modify the morphology and crystal phase, optimize the electronic structure, and provide more active centers and defect sites of composites. After establishing a deep understanding of the relationship between CQDs and electrocatalytic performances, the issues and challenges for the development of CQDs-based composites are discussed.

Strategies that produce H-2 without CO2 emissions focus on water-splitting powered by solar or wind energy. Here, we introduce a new approach in which energy derived from the oxidation of waste organic matter is used to subsidize the electrical energy consumed by electrochemical H-2 generation. The primary gas product is H-2, with minimal O-2 contamination, avoiding the purification step required for conventional water electrolysis. The energy efficiency (i.e., energy from H-2 combustion input electrical energy x 100%) ranges from 214% to 304%. We also demonstrate a sustained cycling operation with concomitant treatment of domestic and industrial wastewater. These findings open the door to recovery of H-2 from other dilute reservoirs of organic matter, such as marine sediment.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000408878200053

The hybrid Ni3S2/VG@NiCo LDHs catalyst exhibits excellent activity in alkaline solution for both OER (overpotential - 320 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm-2) and HER (overpotential - 120 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2). In addition, the hybrid catalyst possesses superior stability with 99% retention of voltage upon a continued current density of 20 mV cm-2 for over 24 h. It is found that the transitions of Ni2+/ Ni3+ and Co2+/Co3+ ions enable excellent HER and OER performances, and VG bridging between NiCo LDHs and Ni3S2, enable fast charge-transfer and a high density of active sites, resulting in the improved electrical conductivity, intrinsic activity, and electrochemical stability. This work provides a guideline to design the architecture of bifunctional catalysts for highly efficient water splitting applications.									17	0	0	0	3	0	17			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000643725900003

The authors investigate the conductivity of ZnO films deposited at temperatures between 100 and 200 degrees C as well as its evolution over a period of 160 days under different storing conditions. Most importantly, the conductivity increases by about 1 order of magnitude when the deposition temperature is increased from 100 to 150 degrees C. Highest conductivities of up to 170 S/cm are reached for >= 175 degrees C, and these samples do not show any aging effects of the conductivity under ambient storing conditions. In contrast, for deposition temperatures <= 150 degrees C, accelerated aging led to a significant decrease in conductivity. The best trade-off between the low deposition temperature and good long-term stable conductivity is found to be at 175 degrees C. A correlation between the intensity of the well-known defect photoluminescence peak (similar to 1.9 eV) and the conductivity was observed, which indicates that both are related to the same physical origin.

We focus on the temporal behavior of D-C(theta) as the system approaches equilibrium. We demonstrate that the effective D-C(theta) obtained in this fashion depends strongly on the time regime chosen for analysis of the density profiles, and thus may differ significantly from results obtained from equilibrium simulations within ordered phases and close to phase boundaries. This is due to the interplay between spreading and phase-ordering kinetics and is reflected in enhanced particle number fluctuations with respect to the equilibrium case, Also, both the effective diffusion barriers of D-C and the location of phase boundaries, as extracted from the data, depend on time.

This has been compounded by viral mutations that affect clinical response and primary epidemiological indicators. Multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified and classified on the basis of nomenclature implemented by scientific organizations and the World Health Organisation (WHO). A total of five variants of concern (VOCs) have been identified to date. The present study aimed to analyse clinical and epidemiological features of each variant. Based on these characteristics, predictions were made about potential future evolution. Considering the time and location of SARS-CoV-2 VOC emergence, it was hypothesised that mutations were not due to pressure caused by the vaccines introduced in December 2020 but were dependent on natural characteristics of the virus. In the process of adapting to the human body, SARS-CoV-2 is expected to undergo evolution to become more contagious but less deadly. SARS-CoV-2 was hypothesized to continue spread through isolated epidemic outbreaks due to the unimmunized population, mostly unvaccinated children and adults, and for coronaviruses to continue to present a public health problem.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1792-0981	1792-1015		WOS:000798254400001	35601074

The FVO NPH photoelectrodes possess uniformly dispersed polyhedral nanocrystals that directly grow on the conductive substrate with tunable film thicknesses. The unique morphology enables an outstanding photo-electrocatalytic performance, and the optimized FVO NPH photoelectrode, which was annealed at 550 degrees C for 4 h with a film thickness of similar to 560 nm, exhibits excellent photocurrent densities of similar to 0.47 and similar to 0.68 mA cm(-2) at 1.0 and 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively. After decorating CoPi co-catalyst, FVO/CoPi shows a highly efficient water splitting performance with O-2 and H-2 evolution rates of 7.53 and 15.32 mu mol cm(-2) h(-1), respectively, which are similar to 1.88 and similar to 1.80 times, respectively, of these of the FVO NPH. The proposed photoelectrodes also show excellently chemical and physical stabilities in solar water splitting. This is the first time reported the preparation of well-organized nanostructured FeVO4 films, which warrants further optimization studies on morphologies and compositions of FeVO4-based photoelectrodes.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000663965900001	34105262	
J	Li, ZL; Burnap, RL								Mutations of arginine 64 within the putative Ca2+-binding lumenal interhelical a-b loop of the photosystem II D1 protein disrupt binding of the manganese stabilizing protein and cytochrome c(550) in Synechocystis sp PCC6803								BIOCHEMISTRY				40	34			10350	10359		10.1021/bi0100135				AUG 28 2001	2001	Mutations D1-R64E, D1-R64Q, and D1-R64V in the putative calcium-binding lumenal interhelical a-b loop of the photosystem II (PSII) D1 protein were characterized in terms of impact on growth, extrinsic protein binding, photoactivation, and properties of the H2O-oxidation complex. The D1-R64E charge reversal mutation greatly weakened the binding of the extrinsic manganese-stabilizing protein (MSP) and, to a considerably lesser extent, weakened the binding of cytochrome c(550) (c550). Both D1-R64Q and D1-R64E exhibited an increased requirement for Ca2+ in the cell growth medium. Bare platinum electrode measurements of O-2-evolving membranes showed a retarded appearance of O-2 following single turn-over flashes, especially in the case of the D1-R64E mutant. The D1-R64E mutant also had a pronounced tendency to lose O-2 evolution activity in the dark and exhibited an increased relative quantum yield of photoactivation, which are characteristics shared by mutants that lack extrinsic proteins. S-2 and S-3 decay measurements in the isolated membranes indicate that D1-R64E and D1-R64Q have faster decays of these higher S-states as compared to the wild-type. However, fluorescence decay in the presence of DCMU, which monitors primarily Q(A)(-) charge recombination with PSII donors, showed somewhat slower decays. Taken together, the fluorescence and S-state decay indicate that the midpoint of either Q(B)(-) has been modified to be more negative in the mutants or that a recombination path presumably involving either Q(B)(-) or Y-D has become kinetically more accessible.									15	0	0	0	11	0	15			0006-2960			WOS:000170627800038	11513614

The quantum efficiency of 17.5 wt%-NiCo2O4/g-C3N4 can reach 4.5% under 400 (+/- 7.5) nm light irradiation. The greatly increased activity of 17.5 wt%-NiCo2O4/g-C3N4 can be attributed to the richer active sites and the superior electrical performance provided by co-existing nickel and cobalt ions with multivalent state. Moreover, the activity of composite almost shows no significant weaken even after 20 h irradiation. A Z-scheme route was put forwarded for H-2 production over NiCo2O4/g-C3N4 instead of the traditional p-n junction based on our study.									106	6	0	0	13	0	109			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000457863500041

We have identified a small protein segment where significant differences exist between rodents and primates, illustrating very specifically the need for compatibility of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes in the assembly of complex I. The segment between amino acids 39 and 46 appears to be critical for species-specific compatibility. Amino acid substitutions in this region were tested that caused a reduction of activity of the hamster protein or converted the inactive human protein into a partially active one. Such mutations could be useful in making mice with partial complex I activity as models for mitochondrial diseases. Their potential as dominant negative mutants was explored. More deleterious mutations in the NDUFA1 gene were also characterized. A conservative substitution, R50K, or a short C-terminal deletion makes the protein completely inactive. In the absence of MWFE, no high molecular weight complex was detectable by Blue Native-gel electrophoresis. The MWFE protein itself is unstable in the absence of assembled mitochondrially encoded integral membrane proteins of complex I.									58	0	0	0	48	0	65			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000176286000015	11937507

In this study, the accelerated stress test (AST) on carbon corrosion was conducted, and real-time CO2 evolution was measured in-situ by non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) analysis. The performance degradation was investigated by the reduction of the current density and the loss of electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of Pt. The loss of catalyst layer porosity and increase of mass transport resistance were investigated by the visible reduction of porosity and thickness in the cathode catalyst layer (CCL). Further mechanical tensile tests showed that the elastic modulus of CCL remained unchanged initially, and then increased probably due to the compaction of CCL. In the final step, it decreased due to the complete failure of the material. Thus, carbon corrosion was proved to alter the mechanical strength of CCL. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

To actualize a practical PEC water splitting, it is paramount to develop efficient, stable, safe, and low-cost photoelectrode materials. Recently, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has aroused a great interest in the new generation photoelectrode materials because of its unique features, such as suitable band structure for water splitting, a certain range of visible light absorption, nontoxicity, and good stability. Some inherent defects of g-C3N4, however, seriously impair further improvement on PEC performance, including low electronic conductivity, high recombination rate of photogenerated charges, and limited visible light absorption at long wavelength range. Construction of g-C3N4-based nanosized heteroarrays as photoelectrodes has been regarded as a promising strategy to circumvent these inherent limitations and achieve the high-performance PEC water splitting due to the accelerated exciton separation and the reduced combination of photogenerated electrons/holes. Herein, we summarize in detail the latest progress of g-C3N4-based nanosized heteroarrays in PEC water-splitting photoelectrodes. Firstly, the unique advantages of this type of photoelectrodes, including the highly ordered nanoarray architectures and the heterojunctions, are highlighted. Then, different g-C3N4-based nanosized heteroarrays are comprehensively discussed, in terms of their fabrication methods, PEC capacities, and mechanisms, etc. To conclude, the key challenges and possible solutions for future development on g-C3N4-based nanosized heteroarray photoelectrodes are discussed.									63	7	0	0	2	0	63				2637-9368		WOS:000669747200005

In this study, a facile route is adopted to fabricate a CoOx@carbon-reduced graphene oxide composite containing Co nanoparticle cores, carbon shells, and reduced graphene oxide. During hydrogen generation through the catalytic hydrolysis of NaBH4 and NH3BH3, the surface of CoOx cores provides active catalytic sites, and the carbon shells protect the CoOx cores from aggregating into gigantic cobalt oxide granules. The magnetism of CoOx anchored onto reduced graphene oxide sheets achieves effectively a momentum transfer assisted by a motional external magnetic field. In a batch reactor, the composite exhibits a higher catalytic activity in a self-stirring mode than that in a magneton-stirring mode. This simple and efficient synthesis strategy is highly promising for the next development of both facile hydrogen generation and core-shell composite functional materials.

Under evolutionary pressures of the sessile lifestyle, plants possess efficient systems of phenotypic plasticity and acclimation to environmental conditions. Molecular analysis, especially through omics approaches, of these primary lines of environmental adjustment in the context of climate change has revealed the underlying biochemical and physiological mechanisms, thus characterizing the links between phenotypic plasticity and climate change responses. The efficiency of adaptive plasticity under climate change indeed depends on the realization of such biochemical and physiological mechanisms, but the importance of sensing and signaling mechanisms that can integrate perception of environmental cues and transduction into physiological responses is often overlooked. Recent progress opens the possibility of considering plant phenotypic plasticity and responses to climate change through the perspective of environmental sensing and signaling. This review aims to analyze present knowledge on plant sensing and signaling mechanisms and discuss how their structural and functional characteristics lead to resilience or hypersensitivity under conditions of climate change. Plant cells are endowed with arrays of environmental and stress sensors and with internal signals that act as molecular integrators of the multiple constraints of climate change, thus giving rise to potential mechanisms of climate change sensing. Moreover, mechanisms of stress-related information propagation lead to stress memory and acquired stress tolerance that could withstand different scenarios of modifications of stress frequency and intensity. However, optimal functioning of existing sensors, optimal integration of additive constraints and signals, or memory processes can be hampered by conflicting interferences between novel combinations and novel changes in intensity and duration of climate change-related factors. Analysis of these contrasted situations emphasizes the need for future research on the diversity and robustness of plant signaling mechanisms under climate change conditions.									15	0	0	0	12	0	15			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000449650600001	30155993

We compare the effect of solar induced X-ray and EUV (XUV) heating on the upper atmospheres of Earth, Venus and Mars since the time when the Sun arrived at the Zero-Age-Main-Sequence (ZAMS) about 4.6 Gyr ago. We apply a diffusive-gravitational equilibrium and thermal balance model for studying heating of the early thermospheres by photodissociation and ionization processes, due to exothermic chemical reactions and cooling by IR-radiating molecules like CO2, NO, OH, etc. Our model simulations result in extended thermospheres for early Earth, Venus and Mars. The exospheric temperatures obtained for all the three planets during this time period lead to diffusion-limited hydrodynamic escape of atomic hydrogen and high Jeans' escape rates for heavier species like H-2, He, C, N, O, etc. The duration of this blow-off phase for atomic hydrogen depends essentially on the mixing ratios of CO2, N-2 and H2O in the atmospheres and could last from similar to 100 to several hundred million years. Furthermore, we study the efficiency of various non-thermal atmospheric loss processes on Venus and Mars and investigate the possible protecting effect of the early martian magnetosphere against solar wind induced ion pick up erosion. We find that the early martian magnetic field could decrease the ion-related non-thermal escape rates by a great amount. It is possible that non-magnetized early Mars could have lost its whole atmosphere due to the combined effect of its extended upper atmosphere and a dense solar wind plasma flow of the young Sun during about 200 Myr after the Sun arrived at the ZAMS. Depending on the solar wind parameters, our model simulations for early Venus show that ion pick up by strong solar wind from a non-magnetized planet could erode up to an equivalent amount of similar to 250 bar of O+ ions during the first several hundred million years. This accumulated loss corresponds to an equivalent mass of similar to 1 terrestrial ocean (TO (1 TO similar to 1.39 x 10(24) g or expressed as partial pressure, about 265 bar, which corresponds to similar to 2900 m average depth)). Finally, we discuss and compare our findings with the results of preceding studies.

Its genome has 10.7 Mb and encodes 4787 genes distributed in 8 nuclear chromosomes and one mitochondrial. Contrary to Kluyveromyces lactis, which has a unique LAC12 gene (encodes lactose permease), K. marxianus possesses four. The presence of degenerated copies and Solo-LTRs related to retrotransposon TKM close to the LAC12 genes in K. marxianus indicates ectopic recombinations. The Lac12 permeases of K. marxianus and K. lactis are conserved, however the conservation is higher between the copy of the left side of the chromosome three and the unique copy of K. lactis, indicating that this copy is the ancestor. The expression of the four LAC12 genes occurred in aerobiosis and hypoxia. Notably, the high lactose consumption in hypoxia seems to be related to the high expression of the LAC12 genes.

The properties of enzymes can be improved by directed evolution, which involves multiple rounds of mutagenesis and screening. By using mathematical models to predict the structure-activity relationship of an enzyme, and by defining the optimal combination of mutations in silico, we can significantly reduce the number of bench experiments needed, and hence the time and investment required to develop an optimized product. Here, we applied our innovative sequence-activity relationship methodology (innov'sAR) to improve glucose oxidase activity in the presence of different mediators across a range of pH values. Using this machine learning approach, a predictive model was developed and the optimal combination of mutations was determined, leading to a glucose oxidase mutant (P1) with greater specificity for the mediators ferrocene-methanol (12-fold) and nitrosoaniline (8-fold), compared to the wild-type enzyme, and better performance in three pH-adjusted buffers. The k(cat)/K-M ratio of P1 increased by up to 121 folds compared to the wild type enzyme at pH 5.5 in the presence of ferrocene methanol.									10	1	0	0	4	0	11			0006-3592	1097-0290		WOS:000491086600001	31520472	
J	Gericke, G. S.								Is there an emerging endosymbiotic retationship between mycobacteria and the human host based on horizontat transfer of genetic sequences?								MEDICAL HYPOTHESES				67	6			1419	1428		10.1016/j.mehy.2006.02.057				2006	2006	While not negating the seriousness of tuberculosis and the need to prevent and combat the disease effectively, the large percentage of infected, apparently healthy individuals who harbour Latent infections warrants consideration whether an endosymbiotic relationship is being established between mycobacteria and man. By means of a gene decay process eliminating their most metabolically important pathogenic genes associated with an increasing need for host gene products during prolonged intracellular survival, mycobacteria appears to be undergoing a process of establishing a less dangerous relationship with its host. To have tolerated this relationship over time, humans must have benefited. This is suggested to have occurred via changes in DNA higher order structure altering combinatorially regulated gene expression allowing increased cerebrodiversity. It can be expected that, beyond a certain threshold, negative effects ensued, leading to neuropathology and increased susceptibility for certain psychiatric disorders. These processes have probably been happening since the earliest contact with mycobacteria, but recently may have become modified by the emergence of epidemic tuberculosis and waves of increased oxidative stress following the circumstances associated with the Industrial Revolution and the more recent AIDS pandemic. The organism seems to have uniquely exploited the normal stress reaction of the host. Genomic stresses include changes associated with glucocorticoid effects as well as upregulated reactive oxygen species and stress/(heat shock) protein production, the latter two of which result in host cell cycle delay. Subsequently replication dependent chromosomal fragile sites appear in the host genome and together with upregulated chaperonins and mobile element activation, the scene is set for sequence exchange between the organism and host. If proven, these events raise the possibility of modifying chromatin epigenetically to retain the proposed advantages while silencing pathogenicity factors. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

CURRENT GENETICS				49	3			190	204		10.1007/s00294-005-0044-z				MAR 2006	2006	The red macro-alga Chondrus crispus is known to produce superoxide radicals in response to cell-free extracts of its green algal pathogenic endophyte Acrochaete operculata. So far, no enzymes involved in this metabolism have been isolated from red algae. We report here the isolation of a gene encoding a homologue of the respiratory burst oxidase gp91(phox) stop in C. crispus, named Ccrboh. This single copy gene encodes a polypeptide of 825 amino acids. Search performed in available genome and EST algal databases identified sequences showing common features of NADPH oxidases in other algae such as the red unicellular Cyanidioschyzon merolae, the economically valuable red macro-alga Porphyra yezoensis and the two diatoms Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira pseudonana. Domain organization and phylogenetic relationships with plant, animal, fungal and algal NADPH oxidase homologues were analyzed. Transcription analysis of the C. crispus gene revealed that it was over-transcribed during infection of C. crispus gametophyte by the endophyte A. operculata, and after incubation in presence of atrazine, methyl jasmonate and hydroxyperoxides derived from C20 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). These results also illustrate the interest of exploring the red algal lineage for gaining insight into the deep evolution of NADPH oxidases in Eukaryotes.									68	3	0	0	67	0	74			0172-8083	1432-0983		WOS:000235704000005	16344959

Compared with negligible photo-damage on bare polypeptide powders, significantly enhanced degradation in pre-solvated polypeptides was observed likely because of the formation photo-generated radicals. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) were employed as the analysis means to identify and quantify the chemical changes, especially the high-resolution photoemission spectra of C 1s, O 1s, N 1s and their evolution under continuous X-ray irradiation. The photo-degradation was found to preferentially occur on the C--O entity in poly-Gly and the guanidinium group in poly-Arg. In poly-Arg, deprotonation occurs via the switch from zwittterionic to a neutral configuration, whereas poly-Lys deprotonates by directly losing the corresponding amine. The critical role of the interactions between amino acids, the building blocks of protein and almost all forms of biological activities, and the free-radical-generating living environment under irradiation was critically analyzed. The present study found that the preparation history of a sample, especially its inadvertent exposure to the sources of H2O, O2 and OH, could significantly alter the outcome of a radiation-related chemical process. Implications on the non-destructive probe of biologically important systems using physical methods involving X-rays were discussed as well.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1011-1344	1873-2682		WOS:000660320800002	34049181	
J	Hanowski, NP; Brearley, AJ					Brearley, Adrian/0000-0002-7364-8815			Iron-rich aureoles in the CM carbonaceous chondrites Murray, Murchison, and Allan Hills 81002: Evidence for in situ aqueous alteration								METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE				35	6			1291	1308		10.1111/j.1945-5100.2000.tb01517.x				NOV 2000	2000	Iron-rich aureoles in CM carbonaceous chondrites are previously unidentified domains of aqueously altered matrix material, whose FeO content may exceed that of the surrounding matrix by up to more than 15 wt%. We describe the petrography and mineralogy of these objects in the CM chondrites Murray, Murchison, and Allan Hills (ALH) 81002. The size of Fe-rich aureoles ranges from a few hundred microns to several millimeters in diameter and appears to be a function of the degree of alteration of the host chondrite. The origin of Fe-rich aureoles is related to the alteration of large metal grains that has resulted in the formation of characteristic PCP-rich reaction products that are frequently observed at the centers of the aureoles. This suggests that Fe-rich aureoles in CM chondrites are the result of the mobilization of Fe from altering metal grains into the matrix. The fact that Fe-rich aureoles enclose numerous chondritic components such as chondrules, calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs), and mineral fragments, as well as their radial symmetric appearance, are strong evidence that they formed in situ and that significant directional fluid flow was not involved in the alteration process. This and additional constraints, such as the distribution of S and other elements, as well as the inferred alteration conditions, are consistent with in situ parent-body alteration. The observations are, however, entirely incompatible with preaccretionary alteration models in which the individual CM chondrite components have experienced diverse alteration histories. The presence of numerous intact aureoles in the brecciated CM chondrites Murray and Murchison further suggests that the alteration occurred largely after brecciation affected these meteorites. Therefore, the progressive aqueous alteration of CM chondrites may not be necessarily coupled to brecciation as has been previously proposed.									48	0	0	0	1	0	48			0026-1114			WOS:000166005400016

Herein, an LSPR-enhanced 0D/2D CdS/MoO3-x heterojunction has been synthesized by the growth of 0D CdS nanoparticles on 2D plasmonic MoO3-x elliptical nanosheets via a simple coprecipitation method. Taking advantage of the LSPR effect of the MoO3-x elliptical nanosheets, the light absorption of the CdS/MoO3-x heterojunction was extended from 600 nm to the near-infrared region (1400 nm). Furthermore, the introduction of 2D plasmonic MoO3-x elliptical nanosheets not only provided a platform for the growth of CdS nanoparticles, but also contributed to the construction of an LSPR-enhanced S-scheme structure due to the interface between the MoO3-x and CdS, accelerating the separation of light-induced electrons and holes. Therefore, the CdS/MoO3-x heterojunction exhibited higher photocatalytic H-2 generation activity than pristine CdS under visible light irradiation, including under 420, 450, 550, and 650 nm monochromic light, as well as improved photo-corrosion performance.

J	Yang, Jingbin; Li, Dongxu; Fang, Yuan					Yang, Jingbin/0000-0001-5393-7583			Synthesis of Nanoscale CaO-Al2O3-SiO2-H2O and Na2O-Al2O3-SiO2-H2O Using the Hydrothermal Method and Their Characterization								MATERIALS				10	7					695	10.3390/ma10070695				JUL 2017	2017	C-A-S-H (CaO-Al2O3-SiO2-H2O) and N-A-S-H (Na2O-Al2O3-SiO2-H2O) have a wide range of chemical compositions and structures and are difficult to separate from alkali-activated materials. Therefore, it is difficult to analyze their microscopic properties directly. This paper reports research on the synthesis of C-A-S-H and N-A-S-H particles with an average particle size smaller than 300 nm by applying the hydrothermal method. The composition and microstructure of the products with different CaO(Na2O)/SiO2 ratios and curing conditions were characterized using XRD, the RIR method, FTIR, SEM, TEM, and laser particle size analysis. The results showed that the C-A-S-H system products with a low CaO/SiO2 ratio were mainly amorphous C-A-S-H gels. With an increase in the CaO/SiO2 ratio, an excess of Ca(OH)(2) was observed at room temperature, while in a high-temperature reaction system, katoite, C4AcH11, and other crystallized products were observed. The katoite content was related to the curing temperature and the content of Ca(OH)(2) at room temperature were amorphous N-A-S-H gels and a small amount of sodalite. An increase in the curing temperature promoted the formation of the crystalline products faujasite and zeolite-P. The crystallization products consisted of only zeolite-P in the high-temperature N-A-S-H system and its content were stable above 70%. An increase in the Na2O/SiO2 ratio resulted in more non-bridging oxygen and the TO4 was more isolated in the N-A-S-H structure. The composition and microstructure of the C-A-S-H and N-A-S-H system products synthesized by the hydrothermal method were closely related to the ratio of the raw materials and the curing conditions. The results of this study increase our understanding of the hydration products of alkali-activated materials.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1996-1944			WOS:000406683000012		
J	Lambermont, B; Ghuysen, A; Dogne, J-M; Kolh, P; Tchana-Sato, V; Morimont, P; Benoit, P; Gerard, P; Masereel, B; D'Orio, V								Effects of BM-573, a novel thromboxane A2 inhibitor, on pulmonary hemodynamics in endotoxic shock.								Archives of physiology and biochemistry				111	3			224	31						2003-Jul	2003	Thromboxane A2 is considered to be partially responsible for the increase in pulmonary vascular resistance observed after endotoxin administration and to participate in proinflammatory reactions. The effects of a novel dual TXA2 synthase inhibitor and TXA2 receptor antagonist (BM-573) on pulmonary hemodynamics were investigated in endotoxic shock. 30 mins before the start of a 0.5 mg/kg endotoxin infusion, 6 pigs (Endo group) received a placebo infusion and 6 other pigs (Anta group) received a BM-573 infusion. In Endo group, pulmonary artery pressure increased from 25 +/- 1.8 (T0) to 42 +/- 2.3 mmHg (T60) (p < 0.05) after endotoxin infusion while, in Anta group, it increased from 23 +/- 1.6 (T0) to 25 +/- 1.5 mmHg (T60). This difference is due to a reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance in Anta group while pulmonary arterial compliance changes in Endo group remained comparable with the evolution in Anta group. In Endo group, PaO2 decreased from 131 +/- 21 (T0) to 74 +/- 12 mmHg (T300) (p < 0.05), while in Anta group, PaO2 was 241 +/- 31 mmHg at the end of the experimental period (T300). These results demonstrate that TXA2 plays a major role in pulmonary vascular changes during endotoxin insult. Concomitant inhibition of TXA2 synthesis and of TXA2 receptors by BM-573 inhibited the pulmonary vasopressive response during the early phase of endotoxin shock as well as the deterioration in arterial oxygenation.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1381-3455			MEDLINE:14972744	14972744

The effect of an ldhA mutation and different growth medium modifications was also assessed.Methods and Results:Expression of adhE in E. coli CT1061 [arcA creC(Con)] resulted in a 1 center dot 4-fold enhancement in ethanol synthesis. Significant amounts of lactate were produced during micro-oxic cultures and strain CT1061LE, in which fermentative lactate dehydrogenase was deleted, produced up to 6 center dot 5 +/- 0 center dot 3 g l-1 ethanol in 48 h. Escherichia coli CT1061LE derivatives resistant to > 25 g l-1 ethanol were obtained by metabolic evolution. Pyruvate and acetaldehyde addition significantly increased both biomass and ethanol concentrations, probably by overcoming acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) shortage. Yeast extract also promoted growth and ethanol synthesis, and this positive effect was mainly attributable to its vitamin content. Two-stage bioreactor cultures were conducted in a minimal medium containing 100 mu g l-1 calcium d-pantothenate to evaluate oxic acetyl-CoA synthesis followed by a switch into fermentative conditions. Ethanol reached 15 center dot 4 +/- 0 center dot 9 g l-1 with a volumetric productivity of 0 center dot 34 +/- 0 center dot 02 g l-1 h-1.Conclusions:Escherichia coli responded to adhE over-expression by funnelling carbon and reducing equivalents into a highly reduced metabolite, ethanol. Acetyl-CoA played a key role in micro-oxic ethanol synthesis and growth.Significance and Impact of the Study:Insight into the micro-oxic metabolism of E. coli growing on glycerol is essential for the development of efficient industrial processes for reduced biochemicals production from this substrate, with special relevance to biofuels synthesis.									33	0	0	0	24	1	33			1364-5072	1365-2672		WOS:000279733700012	20149000

Such stars would have been the first to form after the big bang and may have left a distinctive imprint on the composition of the early universe. When the supernova yields are integrated over a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF), the resulting elemental abundance pattern is qualitatively solar, but with marked deficiencies of odd-Z elements with 7 <= Z <= 13. Neglecting the contribution of the neutrino wind from the neutron stars that they form, no appreciable abundances are made for elements heavier than germanium. The computed pattern compares favorably with what has been observed in metal-deficient stars with [Z] less than or similar to -3. The amount of ionizing radiation from this generation of stars is similar to 2.16 MeV per baryon (4.15 B per M-circle dot; where 1 B = 1 Bethe = 10(51) erg) for a Salpeter IMF, and may have played a role in reionizing the universe. Neglecting rotation, most of the stars end their lives as blue supergiants and form supernovae with distinctive light curves resembling SN 1987A, but some produce primary nitrogen due to dredge-up and become red supergiants. These make brighter supernovae like typical Type IIp's. For the lower mass supernovae considered, the distribution of remnant masses clusters around typical modern neutron star masses, but above 20-30 M-circle dot, with the value depending on explosion energy, black holes are copiously formed by fallback, with a maximum hole mass of similar to 40 M-circle dot. A novel automated fitting algorithm is developed for determining optimal combinations of explosion energy, mixing, and IMF in the large model database to agree with specified data sets. The model is applied to the low-metallicity sample of Cayrel et al. and the two ultra-iron-poor stars HE0107-5240 and HE1327-2326. Best agreement with these very low metallicity stars is achieved with very little mixing, and none of the metal-deficient data sets considered show the need for a high-energy explosion component. In contrast, explosion energies somewhat less than 1.2 B seem to be preferred in most cases.									397	4	0	0	1	0	401			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000284096900030

SV-1T-MoS2 cocatalysts exhibit sulfur vacancies, O-doping, more metallic 1T phase, and high electronic conductivity, thus leading to the exposure of more active edge sites, high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area, enhanced visible light absorption, and improved electron separation and transfer, which are beneficial for photocatalytic nitrogen fixation. Consequently, the optimized 30 wt % SV-1T-MoS2-/CdS composites exhibit an outstanding nitrogen fixation rate of 8220.83 mu mol L-1 h(-1) g(-1) and long-term stability under simulated solar light irradiation, significantly higher than pure CdS nanorods, CdS-Pt (0.1 wt %), and 30 wt % 1T-MoS2/CdS composites. The catalytic mechanism of photocatalytic nitrogen fixation on SV-1T-MoS2 is discussed by density functional theory calculations.									115	5	0	0	4	0	117			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000514256400045	31951373

Vanadium oxide has been widely applied as smart window materials, however, no study has been reported to use it as dopant to improve the conductivity of graphene TCFs. In this study, we firstly reported that VOX doping can effectively lower the sheet resistance of CVD-graphene films while keeping its good optical properties, whose transmittance is as high as 86-90%. The optimized VOX-doped graphene exhibits a sheet resistance as low as 176 Omega/square, which decreases by 56% compared to the undoped graphene films. The doping process is convenient, stable, economical and easy to operate. What is more, VOX can effectively increase the work function(WF) of the film, making it more appropriate for use in solar cells. The evolution of the VOX species annealed at different temperatures below 400 degrees C has been detailed studied for the first time, based on which the doping mechanism is proposed. The prepared VOX doped graphene is expected to be a promising candidate for transparent conductive film purposes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Upon the discharge current modulation, the negative ion H- concentration decayed with the characteristic loss time of hydrogen H (1s(2)S) atom concentration. The evolution of H atom concentration was investigated by the time-resolved actinometry. The axial electric field was measured by double probe technique. The analysis of the experimental data, i.e. the dependencies of H- and H concentrations as well as reduced electric field on the discharge parameters (discharge current and pressure), allowed us to determine the rate constant of H- production in the discharge, where vibrational excitation and reactions with atoms H greatly influence upon H- production and loss processes. The main processes, which contribute to H- production, are discussed in detail. The vibrational excitation of H, is shown to increase the rate of dissociative attachment essentially not only via the excitation of the well-known low-threshold (epsilon(th)approximate to 3 eV) resonance of H-2(-)(X-2 Sigma u(+)), but also via the excitation of the high-threshold resonances of H-2(-)((2)Sigma(+)(g)(epsilon(th)approximate to 6 eV), (2)Pi(g), (2)Pi(u)(epsilon(th)approximate to 8-13 eV) etc). Detailed analysis of dissociative attachment via high-threshold resonances allowed us to describe experimental data in the whole range of E/N being investigated, whereas taking any other mechanisms into account (attachment to Rydberg states of H-2 etc) failed to do that.					1st International Workshop and Summer School on Plasma Physics1st International Workshop and Summer School on Plasma Physics	JUN 08-12, 2005JUN 08-12, 2005	Univ Sofia, Fac Phys; Fdn Theoret & Computat Phys & AstrophysUniv Sofia, Fac Phys; Fdn Theoret & Computat Phys & Astrophys	Kiten, BULGARIAKiten, BULGARIA	4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1742-6588		*************	WOS:000243496900022

To address these issues, herein, we have taken inspiration from cactus spines and pitcher plants to develop a slippery copper cone (SCC), which can facilely manipulate gas bubble in surfactant solutions (as low as similar to 29.9 mN/m, 20 degrees C), e.g., directional and continuous transportation of gas bubbles. This intriguing capability mainly originates from the cooperation of the conical morphology engendering a Laplace pressure and the slippery surface with low friction force but high affinity to bubbles. In addition, the SCC also shows an elegant capability of transporting gas bubbles in various organic solvents, such as formamide (57.4 mN/m, 20 degrees C), glycol (46.5 mN/m, 20 degrees C), dibutyl phthalate (37.0 mN/m, 20 degrees C), and dimethylformamide (35.8 mN/m, 20 degrees C). Furthermore, the prepared SCC also demonstrated distinguished feasibility in antibuoyancy bubble delivery, efficient collection of acidic CO2 microbubbles, and the underwater reaction of hydrogen and oxygen, endowing it with promising applications in various complex low-surface-tension environments.									41	3	0	0	1	0	43			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000466052900033	30884223

However, it remains a challenge to develop earth-abundant catalysts that can satisfy the demands of practical water electrolysis, that is, outstanding all-pH electrolyte capacity, direct seawater splitting ability, exceptional performance for overall water splitting, superior large-current-density activity, and robust long-term durability. In this context, considering the features of increased active species loading, rapid charge, and mass transfer, a strong affinity between catalytic components and substrates, easily-controlled wettability, as well as, enhanced bifunctional performance, the self-supported electrocatalysts are presently projected to be the most suitable contenders for practical massive scale hydrogen generation. In this review, a comprehensive introduction to the design and fabrication of self-supported electrocatalysts with an emphasis on the design of deposited nanostructured catalysts, the selection of self-supported substrates, and various fabrication methods are provided. Thereafter, the recent development of promising self-supported electrocatalysts for practical applications is reviewed from the aforementioned aspects. Finally, a brief conclusion is delivered and the challenges and perspectives relating to promotion of self-supported electrocatalysts for sustainable large-scale production of hydrogen are discussed.									45	3	0	0	1	0	46			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000691867900001

Polysulfone-based biomaterials have gained increasing consideration and are now the gold standard in the production of biocompatible hemodialyzers. However, even the highest biocompatibility now available cannot exclude that dialyzer membranes and the overall extracorporeal circulation may produce at the subclinical level immunoinflammatory reactions and thus an increased cardiovascular risk of patients on regular HD therapy. The lipophilic antioxidant and radical scavenger vitamin E has been used (as alpha-tocopherol) to modify cellulosic and synthetic hollow-fiber membranes with the ultimate goal to neutralize harmful reactive species and to mimic lipid structures of blood cell plasmalemma and lipoprotein particles. Besides filtration and biocompatibility, this modifier has introduced a third function of dialyzer membranes, namely 'antioxidant bioactivity'. Vitamin E can also serve as a template molecule to produce synthetic redox-active and -silent (non-antioxidant) modifiers for future generations of dialyzer membranes. This mini-review article describes the evolution of vitamin E-derived copolymers as a generation of biomaterials that has offered a clinical challenge and still represents a chance to further improving the quality of HD therapy.

To connect them, electron carriers negotiate tortuous multi-media paths and are subject to macromolecular blocking. Why does evolution select an apparently unnecessary, inefficient bipartition? Here we systematically explain this perplexing phenomenon. We propose that grana stacks, acting like bellows in accordions, increase the degree of ultrastructural control on photosynthesis through thylakoid swelling/shrinking induced by osmotic water fluxes. This control coordinates with variations in stomatal conductance and the turgor of guard cells, which act like an accordion's air button. Thylakoid ultrastructural dynamics regulate macromolecular blocking/collision probability, direct diffusional pathlengths, division of function of Cytochrome b(6)f complex between linear and cyclic electron transport, luminal pH via osmotic water fluxes, and the separation of pH dynamics between granal and lamellar lumens in response to environmental variations. With the two functionally asymmetrical photosystems located distantly from each other, the ultrastructural control, nonphotochemical quenching, and carbon-reaction feedbacks maximally cooperate to balance electron transport with gas exchange, provide homeostasis in fluctuating light environments, and protect photosystems in drought.

The preparation process of HCN-C-x includes preorganization of Lcysteine and urea under hydrothermal environment followed by thermal copolymerization, and carbon doping level can be precisely adjusted by changing initial urea/L-cysteine molar ratio from 5000, 1667, 1000 to 500. The characteristic results combined with theory calculations confirm that -C--C-C skeleton from L-cysteine are introduced into the heptazine framework of g-C3N4 by the replacement of some -C--N-C units; additionally, the introduction of -C--C-C skeleton can generate defect-induced midgap states in the band structure of gC(3)N4. The HCN-C-x nanosheets exhibit carbon doping level-dependent and notably elevated photocatalytic oxidation activity to three emerging organic pollutants including acetaminophen (APAP), levofloxacin (LEV) and methylparaben (MPB), in which the HCN-C0.5 performs the best. After visible-light irradiation of the HCN-C0.5 for 10, 8 and 90 min, the removal efficiency of APAP, LEV and MPB reaches up to nearly 100%. The excellent photocatalytic oxidation performance of HCN-C-x is dominated by carbon atom-self doping, which can not only enhance the visible-light harvesting efficiency but also boost photoexcited charge carrier transfer dynamics. Consequently, abundant reactive oxygen species including & BULL;O-2(-), O-1(2) and & BULL;OH are generated, and they are responsible for the elevated photocatalytic oxidation performance of HCN-C-x.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773396200003

Comparing with the conventional thin film composite (TFC) membranes, the TFN membranes comprising Na-CQDs have a larger effective surface area, thinner polyamide layer and more hydrophilic oxygen-containing groups in the polyamide layer. Besides, the interstitial space among the polyamide chains becomes larger due to the presence of Na-CQDs. As a result, the incorporation of 1 wt% Na-CQDs into the polyamide layer could improve the pure water permeability (PWP) of the membranes from 1.74 LMH/bar to 2.56 LMH/bar by 47.1% without compromising their NaCl rejection of 97.7%. Interestingly, stabilization of the TFN hollow fiber membranes containing 1 wt% Na-CQDs at 23 bar could further promote the PWP to 4.27 LMH/bar and the salt rejection to 98.6% under the same testing conditions due to the deformation of the membranes under a high hydraulic pressure. When using a 2000 ppm NaCl aqueous solution as the feed, the optimal water flux and rejection of the newly developed TFN membranes at 15 bar are 57.65 +/- 3.26 LMH and 98.6% +/- 0.35% respectively. The Na-CQDs incorporated TFN hollow fiber membranes show promising applications in the field of brackish water desalination. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, available models only have small datasets (<3200 records), make binary classification predictions, evaluate ready biodegradability, and do not incorporate experimental conditions (e.g., system setup and reaction time). This study addressed all these limitations by first compiling a large database of 12,750 records, considering both ready and inherent biodegradation under different conditions, and then developing regression and classification models using different chemical representations and ML algorithms. The best regression model (R-2 = 0.54 and root mean square error of 0.25) and classification model (the prediction accuracy from 85.1%) achieved very good performance. The model interpretation indicated that the models correctly captured the effects of chemical substructures, following the order of C=O > O=C-O > OH > CH3 > halogen > branching > N > 6-member ring. The consideration of chemical speciation based on pK(a) and alpha notations did not affect the regression model performance but significantly improved the classification model performance (the accuracy increased to 87.6%). The models also showed large applicability domains and provided reasonable predictions for more than 98% of over 850,000 environmentally relevant chemicals in the Distributed Structure-Searchable Toxicity database. These robust, trustable models were finally made widely accessible through two free online predictors with graphical user interface.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000848683300001	35973069

Herein, a g-C3N4/conjugated polyene (CP) complex is synthesized for the first time via a simple low-temperature calcination process. Lower photoluminescence intensity, longer fluorescence lifetimes, and higher photocurrent density of this complex than those of pure g-C3N4 indicate that CP works effectively as electron acceptors and quickly shuttles electrons through its high conductive network to decrease the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes of g-C3N4 and improve the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate from 810 to 1270 mmol/g/h under visible light irradiation. The complex prepared by calcination at 340 degrees C exhibits better photoactivity than those at 240 and 400 degrees C. Hydrogen bonds between g-C3N4 and CP not only help to transfer electrons, but also fix CP molecules firmly on the surfaces of g-C3N4. This complex shows an excellent physicochemical stability in the photocatalytic process as well. This work provides not only a novel cost-effective way towards the preparation of new efficient g-C3N4-based complexes with better photoactivity, but also a new modification route to other photocatalysts for enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production.

The cascade arrangement of packed-bed reactors maintained sufficient turbulence in the system besides eliminating the implications of film-diffusion resistance. The synergistic effect (10%) of in-situ dual process over individual processes has significantly reduced the treatment time of a recalcitrant antibiotic, Cephalexin (CEX). The reaction performance of the once-through cascade reactor system (comprising of six packed-bed reactors in series) incorporating in-situ dual effect at optimized conditions i.e. H2O2: 600 mgL(-1), flow rate: 50 mLmin(-1), with a space time (T) of 12 min approached to that of plug-flow reactor (PFR). The mineralization of CEX was evaluated through reduction in COD (70%) and TOC (63%) along with generation of anions and evolution of CO2. The treated solution of CEX was completely non-toxic as confirmed through Kirby-Bauer test and bio-assay analysis based on toxicity factor. In addition to this, Fe TiO2 composite beads depicted an excellent recyclability efficiency (>70 recycles) even under continuous flow conditions as confirmed through SEM/EDS, DRS, XRD, XPS and TGA analysis. The overall cost of treatment process was evaluated in detail to visualize the practical feasibility of the presented high performance reactor system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Air exposure is regarded as one of the crucial restriction factors in the crab cultivation and transportation process. Numerous studies have shown that air exposure stress can cause many negative effects on aquatic farming animals. However, the molecular mechanisms of drying on Chinese mitten crabs are still poorly studied. In this study, gill reference transcriptome was assembled and differentially expressed gene (DGE) analysis was conducted between air exposure 16 h and normal dissolved oxygen of Chinese mitten crab. A total of 76075 transcripts were generated and 50800 unigenes with a mean length of 1090 bp and N50 length of 1584 bp were observed. Transcriptomic comparison revealed 352 DEGs between air exposure 16 h group and control group, including 122 up-regulated genes and 230 down-regulated genes. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that these DEGs involved in 16 biological process subcategories, 8 cellular component subcategories and 6 molecular function subcategories. Further Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis annotated 352 DEGs to 85 pathways, and some pathways were regarded as related with immune system and diseases, such as phagosome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and alcoholism. Eight genes involved in multiple KEGG signaling pathways were validated by qRT-PCR. This study demonstrates the first gill transcriptomic analysis challenged with air exposure stress in Chinese mitten crab and provides valuable gene resources for understanding the crab gill immunity, which can provides insight into the immune response of crab against air exposure stress.									19	2	0	0	17	0	20			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000457666800095	30391295

Innumerable photocatalysts have been reported for efficient H2 production, but their large-scale production with the same efficiency of H2 production is a challenging task. In this study, a few gram-scale syntheses of ZnS wrapped with NiO hierarchical core-shell nanostructure via the surfactant-mediated process has been reported. Morphology and crystal structure analysis of ZnS/NiO showed spherical shaped hierarchical core-shell with cubic and face-centered cubic crystal structures. The surface examination confirmed the presence of Zn2+, S2-, Ni2+ and O2- ions in the nanocomposite. The photocurrent and photoluminescence studies of pristine and nanocomposites revealed that coreshell material is non-corrosive with a prolonged life-time of photo-excitons. Parametric studies on photocatalytic H2 generation in lab-scale photoreactor using crude glycerol in water recorded a high rate of H2 generation of 9.3 mmol h-1.g- 1 of catalyst under the simulated solar light irradiation. Optimized reaction parameters are extended to a demonstrative photoreactor containing aqueous crude glycerol produced 18.5 mmol h-1 of H2 generation under the natural solar light irradiation. The same nanostructures were further tested with the simulated sulfide wastewater and the optimized catalyst showed H2 production of 350 mL h-1. The experimental results of time-on stream and catalytic stability demonstrated that ZnS/NiO hierarchical core-shell nanostructures can be recyclable and reusable for the continuous photocatalytic H2 generation.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0013-9351	1096-0953		WOS:000663724900005	33989620	
J	Rosensteel, Wade A.; Sullivan, Neal P.								Fabrication and hydrogen permeation through novel BaZr0.9Y0.1O3-delta - Cu composite ceramic-metallic membranes								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				42	7			4216	4223		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.10.048				FEB 16 2017	2017	This study is the first report of a dense BaZr0.9Y0.1O3_(delta) - Cu (BZY-Cu) ceramic-metallic (cermet) composite membrane for high-temperature hydrogen separation. BZY serves as a proton conductor, while Cu provides electronic conductivity for charge compensation. A novel molten-copper infiltration technique is used to form a dense cermet membrane by infiltrating a porous BZY substrate. A porous BZY "skeleton" is fabricated from a spray dried powder provided by CoorsTek, consisting of the pre-cursor oxides BaSO4, ZrO2, and Y2O3. The powder is dry pressed into pellets. These pellets then undergo solid-state reaction and sintering in one step at 1650 C-omicron for 10 h to form the porous ceramic skeleton. Cu and CuO powders are mixed to form a powder containing 8 at.% O. This powder is uniaxially pressed into a pellet, that is placed on top of the BZY skeleton. The skeleton and Cu-CuO pellet are placed into a controlled-atmosphere furnace, and heated to 1200 C-omicron in a 330 ppm oxygen environment (balance argon). Under these conditions, the liquid Cu-O spontaneously infiltrates the BZY skeleton. While dwelling at 1200 C-omicron, the gas environment is changed to a 10 mol.% hydrogen environment (balance argon) for 12 h. Then the sample is cooled to 450 C-omicron and annealed for 24 h to reduce residual stresses within the membrane. Electron micrographs of the resulting membranes reveal that the cermet is nearly fully dense.Hydrogen permeation through a 1.90 mm thick BZY-Cu membrane was measured as a function of temperature and hydrogen partial pressure gradient. A maximum flux of 2.42 x 10(-3) mL(STP) cm(-2) min(-1) was observed at 882 C-omicron with a 1.0 atm hydrogen partial pressure gradient. The contribution of hydrogen evolution due to water-splitting at the sweep surface was examined by varying the humidification of the feed and sweep gas streams. Degradation of performance was not observed over the course of 30 days of testing; rather, a slight increase was seen. Electron micrographs of the BZY-Cu membrane after testing do not reveal porosity or cracking through the bulk thickness of the membrane. However morphological changes were observed at the surfaces. On the feed surface (highly reducing environment), Cu has left the BZY skeleton and formed Cu spheres on the surface. On the sweep surface, this de-wetting is more pronounced. Copper has also left the BZY skeleton and formed a nearly dense, non-hermetic layer of pure Cu. These changes effectively reduce the membrane thickness while also increasing surface roughness and the area of the gas-solid interface. This may explain the apparent increase in performance over time. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL				103	2			313	322		10.1016/j.bpj.2012.05.031				JUL 18 2012	2012	Photosynthetic O-2 production from water is catalyzed by a cluster of four manganese ions and a tyrosine residue that comprise the redox-active components of the water-oxidizing complex (WOC) of photosystem II (PSII) in all known oxygenic phototrophs. Knowledge of the oxidation states is indispensable for understanding the fundamental principles of catalysis by PSII and the catalytic mechanism of the WOC. Previous spectroscopic studies and redox titrations predicted the net oxidation state of the S-0 state to be (Mn-III)(3)Mn-IV. We have refined a previously developed photoassembly procedure that directly determines the number of oxidizing equivalents needed to assemble the Mn4Ca core of WOC during photoassembly, starting from free Mn-II and the Mn-depleted apo-WOC complex. This experiment entails counting the number of light flashes required to produce the first O-2 molecules during photoassembly. Unlike spectroscopic methods, this process does not require reference to synthetic model complexes. We find the number of photoassembly intermediates required to reach the lowest oxidation state of the WOC, S-0, to be three, indicating a net oxidation state three equivalents above four Mn-II, formally (Mn-III)(3)Mn-II, whereas the O-2 releasing state, S-4, corresponds formally to (Mn-IV)(3)Mn-III. The results from this study have major implications for proposed mechanisms of photosynthetic water oxidation.									52	0	1	0	21	0	53			0006-3495	1542-0086		WOS:000306522300019	22853909

In this study, we evaluated whether four polymorphisms in circadian genes CLOCK, ARNTL, PER2, and GNB3 were associated with diurnal preference in a Korean population. In all, 499 healthy subjects were genotyped for four functional polymorphisms in CLOCK, ARNTL, PER2, and GNB3. Composite scale of morningness (CSM) was applied to measure phenotype patterns of human diurnal preference. In addition, three subscale scores, i.e. "morningness," "activity planning," and "morning alertness," were extracted from the CSM. No significant associations were observed between CSM scores and CLOCK (rs1801260) genotype or T allele carrier status, CSM scores and ARNTL (rs2278749) C allele carrier status, and CSM scores and GNB3 (rs5443) genotype or C allele carrier status. However, total CSM scores and scores of its subscales were significantly associated with PER2 (rs934945) genotype (p = 0.010, p = 0.018, and p = 0.005 for total, morningness, and activity planning, respectively) and G allele carrier status (p = 0.003, p = 0.005, and p = 0.002 for total, morningness, and activity planning, respectively). The best model result obtained by performing multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis (chi(2) = 11.2798, p = 0.0008) indicated that interaction among C/T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in ARNTL, C/T SNP in GNB3, and G/A SNP in PER2 synergistically affected the risk associated with diurnal preference toward eveningness. These results suggest that circadian gene PER2 is associated with diurnal preference in healthy Korean population. Although polymorphisms in ARNTL and GNB3 were not significantly associated with diurnal preference, their interactions with the polymorphism in PER2 may synergistically increase the risk of diurnal preference toward eveningness.									16	1	0	0	9	0	18			0742-0528	1525-6073		WOS:000388746800015	27660894

This paper reports on development of a solid mixture to generate nitric oxide gas in the presence of horticultural produce. The solid NO-donor compound, diethylenetriamine/ nitric oxide (DETANO) was found to quantitatively liberate nitric oxide in the presence of a range of acidic substances including citric acid. A solid mixture of DETANO and citric acid with wheat starch added as a filler and moisture absorbent in the ratio of 1:10:20 was found to be stable for at least six months when stored in dry air. However, in humid air, absorption of moisture from the atmosphere led to reaction of DETANO with citric acid and the evolution of nitric oxide gas. When the dry mixture was placed in a container with strawberry and mushroom, the moisture given off by produce activated the mixture and resulted in a similar extension in postharvest life as achieved by direct fumigation with nitric oxide gas. Commercial use of such a solid mixture could be through tablets or sachets which are more manageable in a farm or packing house than gas fumigation. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

While analysing a plasmid harboring an NDM-1-encoding gene in Klebsiella pneumoniae from South Korea, we found a prophage region within the plasmid. We constructed single-prophage knockout (KO) mutants by gene replacement. The intact plasmid and plasmids with deleted prophages were conjugated into Escherichia coli DH5 alpha. Growth rate and antibiotic susceptibility were determined, and survival rates of strains were evaluated in the presence of antibiotics, such as imipenem, amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime, and piperacillin/tazobactam. A transcriptional response of sigma factor-coding genes (rpoS and rpoE) and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related genes from different operons (soxS, fumC, oxyR, and katE) to a subinhibitory concentration of aminoglycosides was monitored by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The prophage region consists of four cryptic prophages of 16,795 bp and 19 coding DNA sequences. An Escherichia coli transconjugant carrying the plasmid with intact prophages showed increased survival during treatment with various antibiotics, including imipenem and amikacin; however, transconjugants carrying this plasmid with a single-prophage KO did not. mRNA expression analyses revealed that sigma factor proteins (rpoB and rpoE) were highly upregulated by antibiotics. We propose that cryptic prophages in the antibiotic resistance plasmid may contribute to adaptation of the bacterial host to antibiotic stress.

Mesoporous materials possess a versatile defective structure as well as a large exposed surface, which are particularly important in photocatalysis. Still, the underlying impact of defects in mesoporous photocatalysts remains elusive, as limited studies detail the exact atomistic surface structure and how the concentration of defects is directly related to the photocatalytic activity. Here, we successfully synthesized ultra-thin mesoporous-structured anatase TiO2 and changed the overall concentration of defects by improving the crystallinity. Without Pt deposition, the highest H-2 production of similar to 3.507 mmol h(-1)g(-1) was obtained under simulated solar light. We interrogated the atomic structure using scanning transmission electron microscopy, which directly revealed the coexistence of the lattice distortions and point defects in the mesoporous TiO2. Improving the crystallinity in TiO2 reduced these defects and slightly enhanced the H-2 yield from water splitting, while the charge-transfer resistance increased. Further introduction of Ti3+ atomic defects decreased the charge-transfer resistance and facilitated the separation of electron-hole pairs in the photocatalysis. This study offers inspiration for designing efficient photocatalysts and provides valuable insights towards defect engineering in photocatalysts.									26	3	0	0	0	0	26			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000523184600007

Here, a template-confinement strategy is presented with nickel metal-organic framework (MOF-74-Ni) implanted on graphene oxide and incubated by low temperature phosphorization to become ultrasmall nickel phosphide nanocrystals anchored on reduced graphene oxide (termed Ni2P/rGO). The size-controlled synthesis of ultrasmall metal-based catalysts is of vital economic interest and scientific importance for chemical conversion technologies. The Ni2P/rGO guarantees large active surface area and perfect dispersity of the active sites with ultrasmall particle sizes (average about 2.6 nm), which can serve as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. In 1.0 M KOH, the Ni2P/rGO exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic performance for both HER and OER, affording a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 142 mV for HER and 260 mV for OER with small Tafel slope. Furthermore, an electrolyzer employed with Ni2P/rGO as a bifunctional catalyst in both the cathode and anode in 1.0 M KOH generated 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.61 V with excellent stability, comparable to the integrated Pt/C and RuO2 counterparts, which is among the best performances of transition metal phosphides (TMPs).									127	11	0	0	1	0	128			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000423466100037

To reduce the rate of photogenerated carriers' recombination and chemically corrosion of CdS photoanode, a composite component surface state passivation layer was introduced. The polydopamine (PDA) and Nafion co-modified CdS nanorods were successfully prepared by simple electropolymerization and dipping methods. The inherent adhesion of PDA can make it adhere well to CdS nanorods to improve the surface defects of CdS, and it can also promote the assembly of Nafion coating. The mechanism of PDA/Nafion bi-layer passivation on CdS was analyzed by steady-state/time-resolved photoluminescence spectra and electron paramagnetic resonance. The optimized CdS/PDA/Nafion photoanode exhibits highly improved PEC water splitting activity and stability under visible light. It is highly anticipated that this multifunctional polymer passivation layer will provide new routes to practically engineer photoanodes in PEC hydrogen production devices.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000714931100001

The optimal physicochemical conditions for the synthesis of the materials from citrate precursors at low temperature were studied through gravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TGA-DTA). X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron microscopy (SEM-TEM) characterization of the calcined oxides confirmed the formation of a single perovskite-type structure in all the materials. The incorporation of cobalt into the structure was associated with an evolution from a rhombohedral R3-c to an orthorhombic Pnma 62 structure, with nanometric particle sizes and relevant surface properties. The results obtained from Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) evidenced that the chemical composition and the of the cations were in accordance with the proposed system and the employed synthesis method. The conversion of CO and O-2 was between 83.5 and 100% for all oxides, depending on the cobalt content, and the positive effect of temperature on the conversion and the selectivity for the formation of CO2. Stability tests confirmed a stable conversion of CO and O-2, with high initial values around 96% +/- 0.97, which stabilized at 83.5% +/- 0.87 for the less reactive materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2510-1560	2510-1579		WOS:000624384300001

The Ni-Fe foam (NFF) is pretreated by a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma under ambient conditions, resulting in numerous microtrenches on the NFF surface. Meanwhile, some NiO and Fe2O3 spots appear on the NFF foam upon exposure to hot filaments generated in DBD plasmas in air. Cross linked 3D CoS/Ni3S2-FeS nanopetals emerge on plasma treated NFF surface (PNFF) through sulfurization of Co nanosheets electrodeposited on PNFF. The produced CoS/Ni3S2-FeS/PNFF nanocomposite exhibited high electrocatalytic activity and stability for the overall water splitting. Benefiting from the 3D hierarchical nanoarchitecture of CoS/Ni3S2-FeS/PNFF with a large surface area, fast electron transport, and low free energy for adsorption, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is achieved for the HER and OER with ultralow overpotentials of 75 mV and 136 mV, respectively. The amounts of H-2 and O-2 produced at a normalized current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH are about 680 mu mol h(-1) and 1230 mu mol h(-1), respectively. These values are very competitive compared with the state-of-the-art results reported for noble metal-free electrodes in alkaline media.									42	0	0	0	1	0	42			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000434748000029

The UiO-66-NH2/wood membrane showed excellent removal performance for removing heavy metal ions (Hg2+, Cu2+) in wastewater. The results showed that the removal efficiency for tested heavy metal ions (Hg2+, Cu2+) is more than 90.0% at the treatment rate of 1.0x10(2) L . m(-2) . h(-1). Wood membrane, as a 3D substrate for anchoring UiO-66-NH, nanoparticles, contains numerous elongated and open lumens along the growth direction. On the one hand, it can enhance the water of including heavy metal ions fluxes; on the other hand, it can increase the contact probability of heavy metal ion containments with UiO-66-NH2 MOFs as water flowing through the membrane. Therefore, the UiO-66-NH2/wood membrane can efficiently remove trace heavy metal ions from the water. In addition, the UiO-66-NH2/wood membrane also has good reusability, which is expected to be applied in practical applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0251-0790			WOS:000800317700002

Inter alia, it demonstrates that the core proteins of PSI, PsaA and PsaB each consist of an N-terminal antenna-binding domain, and a C-terminal reaction center (RC)-domain. A comparison of the RC-domain of PSI and the photosynthetic RC of purple bacteria (PbRC), reveals significantly analogous structures. This provides the structural support for the hypothesis that the two RC-types (I and II) share a common evolutionary origin. Apart from a similar set of constituent cofactors of the electron transfer system, the analogous features include a comparable cofactor arrangement and a corresponding secondary structure motif of the PC-cores. Despite these analogies, significant differences are evident, particularly as regards the distances between and the orientation of individual cofactors, and the length and orientation of alpha-helices. Inferred roles of conserved amino acids are discussed for PSI, photosystem II (PSII), photosystem C (PSC, green sulfur bacteria) and photosystem H (PSH, heliobacteria). Significant sequence homology between the N-terminal, antenna-binding domains of the core proteins of type-I RCs, PsaA, PsaB, PscA and PshA (of PSI, PSC and PSH respectively) with the antenna-binding subunits CP43 and CP47 of PSII indicate that PSII has a modular structure comparable to that of PSI.

The efficient and specific electrochemical communication between the redox center and electrodes is crucial to ensure accurate glucose determination. The efficiency of the electron transfer rates (ETR) with GOx, together with quinone diamine based mediators, is low and differs even among mediator derivatives. To design optimized enzyme-mediator couples and to describe a mediator binding model, a joint experimental and computational study was performed based on an oxygen-independent GOx variant V7 and two quinone diimine based electron mediators (QDM-1 and QDM-2), which differ in polarity and size, and ferrocenemethanol (FM). A site saturation library at position 414 was screened with all three mediators and yielded four beneficial substitutions Tyr, Met, Leu, and Val. The variants showed increased mediator activity for the more polar QDM-2 with a simultaneously decreased activity for the less polar and smaller QDM-1 and for FM. The variant GOx V7-I414Y exhibited the biggest change for the quinone diimine derivatives compared with V7 (QDM-1: 55.9U/mg V7, 33.2U/mg V7-I414Y; QDM-2: 2.7U/mg V7, 12.9U/mg V7-I414Y). TheoreticalETR calculated based on the Marcus theory were in good agreement with the experimental results. Molecular docking studies revealed a preferable binding of the two QD mediators directly in the active site, 3.5 angstrom away from the N5 atom of the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and in direct vicinity to position 414. In summary, position 414 in the active site was identified to modulate the electron shuttling from the FAD of the GOx to small water-soluble mediators dependent on the polarity and size of residue 414 and on the polarity and size of the mediator. The presented mediator binding model offers a promising possibility for the design of optimized enzyme-mediator couples.									12	0	0	0	6	0	12			0006-3592	1097-0290		WOS:000447122900002	29959868

However, the effects of fine-scale genetic variation within symbiont populations on host performance are not well understood. Applying quantitative PCR (qPCR) to Pocillopora damicornis colonies from Lord Howe Island (Australia), we estimated the relative abundance of intra-genomically variable (IGV) Symbiodinium cells and those with homogeneous rDNA sequence repeats. We then analysed their physical status and photosynthetic performance at both ambient and extreme summer temperatures (25 and 29 degrees C, respectively) in a closed-system oxygen flux chamber. The proportion of IGV Symbiodinium was negatively correlated with photosynthetic production and efficiency, and under thermal stress, colonies dominated by IGV cells could only meet respiratory demands at high irradiance (> 250 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)). IGV Symbiodinium were also estimated to be 50% larger by volume, occurred at lower density, and had higher chlorophyll c(2)/a ratios. The comparatively poor performance of heterogeneous Symbiodinium cells suggests either a direct deleterious effect of IGV or reduced performance in putative inter-lineage recombinants, whose genomes feature ITS2 variants from both parental ribotypes. While it remains unclear whether the mixed rDNA arrays result from somatic mutation or recombination, our results demonstrate that the beneficial capacity of symbionts can vary within Symbiodinium populations, with potential implications for host fitness.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0722-4028	1432-0975		WOS:000441845500008

In this review, we first elaborated on the fundamental aspects of 2D MoS2 cocatalysts to include the structural design principles, synthesis strategies, strengths and challenges. Subsequently, we thoroughly highlighted and discussed the modification strategies of 2D MoS2 H-2-evolution cocatalysts, including doping heteroatoms (e.g. metals, non-metals, and co-doping), designing interfacial coupling morphologies, controlling the physical properties (e.g. thickness, size, structural defects or pores), exposing the reactive facets or edge sites, constructing co-catalyst heterojunctions, engineering the interfacial bonds and confinement effects. In the future, the forefront challenges in understanding and in precise controlling of the active sites at molecular level or atomic level should be carefully studied, while various potential mechanisms of photogenerated-electrons interactions should be proposed. The applications of MoS2 cocatalyst in the overall water splitting are also expected. This review may offer new inspiration for designing and constructing novel and efficient MoS2-based composite photocatalysts for highly efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

J	Chen, Wei; Liu, Mei; Li, Xiying; Mao, Liqun								Synthesis of 3D mesoporous g-C3N4 for efficient overall water splitting under a Z-scheme photocatalytic system								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				512						145782	10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.145782				MAY 15 2020	2020	Photocatalytic overall water splitting (H-2/O-2 = 2) on graphitic polymeric carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is still a challenge due to the presence of an insufficient number of active sites and the weak oxidative capacity of the valence band towards H2O. Herein, a 3D porous g-C3N4 photocatalyst was prepared by the SiO2 hard template method, and overall water splitting was achieved with a Z-scheme system. With the confinement effect of SiO2, 3D porous g-C3N4 possesses a large specific area and thin walls compared to bulk g-C3N4, which not only provides more active sites but also shortens the charge migration distance, thus enhancing the photocatalytic activity. With a specific surface area of 159.7 m(2).g(-1) and a 12.4 nm pore size, the mesoporous g-C3N4-15 showed the highest H-2 evolution rate, reaching 2.5 (under full-wavelength light lambda > 320 nm) and 4.7 (under visible light lambda > 420 nm) times that of bulk g-C3N4. Under a Z-scheme system where BiVO4 and Fe2+/Fe3+ are used as the O-2 evolution photocatalyst and carrier transfer mediator, respectively, the mesoporous g-C3N4-15 achieved overall water splitting under both full-wavelength (H-2: 81.6 mu mol.h(-1), O-2: 40.4 mu mol.h(-1)) and visible (9.8 mu mol.h(-1) and 4.4 mu mol.h(-1)) light irradiation with 1.8% apparent quantum yield (AQY) at lambda = 420 nm. Besides high photocatalytic activity, the large specific surface area of g-C3N4-15 is beneficial for the adsorption and redox capability of Fe2+/Fe3+, which facilitates the formation of the Z-scheme system and promotes the photocatalytic activity.									25	3	0	0	2	0	25			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000522731700119

High CO2 (mostly > 90%) treatment has been widely used for persimmon fruit deastringency and is controlled by several different transcription factors (DkERFs, DkMYBs and DkTGAs). However, the responses of DkNACs to high CO2 and low oxygen, as well as their regulatory roles in deastringency, are still not fully understood. In the present research, six DkNACs (DkNAC13-18) were isolated from persimmon fruit. Phylogenetic and sequence analyses predicted that DkNAC13/15/18 might be hypoxia-responsive and possibly involved in regulating the persimmon deastringency, according to the functions of their putative homologs. Gene expression analysis indicated that DkNACs 13-18 were all regulated by artificial high-CO2 atmosphere (1% O-2 and 95% CO2, AHCA), with DkNACs 13-17 being up-regulated and DkNAC18 down-regulated. Dual-luciferase assay further indicated that DkNAC13 significantly activated the promoter of DkERF9 (an activator of DkPDC2), meanwhile, DkNAC16 acted as an activator of a deastringency related structural gene (DkADH1). Thus, the present study indicated six high-CO2/hypoxia- modulated DkNAC genes, with at least two novel DkNAC genes (DkNAC13/16) were characterized as putative activators for deastringency, acting on DkERF9 and DkADH1 respectively.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			0304-4238	1879-1018		WOS:000467513900025

To remove impurities such as carbon and oxygen in as-deposited films, a N-2/H-2 in situ plasma treatment (IPT) is usually applied. In this paper, transmission electronic microscopy analysis and electrical tests were carried to study the properties of MOCVD TiN thin films in real structures, especially under different conditions of IPT and film thickness. IPT efficiency was proved to be significantly higher at horizontal planes than vertical planes due to the plasma motion perpendicular to wafer surface. This leads to an obvious difference of film thickness and structure at different locations in real structures. It was also found that IPT efficiency is sensitive with via size and aspect ratio in our electrical properties study. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Bands of (CO)-C-12-O-16 also are present, but no bands of (CO)-C-13-O-16 or (CO)-C-12-O-17 are seen. We estimate an isotopic ratio O-16/O-18 less than or similar to 1. The solar value of this ratio is similar to 500. Neither He-core burning nor He-shell flash burning can produce the isotopic ratios of oxygen and carbon observed in HD 137613. However, a remarkable similarity exists between the observed abundances and those found in the outer layers of the broad He shell of early - asymptotic giant branch ( AGB) stars, soon after the end of He-core burning. It is not known how the outer envelope down to the He shell could be lost, but some mechanism of enhanced mass loss must be involved. HD 137613 may be a post - early-AGB star with the outer layers of the former He-burning shell as its photosphere. The unusual elemental abundances of the HdC stars resemble those of the R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars, but HdC stars do not produce clouds of dust that produce declines in brightness. None of the other RCB or HdC stars observed show significant O-18.									39	0	0	0	0	0	39			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000228445600020		
J	Tiwari, Prerna; Tsekouras, George; Swiegers, Gerhard F.; Wallace, Gordon G.				Wallace, Gordon G/H-1123-2011	Wallace, Gordon G/0000-0002-0381-7273; Swiegers, Gerhard/0000-0002-4713-6090			Gortex-Based Gas Diffusion Electrodes with Unprecedented Resistance to Flooding and Leaking								ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES				10	33			28176	28186		10.1021/acsami.8b05358				AUG 22 2018	2018	A significant and long-standing problem in electrochemistry has demanded the need for gas diffusion electrodes that are "flood-proof" and "leak-proof" when operated with a liquid electrolyte. The absence of a solution to this problem has, effectively, made it unviable to use gas diffusion electrodes in many electrochemical manufacturing processes, especially as "gas-depolarized" counter electrodes with significantly decreased energy consumption. In this work, Gortex membranes (also known as expanded PTFE or ePTFE) have been studied as novel, leak-proof substrates for gas diffusion electrodes [PTFE = poly(tetrafluoroethylene)]. We report the fabrication, characterization, and operation of gas diffusion electrodes comprising finely pored Gortex overcoated with 10% Pt on Vulcan XC72, PTFE binder, and a fine Ni mesh as a current carrier. Capillary flow porometry indicated that the electrodes only flooded/leaked when the excess of pressure on their liquid-side over their gas-side was 5.7 atm. This is more than an order of magnitude greater than any previous gas diffusion electrode. The Gortex electrodes were tested as hydrogen- and oxygen-depolarized anodes and cathodes in an alkaline fuel cell in which the liquid electrolyte was pressurized to 0.5-1.5 atm above the gas pressures. Despite the record high electrolyte pressure, the electrodes, which had Pt loadings of only 0.075 mg Pt/cm(2), exhibited notable activity over 2 d of continuous, leak-free operation. Under the applied liquid pressure, the fuel cell also overcame all of the key technical challenges that have hindered the adoption of alkaline fuel cells to date. The high activity and unprecedented resistance to leaking/flooding exhibited by these electrodes, even when subjected to large liquid electrolyte overpressures under gas depolarization conditions, provide an important advance with far-reaching implications for electrochemical manufacturing.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1944-8244			WOS:000442706600067	30052032	
J	Ghosh, Dulal C.; Chakraborty, Arindam								Dipole correlation of the electronic structures of the conformations of water molecule evolving through the normal modes of vibrations between angular (C-2v) to linear (D-proportional to h) shapes								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES				7	3			71	96		10.3390/i7030071				MAR 2006	2006	In order to settle the issue of equivalence or non-equivalence of the two lone pairs of electrons on oxygen atom in water molecule, a quantum chemical study of the dipole correlation of the electronic structure of the molecule as a function of conformations generated following the normal modes of vibrations between the two extreme conformations, C-2v (angle HOH at 90 degrees) and D-proportional to h (angle HOH at 180 degrees), including the equilibrium one, has been performed. The study invokes quantum mechanical partitioning of molecular dipoles into bond moment and lone pair moment and localization of delocalized canonical molecular orbitals, CMO's into localized molecular orbitals, LMO's. An earlier suggestion, on the basis of photoelectron spectroscopy, that one lone pair is in p-type and the other is in s-type orbital of O atom of water molecule at its equilibrium shape, and also the qualitative "Squirrel Ears" structure are brought under serious scrutiny. A large number of conformations are generated and the charge density matrix, dipole moment of each conformation is computed in terms of the generated canonical molecular orbitals, CMO's and then Sinanoglu's localization method is invoked to localize the CMO's of each conformation and the quantum mechanical hybridizations of all the bonds and lone pairs on O center are evaluated in terms of the localized molecular orbitals. Computed data demonstrate that the electronic structures i.e. two bond pairs and two lone pairs and its hybridization status of all conformations of water molecule are straightforward in terms of the LMO's. It is further revealed that the pattern of orbital hybridization changes continuously as a function of evolution of molecular shape. The close analysis of the generated LMO's reveals that one lone pair is accommodated in a pure p orbital and another lone pair is in a hybrid orbital in almost all conformations. One more important result of the present study is that, with the physical process of structural evolution from close angular shape to the linear transition state, the length of the sigma (O-H) decreases and its strength increases as a monotone function of reaction coordinates. The bond length is shortest and the strength is largest at the transition state of structural inversion. Result of structural effect of the present study during the evolution of molecular conformations is quite consistent with the result of a very refined calculation that one physically significant feature of force field that the stretching force constants at the linear geometry are considerably larger than their equilibrium counter parts. The variation of bond strength and the hybridization of s and p orbitals on O atom center to form the sigma (O-H) bond as a function of evolution of conformations is in accordance with Coulson's prediction. The total dipole moment of all conformations is partitioned into the contribution from bonds and lone pairs and correlated in terms of the computed hybridization in lone pairs. The analysis of the variation of dipole moment as a function of angular to linear structural evolution reveals that the dipole moment of H2O molecule is not due to the bond moments only but a significant contribution comes from a lone pair. It is strongly established that the dipole moment of water molecule at and around the equilibrium geometry is not due to the bond moments only and the major part of the molecular dipole comes from the contribution of lone pair electrons.This necessitates the accommodation of a lone pair of electrons in a hybid orbital on O atom. The computed LMO's webbed with partitioned molecular dipole reveal that one lone pair is in a pure p-type orbital and the other lone pair is in a hybrid of s and p, and not in a pure s type orbital as suggested on the basis of photoelectron spectra. The possibility of qualitative "Squirrel Ears" structure is also ruled out. The problem of equivalence or non-equivalence of the two lone pairs of the O atom in water seems to have been finally resolved by the present quantum chemical calculation. An attempt of locating the origin of barrier to the physical process of inversion of water molecule is made in terms of energy partitioning method. It is found that the dipole can be used as a descriptor for the elucidation of electronic structure of molecules.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				1422-0067		WOS:000237727000001

Structural characterizations reveal that the intrinsic structure of Co/N-C-Zn in terms of its morphology, pore structure and defects have been greatly modulated by such a surface treatment, resulting in a higher loading amount of metallic Co, larger surface area and increased pyridinic N and Co-N species as efficient active sites. Benefiting from the structural modulation, Co/N-C-Zn exhibits outstanding ORR activity and kinetics with a positive half-wave potential of 0.88 V vs. RHE, a high kinetic current density (J(k)) value of 36.6 mA cm(-2) at 0.85 V vs. RHE, and a small Tafel slope of 55.9 mV dec(-1), which even outperforms commercial Pt/C. Moreover, enhanced OER performance is also achieved in Co/N-C-Zn with an overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), surpasses that of commercial RuO2 (295 mV). Finally, Co/N-Czr, shows promise for substitution of commercial Pt/C and RuO2 to drive both liquid and solid-state rechargeable Zn-air batteries with high peak power densities of 196 mW cm(-2) and 130 mW cm(-2).									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000608525800007

Gaseous hydrogen was produced at the cathode and oxygen at the anode. The voltage measured at the cathode relative to the solution, and that across both electrodes was found to be dependent on the cathode material used, specifically the substrate material and the density and nature of a RuO2 nanorod coating. The formation of a double layer on the nanorod surface was proposed to render the production rate of hydrogen, dependent on total interfacial area alone and not on the geometric shape of the nanorods themselves. At a current density of 20 mA/cm(2), the operating efficiency of the RuO2 nanorod cathode cell was found to be 1.7 times that obtained for a cathode electrode fabricated with a simple thin film of RuO2.

To do so we take into account the chemical yields obtained from homogeneous evolutionary calculations of zero-metal stars in the mass range 3 less than or similar to m/M. less than or similar to 40 (Limongi et al.; Chieffi et al.). We also consider the role played by metal-free very massive objects (m > 100 M.). Using both analytical and numerical chemical evolution models, we confront model predictions from the different choices of the mass function proposed for Population III with the observational constraints. We show that low values of star formation efficiency (< 1%) are required so as not to exceed the minimum metallicity ([C/H] <approximate to> -2.4) measured in the high-redshift systems for any of the initial mass functions (IMFs) proposed. We also show that the observational constraints require Omega (sr) < 3 x 10(-3)<Omega>(b), confirming previous claims that the possible contribution of the stellar remnants from Population III to the baryonic dark matter is insignificant. At present, however, the scarcity of abundance measurements for high-redshift systems does not permit us to put severe limitations on the nature of the initial mass function for Population III. In fact, overabundances of a-elements with respect to iron of the order of those measured in damped Ly alpha systems are obtained for any of the IMFs tested. Nevertheless, to account for the very large [C, N/Fe] ratios found in a considerable number of extremely metal-poor stars of our Galaxy, an IMF peaking at the intermediate stellar mass range (4-8 M.) is needed.									39	0	0	0	0	0	39			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000170558100012

In this study, SpDUOX1 and SpDUOX2 of mud crab (Scylla paramamosain) were identified and studied. Both SpDUOX1 and SpDUOX2 are transmembrane proteins, including an N-signal peptide region and a peroxidase homology domain in the extracellular region, transmembrane regions, and three EF (calcium-binding region) domains, a FAD-binding domain, and a NAD binding domain in the intracellular region. The SpDUOXs were expressed in all tissues examined, but mainly in hepatopancreas, heart, and mid-intestine. The expression of the SpDUOXs in the hemolymph of mud crabs was up-regulated after challenge with Vibrio parahemolyticus or LPS. RNA interference (RNAi) of the SpDUOXs resulted in reduced ROS production in hemolymph. The bacterial count increased in the hemolymph of mud crabs injected with SpDUOX1 or SpDUOX2-RNAi, while the bacterial clearance ability of hemolymph significantly reduced. At the phylum level, the phyla Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were significantly increased, while Proteobacteria were significantly reduced following SpDUOX2 knockdown. There was a significant increase in the relative abundance of the genera Marinomonas, Pseudoalteromonas, Shewanella, and Hydrogenoph in SpDUOX2 depleted mud crabs compared with the controls. Our current findings therefore indicated that SpDUOXs might play important roles in maintaining the homeostasis in the hemolymph microbiota of mud crab.									11	0	0	0	9	0	11			0145-305X	1879-0089		WOS:000444932200013	30107250

In this study, the p38 MAPK gene (designated as Spp38) of mud crab (Scylla paramamosain) was identified and studied. Spp38 contained the conserved Thr-Gly-Tyr (TGY) motif and a Ala-Thr-Arg-Trp (ATRW) substrate-binding site. Spp38 transcript was ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined, with the highest expression found in muscle and hepatopancras. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that Spp38 was upregulated in hemocytes and hepatopancras after infection with Vibrio parahemolyticus and Llpopolysaccharides (LPS). Reporter gene assays indicated that Spp38 activated the expression of anti-lipopolysaccharides (SpALF1 - SpALF6) in S. paramarnosian. RNA interference (MAD mediated knockdown of Spp38 or inhibition of Spp38 by SB203580 decreased the expression levels of SpALF1-6 and dual oxidase (SpDuox1 and SpDuox2) in S. paramamosian, which consequently reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production thereby significantly increasing the bacterial count in the hemolymph of mud crabs. Similarly, there was a significant reduction in bacterial clearance ability of hemolymph after Spp38 knockdown followed by V. parahemolyticus infection. Taken together, the current data indicated that Spp38 could play a vital role in maintaining the homeostasis of hemolymph microbiota in S. paramamosain.									9	0	0	0	8	0	9			0145-305X	1879-0089		WOS:000462107900005	30738078	
J	Percival, Stephen J.; Zhang, Bo				Zhang, Bo/AAI-8855-2021				Study of the Formation and Quick Growth of Thick Oxide Films Using Platinum Nanoelectrodes as a Model Electrocatalyst								LANGMUIR				30	37			11235	11242		10.1021/la502336e				SEP 23 2014	2014	We report a study of the formation and quick growth of thick films of platinum oxide on platinum nanoelectrodes at low anodic potentials. Here, structurally well-defined platinum nanoelectrodes are used as a model platform for nanoscale platinum electrocatalysts. Platinum films are formed on the surface of the nanoelectrode upon application of a constant anodic potential in an acidic environment for an extended time period. A current spike is initially observed, which is attributed to capacitance charging, the oxidation of water, and the initial oxidation of the platinum surface. A finite residual current follows the initial current spike, which is composed of both water oxidation and the oxidation of platinum metal concealed beneath the growing oxide layer. These films are observed to be structurally irreversible, grow to be relatively thick, and protrude out of the glass insulating material encasing the nanoelectrode due to the added volume of the oxygen incorporated into the growing platinum oxide film. Once reduced, the platinum metal remains protruding out of the glass, and its presence is confirmed by both SEM imaging and cyclic voltammetry. Steady-state voltammetric data shows a finite increase in the diffusion-limited faradaic current of the nanoelectrode, relative to the initial steady-state current, after the oxidation/reduction of the platinum which is due to an increased area of the protruding platinum metal. A minimum apparent rate of similar to 1.2 nm/min can be calculated for the growth of the platinum oxide film. The use of platinum nanoelectrodes has shown several distinct advantages in this study, including better control of the size and morphology of the individual electrocatalysts, the ability to image using electron microscopy, and the ability to use voltammetry to evaluate the geometry of the electrode quickly.									13	1	0	0	1	0	13			0743-7463			WOS:000342184600031	25162785

The data were acquired by NanoSIMS ion imaging with the new Hyperion ion source that permits Mg and Si isotope measurements of presolar silicates with higher precision than was possible before. For a subset of five Group 1 ("category A") grains, Mg-25/Mg-24 and Si-29/Si-28 ratios correlate with the inferred initial O-18/O-16 ratios of their parent stars, a measure of stellar metallicity. The Mg and Si isotope data of category A grains show positive correlations in the delta Mg-25-delta Mg-26, delta Si-29-delta Si-30, and delta Mg-25-delta Si-29 spaces. The correlations between O-, Mg, and Si-isotopic compositions are best explained by Galactic chemical evolution (GCE), with only minor imprints of nucleosynthetic and mixing processes in the grains' parent stars. Six Group 1 silicate ("category B") grains have close-to-normal Mg and Si isotopic compositions, possibly the result of isotope exchange in interstellar space or the meteorite parent bodies. For Si in category A grains, we find, with similar to 2 sigma significance, a slightly shallower slope in the delta Si-29-delta Si-30 space for the GCE than inferred from presolar SiC mainstream grains. The 2 sigma upper limit on the slope for the linear trend in the delta Mg-25-delta Mg-26 space of category A grains is slightly lower than the slope-1 predicted by GCE models around solar metallicity.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000452893300003

Herein, a hierarchical dendritic Ag catalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction is prepared through pulse electrodeposition onto functionalized carbon paper. To gain the hydrophilicity required for contact with the deposition electrolyte, carbon paper is acid-treated to induce oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface. Among the acids tested, H2SO4 significantly enhances the morphological characteristics, such as population and size, of Ag clusters during pulse electrodeposition. This leads to lower charge transfer resistance and 1.6 times higher current density for CO production during CO2 electrolysis in a bath-type cell than those for Ag on pristine carbon paper. This superior activity is maintained in a membrane-electrode-assembly-type cell employing a proton-exchange membrane, which is desirable for mass production of CO. Thus, pulse electrodeposition of Ag onto H2SO4-treated carbon paper is a beneficial strategy to fabricate an electrode for a high-performance proton-exchange membrane CO2 electrolyzer.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000486355400041

Geobiotropy.								ORIGINS OF LIFE AND EVOLUTION OF BIOSPHERES				47	4			453	480		10.1007/s11084-017-9534-5				DEC 2017	2017	In this article, anoxic and oxic hydrolyses of rocks containing Fe (II) Mg-silicates and Fe (II)-monosulfides are analyzed at 25 A degrees C and 250-350 A degrees C. A table of the products is drawn. It is shown that magnetite and hydrogen can be produced during low-temperature (25 A degrees C) anoxic hydrolysis/oxidation of ferrous silicates and during high-temperature (250 A degrees C) anoxic hydrolysis/oxidation of ferrous monosulfides. The high-T (350 A degrees C) anoxic hydrolysis of ferrous silicates leads mainly to ferric oxides/hydroxides such as the hydroxide ferric trihydroxide, the oxide hydroxide goethite/lepidocrocite and the oxide hematite, and to Fe(III)-phyllosilicates. Magnetite is not a primary product. While the low-T (25 A degrees C) anoxic hydrolysis of ferrous monosulfides leads to pyrite. Thermodynamic functions are calculated for elementary reactions of hydrolysis and carbonation of olivine and pyroxene and E-pH diagrams are analyzed. It is shown that the hydrolysis of the iron endmember is endothermic and can proceed within the exothermic hydrolysis of the magnesium endmember and also within the exothermic reactions of carbonations. The distinction between three products of the iron hydrolysis, magnetite, goethite and hematite is determined with E-pH diagrams. The hydrolysis/oxidation of the sulfides mackinawite/troilite/pyrrhotite is highly endothermic but can proceed within the heat produced by the exothermic hydrolyses and carbonations of ferromagnesian silicates and also by other sources such as magma, hydrothermal sources, impacts. These theoretical results are confirmed by the products observed in several related laboratory experiments. The case of radiolyzed water is studied. It is shown that magnetite and ferric oxides/hydroxides such as ferric trihydroxide, goethite/lepidocrocite and hematite are formed in oxic hydrolysis of ferromagnesian silicates at 25 A degrees C and 350 A degrees C. Oxic oxidation of ferrous monosulfides at 25 A degrees C leads mainly to pyrite and ferric oxides/hydroxides such as ferric trihydroxide, goethite/lepidocrocite and hematite and also to sulfates, and at 250 A degrees C mainly to magnetite instead of pyrite, associated to the same ferric oxides/hydroxides and sulfates. Some examples of geological terrains, such as Mawrth Vallis on Mars, the Tagish Lake meteorite and hydrothermal venting fields, where hydrolysis/oxidation of ferromagnesian silicates and iron(II)-monosulfides may occur, are discussed. Considering the evolution of rocks during their interaction with water, in the absence of oxygen and in radiolyzed water, with hydrothermal release of H-2 and the plausible associated formation of components of life, geobiotropic signatures are proposed.

The recently discovered benzoate oxidation pathway in Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 encodes a novel such ring-cleaving enzyme, termed BoxC, that catalyzes the conversion of 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-CoA to 3,4-dehydroadipyl-CoA without the requirement for molecular oxygen. Sequence analysis indicates that BoxC is a highly divergent member of the crotonase superfamily and nearly double the size of the average superfamily member. The structure of BoxC determined to 1.5 angstrom resolution reveals an intriguing structural demarcation. A highly divergent region in the C terminus probably serves as a structural scaffold for the conserved N terminus that encompasses the active site and, in conjunction with a conserved C-terminal helix, mediates dimer formation. Isothermal titration calorimetry and molecular docking simulations contribute to a detailed view of the active site, resulting in a compelling mechanistic model where a pair of conserved glutamate residues (Glu146 and Glu168) work in tandem to deprotonate the dihydroxylated ring substrate, leading to cleavage. A final deformylation step incorporating a water molecule and Cys(111) as a general base completes the formation of 3,4-dehydroadipyl-CoA product. Overall, this study establishes the basis for BoxC as one of the most divergent members of the crotonase superfamily and provides the first structural insight into the mechanism of this novel class of ring-cleaving enzymes.									10	0	0	0	10	0	11				1083-351X		WOS:000266730900035	19369256

Our understanding of global redox conditions remains in its infancy, and redox data derived from the Mesoproterozoic thus far indicate heterogeneity and complexity in the realm of ocean redox, which hampers our understanding of the potential significance of variations in ocean redox on eukaryote evolution. In this study, we report analyses of Fe species and redox-sensitive trace metals of U and Mo from the Jixian Group, including the Wumishan, Hongshuizhuang and Tieling formations, as well as the Xiamaling Formation, in the Yanshan Basin in North China. The Fe speciation data from the Wumishan, Hongshuizhuang, and Tieling formations first reported in this study help bridge the global data gap of Fe species data during 1500-1400 Ma. Our data suggest likely oxic bottom water conditions for the Wumishan Formation and ferruginous bottom water conditions for the Tieling Formation. The Fe species data can distinguish ferruginous conditions for the upper Hongshuizhuang from sulfidic depositional conditions for the lower-middle Hongshuizhuang Formation. Based on Fe species and trace metal data, redox conditions likely varied from anoxic conditions with transient euxinia in the lower-middle Xiamaling Formation to oxic conditions in the upper Xiamaling Formation. The new Fe speciation data from the Yanshan Basin, when combined with previously published data, show a surprisingly high proportion of middle Proterozoic samples with very low highly reactive to total iron ratios. This suggests either a relatively large extent of oxic seafloor, or non-uniformitarian iron cycling. Resolving this discrepancy will be key to understanding the extent of suitable habitats for complex eukaryotes.									8	3	0	0	1	0	9			0301-9268	1872-7433		WOS:000561218200020

There are two types of CuZnSOD and MnSOD in cells. In this study, the cloning and tissue distribution of icCuZnSOD (SOD-1) and (SOD-2) in Trachinotus blochii were studied by RACE and RT-qPCR. The studies showed that the ORF of SOD-1 (icCuZnSOD) was 486 bp and encoded 161 amino acids with a molecular weight of 16.676 kD, and SOD-1 had no signal peptide but had a SOD-CU protein domain. The ORF of SOD-2 (mMnSOD) was 657 bp and encoded 218 amino acids with a molecular weight of 24.261 kD, and SOD-2 also had no signal peptide with a SOD-FE protein domain. By homologous alignment of amino acid sequences, a different peptide fragment was found in SOD-1 that contains Arg-Asn-Ser-Ala-Cys-Gln-Ile. It was found that SOD-1 was closely related to Epinephelus coioides and Epinephelus malabaricus, and SOD-2 was closely related to Seriola dumerili and forms its own branch. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that the expression of SOD-1 and SOD-2 was the highest in the heart and liver, followed by relatively high expression in the brain and gill. It indicated that SOD-1 and SOD-2 may be involved in immune epidemic prevention and maintaining metabolism. This study lays a theoretical foundation for the study of the stress resistance and immune of Trachinostus blochii in the future.			超氧化物歧化酶(SOD)是通过歧化反应催化超氧化物转化为O_2和H_2O_2的酶,铜锌超氧化物歧化酶(CuZnSOD)和锰超氧化物歧化酶(MnSOD)是两种主要存在形式。本研究通过RACE法和RT-qPCR技术对布氏鲳鲹(Trachinotus blochii)的SOD-1、SOD-2进行基因克隆、序列分析和组织分布的研究。结果显示,布氏鲳鲹SOD-1(icCuZnSOD)基因的ORF长486 bp,编码161个氨基酸,分子量为16.676 kD,蛋白结构预测无信号肽,含有1个SOD-CU结构域。布氏鲳鲹SOD-2(mMnSOD)基因的ORF长657bp,编码218个氨基酸,分子量为24.261 kD,蛋白结构预测无信号肽,含有1个SOD-FE蛋白结构域。氨基酸序列同源比对结果表明,布氏鲳鲹SOD-1有1段与其他鱼类显著差异的精氨酸-天冬酰胺-丝氨酸-丙氨酸-半胱氨酸-谷氨酰胺-异亮氨酸序列,且与鲈形目点带石斑鱼(Epinephelus coioides)、斜带石斑鱼(Epinephelus malabaricus) CuZnSOD同源性较高;SOD-2与鲈形目的红甘鲹(Seriola dumerili) MnSOD同源性较高且聚为一支。组织分布结果表明,SOD-1和SOD-2在布氏鲳鲹的心脏和肝脏中表达量最高,其次在脑和鳃表达量相对较高,表明SOD-1和SOD-2可能在免疫反应和维持新陈代谢方面有重要作用。本研究为今后布氏鲳鲹的抗逆、免疫的研究提供了研究依据。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1674-568X			CSCD:7137132

In this study, we have successfully synthesized a variety of Ni0.5Cu0.5Co2O4 nanocomposites with different morphology, including nanoplatelets, nanoparticles, and urchin-like microspheres. The catalytic performance of those Ni0.5Cu0.5Co2O4 composites in AB hydrolysis is investigated. The Ni0.5Cu0.5Co2O4 nanoplatelets show the best catalytic performance despite having the smallest specific surface area, with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 80.2 mol(hydrogen).min(-1).mol(cat)(-1). The results reveal that, in contrast to the Ni0.5Cu0.5Co2O4 nanoparticles and microspheres, the Ni0.5Cu0.5Co2O4 nanoplatelets are more readily reduced, leading to the fast formation of active species for AB hydrolysis. These findings provide some insight into the design of high-performance oxide-based catalysts for AB hydrolysis. Considering their low cost and high catalytic activity, Ni0.5Cu0.5Co2O4 nanoplatelets are a strong candidate catalyst for the production of hydrogen through AB hydrolysis in practical applications.									12	1	0	0	1	0	13				2079-4991		WOS:000489101900151	31540373

The critical components of SOFC include anode, electrolyte, and cathode. However, for a stack of individual SOFCs, the evaluation of sealants and interconnects are also essential. In this review article, material selection, fundamentals of operation and underlying mechanisms, processing, microstructural and phase characterization, and the functionality and performance of individual SOFC components are presented in detail. The major challenges and complexity in functional section of SOFC include: (i) poisoning via sulfur and coke deposition, surface diffusion of adsorbate, and charge transfer at triple-phase boundary (TPB) in anode, (ii) hindered O-2(-) migration that converts chemical energy into electrical energy in the solid electrolyte (thus, the creation of ion transfer channels, ease of O-2(-) migration, dissociation of vacancy around dopants, straining of lattice, and other factors such as control of phase and its distribution, grain and grain boundary conductivity, become critical in designing the electrolytes for SOFCs), (iii) multiple rate determining factors such as geometry of active surfaces, and existence of overpotential, in cathode (thereby, comprehensive electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is required for the analysis of solid cathodes in SOFC), (iv) chemical incompatibility and instability in both oxidizing and reducing environments while matching the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) in the interconnects in order to sustain large number of thermal cycling during the operation of SOFC, and (v) isolation of the fuel and oxidizing gases while matching the CfE of the anode, cathode and interconnects, using sealant. Moreover, the glass-transition of sealant dictates the maximum allowable working temperature of SOFC. Thus, the necessitated temporal progress in material selection along with a detailed insight into the conceptual role of thermodynamics and kinetics of surface/cell reactions, effect of phases and microstructure on conductivity, fuel flexibility and deterioration in performance of individual fuel cell components, and evolution of new materials are coherently presented. This article provides a comprehensive review with respect to the structure, chemistry, design and selection of materials, underlying mechanisms, and performance of each SOFC component, and it opens up the future directions towards pursuing SOFC research.

The novel two-step synthesis strategy simultaneously considered the recyclability and high surface-to-volume (S/V) ratio of ZNT arrays used as the photocatalyst. Thus, the ZNT photocatalyst in the form of immobilized films was facilely reusable with little loss in degradation of methyl orange (MO). Further investigation on surface nanofeature and surface defect of as-synthesized ZNT arrays indicated that in comparison with the ZNR arrays, the higher photocatalytic activity of the ZNT arrays could not only be ascribed to a larger S/V ratio that allowed more organic substances to adsorbed to the surfaces of the catalyst, but also be related to the larger content of surface oxygen defects as revealed by photoluminescence (PL) spectra that may act as the active centers of the catalysts and capture the photogenerated electrons or holes, decreasing the recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes. Our synthesis strategy highly paid attention to both the recyclability and biology safety issue that was induced by the discharge of nanoscale materials to natural environment. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Singletary, S; Grove, TL				Grove, Timothy/M-9638-2013	Grove, Timothy/0000-0003-0628-1969			Experimental constraints on ureilite petrogenesis								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				70	5			1291	1308		10.1016/j.gca.2005.10.034				MAR 1 2006	2006	This experimental study explores the petrogenesis of ureilites by a partial melting/smelting process. Experiments have been performed over temperature (1150-1280 degrees C), pressure (5-12.5 MPa), and low oxygen fugacity (graphite-CO gas) conditions appropriate for a hypothetical ureilite parent body similar to 200 km in size. Experimental and modeling results indicate that a partial melting/smelting model of ureilite petrogenesis can explain many of the unique characteristics displayed by this meteorite group. Compositional information preserved in the pigeonite-olivine ureilites was used to estimate the composition of melts in equilibrium with the ureilites. The results of 20 experiments saturated with olivin,, pyroxene, metal, and liquid with appropriate ureilite compositions are used to calibrate the phase coefficients and pressure-temperature dependence of the smelting reaction. The calibrated coefficients are used to model the behavior of a hypothetical residue that is, experiencing fractional smelting. The residue is initially olivine-rich and smelting progressively depletes the olivine content and enriches the pyroxene and metal contents of the residues. The modeled residue composition at 1260 degrees C best reproduces the trend of ureilite bulk compositions. The model results also indicate that as a ureilite residue undergoes isothermal decompression smelting over a range of temperatures, Ca/Al values and Cr2O3 contents are enriched at lower temperatures (below similar to 1240 degrees C) and tend to decrease at higher temperatures. Therefore, fractional smelting can account for the high Ca/Al and Cr2O3 wt% values observed in ureilites. We propose that ureilites were generated from an olivine-rich, cpx-bearing residue. Smelting began when the residue was partially melted and contained liquid, olivine, and carbon. These residues experienced varying degrees of fractional smelting to produce the compositional variability observed within the pigeonite-bearing ureilites. Variations in mineral composition, modal proportions, and isotopic signatures are best described by heterogeneous accretion of the ureilite parent body followed by minimal and variable degrees of igneous processing.

The as-prepared MS/A/CN composite was used to photocatalytic degrade TC with PMS presence under visible light irradiation. The MS/A/CN/Vis/PMS system displayed excellent and rapid degradation of tetracycline (TC) due to the synergistic effect of photocatalysis and PMS activation, approximately 98.9% of TC being removal in 50 min. The effects of the contents of Ag deposition and MoS2 coupling and operation parameters including catalysts dosage, PMS concentration, initial pH and natural water on TC degradation efficiency were investigated. Quenching tests and electron paramagnetic resonance measurements (EPR) confirmed that (OH)-O-center dot, O-center dot(2)- and SO4 center dot- are the primary reactive oxygen species MS/A/CN/Vis/PMS system. Meanwhile, the degraded products of TC was determined via gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) testing and the mechanism of enhanced TC degradation in MS/A/CN/Vis/PMS system was proposed. This work will give insight on rapidly and efficiently removing the organic pollutant in water environment.									58	2	0	0	15	0	60			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000523185200036

The hierarchical H-TiO2/CNFs composites possess more exposed surface active sites and offer efficient charge transport paths. NiS quantum dots as excellent electron acceptors and cocatalysts were anchored on the hierarchical H-TiO2/CNFs composites by a wet chemical deposition method. The synergistic effects of the surface defects (oxygen vacancies), NiS cocatalyst, and carbon nanofibers greatly improve charge transfer and separation, increase the accessible surface area and surface donor density of the composites and also extend the photoresponse from the ultraviolet to the visible light region. By taking advantage of these features and because of its unique architecture, the optimal NiS quantum dots-decorated H-TiO2/CNFs composite exhibited a remarkable solar-driven hydrogen generation rate (75.92 mu mol h(-1), 30 mg(-1)) in the absence of a Pt cocatalyst under AM 1.5 irradiation, which is about 12.3 times that of TiO2/CNFs nanostructures.									30	4	0	0	3	0	30			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000426148500054	29431829	
B	Heinig, K.-H.; Schmidt, B.; Strobel, M.; Bernas, H.								Inverse Ostwald ripening and self-organization of nanoclusters due to ion irradiation								Ion Beam Synthesis and Processing of Advanced Materials. Symposium. (Materials Research Society Symposium Proceedings Vol.647)								O14.6.1	12/R9.6.1-12						2001	2001	Under ion irradiation collisional mixing competes with phase separation if the irradiated solid consists of immiscible components. If a component is a chemical compound, there is another competition between the collisional forced chemical dissociation of the compound and its thermally activated reformation. Especially at interfaces between immiscible components, irradiation processes far from thermodynamical equilibrium may lead to new phenomena. If the formation of nanoclusters (NCs) occurs during ion implantation, the phase separation caused by ion implantation induced supersaturation can be superimposed by phenomena caused by collisional mixing. In this contribution it will be studied how collisional mixing during high fluence ion implantation affects NC synthesis and how ion irradiation through a layer of NCs modifies their size and size distribution. Inverse Ostwald ripening of NCs will be predicted theoretically and by kinetic lattice Monte-Carlo simulations. The mathematical treatment of the competition between irradiation induced detachment of atoms from clusters and their thermally activated diffusion leads to a Gibbs-Thomson relation with modified parameters. The predictions have been confirmed by experimental studies of the evolution of Au NCs in SiO2 irradiated by MeV ions. The unusual behavior results from an effective negative capillary length, which will be shown to be the reason for inverse Ostwald ripening. Another new phenomenon to be addressed is self organization of NCs in a delta-layer parallel to the Si/SiO2 interface. Such delta-layers were found when the damage level at the interface was of the order of 1-3 dpa. It will be discussed that the origin of the delta-layer of NCs can be assigned to two different mechanisms: (i) The negative interface energy due to collisional mixing gives rise to the formation of tiny clusters of substrate material in front of the interface, which promotes heteronucleation of the implanted impurities. (ii) Collisional mixing in the SiO2 produces diffusing oxygen, which may be consumed by the Si/SiO2 interface. A thin layer parallel to the interface becomes denuded of diffusing oxygen, which results in a strong pile up of Si excess. This Si excess promotes heteronucleation too. Independent of the dominating mechanism of self-organization of a delta-layer of NCs, its location in SiO2 close to the SiO2/Si interface makes it interesting for nonvolatile memory application.

The Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the contact angle meter were used to characterize the physicochemical properties of the anodes. Additionally, the electrochemical properties and the stability were further studied by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA) measurements and accelerated life test, respectively. These results indicated that Ti/SnO2-Sb-NRs anode possessed SnO2-Sb-NRs which were about 70 nm in width, as well as a better wettability, a lower charge transfer resistance, a larger current at constant potential and a longer lifetime than the conventional Ti/SnO2-Sb anode prepared by pulse electro-deposition. And the existence of direct oxidation on Ti/SnO2-Sb-NRs anode was confirmed. Electrochemical degradation of Acid Red 73 (AR 73) was investigated to study the electro-catalytic oxidation performance of the anodes. And the results showed that SnO2-Sb-NRs remarkably improved the degradation of AR 73, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency and the adsorption capacity on Ti/SnO2-Sb-NRs anode, which was probably due to the synergetic effects of SnO2-Sb-NRs.

Structure and optical characterization by X-ray diffraction, scanning electronic microscopy, transmission electronic microscopy, and UV-Vis diffused reflectance spectroscopy were used to elucidate morphology, structure, and topology of these newly developed materials. The photocatalytic performance of Mo-Ag3PO4 composites toward the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) was investigated, and the results proved that the degradation rate of RhB in Mo-Ag3PO4 composites (the mass ratio percentages of Mo-2(OCOCH3)(4) to AgNO3 were controlled as 1%, S2) was 0.2365 min(-1), which was approximated to 103 and 1.2 times higher than that of Ag2O.MoO3 and bare Ag3PO4, respectively. In the stability study, Mo-Ag3PO4 composite (S2) exhibited no apparent loss of activity after four catalytic usages (92.4% degradation efficiency) compared with Ag3PO4 (45.5% degradation efficiency), which confirmed its stability. The feasibility of this Mo-Ag3PO4 composite (S2) was validated according to its ability to degrade RhB in environmental water samples, which also demonstrated its high photocatalytic activity. Hole and oxygen radicals are the two main reactive species generated photocatalytically in the mechanism from the light irradiation on Mo-Ag3PO4 composite (S2). The enhanced photocatalytic activity of Mo-Ag3PO4 composite (S2) could be attributed to a low electron-hole recombination rate, and highly efficient charge separation. Thus, a sustainable, low-power (merely 0.38 W/cm(2)) water treatment option by visible light was demonstrated.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000505429000009

Chemical analysis and basic metallographic examination of the DSA alloy are necessary. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction are indispensable to examine surface morphology of the DSAs. Open circuit potential measurements in sulphuric acid solution for long periods, and cyclic voltammetry tests to monitor the surface properties of DSA specimens. Potentiodynamic and linear polarisation measurements are interesting to evaluate corrosion rate, active, active-passive and passive behaviours. Galvanostatic study of the DSA simulates the performance in practice. Electrochemical impedance is recommended to study the electrochemical double layer properties and in situ characterisation of the (DSA) oxide layer/electrolyte inter-phase. Sensitivity of the electrochemical noise electrochemical noise technique in situ has been established recently for the detection of spontaneous changes of DSAs during electrowinning. Scanning vibrating electrochemical probe could identify in situ micro localised variation of potential due to passivation or localised corrosion form such as pitting.									6	2	0	0	0	0	7			1066-7857	1753-5557		WOS:000337141100011		
J	Ugwuanyi, J. Obeta; Harvey, Linda M.; McNeil, Brian								Application of thermophilic aerobic digestion in protein enrichment of high strength agricultural waste slurry for animal feed supplementation								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY				81	10			1641	1651		10.1002/jctb.1574				OCT 2006	2006	Thermophilic aerobic digestion (TAD) is a relatively novel waste processing technique with the potential to improve the safety and nutritional value of many agricultural and food industry wastes for use in animal feed supplementation. TAD of model agricultural waste slurry, at soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) load of approximately 8.0 g L-1, was implemented to study the effect of the process on crude protein accretion and waste quality. Digestions were carried out under batch conditions at 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 vvm (volume of air per volume of waste slurry per minute) aeration rates and pH 7.0, and at pH 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 9.5 and without pH regulation at 0.5 vvm, all at 55 degrees C. All reactions were carried out for 156 h using thermophilic populations indigenous to the waste. Digestion at 0.5 and 1.0 vvm led to the greatest degradation of total suspended solids (51.17% and 52.03% respectively) and the highest accretion of crude protein in treated waste (131.28% and 258.94% respectively). Protein content of the digest decreased as digestion pH increased beyond neutral. Slurry soluble protein content decreased with digestion progress, while the ammonium increased early in the process before decreasing progressively. The percentage content of most amino acids in the digest decreased slightly relative to raw waste. The quality of waste protein was comparable with the FAO standard for protein supplement for feed use. Overall, the digested waste was significantly improved relative to the raw waste. With appropriate process optimization TAD has clear potentials for use in the improvement of various wastes for recycling in animal feed.

J	KHOKHLOV, AM								PROPAGATION OF TURBULENT FLAMES IN SUPERNOVAE								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				449	2			695	713		10.1086/176091				AUG 20 1995	1995	Turbulent thermonuclear burning is studied on scales relevant to the explosion of Type Ia supernovae. A scaling law is formulated for turbulent burning in a uniform gravitational field. The steady state turbulent flame speed is D-t = f(alpha)root gL in the regime where the Froude number F = D-l(2)/gL much less than 1; g, L, D-l, and alpha = rho(0)/rho(1) > 1 are the acceleration, characteristic scale of the problem, normal speed of the laminar flame, and ratio of the densities ahead and behind the flame, respectively; and f similar or equal to 1 is a universal function. In this regime, the turbulent flame speed does not depend on the laminar speed D-l and on details of burning on scales much less than L.A flame-capturing technique for modeling turbulent burning is described. It is used to numerically study the transition to turbulence and turbulent flame propagation in three dimensions. The results confirm the scaling law. The self-regulating mechanism underlying the scaling law is discussed.In Type Ia supernovae, steady state burning takes place on scales less than the radius of the flame, where the effects of spherical geometry and expansion are small. Larger scales influenced by these effects need to be resolved explicitly. Direct, ab initio three-dimensional numerical simulations of deflagration in supernovae thus become feasible.Effects of spherical geometry and expansion of matter on the propagation of turbulent flames are discussed. The expansion decreases large-scale turbulent motions and reduces the bulk rate of deflagration in a massive carbon-oxygen white dwarf. Results of a large-scale three-dimensional simulation of the deflagration explosion of a Type Ia supernova are presented.									181	4	0	0	0	0	181			0004-637X			WOS:A1995RP42400028		
J	Venkatesan, A								A cosmic milestone: Constraints from metal-poor halo stars on the cosmological reionization epoch								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				641	2			L81	L84		10.1086/504037				APR 20 2006	2006	Theoretical studies and current observations of the high-redshift intergalactic medium (IGM) indicate that at least two cosmic transitions occur by the time the universe reaches gas metallicities of about 10(-3) Z(circle dot). One is the cosmological reionization of the IGM, and the second is the transition from a primordial to present-day mode of star formation. We quantify this relation through new calculations of the ionizing radiation produced in association with the elements carbon, oxygen, and silicon observed in Galactic metal-poor halo stars, which are likely second-generation objects formed in the wake of primordial supernovae. We demonstrate that sufficient ionizing photons per baryon are created by enrichment levels of [Fe/H] similar to -3 in the environment of metal-poor halo stars that provide the optical depth in the cosmic microwave background of similar to 0.1 detected by WMAP. We show that, on a star-by-star basis, a genuine cosmic milestone in the ionization of the IGM and in the mode of star formation occurred at metallicities of 10(-4) to 10(-3) Z(circle dot) in these halo stars. This provides us with an important ,link in the chain of evidence for metal- free first stars having dominated the process of reionization by Z similar to 6. We conclude that many of the Fe-poor halo stars formed close to the end of or soon after cosmological reionization, making them the ideal probe of the physical conditions under which the transition from first-to second-generation star formation happened in primordial galaxies.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000236819900001

We present here a joint theoretical experimental investigation of electrodeposited amorphous manganese oxides with different catalytic activities toward water oxidation (MnCats). Combining the information content of X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements with the predictive power of ab initio calculations based on density functional theory, we have been able to identify the essential structural and electronic properties of MnCats. We have elucidated (i) the localization and structural connection of Mn(II), Mn(III), and Mn(IV) ions in such amorphous oxides and (ii) the distribution of protons at the MnCat/water interface. Our calculations result in realistic 3D models of the MnCat atomistic texture, formed by the interconnection of small planar Mn-oxo sheets cross-linked through different kinds of defective Mn atoms, isolated or arranged in closed cubane-like units. Essential for the catalytic activity is the presence of undercoordinated Mn(III)O-5 units located at the boundary of the amorphous network, where they are ready to act as hole traps that trigger the oxidation of neighboring water molecules when the catalyst is exposed to an external positive potential. The present validation of a sound 3D model of MnCat improves the accuracy of XAFS fits and opens the way for the development of mechanistic schemes of its functioning beyond a speculative level.									32	0	0	0	5	0	32			0002-7863			WOS:000359962000046	26226190	
J	Shalev, N.; Burg, A.; Gavrieli, I.; Lazar, B.					Lazar, Boaz/0000-0002-2304-8993			Nitrate contamination sources in aquifers underlying cultivated fields in an arid region - The Arava Valley, Israel								APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY				63				322	332		10.1016/j.apgeochem.2015.09.017				DEC 2015	2015	Nitrate contamination of shallow aquifers poses a major challenge in the development of sustainable agriculture, particularly in (semi-) arid regions, where groundwater is also used as potable water. In this study we estimate the relative contribution of the various nitrate sources contaminating the shallow aquifers underlying agricultural fields in the extremely arid region of the Central Arava Valley (CAV), southern Israel. The estimates are based on a chemical and isotopic mixing-reaction model describing the evolution of the delta(18)O(NO)3 and delta N-15(NO3) isotopic compositions from the sources to the aquifer. The model indicates that all fertilizers used in the agricultural fields: synthetic NO3-, synthetic NH4+ and manure, contaminate the CAV groundwater with nitrate. In most of CAV groundwaters, the contribution of each fertilizer to the groundwater contamination is relative to its proportion in the fertilization scheme of the cultivated fields. Two exceptions of this general observation were found: 1. One field showed a direct nitrate contamination from a "leaking" sewage reservoir, as indicated by its exceptionally high delta N-15(NO3) value that reached 9.2%; and 2. A very shallow alluvial aquifer, recharged by winter floods and not by the irrigation water, showed no nitrate isotopic "fingerprint" of manure, which is applied to the cultivated fields only during summer. Groundwater nitrate contamination is actuated by infiltration of irrigation water, which in addition underwent salinization as a result of evapotranspiration in the cultivated fields. Based on the relatively uniform and depleted groundwater delta O-18(H2O) compositions and the depleted delta O-18(NO3) values, within the possible range of fertilizers-derived nitrate as deduced by the model, the water-loss in the cultivated fields is transpiration-controlled. The isotope mixing-reaction model used here to identify the major nitrate contamination sources maybe used to help design a sustainable cultivation management strategy in similar arid regions. It can also be used to assess the fertilization efficiency and the relative impact of each fertilizer type. Such models may be particularly useful in evaluating highly heterogeneous and complicated aquifer systems, for which the formulation of absolute water and nitrate mass balances are impossible.

PCC 6803 that carry deletions of conserved residues in the plastoquinone-binding niche of the D1 protein were used to select for spontaneous mutations that restore photoautotrophic growth. Spontaneous pseudorevertants emerged from two deletion mutants, Delta YNIV246-9 and Delta NN266-7, when the cultures were maintained long after the carbon source (glucose) had been depleted from the medium and cells had reached stationary phase. Most pseudorevertants were found to contain tandem duplications of 6-45-base pair DNA sequences located close to the domain carrying the deletion; none of them restored the wild-type sequence. Three pseudorevertants isolated from the Delta YNIV246-9 mutant contained a duplication (7-15 codons) of the DNA sequence immediately downstream of the deletion; the protein region encoded by this DNA may include part of the putative de helix, an important constituent of the plastoquinone-binding niche. Three pseudorevertants isolated from the Delta NN266-7 mutant contained duplications corresponding to 2-8 amino acid residues adjacent to the site of the deletion, In all six pseudorevertants carrying duplications, the length of the D1 protein in the modified regions was restored to at least the length present in wild type, suggesting that a minimal length of these protein domains may be required for functional integrity, In another photoautotrophic strain isolated from Delta NN266-7, no secondary mutations could be identified in the gene coding for the D1 protein; such mutations apparently reside on another protein subunit of the photosystem II complex, Photosystem II function in the pseudorevertants was altered as compared with wild type in terms of growth and oxygen evolution rates, photosystem II concentration, the semiquinone equilibrium at the acceptor side, and thermostability. A mechanism leading to tandem sequence duplication may involve DNA damage followed by DNA synthesis, strand displacement, and ligation.									15	0	0	0	12	0	15			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:A1995RJ34700014	7622458

Established profiles reflect the high similarity between the courses of these processes. Basing on the scrupulous analysis of the profiles of their geometric and electron-topological parameters, it was established that the dipole-active WC <-> w tautomerizations of the Watson-Crick-like 2AP.T(WC)/2AP.C*(WC) mispairs, stabilized by the two classical N3H center dot center dot center dot N1, N2H center dot center dot O2 and one weak C6H center dot center dot center dot O4/N4 H-bonds, into the wobble 2AP.T*(w)/2AP.C(w) base pairs, respectively, joined by the two classical N2H center dot center dot center dot N3 and O4/N4H center dot center dot center dot N1 H-bonds, proceed via the concerted stepwise mechanism through the sequential intrapair proton transfer and subsequent large-scale shifting of the bases relative each other, through the planar, highly stable, zwitterionic transition states stabilized by the participation of the four H-bonds - N1(+)H center dot center dot center dot O4(-)/N4(-), N1(+)H center dot center dot center dot N3(-), N2(+)H center dot center dot center dot N3(-), and N2(+)H center dot center dot center dot O2(-). Moreover, it was found out that the 2AP.T(WC)<-> 2AP.T*(w)/2AP.C*(WC)<-> 2AP.C(w) tautomerization reactions occur non-dissociatively and are accompanied by the consequent replacement of the 10 unique patterns of the specific intermolecular interactions along the IRC. Obtained data are of paramount importance in view of their possible application for the control and management of the proton transfer, e.g. by external electric or laser fields.									13	0	0	0	5	0	13			0739-1102	1538-0254		WOS:000430514400001	28514900

Up to 14 800 turnovers (TO) and rates of 800 TO/min were obtained for the hydroxylation of adamantane. The hydroxylation of cis-decalin afforded cis-9-decalol and cis-decalin-9,10-diol, exclusively, thus, excluding a long-lived radicals mechanism. The kinetics of product evolution in a typical catalytic oxygenation showed an initial induction period followed by a fast, apparently zero-order phase with maximum rates and high efficiencies. Deuterium isotope effects (k(H)/k(D)) in the range of 4.2 - 6.4 were found for the hydroxylation of alkanes. A Hammett treatment of the data for the oxidation of para-substituted toluene derivatives showed a linear correlation with a highly negative rho(+) value of - 2.0. On the basis of kinetic and spectroscopic evidence, Ru-VI(TPFPP)(O)(2), Ru-II(TPFPP)(CO), and Ru-IV(TPFPP) Cl-2 observed during catalysis were ruled out as candidates for the active catalyst responsible for the high efficiencies and turnover rates in the oxidation reactions. The fastest rates of adamantane hydroxylation with 2,6-dichloropyridine N-oxide were achieved by the reductive activation of RuIV( TPFPP) Cl-2 with a zinc amalgam. This redox activation is consistent with the formation of an active Ru(III) intermediate in situ by a one-electron reduction of the Ru(IV) porphyrin. EPR spectra characteristic of Ru( III) have been observed upon the reduction of RuIV( TPFPP) Cl-2 with a zinc amalgam. In the adamantane oxidation mediated with Ru-III(TPFPP)(OEt), it was found that, during this process, the Ru( III) porphyrin was gradually converted to a dioxoRu(VI) porphyrin. Concomitant with this conversion, the reaction rates decreased. Catalyst activation was also stimulated by autoxidation of the solvent CH2Cl2. On the basis of these data, a mechanism is proposed that incorporates a "fast" cycle involving metastable Ru( III) and oxoRu(V) intermediates and a "slow" oxidation cycle, mediated by oxoRu( IV) and trans-dioxoRu(VI) porphyrin complexes.									72	4	0	0	15	0	76			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000238029400027	16749842

Although Venus should have had a large amount of surface water (like the Earth) during its formation, the current water content on the Venusian surface is only 1 part in 100 000 of that of the mass of Earth's oceans. Here a new concept is proposed to explain water removal on a steam-covered proto Venus, referred to as "impact-driven planetary desiccation". Since a steam atmosphere is photochemically unstable, water vapor dissociates into hydrogen and oxygen. Then, hydrogen escapes easily into space through hydrodynamic escape driven by strong extreme ultraviolet radiation from the young Sun. The focus is on the intense impact bombardment during the terminal stage of planetary accretion as generators of a significant amount of reducing agent. The fine-grained ejecta remove the residual oxygen, the counter part of escaped hydrogen, via the oxidation of iron-bearing rocks in a hot atmosphere. Thus, hypervelocity impacts cause net desiccation of the planetary surface. I constructed a stochastic cratering model using a Monte Carlo approach to investigate the cumulative mass of nonoxidized, ejected rocks due to the intense impact bombardment. The ejecta mass after each impact was calculated using the pi-group scaling laws and a modified Maxwell's Z model. The effect of projectile penetration into the ground on the ejecta mass was also included. Next, an upper limit on the total amount of removed water was calculated using the stoichiometric limit of the oxidation of basaltic rocks, taking into account the effect of fast H-2 escape. It is shown that a thick steam atmosphere with a mass equivalent to that of the terrestrial oceans would be removed. The cumulative mass of rocky ejecta released into the atmosphere reaches 1 wt% of the host planet, which is 10 000 times of the current mass of the Earth's atmosphere. These results strongly suggest that chemical reactions between such large amounts of ejecta and planetary atmospheres are among the key factors required to understand atmospheric mass and its composition, not only in the Solar System but also in extrasolar systems.

However, sustainable synthesis of CQD from green carbon sources and its application in water splitting has not been well explored. Herein, we synthesized CQD from orange peels and embedded them onto one-dimensional (1-D) cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanowires (average diameter 30 nm and length 2-4 mu m) via a facile chemical adsorption method. The synthesized photocatalysts were thoroughly characterized using various spectroscopic, microscopic, diffraction, and photoelectrochemical techniques. The photocatalysts were tested for water-splitting reaction under visible light. The effect of mass fraction of CQD in CdS on water splitting performance has been investigated both in the presence and absence of sacrificial reagents. The reusability of the photocatalyst has also been tested. The optimal catalyst, 0.4CQD/CdS, exhibited the highest H-2 production rate of 309 mmol g(-1)h(-1) (apparent quantum yield of 32.6%) which is 1.5 times higher than that with bare CdS. The excellent photocatalytic performance of CQD/CdS was due to the existence of sulfur vacancies and the formation of cadmium oxide with effective charge transfer and separation. The higher photostability of CQD/CdS compared to that of CdS in three consecutive cycles can be attributed to suppression of photocorrosion of CdS in the presence of CQD.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			0038-092X			WOS:000572920000006
