However, the control of the OER pathway by taking advantage of the intrinsic properties of catalysts remains a challenging task. Herein, we adopt perovskite nickelate (i.e., NdNiO3 (NNO)) and establish the link between structural anisotropy and the OER catalytic mechanism. The results elucidate that NNO with (100), (110), and (111) orientations display similar oxidative states and metal-oxygen covalency characteristics but distinct OER activities following the order of (100) > (110) > (111). Density function theory (DFT) results confirm that film orientation is a critical determinant of the reaction mechanism. The OER on (100)-NNO favors proceeding via a lattice-oxygen-mediated mechanism (LOM). In contrast, the reaction on (110)-NNO and (111)-NNO follows the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). The anisotropic oxygen vacancy formation energy and stability are strongly correlated to the reaction mechanism and performance, which can be described in brief by the metal-oxygen bond valence. Our results are a step toward achieving the long-sought convenient approach to tune the OER mechanism, which is applicable for a wide range of sustainable energy-related devices.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2168-0485			WOS:000636758600032

The interface chemistry of electrocatalysts plays an important role in the optimization of their catalytic activity and stability. However, these gas-involved reactions exhibit sluggish kinetics and complex reactions at triple-phase interfaces. Thus, interface engineering at multiscale levels plays a decisive role. Binder-free electrocatalysts have gained increasing popularity, owing to their enhanced electron transfer and improved mass diffusion. This Review summarizes the influence of binder-free electrocatalysts with optimized interfaces and emphasizes three key interfaces, including the electrocatalyst/substrate interface, the inner interface of the electrocatalyst, and the electrocatalyst/electrolyte/gas interface, which are integral to determining the properties of gas-involved electrocatalysts, including the electrical conductivity, intrinsic catalytic activity, and mass transfer behavior. Finally, prospects and future challenges for the further development of binder-free electrocatalysts are discussed.									19	2	0	0	0	0	20			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000554713800001	32696601

However, the water oxidation mechanism and selectivity on the different surfaces of BiVO4 are still not well understood, partly because of the structural complexity introduced by the presence of oxygen vacancies in the material. Using density functional theory, we show that the (001) surface of BiVO4 with subsurface vacancies is the most suitable for the oxygen evolution reaction, whereas the pristine (011) surface favors the hydrogen peroxide evolution reaction. A mechanism by which the vacancies can be removed from the surface, thereby influencing the water oxidation selectivity, is also described. Our results thus emphasize the crucial impact of the local structure on the catalytic selectivity in ternary oxides.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000716773800055

Upon the application of a positive bias potential H2Oads and OHads adsorbates are found to arrange in a hexagonal lattice with an irregular alternation. Increasing further the electrode potential then induces the oxygen evolution reaction, which is found to proceed through a hydrogen peroxide intermediate.

ADVANTAGE - The catalyst for HERS is economical and shows excellent HER performance, based on an inexpensive metal source, by substituting only some metal ions with noble metals having oxygen adsorbed to it through a cation exchange strategy using a transition metal that is inexpensive and has the most abundant electrical conductivity, thus functionalizing the metal ions substituted with the oxygen-absorbed noble metals. Oxygen is adsorbed to noble metal atoms so that an electronic configuration may be modulated, and a scaling relationship of the noble metal atoms may be removed. The catalyst has a high hydrogen evolution rate since hydrogen spillover occurs on the hetero-interface of the noble metal atoms. It can be rapidly moved to the transition metal matrix lattice in which active hydrogens provide abundant active sites of hydrogen bonding due to the presence of the hetero-interface of the atoms. Since the method for preparing the catalyst enables the catalyst to be prepared in a simple process using a cation exchange strategy, the production process can be simplified, the catalyst can be prepared even at low cost, the mass production is easy, and economic feasibility can be excellent.

However, the sluggish kinetics of the HER/OER/ORR and their dependency on expensive noble metal catalysts (e.g., Pt) obstruct their large-scale application. Hence, the development of efficient and robust bifunctional or trifunctional electrocatalysts in nanodimension for both oxygen reduction/evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions is highly desired and challenging for their commercialization in renewable energy technologies.

To understand the microscopic surface reaction mechanism, operando soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of an LCF film surface was conducted during the evolution and incorporation of oxygen. LCF film was prepared on yttria-stabilized zirconia and a current was applied throughout the film at similar to 600 degrees C. From operando X-ray photoelectron spectra, surface oxide species involved in the surface exchange reaction obviously appeared on the film during the evolution of oxygen from the surface. The number of surface oxide species abruptly decreased during incorporation of oxygen. By applying the current from a negative to positive value, the numbers of surface oxide species and ligand holes near Fe3+ ions on the surface both significantly increased. The results infer that ligand holes in the Fe 3d-O 2p hybrid orbitals correspond to active reaction sites at which surface oxide species change to oxygen molecules. Increasing the number of active reaction sites is key to improving oxygen evolution of mixed conductive oxides.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000870180700001	36221309

The use of chemical probes is proposed, which, owing to their specific affinities towards different oxygen species, unravel the role played by these species on the OER mechanism. For that, tetraalkylammonium (TAA) cations, previously known for their surfactant properties, are introduced, which interact with the active oxygen sites and modify the hydrogen bond network on the surface of OER catalysts. Combining chemical probes with isotopic and pH-dependent measurements, it is further demonstrated that the introduction of iron into amorphous Ni oxyhydroxide films used as model catalysts deeply modifies the proton exchange properties, and therefore the OER mechanism and activity.									70	2	0	0	11	0	70			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000405308500005	28561531

Here we present a universal design principle to evaluate the activity of graphene-based single-atom catalysts towards the oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions. Our results indicate that the catalytic activity of single-atom catalysts is highly correlated with the local environment of the metal centre, namely its coordination number and electronegativity and the electronegativity of the nearest neighbour atoms, validated by available experimental data. More importantly, we reveal that this design principle can be extended to metal-macrocycle complexes. The principle not only offers a strategy to design highly active nonprecious metal single-atom catalysts with specific active centres, for example, Fe-pyridine/pyrrole-N-4 for the oxygen reduction reaction; Co-pyrrole-N-4 for the oxygen evolution reaction; and Mn-pyrrole-N-4 for the hydrogen evolution reaction to replace precious Pt/Ir/Ru-based catalysts, but also suggests that macrocyclic metal complexes could be used as an alternative to graphene-based single-atom catalysts.									797	51	0	0	49	0	799			2520-1158			WOS:000446614600011

Mixing of multiple transition-metal elements is a promising way to enhance electrochemical catalysis. In the present study, we investigated the OER and HER catalytic activities of tetravalent Fe-Co mixed perovskite oxide CaFe0.5Co0.5O3. CaFe0.5Co0.5O3 demonstrated a higher OER activity than those of the parent compounds CaFeO3 and CaCoO3. In contrast, the HER activity of CaFe0.5Co0.5O3 was not significantly enhanced. These observations suggest that the mixing of Fe4+ and Co4+ ions is an efficient way to activate OER.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1345-9678	1347-5320		WOS:000575859300020

Bifunctional oxygen electrodes should be able to perform both reactions with good chemical stability over a wide range of potentials. Perovskites are recognized for their good activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction. In this work, a La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3 perovskite (LSFCO) is proposed and investigated for operation as both oxygen reduction and evolution catalyst in an aqueous alkaline solution. In order to improve the conductivity of the electrode, LSFCO is mixed with a high surface area conductive carbon black. The so obtained catalyst is investigated in a half-cell by using a three-electrode configuration, in a KOH solution at ambient temperature, and compared to a Pd/C catalyst. Thinking of a possible use in a rechargeable metal-air battery operating in aqueous media (such as Fe-air,Zn-air, etc.), LSFCO has been subjected to charge-discharge cycles at high current density. Results have proved that although LSFCO is less active than Pd/C for the oxygen reduction reaction, it is significantly more active for the oxygen evolution reaction. Besides, the LSFCO-based catalyst shows enhanced stability when subjected to charge-discharge cycles. The low cost of the perovskite and a good compromise between activity and stability, makes it a promising catalyst for electrochemical devices requiring bifunctionality.					2nd E3 Mediterranean Symposium - Electrochemistry for Environment and Energy2nd E3 Mediterranean Symposium - Electrochemistry for Environment and Energy	SEP 14-16, 2016SEP 14-16, 2016	Univ Studi Milano; Univ Milano Bicocca; Politecnico Milano; Royal Spanish Soc Chem, Grp Electrochemistry; Spanish Network Excellence Environm & Energy Applicat Electrochem Technol; Italian Chem Soc, Board Electrochemistry DivUniv Studi Milano; Univ Milano Bicocca; Politecnico Milano; Royal Spanish Soc Chem, Grp Electrochemistry; Spanish Network Excellence Environm & Energy Applicat Electrochem Technol; Italian Chem Soc, Board Electrochemistry Div	Gargnano, ITALYGargnano, ITALY	29	0	0	0	1	0	29			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000423650000053

The calculated free energy changes for different possible intermediate reactions show that at the equilibrium potential of 1.23 V (against the NHE), the oxygen evolution reaction is not completely downhill indicating that the photo-generated holes at 1.23 V cannot oxidize water to oxygen. The oxygen evolution reaction on the g-CN surface is however found to be completely downhill at and above the potential of 2.16 V. As the valence band of g-CN is shown to be located at a potential of 2.64 V, the photo-generated holes in the valence band can oxidise water to oxygen without the aid of any co-catalyst. However, the hydrogen evolution reaction is found to have an overpotential of around 1.1 V and the photo-generated electrons in the conduction band of g-CN are placed at around 0.26 V above the hydrogen reduction potential indicating that the hydrogen evolution is possible only in the presence of a co-catalyst.									44	2	0	0	1	0	44			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000365011400058

The challenging sluggish reaction kinetics of the OER can be overcome via developing highly efficient electrocatalysts, which experience a dynamic structural evolution process during the reaction. However, the reaction mechanism of the structural transformation of electrocatalysts during the OER and the structure-activity correlation in understanding the real active sites remain elusive. Fortunately, operando characterizations offer a platform to study the structural evolution processes and the reaction mechanisms of OER electrocatalysts. In this review, using several in situ/operando techniques some recent advances are elaborated with emphases on tracking the structural evolution processes of electrocatalysts, recording the reaction intermediates during electrocatalysis, and building a link between the structure and activity/stability of electrocatalysts. Moreover, theoretical considerations are also discussed to assist operando characterization understanding. Finally, some perspectives are provided which are expected to be helpful to tackle the current challenges in operando monitoring and unraveling the reaction mechanisms of OER electrocatalysts.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000739205200001

In contrast to previous studies, we studied these two reactions simultaneously under various pH and methanol concentrations with electrodes containing a series of NiOOH surface concentrations. We found that nickel based catalysts are more suitable to be used as oxygen evolution catalysts than methanol oxidation catalysts based on the observation that: The rate-determining step of methanol oxidation involves NiOOH, OH- and methanol while high methanol to OH- ratio could poison the NiOOH sites. Since NiOOH is involved in the rate-determining step, methanol oxidation suffers from high over-potential and oxygen evolution is favored over methanol oxidation in the presence of an equivalent amount (0.1 M) of alkali and methanol.

They facilitate charge transfer reactions whilst showing a good stability. These materials, fabricated as freestanding electrodes pose the potential of simplified electrode manufacturing procedures whilst demonstrating excellent electrocatalytic, mechanical, and structural properties, resulting from interconnected (via chemical or van der Waals force bonded) network structures. In such freestanding configuration, the lack of a binder leads to a better conductivity, ease in the manufacturing processing, and allows a lower catalyst mass loading, all of which lead to obvious benefits. This Minireview summarizes different fabrication techniques of freestanding non-precious-metal oxygen electrocatalysts along with their performance towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and/or oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we discuss electrocatalysts produced by using freestanding substrates and those obtained through the self-assembly of different precursors. The advantages of using freestanding versus non-freestanding configurations are also pondered. Challenges and perspectives for freestanding electrocatalysts are presented at the end of the Minireview as a guideline for future studies in the field. This work is expected to serve as inspiration for science colleagues to develop further studies into design, processing and testing strategies of freestanding low-cost oxygen electrocatalysts.									29	7	0	0	0	0	30			2196-0216			WOS:000438339200005

Low cost, transition metals such as nickel and iron-based oxides/ hydroxides have been regarded as promising catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media with overpotentials as low as similar to 200 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), however, they are generally unsuitable for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, we show a Janus nanoparticle catalyst with a nickel-iron oxide interface and multi-site functionality for a highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction with a comparable performance to the benchmark platinum on carbon catalyst. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the hydrogen evolution reaction catalytic activity of the nanoparticle is induced by the strong electronic coupling effect between the iron oxide and the nickel at the interface. Remarkably, the catalyst also exhibits extraordinary oxygen evolution reaction activity, enabling an active and stable bi-functional catalyst for whole cell water-splitting with, to the best of our knowledge, the highest energy efficiency (83.7%) reported to date.									276	7	0	0	14	0	276			2041-1723			WOS:000502074000001	31811129

As such, in this study, a catalyst material with a ginger-like morphology consisting of Co6W6C is synthesized via a hydrothermal reaction and pyrolysis treatment. The Co6W6C catalyst exhibits satisfactory electrochemical properties towards both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions in an alkaline electrolyte, with a low overpotential, low Tafel slope, and durable stability. Co6W6C possesses a high activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline conditions, with an onset potential and overpotential of -0.024 V and 101 mV, respectively, and low Tafel slope of 80.5 mV dec(-1) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, Co6W6C achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction at an overpotential of only 343 mV. Furthermore, electrochemical stability tests indicate that the Co6W6C catalyst maintains 91% of the original current after 60,000 s for the hydrogen evolution reaction and 95% of the original current after 45,000 s for the oxygen evolution reaction. Moreover, electrochemical splitting of water via a two-electrode system employing this catalyst can hold 89% of the initial current after 40,000 sin 1 M KOH.

A reaction model of anodic processes is presented, which quantitatively fits the experimental data. It is concluded that the presence of silver in lead modifies both the kinetic parameters of the main reaction of oxygen evolution, and the potential dependence of the oxide layer conductivity. It is also shown that the reaction of oxygen evolution is inhibited by a silver salt adsorbate. The electrode coverage by this adsorbate appears to be increased in the Mn2+-containing electrolyte, thus changing the inhibition into a passivation process.					3rd International Symposium on Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy3rd International Symposium on Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy	MAY 07-12, 1995MAY 07-12, 1995		YSERMONDE, BELGIUMYSERMONDE, BELGIUM	43	4	0	0	1	0	45			0013-4686			WOS:A1996UK66700015

For the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction catalytic performance, Co0.5Ni0.5P nanoparticles embedded in carbon layers on nickel foam (NF) (Co0.5Ni0.5P/NC/NF) requires an overpotential of 90.0 mV to deliver current density of 10 mA cm(-2), approaching that of commercial Pt/C which was fabricated on NF (Pt/C/NF) catalyst. As an anodic oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst, with a potential as low as 1.56V, the current density response is 50 mA cm(-2), showing superior performance close to RuO2/NF. Moreover, in the alkaline electrolyzer, CoxNi1-xP nanoparticles require a low potential of 1.49 V to achieve a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) for full water splitting. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This method enables large-scale synthesis that offers superior uniformity, solution dispersity and controllable concentration of oxygen vacancies on surface. The large surface area of porous cobalt oxide nanoplates together with enriched oxygen vacancies provide more active sites, which promote faster exchange of intermediates and more efficient electron transfer. The as prepared cobalt oxide nanoplates manifest oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential as low as 306 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) in 1 M KOH, which is superior to the values of most reported Co-based electrocatalysts.									330	13	0	0	19	0	332			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000419832100013		
J	Bouzid, A.; Gono, P.; Pasquarello, A.								Reaction pathway of oxygen evolution on Pt(111) revealed through constant Fermi level molecular dynamics [arXiv]								arXiv								12 pp.	12 pp.						16 Dec. 2019	2019	The pathway of the oxygen evolution reaction at the Pt(111)/water interface is disclosed through constant Fermi level molecular dynamics. Upon the application of a positive bias potential H2Oads and OHads adsorbates are found to arrange in a hexagonal lattice with an irregular alternation. Increasing further the electrode potential then induces the oxygen evolution reaction, which is found to proceed through a hydrogen peroxide intermediate. Calculation of the associated overpotential shows a reduction of 0.2 eV compared to the associative mechanism. This result highlights the forcefullness of the applied scheme in exploring catalytic reactions in an unbiased way. [doi:10.1016/j.jcat.2019.05.025].									0	0	0	0	0	0	0						INSPEC:19628689

Chemical and electrochemical reactions that occur after passivation have received little attention. Chronopotentiometry, linear sweep voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry, and impedance spectroscopy have been used to elucidate three reactions that occur after passivation of commercial copper anodes. These involve the dissolution of silver and subsequent cementation and transformation of selenides, the oxidation of lead sulfate to lead oxide, and oxygen evolution. The amount of silver dissolution depends on the silver content of the anode, the time to passivation, and the molar ratio of Ag/(Se+Te). The oxidation of lead from PbSO4 to PbOx explains a potential plateau of oxygen evolution. Silver affects the duration of oxygen evolution on the PbOx. Anodes containing kupferglimmer display a characteristic oxygen evolution potential. It is believed that kupferglimmer provides a lower overpotential for oxygen evolution than the other slime phases or passivated surface.					4th International Conference of the COPPER 99/COBRE 994th International Conference of the COPPER 99/COBRE 99	OCT 10-13, 1999OCT 10-13, 1999	Chilean Inst Min Engineers; Met Soc Canadian Inst Min, Met & Petr; Minerals Met & Mat Soc; Soc Min, Met & ExploratChilean Inst Min Engineers; Met Soc Canadian Inst Min, Met & Petr; Minerals Met & Mat Soc; Soc Min, Met & Explorat	PHOENIX, AZPHOENIX, AZ	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					0-87339-437-2	WOS:000085714700026

However, the inclusion of an optimum amount of oxygen-ion vacancies at the surface and in the bulk of Co3O4 remains a synthetic challenge in order to enhance the efficacy of the oxygen evolution reaction. Here, we have attempted a single-step scalable approach of solution combustion synthesis to incorporate the oxide ion vacancies in high-surface-area Co3O4. To benchmark the catalyst, we also synthesized Co3O4 using elevated-temperature calcination routes. Detailed structural and surface analyses revealed the significant presence of oxide ion vacancies in the combustion-synthesized material. The solution combustion synthesized Co3O4 due to the presence of oxygen-ion vacancies exhibited an excellent oxygen evolution reactivity with a lower overpotential and higher current density compared with the other Co3O4 materials synthesized using calcination routes. Tafel slope calculations indicated that the formation of surface hydroxyl species through water dissociation over the oxide ion vacancies is the rate-determining step of the overall reaction. The mechanistic role of the oxygen-ion vacancies in the oxygen evolution reaction was further explored via DFT studies.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000769622700001

In this work, a series of magnetic electrocatalysts, CoNigC, was successfully prepared. The catalysts exhibited roomtemperature ferromagnetism with a high saturation magnetization (over 50 emu/g). An external magnetic field significantly improved the catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution of the catalysts under alkaline conditions. The oxygen evolution reaction overpotential of the catalysts decreased by 14 mV, and the Tafel slope decreased by 22.41 mV.dec(-1) when a permanent magnetic field (similar to 360 mT) was applied. This magnetic enhancement effect arises from the promotion of electron transfer and oxygen adsorption due to spin polarization and alignment. This study demonstrates a promising strategy of using magnetic induction to boost oxygen evolution activity of magnetic electrocatalysts.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2168-0485			WOS:000696378200033

This is due to their exceptional compositions, diverse structures, tunability, larger surface areas, higher porosities, homometallic/heterometallic cluster as a secondary building unit, numerous empty space regions for adsorbing guest molecules and, at the same time, chemically transform. In this review, we discuss various electrocatalytic performances of porous MOF-based and MOF-derived electrocatalysts for carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and overall water splitting. The study firstly discusses the evolution of porous MOF-based and MOF-derived materials and the four generations of MOFs. We thereby discuss the synthetic methods of various porous MOFs and MOF-derived electrocatalysts. The study further highlights comprehensive advancements in the fast-growing literature in the field and the corresponding correlation between porous MOFs and MOF-derived structural parameters and electrocatalytic performance for each energy conversion device. Conclusively, this study highlighted some associated challenges, various strategies, and prospects to foster advancement in the field. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Using first-principles density functional on theory calculations, we screen 48 combinations of single atom catalysts anchored at defective monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (A(1)/TMD; A = Ni, Cu, Pd, Ag, Pt and Au; TM = Mo, W, Nb and Ta; D = S and Se). With established methodologies, we identify five best catalysts for each of oxygen reduction/evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions among the stable candidates. A scaling relation between the Gibb's free energy for intermediates is figured out to understand the governing mechanism of single atom catalysts with varying transition metal dichalcogenides supports and to introduce key descriptor. Pt-1/MoS2 is proposed as the best bifunctional catalyst for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction. In addition, Pt-1/NbSe2 and Pt-1/TaS2 are promising candidates for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. Treating the support itself as an active site for hydrogen evolution reaction, Pd-1/NbS2 and Pt-1/NbS2 are proposed as potential bifunctional catalysts toward oxygen reduction and evolution reaction, respectively. Conceptual design principle via high-throughput screening of single atom catalyst is demonstrated as a great approach to determine active and durable bifunctional single atom catalysts.									47	4	0	0	1	0	47			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000455471100062

Herein, a series of Co nanoparticles and highly dispersed Fe loaded on N-doped porous carbon substrates are prepared through a "double-solvent" method with in situ doped metal-organic frameworks as precursors. The optimized catalysts exhibit excellent performance for oxygen reduction and evolution reaction. Furthermore, rechargeable Zn-air batteries with designed catalysts demonstrate higher peak power density and better cycling stability than those with commercial Pt/C+RuO2. According to structure characterizations and electrochemical tests, the interaction of Co nanoparticles and highly dispersed Fe contributes to the superior performance for oxygen electrocatalysis. In addition, large specific surface areas, porous structures and interconnected three-dimensional carbon networks also play important roles in improving oxygen electrocatalysis. This work provides inspiration for rational design of advanced oxygen electrocatalysts and paves a way for the practical application of rechargeable Zn-air batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000839646500001	35951169

The rotating disk electrode (RDE) configuration in combination with common electrochemical techniques such as linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were applied to characterize the behavior of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) taking place on LSCO in 0.1 M KOH solution. The results show that the oxygen electrocatalysis process in LSCO follows a multistep charge-transfer pathway. A physics based, generalized electrochemical model, encompassing two sequential 2e(-) steps with HO2- as an intermediate species and one parallel 4e(-) step, has been established to account for the multistep charge-transfer behavior with very satisfactory results, yielding a series of important electrode kinetic transfer coefficients and exchange current densities for the elementary electrochemical reactions considered. Finally, LSCO is found to be a better oxygen electrode for OER than ORR.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			2574-0962			WOS:000458706400049

Herein, two highly efficient electrocatalysts are synthesized, composed of N, P codoped carbon (NPC) modified with noble metals phosphides (RhxP/NPC and RuP/NPC) through pyrolysis of a mixture of RhCl(3)xH(2)O or RuCl3 xH(2)O, respectively, with phytic acid. Unlike the reported rhodium and ruthenium phosphides, RhxP/NPC and RuP/NPC have a low loading of Rh (approximate to 0.4 wt%) and Ru (approximate to 0.5 wt%) and yet still exhibit excellent trifunctional activities for oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, and hydrogen evolution reactions. For hydrogen evolution, RhxP/NPC shows a Pt-like activity and excellent durability in acidic medium. Notably, RuP/NPC becomes more active after 2000 cycles in the durability test. For oxygen reduction, both of the catalysts show a half-wave potential of 0.89 V, which is positively shifted 40 mV relative to that of Pt/C (0.85 V) in 0.1 m KOH. In addition, RhxP/NPC and RuP/NPC also exhibit activities superior to that of IrO2 in oxygen evolution. Finally, zinc-air batteries and water splitting cells assembled with RhxP/NPC and RuP/NPC catalysts display good performance.									169	9	0	0	5	0	170			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000447257000005

BiOI in-situ grew on the surface of g-C3N4 nanotubes derived from melamine. The rapid recombination between photoexcited electrons and holes of pristine semiconductors was prevented via building the stable heterojunction. The SEM results indicated that the BiOI was wrapped around the surface of g-C3N4 nanotubes, resulting in an optimized electronic transmission pathway. Much lower charge transfer resistance at the p-n heterojunction was demonstrated compared with pristine BiOI according to the EIS results, thus leading to the faster surface reaction rates. Moreover, the composite exhibited both outstanding OER and HER activities under illuminated conditions. This study may shed light upon establishing a bifunctional photoelectrocatalysis for photoelectrochemical water splitting based on stable 2D metal and 1D metal-free nanocomposite.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0048-9697	1879-1026		WOS:000809654900014	35618118

Biomass longan aril serves not only as carbon source for catalyst supporting, but also a shell forming material and nitrogen doping receptor. When serving as electrocatalysts for oxygen electrode reaction, such bimetallic composite exhibits superior bi-functional electrocatalytic activities towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Benefiting from the high-conductive carbon shell and the coordination effect between NiFe alloy and nitrogen doped porous carbon support, the resultant FeNi@NC/NC achieved high durability over ORR and OER.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7				2352-4928		WOS:000571067600005

In this work, we report the crystal phase dependent photo- and electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of CoSe2. In electrocatalytic reaction, we firstly found that CoSe2 with orthorhombic phase (o-CoSe2) showed a higher OER performance than that of CoSe2 with cubic phase (c-CoSe2). In the further exploration of photocatalytic application using Fe2O3 as light harvester and CoSe2 as cocatalysts, o-CoSe2/Fe2O3 can realize the qualitative changes of photocatalytic oxygen evolution performance from "0" to "1". As contrast, c-CoSe2/Fe2O3 cannot work in photocatalytic oxygen evolution process under the same condition. Experimental and theoretical analysis uncover that, the key factor leading to the crystal phase-dependent performance is the decreased activation barrier of H2O on o-CoSe2 surface. This work opens up an opportunity of correlating the CoSe2 crystal phase with performance in OER.

However, the high costs, complex instruments and pollution risks in the synthesis process make oxygen-functionalized graphene difficult to be industrialized. The microwave reaction has originally been used to remove the oxygen groups on graphene structures. In this work, the microwave reaction is reversed to decorate oxygen groups on graphene from carbon cloth, by solely using a household microwave oven. After microwave treatment, the carbon cloth shows greatly improved OER performance with a much lower overpotential of 417 mV, in comparison with the pristine carbon cloth (627 mV), due to the decoration of oxygen groups on graphene, a higher electron conductivity and a higher specific surface area. Meanwhile, an overpotential of 542 mV at 10 mAcm(-2) is obtained in an acidic electrolyte, which is one of the best values for non-precious OER catalysts in acidic media. This work provides a facile, green and economic method for producing functionalized carbon catalysts for OER.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000434071100022

Herein, a novel Cu-based electrocatalyst composed of Cu97P3-x-yOxNy nanoparticles supported on N, P co-doped carbon is synthesized straightforward by the annealing of the Cu-phytic acid gel under an argon and ammonia gases atmosphere. The Cu97P3-x-yOxNy/N, P co-doped carbon catalyst displays the outstanding catalytic performance for both the oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline solution, which is ascribed to the synergistic effect of Cu97P3-x-yOxNy and N, P co-doped carbon. Meanwhile, the primary and rechargeable zinc-air batteries assembled by the Cu97P3-x-yOxNy/N, P co-doped carbon catalyst exhibit a high specific capacity and remarkable charge-discharge cycle stability, which are comparable to that of the benchmark Pt/C and IrO2.

In contrast to essentially monotonic activity trends (i.e. from Li+ to Cs+) reported in the literature for alkaline media, the nature of the cations influences the activity of the Pt electrodes largely non-monotonously in the presence of SO42- ions. This is in certain cases due to the specifically adsorbing (bi) sulfate anions which make interactions between electrolyte components and reaction intermediates very complex. Surprisingly, the activity of the Pt(1 1 1) electrodes towards all investigated electrocatalytic reactions was substantially higher in Rb+ ions containing electrolytes (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

An apparent scaling between oxygen vs. chlorine evolution has been established, making it challenging to carry the two reactions out individually with 100% faradaic efficiency. To aid selectivity determination, we developed a new method to quickly measure chlorine evolution rates using a conventional RRDE setup. We showed that a Pt ring fixed at 0.95 V vs. RHE in pH 0.88 can selectively reduce the Cl-2 formed on the disk and this allows precise and flexible data acquisition. Using this method, we demonstrate that oxygen evolution and chlorine evolution on a glassy carbon supported IrOx catalyst proceed independently, and that the selectivity towards chlorine evolution (epsilon(CER)) rapidly approaches 100% as [Cl-] increases from 0 to 100 mM. Our results suggest that on IrOx, oxygen evolution is not suppressed or influenced by the presence of Cl- or by the chlorine evolution reaction taking place simultaneously on the surface.									73	2	0	0	6	0	75			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000435619700035

However, the inherent linear scaling relation for most catalytic materials imposes a theoretical overpotential ceiling, limiting the development of efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, using modeled NaxMn3O7 materials, we report an effective strategy to construct better oxygen evolution electrocatalyst through tuning both lattice oxygen reactivity and scaling relation via alkali metal ion mediation. Specifically, the number of Na+ is linked with lattice oxygen reactivity, which is determined by the number of oxygen hole in oxygen lone-pair states formed by native Mn vacancies, governing the barrier symmetry between O-H bond cleavage and O-O bond formation. On the other hand, the presence of Na+ could have specific noncovalent interaction with pendant oxygen in *OOH to overcome the limitation from linear scaling relation, reducing the overpotential ceiling. Combining in situ spectroscopy-based characterization with first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that an intermediate level of Na+ mediation (NaMn3O7) exhibits the optimum oxygen evolution activity. This work provides a new rational recipe to develop highly efficient catalyst towards water oxidation or other oxidative reactions through tuning lattice oxygen reactivity and scaling relation. While water-splitting provides a renewable means to generate fuel, the water-oxidation half-reaction is considered a bottleneck process. Here, authors tune lattice oxygen reactivity and scaling relations via alkali metal ion mediation in NaMn3O7 for oxygen evolution electrocatalysis.									36	3	0	0	3	0	36			2041-1723			WOS:000669944900002	34183651

Unfortunately, it is also hindered by possible oxidation reactions of chloride and (to a lesser extent) bromide, which can occur in parallel to the evolution of oxygen and form harmful by-products at the anode. Although the respective oxidation reactions of Br- and Cl- have been researched quite well on Pt, not much is known concerning bromide oxidation and its effect on the evolution of chlorine and oxygen for metal oxides, which are the class of electrocatalysts overwhelmingly used in industry. Using glassy carbon-supported iridium oxide (IrOx) as a model system, we investigated the oxidation behaviour of this well-known oxygen evolution catalyst in an acidic Br-/Cl- electrolyte. We first briefly discuss the solution chemistry and oxidation products that may be expected. Model studies were performed of the parallel evolution of Br-2, Cl-2 and O-2 to increase the understanding of the anodic competition problem, with a special focus on the selectivity towards oxygen. Using rotating ring-disk voltammetry and UV-Vis spectroscopy, our results suggest that bromide and chloride competitively absorb on IrOx, but do not alter each other's oxidation reaction mechanisms, which both seem to adhere best to a Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. We also find that bromide and chloride adsorption significantly slow down the oxygen evolution reaction, in an additive way. Even a relatively small amount of bromide highly affected the oxygen evolution selectivity. Formation of the interhalogen compound BrCl, which is possible in a mixed Br-/Cl- electrolyte, does not seem to occur. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Therefore, the development of electrocatalysts for the OER and the ORR is of essential importance. Indeed, various advanced electrocatalysts have been designed for the ORR or the OER; however, the origin of the advanced activity of oxygen electrocatalysts is still somewhat controversial. The enhanced activity is usually attributed to the high surface areas, the unique facet structures, the enhanced conductivities, or even to unclear synergistic effects, but the importance of the defects, especially the intrinsic defects, is often neglected. More recently, the important role of defects in oxygen electrocatalysis has been demonstrated by several groups. To make the defect effect clearer, the recent development of this concept is reviewed here and a novel principle for the design of oxygen electrocatalysts is proposed. An overview of the defects in carbon-based, metal-free electrocatalysts for ORR and various defects in metal oxides/selenides for OER is also provided. The types of defects and controllable strategies to generate defects in electrocatalysts are presented, along with techniques to identify the defects. The defect-activity relationship is also explored by theoretical methods.									966	84	0	0	41	0	986			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000418272000002	28508469

Here, we prepared a series of hierarchical urchin-like bimetallic Ni/Zn metal-organic framework nanomaterials that served as high-performance electrocatalysts, by regulating the Ni2+/Zn2+ ratio and using a facile one-step hydrothermal method for the application of the oxygen evolution reaction. The structure of the hierarchical urchin-like microspheres could improve the utilization efficiency of the active species by facilitating the diffusion of gas and reducing the transport resistance of ions, due to its features of a large interfacial area and convenient diffusion channels. In addition, we found that the higher the Ni ratio was, the better the electrocatalytic performance of these bimetallic metal-organic framework nanomaterials.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			2296-2646			WOS:000470109100001	31231637

These materials' electrochemical activity towards both oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) was studied. The cobalt substitution level determines some physicochemical properties and, particularly, the surface concentration of Co and Mn's different oxidation states. As a result, the electroactivity of perovskite materials can be tuned using their composition. The presence of cobalt at low concentration influences the catalytic activity positively, and better bifunctionality is attained. As in other perovskites, their low electrical conductivity limits their applicability in electrochemical devices. It was found that the electrochemical performance improved significantly by physically mixing with a mortar the active materials with two different carbon black materials. The existence of a synergistic effect between the electroactive component and the carbon material was interpreted in light of the strong carbon-oxygen-metal interaction. Some mixed samples are promising electrocatalysts towards both ORR and OER.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8				2079-4991		WOS:000603084400001	33266063

Even though noble-metal oxides (PtO2 IrO2, RuO2, and RhO2) are the most active materials for the oxygen evolution reaction, low-cost transition metal oxides are typically used in alkaline electrolysis due to their abundance and relatively high activity and stability. Thus, nickel, cobalt, and manganese have been extensively explored as bifunctional catalysts, capable of catalyzing both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for the conversion and storage of energy. To improve their catalytic properties, different strategies are used; either by changing the method of preparation or the doping of metal ions. In this paper, we describe the preparation of Mn0.5Ni1.5CoO4oxide by sol-gel method, and we discuss a comparison of electrocatalytic properties between NiO, Mn0.5Ni1.5CoO4and Pt/C.					2018 Renewable Energies, Power Systems & Green Inclusive Economy (REPS-GIE)2018 Renewable Energies, Power Systems & Green Inclusive Economy (REPS-GIE)	23-24 April 201823-24 April 2018		Casablanca, MoroccoCasablanca, Morocco	0	0	0	0	0	0	0						INSPEC:18189090

A simple and cost-effective technique is utilized to prepare carbon iron phthalocyanine composites. Furthermore, to investigate ball milling effects, iron phthalocyanine is ball milled, which is used to prepare the carbon ball-milled iron phthalocyanine composites. All the prepared composites exhibit better catalytic activity in both oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions than Pt/C, indicating carbon support significantly improves the stability, conductivity, and surface properties of iron phthalocyanine. The ball-milling improves specific surface area, which in turn enhances the oxygen evolution reaction activity of the composites. When the carbon-iron phthalocyanine composites were applied to an air-cathode catalyst in a lithium-oxygen battery, high reversibility and low over-potential were attained. Among all the synthesized catalysts, the reduced graphene oxide_ball-milled iron phthalocyanine composite exhibits superior bifunctional electrocatalytic activity with high reversibility (92%) and low over-potential (0.7 V) due to enhanced surface properties.									37	0	0	0	2	0	37			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000412957200047

In this review, the configuration and fundamental oxygen electrochemical reactions on air cathodes are briefly introduced for Zn-air batteries first. Then, the latest bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts are summarized in detail. Finally, the perspectives are provided for the future investigations on bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts.

Previous studies have shown that grain boundary density is related to the catalytic activity of the carbon dioxide reduction reaction, but there is still no convincing evidence that the GBs provide surfaces with enhanced activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Combination of various electrochemical measurements and chemical analysis reveals the GB density at surface of NiFe electrocatalysts directly affects the overall OER. In situ electrochemical microscopy vividly shows that the OER occurs mainly at the GB during overall reaction. It is observed that the reaction determining steps are altered by grain boundary densities and the meaningful work function difference between the inside of grain and GBs exists. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy shows that extremely high index planes are exposed at the GBs, enhancing the oxygen evolution activity. The specific nature of GBs and its effects on the OER demonstrated in this study can be applied to the various polycrystalline electrocatalysts.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2366-9608			WOS:000584423800001	34927882

Their electronic structures can be easily tuned by neighboring support atoms or ligands to control their activities for different reactions. The high accessibility and therefore almost 100 % reactivity of the highly distributed active sites provide new opportunities for electrochemical applications that were previously only suitable for noble metals. Although a lot of work has been done in this area, the demand for large-scale applications and, therefore, also large-scale production is still far from sufficient. In this Review, we selected some recent publications to show the current state of applications of dispersed single-atom catalysts in the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, with a focus on their mechanisms in reactions, the underlying challenges, and synthesis methods. A further discussion on how the electrocatalytic performance of the supported single atom catalysts can be tailored to meet the requirements of large-scale applications is also proposed.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2196-0216			WOS:000481471800002

Lithium cobalt oxide is a promising nonprecious metal-based electrocatalyst for oxygen electrocatalysis; its activity, however, is still far from the requirements of practical applications. Here, a new LiCoO2-based electrocatalyst with nanosheet morphology is developed by a combination of Mg doping and shear force-assisted exfoliation strategies toward enhanced oxygen reduction and evolution reaction kinetics. It is demonstrated that the coupling effect of Mg doping and the exfoliation can effectively modulate the electronic structure of LiCoO2, in which Co3+ can be partially oxidized to Co4+ and the Co-O covalency can be enhanced, which is closely associated with the improvement of intrinsic activity. Meanwhile, the unique nanosheet morphology also helps to expose more active Co species. This work offers new insights into deploying the electronic structure engineering strategy for the development of efficient and durable catalysts for energy applications.									62	5	0	0	4	0	62			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000467988900005

Unfortunately, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) due to the interdependence multiple steps procedure require high overpotential to achieve appreciable catalytic current density, resulting in relatively low energy conversion efficiencies. Therefore, development of high-performance OER electrocatalysts is vital to drive the commercial application of water splitting. This review highlights current progress of representative catalyst electrocatalysts in the past decade. Active site regulation for excellent OER performance of precious metal single atoms catalyst, high-entropy alloy, transition metals oxides, transition metal chalcogenide are emphasized. And a more in-depth exploration of OER reaction mechanism by in situ technique and DFT results will be conducted. This review can provide the basis for the development and modification of OER electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2296-2646			WOS:000855749700001	35572100

Among the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, NiFe based oxyhydroxides show the highest catalytic activity. However, the details of their OER mechanism are still unclear, due to the elusive nature of the OER intermediates. Here, using a novel differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) cell interface, we performed isotope-labelling experiments in O-18-labelled aqueous alkaline electrolyte on Ni(OH)(2) and NiFe layered double hydroxide nanocatalysts. Our experiments confirm the occurrence of Mars-van-Krevelen lattice oxygen evolution reaction mechanism in both catalysts to various degrees, which involves the coupling of oxygen atoms from the catalyst and the electrolyte. The quantitative charge analysis suggests that the participating lattice oxygen atoms belong exclusively to the catalyst surface, confirming DFT computational hypotheses. Also, DEMS data suggest a fundamental correlation between the magnitude of the lattice oxygen mechanism and the faradaic efficiency of oxygen controlled by pseudocapacitive oxidative metal redox charges.									20	0	0	0	3	0	20			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000654761100001	33830603

In recent years, Co and Ni-based materials have been explored as excellent choices in highly efficient and affordable noble metal-free catalysts. Herein, a heterostructure of NiCo alloy and phosphide (NiCo/NiCoP) hybrid is prepared by using hydrothermal and calcination method. This hybrid catalyst manifests outstanding OER electrocatalytic performance, as demonstrated by an ultralow Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1), low overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and long-term chemical stability. Benefiting from the incorporation of nitrogen atom, surface oxygen vacancies, and synergistic coupling effect between alloy and phosphide, the hybrid catalyst can expose more accessible active sites and facilitate the release of oxygen bubbles. Our findings demonstrated that this bimetallic alloy/phosphide hybrid can serve as an efficient and durable electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A number of nickel (Ni)-based heterogeneous catalysts have been designed and synthesized to lower the overpotentials for large current densities due to low cost and facile synthesis. Herein, recent progress on Ni-based composites functioning on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and overall water splitting is summarized. The synthesis strategies, structure design and performance analysis of Ni-based heterostructured catalysts are thoroughly discussed, aiming to promote the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts that may ultimately replace the noble-metal based catalysts and bring water splitting into the practical application.									38	1	0	0	1	0	38			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000517212500008

Here we report that the nitrogen-doped carbon materials function as the efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. In alkaline media, the material generated a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotential of 0.38 V, values that are comparable to those of iridium and cobalt oxide catalysts and are the best among the non-metal oxygen evolution electrocatalyst. The electrochemical and physical studies indicate that the high oxygen evolution activity of the nitrogen/carbon materials is from the pyridinic-nitrogen- or/and quaternary-nitrogen-related active sites.

Herein, we demonstrate the construction of the CoS2 nanosheets assembled three-dimensional hierarchical microboxes by a facile solvothermal process and subsequent sulfurization, where the porous building blocks are cross-linked by numerous nanoparticles. Such attractive nanostructures facilitate sufficient exposure of electrocatalytic active sites with rapid ions transfer. The as-obtained CoS2 microboxes exhibit excellent oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalytic performance with a small overpotential of only 308 mV in 1.0 mol L-1 KOH solution to achieve a current density of 10 mAcm(-2), which is much lower than the CoS2 nanoparticles (336 mV) and the CoS2 nanosheets aggregations (339mV). The Tafel slope is as low as 41.4mV dec(-1). Furthermore, they also show a negligible overpotential change during 8 h chronopotentiometry measurement.

Ni (oxy)hydroxide is active for the oxygen evolution reaction. The Ni (oxy)hydroxide directly formed on the surface of Ni foam as a binder-free catalyst not only exhibited large electrochemically active area, but also displayed low interfacial electronic resistance and low charge transfer resistance. Therefore, the optimized Ni (oxy) hydroxide exhibits an overpotential of 288 and 370 mV at 10 and 500 mA cm(-2), respectively, in 1.0 M KOH for the oxygen evolution reaction, as well as favorable during 240 h at 100 mA cm(-2).

In this short review we discuss how, with the advent of new experimental and computational methodologies, the OER can be treated with increasingly sophisticated models to aid in our complete understanding.

Herein, we provide a rational design whereby the cobalt phosphide particles are introduced into molybdenum sulfide nanosheets to form a heterostructure (MoS2 parallel to CoP) through the ultrasonic method and calcination. Subsequently, N, P-doped carbon (NPC) is obtained synchronously. The as-prepared MoS2 parallel to CoP/NPC demonstrates highly effective multifunctional catalytic performance for oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reaction at lower overpotential, as well as oxygen reduction reaction at high half-wave potential. What this reveals is higher power density and superior stability in zinc-air battery. The excellent electrocatalytic activity of MoS2 parallel to CoP/NPC may be attributed to the presence of the MoS2 parallel to CoP heterostructure, as well as N, P-doped carbon coupled with a high percentage of pyridinic-N. This work proposes a novel and facile strategy to prepare the heterostructure compound and serves as a good reference for constructing efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts.

A connection between the problematics of the oxygen electrode reaction in nonaqueous media and the developing of novel batteries, in the first place, Li-O-2 batteries, is emphasized. Unlike aqueous solutions, the oxygen reduction in aprotic electrolytes was shown to occur without breaking of the O-O bond; it is accompanied by formation of poorly soluble product of two-electron reaction (Li2O2) in the pores of positive electrode. The effect of the solvent donor number and the anion composition on the oxygen reduction mechanism and the lithium peroxide deposit structure is described. A marked reduction of the Li2O2 oxidation overvoltage when passing from carbonaceous materials to platinum-containing catalysts in the positive electrode is elucidated; in the latter case, the effect of electrocatalyst type upon the Li2O2 formation reaction is somewhat reduced. The elucidation of the contribution of processes occurring at the free and lithium-peroxide-covered electrode surface during the oxygen reaction for wide variety of active materials is formulated as the main basic problem of the future research.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1023-1935	1608-3342		WOS:000427141000001

However, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) usually determines the efficiency of practical water electrolysis due to its sluggish four-electron process. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have attracted increasing attention as one of the ideal and promising electrocatalysts for water oxidation due to their excellent activity, high stability in basic conditions, as well as their earth-abundant compositions. In this review, we discuss the recent progress on LDH-based OER electrocatalysts in terms of active sites, host-guest engineering, and catalytic performances. Moreover, further developments and challenges in developing promising electrocatalysts based on LDHs are discussed from the viewpoint of molecular design and engineering.									19	6	0	0	1	0	21			2073-4344			WOS:000435191500043

Due to cost, slow reaction kinetics and associated poisoning issues with noble metal catalysts, a substantial amount of research have been focused on non-noble metal structured oxides, where the solid state structure coupled with its unique surface properties have demonstrated low overpotentials and high current densities with fascinating chemistry and potential to commercialization. The transition metal oxides with cubic rock salt, spinel and perovskite structures have been the interest of research for many years for methanol oxidation reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. However, in spite of significant studies, there is not a single monograph on compiling and critically comparing the mechanism and performances of these two electrocatalytic oxidation reactions over structured oxides. This review probes the mechanism and efficiency of methanol oxidation reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in light of solid state structures, anionic vacancies, corresponding surface morphologies and electronic configurations of oxide catalysts.

The results suggested that in tetrabutyl-ammonium-ion(TBA(+))-containing electrolytes, the electrochemical reactions were reversible reactions of one-electron transfer; while in lithium-ion( Li+)-containing electrolyte, multiple-electrons transfer occurred during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Powder microelectrodes of super P and conductive acetylene black were used as working electrodes to conduct electrochemical experiments. The results showed the ORRs were similar, but the OER had differences on these two materials. Besides, Tafel analyses indicated that during the ORR, one-electron transfer always took place at first whether in different non-aqueous solvents or on different cathodes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0251-0790			WOS:000399425200020

The advantage of the alkaline environment allows such technologies to utilize several low-cost and efficient non-noble transition metal oxides. Particularly, perovskite oxides (POs) of high intrinsic catalytic activity and tunable crystal structures have shown exceptional bifunctionality characteristics in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)/OER in the aforementioned system. This review focuses on the recent advancement of POs electrocatalyst in the fundamental reaction mechanism and the key factors for the catalytic improvement.

However, the oxygen electrode reactions suffer from sluggish kinetics, large overpotential and complicated reaction paths, and thus require efficient and stable electrocatalysts. Transition-metal-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and their derivatives have displayed excellent catalytic performance, suggesting a major contribution to accelerate electrochemical reactions. The rational regulation of electronic structure, defects, and coordination environment of active sites via various functionalized strategies, including tuning the chemical composition, structural architecture, and topotactic transformation process of LDHs precursors, has a great influence on the resulting electrocatalytic behavior. In addition, an in-depth understanding of the structural performance and chemical-composition-performance relationships of LDHs-based electrocatalysts can promote further rational design and optimization of high-performance electrocatalysts. Finally, prospects for the design of efficient and stable LDHs-based materials, for mass-production and large-scale application in practice, are discussed.									5	0	0	0	0	0	4				2073-4344		WOS:000727886000001

The inner Co metal cores serve as highly conductive layers to provide reliable electronic transmission, and can overcome the poor electrical conductivity of FeOOH efficiently. DFT calculations demonstrate the strong electronic interactions between Co and FeOOH in the FeOOH/Co/FeOOH HNTAs, and the hybrid structure can lower the energy barriers of intermediates and thus promote the catalytic reactions. The FeOOH/Co/FeOOH HNTAs exhibit high electrocatalytic performance for OER, such as low onset potential, small Tafel slope, and excellent long-term durability, and they are promising electrocatalysts for OER in alkaline solution.									508	32	0	0	30	0	513			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000371521000027	26879125

The kinetics for the redox couple O-2/O-2(center dot-) are very fast, therefore no catalyst seems necessary to assist the charge transfer process. Apparently, the main source of the overpotential for the O-2 reduction reaction is from mass diffusion. Li2O2 becomes soluble in non-aqueous electrolytes in the presence of the tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate additive. The soluble B - O-2(2-) ions can be oxidized electro-catalytically. The edge orientation of graphite demonstrates superior catalytic activity for the oxidation over basal orientation. The findings reveal an opportunity for recharging Li-air batteries efficiently and a new strategy of developing the catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, we report a high-performance self-supported AuNi-Cu2O hybrid, which works as a bi-functional electrocatalyst for ORR and OER. The as-prepared AuNi-Cu2O hybrid exhibits excellent catalytic activity, the ORR activity of which is superior to that of commercial Pt/C, and the OER activity of which is close to that of commercial IrO2/C. Moreover, AuNi-Cu2O hybrid exhibits better durability than commercial Pt/C and IrO2/C. The excellent catalytic performance of AuNi-Cu2O could be attributed to the increase of active sites and the strong "mutual" interaction between Au and Ni induced by leaching of CU2O.

Here we show a unique solution to improve the oxygen evolution reaction rate by adjusting the electrolyte composition via the introduction of hexadecyltrimethylammonium hydroxide into an alkaline electrolyte. The strong adsorption of hexadecyltrimethylammonium cations on the surface of electrocatalysts provides the increased absolute number of OH- ions near the electrocatalyst surface, which effectively promotes the oxygen evolution reaction performance of electrocatalysts, such as Fe1-yNiyS2@Fe1-xNixOOH microplatelets and SrBaNi2Fe12O22 powders. Meanwhile, we present an electrochemical conditioning approach to engineering the electrochemically active surface area of electrocatalysts, by which the resultant Fe1-yNiyS2@Fe1-xNixOOH microplatelets have a larger electrochemically active surface area after the electrochemical conditioning of the as-synthesized Fe1-yNiyS2 microplatelets using ammonia borane than those obtained after the conventional electrochemical conditioning without ammonia borane, presumably due to the appropriate conversion rate of Fe1-xNixOOH shells. Methods to overcome the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction are desirable for a range of renewable energy technologies. Here the authors demonstrate that the rate of oxygen evolution is enhanced upon introduction of hexadecyltrimethylammonium hydroxide into the alkaline electrolyte.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2399-3669			WOS:000591665900003

Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)											10.1002/anie.202213522				2022-Oct-14	2022	Construction of catalytic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is significant but rarely demonstrated. In this work, we have first constructed bifunctional COFs towards ORR and OER by integrating diarylamine derivatives into the Co-porphyrin based frameworks. Both of the new COFs (CoTAPP-PATA-COF and CoTAPP-BDTA-COF) have good ordered structures, high surface areas, and robust chemical stability. The diarylamine units, as a typical electron donor and redox-active cores, promote intramolecular electron transport along the frameworks and improve the electrochemically active surface areas. Thus, the COFs showed higher catalytic activities than that of the COF without redox-active units. CoTAPP-PATA-COF had a halfwave potential of 0.80 V towards ORR, and delieved an overpotential of 420 mV for OER in 0.1 M KOH. The theoretical calculation revealed introducing diarylamine unites improved the oxygen electrocatalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1521-3773		MEDLINE:36240790	36240790

For water splitting, transition-metal dichalcogenides have attracted great interest as advanced catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction, but there has been no sincere attention to generate significant anodic current density of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with these materials. Addressing this unmet need, here, the outstanding catalytic performance of MoS2 and TaS2 in OER is demonstrated. Chemically exfoliated 2D thin sheets of MoS2 and TaS2, in both of their 1T and 2H polymorph, have been employed for OER catalysis in acid medium. The best performance for oxygen evolution, which is also comparable to benchmark IrO2, comes out from 1T-MoS2 followed by 1T-TaS2, 2H-MoS2, and 2H-TaS2. Theoretical study reveals that the dominant catalytic activity is on edge sites instead of surface and corroborates the experimental results of polymorphic dependence of electrocatalytic activity. The materials have also shown moderate durability in the harsh acidic medium. The study brings up new set of electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution in acid regime that hitherto has remained largely unrevealed.									110	5	0	0	3	0	110			2196-7350			WOS:000378885300011

During the past several years, significant advances have been made in the direct applications of pristine 2D MOF nanosheets as efficient electrocatalysts. This review first discusses the synthetic strategies of MOF nanosheets. Then recent progress on pristine MOF nanosheets for electrocatalytic reactions, including the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CRR) and the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is summarized. In particular, engineering electronic structures of pristine MOF nanosheets to favor efficient electrocatalytic processes are discussed. Despite the encouraging accomplishments achieved, more engineered pristine MOF nanosheets with enhanced electrocatalytic performance are still needed. Therefore, bottlenecks faced by current pristine MOF nanosheets for electrocatalysis and potential solutions to these problems are finally proposed to promote further development in this research field.									109	8	0	0	5	0	111			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000533422400001

Therefore, it is important to develop bifunctional electrocatalysts with cheap and high-efficient characteristics. However, traditional bifunctional catalysts usually exhibit high overpotential and poor stability during both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we synthesized several kinds of CoP nanorod catalysts through a facile hydrothermal method and subsequent thermal phosphorization process. The as-obtained CoP-1.5 product showed an overpotential of 58 mV for HER at 10 mA cm(-2) and 284 mV for OER at 50 mV cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. Moreover, the bifunctional catalyst, delivered a cell voltage of 1.66 Vat 50 mA cm(-2).									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1566-7367	1873-3905		WOS:000821316400004

Among the series of TiO2C@CNx nanosheets, the TiO2C@CNx,950 (obtained by calcination at 950 degrees C) hybrid exhibits robust trifunctional electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by combining the excellent electrochemical activity of the graphene-like nanostructure and the high electrocatalytic performances of TiO2 nanoparticles. When TiO2C@CNx,950 is used as the electrocatalyst for water splitting, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (E-j = 10) is achieved at a low cell voltage of 1.50 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. Meanwhile, the overall oxygen activity of the TiO2C@CNx,950 exhibits good reversible oxygen reaction, giving a small potential difference between the E-j = 10 for OER and the half-wave potential for ORR (0.75 V). Moreover, a simply equipped Zn-air battery is assembled using a homemade cathode, showing open-circuit potential of 1.344 V, which also can supplied an electrical power and produced H-2 at the cathode and O-2 at the anode. Consequently, this work can pave a path for developing multifunctional electrocatalysts for water spitting and liquid Zn-air battery.									161	6	0	0	8	0	163			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000463126200037

Three Mn complexes among them are new and are reported for the first time. The reactions of oxygen evolution in the presence of oxone (2KHSO(5)center dot KHSO4 center dot K2SO4) and cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate catalyzed by these complexes are studied and characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction spectrometry, dynamic light scattering, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, membrane-inlet mass spectrometry and electrochemistry. Some of these complexes evolve oxygen in the presence of oxone as a primary oxidant. CO2 and MnO4- are other products of these reactions. Based on spectroscopic studies, the true catalysts for oxygen evolution in these reactions are different. We proposed that for the oxygen evolution reactions in the presence of oxone, the true catalysts are both high valent Mn complexes and Mn oxides, but for the reactions in the presence of cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate, the active catalyst is most probably a Mn oxide.									43	0	0	0	8	0	43			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000341064100037	25046248

DEMS is used to identify products and intermediates of the reaction monitored online during the potential sweep. The measurements show that the oxidation of both methanol and formic acid proceeds close to the potential of the oxygen evolution reaction, resulting in the appearance of an oxidation wave. During the oxidation, the oxygen evolution reaction shifts toward a higher potential, i.e., becomes a secondary reaction. Depending on the potential, either the formation of intermediates (partial oxidation) or the complete mineralization of organics, simultaneous with oxygen evolution, is observed. Diffusion limitation of the oxidation is clearly observed in parallel to the increase in O(2) formation. Methylformate is formed from methanol at potentials at which the local concentration of OH radicals is not sufficient for a complete mineralization. Formic acid oxidation proceeds in two waves; before the onset of oxygen evolution, an intermediate (probably oxalic acid) is produced in parallel to CO(2) formation. Only in parallel to oxygen evolution is mineralization to CO(2) is complete. (C) 2009 The Electrochemical Society.

Facets with distinct surface coordination that exhibit a central role in the kinetics modulation (reactivity) of surface electrochemistry, have remained elusive in oxygen evolution reactions (OERs). Here, the relationship between the predominant facets and catalytic reactivity is revealed, and it is recognized that facets decisively govern the oxygen evolution activity descriptor in hematite nanocrystals. Specifically, the hematite shows facet-dependent activity that follows the computed binding energy of surface-oxygenated intermediates. Moreover, a lower kinetics energy barrier is observed on a highly coordinated surface, both experimentally and computationally, in the light of molecular orbital principles. Consequently, a record-low overpotential and Tafel slope in iron oxides toward OER are manifested, competing against the benchmark binary transition metal oxide electrocatalysts and expelling the stereotype of the passive oxygen evolution activity of iron oxides. Significantly, the identification of facet-governing reactivity, construction of favorable facets, and strategic regulation of surface covalency enlighten design strategies for highly active catalysts.									69	4	0	0	4	0	69			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000454124800011	30387194

Although such corrections are tacit in the model, they should not be overlooked. In this article, we calculate the errors in the total energy of oxygen for commonly used exchange-correlation functionals, PW91, RPBE, PBE, and BEEF-vdW, to show that, for all functionals tested, the error is at least 0.3 eV. We discuss the impact this sizeable error in oxygen has on the modelling of the ORR and the OER. The error due to oxygen affects not only the overall equilibrium potential of the reaction, but also the energies of individual mechanistic steps. This illustrates that understanding the reasoning behind the semiempirical corrections for oxygen is important for researching new catalysts which may have different potential limiting steps.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000696793500020

These heterostructures synergistically favoured the reduction of the energy barrier of the initial water dissociation step and optimization of the subsequent H adsorption/desorption for MoS2 in alkaline HER. Moreover, the adsorption of oxygen intermediates was enhanced for Co3O4 in the OER process.

As indicated by UV-Vis spectroscopy, immobilization of the manganese compounds greatly altered the electronic properties due to strong interactions with the clay surfaces. When studied for their ability to catalyze oxygen formation upon reactions with the strong oxygen-transferring oxidants H2O2 and oxone, it was found that surface adsorption yielded catalysts of improved performance for oxygen formation in aqueous media. Both the rates of oxygen evolution and catalyst stabilities were significantly increased for the clay hybrids of most complexes in comparison to homogeneous solutions of the compounds. Additionally, four heterogeneous systems were also found to catalyze the evolution of O-2 in reactions with the non-oxygen transferring, single-electron oxidation agent Ce-IV-a reaction not observed for any dinuclear manganese complex in homogeneous reaction. Implications of these observations concerning the mechanism of oxygen formation and the development of manganese-based water oxidation catalysts are discussed.									36	0	0	0	4	0	36			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000268438800006	20449104

Here, we synthesized a novel S-CoSe2/CoMoO4 and O-CoSe2/CoMoO4 hybrid electrocatalysts for the HER and OER, respectively.

Here, we propose an interface and oxygen vacancy engineering strategy to integrate subtle lattice distortions, oxygen vacancies, and nanopores on the surface of NixCo1-xSe2-O interface nanocrystals, which exhibit efficient bifunctional catalytic performances for oxygen evolution and reduction. The results from X-ray absorption spectroscopy and electron spin resonance spectroscopy demonstrate that the defect structure can enlarge the number of active sites for electrocatalytic performances. Flexible Zn-air battery using NixCo1-xSe2-O as a cathode displays large specific capacity and remarkable stability even after twisting at any angle, thus showing potential for wearable and portable electronic device application.

X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electrons microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, were investigated for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid media. Three stability testing protocols are used to evaluate the catalysts stabilities, comprising electrode cycling in the ORR, OER, and ORR OER potential ranges. Electrochemical results provide evidence that a Pt/IrO2 1:9 material exhibits better balance between the OER and ORR mass activities and that cycling in the ORR-OER potential window is the most aggressive aging protocol for the Pt/IrO2 materials. Identical location transmission electron microscopy is used to investigate the aging processes taking part in the Pt/IrO2 catalysts. In addition to dissolution processes, particle coalescence, growth, and detachment are confirmed as responsible for the Pt/IrO2 instability.									118	4	0	0	6	0	118			2155-5435			WOS:000426804100054		
J	Marshall, Aaron T.; Herritsch, Alfred								Understanding how the oxygen evolution reaction kinetics influences electrochemical wastewater oxidation								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				282				448	458		10.1016/j.electacta.2018.06.065				AUG 20 2018	2018	The electrochemical oxidation of organic species in wastewater often occurs in parallel with the oxygen evolution reaction. At electrocatalytic anodes (e.g. IrO2), the organic species is oxidized by the surface bound oxygen species, S-O, an intermediate of the oxygen evolution reaction. Previously, the rate of organic oxidation by the S-O species has been assumed to be much faster than the combination of SeO to form O-2, but here a model is developed without this assumption and solved numerically for a wide range of rate constants to determine steady-state polarisation curves for oxygen evolution and the rate of the oxidation of organics. Experimental oxygen evolution polarisation curves measured on IrO2 anodes are fit to a model for the electrochemical oxide pathway to understand how the kinetics of the individual steps in the oxygen evolution reaction influence the rate of oxidation of organics. Multiple sets of rate constants describe the same steady-state polarisation curve with unique surface oxide coverage vs. potential behaviour. While this complicates the extraction of rate constants from oxygen evolution polarisation curves, it enables the study of influence of S-OH and SeO surface coverages on the organic oxidation rate while keeping the overall oxygen evolution kinetics constant. By comparing the organic oxidation over a range of kinetic parameters, it can be concluded that the organic oxidation reaction only alters the current density when the organic oxidation rate constant is many times larger than the rate constant for the competing step in the oxygen evolution reaction. Our model also shows that organics can be oxidized with by molecular O-2 via an SeO mediated process, although as this only occurs when the organic oxidation rate constant is very large and at low overpotentials where the specific oxidation rate is very low. The model also shows that organic oxidation reaction is almost entirely kinetically limited at low overpotentials and only becomes mass transport limited when the rate constant for the organic oxidation reaction is extremely large. The model is validated by comparing simulations against data for 4-nitrophenol oxidation at a 90 wt% SnO2-Sb2O5-10 wt% IrO2 anode and is shown to correctly describe the potential dependence of the apparent first-order rate constant. From this, we conclude that only one type of surface coverage behaviour can describe the experimental results and that the specific rate constant for 4-nitrophenol oxidation on this anode is approximately 2.3 x 10(4) cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1).

In recent years, metal@carbon core@shell nanocomposites have emerged as a unique class of functional nanomaterials that show apparent electrocatalytic activity towards a range of reactions, such as hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, and CO2 reduction reaction, that are important in water splitting, fuel cells and metal-air batteries. The activity is primarily attributed to interfacial charge transfer from the metal core to the carbon shell that manipulate the electronic interactions between the catalyst surface and reaction intermediates, and varies with the structures and morphologies of the metal core (elemental composition, core size, etc.) and carbon shell (doping, layer thickness, etc.). Further manipulation can be achieved by the incorporation of a third structural component. A perspective is also included highlighting the current gap between theoretical modeling and experimental results, and technical challenges for future research.

A current density of 50 mA cm(-2) is driven at an overpotential of 160 mV for oxygen evolution reaction, and a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is driven at an overpotential of 117 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction. In a two-electrode system, only a cell voltage of 1.49 V is required to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is almost one of the best catalysts reported so far.

Because of the successful fabrication of distinctive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts, bifunctional ORR/OER and HER/OER electrocatalysts have become a hot area of contemporary research. ORR, OER, and HER have gained considerable attention because of their strong performance in different energy conversion and storage devices, including water-splitting devices, fuel cells, and metal-air rechargeable batteries.

Constructing amorphous structure and the interface between amorphous and crystal can obviously improve the conductivity of FeOxH, which is beneficial to the improvement of catalytic performance.

The problem of long preparation route of the existing method for producing high sodium sulfate is solved. The production energy consumption is effectively reduced. The product decomposition at low temperature is reduced. The added oxygen evolution inhibitor can effectively improve the high potential of oxygen evolution and does not influence the target reaction, so that target reaction is carried out smoothly. If the boron-doped diamond electrode is selected as the anode, the need to continue adding oxygen evolution inhibitor is avoided. Because the electrochemical window of boron-doped diamond electrode in the acidic environment is very wide, the precipitation potential of oxygen on the boron-doped diamond is higher than the reaction potential of high sulfate.

Activity and durability of iridium nanoparticles in the oxygen evolution reaction								ECS Transactions				69	17			883	92		10.1149/06917.0883ecst				2015	2015	Unsupported iridium (Ir) nanoparticles, a benchmark catalyst in acidic electrolyzers, are investigated for oxygen evolution activity in rotating disk electrode (RDE) half-cells. Mercury underpotential deposition, used to evaluate the electrochemical surface areas (ECAs) of Ir, produces similar values prior to and following oxygen evolution testing and irreversible surface oxidation; stable ECA measurements allow for the study of site-specific activities prior to and following accelerated stress tests. Durability testing results in increasing activity losses due to particle growth at moderate potential and Ir dissolution at higher potential. Although the prolonged formation of oxygen bubbles may destabilize the catalyst layer, accelerated stress tests in hydrogen peroxide and formic acid confirm that the losses are primarily potential dependent. This study establishes RDE testing protocols for Ir in oxygen evolution. The observed durability losses have significant implications on acidic electrolyzers, particularly at low Ir loadings.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1938-5862			INSPEC:15991710

Phase-pure Ca2Mn2O5 was made under mild reaction temperatures through a reductive annealing method. This oxygen deficient perovskite can catalyze the generation of oxygen at similar to 1.50 V versus (vs) reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) electrochemically, and reach an OER mass activity of 30.1 A/g at 1.70 V (vs RHE). In comparison to the perovskite CaMnO3, Ca2Mn2O5 shows higher OER activities. The molecular level oxygen vacancies and high spin electron configuration on manganese in the crystal structures are likely the contributing factors for the enhanced performance. This work demonstrates that oxygen-deficient perovskite, A(2)B(2)O(5), is a new class of high performance electrocatalyst for those reactions that involve active oxygen intermediates, such as reduction of oxygen and OER in water splitting.									349	13	0	0	30	0	355			0002-7863			WOS:000343686500004	25295698

Although alkaline conditions extend the scope of electrocatalysts beyond precious metal-based materials to earth-abundant materials, the sluggish kinetics of cathodic and anodic reactions (hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively) impede the development of practical electrocatalysts that do not use precious metals. This review discusses the rational design of efficient electrocatalysts by exploiting the understanding of alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction mechanisms and of the electron structure-activity relationship, as achieved by combining experimental and computational approaches. The enhancement of water splitting not only deals with intrinsic catalytic activity but also includes the aspect of electrical conductivity and stability. Future perspectives to increase the synergy between theory and experiment are also proposed.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2516-0230			WOS:000718426100001	36132358

Herein, three dimensional core-branch Ni3S2/Co9S8 arrays are directly grown on Ni foam by controllably sulfidizing NiCo-precursor with different concentrations of sulfur source. The unique core-branch Ni3S2/Co9S8 arrays provide large surface active areas for electrochemical reactions, open channels for effective gas release and intimate contact with Ni foam for fast electron transport. Serving as a free-standing electrocatalytic electrode, the as-synthesized Ni3S2/Co9S8 arrays show outstanding catalytic activity with an overpotential of 340 mV and 269 mV for oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, respectively. Moreover, Ni3S2/Co9S8 works as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, where the low cell voltage of 1.55 Vat 10 mA cm(-2) and good cycling performance can be successfully achieved. This work provides a facile strategy to construct core-branch nanostructures for an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.									48	2	0	0	2	0	49			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000449444500038

Perovskite (ABO3) and spinel (AB2O4) oxides stand out against other structures due to the possibility of tailoring their chemical composition and, consequently, their properties. Particularly, the elec-trocatalytic performance of these materials depends on features such as chemical composition, crystal structure, nanostructure, cation substitution level, eg orbital filling or oxygen vacancies. However, they suffer from low electrical conductivity and surface area, which affects the catalytic response. To mitigate these drawbacks, they have been combined with carbon materials (e.g. carbon black, carbon nanotubes, activated carbon, and gra-phene) that positively influence the overall catalytic activity. This review provides an overview on tunable perovskites (mainly lanthanum-based) and spinels featuring 3d metal cations such as Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu on octahedral sites, which are known to be active for the electrochemical energy conversion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-9351	1096-0953		WOS:000838026400004	35753372

The catalytic activity of HER and OER towards 2D CoOOH was studiedbycalculating the Gibbs free energy. Our study revealedthat the 2DCoOOH serve better as a catalyst for HER than OER with adsorption energy of -0.45 and -3.68 eV respectively suggesting its efficient use for hydrogen production.

The electrocatalyst (Y1.75Ca0.25Ru2O7) optimized by oxygen vacancy engineering demonstrates superior electrocatalytic activity and durability for both oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction. For PEMWE, it achieves 1.25 A cm(-2) under a cell voltage of 1.7 V at 60 degrees C and operates stably for more than 1000 min at 60 degrees C. For ZAB, Y1.75Ca0.25Ru2O7 operates stably over 6400 min and degrades only slightly. Our results reveal that partial Ca2+ replacement of Y3+ in Y2Ru2O7 promotes the hole doping effect, and thus enhances the oxygen vacancy concentration and hybrid valence of Ru4+/Ru5+, which are strongly associated with the electrochemical performance of oxygen electrocatalysts. This work paves a new avenue for developing active and robust oxygen electrocatalysts for both PEMWE and ZAB.									33	2	0	0	1	0	34			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000496894300031

As improved stability of Ru catalysts has been shown for bulk surfaces with low-index facets, there is an opportunity to incorporate these stable facets into Ru nanoparticles. Now, a new solution synthesis is presented in which hexagonal close-packed structured Ru is grown on Au to form nanoparticles with 3D branches. Exposing low-index facets on these 3D branches creates stable reaction kinetics to achieve high activity and the highest stability observed for Ru nanoparticle oxygen evolution reaction catalysts.

The development of low-cost, highly efficient and stable bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts is critical for a large-scale application of this technology. In this review, the authors first introduce the fundamentals of bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysis in alkaline electrolyte. Various types of nanostructured materials as bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts including metal oxide, hydroxide and sulfide, functional carbon material, metal, and their composites are then reviewed. The crucial factors that can be used to tune the activity of the catalyst towards ORR/OER are summarized, including (1) phase, morphology, crystal facet, defect, mixed-metal and strain engineering for metal oxide; (2) heteroatom doping, topological defects, and formation of metal-N-C structure for carbon material; (3) alloy effect for metal. These experiences lay the foundation for large scale application of metal-air battery and can also effectively guide the rational design of catalysts for other electrocatalytic reactions.									427	21	0	0	9	0	430			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000423878500009

For applications within catalysis, the different local atomic environments result in a distribution of binding energies for the catalytic intermediates. Using the oxygen evolution reaction on the rutile (110) surface as example, here we outline a strategy for the theoretical optimization of the composition. Density functional theory calculations performed for a limited number of sites are used to fit a model that predicts the reaction energies for all possible local atomic environments. Two reaction pathways are considered; the conventional pathway on the coordinatively unsaturated sites and an alternative pathway involving transfer of protons to a bridging oxygen. An explicit model of the surface is constructed to describe the interdependency of the two pathways and identify the composition that maximizes catalytic activity.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000767054700001	35225378

Herein, the Co4S3/NSG-NaCl catalyst is prepared via a NaCl-guided hydrothermal method. Control experiments by replacing NaCl with KCI, KBr, NaNO3, CaCl2 and NaBr reveal that NaCl promotes a more efficient oxygen electrode catalysis results due to its high affinity and high ionicity. By varying the amount of the raw materials, optimized compositions are contained in the catalyst. Physical characterization indicates the optimized catalyst is of high specific BET surface area (similar to 181 m(2) g(-1)) and porous structure, which enable to expose more active sites, and facilitate more rapid mass transfer at the interface of gas-liquid-solid. XPS measurements suggest the formation of pyridinic N, graphitic N, Co N and Co S active species. Stemming from the synergistic effects between Co4S3 and nitrogen and sulfur dual-doped graphene, the optimized Co4S3/NSG-NaCl hybrid show excellent catalytic activity and stability for both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction under corrosive media.

Herein, the leading strategies for the preparation of single atom catalysts are summarized, and the electrocatalytic performance of the resulting samples for the various reactions is discussed. In general, the carbon substrate not only provides a stabilizing matrix for the metal atoms, but also impacts the electronic density of the metal atoms due to strong interfacial interactions, which may lead to the formation of additional active sites by the adjacent carbon atoms and hence enhanced electrocatalytic activity. This necessitates a detailed understanding of the material structures at the atomic level, a critical step in the construction of a relevant structural model for theoretical simulations and calculations.

J	Exner, Kai S.								Design criteria for the competing chlorine and oxygen evolution reactions: avoid the OCl adsorbate to enhance chlorine selectivity								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				22	39			22451	22458		10.1039/d0cp03667f				OCT 21 2020	2020	The formation of gaseous chlorine within chlor-alkali electrolysis is accompanied by a selectivity problem, as the evolution of gaseous oxygen constitutes a detrimental side reaction in the same potential range. As such, the development of electrode materials with high selectivity toward the chlorine evolution reaction is of particular importance to the chemical industry. Insight into the elementary reaction steps is ultimately required to comprehend chlorine selectivity on a molecular level. Commonly, linear scaling relationships are analyzed by the construction of a volcano plot, using the binding energy of oxygen, Delta E-O, as a descriptor in the analysis. The present article reinvestigates the selectivity problem of the competing chlorine and oxygen evolution reactions by applying a different strategy compared to previous literature studies. On the one hand, a unifying material-screening framework that, besides binding energies, also includes the applied overpotential, kinetics, and the electrochemical-step symmetry index is used to comprehend trends in this selectivity issue for transition-metal oxide-based electrodes. On the other hand, the free-energy difference between the adsorbed oxygen and adsorbed hydroxide, Delta G(2), rather than Delta E-O is used as a descriptor in the analysis. It is demonstrated that the formation of the OCl adsorbate within the chlorine evolution reaction inherently limits chlorine selectivity, whereas, in the optimum case, the formation of the Cl intermediate can result in significantly higher chlorine selectivity. This finding is used to derive the design criteria for highly selective chlorine evolution electrocatalysts, which can be used in the future to search for potential electrode compositions by material-screening techniques.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000581179800027	32996945

The common approach in the development of oxygen evolution catalysts is to search for catalytic materials with new and optimized chemical compositions and structures. Here we report an orthogonal approach to improve the activity of catalysts without alternating their compositions or structures. Specifically, liquid phase exfoliation is applied to enhance the oxygen evolution activity of layered double hydroxides. The exfoliated single-layer nanosheets exhibit significantly higher oxygen evolution activity than the corresponding bulk layered double hydroxides in alkaline conditions. The nanosheets from nickel iron and nickel cobalt layered double hydroxides outperform a commercial iridium dioxide catalyst in both activity and stability. The exfoliation creates more active sites and improves the electronic conductivity. This work demonstrates the promising catalytic activity of single-layered double hydroxides for the oxygen evolution reaction.									1623	104	0	0	91	0	1651			2041-1723			WOS:000340623400022	25030209

The development of a multifunctional electrocatalyst composed of nitrogen, phosphorus, and fluorine tri-doped graphene is reported, which was obtained by thermal activation of a mixture of polyaniline-coated graphene oxide and ammonium hexafluorophosphate (AHF). It was found that thermal decomposition of AHF provides nitrogen, phosphorus, and fluorine sources for tri-doping with N, P, and F, and simultaneously facilitates template-free formation of porous structures as a result of thermal gas evolution. The resultant N, P, and F tri-doped graphene exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activities for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The trifunctional metal-free catalyst was further used as an OER-HER bifunctional catalyst for oxygen and hydrogen gas production in an electrochemical water-splitting unit, which was powered by an integrated Zn-air battery based on an air electrode made from the same electrocatalyst for ORR.

In this study, we report that the correlation between the calcination temperature and the bifunctional catalytic activity of BRO in a KOH aqueous solution. BRO was prepared by the co-precipitation method in aqueous medium using Bi(NO3)(3), RuCl3, and NaOH and following the calcination at 500-700 degrees C. The characterization was carried out by synchrotron XRD and temperature-programmed reduction technique. It was found that the oxygen contents of BRO decreased with rising the calcination temperature. The catalytic behavior of BRO towards ORR and OER was evaluated by hydrodynamic voltammetry using a rotating disk electrode and a rotating ring-disk electrode technique. Tafel slopes for the ORR and OER decreased with an increase in the calcination temperature from 500 to 600 degrees C, while the onset potentials for both reactions were almost same. The results of this study suggest that the oxygen content of BRO is one of the factors that determine the catalytic activity for the oxygen electrode reactions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000426955500003

Herein we report iridium-containing strontium titanates (Ir-STO) as active and stable, low-iridium perovskite electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid. The Ir-STO contains 57wt% less iridium relative to the benchmark catalyst IrO2, but it exhibits more than 10times higher catalytic activity for OER. It is shown to be among the most efficient iridium-based oxide electrocatalysts for OER in acid. Theoretical results reveal that the incorporation of iridium dopants in the STO matrix activates the intrinsically inert titanium sites, strengthening the surface oxygen adsorption on titanium sites and thereby giving nonprecious titanium catalytic sites that have activities close to or even better than iridium sites.									115	8	0	0	5	0	114			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000474804800011	30775830

The ionic liquid is functionalized with NO3 (-) anions, which decompose and release gases during the pyrolysis process, facilitating the formation of a carbon foam. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy analyses show that the carbon foam is composed of curved carbon nanosheets with the maximum thickness of 70 nm. The favorable compositional (nitrogen doping to provide catalytically active sites) and morphological (curved nanosheet architecture to increase the contact area between electrolytes and catalytically active sites) characteristics make the present carbon powders a potential metal-free electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. As expected, the nitrogen-doped and curved carbon nanosheets exhibit a considerable activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction as well as a moderate ability for catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction in KOH solutions.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000396116800008

Decoupled electrolysis for water splitting								CURRENT OPINION IN GREEN AND SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY				29						100453	10.1016/j.cogsc.2021.100453		FEB 2021		JUN 2021	2021	Decoupled electrolysis provides a means by which to run the oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions of water splitting in different places, at different times and/or at rates that are not linked to each other. As a result, the gaseous products of water splitting can be kept separate, and the rate of the (more valuable) hydrogen evolution process can be freed from its dependence on the rate of the (generally more sluggish) oxygen evolution reaction. Decoupled water electrolysis, therefore, has significant potential benefits for the sustainable production of hydrogen from water driven by intermittent renewable power sources. In this Current Opinion article, we give an overview of recent progress in the field of decoupled electrolytic water splitting (with a particular emphasis on the years 2018-2020) and discuss some of the future prospects of this rapidly-developing area.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2452-2236			WOS:000659958300012

Though electrochemical and photoelectrochemcial water oxidation have been incorporated in such a two-step water splitting system, alternative ways to reduce the cost and energy input for decoupling two half-reactions are desired. Herein, we show the feasibility of photocatalytic oxygen evolution in a powder system with BiVO4 as a photocatalyst and polyoxometalate H3PMo12O40 as an electron and proton acceptor. The resulting reaction mixture was allowed to be directly used for the subsequent hydrogen evolution with the reduced H3PMo12O40 as electron and proton donors. Our system exhibits excellent stability in repeated oxygen and hydrogen evolution, which brings considerable convenience to decoupled water splitting.									11	1	0	0	0	0	12			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000413354300007	28885769

The nature and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism of the IrO2 + MnO2 electrodes in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution was studied by EIS measurements, emphasizing on the influence of coating composition, preparation temperature and the reaction potential. A mathematical simulation of experimental EIS data was carried out based on one state-variable theory. The simulated numerical number deduced the IrO2(x) + MnO2(1-x) coating nature and oxygen evolution reaction mechanism during the process Of 02 evolution. The inner relationships of coating nature with coating composition, and preparation temperature, the reaction potential, were analyzed and founded by these parameters of the R-s, R-f, C-f, R-ct and C-d1.

Cobalt hydroxyl carbonate (CoHC) nanoneedle arrays are grown on Cu foam by a hydrothermal method. Using an electrochemical deposition method, Ce(OH)(3) is deposited on the surface of the CoHC nanoneedles, which is converted into CeO2 modified Co3O4 with the same morphology by simple calcination in air. Excellent catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction is observed, featured for the low overpotential of only 334 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. The enhanced OER performance is attributed to the variable Ce oxidation number and oxygen vacancy in CeO2. The results demonstrate the positive effect of CeO2 for the oxygen evolution reaction which was largely ignored in previous study. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Transition metal elements and heteroatomic doping are important methods used to enhance their catalytic performances. Lately, the construction of electrocatalysts based on metal-organic framework (MOF) electrospun nanofibers has become a research hotspot. In this work, nickel-cobalt zeolitic imidazolate frameworks with different molar ratios (NixCoy-ZIFs) were synthesized in an aqueous solution, followed by NixCoy-ZIFs/polyacrylonitrile (PAN) electrospun nanofiber precursors, which were prepared by a simple electrospinning method. Bimetal (Ni-Co) porous carbon nanofiber catalysts doped with nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur elements were obtained at high-temperature carbonization treatment in different atmospheres (argon (Ar), Air, and hydrogen sulfide (H2S)), respectively. The morphological properties, structures, and composition were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Moreover, the specific surface area of materials and their pore size distribution was characterized by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET). Linear sweep voltammetry curves investigated catalyst performances towards oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. Importantly, Ni1Co2-ZIFs/PAN-Ar yielded the best ORR activity, whereas Ni1Co1-ZIFs/PAN-Air exhibited the best OER performance. This work provides significant guidance for the preparation and characterization of multi-doped porous carbon nanofibers carbonized in different atmospheres.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2079-4991		WOS:000768074300001	35269320

Both X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy results confirm that F is doped into the pyrochlore crystal lattice, inducing the oxygen vacancies (VO). Importantly, the OER catalytic activity is positively correlated with VO concentration. The density functional calculation (DFT) reveals that the existence of VO enhances the metal-oxygen covalency of pyrochlore, which is conducive to the lattice oxygen evolution mechanism, hence greatly accelerating the OER kinetic. Consequently, the optimized YRuOF catalyst exhibits a greatly enhanced OER activity with an overpotential of -235 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in comparison with that on undoped pyrochlore (-296 mV). Furthermore, such a Fdoped YRuOF catalyst has a very good OER stability. This study provides an ideal perspective to develop highly efficient and durable YRuOF for the oxygen evolution reaction.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000659445900007

To date, however, electrocatalysts with long-term stability have remained elusive. Here we report that single-crystal Co3O4 nanocube underlay with a thin CoO layer results in a high-performance and high-stability electrocatalyst in oxygen evolution reaction. An in situ X-ray diffraction method is developed to observe a strong correlation between the initialization of the oxygen evolution and the formation of active metal oxyhydroxide phase. The lattice of skin layer adapts to the structure of the active phase, which enables a reversible facile structural change that facilitates the chemical reactions without breaking the scaffold of the electrocatalysts. The single-crystal nanocube electrode exhibits stable, continuous oxygen evolution for 41,000 h. This robust stability is attributed to the complementary nature of defect-free single-crystal electrocatalyst and the reversible adapting layer.									296	8	0	0	16	0	299			2041-1723			WOS:000360355200001	26315066

In this report, the NiS-Cu2S composites were prepared on copper foam (NiS-Cu2S-CF) using a facile synthetic strategy. The scanning electron microscopy results confirmed that the NiS nanoneedles were successfully grown on Cu2S nanoflakes, greatly increasing the active sites. Particularly, the optimized 15% NiS-Cu2S-CF composite demonstrated excellent oxygen evolution activity with a small overpotential of 308 mV@20 mA cm(-2), which is significantly smaller than that of noble metal-based electrocatalysts and other NiS-Cu2S-CF composites. The enhanced oxygen evolution activity is attributed to the unique morphology that can provide ample active sites, rich ion-transfer pathways, and the synergistic effect between NiS and Cu2S, which can boost the electron transfer rate.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2072-666X		WOS:000807731700001	35208402

We hypothesize that, by decreasing the local activity of H2O near the anode surface by substantially increasing the ionic strength of the electrolyte, the oxygen evolution reaction would be suppressed, leading concomitantly to a higher selectivity of Cl-2 over O-2 formation. Hence, the influence of the ionic strength on the competition between electrochemical evolution of O-2 and Cl-2 at dimensionally stable anodes (DSAs) was investigated. Addition of a high concentration of NaNO3, an inert electrolyte additive, increases the selectivity for chlorine at high current density, as determined by means of online electrochemical mass spectrometry and UV-vis spectroscopy. We propose conditions in which free water is suppressed, owing to under-coordination of the solvation shells of ions, as a general concept to modulate the selectivity of competing electrochemical reactions.									18	0	0	0	2	0	18			2196-0216			WOS:000475465600018

The authors present a new platform for electrocatalysts that functions in an unprecedented way to turn a catalyst into substrate. The NiFe alloy catalyzed substrate (NiFe-CS) described herein is substantially active and stable electrocatalyst for both HER and OER, with low overpotential of 33 and 191 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively. This structure enables not only the maximization of electrochemically active sites, but also the formation of hydroxyl species on the surface as the active phase. These outstanding results provide a new pathway for the development of electrocatalysts used in energy conversion technology.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000669029600001	34213823

The current potential profiles for the formation/reduction of surface oxides and the deposition/dissolution of hydrogen at a virgin RuZr electrode are basically similar to those at an elemental Ru electrode. The onset of the oxygen evolution reaction and Ru-corrosion reactions are well resolved on RuZr alloy; the Ru-corrosion reaction is shifted positively by about 1.12 V. This is attributed to the presence of more basic Zr-O-Ru bonds in the gelatinous oxyhydroxide film that is formed during the anodic polarization. The film thus formed exists permanently on the surface, and it plays a vital role in catalysing the electrochemical reaction by virtue of its ability to exhibit three redox couples. This film is capable of catalysing the hydrogen evolution reaction. RuZr does not catalyse the methanol-oxidation reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0256-1654			WOS:000073611200008

In this work, we take an effective and widely used catalyst, rutile RuO2, as a representative and studied its catalytic mechanism in lithium oxygen batteries via ab initio calculations. For the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), it is found that rutile RuO2 can provide large adsorption energies toward LiO2 and Li2O2, thus resulting in high initial discharge voltages. Moreover, the normalized degree of unsaturation of surface oxygen is identified as a descriptor for the ORR catalytic activity. For the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), we propose that, in addition to the three-phase interface, the OER may also occur at the two-phase interface of Li2O2/RuO2, where rutile RuO2 provides pathways for the lithium ions while oxygen evolves from the exposed surfaces of Li2O2. Calculation results show that our proposed catalytic scenario is both thermodynamically and kinetically viable. Along with the charge process, the remaining Li2O2 can be attracted to the catalytic surfaces spontaneously, which can effectively preserve the reaction interface.									44	3	0	0	0	0	44			2155-5435			WOS:000382714000074

Metal selenides have been reported as promising oxygen-evolution catalysts; however, their active forms are yet to be elucidated. Here we show that a representative selenide catalyst, nickel selenide, is entirely converted into nickel hydroxide under oxygen-evolution conditions. This result indicates that metal selenides are unstable during oxygen evolution, and the in situ generated metal oxides are responsible for their activity. This knowledge inspired us to synthesize nanostructured nickel iron diselenide, a hitherto unknown metal selenide, and to use it as a templating precursor to a highly active nickel iron oxide catalyst. This selenide-derived oxide catalyses oxygen evolution with an overpotential of only 195 mV for 10 mA cm(-2). Our work underscores the importance of identifying the active species of oxygen-evolution catalysts, and demonstrates how such knowledge can be applied to develop better catalysts.									651	28	0	0	32	0	658			2041-1723			WOS:000380952500001	27503136

In this work, uniform NixFe1-x-P nanosheets arrays are vertically grown on carbon cloth to form an effective oxygen evolution reaction catalyst. Such structure is prepared by phosphorization of the corresponding layered double hydroxide nanosheets. In this synthesis, the hydroxides are converted to phosphide while the porous nature is well retained. The ratio of Ni to Fe in the phosphide is tuned and the optimized synergistic effect between Ni and Fe for oxygen evolution reaction catalytic activity is achieved. The nanoarrays with hierarchical porous structure offer more reaction sites and promote the charge transfer. As a result, low reaction overpotential and small Tafel slope have been realized. In additional, the synthesis strategy can be also applied to prepare Ni5P4 hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst. A full water electrolyzer is demonstrated with the optimized cathode and anode, and remarkable overall water splitting activity is obtained with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the potential of 1.53 V.

The catalyst demonstrated excellent activity for the oxygen evolution reaction with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 0.291 V in alkaline media (1 M KOH), which is superior to the activities of commercial IrO2, RuO2, and Pt/C catalysts and comparable to those of state-of-the-art catalysts (e.g., NiFe-LDH, NiCo2O4, O-NiCoFe-LDH). Density functional theory simulations suggested that the incorporation of multiple metal elements can indeed improve the reaction energetics with a synergistic effect from the core-shell structure.

The aim of this work is to prepare low-cost MnO2 electrocatalyst with high activity for the ORR and OER via introduction of surface oxygen vacancies (OVs). Herein, the procedure of thermal heating treatment under air or H-2 has been demonstrated as an efficient way to create OVs on the surface of alpha -MnO2 and beta -MnO2 nanorods, which are found to be highly active for both ORR and OER. The existence of surface OVs can modulate the intrinsic activity of alpha -MnO2 and beta -MnO2 and improve their ORR and OER kinetics. More importantly, the H-2-treated MnO2 possesses much more surface OVs and thus exhibits much better catalytic performances for ORR and OER in comparison with MnO2 obtained by common annealing treatments under air. Especially, the H-2-treated alpha -MnO2 nanorods show the best activity for the ORR and OER. The results confirm that the heating treatment under H-2 reducing atmosphere can be a facile and efficient process to develop bifunctional Mn-based electrocatalysts for electrochemical oxygen reactions.									8	0	0	0	1	0	7			2699-9412			WOS:000783860800003

The encapsulated Fe dramatically enhances the catalytic activity, and the graphitic shells play a double role of efficiently mediating the electron transfer to O-2 and H2O reactants and providing a cocoon that prevents uncontrolled Fe oxidation or leaching.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000360312100030	26179742

The evolution efficiency reached over 90 %. The anode electrode was prepared by modification of a conventional dimensionally stable anode (DSA) through surface covering with manganese dioxide. The result of this modification was an unusual change in the behavior of chlorine-hydrogen oxygen-hydrogen cells under diluted chloride solution electrolysis. This system satisfies the kinetic conditions of the chlorine evolution reaction (CER). The efficiency and physical properties of the electrode were characterized using cyclic voltarnmetry and partial polarization curves. The surface structure and morphology of the electrode were characterized using SEM and STM. In the absence of chlorine adsorption, the electrode surface containing MnO2 particles had an even distribution of MnO2 particles on the surface and particularities of its morphology. This morphology resulted in the low selectivity of this electrode for the chlorine evolution reaction.									7	0	0	0	0	0	8			1226-086X			WOS:000248517600009

In the present study, we have designed a new process for conversion of metallic waste to iron nanosheets and utilized this material to generate oxygen, an important component of environment for sustainable life. This transformation of waste tin-plated steel to iron nanosheet (20-25nm thick) will provide a solution to environmental pollution as well as a robust electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction. Here, a single-step hydrometallurgy approach has been utilized for the transformation of waste tin-plated steel containers to iron nanosheet, and its efficiency toward the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline condition was investigated. The results show that the nanostructured iron sheet exhibits better properties as a electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction in terms of the onset overpotential of O-2 evolution (similar to 329mV) in comparison with the bulk iron (similar to 500mV) as well as iron-based alloy (Fe33Co67,similar to 400mV). Thus, in the present investigation, the transformation of an efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction, which is a value-added product from waste scrap, has been achieved at low cost. The above process is quite economical and can be easily extended for large-scale productions of the robust electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1735-1472	1735-2630		WOS:000470777200073

We consider three possible reaction pathways for O-2 evolution. Our calculations show that O-2 evolution from the OH*-OH* species has high energy barrier and from OOH* species have a little high energy barrier. Finally, we discover that O-2 can easily release from OO* species.The mechanism of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) over NiFe-layered double hydroxides was investigated using DFT + U method by First-principle. The present work considered two possible reaction pathways for O-2 evolution. Our calculation suggested that O-2 evolution from the OOH* species may be more favorable because of advantages in energy profile, oxygen adsorption, and overall energy barrier. In addition, density of states (DOS) and partial density of states (PDOSs) of NiFe-LDH and Ni(OH)(2) showed that NiFe-LDH had a more stronger capability for electron transportation and higher activity than Ni(OH)(2). Additionally, it was found that Bader charge of Ni had a large fluctuation in the former elementary steps, while in the later that of Fe had. The research suggested that the transitional metal Fe/Ni-based hydrotalcite was a suitable material for OER, for not only they had great activity and stability, but also they were widely used and comparatively cheap.[GRAPHICS].									47	6	0	0	2	0	49			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000358322000002

Although atomic M-N-C materials have been extensively studied in heterogeneous catalysis field, the insufficient antioxidant capacity of carbonous substrates hinders their practical application in OER. Developing highly active and stable OER electrocatalysts is the key for electrochemical water splitting. This review presents feasible design strategies for fabricating carbon-free single-site catalysts and their applications in HER/OER and overall water splitting. The constitutive relationships between structure, composition, and catalytic performance for HER and OER are detailly discussed, providing ponderable insights into rationally constructing high-performance HER and OER electrocatalysts.

Efficient electrocatalysts for these reactions are highly desired to lower their overpotentials and promote practical applications of related energy devices. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently emerged as precursors to fabricate carbon-based electrocatalysts with high electrical conductivity and uniformly distributed active sites. In this review, the current progress of MOF-derived carbon-based materials for ORR/OER/HER electrocatalysis is presented. Materials design strategies of MOF-derived carbon-based materials are firstly summarized to show the rich possibilities of the morphology and composition of MOF-derived carbon-based materials. A wide range of applications based on these materials for ORR, OER, HER and multifunctional electrocatalysis are discussed, with an emphasis on the required features of MOF-derived carbon-based materials for the electrocatalysis of corresponding reactions. Finally, perspectives on the development of MOF-derived carbon-based materials for ORR, OER and HER electrocatalysis are provided.									674	43	0	0	42	0	675			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000519913000009	32039429

Herein, we report a simple and robust electrochemical activation strategy that can generate abundant oxygen vacancies in nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOxHy) by reducing the intrinsic surface high-valence Ni3+ in a short time, endowing NiOxHy with an enhanced surface water adsorption, fast charge transfer kinetics, and in particular a distinct pH-dependent OER activity. The electrochemically activated NiOxHy exhibits an overpotential of 327 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1), which outperforms the pristine NiOxHy. This work therefore provides a viable route to regulating the local defects and electronic structure at the electrocatalyst surface to engineer high-performance TM based electrocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000728123600002

A relatively small change (10 at.%) in the alloy composition brought a notable difference in the alloys' performance for the ORR. Pt40Dy60 electrode, i.e., the electrode with a lower amount of Pt, was identified to have a higher activity towards ORR as evidenced by lower overpotential and higher current densities under identical experimental conditions. Furthermore, DFT calculations point out the unique single-atom-like coordination and electronic structure of Pt atoms in the Pt40Dy60 surface as responsible for enhanced ORR activity compared to the alloy with a higher Pt content. Additionally, Pt-Dy alloys showed activity in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with the OER current density lower than that of pure Pt.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-4991		WOS:000833226600001	35889543

Herein, we report a highly active trifunctional electrocatalyst for hydrogen and oxygen electrodes comprising Co/CoOx nanoparticles embedded onto nitrogen-doped carbon-graphene obtained by the pyrolysis of graphene oxide supported cobalt metal-organic framework (ZIF-67) under a nitrogen atmosphere. The as-prepared Co@NC-G-700 catalyst shows robust and highly active HER in both acid and base electrolyte with low overpotential (140 and 136 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively). In addition, this catalyst exhibits excellent ORR performance, including a positive half-wave potential (similar to 0.83 V vs RHE), a low Tafel slope of 47.9 mV dec(-1), outstanding stability, and strong tolerance to CH3OH crossover. Furthermore, Co@NC-G-700 displays a good oxygen evolution reaction activity in alkaline media with an overpotential of only 322 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The surface Co-N-x sites should be responsible for the efficient HER and ORR, while Co-O-Co, Co-N-C, and Co-O-C sites might work together in OER. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Achieving this goal requires elucidation of fundamental relationships between surface structure and reaction mechanism. Here we address this issue using ab initio computations to determine the surface structure and OER mechanism for LaNiO3, a perovksite oxide that exhibits high activity but low stability. We find a new OER mechanism in which lattice oxygen participation via reversible formation of surface oxygen vacancies is critical. We show that this mechanism has a lower reaction barrier compared to the generally proposed mechanism, leading to improved agreement with experimental data. Extending the study to La1-xSrxBO3 (B = transition metal), we demonstrate a transition to the lattice oxygen mediated mechanism with decreasing catalyst stability. Our results suggest new approaches for next-generation catalysts design.									260	7	0	0	22	1	261			2155-5435			WOS:000369774900076

A combination of chronoamperometry (CA) and online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OLEMS) experiments provides insight into the selectivity issue: At pH = 0.9, the CER dominates over oxygen evolution, whereas at pH = 3.5, oxygen evolution and other parasitic side reactions contribute mostly to the total current density. From temperature dependent CA data for pH = 0.9, we determine the apparent free activation energy of the CER over RuO2(110) to be 0.91 eV, which compares reasonably well with the theoretical value of 0.79 eV derived from first-principles microkinetics. The experimentally determined apparent free activation energy of 0.91 eV is considered as a benchmark for assessing future improved theoretical modeling from first principles.									68	2	0	0	4	0	69			2155-5435			WOS:000398986700019

To overcome this problem, construction of gas diffusion electrodes providing plenty amount of reaction fields for oxygen reduction and evolution are necessary. In this work, we investigate the reaction fields in the gas diffusion electrodes by comparing the oxygen diffusion resistances in the gas diffusion electrodes with different electrolyte solutions and catalyst layer thicknesses to improve the overpotential of the gas diffusion electrode. It is suggested that the reaction fields for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution concentrate on the air side and the electrolyte sides of the catalyst layer, respectively. Based on this assignment, we fabricate a gas diffusion electrode where the oxygen reduction and evolution catalysts are, respectively arranged to the air and electrolyte sides of the catalyst layer. This electrode showed both lower overpotential and higher cyclability than those loaded the same catalysts with the opposed and mixed configuration.

Herein, a three-dimensional hierarchically porous carbon framework embedded with cobalt-iron-phosphide nanodots nanocomposite is fabricated via a lyophilization-pyrolysis-phosphorization process. The synthetic catalyst displays excellent performances towards both the oxygen reduction reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction. With our optimal sample, the half-wave potential for the oxygen reduction reaction is up to 0.83 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, and its potential for the oxygen evolution reaction at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is as low as 1.53 V in 0.1 M KOH solution. The catalyst also exhibits improved electrochemical performances in a rechargeable lithium-oxygen battery, including a high specific capacity (11969 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1)) and a long cycle life (141 cycles at a cut-off capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1)). All of these results make our catalyst a promising candidate for the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts for the rechargeable lithium-oxygen batteries.									18	2	0	0	2	0	18			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000456762100050

While ab initio theory in the density functional theory approximation initially focused on the mechanistic description via the OH, O, and OOH adsorbates, in recent years the lattice oxygen evolution reaction (LOER) mechanism attracted increasing attention, given that the LOER is seen as the main reason for catalyst instability under anodic potential conditions. The present concept article critically analyzes the LOER and indicates pitfalls in the interpretation of this mechanistic pathway. A method to assess the energetics of the LOER in relation to conventional OER mechanisms by the compilation of free-energy diagrams is introduced, which may contribute to enhance our understanding of the competing LOER and OER on the atomic scale. Further works are urgently needed to comprehend the interrelationship for the evolution of gaseous oxygen from the electrolyte or the crystal lattice.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000686113700001

Herein, a Co3V2O8/MoS2/ carbon cloth (Co3V2O8/MoS2/CC) composite was prepared by two-step hydrothermal growth of Co3V2O8/MoS2 on carbon cloth. This nanocomposite exhibited highly efficient electrocatalytic properties in both hydrogen evolution reactions and oxygen evolution reactions. When the current density reached 10 mA cm(-2), it merely required the overpotentials of 98 mV and 259 mV, respectively. Moreover, at a two-electrode system, we measured the performance of Co3V2O8/MoS2/CC acted as both anode and cathode, and the current density could achieve 10 mA cm(-2) with the voltage of only 1.62 V.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2365-6549			WOS:000596036800007

In this work, we report a convenient and effective strategy to synthesis Co metal and MnO immobilized on carbon nanotubes (MnO/Co-CNTs) vis strong metal-support interaction (SMSI). The CNTs support anchored abundant MnO/Co nanoparticles (NPs) in a small size of similar to 2 nm, when the strong interaction between them suppressed the homogeneous nucleation of MnO/Co during high temperature sintering. Thus, enormous well-dispersed catalytic active sites are produced on the conductive CNTs. Together with the boosted charge transfer between MnO/Co and support, the catalytic activity of MnO/Co-CNTs is eventually significantly promoted. The catalyst shows an efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution. Furthermore, SMSI alleviate the agglomeration of NPs and secure the active sites during electrochemical reactions, which account for the enhanced catalytic durability for ORR, OER and HER. In consequence, the MnO/Co-CNTs catalyst shows excellent performance for rechargeable Zn-air battery, and can be utilized to catalyze overall water splitting to produce hydrogen and oxygen. This work manifests a promising approach for optimizing the catalytic performance of the NPs. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			0925-8388	1873-4669		WOS:000653091500004

In this work, Fe-doped NiTe2 nanoflakes have been synthesized via facile one-step solvothermal approach. The hierarchical Ni0.4Fe0.6Te2 nanoflakes grwon on Nickel foam (NF) demonstrate the high electrochemical activity and stability towards Oxygen evolution reaction in 1 M KOH solution. The optimized Ni0.4Fe0.6Te2/NF needs only 190 mV overpotential to produce 10mAcm(-2) and can afford the higher current densities for the OER of 400mAcm(-2) and 500mAcm(-2 )at overpotential of 300 mV and 330 mV, respectively. The small R ct value for the Ni0.4Fe0.6Te2/NF suggests the reduced polarization resistance and electrode-electrolyte resistance. Moreover, it showed the extraordinary stability of 30 hours in controlled electrolysis experiment with no significant change in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The synergistic effect of bimetal atoms are considered mainly responsible for the high catalytic activity and stability, providing assistance in inducing the lattice distortion into the crystal structure of NiTe2 that activates the evolution of surface partial oxygen atoms, enabling lattice oxygen mechanism. Even after prolong activity of OER; formation of dynamic NiFeOOH(Te)/NF species sustains excellent OER activity. This work provides facile synthetic approach to develop highly applied low cost and binder free electrocatalyst. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

It is able to do so given that molecular oxygen forms a complex with the lithium phthalocyanine anion thereby keeping oxygen and the reaction intermediates in solution. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show the mechanism for complex formation and cyclic voltammetry results support the notion of reaction intermediates that are soluble in solution during oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. Deep discharge of a lithium-oxygen cell with TBA-LiPc had a capacity that was 3.6 times greater (5.28 mAh) than a similar cell with no TBA-LiPc (1.47 mAh). Long-term cycling of a lithium-oxygen cell with TBA-LiPc at a fixed capacity of 0.55 mAh did not fail after 100 cycles. A similar cell without TBA-LiPc failed after 37 cycles.

However, implementation of both hydrogen and oxygen electrodes is hindered by low activity and poor stability of electrocatalysts for both water splitting and oxygen reduction. Herein, we report a high-temperature annealing strategy to fabricate a highly dispersed ruthenium-based catalyst embedded onto nitrogen-doped graphene (0.4-Ru@NG-750). The 0.4-Ru@NG-750 catalyst exhibits high trifunctional electrocatalytic activity and good stability in HER, ORR, and OER. The 0.4-Ru@NG-750 electrocatalyst exhibits a low overpotential of only 0.04 and 0.09 V at the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) for HER in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively, and 0.372 V for OER in 1.0 M KOH. Moreover, it shows a high half-wave potential of 0.826 and 0.723 V for ORR in 0.1 M KOH and 0.1 M HClO4, respectively. Structural characterizations show that RuN4Cx is one of the main structures in 0.4-Ru@NG-750. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the surface states of RuN4Cx sites evolve in different reaction conditions. In HER, ORR, and OER, the most stable states should be RuN4Cx, RuN4(OH)C-x, and RuN4(O)C-x, respectively, on which the theoretical overpotential is the lowest.									82	2	0	0	1	0	81			2155-5435			WOS:000494549700021

Herein, we report a facile method to prepare Ru-based aerogels for HER, OER, and water electrolysis. Specifically, Ru aerogel exhibits comparable HER performance with Pt/C, evidenced by a close overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2), a smaller Tafel slope, and an outperformed long-term stability. Among a series of RuCo aerogels, the Ru0.7Co0.3 aerogel has the best OER performance superior to the RuO2 benchmark catalyst, with a very small overpotential of 272 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope value of 41.6 mV dec(-1), and the improved long-term durability. The excellent OER performance of the Ru0.7Co0.3 aerogel is mainly attributed to the RuCo synergistic catalytic effect, the abundant oxygen vacancies, and the structural merits of the sample. Notably, in the practical overall water splitting test, the combined Ru and Ru0.7Co0.3 aerogel catalyst outperformsthe Pt/C + RuO2 couple. This study can shed light on preparation of metal aerogel-based bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting and beyond.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000707635300004

The enhanced HER and OER performances observed as a result of the nitrogen doping of MoS2 is attributed to N-MoS2 being characterized by a higher electrochemical active surface area (9.1 × 10-4 cm2) and lower charge transfer resistance (8.1 Ω) than its precursor.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0374-4914			KJD:ART002834870

Sample Ni1Co4S@C-1000 is one of the most efficient electrocatalysts and exhibited superior activity and stability in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to the Ni substitution, the high porosity, the homogeneous dispersion of active components and the effect of N, S-codoping. This novel material showed a low onset potential of 1.43 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) and a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.51 V in a 0.1 M KOH alkaline solution over a long-term operation, which is better than IrO2/C and other composites synthesized under the same conditions. The Ni1Co4S@C-1000 sample can also efficiently catalyse oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), with a four-electron pathway for reversible oxygen evolution and reduction. Furthermore, Ni1Co4S@C-800 showed enhanced electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in water splitting.

Herein, a series of metal-free graphdiyne doped with heteroatoms was designed for promoting these key chemical reactions. To evaluate electrocatalytic performance, the reaction pathways and free energies were investigated systematically with the density functional theory (DFT). The calculations indicated that the dopants can optimize the adsorption of intermediates, lowering the overpotential of the reactions. Particularly, an intrinsic descriptor was identified to correlate the catalytic properties with catalyst structures, from which rapid screening could be made for the development of new catalysts. The results may provide guidance for the construction of carbon-based catalysts in clean energy technologies (such as fuel cells, metal-air batteries, electrolyzing water and so on).									1	1	0	0	0	0	1			0251-0790			WOS:000616102800021

Thus, oxygen evolution catalysts are required to improve the reaction kinetics. Precious metal catalysts are highly active, but the raw materials are scarce and costly. Thus, catalysts based on earth-abundant elements have drawn attention, and high performance, low-cost, and practial catalysts have been reported. Of the precious-metal-free commercial electrocatalysts, cobalt oxides are among the most important, and their catalytic properties can be improved by incorporating other elements. In this paper, we report that electrodeposited cobalt stannide (CoSn2) is a highly efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalyst, showing long-term electrochemical stability under alkaline conditions. Under optimal conditions, the catalyst operates at overpotentials of 250 and 300 mV at current densities of 1 and 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, and has a Tafel slope of 64 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, the prepared CoSn2 shows good electrochemical stability, and the overpotential for catalytic current densities of 1 and 10 mA cm(-2) remained stable during electrolysis for 110 h. The results indicate that the as-prepared CoSn2 shows oxygen evolution reaction activity comparable to P- and Se-containing cobalt-based benchmark catalysts and suggest that electrodeposited CoSn2 is an attractive noble-metal-free catalyst for water oxidation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000695706600001

The Tafel slopes and reaction orders evaluated in this paper are consistent with the B. O'Grady's Path for oxygen evolution on oxides. The activation energy for OER in La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 was 28.3 kJ mol(-1). The obtained apparent porosity of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 electrode is 48% and the roughness factor is around 1.6 x 10(4). The polarization resistance of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 is much low compared with other similar oxides. This can be due the high roughness and high porosity in addition to the low active energy for the process. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Oxygen vacancy engineering is an effective method to tune the OER performance, but the direct relationship between the concentration of oxygen vacancy and OER activity is not well understood. Herein, a series of NiyCe100-yOx with different concentration of oxygen vacancies were successfully synthesized. The larger concentration of oxygen vacancies in Ni75Ce25Ox and Ni50Ce50Ox result in their lower Tafel slopes, small mass-transfer resistance, and larger electrochemical surface areas of the catalysts, which account for the higher OER activities for these two catalysts. Moreover, with a fixed current density of 10 mA/cm(2), the potential remains stable at 1.57 V for more than 100 h, indicating the long-term stability of the Ni75Ce25Ox catalyst.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6				2079-4991		WOS:000622874100001	33572183

The recent development of a high-salt-concentration strategy for aqueous electrolytes, which significantly expands their electrochemical potential window, has created attractive opportunities to explore high-performance electrode materials for aqueous lithium-ion batteries. This study evaluates the compatibility of large-capacity oxygen-redox cathodes with hydrate-melt electrolytes. Using conventional oxygen-redox cathode materials (Li2RuO3, Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2, and Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2), it is determined that avoiding the use of transition metals with high catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction is the key to ensuring the stable progress of the oxygen redox reaction in concentrated aqueous electrolytes.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2198-3844		WOS:000757796600001	35182049

Subsequently, ii) solvent removal by vacuum filtration and drying, and iii) pyrolysis of the resulting composites under an inert gas atmosphere with subsequent mild calcination yielded manganese oxides embedded within a graphitic carbon matrix (MnOX/G). We further demonstrate that traces of Fe impurities in the used graphite result in enhanced electrocatalytic activity of the MnOX/G towards both the oxygen reduction and the oxygen evolution reactions, owing to synergistic interaction of the iron impurities with the species formed upon thermal decomposition of Mn macrocyclic complexes.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2196-0216			WOS:000419105200015

Here, we introduce a superaerophobic nitrogen-doped tungsten carbide nanoarray electrode exhibiting high stability and activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction as well as driving oxygen evolution efficiently in acid. Nitrogen-doping and nanoarray structure accelerate hydrogen gas release from the electrode, realizing a current density of - 200 mA cm(-2) at the potential of - 190 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, which manifest one of the best non-noble metal catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction.

In this regard, the splitting of water activated by sunlight is a sustainable and carbon-free new energy conversion scheme able to produce efficient technological devices. The availability of appropriate catalysts is essential for the proper kinetics of the two key processes involved, namely, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). During the last decade, ruthenium nanoparticle derivatives have emerged as true potential substitutes for the state-of-the-art platinum and iridium oxide species for the HER and OER, respectively. Thus, after a summary of the most common methods for catalyst benchmarking, this review covers the most significant developments of ruthenium-based nanoparticles used as catalysts for the water-splitting process. Furthermore, the key factors that govern the catalytic performance of these nanocatalysts are discussed in view of future research directions.									56	1	0	0	2	0	56			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000478761200002	30957439

The results indicate that a high concentration of Mn2+ (e.g. 3.0 gL(-1)) in the electrolyte resulted in the formation of a MnO2 layer on the surface of the anode. This layer decreased the oxygen evolution activity of the anode, but at the same time made the underlying PbO2 layer more compact and flat, effectively improving the anodic corrosion resistance. When the Mn2+ concentration was low (e.g. 0.1 g L-1), no MnO2 layer was formed but the structure of the PbO2 anodic layer was modified. As a result, the oxygen evolution activity and corrosion resistance were both significantly improved. In addition, Mn2+ in the electrolyte did not change the kinetic mechanism of oxygen evolution reaction. The reaction was exclusively controlled by the formation and adsorption of first intermediate, and the adsorption resistance played a dominant part in the whole reaction resistance.

To resolve this issue, great efforts have been made in focusing the three-dimensional (3D) electrodes, which can provide adequate hierarchical channels and ensure the gas penetration of the air electrodes. Therefore, it is necessary to give a timely updates of 3D electrodes. In this review, we present the fundamentals and recent progress of 3D electrodes in oxygen reduction/evolution reactions, mainly including the 3D electrode design, the electrocatalysis in oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution and the bi-functional activity of the two reactions. Besides, metal-air batteries facilitated with 3D electrodes are also fully discussed, including the mechanisms based on the aqueous and organic electrolytes. At the end, the existing challenges and perspectives of 3D electrodes are proposed for further development of the metal-air batteries and auxiliary generative ideas for the renewable energy development.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000747395000031

According to this process the working potential is fixed by the nature of electrode material and is buffered during organics oxidation by the side reaction of OER.

Annealing condition plays an important role towards catalytic performance due to morphological control and surface composition. Although, there is no significant change in onset potentials but these catalysts afford a current density >10 mA cm(-2) at the potential of 1.65 V for oxygen evolution reaction and a current density >2.5 mA cm(-2) at the potential of 0.009 V for oxygen reduction reaction with respect to RHE in 0.1 M KOH. The underlying mechanism for ORR and OER as well as catalytic activity differences were understood with the help of different analytical characterization techniques.

Here, a facile strategy to synthesize novel Co-MOF,O-doped carbon (Co-MOF-T) based on Zn, Co-doped glucosamine and ZIF-8 by pyrolysis at temperature T was demonstrated. The prepared Co-MOF-800 showed a superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity comparable to that of commercial Pt/C catalyst. In addition, this catalyst shows great potential in the overall water splitting due to the excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reac-tion (HER) activities. Based on the trifunctional activity, the primary Zn-air batteries using a Co-MOF-800 air electrode achieved a high open-circuit voltage of 1.38 V, a specific capacity of 671.6 mAh g(Zn)(-1), and a prominent peak power density of 144 mW cm(-2). Also, the rechargeable Zn-air batteries based on Co-MOF-800 air electrode could be smoothly run for 510 cycles with a low voltage gap of 0.58 V. Finally, the trifunctional Co-MOF-800 catalyst was applied to boost the electrochemical water splitting, demon-strating its promising potential as a green energy material for practical applications.

Measurements using a combination of electrochemical flow cell, atomic absorption spectroscopy, and rotating ring disk electrode reveal a high sensitivity of oxygen evolution and of manganese oxide corrosion toward the presence of ions (alkali-metal cations and anions) in the electrolyte. The charge to radius ratio of alkali-metal ions affected the reactivity of the oxides and was seen to influence the reaction under both potentiostatic and potentiodynamic conditions, with Li+ and (K+,Cs+)-containing electrolytes showing the lowest and highest activities, respectively. Thermogravimetry in combination with mass spectrometry showed significant differences between samples treated in different electrolytes. Raman spectroscopy showed that the material transformed during the oxygen evolution reaction, with multiple phases alpha-MnO2 and birnessite-MnO2 being present in the catalyst during oxygen evolution reaction. Electronic structure (XANES) studies revealed the significant influence of alkali-metal ions on the oxidation state of Mn, with the OER-inactive Mn2+ oxidation state being stabilized with the Li+ ion. It was found that selected combinations of anions and cations in the electrolyte and suitable potential can significantly stabilize the electrode during OER application.									44	0	0	0	1	0	44			2155-5435			WOS:000366153300026

To achieve this goal, understanding what aspects of the electrode structure dictate activity and catalyst dissolution is key. Here, we investigate these aspects by studying trends in the activity, stability, and operando structure of iridium oxides during the oxygen evolution reaction. Using operando X-ray photoelectron and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we determined the near-surface structure of oxides ranging from amorphous to crystalline during the reaction. We show that applying oxygen evolution potentials universally yields deprotonated mu(2)-O moieties and a mu(1)-O/mu(1)-OH mixture, with universal deprotonation energetics but in different amounts. This quantitative difference mainly results from variations in deprotonation depth: surface deprotonation for crystalline IrO2 versus near-surface deprotonation for semicrystalline and amorphous IrOx. We argue that both surface deprotonation and subsurface deprotonation modify the barrier for the oxygen evolution and Ir dissolution reactions, thus playing an important role in catalyst performance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000813220800001

Herein, we show that lead ruthenate pyrochlore (Pb2Ru2O7-x) electrocatalyst displays higher OER (oxygen evolution reaction) activity and selectivity over parasitic ACSFR (active chlorine species formation reaction) in comparison to other reported electrocatalysts during simulated seawater electrolysis. The higher OER selectivity and activity of Pb2Ru2O7-x as compared to benchmark RuO2 is ascribed to the presence of a greater concentration of surface Ru(V) and oxygen vacancies. Simulated seawater electrolysis using Pb(2)Ru(2)O(7-x )yields higher OER activity (60-fold) and selectivity at pH = 13 (similar to 99%) than at pH = 7 (similar to 68%) due to the unfavorable thermodynamics and kinetics of ACSFR at high pH. A current density of 275 mA/cm(2) is obtained at a cell voltage of 1.80 V at pH = 13 in an electrolyzer, with 10 mV voltage loss at 200 mA/cm(2) over 5 h of operation.									41	2	0	0	4	0	42			2574-0962			WOS:000529190300095

In this paper, SrTiO3 (STO) was prepared and doped with an extremely low concentration of NiP. By adjusting the doping process, the content of three kinds of oxygen species can be transformed accordingly, which consequently influences the catalytic activity in water splitting under visible light irradiation. The transformation of oxygen species and the improvement mechanism of hydrogen generation were investigated. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculation confirmed that Ni occupied the Ti sites and P coordinated with lattice oxygen on the STO surface. Structural evolution not only forms reactive lattice oxygen but also regulates oxygen vacancies and adsorbed oxygen. Reactive lattice oxygen serves as the reaction site during the hydrogen evolution reaction. In summary, constructing reactive lattice oxygen and adjusting the ratio of different oxygen species are effective ways to fabricate high-performance photocatalysts for H-2 evolution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000831552400001

The electrocatalysts were synthesised by adapting the Adams fusion method. The physical properties of the electrocatalysts were characterised by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction. Electrochemical activity of the electrocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. X-ray diffraction revealed no phase separation when RuO2 or SnO2 was introduced into the IrO2 lattice suggesting that solid solutions were formed. Transmission electron microscope analysis revealed nanosize particles for all synthesised metal oxides. Crystallinity increased with the addition of RuO2 and SnO2 while a suppression of crystal growth was observed with the addition of Ta2O5 to IrO2. Chronoamperometry revealed that the addition of all the secondary metal oxides to IrO2 resulted in improved catalytic performance. Ir0.7Ru0.3O2 was identified as the most promising electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction.									24	1	0	0	1	0	24			1452-3981			WOS:000312936700033

The combination of high surface area, enhanced mass and charge transport as well as three-dimensional conducting pathway enables superior oxygen evolution reaction. Notably, the NiCo2O4 core-shell nanowire electrode exhibits large anodic current and low onset overpotential for OER with an overpotential of similar to 320 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). Furthermore, the NiCo2O4 core-shell nanowire electrode possesses excellent electrocatalytic stability with long hour electrolysis showing no visible degradation, which is highly desirable for a promising OER electrocatalyst.

The prepared D-NSOCs electrocatalyst exhibits excellent ORR and OER bifunctional catalytic reactivity with a small potential gap (Delta E) of 0.77 V between the corresponding potential when the OER current density reaches 10 mA cm(-2) (E-j (= 10)) and the half-wave potential (E-1/2), which is slightly better than 0.78 V for the commercial Pt/C + IrO2. This deflagration method is generally applicable to other carbon materials. It can dope nitrogen and sulfur elements into carbon materials and realize the functionalization of oxygen on the surface of carbon materials. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, we obtained Co-Fe-O composites/reduced graphene oxides (CFO/rGO) hybrid structures, engineered their compositions, phase, and structures by a facile hydrothermal route, and studied their composition-dependent activity for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. It is found that synergetic effects bring a clear decrease in overpotential and Tafel slope for CFO/rGO catalysts in comparison with monometallic composition/rGO catalysts. OER charge-transfer resistance is significantly reduced after Fe addition, indicating that the reaction barriers of CFO/rGO are reduced. The optimal CFO/rGO with Co-Fe ratio of 2:1 was identified. Our results on the synergetic effects of CFO/rGO enrich the understanding of iron-group composites for electrocatalytic applications.									61	4	0	0	1	0	62			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000349954400013	25572639

However, the role of the substrate used for self-standing nanowires in oxygen evolution reaction is not fully investigated. Herein, we report that the oxygen evolution reaction activity is closely associated with the substrate. The oxygen evolution reaction activity of cobalt oxide catalysts is enhanced with the increasing electronegativity of the substrates, while iron oxide catalysts break this rule due to the stronger synergistic interplay between iron and copper compared to that between iron and gold. Under the guidance of these findings, we construct a highly active and robust non-precious-metal CuO@CoFeOx self-standing nanowire electrocatalyst, which shows a constant current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 0.36 V for 300 h continuously without noticeable degradation in 0.1 M KOH solution. Moreover, the CuO@CoFeOx nanowire anode coupled with a Pt-Ni foam cathode shows an attractive overpotential of 0.39 V to provide a current density of 10mAcm(-2) for water electrolysis in 1.0 M KOH solution.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000440876700049

The electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activity of the FeOOH-Ni(OH)_2 composite is significantly improved compared with FeOOH and Ni(OH)_2. The FeOOH-Ni(OH)_2 electrodes require an overpotential as low as 270 mV and the tafel slope to deliver 10 mA·cm~(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 mol/L KOH. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy further reveals the favorable kinetic during electrolysis. Moreover, The FeOOH-Ni(OH)_2 composite has excellent stability in the alkaline medium, and its overpotential remains stable during the 24 h test at high current density(50 mA·cm~(-2)). The strong electron interaction and synergistic reaction between FeOOH and Ni(OH)_2 are enhanced effectively. The conductivity promotes the charge transfer, and the core-shell structure effectively enhances the electrocatalytic activity area, and further enhances its oxygen evolution properties.			以碳纤维布(CFC)为基底,通过两步法(恒电流电沉积法、溶剂热法)成功制备了FeOOH-Ni(OH)_2复合材料。与FeOOH和Ni(OH)_2相比,该FeOOH-Ni(OH)_2复合材料作为电催化剂时,电催化析氧反应(OER)活性显著提高。在1 mol/L KOH电解质溶液中,达到10 mA·cm~(-2)电流密度时所需要的过电位仅为270 mV,Tafel斜率为78 mV/dec,电化学阻抗谱进一步揭示了电解过程中良好的动力学特性。FeOOHNi(OH)2复合材料在碱性介质中具有优异的稳定性,其在高电流密度下(50 mA·cm~(-2))的过电势经过连续24 h的测试之后几乎没有发生明显变化。FeOOH和Ni(OH)_2之间的强电子相互作用和协同效应有效提高了电导性,促进了电荷转移;此外,这种核壳结构有效增强了电催化活性面积,进而增强了其电催化析氧性能。						0	2	0	0	0	0	2			1000-3851			CSCD:6787960

In this study, we synthesized hematite nanoparticle film electrodes and applied them to spectro-electrochemical measurements to detect the intermediate species in oxygen evolution reaction. In situ UVvis absorption spectra showed that the formation of the species exhibiting absorption at 580 nm was the rate-determining step of oxygen evolution reaction on hematite over a wide range of pH from 4 to 13. In addition, the pH dependences of the onset potentials for oxygen evolution and formation of the intermediate species revealed that there were two reaction mechanisms, which switched at approximately pH 10. On the basis of careful inspection of the observed spectra and the possible active species with reference to previous reports on anomalously oxidized iron compounds, the detected intermediate species was assigned to iron in the oxidation state of 4+.									39	0	0	0	3	0	39			1932-7447			WOS:000387198400036		
C	Chen, Guobao; Yang, Hongying; Zhang, Huamin; Zhong, Hexiang			IEEE					MnxIr1-xO2/C Used As Bifunctional Electrocatalyst In Alkaline Medium								2013 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MATERIALS FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT (ICMREE), VOLS 1-3								440	444						2013	2013	There is a growing interest in oxygen electrochemistry as conversions between O-2 and H2O play an important role in a variety of renewable energy technologies. In this paper, bifunctional electrocatalysts of the general formula MnxIr1-xO2/C were prepared using a pyrolysis method. Their physical characteristics were examined via transmission electron microscopy, and the electrochemical properties were examined via cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry measurements in 1M KOH solution. Experimental results show that with the content of iridium increasing in MnxIr1-xO2/C, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity first increases and then decreases. Mn0.75Ir0.25O2/C has the highest ORR activity and its half-wave potential obtains -0.071V (relative to Hg/HgO electrode). It is worth noting that doping the MnO2/C nanoparticles with only a small amount of iridium can considerably improve the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of MnO2 in the alkaline medium. The oxygen evolution current density at 0.75 V vs. Hg/HgO of Mn0.75Ir0.25O2/C was nearly 4.31 times as that of MnO2/C. The results offer an important direction for the development of bifunctional oxygen catalysts in alkaline medium.

The oxygen evolution electrocatalytic performance of an amorphous Co-B alloy and its derivatives were studied. These materials were chemically synthesized by reducing a Co salt with NaBH4. The amorphous Co-B alloy showed good electrocatalytic activity in oxygen evolution but its stability was poor. A hydrotalcite-wrapped Co-B alloy was synthesized by mild oxidation. The electrocatalytic activity of this material in the oxygen evolution reaction was better than that of a commercially available Ir/C catalyst.

However, integrating oxygen vacancies into an amorphous catalyst with a large specific surface area, and investigating its effect on the oxygen evolution reaction remains a great challenge. Herein, oxygen vacancies are introduced into an amorphous N, P, and F tri-doped CoFe2O4 using ionic liquid as a dopant. Simultaneously, ultrafine MoS2 nanoclusters are anchored onto its surface to increase the specific surface area. The vacancy-rich MoS2/NPF-CoFe2O4 exhibits an overpotential of 250 mV and a small Tafel slope of 41 mV dec(-1), which is the best spinel-based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts so far. The excellent performance is attributed to massive oxygen vacancies, amorphous structure, large surface area, and synergistic coupling effects among active species. Density-functional theory calculations reveal that the electronic structure of the catalyst can be modulated in the presence of heteroatoms and MoS2 nanoclusters, and then the energy barriers of intermediates are decreased as well, which enhances the OER performance. This design not only provides a simple strategy to construct amorphous structures with abundant oxygen vacancies using ionic liquid-dopants, but also presents an in-depth insight into the OER mechanism in alkaline solution.									157	8	0	0	7	0	158			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000445444600005

However, the low conductivity and large size of CeO2 limit its application in electrocatalytic reactions. In this work, CeO2 nanodots are uniformly grown in situ on the surface of carbon spheres by a simple hydrothermal method. The in situ coupling of CeO2 nanodots and carbon spheres (CB) not only provides richer surface defects and larger specific surface areas, but also improves the electrical conductivity and obtains optimized electronic structures. When CeO2@CB is hybridized with NiFe-layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDHs), which is the typical oxygen evolution catalyst, the CeO2@CB/NiFe-LDH electrocatalyst shows improved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, with a lower overpotential of 203 mV at current density of 20 mAcm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. Therefore, this work provides a promising strategy for the construction of efficient co-catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0361-5235	1543-186X		WOS:000788958400002

Two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as doped graphene and atomically-thin transition metal compounds, have shown great promise as electrocatalysts for various renewable energy conversion and storage reactions. Their further developments require improved understanding of the catalytic mechanisms at atomic level. Currently, most of the understandings are based on the formation free energies of the intermediates, which are determined by their binding strengths with the catalyst, usually calculated from density functional theory (DFT). These energies/binding strengths have been used as descriptor to describe the activity of many catalysts. However, it remains less explored why different catalysts have different binding strengths and what are the underlying factors controlling them, requiring studies going beyond atomic level to electronic level. This review aims to provide such links, focusing on 2D electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER), CO2 reduction reaction (CO2R) and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). We also discuss some of the significant issues that need to be addressed in DFT calculations, including the effects of varying charge and fixed potential of the catalyst, the passivation of active sites, and the solvation effects.

Here, we present a novel kind of Zn-doped Co3O4 hollow dodecahedral electrocatalyst. Abundant oxygen vacancy defects are introduced due to the incorporation of Zn2+, which is beneficial for OH- adsorption and the charge transfer reaction during the OER process. Moreover, the increase in surface area caused by the advanced structure of the hollow porous dodecahedra facilitates mass transport by increasing the surface area.

The results revealed that the anodic activity and reaction kinetics varied a lot during the electrolysis for it is a process indicating the formation and stabilization of anodic layer. At the very beginning of electrolysis, the composite anode exhibited very high oxygen evolution activity since the reaction was controlled by the transformation step of intermediates. Then, its oxygen evolution activity was largely diminished and the rate determination step (rds) became the formation and adsorption of first intermediate, S-OHads. In the prolonged electrolysis, the anodic potential gradually decreased and the final stable value was comparable to industrial Pb-Ag (1.0%) anode. On the stable anodic layer after 72 h, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was still controlled by the formation and adsorption of intermediate, and the adsorption resistance took a dominant part in the whole impedance. Besides, compared with Pb-Ag and Pb anode, although OER at the stable state were all controlled by the intermediate adsorption process, the adsorption resistance of Pb/Pb-MnO2 anode was much smaller than the other two due to the existence of MnO2 particles and large amount of beta-PbO2 in the stable anodic layer.

The hydrogen evolution reaction proceeds via two basic mecbanisms; the reduction of H+ at pH < 4 and the reduction of H2O at higher pH values. Analytical expressions for the exchange current density for the hydrogen evolution reaction on Alloy 22 are also developed for the two mechanisms, in a form that they can be used in corrosion models for assessing the performance of this alloy in high level nuclear waste (HLNW) repositories. The kinetics of oxygen reduction have also been explored over wide ranges of pH and temperature. However, this reaction is complicated by the formation of H2O2 as an intermediate in a two-electron transfer reaction. Nevertheless, kinetic parameters have been obtained for this reaction and an expression has been developed that allows calculation of the exchange current density over a wide range of conditions. Finally, the kinetic data are used to identify probable mechanisms for hydrogen evolution and the reduction of oxygen on Alloy 22. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Oxygen electrocatalysis, involving the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), determines the overall performance of zinc-air batteries. Therefore, the development of highly efficient bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts is critical for the large-scale application of ZABs. Carbon-based nanomaterials have been widely reported to be efficient electrocatalysts toward both ORR and OER. The enhanced activity of these electrocatalysts are usually attributed to different doping defects, synergistic effects and even the intrinsic carbon defects. Herein, an overview of the defect engineering in carbon-based electrocatalysts for ORR and OER is provided. The different types of intrinsic carbon defects and strategies for the generation of other defects in carbon-based electrocatalysts are presented. The interaction of heteroatoms doped carbon and transition metals (TMs) is also explored.

Whereas this enhanced activity has been ascribed to a unique iron site within the nickel oxide matrix, we show here that Fe doping influences the Ni valency. The percent of Fe3+ doping promotes the formation of formal Ni4+, which in turn directly correlates with an enhanced activity of the catalyst in promoting OER. The role of Fe3+ is consistent with its behavior as a superior Lewis acid.									333	6	0	0	34	0	334			0027-8424			WOS:000393989300044	28137835

Intervention of the active component NiFe hydroxide not only promotes the dissociation of water but also reduces the energy barrier of the intermediate, while the presence of subsequent microwaves accelerates the electron transfer. m-NiFe@MnO2 showed excellent OER performance. This is prominently manifested in that when the current density reaches 100 mA cm(-2), the overpotential is only 310 mV, which is far better than RuO2. The long-term (>= 100 h) durability test also further proves its excellent stability.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1566-7367	1873-3905		WOS:000821316400005

Herein, the intrinsic relationship between the atomic structure and the catalytic activity of Ni3S2 was investigated based on density functional theory. It was found that the Ni3S2 (100) surface exhibits promising bifunctional catalytic activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The ORR catalytic activity of Ni3S2 (100) can be enhanced by the doping of Cu, and the OER catalytic activity of Ni3S2 (100) can be improved by the doping of Se. Furthermore, a descriptor derived from the electron affinity was developed, which correlate Ni3S2 microstructures with their catalytic activities.

Herein we report a ternary metallic-based MgNiO2/CoNC porous hollow nanocage composite, which was assembled with intimate contacted MgNiO2 and Co species to form ultrathin nanocage shells and serve as the ORR and OER active components, respectively, to produce a highly bi-functional catalytic performance. The possible synergy of each seamlessly connected metallic site renders the hybrid material with excellent ORR and OER activities, which outperform the corresponding benchmarks. Particularly, we speculate that such efficient catalytic activity might arise from the synergistic chemical coupling effects within MgNiO2/CoNC and, therefore, these results reveal promising prospects in developing multi-metallic composites toward efficient electrochemical energy devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2296-8016			WOS:000594830800001

Herein, nickel-based bicarbonates are, for the first time, developed as catalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis, and demonstrate superior electrocatalytic performance in alkaline media. Iron doping can significantly tune the real valence of nickel ions, and consequently tailor the electrocatalytic ability of bicarbonates. Among the nickel-based bicarbonates, Ni0.9Fe0.1(HCO3)(2) exhibits the highest bifunctional catalytic activity, with a potential difference of 0.86 V between the OER potential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and the ORR potential at a current density of -1 mA cm(-2), which outperforms most of the reported precious-metal-free catalysts. The present work provides new insights into exploring efficient catalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis, and it suggests that, in addition to the extensively studied transition metal hydroxides and oxides, bicarbonates and carbonates also show great potential as precious metal-free catalysts.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000451888300007	30193405

The main anodic reaction is oxygen evolution by decomposition of water. Traditional anode materials have been lead alloys that have high overpotential towards oxygen evolution. Oxide type anodes are more active but they are also more expensive. In this work, the activities of binary RuO2-TiO2 anodes were measured using different electrochemical techniques. The activity measurements were based on the measurement of the redox reaction between Ru(III) and Ru(IV) in cyclic voltammetry and on the oxygen evolution reaction in potentiostatic tests and galvanostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Factors related to intrinsic electrocatalytic properties and electrochemically active surface area could be separated. Above 30 mol% no significant increase in activity towards oxygen evolution is gained by increasing the concentration of active oxide. With low amount of active oxide most of the active sites are inside the pores and cracks. This will cause anode failure by bubble formation inside the anode. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, feasibly enhancing the participation of lattice oxygen is still challenging. Here we designed a perovskite cobaltate (La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.1Mn0.1O3-delta, LSCFM) nanofiber, and discovered that the co-incorporation of Fe/Mn elements significantly intensifies the involvement of lattice oxygen for OER. Compared with its mono-dopant (Fe or Mn only) counterparts, the LSCFM gives rise to higher surface oxygen vacancies (V-o) concentration and faster oxygen ion diffusion coefficient, endowing a small overpotential of 343 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and low Tafel slope of 63 mV dec(-1). The strongest pH-dependent activity and metal-oxygen covalency are further unveiled on LSCFM by experimental and theoretical approaches, evidencing that the promoted OER kinetics on LSCFM predominantly stems from the formation of reactive lattice oxygen site.									15	0	0	0	2	0	14			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000653229500283

Through microstructural characterization, electrochemical measurements, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we demonstrated that the entropy-stabilized oxide (Co0.2Mn0.2Ni0.2Fe0.2Zn0.2)Fe2O4 has a single-phase spinel structure and exhibits both efficient and stable catalytic oxygen evolution. This is attributable to disordered occupation of multivalent cations, which induces severe lattice distortion and increases configurational entropy, thereby facilitating formation of structurally stable, high-density oxygen vacancies on the exposed surface of the spinel. Thus, more catalytic sites on the surface are activated and retained over the course of long-duration testing for oxygen evolution. Entropy engineering expands researchers' access to catalysts that link entropy-stabilized structures to useful properties.									41	1	0	0	2	0	41			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000555417200030	32614574

The design and the development of cost-effective, robust, and high-performance catalysts that can convert oxygen to water, and vice versa, is a major challenge in energy conversion and storage technology. Here we report cobalt oxide nanochains as multifunctional catalysts for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at both alkaline and neutral pH, oxidant-driven, photochemical water oxidation in various pH, and the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline medium. The cobalt oxide nanochains are easily accessible on a multigram scale by low-temperature degradation of a cobalt oxalate precursor. What sets this study apart from earlier ones is its synoptical perspective of reversible oxygen redox catalysis in different chemical and electrochemical environments.									209	8	0	0	8	0	209			2155-5435			WOS:000352464400001

Herein, hierarchical Co9S8 hollow microspheres had been designed and synthesized by a facile hydrothermal reaction at 140 degrees C (denoted as Co9S8 HMs-140). The properties and formation process of the Co9S8 HMs-140 were systematically investigated. Owing to the composition and structure features, the Co9S8 HMs-140 can be used as a trifunctional catalyst for ORR, OER and HER in the same alkaline electrolyte. The Co9S8 HMs-140 shows reasonable ORR and HER performance. Additionally, OER performance of the Co9S8 HMs-140 is superior to that of RuO2, such as a low onset potential (1.47 V vs. RHE) and high stability. Furthermore, due to the bifunctional OER and HER activity of the Co9S8 HMs-140, the Co9S8 HMs-140 affords an O-2 efficiency of 31 mmol h (1) and a H-2 efficiency of 62 mmol h (1) at 1.60 V in 1 M KOH solution under the given time range, exhibiting a 96% faradaic yield in the process of full water splitting to produce O-2 and H-2. The present work will provide a promising prospect for the development of multifunctional transition metal sulfides as effective electrocatalysts for sustainable energy systems.

Three silica hard templates with different textural properties were used to increase the specific surface area of the perovskites, and hence to improve their electrochemical activity for both oxygen evolution and reduction reactions. Careful structural and physicochemical characterization revealed that the materials are composites formed by crystalline LSFM perovskite and amorphous metal silicates, even after the etching procedure. Both the composites' specific surface area and the fraction of silicates are proportional to the silicas pore volume. Interestingly, the LSFM perovskite obtained by SHT has lower cell volumes than the parent oxide prepared without a silica template. The electrochemical characterization revealed the contrasting effects of the metal silicates on the performances of the electrodes. The LSFM-SHT-based electrodes have higher double-layer capacitance and higher current for oxygen evolution than those prepared with the parent LSFM. Furthermore, the LSFM-SHT-based electrodes show a preferential 4-electron pathway during the oxygen reduction reaction, if the amount of amorphous silicates is low (Si wt % < 3.5 wt %). However, the silicates also shift the onset potential of both oxygen evolution and reduction reactions to more positive and negative potential values, respectively, thus delaying the two reactions.									3	1	0	0	1	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000458705800027

Using a rotating disk electrode (RDE), it is shown that at certain conditions the observed current, i.e., the reaction rate, does not depend on the kinetics but on diffusion properties; In fact we demonstrate how studying these reactions in 0.1M non-buffered aqueous electrolytes with pH-values ranging between pH 1 to pH 13, the diffusion coefficients of H+ and OH- ions can be determined. Within the experimental error limits, we found no pH dependency on the diffusion coefficients for any of the investigated ions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Highly active catalyst materials with excellent selectivity towards the desired reaction are certainly required for efficient processes. Understanding the underlying processes, including detailed in situ information, facilitates the design and development of catalyst materials. In this work, we utilize the scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy for the spatially resolved in situ investigation of the electrochemical and photoelectrochemical evolution of hydrogen, oxygen, reactive oxygen species, and chlorine for energy conversion. Herein, we demonstrate that the activity and the selectivity of the TiO2 photoelectrocatalyst are highly localized despite their apparently uniform composition based on regular morphological characterization. Furthermore, the results suggest that the illumination dramatically changes the selectivity in electrolysis reactions, which is demonstrated on the competing oxygen- and chlorine- evolution reaction. Consequently, this leads to the critical implication that the activity and selectivity should not be considered uniform per se, especially under the illumination. This implies that light might be used for controlling the selectivity in electrolysis reactions. Such discovery shall dramatically impact the optimization of photoelectrocatalysts in general.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000810444800004

After heating at 400 degrees C for 24 h, the spent cathode has LiCoO2 and Co3O4 in its composition. This new material was mixed with graphite and conformed in tablet for application as anode in oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solution (NaOH 6.0 mol L-1). The concentrations of cathode in this mixture were 0, 10, 20 and 50% in mass. The best condition was 10% in mass. Under this condition the evolution of oxygen reaches 1010 mA cm(-2), however, for pure graphite the current density reaches only 600 mA cm(-2).

However, this new battery technology is facing substantial challenges, such as a high overpotential upon charging, poor reversibility, and low power density. Using first-principles calculations, we study the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the low-index surfaces of lithium peroxide. The elementary reaction steps and the energy profile of the OER are identified on the low-index surfaces of lithium peroxide. We find that the OER processes are kinetically limited by the high energy barrier for the evolution of oxygen molecules and that the rate of the OER processes is highly dependent on the surface orientation.									180	8	0	0	10	0	186			2469-9950	2469-9969		WOS:000297295400016

We present in this work the application of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) for characterisation of bifunctional catalysts. By using model bifunctional catalysts based on oxides of cobalt (CoxOy) and nickel (NLOy) embedded in nitrogen doped carbon (NC), we specifically show the unique ability of using SECM to determine a range of the important electrocatalytic parameters including the selectivity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the initial mechanistic steps during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the onset potential for both ORR and OER in a single experiment. We were able to observe directly that prior to oxygen evolution, local depletion of oxygen occurs at the SECM tip during redox transition accompanying most likely metal oxyhydroxide formation thus enabling direct in situ observation of the initial mechanistic steps of the OER.									19	1	0	0	0	0	20			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000374841300018

Herein, we report a substrate-assisted in situ reduction method to prepare three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide (3DRGO) networks decorated with a range of mixed cobalt oxide and nickel oxide nanosheets as a new type of bifunctional catalyst for oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction. Among the different composite catalysts, Co3O4@3DRGO showed highest catalytic activities in OER and ORR with an excellent stability.

Cost-effective, abundant, and active Co-based materials have emerged as promising bifunctional electrocatalysts for which identifying catalytically active structures under reaction conditions and unraveling the structure activity relationships are of critical importance. Here, we report the size-dependent (3-10 nm) structure and catalytic activity of bifunctional cobalt oxide nanoparticle (CoOx NP) catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed that the majority of NPs during OER and ORR were composed of the Co3O4 and CoOOH phases regardless of their particle sizes. The OER activity increased with decreasing NP size, which correlated to the increased oxidation state and larger surface area in smaller NPs, whereas the ORR activity was nearly independent of NP size. These particle size-dependent catalytic activities in conjunction with the in situ XAS results can provide insights into the CoOx-catalyzed bifunctional oxygen electrode reactions.									94	5	0	0	4	0	94			2155-5435			WOS:000379457300035

J	Zhao, Dengke; Dai, Jiale; Zhou, Ni; Wang, Nan; Peng, Xinwen; Qu, Yunpeng; Li, Ligui								Prussian blue analogues-derived carbon composite with cobalt nanoparticles as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution								CARBON				142				196	205		10.1016/j.carbon.2018.10.057				FEB 2019	2019	Oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction are two key reactions involved in several renewable energy technologies. Herein, a nonprecious bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction is facilely synthesized through directly pyrolyzing the mixture of Prussian blue analogues, graphene oxide and graphitic carbon nitride in the presence of silica colloids. Post-synthesis removal of silica hard templates leads to a cobalt and nitrogen co-doped reduced graphene oxide composite with Co nanoparticles, which comprises abundant mesoporous textures and a high specific surface area of 703.26 cm(2) g(-1). The resultant composite shows marked oxygen reduction reaction activity, with a more positive half-wave potential of +0.848 V, a higher limiting current, a stronger immunity to fuel crossover effect and higher operation stability, as compared with commercial Pt/C catalyst in alkaline solution. Besides, such composite can also serve as efficient and stable hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst in alkaline electrolyte, and an over potential of only 180 mV is required to reach 10 mA cm(-2). The remarkable bifunctional catalytic activities are attributed to the synergistic effects of Co nanoparticles and graphene substrate. These results highlight the high potential of present strategy in synthesis of multifunctional nonprecious electrocatalysts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of those MWCNT-supported catalysts in alkaline and acidic solutions was studied by different electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltamperometry, chronoamperometry (CA) and galvanostatic measurement. The developed hybrid catalysts showed better performance in basic solution and in this media NiPc/MWCNT catalyst had shown better OER performance than FePc/MWCNT. The electrodes were resistive to passivation and had reasonable stability. The obtained results suggest that the MWCNT support plays an important role on the catalytic properties towards the OER.

Herein, Co9S8 loaded with S, N co-doped carbon core-shell catalyst (Co9S8@SNC) was reasonably designed and synthesized by using the strong coordination effect between Co2+ and C@S at the molecular level. The significant synergistic effect between the S, N co-doped carbon shell and Co9S8 core endows the catalyst with excellent catalytic performance for ORR, HER, and OER reactions. The carbon shell enhances the conductivity of the hybrid material, while the Co9S8 core provides the main catalytic active sites. More specifically, the half-wave potential for ORR is 0.846 mV, and the overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER are 320 mV and 170 mV, respectively. To test its practical application, zinc-air battery assembled by Co9S8@SNC shows a high power density of 239 mW cmz, excellent rechargeability, and long cyclic stability. This work provides a promising and extensible method to in-situ synthesize core-shell metal sulfides loaded S, N co doped carbon composites, which can be a promising candidate for electrocatalytic material in energy storage and conversion devices.

Producing branched nanoparticles is one potential solution. Controlling the number of branches and branch size of faceted branched nanoparticles is one of the major synthetic challenges to achieve highly active and stable nanocatalysts. Herein, we use a cubic-core hexagonal-branch mechanism to synthesize branched Ru nanoparticles with control over the size and number of branches. This structural control is the key to achieving high exposure of active {10-11} facets and optimum number of Ru branches that enables improved catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction while maintaining high stability.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000579140300001	32844508

The study includes the effect of each impurity and impurities combined on the alloy corrodibility, the efficiency of PbO2 formation, the rate of the self-discharge and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The results show that individual impurity enhances the corrosion resistance but increases the anode corrosion and the self-discharge rate. Impurities play opposite effects on hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction either individually or combined. Concerning water loss problem, the harmful effect of individual impurity on increasing oxygen evolution reaction is compensated by their suppression of hydrogen evolution reaction. The impurities combined suppress effectively both hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction relative to alloy without any impurity. Sb has the highest harmful effects on oxygen evolution reaction and the self-discharge but it is the best in the suppression of hydrogen evolution reaction. The impurities combined relatively improve the general corrosion resistance, the anode corrosion resistance and the self-discharge. The study supports higher tolerance levels of Cu, As and Sb in Pb-Ca-Sn grids, especially when present combined, than the recommended levels in the industry standards.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0933-5137	1521-4052		WOS:000328135400004

Rotating disc electrodes were made from commercial RuO2 catalysed DSA(R)'s and studied in steady state polarisation measurements, mainly iR-corrected polarisation curves. Effects of varying pH and electrolyte concentrations of chloride, chlorate and dichromate were investigated. It was found that at a pH of 6.5, typical for the chlorate process, oxygen evolution is an important side reaction favoured by the dichromate buffer. At potentials lower than the reversible potential for chlorine evolution, oxygen evolution is limited by the transport of protons away from the anode surface. At pH > 4 the slope of the polarisation curve for chlorine evolution was higher than 35-40 mV/decade of current found on RuO2 in more acidic chloride solutions. The reaction order with respect to chloride for the chlorine evolution reaction at pH 6.5 was found to be one.

Here, we report a viable strategy for tuning the size of a Co-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF). As a result, a nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon-supported ultrafine Co nanoparticle electrocatalyst (Co/NGC-3) with multifunctional activity was developed. Owing to the smaller ZIF-67 polyhedrons with relatively uniform distribution, more effective active sites, and a strong coupling effect of Co-pyridinic-N, the proposed Co/NGC-3 catalyst exhibited an impressive HER activity. It also showed brilliant catalytic activity in both the ORR and OER, delivering a more positive half-wave potential and a lower overpotential than that of the Pt/C catalyst, respectively. Moreover, the Co/NGC-3 involved the Zn-air battery displayed satisfactory power density, excellent energy density, and superior stability. This approach provides an efficient strategy for the preparation of high-performance multifunctional electrocatalysts for energy-related applications.									51	1	0	0	3	0	51			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000512216900050	31909962

Here we show that Fe cations bound to the surface of oxidized Au exhibit enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. We find that the OER activity increases with increasing surface concentration of Fe. Density functional theory analysis of the OER energetics reveals that oxygen evolution over Fe cations bound to a hydroxyl-terminated oxidized Au (Fe-Au2O3) occurs at an overpotential similar to 0.3 V lower than over hydroxylated Au2O3 (0.82 V). This finding agrees well with experimental observations and is a consequence of the more optimal binding energetics of OER reaction intermediates at Fe cations bound to the surface of Au2O3. These findings suggest that the enhanced OER activity reported recently upon low-potential cycling of Au may be due to surface Fe impurities rather than to "superactive" Au-III surfaquo species.									36	1	0	0	2	0	36			2196-0216			WOS:000371253500009

When the urchin-like peapoded NiCo2O4@C electrodes are integrated into the two-electrode system for alkaline overall water splitting, the potential as small as 1.608 V is a requisite for the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Given high activity and long-term stability, the harvested urchin-like peapoded NiCo2O4@C is of great potential for practical application.									44	7	0	0	1	0	45			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000418392100007

In this work, using cobalt manganese oxyhydroxide, an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst that can be grown directly on various electrodes as a model system, it is demonstrated that breaking a continuous film into discontinuous patches can significantly enhance the overall OER performance without sacrificing long-term stability even under elevated electrocatalytic stress. Discontinuous films with higher edge-to-area ratios exhibits reduced overpotentials, increased turnover frequency, and more pronounced current increase after electrochemical conditioning. Operando Raman spectroscopy studies during electrocatalysis reveal that the film edges require lower potential barrier for activation. Introducing discontinuity into thin film electrocatalysis can thus lead to the realization of high performance yet highly robust systems for harsh gas evolution reactions.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000490472000001	31608571

This research area is being driven by a need to replace scarce noble metal-based catalysts in energy technologies. We describe recent advances in nanosheet electrocatalysis of oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, hydrogen evolution, and CO2 reduction reactions. We find at this early stage of development that nanosheet catalysis has surpassed classical noble metal catalysts in several of these applications and is showing high potential in others. CO2 reduction to methane is now catalyzed best by metal-free carbon nanosheets. These trends will likely transform heterogeneous catalysis.									170	15	0	0	3	0	171			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000399390300003

Considering limited electrocatalysts have good oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity in acid solution while numerous economical materials show excellent OER catalytic performance in alkaline solution, developing new strategies that enhance the alkaline hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER) catalytic activity of cost-effective catalysts is highly desirable for achieving highly efficient overall water splitting. Herein, it is demonstrated that synergistic regulation of water dissociation and optimization of hydrogen adsorption free energy on electrocatalysts can significantly promote alkaline HER catalysis. Using oxygen-incorporated Co2P as an example, the synergistic effect brings about 15-fold enhancement of alkaline HER activity. Theory calculations confirm that the water dissociation free energy of Co2P decreases significantly after oxygen incorporation, and the hydrogen adsorption free energy can also be optimized simultaneously. The finding suggests the powerful effectiveness of synergetic regulation of water dissociation and optimization of hydrogen adsorption free energy on electrocatalysts for alkaline HER catalysis.									211	8	0	0	8	0	212			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000406030900011	28513886

However, current ZABs suffer from poor energy efficiency and cyclability, mainly owing to the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the air electrode. Therefore, rational design of efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts with high activity and stability is essential for improving battery performance. Carbon-based nanomaterials are promising candidates for bifunctional oxygen catalysis. In this review, we present the latest development of carbon-based bifunctional electrocatalysts for ZABs. Firstly, the related reaction mechanisms of bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts are introduced. Then, the recent advances in developing carbon-based bifunctional catalysts with tailored structure and promising catalytic performance are introduced following the regulation strategies, e. g., heteroatom doping, defect engineering, and/or hybridizing with other active materials. Finally, the key challenges and perspectives of advanced ZABs are provided to better shed light on future research.									76	4	0	0	4	0	76				2566-6223		WOS:000483785900002

Herein, three-dimensional lily-like CoNi2S4 supported on nickel foam (CoNi2S4/Ni) has been fabricated by sulfuration of the Co-Ni precursor. As expected, CoNi2S4/Ni possesses such outstanding electrocatalytic properties that it requires an overpotential of only 54 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 328 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively. Furthermore, by utilizing the CoNi2S4/Ni electrodes as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) can be obtained at a voltage of only 1.56 V.

In this study, the facile synthesis of a novel rose-like nanocomposite catalyst (Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O4) is reported. The synthesis process includes a solvothermal step and a phosphatization step to combine iron oxides and iron-nickel phosphides. Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O4 performs well in catalyzing oxygen evolution reaction, with a very low overpotential of 365 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) current density. The Tafel slope is as low as 59 mV dec(-1). Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O4 has a large double-layer capacitance that contributes to a high electrochemically active area. Moreover, this catalyst is very stable for long-term use. Therefore, the Ni2P/Fe2P/Fe3O4 catalyst has a high potential for use in oxygen evolution reactions.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000476182800001	31222970

The MEA parameters including gas diffusion layer, ionomer content, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) type, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, and catalyst loading were optimized by calculating the round-trip efficiency of URFC. The performance in FC mode was largely affected by the MEA parameters compared to that of the WE mode performance. The FC mode performance is crucial for the achievement of high URFC performance. The optimized round-trip efficiency was 49% at 500 mAcm(-2), which is comparable or superior to that reported in literature. This result can be attributed to the highly efficient MEA structure suitable for bifunctional catalysts to participate in both ORR and OER.

Owing to the improvement of accessible active sites by boron doping, the synthesized catalyst can reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.54 V with a low overpotential of 310 mV, superior than those of commercial RuO2 and N-doped C/Co3O4.

Despite recent efforts to achieve fast gas reactant delivery to the reaction interface, efficient gas product evolution from the catalyst/electrolyte interface remains challenging. Inspired by the mammalian breathing process, here we developed an efficient electrocatalytic system to enable ample gas-solid-liquid three-phase contact lines and bidirectional gas pathways for evolution and consumption. During the oxygen evolution reaction, the newly formed O-2 molecules quickly diffuse to the gas phase, waiving the bubble formation energy in the electrolyte. A record low overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) was achieved using Au/NiFeOx catalysts. During the oxygen reduction reaction, O-2 gas can transport to the catalyst/electrolyte interface, overcoming low O-2 solubility in water and leading to similar to 25-fold higher current densities for Ag/Pt bilayer nanoparticle catalysts. This breathing-mimicking design demonstrates efficient three-phase catalysis with a minimal catalyst thickness.									34	2	0	0	4	0	35			2542-4351			WOS:000460076100021

Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)								e2107956	e2107956		10.1002/adma.202107956				2022-Jul-19	2022	Electron transfer process during oxygen evolution reaction often either proceed solely via a metal redox chemistry (adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), with metal bands around the Fermi level) or an oxygen redox chemistry (lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM), with oxygen bands around the Fermi level). Unlike AEM, LOM involves oxygen redox chemistry instead of metal redox, which leads to the formation of a direct oxygen-oxygen (O-O) bond. As a result, such process is able to bypass the rate-determining step, i.e., O-O bonding, in AEM, which highlights the critical advantage of LOM as compared to the conventional AEM. Thus, it has been well reported that LOM-based catalysts were able to demonstrate higher OER activities as compared to AEM-based catalysts. Here, a comprehensive understanding of the oxygen redox in LOM and all documented and possible characterization techniques that can be used to identify the oxygen redox are reviewed. This review will interpret the origins of oxygen redox in the reported LOM-based electrocatalysts and the underlying science of LOM-induced surface reconstruction in transition metal oxides. Finally, the perspectives on the future development of LOM electrocatalysts will also be provided. This article is protected by copyright.

The Co can not only create a well-defined heterointerface with beta-Mo2C but also overcomes the poor OER activity of beta-Mo2C, thus leading to enhanced electrocatalytic activity for HER and OER. DFT calculations further proved that cooperation between the N-CNTs, Co, and beta-Mo2C results in lower energy barriers of intermediates and thus greatly enhances the HER and OER performance. This study not only provides a simple strategy for the construction of heterostructures with nonprecious metals, but also provides in-depth insight into the HER and OER mechanism in alkaline solution.									482	30	0	0	29	0	483			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000463739900020	30635963

However, the inadequacy of highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts has impeded the development of this technology. Amorphous materials with long-range disordered structures have exhibited superior electrocatalytic performance compared to their crystalline counterparts due to more active sites and higher structural flexibility. This review summarizes the preparation methods of amorphous materials involving oxides, hydroxide, phosphides, sulfides, and their composites, and introduces the recent progress of amorphous OER electrocatalysts in acidic and alkaline media. Finally, the existing challenges and future perspectives for amorphous electrocatalysts for OER are discussed. Therefore, we believe that this review will guide designing amorphous OER electrocatalysts with high performance for future energy applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2296-2646			WOS:000867451100001	36238105

Extended Abstracts of the Fourth International Symposium on New Materials for Electrochemical Systems								102	4						2001	2001	Nickel hydroxide is a successful cathode active material used in various alkaline batteries: nickel-cadmium, nickel-iron, nickel-zinc, nickel-hydrogen, and most recently, in nickel-metal hydride systems. Two distinct couples, beta-Ni(OH)2/beta-NiOOH and alpha-Ni(OH)2/gamma-NiOOH, can participate in the charge-discharge reactions of the nickel electrode. The charge process of nickel electrode occurs usually in competition with oxygen evolution reaction. For an efficient charge of nickel cathode, the oxygen evolution must be minimized.

The resolved current-potential profiles for the formation/reduction of surface oxides and the deposition/dissolution of H at a RuTi electrode are basically similar to those at an elemental-Ru electrode. However, whereas the oxygen-evolution and Ru-corrosion reactions occur at nearly the same potential on elemental Ru, these reactions are well resolved on RuTi alloy; the Ru-corrosion reaction is shifted anodically by about 400 mV. RuTi alloy does not catalyze the methanol-oxidation reaction; it forms a hydride on cycling negative of the normal hydrogen potential. Although hydride formation appears to suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction, nevertheless the hydrogen-evolution activity remains relatively high. Interpretation of this behavior has been made with a model that involves a two-step oxidation of the alloy surface; the second step involves the migration of metal atoms as cation species to form a gelatinous layer of octahedrally coordinated cations and the inhibition of RuO4 formation by more basic Ru-O-M bridges.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0013-4686			WOS:A1991EQ01700004

The oxygen evolution reaction at Ti/Pt/PbO2 eletrode in surphuric acid solutions is characterized by two linear phi similar to lgi relationships. At low e.d. it is close to 2.303RT/(1+beta)F, whereas at high c.d. it is close to 2.303RT/beta F. In the Ag(I) or Ni(II) ions in the electrolytic solution the Tafel slope of oxygen evolution tends to be low, 2.303RT/(1+beta)F (with beta=0.5). However, the oxygen evolution reaction at Pt electrodes in H2SO4 or CoSO4+H2SO4 solutions is characterized by one linear phi similar to lgi relationship. The Tafel slope is close to 2.303RT/beta F. In the presence of Ag(I) or Ni(II) ions in the electrolytic solution the Tafel slope of oxygen evolution tends to be low, 2.303RT/(1+beta)F. The oxygen anodic evolution reactions are catalyzed by Ag(I), Co(II) and Ni(II) ions in the electrolytic solution. When Ag(I) or Ni(II) was mixed with Co(II), a promising catalyst for oxygen anodic evolution with higher catalytic activity than either of them alone was found.

The CoTe2 catalyst exhibited superior OER activity compared to the CoTe catalyst, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art RuO2 catalyst. Density functional theory calculations showed that the binding strength and lateral interaction of the reaction intermediates on CoTe2 and CoTe are essential for determining the overpotential required under different conditions.

To date, transition metal sulfides (TMSs) have become alternatives to replace noble metal-based (RuO2 and IrO2) catalysts because of their excellent catalytic activity. Hence, a facile method through one-step solvothermal is proposed to synthesize nanoflower-like Co1-xS/CoS2-2 as efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction. The obtained electrocatalyst has improved charge-transfer kinetics of the sulfidation process and accelerated gas diffusion enabled by nanosheets structure.

The relationship between the Ni-P properties and catalytic activity allowed us to define the best conditions for the electroless synthesis of highperformance Ni-P catalysts. Indeed, the electrochemical investigations indicated an increased catalytic response by reducing the thickness and Ni/P ratio in the alloy. Furthermore, the Ni-P catalysts with optimized size and composition deposited on Ni foam exposed more active sites for the oxygen evolution reaction, yielding a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential as low as 335 mV, exhibiting charge transfer resistances of only a few ohms and a remarkable turnover frequency (TOF) value of 0.62 s(-1) at 350 mV. The present study provides an advancement in the control of the electroless synthetic approach for the design and large-scale application of high-performance metal phosphide catalysts for electrochemical water splitting.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8				2079-4991		WOS:000727068600001	34835772

Zinc-air batteries (ZABs), which are safer and more cost-effective power sources than commercial lithium-ion batteries, hinge on ORR and OER. The slow kinetics of the air electrode reduce its high theoretical energy density and specific capacity, which limits its practical applications. Thus, tuning the performance of the electrocatalyst and cathode architecture is vital for improving the performance of ZABs, which calls for exploring spinel, a material that delivers improved performance. However, the structure-activity relationship of spinel is still unclear because there is a lack of extensive information about it. This study was performed to address the promising potential of spinel as the bifunctional electrocatalyst in ZABs based on an in-depth understanding of spinel structure and active sites at the atomic level.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20				2076-3417		WOS:000535541900178

Herein, alpha-Co(OH)(2) nanoplates (average thickness of 8-10 nm) are uniformly distributed on polypyrrole/graphene oxide by a very facile method because of coordinating Co2+ with -NH- segments in polypyrrole chains. The electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction can be efficiently improved by alpha-Co(OH)(2)/ polypyrrole/graphene oxide as electrocatalysts with high activity, strong durability and good stability by the synergies between components and the remarkable hierarchical nanostructures, whose overpotential and Tafel slope can be achieved to 350 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2) and 74.5 mV dec(-1), respectively. The introduction of polypyrrole not only enhances the nanocomposite conductivity, which effectively facilitates the electronic transmission of oxygen evolution reaction, but also optimizes the uniform distribution of alpha-Co(OH)(2) nanoplates on polypyrrole/graphene oxide, which results in more exposed active sites ascribed to the excellent hierarchical nanostructures. Therefore, conducting polymers as the supports for transition metal compounds can efficiently improve its electrocatalytic performance of oxygen evolution reaction, which will be beneficial to electrocatalytic water splitting.									16	2	0	0	2	0	17			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000472183900064

That calls for a comprehensive understanding of oxygen electrocatalysis for efficient catalyst design. Current opinions on oxygen electrocatalysis have been focused on the thermodynamics of the reactant/intermediate adsorption on the catalysts. Because the oxygen molecule is paramagnetic, its production from or its reduction to diamagnetic hydroxide/water involves spin-related electron transfer. Both electron transfer and orbital interactions between the catalyst and the reactant/intermediate show spin-dependent character, making the reaction kinetics and thermodynamics sensitive to the spin configurations. Herein, a brief introduction on the spintronic explanation of the catalytic phenomena on oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is given. The local spin configurations and orbital interactions in the benchmark transition-metal-based catalysts for OER and ORR are analyzed as examples. To further understand the spintronic oxygen electrocatalysis and to develop more efficient spintronic catalysts, the challenges are summarized and future opportunities proposed. Spin electrocatalysis may emerge as an important topic in the near future and help integrate a comprehensive understanding of oxygen electrocatalysis.									92	4	0	0	8	0	90			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000557379700001	32776367

Emerging macroscopically nanostructured catalysts are strongly requested for superior electrocatalytic activities and practical applications. Here, a 3D hydroxysulfide monolith with anion-regulated NiFe hydroxysulfide nanosheets is rationally proposed. With abundant active sites and unique structure, the as-obtained hydroxysulfide monolith exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance in oxygen evolution, hydrogen evolution, and oxygen reduction in alkaline electrolyte. When directly serving as electrodes, a small charge/discharge voltage gap of 0.76 V at 2.0 mA cm(-2) and a high peak power density of 248 mW cm(-2) are achieved for the liquid Zn-air batteries, and a low cell voltage of 1.62 V at 10 mA cm(-2) is detected for water splitting units.

This work reports the observation of bifunctional electrocatalytic properties for water-splitting in layered oxides, featuring 2-dimensional layers of octahedrally coordinated transition metals separated by alkaline-earth or rare-earth metals. Remarkably, these materials are able to catalyze both half-reactions of water-splitting, i. e., oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER). Electrical charge-transport studies of SrLaFe1-xCoxO4-delta in a wide range of temperatures, 25 to 800 degrees C, indicate semiconducting behavior for all three compounds, where there is a systematic increase in electrical conductivity as a function of temperature. The end member of the series, SrLaCoO4-delta, exhibits the highest electrical charge transport and best electrocatalytic activity toward both OER and HER. This catalyst also features the highest degree of polyhedral distortion as well as the presence of oxygen-vacancies. In addition, the transition metals in this material have a favorable electronic configuration for enhanced electrocatalytic activity.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000671367700001

While the formation of ligand hole for perovskites is well-known for solid state physicists and/or chemists and has been widely studied for the understanding of important electronic properties such as superconductivity, insulator-metal transitions, magnetoresistance, ferroelectrics, redox properties etc., oxygen electrocatalysis in aqueous media at low temperature barely scratches the surface of the concept of oxygen ions oxidation. In this review, we briefly explain the electronic structure of perovskite materials and go through a few important parameters such as the ionization potential, Madelung potential, and charge transfer energy that govern the oxidation of oxygen ions. We then describe the surface reactivity that can be induced by the redox activity of the oxygen network and the formation of highly reactive surface oxygen species before describing their participation in catalytic reactions and providing mechanistic insights and strategies for designing new (electro) catalysts. Finally, we give a brief overview of the different techniques that can be employed to detect the formation of such transient oxygen species.									50	1	1	0	1	0	51			2073-4344			WOS:000404099100024

The activity of OER catalysts has often been justified using single variables widely known as descriptors, which can provide mechanistic insights and accelerate rational design. This mini-review outlines recent advances in the discovery and application of these descriptors in both homogeneous and heterogeneous OER catalysis, and outlines the obstacles and opportunities which lie ahead in descriptor-led catalyst design strategies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2451-9103			WOS:000836472200007

Initially, oxidation of CNHs followed by thermal treatment with the Lawesson's reagent resulted in the formation of S-CNHs with the sulfur content determined as high as 3%. The S-CNHs were thoroughly characterized by spectroscopic, thermal and electron microscopy imaging means and then electrocatalytically screened. Specifically, S-CNHs showed excellent activity and durability for both O-2 and H-2 evolution reactions, by showing low overpotential at 1.63 and -0.2 V vs. RHE for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively. Additionally, S-CNHs showed significantly lower Tafel slope value and lower current resistance compared to oxidized and pristine CNHs for both electrocatalytic reactions. The outstanding electrocatalytic properties and high conductivity, along with the high S-doping level, render S-CNHs a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2079-4991		WOS:000602386400001	33287153

Oxygen in the lattice was reported recently to actively participate in surface reactions. Herein, we report a sacrificial template-directed approach to synthesize Mo-doped NiFe (oxy)hydroxide with modulated oxygen activity as an enhanced electrocatalyst towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The obtained MoNiFe (oxy)hydroxide displays a high mass activity of 1910 A/g(metal) at the overpotential of 300 mV. The combination of density functional theory calculations and advanced spectroscopy techniques suggests that the Mo dopant upshifts the O 2p band and weakens the metal-oxygen bond of NiFe (oxy)hydroxide, facilitating oxygen vacancy formation and shifting the reaction pathway for OER. Our results provide critical insights into the role of lattice oxygen in determining the activity of (oxy)hydroxides and demonstrate tuning oxygen activity as a promising approach for constructing highly active electrocatalysts.While (oxy)hydroxides are effective oxygen evolution electrocatalysts, the impacts of pre-catalyst properties on catalyst activities are challenging to assess. Here, authors find Mo dopants in Ni-Fe (oxyhydroxides) to promote lattice oxygen participation and to boost oxygen evolution activities.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2041-1723		WOS:000785003900005	35449165

Typically, hydrogen evolution reaction is considered as the only cathodic reaction during Mg corrosion. However, recent works demonstrate importance of considering oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as a second cathodic process at specific conditions. With oxygen micro-optode, we show that ORR rate was higher on slower corroding ultra-high-purity Mg (UHP-Mg), while lower on faster corroding commercially pure Mg (CP-Mg), where massive hydroxide layer impeded oxygen permeation. These findings shed light on yet another facet of complex mechanism of Mg corrosion.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20				2397-2106		WOS:000602932300001

In a traditional water-splitting electrolyzer, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) proceed simultaneously, which brings some challenges: a gas mixture of H-2 and O-2, produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), using unstable renewable energy efficiently, the OER sluggish kinetics and system durability. Recently, to avoid these issues completely, much effort has been made to optimize conventional water electrolysis. Among them, a decoupling/coupling strategy has become a new type of water electrolysis technology. The decoupling strategy divides water splitting into two steps through the introduction of a redox mediator, which can completely separate the production of H-2 and O-2 in time. The coupling strategy refers to the formation of a redox coupling of the HER and other sacrificial additive oxidation reactions instead of the sluggish OER. This coupling strategy not only avoids the production of explosive hydrogen/oxygen mixtures and ROS, but reduces the voltage input, improves the energy conversion efficiency, and may produce valuable by-products. In this review, we will discuss these two water electrolysis strategies separately and provide comprehensive insight into and reference for the development of a novel water-splitting electrolyzer.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2399-1984		WOS:000704143600001

To date, extensive studies on oxygen evolution from water splitting have focused on-visible-light harvesting. However, capturing low-energy photons for oxygen evolution, such as near-infrared (NIR) light, is challenging and not well-understood. This report presents new insights into photocatalytic water oxidation using visible and NIR light. WO2-WO3 hybrid nanorods were in situ fabricated using a wet-chemistry route. The presence of metallic WO2 strengthens light absorption and promotes the charge-carrier separation of WO3. The efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction over noble metal-free WO2-WO3 hybrids was found to be significantly promoted. More importantly, NIR light (>= 700 nm) can be effectively trapped to cause the photocatalytic water oxidation reaction. The oxygen evolution rates are even up to around 220 (lambda = 700 nm) and 200 (lambda = 800 nm) mmol g(-1) h(-1). These results demonstrate that the WO2-WO3 material is highly active for water oxidation with low-energy photons and opens new opportunities for multichannel solar energy conversion.									35	0	0	0	2	0	35			0743-7463			WOS:000389866300011	27951691

In this work, the electronic properties and electrocatalytic activity of precious metals (PM) adsorbed silicene are studied based on density functional theory (DFT). The results show that Ru-, Rh-, Pd-, Os-, Ir-, and Pt-adsorbed silicene at the H-site are more stable. Secondly, From the comparative analysis of the adsorption energy and free energy of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) intermediates and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) intermediates of the stable adsorption systems, it can be concluded that the Ru, Rh, and Ir adsorption systems can promote the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process, while the Rh adsorption system has good oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. Besides, the electronic properties of precious metals (PM) adsorbed silicene are also discussed. Our theoretical studies indicated that silicene supported precious metals (PM) have good electrocatalytic performance, which could contribute to the application of silicene in electrocatalysis in the future.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000656898900007

Beginning with the introduction of some evaluation criteria for the OER, the current OER electrocatalysts are reviewed, with the classification of metals/alloys, oxides, hydroxides, chalcogenides, phosphides, phosphates/borates, and other compounds, along with their advantages and shortcomings. The current knowledge of the reaction mechanisms and practical applications of the OER is also summarized for developing more efficient OER electrocatalysts. Finally, the current states, challenges, and some perspectives for non-noble-metal-based OER electrocatalysts are discussed.									407	24	0	0	15	0	409			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000513565000001

Here, we explored N-doped graphene as costeffective electrocatalysts for these key reactions by employing density functional theory (DFT). The results show that the substitution of carbon at graphene edge by nitrogen results in the best performance in terms of overpotentials. For armchair nanoribbons, the lowest OER and ORR overpotentials were estimated to be 0.405 V and 0.445 V, respectively, which are comparable to those for Pt-containing catalysts. OER and ORR with the minimum overpotentials can occur near the edge on the same structure but different sites. These calculations suggest that engineering the edge structures of the graphene can increase the efficiency of the N-doped graphene as efficient OER/ORR electrocatalysts for metal-air batteries, water splitting, and regenerative fuel cells.

This indicates that the currently utilized classes of electrocatalysts may not be adequate for future needs. This study reports on synthesis and characterization of a new class of materials based on 2D transition metal dichalcogenides including sulfides, selenides, and tellurides of group V and VI transition metals that exhibit excellent catalytic performance for both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in an aprotic medium with Li salts. The reaction rates are much higher for these materials than previously reported catalysts for these reactions. The reasons for the high activity are found to be the metal edges with adiabatic electron transfer capability and a cocatalyst effect involving an ionic-liquid electrolyte. These new materials are expected to have high activity for other core electrocatalytic reactions and open the way for advances in energy storage and catalysis.									33	2	0	0	1	0	34			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000456325900023	30500098

Shungite exhibits a disordered and amorphous structure with highly irregular building blocks. Shungite incorporates metals in its structure; typically catalytic elements such Fe and Ni are present, as well as the toxic elements Pb and As at mgg(-1) levels. We show here that incorporation of the metals in the carbon matrix of shungite leads into synergistic catalytic effect. We investigate the application of shungite in energy related electrochemical catalytic reactions, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). All elements have a synergetic effect, thus contributing for shungite's interesting catalytic performance towards a different range of electrochemical reactions, outperforming other tested carbon allotropes, such as carbon black, metal loaded carbon nanotubes, fullerene, and glassy carbon. These findings have profound impact on the application of the natural carbon materials for catalysis.									10	1	2	0	2	0	12			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000423349600021	28913844

Here, we report that the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be efficiently catalyzed by cobalt tetrahedra, which are stabilized over the surface of a Swedenborgite-type YBCo4O7 material. We reveal that the surface of YBaCo4O7 possesses strong resilience towards structural amorphization during OER, which originates from its distinctive structural evolution toward electrochemical oxidation. The bulk of YBaCo4O7 composes of corner-sharing only CoO4 tetrahedra, which can flexibly alter their positions to accommodate the insertion of interstitial oxygen ions and mediate the stress during the electrochemical oxidation. The density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the OER is efficiently catalyzed by a binuclear active site of dual corner-shared cobalt tetrahedra, which have a coordination number switching between 3 and 4 during the reaction. We expect that the reported active structural motif of dual corner-shared cobalt tetrahedra in this study could enable further development of compounds for catalyzing the OER.Efficient oxygen evolution relies on the development of promising catalysts. Herein, the authors demonstrate that cobalt tetrahedra, stabilized over the surface of YBCo4O7 material, can catalyze oxygen evolution reaction efficiently.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2041-1723		WOS:000856140700025	36127321

Structurally long-range ordered materials are increasingly finding utility for electrocatalytic applications. Such ordered structures can achieve unique functions that increase the electrocatalytic activity compared to corresponding electrocatalysts with a disordered structure. Effective strategies for designing high-performance electrocatalysts based on structurally ordered materials are presented. This review also summarizes the recent progress on structurally ordered materials as efficient electrocatalysts and highlights the applications in several representative electrochemical reactions, such as, the oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction. The structural features of the atomic long-range ordered framework and superior electrochemical performance are demonstrated by advanced characterization techniques (structural identification) and electrochemical measurements (performance evaluations), respectively. Special attention is paid to the establishment of a structure-activity relationship to highlight the advantages of the ordered structure. Finally, the remaining challenges and emerging opportunities in these related materials are proposed.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000688019300001

Herein, a simple construction strategy was adopted to design the NiFe hydroxide nanosheet arrays with composition gradient for efficient oxygen evolution. The continuous gradient changes constructed efficient electron transmission channels and modified the NiOOH local electronic environment which optimized binding strength to oxygen evolution intermediates.

However, the synthesis of hollow nanostructured metal phosphides, especially nonspherical hollow nanostructures, is rarely reported. Herein, we develop a metal-organic framework (MOF)-based strategy to synthesize carbon incorporated Ni-Co mixed metal phosphide nanoboxes (denoted as NiCoP/C). The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is selected as a demonstration to investigate the electrochemical performance of the NiCoP/C nanoboxes. For comparison, Ni-Co layered double hydroxide (Ni-Co LDH) and Ni-Co mixed metal phosphide (denoted as NiCoP) nanoboxes have also been synthesized.

Kinetic studies on electrodes subjected to different pre-treatment routines, yielded different values of the Tafel slope and the reaction order with respect to OH-activity. Only one mechanistic pathway could account for all observed values of these kinetic parameters. This pathway is similar, although not identical, to that proposed, in the first paper of this series, for the reaction at oxide covered Ni anodes. Using cyclic voltammetry it was shown that the mechanism for the initial passivation of Co electrodes varies with OH-concentration. This in turn can have an effect on the experimental value of the OER Tafel slope, a phenomenon which can be rationalized in terms of a dual energy barrier model.									132	3	2	0	5	0	135			1452-3981			WOS:000265311800006

Herein, two different types of three-dimensional (3D) radial alpha-MnO2 (dandelion- and urchin-like) catalysts are readily fabricated via two different redox reactions through the hydrothermal method, and their electrocatalytic activities are studied for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As a result, the dandelion-like alpha-MnO2 exhibits a higher electrocatalytic performance than urchin-like alpha-MnO2, with a lower overpotential (20 mV lower for ORR and 90 mV lower for OER), higher mass activity and lower Tafel slope. The excellent electrocatalytic activity of dandelion-like alpha-MnO2 can be attributed to its relatively larger BET and electrochemical active surface area, richer defects, higher amount of Mn3+, and less charge transfer resistance. Our results shed insights into developing new way in constructing the deficient alpha-MnO2 bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This excludes stability evaluation under start/stop conditions in a fuel cell or in reversible batteries in which the catalyst is alternately polarised to high opposite potentials. For example, the poor cyclability of metal-air batteries is mainly due to the decrease in the oxygen reduction activity of electrocatalysts during the high applied potentials for the oxygen evolution reaction during battery charging. To investigate and at least partially mitigate the loss of electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction, we employed reductive pulses with the aim of restoring the catalytic activity of the active sites for the oxygen reduction reaction. Optimisation of the reductive pulse parameters makes it possible to substantially prolong the oxygen reduction activity of a Fe-N-x-doped carbon-based oxygen reduction electrocatalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000633162800007

Compared with the single-phase obtained by the traditional calcination method, the CoFe2O4 and Co3O4 phase were obtained by the plasma method. The multivalence states of cobalt and iron facilitated electron transport in electrochemical reactions. The plasma sample had a small particle size (5 nm) due to the low operation temperature. Notably, electron impact produced more oxygen vacancies and a larger surface area on CoxFeyO4, which increased the active sites and electronic conductivity. Electrochemical investigations indicated that the multiphase spinel obtained with a quasi-four-electron transfer process showed an onset potential of 0.76 V versus the RHE for the oxygen reduction reaction. In the oxygen evolution reaction, the potential of current density at 10 mA cm(-2) was 1.53 V versus RHE. As for the overall electrocatalytic activity, the multiphase spinel had a Delta E (the difference between E-10(OER) and E-1/2(ORR)) of 0.89 V, exhibiting greater bifunctional activity than the other prepared catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000800314400001	35616539

Bimetal sulfides are recently emerged as effective catalysts for electrochemical oxygen evolution. In this study, Ni-Co bimetal sulfide nanounits loaded on N, S-codoped graphene nanosheets were synthesized, which were then evaluated as the catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline medium. An obvious enhancement of the catalytic activity is demonstrated by the introduction of N, S-codoped graphene nanosheets as conductive substrates. With the optimized Ni-Co sulfide/N, S-codpoed graphene composites, the overpotential is only 272 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, much lower than those of pristine Ni-Co sulfide (434 mV) and Ni-Co sulfide loaded on reduced graphene oxide (335 mV). The improved electrocatalytic activity of Ni-Co sulfide/N, S-codpoed graphene can be attributed to the improved electrochemical active specific area due to the synergistic effect between nickel sites and cobalt sites, the substrate effect of N, S co-doped graphene. These findings would provide new hints for the design and development of sulfide-based oxygen evolution catalyst.									23	2	0	0	0	0	24			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000498641500046

Despite the various efforts that have been made to understand and tune the active sites for oxygen evolution reaction, an insight into the configurations of active sites from the electronic perspective is still lacking. Here, we report an atomic doping strategy to break the Oh symmetry of the CoO6 octahedron in LiCoO2. The specific activity of the La-doped LiCoO2 was 3.14 mA cm(-2) at the overpotential of 0.35 V, which was 8.3 times higher than that of pristine LiCoO2. The overpotential with a value of 330 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) was the lowest among the LiCoO2-based OER electrocatalysts ever reported. Mechanistic studies revealed that the superior activity originated from the asymmetric octahedral coordination of Co, resulting in the enhanced electronic conductivity and Co-O hybridization for the accelerated oxygen evolution kinetics. This work opens a door to enhance the catalytic performance through the manipulation of local symmetry.									21	2	0	0	1	0	22			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000502687500053	31675477

Electrocatalytic water splitting is an eco-friendly technique for high-purity hydrogen production. However, the sluggish dynamics of its two half-reactions, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), are tough challenges impeding the practical application of this technology. In these years, external field-assisted HER and OER have attracted extensive research interests. Herein, the effects of various fields, including electric field, magnetic field, strain, and light, on electrocatalytic HER and OER are systematically discussed. The focus is how to integrate the external fields with the electrocatalytic systems and the fundamentals of field promoted HER/OER activities. In the end, the key challenges facing this rapidly progressing research field are highlighted and possible strategies addressing them are indicated.									59	2	0	0	3	0	60			2366-9608			WOS:000564844900001

For this purpose Ni-Mo-Fe as a bifunctional electrocatalyst was synthesized by one-step electrodeposition. From this electrocatalyst with optimal composition and current density, a small overpotential of 65, 161 mV for delivering 10, 100 mA/cm(2) on HER in alkaline media was achieved. As-fabricated electrode exhibited 344,408 mV for delivering 10, 100 mA/cm(2) in OER. Furthermore, this electrocatalyst shows high stability and negligible degradation in overpotential for HER and OER under long term stability tests in alkaline media. The notable function of As-fabricated Ni-Mo-Fe is due to the synergism effect between Ni, Mo, and Fe element and binder-free structure. Owing to the high-performance and high-stability of Ni-Mo-Fe electrocatalyst under Hydrogen and Oxygen evolution reactions is a candidate for industrial uses in the alkaline electrolyzer.

Surface chemical etching of CuCo-oxide (CCO) introduced oxygen vacancies and thus increased electrical conductivity to promote oxygen generation. During practical applicability testing, when CE-CCO was used as the anode of an anion-exchange membrane water electrolyzer, enhanced oxygen evolution performance was observed (current density = 1390 mA/cm(2) at 1.8 V-cell), which, among other reactions, was ascribed to the easy removal of O-2 from the aerophobic electrode surface. In addition to featuring low mass transfer resistance even at high current density with substantial gas generation, the CE-CCO electrode featured remarkable durability, exhibiting stable performance over 3600 h under the conditions of continuous O-2 evolution. Thus, this work shows that the performance of electrodeposited oxide catalysts can be enhanced by introducing oxygen vacancies, while the energy conversion efficiency of the corresponding water electrolysis systems can be increased by lowering mass transfer resistance via efficient gas removal and reactant supply.									42	1	0	0	4	0	43			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000564571400010

From the detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses, the electrocatalytically active Co9S8 nanoparticles were clearly obtained and combined with the thin sulfur doped carbon layers. Electrochemical data showed that Co9S8/S-C had a good activity and long-term stability in catalyzing oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolyte, even better than the traditional RuO2 electrocatalyst. The excellent electrocatalytic activity of Co9S8/S-C was mainly attributed to the synergistic effect between the Co9S8 catalyst which contributed to the oxygen evolution reaction and the sulfur doped carbon layer which facilitated the adsorption of reactants, prevented the Co9S8 particles from aggregating and served as the electrically conductive binder between each component.									43	5	0	0	1	0	45			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000390604600052	27797428

However, the synergistic interaction of the heteroatom and defect still needs further investigations. Herein, we demonstrated an oxygen vacancy-rich vanadium-doped Co3O4 (V-O-v-Co3O4), fabricated by V-ion implantation, could be used for high-efficient OER catalysis. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the charge density of Co atom increased, and the reaction barrier of reaction pathway from O* to HOO* decreased. V-O-v-Co3O4 catalyst shows a low overpotential of 329 mV to maintain current density of 10 mA.cm(-2), and a small Tafel slope of 74.5 mV.dec(-1).

The oxidative etching and cation exchange caused by Fe-incorporating induce the change of morphology and the formation of Ni3+, thus increase the specific surface area and expose more active sites, finally greatly enhance the electrocatalytic OER performance.

However, the practical application of rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries has been limited by poor cycle performance, especially the side reactions that lower the oxygen reaction efficiency at the positive electrode. The present study demonstrated that when the triethylphosphate-based electrolyte contains lithium nitrate and triethylphosphate forms a solvated complex by coordinating with Li ions, the O-2 evolution rate could reach almost 100 % of that of the ideal two-electron reaction (O-2/e(-) = 0.5) during the most part of the charging process, with the total oxygen evolution yield exceeding 90 %.

We show that the combination of catalyst materials containing stable ORR active sites with those containing stable OER active sites may result in a stable ORR/OER catalyst if each of the active components can satisfy the current demand of their respective reaction. We compare the ORR/OER performances of oxides of Mn (stable ORR active sites), Fe (stable OER active sites), and bimetallic Mn0.5Fe0.5 (reversible ORR/OER catalyst) supported on oxidized multi-walled carbon nanotubes.

Here we report high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts of transition metal nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (M/N-CNTs, M = Fe, Co, and Ni). The optimized Co/N-CNT hybrid shows the highest efficient bifunctional catalytic activity and excellent stability towards both the ORR and OER.

Some discrepancies of the conventional, "acidic field-assisted dissolution" mechanism, responsible for PAA formation, were experimentally analyzed. The anodization of aluminum under different conditions, such as three different electrolytes, in low vacuum, in air and at a high pressure, was performed. The microstructures of the PAA membranes prepared under different conditions were characterized with scanning electron microscopy. The preliminary results show that the impact of the oxygen evolution reaction is clearly much more important than that of the acidic field-assisted dissolution on PAA formation by electrochemical reaction			分析了多孔阳极氧化铝(PAA)形成过程中,传统"酸性场致溶解"的电化学反应及其局限性. 同时,为验证氧气析出反应对PAA孔道产生和发展的影响,深入探讨PAA的形成机理,分别对比了在真空、高气压条件下,铝在三种电解液中的阳极氧化过程. 用扫描电子显微镜表征了各种条件下PAA的微观结构,结果表明PAA孔道形成的本质原因是氧气析出反应,而非酸性场致溶解反应						1	3	0		0	0	3			1672-7126			CSCD:4124722

The conventional noble metal-based electrocatalysts cannot satisfy the demand of large-scale manufacturing due to their high-price and scarce reserves in the earth. Therefore, rational designing of transition metal-based materials to endow high activity, selectivity, stability, and low cost has been regarded as an alternative of noble metal-based materials. Here, recent effective and facile strategies to rationally design transition metal-based electrocatalysts, such as increasing the number active sties, improving the utilization of active sites (atomic-scale catalysts), modulating the electron configurations, as well as controlling the lattice facets, for oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and CO2 reduction reaction, are summarized. It is believed that based on the understanding of fundamental design principles, well-designed non-noble metal and even metal free electrocatalysts would further make the electrochemical energy conversion and storage great promise in the future.									202	12	0	0	7	0	204			2366-9608			WOS:000454991000009

An obstacle that badly impedes the design of efficient OER catalysts is the weak understanding of the oxygen intermediates. Because of the aqueous reaction environment of OER, direct detection of oxygen intermediates is very challenging. Herein, we develop a general method for operando probing OER intermediates under real working conditions. We proved that the electrochemically generated oxygen intermediates of OER, e. g., OH*, are electrophiles, which could be probed by reaction with nucleophiles such as alcohol molecules. The exceptional generality of this method is demonstrated in different reaction mediums (alkaline and acid) and on various types of materials (oxides and hydroxides). The new insights of the surface chemistry on OER catalysts from the experimental approach will benefit the design of new catalysts to reduce the cost of hydrogen production.									131	7	0	0	11	0	133			2542-4351			WOS:000472067900016

However, the lack of protons in alkaline conditions limits the rate of ORR. Herein, an activating water strategy is proposed to promote oxygen electrocatalytic activity by enhancing the proton production from water dissociation. FeP nanoparticles (NPs) are coupled on N-doped wood-derived catalytically active carbon (FeP-NWCC) to associate bifunctional active sites. In alkaline, FeP-NWCC possesses outstanding catalytic activities toward ORR (E-1/2 = 0.86 V) and Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (overpotential is 310 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)). The liquid ZABs assembled by FeP-NWCC deliver superior peak power density (144 mW cm(-2)) and cycle stability (over 450 h). The quasi-solid-state ZABs based on FeP-NWCC also display excellent performances. Theoretical calculation illustrates that the superb bifunctional performance of FeP-NWCC results from the elevated dissociation efficiency of water via FeP NPs to assist the oxygen catalytic process. The strategy of activating water provides a new perspective for the design of ORR/OER bifunctional catalysts. This work is a model for the application of forest biomass.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000829206500001	35871557

Among numerous inorganic materials, CeO2-based electrocatalysts with flexible transform between Ce3+ and Ce4+ states and the abundant oxygen vacancies become one of the most promising candidates. This review summarizes the recent development in the synthetic strategy of CeO2-based nanomaterials and their applications in several representative electrochemical reactions, such as hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen oxidation reaction, organic molecular oxidation reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, N2 reduction reaction and CO2 reduction reaction in liquid-phase electrolyte. By virtue of advanced characterization techniques and computational studies based on density functional theory (DFT), the detailed effects of CeO2 on these reactions and the specific mechanism to improve the catalytic efficiency are discussed and analyzed as well. In parallel, some strategies and procedure are proposed for the design and synthesis of CeO2-based electrocatalysts to achieve better catalytic performance. Finally, several challenges and perspectives in this emerging research area are proposed. To some extent, we believe that this review is also helpful for designing other high catalytic performance materials toward energy conversion and storage.

Transition metal borides have recently attracted increasing attention as promising catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction. Herein, ultrathin Ni-Co-B nanosheets have been vertically aligned on reduced graphene oxide as exceptionally efficient oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst for the first time. Controlled experiments indicate the critical role of reduced graphene oxide in guiding the formation of Ni-Co-B nanosheet. The catalyst affords a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotential of 280 mV, which is better than most of metal boride catalysts reported to date. Stable current output is maintained at 20 mA cm(-2) for at least 60 h. We expect this work will arouse the interests on design of compositing two-dimensional metal borides with graphene, C3N4, and metal dichalcogenides towards applications in energy storage and conversion, electrocatalysis, and sensing.

J	Zhang, Jie; Zhang, Gehong; Zhang, Jing								Organic/inorganic nitride heterostructure for efficient photocatalytic oxygen evolution								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				475				256	263		10.1016/j.apsusc.2018.12.240				MAY 1 2019	2019	Given the four-electron water oxidation reaction as the rate-limiting step for water splitting, highly efficient photocatalysts for oxygen evolution have been receiving increasing research attentions. In this study, an organic/inorganic g-C3N4/CoN nitride heterostructure was developed by a facile precipitation-nitridation two-step process. With the CoN loading amounts optimized, the obtained g-C3N4/CoN composite achieves more than 4-fold increase in photocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution, as compared to the pristine g-C3N4, with a highest oxygen evolution rate reaching 607.2 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) under visible light (lambda > 420 nm). It was demonstrated that the formed g-C3N4/CoN heterostructure could promote the interfacial charge carrier separation and the loaded CoN acting as an effective cocatalyst could accelerate the water oxidation reaction kinetics, which synergistically contributes to the great enhancement in photocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution. Interestingly, by physically mixing g-C3N4/CoN and g-C3N4/Ni, acting as oxygen and hydrogen production photocatalysts, respectively, the obtained composite could stably produce oxygen and hydrogen in the stoichiometric ratio from pure water under visible light (lambda > 420 nm). Although the photocatalytic overall water splitting activity is still very low, this study demonstrates a facile and promising approach to develop visible-light active photocatalysts for simultaneous hydrogen and oxygen production from water, from the perspective of surface modification and bifunctional cocatalyst loading.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000458482100029

Unfortunately, highly positive electrochemical potentials take place at the positive electrode (air electrode) especially during the oxygen evolution reaction. This is a highly corrosive condition and, thus, more stable catalysts are required. In the present work, titanium suboxides (TinO2-1) have been studied as palladium catalyst support for the air electrode of metal-air batteries. The performance of Pd/TinO2n-1 towards both the oxygen reduction and the oxygen evolution reactions in alkaline media was analysed. Besides, the stability of the catalysts was assessed by subjecting them to accelerated stress tests. These catalysts were compared to a Pd catalyst supported on a conventional carbon black (Vulcan). Pd/TinO2n-1 showed a suitable activity as bifunctional catalyst, comparable to Pd/Vulcan, particularly for the ORR. Besides, it showed a higher performance with time than the carbonaceous support-based catalyst when subjected to harsh electrochemical conditions (1.8 V vs. RHE for 8 h). This indicates a more suitable stability for application in metal-air batteries. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The oxygen evolution process can be directly visualized from the development of oxygen nanobubbles around nanocatalysts. The high spatial and temporal resolution further enables us to unravel the real-time formation of a surface layer on Mn2O3, whose thickness oscillation reflects a partially reversible surface restructuring relevant to OER catalysis. Ex situ atomic-resolution TEM on the residual surface layer after OER reveals its amorphous nature with reduced Mn valence and oxygen coordination. Besides shedding light on the dynamic OER catalysis, our results also demonstrate a powerful strategy combining in situ and ex situ TEM for investigating various chemical reaction mechanisms in liquid.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000691792400038	34369791

Nickel cobalt oxides were synthesized in a sol-gel process with different precursors, namely nitrate, sulfate, and chloride. Structural analyses show that the structures have mesoporous morphologies and indicate the formation of nickel cobalt oxide spinel structures with a size ranging from 35 to 65 nm. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties differ depending on the nature of the selected precursors, including the materials' morphology and the chemical composition. Electrocatalytic investigations demonstrate that the catalytic activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) could be modulated between two- and four-electron pathways, depending on the precursors used. The Cl-NiCoO sample displays a selective two-electron reduction of O-2, with H(2)O(2)production higher than 90 %.

Metal selenides are attractive candidates for electrocatalytic water oxidation because they provide suitable surface-active sites for the reaction. Herein, we report less explored hexagonal cobalt selenide (CoSe) preparation for oxygen evolution reaction through the facile and environmentally benign one-step hydrothermal method. Reaction conditions were precisely tailored to develop highly crystalline and porous dendrimeric architectures of CoSe. Owing to its exclusive porous and dendrimeric crystalline network and large electrochemical surface area, the superior CoSe electrocatalyst (that is 16H) showed excellent electrochemical activity with remarkably low overpotential (250 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and very high current density (570 mA cm(-2)) in a small potential window. The Tafel slope of 16H sample was 56 mV dec(-1), indicating the faster kinetics at the catalyst surfaces. Moreover, it also showed excellent stability under harsh oxidative conditions in a 24-hour long stability test experiment.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000801971400003

Perspectives in biology and medicine				65	3			415	425		10.1353/pbm.2022.0034				2022	2022	The evolution of self-replicating biological species required the prebiotic evolution of fundamental chemical compounds that facilitate critical redox reactions, including chiefly the oxidation of water, the reduction of molecular oxygen, and redox transitions of partially reduced forms of oxygen (reactive oxygen species). The fundamental catalysts for these reactions are porphyrins. Chemically versatile, photoreactive, and redox-active, porphyrins (or their primary precursor, porphin) are believed to have evolved prebiotically in an enthalpically feasible series of reactions. Found throughout biological kingdoms, porphyrins were incorporated in apoproteins in biological evolution and adapted to the specific redox needs of the organisms in which they were active, including photosynthesis, reactive oxygen species metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation. They did so by virtue of differing transition metal chelates and tetrapyrrole side chains. This article reviews the prebiotic and biotic evolution of porphyrins and porphyrin-bearing apoproteins and suggests that porphyrins' history in evolution reflects a repurposing of molecular motifs as an efficient mechanism for adaptation to a changing redox environment.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1529-8795		MEDLINE:36093774	36093774

It is a low electricity consumption process as nickel dissolution potential is much lower than oxygen evolution reaction occurring at inert electrode during anodic process. The electrolytic efficiency for this process was close to 100%. The sample obtained in this process is highly crystalline beta-nickel hydroxide conformed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The discharge capacity determination shows that the nickel hydroxide prepared by the above method has a higher discharge capacity which is suitable to battery industries.

Herein, we designed the bulk preparation of heteroatom-doped nanoporous carbon catalysts using widely available and recyclable Pueraria lobata powder as the carbon source. The typical product was N, P and Fe Tri-doped nano-porous carbon (N,P,Fe-NPC) with high surface area (BET surface area of 776.68 m(2) g(-1) and electrochemical surface area of 55.0 mF cm(-2)). The typical N,P,Fe-NPC sample simultaneously exhibited high activities for oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions. Because of the high surface area and the tri-doping of N, P and Fe elements, the prepared material may have applications in other fields such as gas uptake, sensors, sewage treatment, and supercapacitors. The suggested approach is low-cost, simple and readily scalable.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2046-2069			WOS:000440243600035	35539201

In this work, we present a simple procedure based on pyrolysis of polybenzoxazine/metal metalloid nanoparticles composites into efficient bifunctional oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. This procedure generates nitrogen-doped carbon with embedded metal metalloid nanoparticles exhibiting high activity towards both, oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution, in 0.1 M KOH with a roundtrip voltage of as low as 0.81 V. Koutecky-Levich analysis coupled with scanning electrochemical microscopy reveals that oxygen is preferentially reduced in a 4e(-) transfer pathway to hydroxide rather than to hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, the polybenzoxazine derived carbon matrix allows for stable catalyst fixation on the electrode surface, resulting in unattenuated activity during continuous alternate polarisation between oxygen evolution at 10 mA cm(-2) and oxygen reduction at -1.0 mA cm(-2).

Fundamentally, the OER process is governed by the chemical reactivity of oxygen intermediates. Here, we demonstrate an effective approach to regulate the oxygen reactivity through the double-exchange interaction (DEI) towards OER activity improvement, using Ti-substituted pyrochlore ruthenate Y2Ru2-xTixO7 as model catalyst. We unveil that DEI-induced electron hopping in asymmetric Ru-O-Ti backbone enables the charge depletion in Ru active center to tune on the oxygen activation by ligand hole introduction. In addition, the ferromagnetic nature of DEI constructs a spin-selected channel for charge transport to govern the spin state in oxygen intermediates. Such comprehensive manipulation of oxygen reactivity substantially facilitates the nucleophilic attack process during O-O coupling as rate-determining step, lowering the energy barrier to improve the intrinsic OER activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2567-3173		WOS:000855738000001

However, developing a harmless defect engineering strategy based on mild conditions to realize such an enhancement remains a challenge. Here, ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets with abundant oxygen vacancies were prepared through a simple two-step method comprising a hydrothermal process and pre-oxidation to study the catalytic activity of the nanosheets toward OER. The ultrathin sheet structure and the Co3O4 nanosheets surface provide abundant active sites. The oxygen vacancy not only improves the catalyst activity, but also improves the electron transfer efficiency. These advantages make ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets with abundant oxygen vacancies an excellent electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution. In an alkaline medium, ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets exhibited excellent OER catalytic activity, with a small overpotential (367 mV for 10 mA/cm(2)) and faster reaction kinetics (65 mV/dec). Moreover, the electrocatalyst still maintained 68% of its original catalytic activity after 24 h operation.

Transition metal phosphides are emerging as promising catalyst candidates because of their superb activity and low cost. Herein, a novel metal phosphonate-derived cobalt/nickel phosphide@ N-doped carbon hybrid was developed by a carbothermal reduction of cobalt/nickel phosphonate hybrids with different Co/Ni molar ratios. The metal phosphonate derivation method achieved an intimately coupled interaction between metal phosphides and a heteroatom-doped carbon substrate. The resultant Co2P/Ni3P@NC-0.2 enables an impressive electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction activity, comparable with those of state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts in terms of onset potential (0.88 V), 4e(-) selectivity, methanol tolerance, and long-term durability. Moreover, remarkable oxygen evolution reaction activity was also observed in alkaline conditions. The high activity is ascribed to the N-doping, abundant accessible catalytic active sites, and the synergistic effect among the components.

Here, we report constituent-tunable metal-phthalocyanine-based covalent organic polymers as self-sacrificial precursors for fabrication of mono-(Fe or Ni) and bi-metallic (Fe-Ni) heteroatoms/carbon catalysts toward both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As a result, the as-prepared FeNi-COP-800 exhibits an efficient ORR performance with a half-potential of 0.80 V as well as an IrO2-like OER activity with a potential of 1.63 V at 10 mA cm(-2), which surpass those of monometallic Fe-COP-800 and Ni-COP-800. Moreover, a zinc-air flow battery using FeNi-COP-800 catalyst not only shows a higher power density than the battery using Pt/C-IrO2/C but also displays superior stability with 2.90% potential loss after 85 cycles in 175 h of practical operation. Accordingly, this work provides a facile but efficient approach in molecular incorporation of desired constituents to obtain bi/multi-active sites in a single catalyst for various catalytic roles, including, but not limited to, oxygen reduction, hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution.									46	2	0	0	3	0	47			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000453616800021

Two electrodes prepared with two different IrO2 compositions were analysed in Na2SO4 electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry, steady state polarization curves, impedance spectroscopy and open circuit potential were performed to investigate the performance and stability of these electrocatalysts. It has found that the surface electrochemistry of Ti/IrO2-SnO2 anodes are governed by the Ir(III)/Ir(IV) couple. The impedance spectroscopy investigation permitted to propose an equivalent circuit to describe the modifications occurred in different potentials during oxygen evolution reaction. The same equivalent circuit was found to describe both electrodes. Moreover, the double layer capacitance and microstructure analysis reflected that the inner surface makes a large contribution to the electrochemically active surface area of Ti/IrO2-SnO2 anodes. It was found that the stability and the electrocatalytic activity mainly depend on changes in the IrO2 composition of the electrode and its morphology during oxygen evolution reaction.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			0250-4707	0973-7669		WOS:000378899300026

J	Exner, Kai S.								Boosting the Stability of RuO2 in the Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction by Tuning Oxygen-Vacancy Formation Energies: A Viable Approach Beyond Noble-Metal Catalysts?								CHEMELECTROCHEM				8	1			46	48		10.1002/celc.202001465		DEC 2020		JAN 4 2021	2021	RuO2 belongs to the most active electrode materials for the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) within the electrochemical water splitting, such as those encountered in acidic proton-exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. Despite its large activity, RuO2 faces severe stability issues under the harsh anodic operation conditions. Now, a new strategy has been reported to overcome this bottleneck by tuning the free-formation energy of oxygen vacancies, which can be achieved by the co-doping of W and Er into the RuO2 lattice. The resulting W0.2Er0.1Ru0.7O2-delta electrocatalyst is stable long term in acid and, additionally, reveals remarkable OER activity, about 30 times higher than that of commercial RuO2. The notion of tuning the oxygen-vacancy formation energy could be a valuable starting point for the development of non-noble electrocatalysts for the acidic OER with applications in PEM electrolyzers.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2196-0216			WOS:000598885900001

Herein, we report the rational design and realization of a tri-functional electrocatalyst featuring Co/CoP embedded in a hairy nitrogen-doped carbon polyhedral (Co/CoP-HNC) derived from common metal organic frameworks (MOFs). The components of Co, CoP, and hairy nitrogen-doped carbon in the catalyst respectively render catalytic activity, high electrochemical surface area, and electronic conductivity. The synergy of the tailored Co/CoP-HNC catalyst provides high activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The catalytic performance and assembly feasibility are further demonstrated in overall water splitting and Zn-air battery tests, and both revealed high efficiency and long durability of the proposed electrocatalyst.									142	10	0	0	5	0	143			2051-6347	2051-6355		WOS:000419151900013

Herein, a novel porous cobalt-porphyrin-based covalent organic polymer (CoCOP) is fabricated through the Schiff-base condensation reaction, which is used as a difunctional electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The CoCOP possesses a high surface area and strong synergistic effect between the cobalt-porphyrins and the C=N groups, resulting in efficient HER and OER performances. The CoCOP required relatively low overpotentials for both HER (121 mV to reach 1.0 mA cm(-2) and 310 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) ) and OER (166 mV to reach 1.0 mA cm(-2) and 350 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) ) in alkaline media. This work may provide a new idea for the design of non-noble metal-based coordination polymers with excellent structure and high electrocatalytic performance. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, the development of technology for clean-energy production has become the major research priority worldwide. The globalization of advanced energy conversion technologies like rechargeable metal-air batteries, regenerated fuel cells, and water-splitting devices has been majorly benefitted by the development of apposite catalytic materials that can proficiently carry out the pertinent electrochemical processes like oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and water hydrolysis. Despite a handful of superbly performing commercial catalysts, the high cost and low electrochemical stability of precursors have consistently discouraged their long-term viability. As a promising substitute of conventional platinum-, palladium-, iridium-, gold-, silver-, and ruthenium-based catalysts, various transition-metal (TM) ions (for example, Fe, Co, Mo, Ni, V, Cu, etc.) have been exploited to develop advanced electroactive materials to outperform the state-of-the-art catalytic properties. Among these TMs, nickel has emerged as one of the most hopeful constituents due to its exciting electronic properties and anticipated synergistic effect to dramatically alter surface properties of materials to favor electrocatalysis. This review article will broadly confer about recent reports on nickel-based nanoarchitectured materials and their applications toward ORR, OER, HER, and whole water splitting. On the basis of these applications and properties of nickel derivatives, a futuristic outlook of these materials has also been presented.									593	33	0	0	22	0	596			2155-5435			WOS:000412795700091

In this study, the cation of the Co site is substituted by Mn in LaCoO3, and samples with the composition LaMnxCo(1-x)O(3) (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0) are prepared. Electrocatalytic test results show that the electrocatalytic activities of the samples depend on the Mn concentration, and LaMn0.4Co0.6O3 simultaneously exhibits the best OER/ORR performance and stability. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results show that the introduction of Mn can significantly increase the content of highly active Mn4+ and Co3+. This result and the increased electrical conductivity evidenced by both, first-principles calculations and charge transfer resistance results, can explain the optimization of the oxygen catalytic activities.

Because the OER is a slow reaction, it needs to be facilitated by (photo)electro-catalysts. To develop such catalysts, advances in the mechanistic understanding of the OER are critical. In this opinion, we focus on a key aspect of the OER, namely, how the accumulation of oxidative charge ('holes') on the surface of a catalyst triggers O - O bond formation. We discuss recent advances in understanding the factors that drive surface hole formation at specific sites.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2451-9103			WOS:000819856600005

In this work, a modified gel methodology has been used to obtain nanocomposites of perovskite CoTiO3 and N-doped reduced graphene oxide (NrGO). Moreover, the influence of the annealing extent in the synthesis has been studied. The composites show higher activity in oxygen evolution and reduction reactions in alkaline environment compared to sole ilmenite, which is related to a strong interaction between cobalt titanate and NrGO carbon matrix. The annealing duration appears as a key variable to modulate the physicochemical properties and the electrochemical behavior. The composite prepared at the largest duration (3 h) exhibit enhanced bifunctional properties for ORR and OER, with onset potentials of 0.93 V and 1.53 V vs. RHE respectively, which is mainly attributed to higher concentration of nitrogen, larger extent of defects and/or the presence of more oxidized Co species in the nanocomposite.

In this paper, novel amorphous polymetallic doped CeO2 particles were prepared for an electrochemical catalyst via homogeneous phase precipitation at room temperature. Metal ions can be easily embedded into the oxygen vacancies formed by CeO2, and the the electron transport capacity of the CeO2/NiFeCo electrocatalyst is improved owing to the increase in active sites. In addition, the amorphous CeO2/NiFeCo composite material is in a metastable state and will transform into different active states in a reducing or oxidizing environment. Furthermore, the amorphous material drives oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM), while LOM can effectively bypass the adsorption of strongly related intermediates in the adsorbate release mechanism, thus promoting OER procedure in a timely manner. As a result, CeO2/NiFeCo exhibits a lower oxygen evolution overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density, which shows a predatorily competitive advantage compared with commercially available RuO2 and the reported catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000662672900001	33836518

To date, few studies have reported that the Earth-abundant pyrite FeS2 is catalytically active for hydrogen evolution reaction, while there is no study on the oxygen evolution reaction and overall water splitting reaction using pyrite FeS2 as an electrocatalyst. Here, we offer a facile hydrothermal approach for the synthesis of FeS2 nanoparticles by the reduction of FeCl(3)6H(2)O with C(5)H(10)NS(2)Na3H(2)O. The FeS2/C nanoparticles on Ni foam (NF) deliver 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 240 mV towards the oxygen evolution reaction, which is lower than that of IrO2. It requires 202 mV to drive the hydrogen evolution reaction to reach 10 mA cm(-2), while long-term durability and faster charge-transfer kinetics confirm the good hydrogen evolution reaction performance on FeS2/C/Ni foam. Moreover, the pyrite FeS2/C/nanoparticles on Ni foam are assembled as an anode and cathode in a two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer and show good overall water splitting efficiency with 1.72 V at 10 mA cm(-2).									42	1	0	0	4	0	42			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000449696200013	30280744

We attribute the trivalent charge transfer state to be the active state for the oxygen evolution reaction.

However, the nature of the active site in nickel iron oxide is heavily debated. Here we report direct spectroscopic evidence for the different active sites in Fe-free and Fe-containing Ni oxides. Ultrathin layered double hydroxides (LDHs) were used as defined samples of metal oxide catalysts, and O-18-labeling experiments in combination with in situ Raman spectroscopy were employed to probe the role of lattice oxygen as well as an active oxygen species, NiOO-, in the catalysts. Our data show that lattice oxygen is involved in the OER for Ni and NiCo LDHs, but not for NiFe and NiCoFe LDHs. Moreover, NiOO- is a precursor to oxygen for Ni and NiCo LDHs, but not for NiFe and NiCoFe LDHs. These data indicate that bulk Ni sites in Ni and NiCo oxides are active and evolve oxygen via a NiOO- precursor. Fe incorporation not only dramatically increases the activity, but also changes the nature of the active sites.									142	5	0	0	15	0	142			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000476452700043	31106463

Here, a trimetallic CoNiFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH) hollow superstructure grown on carbon cloth is ingeniously fabricated through an aging and etching-coprecipitating method. Remarkably, electron cloud density of active sites and adsorption for reaction intermediate are optimized by the strong electronic coupling effect and the abundant oxygen vacancies, which can endow catalysts with marvelous intrinsic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As a consequence, the trimetallic CoNiFe-LDH catalyst requires low overpotentials toward HER (143 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and OER (219 mV at 20 mA cm(-2)) in 1.0 M KOH, enabling an alkaline electrolyzer to deliver a low cell voltage of 1.56 V at 10 mA cm(-2) that are superior to most reported LDH catalysts. This work reports a high activity bifunctional OER/HER electrocatalysts, which may open numerous opportunities to the development of trimetallic LDH catalysts in hydrogen production.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000779916800004

In this study, amorphous Ni-Co-P coatings are applied on nickel nanocones array using the cyclic voltammetry electrodeposition method in different cycles and nickel-to-cobalt ratios. The electrocatalytic activities of the as-fabricated electrodes are studied for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline and neutral solution. The three-dimensional nickel nanocones expose more active surface area for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Binder-free Ni-Co-P@nickel nanocones electrode exhibits superior hydrogen evolution reaction catalytic activity in the alkaline solution, which requires only 51 and 110 mV for delivering 10 and 100 mAcm(-2), respectively. Also, this electrode exhibits low oxygen evolution reaction overpotential of 221 mV and 254 mV at 10 and 100 mAcm(-2), respectively. The fabricated electrode is able to sustain the current density of 100 mAcm(-2) with negligible degradation in overpotential which shows remarkable electrochemical stability. Moreover, this active and stable bifunctional electrocatalyst is used for full water splitting, able to deliver the current density of 10 mAcm(-2) in 1.53 V. Also, the fabricated electrode represented favorable behaviors as electrocatalyst for both HER and OER in neutral solution.									80	5	0	0	2	0	81			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000473118100019

This study reports a novel promoter based on ceria in situ growth on cerium-nitrogencarbon (CeO2@CeNC) for an oxygen evolution electrocatalyst. Composited with NiFe-LDH (optimal mass ratio of layer double hydroxide (LDH) and CeO2@CeNC is 2), the hybrid material (NiFe-LDH/CeO2@CeNC) exhibits excellent activity for oxygen evolution superior to those of most nickel-based catalysts and commercial Ir/C (20%) benchmark, achieving current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 235 and 430 mV, respectively.

Generally, molecular oxygen should be pre-eliminated in the hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) in order to avoid the reverse hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). Here, we report a highly efficient HER from a formaldehyde/water mixture using MgO supported Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs/MgO) as the catalyst and molecular oxygen as a promoter. The HER rate depends almost linearly on the oxygen partial pressure, and the optimal turnover frequency (TOF) of the silver catalyst exceeds 6,600 h(-1). Based on the experimental and theoretical results, a surface stabilized MgO/Ag-(OOH)-O-center dot complex is suggested to be the main catalytically active species for the HER.									45	2	0	0	5	0	46			2155-5435			WOS:000393539200064

The sluggish reaction kinetics in the related devices is one of the major obstacles for them to realize practical applications. More efforts should be devoted to searching for high-efficiency electrocatalysts and enhancing the electrocatalytic performance. 3D graphene macrostructures (3D GMs) are one kind of porous crystalline materials with 3D structures at both micro- and macro-scale. The unique structure can achieve large accessible surface area, expose many active sites, promote fast mass/electron transport, and provide wide room for further functional modification. All these features make them promising candidates for electrocatalysis. In this review, the authors focus on the latest progress of 3D GMs for electrocatalysis. First, the preparation methods of 3D GMs are introduced followed by the strategies for functional modifications. Then, their electrocatalytic performances are discussed in detail including monofunctional and bifunctional electrocatalysis. The electrocatalytic processes involve oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Finally, the challenges and perspectives are presented to offer a guideline for the exploration of excellent 3D GM-based electrocatalysts.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000629922400001	33733582

Herein, a nanowire-like morphology CoO/NF electrode is synthesized using facile hydrothermal reaction and calcination treatment. The urea can regulate its morphology during the synthetic process of CoO/NF. Electrochemical studies reveal that the as-obtained CoO/NF exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance with overpotential of 307 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 72 mV dec(-1) for oxygen evolution reaction, and CoO/NF delivers current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of 224 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction. The results of the oxygen evolution reaction stability show that the overpotential of CoO/NF electrode is only increased by 4 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The two-electrode water splitting with CoO/NF electrodes as both anode and cathode needs a cell potential of 1.76 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2). Therefore, this simple method to prepare CoO/NF electrode can enhance the properties of electrocatalysts, which makes CoO/NF a promising material to replace noble metal-based catalysts.

The hybrid LSM@Co3O4 catalyst exhibits high catalytic activities for both ORR and OER (similar to 7 times, similar to 1.5 times, and similar to 1.6 times higher than LSM, Co3O4, and IrO2, respectively) in terms of onset potential and limiting current density. Moreover, with the LSM@Co3O4, the number of electrons transferred reaches four, indicating that the catalyst is effective in the reduction reaction of O-2 via a direct four-electron pathway. The study demonstrates that hybrid catalysts are a promising approach for oxygen electrocatalysts for renewable and sustainable energy devices.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				1420-3049		WOS:000611441300001	33429877

A large body of impedance data obtained as a function of scanned potential by running combined staircase cyclic voltammetry and FTEIS experiments led to systematic analysis on the electrode/electrolyte interface. The changes in solution resistances, film resistances as well as film capacitances, double layer capacitances, polarization resistances, and Warburg admittances observed during lead oxidation satisfactorily explain corresponding electrochemical reactions. Various electrode reaction kinetic parameters for oxidation of lead and oxygen evolution were obtained from the impedance data. The reaction mechanism is discussed based on the impedance data.

However, high price and sluggish kinetics catalysts prevent commercial applications. Generally, noble metals (e.g., iridium and ruthenium), which are expensive and unstable, have been used as catalysts for OER because of their high electrocatalytic activity. In this study, we report a high-performance OER catalyst with oxygen vacancies comprising NiO/Co3O4 nanohybrids. For OER, the NiO/Co3O4 heterostructure show good electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 330 mV. This is higher than those of NiO, Co3O4, and benchmark IrO2 candidates at current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the NiO/Co3O4 nanohybrids show long-term electrochemical stability for 10 h. The present research results show that NiO/Co3O4 heterostructure is an excellent electrocatalyst for OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0360-3199	1879-3487		WOS:000799077700001

In this work, Ni-Fe layered-double-hydroxide (LDH) nanocages with tunable shells are synthesized via a facile one-pot self-templating method. The number of shells can be precisely controlled by regulating the template etching at the interface. Benefiting from the double-shelled structure with large electroactive surface area and optimized chemical composition, the hierarchical Ni-Fe LDH nanocages exhibit appealing electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolyte.

Here, utilizing a complementary experimental and theoretical approach, pentavalent vanadium doping in the spinel oxides (i.e., Co3O4 and NiFe2O4) has been thoroughly investigated to engineer their surface structures for the enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. Specifically, when the optimal concentration of vanadium (ca. 7.7 at. %) is incorporated into Co3O4, the required overpotential to reach a certain j(GEOM) and j(ECSA) decreases dramatically for oxygen evolution reactions in alkaline media. Even after 30 h of chronopotentiometry, the required potential for V-doped Co3O4 just increases by 16.3 mV, being much lower than that of the undoped one. It is observed that the pentavalent vanadium doping introduces lattice distortions and defects on the surface, which in turn exposes more active sites for reactions. DFT calculations further reveal the rate-determining step changing from the step of *-O to *-OOH to the step of *-OH to *-O, while the corresponding energy barriers decrease from 1.73 to 1.57 eV accordingly after high-valent V doping. Moreover, the oxygen intermediate probing method using methanol as a probing reagent also demonstrates a stronger OH* adsorption on the surface after V doping. When vanadium doping is performed in the inverse spinel matrix of NiFe2O4, impressive performance enhancement in the oxygen evolution reaction is as well witnessed. All these results clearly illustrate that the V doping process can not only efficiently improve the electrochemical properties of spinel transition metal oxides but also provide new insights into the design of high-performance water oxidation electrocatalysts.									40	1	0	0	0	0	40			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000486360500044	31414595

Inspired by natural geodes, unique melamine nanogeodes are successfully synthesized using hydrothermal process. Sulfur-modified graphitic carbon nitride (S-modified g-CA(x)) electrocatalysts are obtained by annealing these melamine nanogeodes in situ with sulfur. The sulfur modification in the g-CNx structure leads to excellent oxygen evolution reaction activity by lowering the overpotential. Compared with the previously reported nonmetallic systems and well-established metallic catalysts, the S-modified g-CNx nanostructures show superior performance, requiring a lower overpotential (290 mV) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 120 mV dec(-1) with long-term durability of 91.2% retention for 18 h. These inexpensive, environmentally friendly, and easy-to-synthesize catalysts with extraordinary performance will have a high impact in the field of oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysis.									39	0	0	0	3	0	39			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000400452200007	28218825

A facile electrospinning technique is utilized for the first time to develop NiCoP nanoparticles encapsulated CNFs that are used as an energy storage system of supercapattery, and as an electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, and hydrogen evolution reaction in KOH electrolyte. Evolving from the inclusion of bimetallic phosphide nanoparticles, the NiCoP/CNF electrode unveils superior-specific capacitance (333 Fg(-1) at 2 Ag-1) and rate capability (87%). The fabricated supercapattery device offers a voltage of 1.6 V that supplies a remarkable energy density (36 Wh kg(-1)) along with an improved power density (4000 W kg(-1)) and unwavering cyclic stability (25 000 cycles). Meanwhile, the NiCoP/CNF electrode has simultaneously performed well as a multifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction at a half-wave potential of 0.82 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode and can attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a very low overpotential of 268 and 130 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively. Thus, the NiCoP/CNF with all its inimitable electrode properties has profoundly proved its proficiency at handling multifunctional challenges in terms of both storage and conversion.									190	12	0	0	4	0	192			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000438706700028

The oxygen evolution activities of manganese pyrophosphate compounds were examined in electrochemical and photochemical experiments. Electrocatalysis using calcium-manganese pyrophosphate exhibited good catalytic ability under neutral pH and an oxygen evolution reaction was driven with a small overpotential (eta < 100 mV). UV-vis diffuse reflectance measurements revealed that manganese pyrophosphates exhibit weak absorption in the visible light region while commonly used oxygen evolution catalysts exhibit intense absorption. Therefore, the efficient light absorption of a photocatalyst was retained even after surface modification with a manganese pyrophosphate, and photochemical oxygen evolution was achieved by using magnesium ferrite modified with manganese pyrophosphate nanoparticles under the illumination of visible light at wavelength of over 420 nm.

Therefore, it is essential to develop active oxygen evolution catalysts. In this context, we designed and synthesized a tungsten oxide catalyst with oxygen vacancies for photocatalytic oxygen evolution, which exhibited a higher oxygen evolution rate of 683 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) than that of pure WO3 (159 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)). Subsequent studies through transient absorption spectroscopy found that the oxygen vacancies can produce electron trapping states to inhibit the direct recombination of photogenerated carriers. Additionally, a Pt cocatalyst can promote electron trap states to participate in the reaction to improve the photocatalytic performance further. This work uses femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy to explain the photocatalytic oxygen evolution mechanism of inorganic materials and provides new insights into the design of high-efficiency water-splitting catalysts.									86	2	0	0	6	0	85			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000634914300026	33491294

From these it is shown that the traditional approach involving the use of the quasi-equilibrium assumption can fail to predict the correct electrode behaviour. Using these models, it is also shown that identical polarisation curves can be generated from multiple sets of kinetic parameters. Clearly, a steady-state polarisation curve is insufficient to completely characterize an electrodes kinetics. However, by simulating dynamic electrode response (e.g. a potential step experiment), differences in behaviour between the sets of kinetic parameters can be observed.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1938-5862			INSPEC:18500744

We report such synergic catalysis involving organic xanthylium-based catalyst, Xan(2+), and oxides formed on the electrode surface. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was observed on some working electrodes (gold, platinum, glassy carbon, boron-doped diamond), while others (titanium and fluorine-doped tin oxide) exhibited no OER activity. On the basis of experimental data and supported by calculations, we propose a mechanism in which oxidized Xan(2+) activates electrode toward the rate-determining O-O bond formation. In light of our findings, efficient OER electrocatalysis can be achieved using materials that strongly bind oxygen species and electron deficient organic cations.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1944-8244			WOS:000442460400002	30063133

Multi-scale design of electrocatalysts from the atomic scale to device-scale is crucial to achieve optimal overall electrochemical performance in terms of activity, selectivity, and durability. Benefitting from their highly diverse and tunable structures and compositions, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising platforms to design and synthesize electrocatalysts at multiple scales for energy electrocatalysis. Herein, the fundamental principles and recent progress in multi-scale design of MOF-derived materials from the aspects of active sites, interfaces, pore structures, and morphologies are summarized. Moreover, precise control of these variables, to meet the requirements of specific energy-related reactions including oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), and N-2 reduction reaction is critically discussed. Furthermore, challenges and future research directions in multi-scale design and fabrication of MOF-derived electrocatalysts for real-world energy conversion applications are provided.									34	2	0	0	2	0	34			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000608227300001

However, efficient, cheap and stable catalysts are one of the bottlenecks for industrial application in water splitting. Herein, a facile one-step hydrothermal process was applied to fabricate Mn-doped nickel ferrite nanosheets (Mn-NiFe2O4) which shown a low overpotential of 200 mV at 50 mA.cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 47 mV.dec(-1), together with a prominent turnover frequency (TOF) value (0.14 s(-1)) and robust stability. The in-situ UV-vis spectroscopy unveiled the surface reconstruction to generate NiOOH as active sites during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The excellent electrocatalytic activity of Mn-NiFe2O4 is attributed to the vertically grown nanosheets for exposure more active sites, rich oxygen vacancies, and the hybridization between Ni 3d and O 2p orbitals caused by Mn doping. This work should provide a facile strategy by Mn-doping to simultaneously engineer oxygen vacancies and electronic structure for synergistically triggering oxygen evolution reaction.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000737722500001

One of the challenges for URFC's is the development of bifunctional electrocatalysts capable of carrying out efficiently the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), since those electrocatalysts that performs well the oxygen reduction have also poor oxygen evolution performance. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the efficiency of four different atomic composition electrocatalytic materials, based on Pt-Ru-Ir, to carry out the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. The studies of the performance for this material were made in a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC), using the linear voltammetry technique at 30, 60 and 80 degrees C in FC and WE mode. The Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) was prepared by the Hot-Spray technique for the oxygen electrode without using an electrocatalysts support; meanwhile the hydrogen electrode was prepared using the paste technique over the gas diffusion layer. The electrocatalyst loading was 3-5 mg.cm(-2) on the oxygen electrode and 0.5-1 mg Pt.cm(-2) on the hydrogen side.									31	1	0	0	2	1	32			1452-3981			WOS:000304413000069

A significant contributor to this high cost is the requirement for precious metals (namely Pt and Ir/Ru (oxides)) to catalyse the two main reactions involved in electrolysis: the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein we overview the current literature of non-precious metal HER and OER catalysts capable of efficient water splitting within a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyser, recording the activity and stability of each catalyst and allowing for direct comparison to be made. Additionally, we highlight the inapplicability of catalyst stability testing in many academic studies for commercial electrolyser applications and propose a universal stability-testing regime for HER and OER catalysts that more accurately mimics the conditions within an operating electrolyser.									29	2	0	0	1	0	30			1364-0321	1879-0690		WOS:000618803000003

ARCHIVES DES SCIENCES				53	3			195	205						DEC 2000	2000	In order to enhance the electrocatalytic activity of the lead dioxide towards the anodic oxygen transfer reaction, the anodic oxide layer formed in the lead dioxide potential region was modified by alloying lead with indium.First, XRD and SEM analyses have shown a weak influence of the indium on the structure and the morphology of the modified anodic oxide layer, suggesting that the doping element is introduced in the PbO2 lattice by the substitution of Pb+IV by In+III ion.Secondly, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was studied in neutral sulphate solution in terms of oxygen overvoltage and Tafel plot measurements. The influence of the indium content in the PbO2 layer towards the electrocatalysis of the anodic oxygen transfer reaction during the oxidation of DMSO chosen as model molecule was outlined. The enhancement of the anodic O-transfer reaction with the increase of the indium content is confirmed by the results of the phenol electrochemical oxidation. The improvement of the electrocatalytic effect can be ascribed to a better interaction between the active oxygen surface sites and the adsorbed organic molecules.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0252-9289			WOS:000166370700004

Understanding the structural evolution based on entire lifecycle is central to in-situ electrochemically construct high-performance OER electrocatalysts, but remaining highly challenging. In this work, aiming at representative CoFe (oxy)hydroxide electrocatalysts, we present a dechlorination-facilitated deprotonation process of CoFe hydroxide precatalyst containing lattice chlorine during OER, which enables the formation of a highly active CoFe oxyhydroxide. The resultant oxyhydroxide catalyst exhibits a remarkable OER activity with an overpotential of 271 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2. Operando Raman spectroscopy together with density functional theory calculations further demonstrate that the dechlorination process promotes the exposure of lattice oxygen sites that are directly involved in accelerating the OER.(C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

With the selective replacement of metal sites in the second coordination shell of Ru-cus, the free oxygen adsorption energy is reduced by about 0.8 and 1.0eV for Cr and Ir, respectively. The weakening of Ru-cus and oxygen-on-top (Ru-cus-O-ot) bonding results in a substantial decrease in the thermodynamic part of the reaction barrier (Gibbs free-energy loss) by 180meV for Cr and 150meV for Ir. The presented strategy is motivated by homogeneous metal catalysis where dedicated modifications of the ligands are able to tune the catalytic performance of the active metal center.									51	0	0	0	0	0	51			2196-0216			WOS:000354370900010

M is a transition element, and the stoichiometry MiXj is fixed at the solid/fluid interface by the reaction conditions. We illustrate this for a relevant set of reactions involved in solar energy and industrial applications such as oxygen evolution (X=O), oxygen reduction (X=O) and hydrogen evolution (X=H) in electrolysis, hydrodesulfurization of thiophene (X=S), methanation of CO (X=C), hydrogenation of aromatics and alkenes (X=C), selective oxidation of methane (X=O), and ammonia synthesis and decomposition (X=N). We propose a quantitative model to explain this unexpected connection: this key finding and its interpretation should accelerate in silico discovery of catalysts.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000524587800007

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous crystalline materials, exhibiting strong potential as precursors for obtaining outstanding electrocatalysts. MOF-based electrocatalysts, including MOFs and MOF-derived electrocatalysts, have become an increasingly important part of catalysts in the field of electrochemical water splitting, but their catalytic performance, especially their activity and stability, still have a lot of room for improvement. In this paper, the preparation strategy of MOF-based electrocatalysts and improvement methods of catalytic properties were reviewed, including morphology-controlled methods and composition-controlled methods. We also focused on the structure-property relationships, which determine the electrocatalytic activity for water splitting reactions. Finally, the challenges and development prospects were discussed for the MOF-based electrocatalysts, which might provide some insight for future applications in electrochemical water splitting.									28	3	0	0	0	0	28			2196-0216			WOS:000528950400001

The rational design of electrochemical catalysts replaces the traditional trial-and-error methods and thus promotes the R&D process. Identifying descriptors that link structure and activity as well as selectivity of catalysts is the key for rational design. In the past few decades, two types of descriptors including bulk- and surface-based have been developed to probe the structure-property relationships. Correlating the current descriptors to one another will promote the understanding of the underlying physics and chemistry, triggering further development of more universal descriptors for the future design of electrocatalysts. Herein, the current benchmark activity descriptors for oxygen electrocatalysis as well as their applications are reviewed. Particular attention is paid to circumventing the scaling relationship of oxygen-containing intermediates. For hybrid materials, multiple descriptors will show stronger predictive power by considering more factors such as interface reconstruction, confinement effect, multisite adsorption, etc. Machine learning and high-throughput simulations can thus be crucial in assisting the discovery of new multiple descriptors and reaction mechanisms.									82	2	0	0	1	0	82				2198-3844		WOS:000498645200001	31921555

Here, we control the aging time to prepare NixSey with different fractal structures as a bifunctional catalyst. An obtained sample with an aging time of 80 min shows outstanding electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) with an overpotential of 225 mV (eta@10 mA/cm(2)) and for oxygen evolution reactions (OER) with an overpotential of 309 mV (eta@50 mA/cm(2)). Moreover, to further improve catalytic activity, we doped Fe in NixSey to obtain the ternary nickel-based selenide, Fe0.2Ni0.8Se (FNSs). The HER activity of FNS increased two-fold at 10 mA/cm(2), and the overpotential of OER decreased to 255 mV at 50 mA/cm(2).

Herein, a highly durable and efficient carbide-based bifunctional catalyst consisting of ironmolybdenum carbide (Fe3Mo3C) and IrMn nanoalloys is demonstratred. This carbide is chemically stable in alkaline media and over the potential range of an air cathode. More importantly, Fe3Mo3C is very active for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media. Fe3Mo3C supported IrMn as a bifunictional catalysts exhibits superior catalytic performance than the state of the art ORR catalyst (Pt/C) and the oxygen evolution reaction catalyst (Ir/C). IrMn/Fe3Mo3C enables Znair batteries to achieve long-term cycling performance over 200 h with high efficiency.

In the alkaline electrolyte, g-C3N4/rGO showed lower overpotential and Tafel slope of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively, than the other 2D structured materials. The DFT calculation simulates the spontaneous electron transfer, low charge transfer resistance, and internal electric field of g-C3N4/rGO electrocatalysts. Especially, the internal electric field between the g-C3N4 and rGO is beneficial in solving the local pH reduction problem and electron transport.

Herein, we report a facile spontaneous redox reaction to grow cobalt-doped MnO2 ultrathin nanosheets in situ with abundant oxygen vacancies vertically aligned on cobalt/nitrogen co-functionalized carbon nanofibers (Co-MnO2 vertical bar O-V) as an efficient OER catalyst. It is confirmed that metallic cobalt plays a critical role in the formation of long and ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets during the redox reaction. Furthermore, the cobalt ions doped into MnO2 significantly enhance the catalytic activity of MnO2 nanosheets. Benefiting from the collaborative advantages of doping strategy, fast charge transfer kinetics and strong synergistic coupling effects, Co-MnO2 vertical bar O-V composites exhibit an excellent catalytic activity and a good durability for electrochemical water oxidation, reaching 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 279 mV. According to the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the enhanced catalytic activity mainly originates from a better conductivity and the decreased adsorption energy barrier of OH-on the O sites neighboring the doped Co and oxygen vacancies. Our findings suggest that the control over the structure and composition of the materials can achieve highly efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalysts.									130	10	0	0	8	0	130			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000450974700015

Accordingly, FM two-dimensional (2D) materials with unique physicochemical properties are expected to be promising oxygen-evolution catalysts; however, related research is yet to be reported due to their air-instabilities and low Curie temperatures (T-C). Here, based on the synthesis of 2D airstable FM Cr2Te3 nanosheets with a low T-C around 200 K, room-temperature ferromagnetism is achieved in Cr2Te3 by proximity to an anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) CrOOH, demonstrating the accomplishment of long-ranged FM ordering in Cr2Te3 because the magnetic proximity effect stems from paramagnetic (PM)/AFM heterostructure. Therefore, the OER performance can be permanently promoted (without applied magnetic field due to nonvolatile nature of spin) after magnetization. This work demonstrates that a representative PM/AFM 2D heterostructure, Cr2Te3/CrOOH, is expected to be a high-efficient magnetic heterostructure catalysts for oxygen-evolution.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000758046000045	34859672

However, the aggregation and poor conductivity are still obstacles for those eletrocatalysts. Herein, an effective method has been developed to overcome this problem by in-situ growth of ZIF-67 nanocrystals on the PAN fibers (ZIF-67/PAN) followed by the pyrolysis of ZIF-67/PAN fiber in 800 degrees C (ZIF-67/PAN-800). The obtained nanocomposite fibers showed that the isolated metal particles were anchored and linked up by carbon fibers, leading to elevated conductivity, preventing metal particles migration, and increasing stability. Such network structure provides facile pathways for efficient mass transport and shortens the electronic transmission path. As evidences, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic tests in this study both showed that ZIF-67/PAN-800 had an excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity in alkaline electrolyte. This strategy may give on a new way to synthesis electrocatalytic nanocomposite fibers. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

This is strongly related to the particle structure and surface chemistry. Here, a BiVO4 photocatalyst is synthesized by a co-precipitation method, in which urea is used as a pH modifier and bubble template growth agent. The synthesized BiVO4 particles show abundant oxygen vacancies and a higher {110} to {010} facet ratio than the case without a urea agent. The optimized BiVO4 samples exhibit very high catalytic activity, with the oxygen evolution rates of 680 mu mol h(-1) and 176 mu mol h(-1) with the sacrificial agents AgNO3 and Fe(NO3)(3), respectively, corresponding to the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 77.8% and 19.6% under 420 nm light irradiation. Interestingly, both results exceeded the theoretical oxygen evolution values which calculated from the reduction number of metal cations (Fe3+ -> Fe2+, Ag+ -> Ag). Based on a series of comparative experiments, we speculated that a new reaction might occur on the surface of BiVO4 in the solution during the photocatalytic oxygen evolution. It is expected that the proposed strategy and reaction mechanism could be extended to other photocatalysts' designs and applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000710482300001

The role of vacancy engineering in improving photo- and electrocatalytic activities of transition metal oxides (TMOs) has been widely reported. In particular, oxygen vacancy modulation on electrocatalysts of cobalt-based TMOs has seen a fresh spike of research work due to the substantial improvements they have shown towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Oxygen vacancy engineering is an effective scheme to quintessentially tune the electronic structure and charge transport, generate secondary active surface phases, and modify the surface adsorption/desorption behavior of reaction intermediates during water splitting. Based on contemporary efforts for inducing oxygen vacancies in a variety of cobalt oxide types, this work addresses facile and environmentally benign synthesis strategies, characterization techniques, and detailed insight into the intrinsic mechanistic modulation of electrocatalysts. It is our foresight that appropriate utilization of the principles discussed herein will aid researchers in rationally designing novel materials that can outperform noble metal-based electrocatalysts. Ultimately, future electrocatalysis implementation for selective seawater splitting is believed to depend on regulating the surface chemistry of active and stable TMOs.									39	0	0	0	1	0	39			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000595976400001	33053253

The electrode shows efficient and sustained electrochemical oxygen evolution at low overpotentials (360 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) against RHE, Tafel slope 126 mV dec(-1), faradaic efficiency (96 +/- 5)%) in alkaline aqueous solution (pH 13). Post-catalytic analyses show no mechanical or chemical degradation and no physical detachment of the microcrystals. The results provide a blueprint for the stable "wiring" of POM catalysts to commercial metal foam substrates, thus giving access to technologically relevant composite OER electrodes.									101	7	0	0	0	0	103			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000399384700005	28371059

Herein, NiO NPs with ultrasmall size (asymptotic to 2.1 nm) and rich oxygen vacancies (NiO-LFL) are prepared by laser fragmentation of bulk NiO NPs in water. The ultrasmall size of NPs enable more active sites to be exposed. And the abundant oxygen vacancies in NiO greatly improve the intrinsic activity and electrical conductivity. Benefit from these advantages, NiO-LFL NPs display a remarkable OER activity and stability in 1 M KOH, which is superior to the state-of-the-art RuO2 catalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0167-577X	1873-4979		WOS:000800442300009

Given their outstanding properties, carbon nanohorns (CNHs) have come forth as promising electrocatalysts within the nanocarbon family. Carbon nanohorns are conical nanostructures made of sp(2)carbon sheets that form aggregated superstructures during their synthesis. They require no metal catalyst during their preparation and they are inexpensively produced in industrial quantities, affording a favorable candidate for electrocatalytic reactions. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview regarding CNHs in the field of electrocatalysis and especially, in oxygen reduction, methanol oxidation, and hydrogen evolution, as well as oxygen evolution from water splitting, underlining the progress made so far, and pointing out the areas where significant improvement can be achieved.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9				2079-4991		WOS:000557300700001	32707696

Here, by studying the activity-stability trends for the oxygen evolution reaction on conductive (MOxHy)-O-1, Fe-(MOxHy)-O-1 and Fe-(MMOxHy)-M-1-O-2 hydr(oxy)oxide clusters (M-1 = Ni, Co, Fe; M-2 = Mn, Co, Cu), we show that balancing the rates of Fe dissolution and redeposition over a MOxHy host establishes dynamically stable Fe active sites. Together with tuning the Fe content of the electrolyte, the strong interaction of Fe with the MOxHy host is the key to controlling the average number of Fe active sites present at the solid/liquid interface. We suggest that the Fe-M adsorption energy can therefore serve as a reaction descriptor that unifies oxygen evolution reaction catalysis on 3d transition-metal hydr(oxy)oxides in alkaline media. Thus, the introduction of dynamically stable active sites extends the design rules for creating active and stable interfaces.Understanding what underpins the activity and stability of oxygen evolution catalysts is an ongoing issue in the field of water splitting. Now, researchers show that balancing the rate of Fe dissolution and deposition over a metal hydr(oxy)oxide host yields dynamically stable Fe active sites, with the Fe-host interaction key to the performance.									262	7	0	0	17	0	263			2058-7546			WOS:000520704000014

Increasing the number of active sites and optimizing the electronic structure of electrocatalysts are the key to realizing high catalytic activity. Herein, we report a controlled-selenylation self-templating strategy for synthesizing hierarchical structural oxygen-modified nanotubes as an electrocatalyst (O-CoSe2-HNT). The hierarchical structural O-CoSe2-HNT catalyst with an oxygen-rich surface exhibits an excellent catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a low overpotential of 252 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The high oxygen evolution catalytic activity of O-CoSe2-HNT can be attributed to the exposure of more active sites and optimization of the electronic structure via modifying oxygen on the catalyst surface. This work provides a new strategy to design efficient OER electrocatalysts with an oxygen-rich surface by a well-designed self-templating strategy.									36	1	0	0	0	0	36			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000473054500011

However, the efficiency of hydrogen production is limited by the amount of active sites, for example, edges, in MoS2. Here, we demonstrate that oxygen plasma exposure and hydrogen treatment on pristine monolayer MoS2 could introduce more active sites via the formation of defects within the monolayer, leading to a high density of exposed edges and a significant improvement of the hydrogen evolution activity. These as-fabricated defects are characterized at the scale from macroscopic continuum to discrete atoms.

However, the specific active nitrogen species in nitrogen-doped carriers remains unclear up to now. To identify the active nitrogen species, herein, we prepare nitrogen-doped carbon nanospheres containing different types of nitrogen species and a small amount of Fe atoms. Electrochemical tests demonstrate that the Fe/nitrogen-doped carbon nanospheres with more graphitic nitrogen exhibit much higher activity for the oxygen evolution reaction than those with more pyridinic nitrogens and pyrrolic nitrogens in alkaline media, revealing that the graphitic nitrogen is the active species that greatly improves the activity of Fe catalysts. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that the graphitic nitrogen enhances the activity and stability of Fe-based catalysts mainly through increasing the adsorption energy, charge and spin densities of the Fe atoms loaded around it. These findings provide a brand-new perspective for rationally designing more effective transition metal-based electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction through controlling the active graphitic nitrogen distribution in carbon carriers.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2046-2069		WOS:000459183800015	35514629

However, chloride ions (Cl-) in seawater can accelerate electrode corrosion and participate in the undesirable chlorine evolution reaction (CER). This problem is especially acute in acidic conditions that naturally arise at the anode as a result of the desired oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we demonstrate that ultrathin silicon oxide (SiOx) overlayers on model platinum anodes are highly effective at suppressing the CER in the presence of 0.6 M Cl- in both acidic and unbuffered pH-neutral electrolytes by blocking the transport of Cl- to the catalytically active buried interface while allowing the desired oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to occur there. The permeability of Cl- in SiOx overlayers is 3 orders of magnitude less than that of Cl- in a conventional salt-selective membrane used in reverse osmosis desalination. The overlayers also exhibit robust stability over 12 h in chronoamperometry tests at moderate overpotentials. SiOx overlayers demonstrate a promising step toward achieving selective and stable seawater electrolysis without the need to adjust the pH of the electrolyte.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000618540300023		
B	Berndt, D.; Jones, W.E.M.								Balanced float charging of VRLA batteries by means of catalysts								INTELEC - Twentieth International Telecommunications Energy Conference (Cat. No.98CH36263)								443	51		10.1109/INTLEC.1998.793568				1999	1999	The internal-oxygen cycle characterizes the VRLA battery as the main reaction during float charging. When it reaches a high efficiency, almost all the oxygen evolved at the positive electrode is reduced at the negative electrode. But, the two secondary reactions, hydrogen evolution and grid corrosion have also to be considered. With a highly efficient internal-oxygen cycle, the rates of these secondary reactions have to be equal. Otherwise, the basic law would not be fulfilled that equal currents must flow through both electrodes. As a consequence, the proportion between hydrogen evolution and grid corrosion determines the polarization of both electrodes. Only if hydrogen evolution and grid corrosion are well balanced, negative and positive electrodes are polarized sufficiently to keep their full charge. With the technical product 'battery' the desired balance is often not reached, and if the hydrogen evolution rate is high compared to grid corrosion, partial discharge of the negative electrodes occurs during float charging. Incorporation of a catalyst into the unbalanced cell is a promising possibility to solve the problem. It also reduces the efficiency of the internal oxygen cycle, since the catalyst recombines a certain portion of the oxygen before it can reach the negative electrode. As a consequence, a correspondingly increased amount of hydrogen must be generated at the negative electrode. This again requires an adequate polarization and so ensures full charge. Simultaneously, the positive electrode is less polarized, and grid corrosion reduced.

Upon anion doping, the band structure of hematite can be effectively regulated, leading to the generation of defect levels between the band gap and remarkably increased visible light absorption. The activity for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of the hematite nanocrystals is enhanced after fluorine doping, where the doped hematite assists as an effective catalyst for photoelectrochemical water splitting. The optimization strategy proposed herein may shed light on the future design of photocatalysts for energy-related applications.									44	2	0	0	0	0	44			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000416158500022	28801934

Perovskite oxide has been widely investigated for catalyzing the OER; however, the formation of cation-enriched secondary phases at the oxide/oxide interface blocks the active sites and decreases OER performance. Herein, we show that the Au/yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) interface possesses much higher OER activity than the lanthanum strontium manganite/YSZ anode. Electrochemical characterization and density functional theory calculations suggest that the Au/YSZ interface provides a favorable path for OER by triggering interfacial oxygen spillover from the YSZ to the Au surface. In situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results confirm the existence of spillover oxygen on the Au surface. This study demonstrates that the Au/YSZ interface possesses excellent catalytic activity for OER at high temperatures in SOECs.									21	1	0	0	0	0	21			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000462622700028	30737877

Clean energy technologies such as water electrolysis, fuel cells, and metal-air batteries heavily depend on a series of electrochemical redox reactions occurring on the catalysts surface. Therefore, developing efficient electrocatalysts is conducive to remarkably improved performance of these devices. Among numerous studies, transition metal-based nanomaterials (TMNs) have been considered as promising catalysts by virtue of their abundant reserves, low cost, and well-designed active sites. This Minireview is focused on the typical clean electrochemical reactions: hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and oxygen reduction reaction. Recent efforts to optimize the external morphology and the internal electronic structure of TMNs are described, and beginning with single-component TMNs, the active sites are clarified, and strategies for exposing more active sites are discussed. The summary about multi-component TMNs demonstrates the complementary advantages of integrating functional compositions. A general introduction of single-atom TMNs is provided to deepen the understanding of the catalytic process at an atomic scale.

The electrocatalytic performance of the fabricated electrodes with variable nickel mass loadings (0 30 wt%) was investigated. For Ni mass loading of 19.3 wt%, the resulting Ni/P-doped carbon exhibits optimum catalytic activity for oxygen reduction (ORR), oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The electrocatalyst reveals onset and half-wave potentials of 0.81 and 0.67 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and a kinetic limiting current density of 13.66 mA cm(-2) at 0.1 V vs. RHE for ORR. The material exhibits modest Tafel slopes of 67.6 and 134.9 mV dec(-1) and overpotentials of 368 and 297 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER, respectively.

Herein, a highly active multifunctional catalyst heterostructure PdO-doped Co3O4 (PdCo-300) nanoparticles with closely mutually connected interfaces were synthesized by a convenient strategy. The prepared PdCo-300 nanoparticles displayed high catalytic activities for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. The results show that the considerable electrocatalytic activities and stabilities are associated with the formation of MHNPs with intimate connected boundary between PdO and Co3O4. At the interface, the decrease of Pd electron density (downshift of the D-band center) and the formation of large amount of oxygen vacancies in Co3O4 promoted the electrocatalytic performance. Theoretical calculations show that the synergy of Pd ions and Co ions at the interface can enhance the interaction between active oxygen species and the catalyst surface, resulting in the decrease of energy barrier for ORR.									60	3	0	0	7	0	61			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000453616800018

Unique interactions between single metal sites and their surrounding coordination environments play a significant role in modulating the electronic structure of the metal centers, leading to unusual scaling relationships, new reaction mechanisms, and improved catalytic performance. This review summarizes recent advancements in engineering of the local coordination environment of SACs for improved electrocatalytic performance for several crucial energy-convention electrochemical reactions: oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, CO2 reduction reaction, and nitrogen reduction reaction. Various engineering strategies including heteroatom-doping, changing the location of SACs on their support, introducing external ligands, and constructing dual metal sites are comprehensively discussed. The controllable synthetic methods and the activity enhancement mechanism of state-of-the-art SACs are also highlighted.

Herein, the catalytic performance of indium-based bimetallic clusters anchored onto silicon-doped graphene (In2M2/Si-G, M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) as multifunctional electrocatalysts is investigated systematically by density functional theory methods. All the studied In2M2 bimetallic clusters can be stably anchored onto the Si-G substrate based on the calculated binding energy. Among these materials, In2V2/Si-G and In2Co(2)/Si-G are expected to be potential trifunctional (ORR/OER/HER) electrocatalysts with the low overpotentials of 0.51/0.76/-0.11 V and 0.56/0.36/-0.09 V, respectively. Emphatically, the electronic structure analysis reveals that such high catalytic activity can be attributed to the synergistic effect between indium and transition metal atoms, which could effectively promote electron transfer between catalyst and reaction species. This work would open a new perspective and provide guidance for designing promising multifunctional electrocatalysts to meet energy demand.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000874992000001

In this work, ruthenium-integrating porous bimetallic transition metal nanoarrays are efficiently generated from metal-organic framework-covered three-dimensional platforms such as carbon cloth using a simple solution-based deposition technique followed by calcination. Heterostructure ruthenium-cobalt-iron hollow nanoarrays are built to permit exceptionally effective multifunctional activities in reactions including the oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and oxygen reduction reaction. As presumed, the as-synthesized porous nanostructured arrays show remarkable electrochemical performance due to the benefits of copious active reaction sites, and efficient electron and ion transport channels. The oxygen reduction reaction of the porous nanostructured array electrocatalyst has a half-wave potential of 0.875 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode and can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 220 and 50 mV for the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, respectively, and the needed cell voltage for total water splitting is just 1.49 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2).

In this research, two-phase flow and bubble dynamics are in-situ studied in a special designed single channel electrolyzer. The devices fabricated by a 3D printer provide a whole vision of the electrochemical reaction within the channel. In-situ observations of channel-scale hydrogen and oxygen micro-bubbles dynamics are conducted, and the whole process of hydrogen evolution reactions (HERS) and oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) are simultaneously studied. The results indicate that all bubbles generate at the interface between the proton exchange membrane and the electrode wire, and the operating conditions have a great impact on the micro bubble evolution process. The bubble detachment diameter is inversely proportional to the flow velocity, but is in direct proportion to the current density. Finally, a mathematic model has been developed, and shows a good agreement with experimental data. Those results could help to better understand the bubble evolution mechanism, in order to further understand the electrochemical reaction. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

All four alkenes undergo combustion yielding H2O, CO, and CO2. No partial oxidation products were observed. H-2 is evolved after the oxygen is consumed. Compared to dehydrogenation reactions on the clean Pd(100) surface, O(a) inhibits both adsorption and reaction of ethylene. For propene, 1-butene, and 1,3-butadiene, in contrast, O(a) does not inhibit adsorption and also activates reactions-all C-H bonds react facilely with O(a) forming H2O below the dehydrogenation temperature on the clean surface, Isotope experiments show that initial reactions occur predominantly with the vinylic C-H bonds of 1-alkenes, Low-temperature CO2 evolution and desorption-limited CO evolution provide evidence for oxygen addition to the carbon atoms of dehydrogenated alkene intermediates. Indirect reactions resulting from dehydrogenation at clean sites and oxidation of H(a) and C(a) lead to high-temperature H2O evolution above 300 K and CO and CO2 evolution above 400 K.									41	1	0	0	0	0	41			0002-7863			WOS:A1995QZ71300013

The kinetics of both oxygen evolution (side reaction) and organics oxidation (main reaction) has been investigated using boron-doped diamond microelectrodes-array (BDD MEA). Oxygen evolution, in the high-potential region, takes place with a Tafel slope of 120 mV dec(-1) and zero reaction order with respect to H+. In the presence of organics, a shift of the polarization curves to lower potentials is observed while the Tafel slopes remain close to 120 mV dec(-1). A simplified model of C, organics oxidation is proposed. Both water discharge and organics oxidation are assumed to be fast reactions.

The Tafel slopes obtained by steady-state current-potentiel measurements were close to (2.3 RT/F) V per decade on these oxides. The reaction order with respect to OH- was found to be approximately 1.7. The oxygen evolution performance was found to increase with increase in Li content. A suitable mechanism involving a monoelectronic transfer reaction in a quasiequilibrium condition prior to a rate-determining step which involve peroxide ion has been suggested.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0021-7689			WOS:000081913600005

Homogeneous and stable nanoparticles (NPs) dispersed in solvents are useful as both electrocatalysts and cocatalysts of photocatalysts for the electro- and photo-catalytic oxygen evolution reaction, respectively, through their adsorption on various electrode substrates. Here, phase-segregated NiPx@FePyOz core@shell NPs are selectively synthesized by the reaction of Fe(CO)(5) with amorphous NiPx seed-NPs. The NiPx@FePyOz NPs on conductive substrates exhibit higher electrocatalytic activity in the oxygen evolution reaction than those of other metal phosphide-based catalysts. The NiPx@FePyOz NPs can also be used as a cocatalyst of an anodic BiVO4 photocatalyst to boost the photocatalytic water oxidation reaction. The excellent catalytic activity and high stability of the NiPx@FePyOz NPs without any post-treatments are derived from in situ activation through both the structural transformation of NiPx@FePyOz into mixed hydroxide species, (Ni, Fe)OxHy, and the spontaneous removal of the insulating organic ligands from NPs to form a smooth and robust (Ni, Fe)OxHy/substrate heterointerface during the oxygen evolution reaction.									16	2	0	0	1	0	16			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000434243300013	29910935

Different composites showed a different dependence of oxygen evolution current density on Co3O4 content.

It is found that the MnO-m-N-C composites promote both oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. They lead to reduced charge overpotentials through early decomposition of the Li2O2 particles formed on discharge, especially at the limited depth of discharge during the initial several ten cycles. Such superior activity is attributed to the good coupling between the nanosized MnO particles and the conductive mesoporous nitrogen-doped carbons, which is helpful for improving kinetics of both charge and mass transport during the cathode reactions.

The tip/probe of SECM is usually an ultramicroelectrode (UME) or a nanoelectrode that can move towards or over the sample of interest controlled by a precise motor positioning system. Remarkably, electrocatalysts play a crucial role in addressing the surge in global energy consumption by providing sustainable alternative energy sources. Therefore, the precise measurement of catalytic reactions offers profound insights for designing novel catalysts as well as for enhancing their performance. SECM proves to be an excellent tool for characterization and screening catalysts as the probe can rapidly scan along one direction over the sample array containing a large number of different compositions. These features make SECM more appealing than other conventional methodologies for assessing bulk solutions. SECM can be employed for investigating numerous catalytic reactions including the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), water oxidation, glucose oxidation reaction (GOR), and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) with high spatial resolution. Moreover, for improving the catalyst design, several SECM modes can be applied based on the catalytic reactions under evaluation. This review aims to present a brief overview of the recent applications of electrocatalysts and their kinetics as well as catalytic sites in electrochemical reactions, such as oxygen reduction, water oxidation, and methanol oxidation.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9				2073-4344		WOS:000653625000001

Owing to their low cost and high activity, transition metal oxides have attracted much attention as alternative electrocatalysts to replace the currently used noble metal-based catalysts. Anion defects (e.g., oxygen vacancies, interstitials, and anion dopants) can significantly change the electronic structure of oxides or the stability of adsorbed intermediates, thus greatly enhancing the electrocatalytic activities of the oxide surface. Anionic defect engineering represents a potential new direction for rational design of high-performance electrocatalysts. In this review, recent progress in manipulating the anion defects in transition metal oxides for enhancing their activity and stability is summarized and the proposed mechanisms for enhanced performance are discussed in detail.

In this study, oxygen surface treated Ni2P nanosheets as bifunctional catalysts for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is proposed based on density functional theory calculations. The mechanism of the enhanced electrocatalytic performance was investigated by considering oxygen adsorption and substitution of surface phosphorus on the Ni2P nanosheets surface. The results show that six O adsorption and six O substitution Ni2P exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance because of their tuned Gibbs free energy and overpotential for hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction being just -0.21 eV/0.27 V and - 0.15 eV/0.45 V, respectively. Additionally, due to the reducing of total potential, the catalysts can present better OER performance in alkaline media. The bicatalytic activities of O adsorption and O substitution can be well-explained by an amendatory p band-center model, which is also suitable for a broad class of surface engineering systems. This theoretical study not only provides vital insights into the enhanced mechanism of the bifunctional activities of water splitting but also helps to prescribe the principles for designing high performance multifunctional electrocatalysts.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000488957400078

Here, generally used CoFe based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) were first delaminated and exfoliated in the DMF-ethanol solvent (CoFe LDH-F), with enhancement both in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The exfoliation process creates more coordinatively unsaturated metals and improves the intrinsic electronic conductivity, which is important in water electrolyzer reactions. In the basic solution, the CoFe LDH-F catalyst outperforms the commercial iridium dioxide (IrO2) electrocatalyst in activity and stability for OER and approaches the performance of platinum (Pt) for HER. The bifunctional electrocatalysts can be further used for overall water splitting, with a current density of similar to 10 mA/cm(2) at the applied voltage of 1.63 V for long-term electrolysis test, rivalling the performance of Pt and IrO2 combination as benchmarks. Our findings demonstrate the promising catalytic activity of LDHs for scale-up alkaline water splitting.									252	13	0	0	11	0	255			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000390728900036	27998124

In particular, the remarkable technical progress in synthesis and characterization is promoting the rapid development of gold-based nanoalloys, which are of great significance in catalysis. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the recently reported gold-based nanoalloys, focusing on their general synthetic methods and potential catalytic applications. In particular, the general relationships between material structures/compositions and catalytic performances are discussed in representative chemical reactions, such as the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), small organic molecule oxidation reaction, carbon monoxide oxidation reaction, and typical heterogeneous catalytic reactions in chemical engineering. Furthermore, critical challenges and potential opportunities facing gold-based nanoalloys are proposed to provide possible inspiration for future material design towards high performance applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000671943400001

Herein, we developed a bimetallic cobalt-manganese sulfide supported on Ni foam (CMS/Ni) via a solvothermal method. It has discovered that after combining with the pure Co9S8 and MnS, the morphologies of CMS/Ni have modulated. The obtained three-dimensionally hexagram-like CMS/Ni nanosheets have a significant increase in electrochemical active surface area and charge transport ability. More than that, the synergetic effect of Co and Mn has also presented in this composite. Benefiting from these, the CMS/Ni electrode shows great performance toward hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in basic medium, comparing favorably to that of the pure Co9S8/Ni and MnS/Ni. More importantly, this versatile CMS/Ni can catalyze the water splitting in a two-electrode system at a potential of 1.47 V, and this electrolyzer can be efficiently driven by a 1.50 V commercial dry battery.									75	10	0	0	3	0	77			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000414106100006	30393655

Two different preparation methods have been used: coprecipitation of metal hydroxides and sol-gel. The different activity that is observed is related to the solid-state couple in octahedral sites. AlMn2O4 shows the poorest activity due to intrinsic resistivity. The substitution of Al by Ni increases the catalytic activity, the maximum being that exhibited by NiMn2O4. These electrochemical reactions can be used to detect the nature of the electrodes by way of the electrocatalytic activity. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this report, a novel highly active nanostructured IrO2/Ti anode for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was fabricated by depositing IrO2 nanoparticles onto Ti nanotube substrates. This nanostructured IrO2/Ti anode exhibits comparable oxygen evolution catalytic activities as the traditional IrO2/Ti dimensional stable anode with only 1% iridium consumption of the traditional method. This nanostructured IrO2/Ti anode would be a promising candidate method for fabricating high effective IrO2/Ti anode with low Ir consumption. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Herein, a series of vulcanized Co3O4 nanocubes with different vulcanization degree were synthesized. The optimized electrocatalyst delivered a lower overpotential of 314 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 67.4 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH. The catalyst after long time of OER operation was then characterized and compared with the pristine catalyst. It was found that the precatalyst experienced in situ phase evolution with the generation of CoOOH species. On the catalytic electrode, the catalytic layer should be composed of vulcanized CoSx/S-doped CoOOH that acts as catalytic active phase. This study provides new information for the sulfide electrocatalysts and is conducive to the design of advanced oxygen evolution catalysts.									14	1	0	0	1	0	14			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000620365800003

Here, we report an oxygen deficient cobalt tungstate nanoparticles with diameter of 8 nm (CoWO4-x@C) as efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (OER), which exhibits comparable HER activity to commercial Pt/C with overpotentials of 32.5 mV and 46.8 mV vs. RHE to deliver current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic and alkaline mediums, respectively, ascribed to the rich oxygen vacancies facilitating the hydrogen adsorption and its relative recombination, respectively. Additionally, undetectable degradation is observed for CoWO4-x@C after 10,000 potential cycles indicating high durability. Meanwhile, CoWO4-x@C requires only 295 mV overpotential to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) in the OER test, which is better than the benchmarking IrO2 (313 my). 1.57 V comparably lower than Pt/C-IrO2 (1.59 V) is required for achieving the water splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2) without any degradation for 12 h.									32	1	0	0	4	0	32			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000488308800051

In this work, the behavior of oxygen evolution and some other related electrode processes occurring at anodically grown TiO2 films on titanium were investigated within a relatively wide potential range by electrochemical measurements in 1 M perchloric acid solution. For the formation of the oxide film, three potential regions (two passive regions and the film breakdown region) were selected. The changes both in surface properties (mainly caused by oxygen evolution) and in bulk properties (mainly caused by increased potential) were taken into account for the observed different oxygen evolution behavior. The origin of a cathodic current peak at -0.2 V revealed in cyclic voltammograms was attributed to the reduction of the oxygen atoms adsorbed/absorbed at the oxide film surface, which were generated during anodic oxygen evolution. The flatband potential for the anodically formed titanium oxide films in 1.0 M HClO4 was estimated as -0.2 V. With the semiconducting energy band structure models constructed for the Ti/oxide film/1 M HClO4 electrode system, both the different behavior for anodic oxygen evolution on the titanium oxide films formed at different potentials and the electron transfer processes for the electrochemical reactions observed in this work were further interpreted.

Although noble metal based catalysts have demonstrated high activity for the oxygen evolution reaction, their application is limited by their high cost and low availability. Here we report the use of a molecule-to-cluster strategy for preparing ultrasmall trimetallic clusters by using the polyoxometalate molecule as a precursor. Ultrafine (0.8 nm) transition-metal clusters with controllable chemical composition are obtained. The transition-metal clusters enable highly efficient oxygen evolution through water electrolysis in alkaline media, manifested by an overpotential of 192 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 36 mV dec(-1), and long-term stability for 30 h of electrolysis. We note, however, that besides the excellent performance as an oxygen evolution catalyst, our molecule-to-cluster strategy provides a means to achieve well-defined transition-metal clusters in the subnanometer regime, which potentially can have an impact on several other applications.									42	3	0	0	2	0	43			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000455561800040	30540181

This subsequently enhances conductivity and catalytic activity of PCN (abbreviated as CoSx@PCN/rGO) and is achieved by one-step sulfuration of PCN/graphene oxides (GO) composite materials. As a result, the as-prepared CoSx@PCN/rGO catalysts display excellent activity and stability toward both oxygen evolution and reduction reactions, surpassing electrocatalytic performance shown by state-of-the-art Pt, RuO2 and other carbon nitrides. Remarkably, the CoSx@PCN/rGO bifunctional activity allows for applications in zinc-air batteries, which show better rechargeability than Pt/C. The enhanced catalytic performance of CoSx@PCN/rGO can primarily be attributed to the highly porous morphology and sufficiently exposed active sites that are favorable for electrocatalytic reactions.									118	8	0	0	4	0	117			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000419327200014

As-synthesized Ru-doped Ni/Fe MIL-53 MOF nanosheets grown on nickel foam (MIL-53(Ru-NiFe)@NF) afford HER and OER current density of 50 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 62 and 210 mV, respectively, in alkaline solution with a nominal Ru loading of approximate to 110 mu g cm(-2). When using as both anodic and cathodic (pre-)catalyst, MIL-53(Ru-NiFe)@NF enables overall water splitting at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) for a cell voltage of 1.6 V without iR compensation, which is much superior to state-of-the-art RuO2-Pt/C-based electrolyzer. It is discovered that the Ru-doping considerably modulates the growth of MOF to form thin nanosheets, and enhances the intrinsic HER electrocatalytic activity by accelerating the sluggish Volmer step and improving the intermediate oxygen adsorption for increased OER catalytic activity.									25	1	0	0	0	0	25			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000588430100001	32734617

In these regards, this present study focuses upon the synthesis of porous carbon (PC) or N-doped porous carbon (N-PC) acquired from golden shower pods biomass (GSB) via solvent-free synthesis. Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies confirmed the doping of nitrogen in N-PC. In addition, morphological analysis via field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) provide evidence of the sheet-like porous structure of N-PC. ORR results from N-PC show the four-electron pathway (average n = 3.6) for ORRs with a Tafel slope of 86 mV dec(-1) and a half-wave potential of 0.76 V. For OERs and HERs, N-PC@Ni shows better overpotential values of 314 and 179 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and its corresponding Tafel slopes are 132 and 98 mV dec(-1), respectively. The chronopotentiometry curve of N-PC@Ni reveals better stability toward OER and HER at 50 mA cm(-2) for 8 h. These consequences provide new pathways to fabricate efficient electrocatalysts of metal-free heteroatom-doped porous carbon from bio-waste/biomass for energy application in water splitting and metal air batteries.									56	4	1	0	1	0	58				2079-4991		WOS:000516825600076	31906170

Herein, a highly-efficient soluble redox mediator (RM) of N,N'-Diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPPD) is introduced to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction for Li-O-2 batteries. During charging process, DPPD is electrochemically oxidized into DPPD', which can chemically decompose Li2O2 on the cathode with a much-reduced overpotential. The in-situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry confirms that the charging process is dominated by Li2O2 decomposition. With the assistance of DPPD, Li-O-2 cells can achieve lower charging potential, improved cycling stability, and prolonged lifespan (294 cycles) which is three times longer than that of tetrathiafulvalene counterpart.

Here we adjust the different crystal planes of the cobalt oxides catalyst to expose more effective active sites through a hydrothermal process, so as to improve the reaction activity for oxygen evolution. The samples were well characterized by TEM, SEM and XRD. Among the three synthetic crystal planes (100), (111) and (110) of spinel cobalt oxides, the (100) crystal plane has the highest intrinsic activity. Combining in-situ infrared and DFT calculations, we observed that the oxygen evolution reaction reached the lowest energy barrier on the (100) plane of the cobalt oxide crystal. Further XPS analysis showed that the highest Co3+/Co~(2+) ratio was observed on the surface of the nanocube samples, indicating that Co3+ is a more active site for oxygen evolution catalytic activity.			由可再生能源驱动的水分解是一种有前途的生产清洁能源的技术,而发生在阳极的析氧反应是水分解反应的速率决定步骤。本文通过调整催化剂的晶面,暴露更多的有效活性位点调控尖晶石钴氧化物析氧反应活性。在三个合成晶面(100)、(111)和(110)中,(100)晶面本征活性最高。结合原位红外和DFT计算分析可知,OER反应在氧化钴晶体的(100)平面上反应能垒最低。XPS分析进一步表明,纳米立方体表面具有最高的Co3+/Co~(2+)比值,该结果表明Co3+是更活跃的析氧反应活性位点。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1006-3471			CSCD:7197402

We conducted the calculation for two types of FePt catalysts: FePt with an ordered L10 crystal structure and FePt with atoms randomly distributed at the face-centered-cubic (FCC) crystal sites. First, we investigated the surface energy of the L10 FePt surface and concluded that the reacting surface was a (111) surface because of its low surface energy. Next, we calculated the free energy of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) steps and obtained the theoretical overpotentials for the two types of FePt catalysts. The overpotentials for the ordered L10 and the disordered FCC FePt catalysts were found to be 2.26 V and 2.17 V, respectively.

Despite tremendous efforts, developing oxygen electrode catalysts with high activity at low cost remains a great challenge. Here, we report a hybrid material consisting of Co3O4 nanocrystals grown on reduced graphene oxide as a high-performance bi-functional catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Although Co3O4 or graphene oxide alone has little catalytic activity, their hybrid exhibits an unexpected, surprisingly high ORR activity that is further enhanced by nitrogen doping of graphene. The Co3O4/N-doped graphene hybrid exhibits similar catalytic activity but superior stability to Pt in alkaline solutions. The same hybrid is also highly active for OER, making it a high-performance non-precious metal-based bi-catalyst for both ORR and OER. The unusual catalytic activity arises from synergetic chemical coupling effects between Co3O4 and graphene.									4525	215	1	0	259	2	4598			1476-1122			WOS:000295155200015	21822263

The best performance for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions was observed for the KB electrode, which has the highest surface area among the carbon materials examined. A steady over-potential of 0.2 V was obtained for the oxygen reduction reaction using the KB electrode without the catalyst, while the over-potential was 0.15 V for KB with the LSCF catalyst at 2.0 mA cm(-2). The over-potentials for the oxygen evolution reaction were slightly higher than those for the oxygen reduction reaction, and gradually increased with the polarization period. Analysis of the gas in the cell after polarization above 0.4 V revealed the evolution of a small amount of CO during the oxygen evolution reaction by the decomposition of carbon in the electrode. The amount of CO evolved was significantly decreased by the addition of LSCF to the carbon electrode. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Herein, for the first time we report a novel and promising MOx (M = Mn, Fe, Co and Ni) nanosheets catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction based on the MnFeCoNi high entropy alloy. By an electrochemical cyclic voltammetry scan activation, the MOx nanosheets can grow directly on the MnFeCoNi high entropy alloy particle surfaces forming a core-shell structure. The core-shell structure exhibits a low overpotential of 302 mV to achieve current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 83.7 mV dec(-1) and exceptional long-term stability of electrolysis for over 20 h in 1 M KOH alkaline solution, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst RuO2. We make an investigation of the MnFeCoNi high entropy alloy before and after cyclic voltammetry scan activation on their morphologies, chemical states and elements composition to understand the materials evolution. The present work not only provides a promising electrocatalyst but also broadens the application areas of high entropy alloys.									82	15	0	0	2	0	85			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000474502800014

However, identifying cheap, abundant, yet effective oxygen evolution catalysts to develop water splitting is still a challenge. Here, Fe-doped lithium cobalt oxide nanosheets have been synthesized via a soft chemical exfoliation method. Electrochemical tests revealed that the as-obtained Fe-doped lithium cobalt oxide nanosheets afforded an overpotential of 343 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a mass activity of 88.34 A g(-1), and a relatively small Tafel slope of 37.8 mV dec(-1). These parameters are better than those of many reported materials and even better than that of the benchmark IrO2. Such an excellent performance can be attributed to the merits of the special electronic structure feature of surface Co ions, high surface area, active sites, and enriched electrophilicity of non-lattice oxygen species.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000468964200009

A typical Kolbe reaction involving the acetate electro-oxidation was used as a study model. To this end, the TG/SC method of acetate electro-oxidation was performed at a 10 mu m-diameter tip Pt disk microelectrode positioned similar to 1.2 mu m away from a 50 mu m-diameter substrate Pt disk microelectrode. The substrate Pt was employed as an efficient catalyst to monitor the byproduct O-2 produced at the tip by the catalytic reduction at an appropriate electrode potential. The linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) results indicated that O-2 evolution during acetate oxidation depended on both the electrode potential and acetate concentration. At low potentials (<2.4V vs. Ag/AgCl), the current of O-2 evolution dominated the acetate oxidation reaction in 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte, while O-2 evolution was inhibited at the joint condition of higher potentials (>2.4V) and elevated concentrations of acetate, resulting in better current efficiencies of acetate oxidation. The inhibition effect of O-2 evolution was also confirmed in alkaline electrolytes, consistent with the reported literature dealing with other traditional detection techniques. In sum, the proposed detection technique based on in-situ and real-time dynamic monitoring of oxygen evolution was accurate and sensitive, thereby promising for the study of broad range of reactions involving the generation of oxygen species.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1452-3981			WOS:000620082300032

Furthermore, ZIF-9-d/NF (60 h) exhibits excellent stability without obvious attenuation for at least 30 h at 200 mA cm(-2). The excellent performances can be attributed to the combination of the highly exposed active sites in the ZIF-9-d nanosheets, as well as the effective electron conduction and mass transfer.

A key challenge is the efficient production of hydrogen to meet the commercial-scale demand of hydrogen. Water splitting electrolysis is a promising pathway to achieve the efficient hydrogen production in terms of energy conversion and storage in which catalysis or electrocatalysis plays a critical role. The development of active, stable, and low-cost catalysts or electrocatalysts is an essential prerequisite for achieving the desired electrocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting for practical use, which constitutes the central focus of this review. It will start with an introduction of the water splitting performance evaluation of various electrocatalysts in terms of activity, stability, and efficiency. This will be followed by outlining current knowledge on the two half-cell reactions, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), in terms of reaction mechanisms in alkaline and acidic media. Recent advances in the design and preparation of nanostructured noble-metal and non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts will be discussed. New strategies and insights in exploring the synergistic structure, morphology, composition, and active sites of the nanostructured electrocatalysts for increasing the electrocatalytic activity and stability in HER and OER will be highlighted. Finally, future challenges and perspectives in the design of active and robust electrocatalysts for HER and OER towards efficient production of hydrogen from water splitting electrolysis will also be outlined.									112	1	0	0	7	0	112			2196-5404			WOS:000617205900001	33575919

Here, we demonstrate that cauliflower-like S-doped iron microsphere films are materials that can efficiently decompose water as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction. FeSx films are prepared by a simple one-step electrodeposition method and directly grow on copper foam from a deep eutectic solvent, ethaline (mixture of choline chloride and ethylene glycol), as a durable and highly efficient catalyst for the OER in 1.0 M KOH. The prepared FeSx/CF, as an oxygen-evolving anode, shows remarkable catalytic performance toward the OER with a moderate Tafel slope of 105 mV dec(-1), and require an overpotential of only 340 mV to drive a geometrical catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, this catalyst also demonstrates strong long-term electrochemical durability.

Herein, following the d-band center positions and using a simple sol-gel method followed by a pyrolysis step, LaNi1-xCo0.5xFe0.5xO3(LNFCO-x; x = 0.0, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6) electrocatalysts are designed and synthesized for oxygen redox reactions in 1 M KOH. Among them, LNFC0-0.5 has exhibited the lowest overpotential and the highest charge transfer kinetics in oxygen redox reactions. Overall, a 90 mV lower overpotential was observed in oxygen redox activity of LNFC0-0.5 compared to that of pristine LaNiO3. The mass activity of LNFCO-0.5 in the oxygen reduction reaction (at 0.7 V vs RHE) and oxygen evolution reaction (1.60 V vs RHE) was calculated to be 2.5 and 2.13 times higher than that of LaNiO3, respectively. The bifunctionality index (potential difference between the oxygen evolution at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and the oxygen reduction at a current density of -1 mA cm(-2)) of LNFC0-0.5 was found to be 0.98. The substitution of Fe and Co for the Ni-site shifted the d-band center close to the Fermi level, which can increase strength of the *OH intermediate in the rate-determining step. Also, the surface was enriched with Fe3+Delta, Co3+, and partially the binding oxidized Ni-3(+) states, which is susceptible to tune the e(g)-orbital filling for superior oxygen redox activity.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000742731400001

Achieving a single phase that offers both functionalities is of practical relevance. Here, we report a facile method to couple Fe-N(x)moieties and FeNi(3)nanoparticles, and embed these in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (Fe/FeNi3@NC). The Fe/FeNi3@NC catalyst demonstrates excellent bifunctional performance in 0.10 molar potassium hydroxide. We observe a half-wave potential of 0.83 V for ORR, and a potential of 1.58 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)for OER. The oxygen electrode fabricated using Fe/FeNi3@NC exhibits a peak power density of 143 mW cm(-2)for rechargeable Zn-air battery. Over a similar to 9 h duration test, the material is also shown to be as stable as the commercial Pt/C + IrO(2)in operating conditions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000582187900001

A rapid photocorrosion method is now used to synthesize the homogeneous amorphous nanocages of Cu-Ni-Fe hydr(oxy)oxide as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The as-fabricated product exhibits a low overpotential of 224mV on a glassy carbon electrode at 10mAcm(-2) (even lower down to 181mV when supported on Ni foam) with a Tafel slope of 44mVdec(-1) for OER in an alkaline solution. The obtained catalyst shows an extraordinarily large mass activity of 1464.5Ag(-1) at overpotential of 300mV, which is the highest mass activity for OER. This synthetic strategy may open a brand new pathway to prepare copper-based ternary amorphous nanocages for greatly enhanced oxygen evolution.									116	11	0	0	4	0	117			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000462655400013	30672090

In this study, we investigate improving the performance of iron catalysts via surface decoration with gold or platinum for not only the OER but also the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for overall water splitting in an alkaline electrolyte. Two types of iron catalysts were synthesised, iron nanocubes and iron oxide via electrochemical deposition methods which were decorated with either Au or Pt via galvanic replacement. It was found that the presence of Au significantly enhanced the OER performance of iron oxide and the HER performance of iron nanocubes. The presence of Pt resulted in moderate improvement in the OER but significant improvement for the HER but did not surpass the performance of gold decorated iron nanocubes. This indicates that the speciation of the iron catalyst and the decorating metal was important for tuning the activity to the OER and the HER. For the OER, the formation of iron oxide/Au interfaces was determined to be an important component for high activity whereas the metallic nature of metal decorated iron nanocubes was important for the HER. Therefore, iron based catalysts can be modified to demonstrate bifunctional behaviour for overall water splitting via the inclusion of gold nanoparticles.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000589810900001	33150695

Herein, we present a study on bifunctional catalysts as air electrodes aimed at metal-air batteries based on nickel and cobalt spinel (NiCo2O4) supported on electrospun carbon nanofibers. The physicochemical features of these transition-metal-based catalysts are essential for the understanding of their electrochemical activity. Results show that the major presence of oxidized Ni and Co species (Ni3+ and Co3+) produces higher activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), whereas lower oxidation states of the metals (Ni2+, Co2+, Ni-0 and Co-0) together with the presence of N-doped carbon lead to enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. This study highlights the importance of designing catalysts in terms of crystallographic structure and proper oxidation states of the elements for maximizing their performance.									16	2	0	0	0	0	16			2196-0216			WOS:000513102700016

Current water electrolyzers must operate with a protective current in stand-by/idle modes to avoid a substantial catalyst degradation. Here, we show a hierarchically structured porous ternary composite catalyst of nickel, cobalt and iron (NiCoFe) hydroxides prepared via electrodeposition on three-dimensional (3D) nickel foam (NF) substrates as reversible bifunctional electrodes for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The NiCoFe/NF electrode exhibits exceptionally high catalytic activity, requiring overpotentials as low as 220 and 50mV, respectively, for OER and HER to occur. In a water electrolysis cell comprising of two NiCoFe/NF electrodes, an overall cell overpotential of merely 300mV is required to deliver a stabilized current density of 3mAcm(-2). The ternary electrocatalyst also exhibits prolonged stability under both continuous and intermittent electrolysis and can be used for oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reversibly without degradation.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11				2567-3173		WOS:000682527100002

However, their low active-site loading, poor interactions, and unclear catalytic mechanism call for significant advances. Herein, atomically dispersed Ni/Co dual sites anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon (a-NiCo/NC) hollow prisms are rationally designed and synthesized. Benefiting from the atomically dispersed dual-metal sites and their synergistic interactions, the obtained a-NiCo/NC sample exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity and kinetics towards the oxygen evolution reaction. Moreover, density functional theory calculations indicate that the strong synergistic interactions from heteronuclear paired Ni/Co dual sites lead to the optimization of the electronic structure and the reduced reaction energy barrier. This work provides a promising strategy for the synthesis of high-efficiency atomically dispersed dual-site SACs in the field of electrochemical energy storage and conversion.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000842511100001	35894631

Here, nickel-molybdenum oxysulfide is deliberately fabricated as pre-catalyst to present a comprehensive study on reconstruction dynamics for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkali water electrolysis. Operando Raman spectroscopy together with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron microscopy capture dynamic reconstruction including geometric, component and phase evolutions, revealing a chameleon-like reconstruction self-adaptive to OER and HER demands under oxidative and reductive conditions, respectively. The in situ generated active NiOOH and Ni species with ultrafine and porous textures exhibit superior OER and HER performance, respectively, and an electrolyzer with such two reconstructed electrodes demonstrates steady overall water splitting with an extraordinary 80% electricity-to-hydrogen (ETH) energy conversion efficiency.

Fe2.1Co0.9O4/C NH having minor content of Co3+ exhibited superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance than the other compositions and benchmark Pt/C. It exhibits a current density of 8.4 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH for ORR compared to the benchmark Pt/C (3.81 mA cm(-2)). It also reveals superior stability and durability than Pt/C. It can retain 92 % of its initial current up to 7000 s. Also, the Fe2.1Co0.9O4/C NH delivers the best Tafel slope of 72.6 mV dec(-1). Additionally, the Co3+ rich Fe0.9Co2.1O4/C NH demonstrated superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance than the Pt/C, RuO2 and other compositions in 0.1 M KOH solution.

This unique core-shell structure with potential synergistic interaction leads to high activities towards oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. As a proof-of-concept, the as-prepared NC@GC catalyst exhibits excellent performance in the primary and rechargeable ZnABs.

In all cases, the ground state exhibits an extended antiferromagnetic coupling in the unit cell. Layered antiparallel alignment of the magnetic moments appears to be related to their electrocatalytic activity. All the perovskites calculated within this paper show space-separated charge-transport channels depending on the spin orientation. Comparing the electronic structures with the reported activities, we find a direct correlation between the magnetic accumulation on the spin channels in the bulk material and the catalytic activity. We discuss the possible implications of such observations in terms of magnetic interactions. During oxygen evolution in water electrolysis, reactants and products do not preserve spin. For triplet state oxygen to evolve, the catalyst at the anode can speed up the reaction if it is able to balance the magnetism of the oxygen molecule by extracting electrons with an opposite magnetic moment, conserving the overall spin.									42	0	0	0	5	0	42			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000386919300017

Herein, we report that nanoarrays of CoP supported on carbon cloth are an efficient bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting. The catalyst exhibits remarkable activity for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media, delivering a current density of 10mAcm(-2) at an overpotential of 281mV for OER and 95mV for HER. During electrocatalysis, the surface of the CoP catalyst was covered with a layer of CoOx, which was the active species. However, the CoP core and the nanoarray morphology contributed significantly to the activity.									165	8	0	0	8	0	166			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000372191600008	26811938

Here we present that a significant enhancement in electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction of 6H-SrIrO3 can be achieved by cobalt incorporation. A suitable amount of cobalt dopants results in a decreased formation temperature of 6H-SrIrO3 from 700 to 500 degrees C and thereby a decreased thickness of platelike particles for the material. Besides the morphological effect, the cobalt incorporation also increases the coverage of surface hydroxyl groups, regulates the Ir-O bond covalency, and modulates the oxygen p-band center of the material. This synergistic optimization of the morphological, surface, and electronic structures makes the cobalt-doped 6H-SrIrO3 catalyst give a 3-fold increase in iridium mass activity for oxygen evolution reaction in comparison with the undoped 6H-SrIrO3 under acidic conditions.									33	1	0	0	2	0	31			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000497263600017	31633901

This dilemma limits the development of higher-performance electrocatalysts that are required by next-generation electrochemical technologies. Here it is demonstrated that the inverse catalytic activity-structural stability relation can be broken by alloying catalytically inert strontium zirconate with the other catalytically active perovskite, strontium iridate. This strategy results in an alloyed perovskite electrocatalyst with simultaneously improved iridium mass activity and structural stability, by about five times, for the oxygen evolution reaction under acidic conditions. The experimental and theoretical results suggest that the alloying strategy generates multiple positive effects, mainly including the reduction of catalyst size, the decrease of catalyst covalency, and the weakening of surface oxygen-binding ability. The synergistic optimization of bulk and surface properties, as a result, enhances the intrinsic activity and availability of surface iridium sites, whilst significantly inhibiting the surface cation corrosion during electrocatalysis.									52	3	0	0	3	0	51			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000549866900001	32686216

However, the discovery of suitable catalysts with high activity and low cost remains a great challenge. In this work, we report a single-atom trifunctional catalyst, namely Ti3C2O2 supported single Pd atom (Pd-1@Ti3C2O2), for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This catalyst is selected from 12 candidates and possesses low overpotentials of 0.22 V, 0.31 V and 0.34 V for the HER, OER and ORR, respectively, making it an excellent electrocatalyst for both overall water splitting and rechargeable air-based batteries. The superior OER and ORR performance originates from the optimal d band center of the supported Pd atom. Moreover, the excellent activity can be maintained even if the single Pd atoms aggregate into small clusters. This work offers new opportunities for advancing the renewable energy storage and conversion technologies and paves a new way for the development of multifunctional electrocatalysts.									32	3	0	0	0	0	33			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000530495500025

We report a novel Co/Co-Fe nanoparticles/N-doped carbon composite electrocatalyst (Co/CoxFey/NC) obtained by pyrolysis of CoFe layered double hydroxide (CoFe LDH) embedded in a film of a bisphenol A and tetraethylenepentamine-based polybenzoxazine poly(BA-tepa). During pyrolysis poly(BA-tepa) forms a highly conductive nitrogen-doped carbon matrix encapsulating Co/Co-Fe nanoparticles, thereby circumventing the need of any additional binder material and conductive additives. Optimization with respect to pyrolysis temperature, the CoFe LDH/BA-tepa ratio, as well as of the gas atmosphere used during the thermal treatment was performed. The optimized Co/CoxFey/NC composite material catalyst exhibits remarkable bifunctional activity towards oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions in 0.1 M KOH represented by a potential difference of only 0.77 V between the potentials at which current densities of -1 mA cm(-2) for the ORR and 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER were recorded. Moreover, the Co/CoxFey/NC composite material pyrolyzed in ammonia atmosphere exhibits promising stability during both the ORR and the OER. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Perceiving this, countless research works focussing on the fundamentals of electrocatalysis of water splitting and on performance improvements are being reported everyday around the globe. Electrocatalysts of high activity, selectivity, and stability are anticipated as they directly determine energy- and cost efficiency of water electrolyzers. Amorphous electrocatalysts with several advantages over crystalline counterparts are found to perform better in electrocatalytic water splitting. There are plenty of studies witnessing performance enhancements in electrocatalysis of water splitting while employing amorphous materials as catalysts. The harmony between the flexibility of amorphous electrocatalysts and electrocatalysis of water splitting (both the oxygen evolution reaction [OER] and the hydrogen evolution reaction [HER]) is one of the untold and unsummarized stories in the field of electrocatalytic water splitting. This Review is devoted to comprehensively discussing the upsurge of amorphous electrocatalysts in electrochemical water splitting. In addition to that, the basics of electrocatalysis of water splitting are also elaborately introduced and the characteristics of a good electrocatalyst for OER and HER are discussed.									226	5	0	0	9	0	227			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000501828600001	31823508

These materials have shown promising properties for this half-reaction both under (unbiased) visible-light photocatalytic approach in the presence of an electron scavenger and as electrocatalysts in dark conditions in basic media. In both situations, Co0.8Ni0.2TiO3 exhibits the best performance and is proved to display high faradaic efficiency. A synergetic effect between Co and Ni is established, improving the physicochemical properties such as surface area and pore size distribution, besides affecting the donor density and the charge carrier separation. At higher Ni content, the materials exhibit behavior more similar to that of NiTiO3, which is a less suitable material for OER than CoTiO3.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000416614600046	29094924

Very recently, it has been predicted that FGT possesses exposed active sites on its basal plane which can provide excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, with a low OER overpotential of 0.30 V, following surface hydroxyl pathways. NGT has a similar chemical and crystalline structure; however, its performance as an electrochemical catalyst is not yet reported. Thus, FGT and NGT were synthesized by solid-state reaction and, for the first time, exfoliated by shear force. The prepared materials were investigated as electrocatalysts, thus comparing the catalytic performance of MGT materials, bulk and exfoliated counterparts, towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen-involving reactions (OER and the oxygen reduction reaction). Ferromagnetic transitions and Curie-Weiss contributions were noticed in FGT and NGT, respectively, in the analysis of their temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility. For the HER, exfoliated FGT has superior catalytic activity in alkaline media and for OER, improved catalytic activity was attained by using more conductive supports as compared with the glassy carbon substrate. FGT achieved the best OER performance, in agreement with the theoretically predicted value following the classical pathway in alkaline media.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2452-2627			WOS:000754736000006

An applying magnetic field (MF) enhancement method is presented to improve the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of NiCo-spinel magnetic catalysts, the enhancement of OER performance depends on the applied MF strength and magnetic properties of catalysts. The maximum enhanced current density percentage of about 90.6%, 93.7%, and 70.1% are obtained by applying 105 mT MF in NiCo2O4, Ni1.5Co1.5O4, and Ni2CoO4, respectively. The enhanced performance originates from the improved intrinsic activity and facilitated mass transfer process. The MF decreases the activation energy, which then leads to the improvement of intrinsic activity. This work provides more basic data for further gaining into the enhanced mechanism by applying the MF, meanwhile, the strategy can be used to enhance the performances of other electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000704449500001	34547727

Nevertheless, replacing sluggish water oxidation with smart anodic reactions would greatly lower the overall cost of energy and the electrode by using earth-abundant electrocatalysts. Herein, a Ni3Se4 nanorod array is prepared by an in situ hydrothermal selenization method and demonstrates excellent activity for anodic reactions. Assisted by this versatile Ni3Se4 nanorod array, only 240mV overpotential is required to drive 10 mA cm(-2) of oxygen evolution current steadily. By substituting oxygen evolution with urea and hydrazine oxidation, the anodic potential can be reduced from 1.47 V to 1.38 V and even further to 0.32 V to afford 10 mA cm(-2) anodic current density. Substituting anodic reactions coupled with the non-precious electrocatalyst demonstrated in the hybrid water electrolysis in this study has promising potential for future energy conversion, environmental treatment and valuable chemical upgrading.									63	2	0	0	5	0	63			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000442385800020

In this work, cuprous oxide film for photo-catalytic water oxidation and oxygen evolution under visible light was in-situ prepared on a copper foil with an anodization based method. The surface features of cuprous oxide film were characterized with X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The oxygen evolution capacity of as-obtained cuprous oxide film was evaluated with a water photolysis system, and an oxygen yield of 233.27 mu mol per milligram of cuprous oxide was achieved during 8 h of illumination. During the reaction, water was oxidized by the photo-generated holes in cuprous oxide, and the copper/cuprous oxide heterojunction can effectively separate the photo-generated electron-hole pairs, which promote the catalytic activity of cuprous oxide film. The oxygen evolution reaction was driven by the bending of energy band of cuprous oxide caused by the semiconductor-metal contact. The remaining protons by the water oxidation resulted in the acidizing of water. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									15	1	0	0	3	0	16			0927-0248	1879-3398		WOS:000346549400038

Transition metal carbides (TMCs) have been investigated as remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts but few used as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Herein, a Co doped Ni3C/Ni uniformly dispersed in a graphitic carbon matrix was prepared by pyrolysis of a metal organic framework (Co/Ni-MOF) under a flow of Ar/H-2 at 350 degrees C, and Ni3C/Ni@C was also prepared for comparison. The various characterization techniques confirmed the successful preparation of the heteroatom doped TMCs-based catalysts by pyrolysis of MOFs. Co doped Ni3C/Ni@C exhibited superior electrocatalytic properties for OER. For example, Co-Ni3C/Ni@C depicts a lower overpotential and smaller Tafel slope than Ni3C/Ni@C and IrO2 during the OER in 1 M KOH solution, additionally, it shows a higher active surface area than Ni3C/Ni@C. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance of Co-doped Ni3C/Ni@C in the OER was mainly ascribed to the synergistic effect of the Co and Ni3C/Ni active sites.

Herein, we present a facile one-pot synthesis of defect-rich heterojunction electrocatalysts composed of ultrathin cobalt nickel layered double hydroxides nanosheets with oxygen vacancies (OV), and covering on carbon nanotubes (CNT@NiCo LDH-OV) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The synthesized CNT@NiCo LDH-OV nanosheets possess a thickness ranges from 0.86 to 2.05 nm. The CNT@NiCo LDH-OV displays outstanding OER performance with an overpotential of 257 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope for 51 mV dec(-1). Moreover, water splitting catalyzed by CNT@NiCo LDH-OV delivers 1.54 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that oxygen vacancy and CNT can greatly reduce the band gap of the catalyst, making it has excellent conductivity. Simultaneously, the calculated (Delta G(O) - Delta G(OH) ) for CNT@NiCo LDH-OV is closer to 1.23 eV, which is more efficient for OER. This work develops a simple strategy to fabricate high catalytic activity composite material rich in oxygen vacancies toward OER.									20	2	0	0	2	0	21			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000540455700020

However, the multiple steps associated with proton-coupled electron transfer result in sluggish OER kinetics and catalysts are required. Here we demonstrate that a novel nitride, Ni2Mo3N, is a highly active OER catalyst that outperforms the benchmark material RuO2. Ni2Mo3N exhibits a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)at a nominal overpotential of 270 mV in 0.1 mKOH with outstanding catalytic cyclability and durability. Structural characterization and computational studies reveal that the excellent activity stems from the formation of a surface-oxide-rich activation layer (SOAL). Secondary Mo atoms on the surface act as electron pumps that stabilize oxygen-containing species and facilitate the continuity of the reactions.

Structure investigations show that the NiCuP@rGO has a nanotube structure, whereas NiCuN@rGO has aggregated nanorods structure. The catalytic performance of NiCuP@rGO and NiCuN@rGO for ORR and OER were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), Tafel, rotating disc electrode (RDE) and rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE) tests and other methodologies. Results showed that both NiCuP@rGO and NiCuN@rGO had good catalytic performance for ORR, which major happened through 4-electron pathway. Thus, the catalytic performance of NiCuP@rGO for OER was much higher than that of NiCuN@rGO. The great difference in the catalytic performance should be attributed to the different electronegativity of nitrogen and phosphorus. The higher negativity of nitrogen facilitates the electron transfer from catalyst to oxygen molecules but inhibits the acceptance of electron from hydroxide ions in the alkaline electrolyte. On the other hand, the nanotube structure of NiCuP@rGO with superior electron conductivity facilitates the OER reaction on the catalyst surface. This paper provides a reference for the design of novel catalysts for ORR and OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2365-6549			WOS:000536716700003

In this work, a series of Fe-Co-B nanosheets with different molar ratio of Fe/Co precursor have been recombined with bacterial cellulose based carbon nanofiber (BCCNF) through simple electroless deposition method at room temperature. It is indicated that, when the Fe/Co molar ratio is 1:3, Fe-Co-B/BCCNF exhibits an excellent catalytic property with overpotential of only 160 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, it displays a prominent electrochemical stability, even over 30 h of OER process under alkaline condition. The strategy of designing 3D nanostructure and constructing metal-boride-based catalyst for OER provides valuable insights into efficient oxygen evolution.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Herein, we report the synthesis and activity of a phase-pure nanocrystal perovskite catalyst that is highly active for the OER and ORR. The OER mass activity of LaNiO3, synthesized by the calcination of a rapidly dried nanoparticle dispersion and supported on nitrogen-doped carbon, is demonstrated to be nearly 3-fold that of 6 nm IrO2 and exhibits no hysteresis during oxygen evolution. Moreover, strong OER/ORR bifimctionality is shown by the low total overpotential (1.02 V) between the reactions, on par or better than that of noble metal catalysts such as Pt (1.16 V) and Ir (0.92 V). These results are examined in the context of surface hydroxylation, and a new OER cycle is proposed that unifies theory and the unique surface properties of LaNiO3.									261	9	0	0	11	0	266			1948-7185			WOS:000317950400006	26282138

The synthesis strategy of GDY by facile coupling reactions under mild conditions provides more convenience for the functional modification of GDY and offers opportunities for realizing the special preparation of GDY according to the desired structure and unique properties. These structural characteristics and excellent physical and chemical properties of GDY have attracted increasing attention in the field of electrocatalysis. Herein, the research progress in the synthesis of atomic-level functionalized GDYs and their electrocatalytic applications are summarized. Special attention was paid to the research progress of metal-atom-anchored and nonmetallic-atom-doped GDYs for applications in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic processes. In addition, several potential development prospects and challenges of these 2D highly conjugated electron-rich full-carbon materials in the field of electrocatalysis are presented.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2073-4344		WOS:000564662700001

FeCo(H3O)(PO4)(2) NAs as precatalyst could undergo significant self-reconstruction, including leaching of phosphate anions and electro-oxidation of Co2+ during anodizing at the potential range of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH solution, eventually resulting in the formation of Fe0.5Co0.5OOH NAs with low crystallinity. The high content of Fe in Fe0.5Co0.5OOH NAs promoted the formation of active Fe3+-O-Fe3+ motifs that increased OER occurrence. Additionally, Fe incorporation increased the ratio of the reaction rate constants of oxygen evolution to Co3+/Co4+ (k(OER)/k(M,ox)) and enhanced the reaction order on the hydroxyl ion. These factors significantly contributed to the outstanding OER catalytic performances of Fe0.5Co0.5OOH NAs.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000787898700005

The operational efficiency of EWS is governed in part by the electrocatalysts for two electrode reactions, namely, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this review, we highlight recent fundamental and experimental progress on tuning the electronic structure of electrocatalysts for enhanced EWS. In particular, we discuss several strategies to adjust the electronic structure of nanoelectrocatalysts, including: alloying, doping, interfacing, incorporating oxygen vacancies, and edge-defect engineering. Finally, some invigorating perspectives for future research directions are also provided.									59	3	0	0	2	0	59				2589-5974		WOS:000521129600014

Importantly, this method can be used to synthesize 4H/fcc-Au@Os and 4H/fcc-Au@IrOs core-shell NRBs.

The established ATCs, including metals (alloys), layered double hydroxides (LDHs), transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), transition metal oxides (TMOs), and carbon-based materials, have exhibited higher efficiency and better catalytic stability than that of commercial noble metal-based nanocrystals for energy conversion related reactions. In this review, important progress is exemplified from the aspects of synthetic methods (e.g., bottom-up and top-down methods) and energy conversion related reactions, for instance, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR), methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CRR). Furthermore, a valuable insight into the remaining challenges and potential opportunities for ATCs is provided in the fields of energy conversion applications.									26	2	0	0	0	0	26			2366-9608			WOS:000540627800001

Herein, two non-noble metal-based multifunctional electrocatalysts of N-doped carbon nanotubes NCNT/CoFeCoFe2O4 and NCNT/MnO(MnFe)(2)O-3 are prepared by a simple solvothermal procedure, followed by two-step annealing under the argon and ammonia atmosphere. The resultant electrocatalysts exhibit good trifunctional performances for HER, ORR, and OER. Notably, the NCNT/CoFeCoFe2O4 and NCNT/MnO(MnFe)(2)O-3 assembled zinc-air batteries exhibit high energy densities of 727 and 776 W h kg(Zn)(-1) at the current density of 20 mA cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, the NCNT/CoFeCoFe2O4-based rechargeable zinc-air battery remains excellent durability after discharge-charge cycle testing for 22 h, comparable to the noble metal-based catalyst (Pt/C + IrO2)-assembled zinc-air battery. Furthermore, the NCNT/CoFeCoFe2O4 and NCNT/MnO(MnFe)(2)O-3-assembled water splitting cells need similar to 1.65 and 1.70 V, respectively, to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), lower than that of IrO2Pt/C (1.71 V) and present excellent durability under long-term electrolysis. This work provides a facile strategy to prepare highly active multiple functional electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage.									39	1	0	0	1	0	40			1944-8244			WOS:000451496000047	30376289

The underlying mechanism was explored by designing and synthesizing a series of stable metal-organic frameworks (MOFs: NNU-21-24) based on trinuclear metal carboxylate clusters and tridentate carboxylate ligands. Among the examined stable MOFs, NNU-23 exhibits the best OER performance; particularly, compared with monometallic MOFs, all the bimetallic MOFs display improved OER activity. DFT calculations and experimental results demonstrate that introduction of the second metal atom can improve the activity of the original atom. The proposed model of bimetallic electrocatalysts affecting their OER performance can facilitate design of efficient bimetallic catalysts for energy storage and conversion, and investigation of the related catalytic mechanisms.									238	11	0	0	9	0	237			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000439741900009	29660248

Here, we show that nanocrystalline CeO2 in a Co3O4/CeO2 nanocomposite can modify the redox properties of Co3O4 and enhances its intrinsic oxygen evolution reaction activity, and combine electrochemical and structural characterizations including kinetic isotope effect, pH- and temperature-dependence, in situ Raman and ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy analyses to understand the origin. The local bonding environment of Co3O4 can be modified after the introduction of nanocrystalline CeO2, which allows the Co-III species to be easily oxidized into catalytically active Co-IV species, bypassing the potential-determining surface reconstruction process. Co3O4/CeO2 displays a comparable stability to Co3O4 thus breaks the activity/stability tradeoff. This work not only establishes an efficient earth-abundant catalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction, but also provides strategies for designing more active catalysts for other reactions. Developing efficient and stable earth-abundant electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction is challenging. Here, the authors modify the local bonding environment of Co3O4 by CeO2 nanocrystallites to regulate the redox properties, thus enhance the catalytic activity.									74	2	0	0	6	0	73			2041-1723			WOS:000658769300005	34031417

Amorphous catalysts are reported to show better activities of water oxidation than their crystalline counterparts, but little is known about the underlying origin, which retards the development of high-performance amorphous oxygen evolution reaction catalysts. Herein, on the basis of cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, isotope labeling, and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies, we demonstrate that an amorphous catalyst can be electrochemically activated to expose active sites in the bulk thanks to the short-range order of the amorphous structure, which greatly increases the number of active sites and thus improves the electrocatalytic activity of the amorphous catalyst in water oxidation.									101	4	0	0	4	1	102			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000541691200028	32391698

The nanochains comprise nanospheres connected to each other with a length of several micrometers. The amount of CoPx can be easily changed by varying the phosphorization time. In the Co@CoPx core-shell structure, Co serves as a conductive channel, which improves the reaction kinetics of the oxygen evolution process on CoPx. Co metal can also inject electrons into CoPx, thus changing the work function of CoPx and improving its oxygen evolution efficiency. Based on the optimized structure, the Co@CoPx nanochains catalyst exhibits excellent oxygen evolution performance. Co@CoPx achieves an overpotential of 310 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is lower than that of CoPx (418 mV), Co (408 mV), and RuO2 (317 mV). Furthermore, Co@CoPx exhibits good durability during the long-term electrochemical test.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2052-1553			WOS:000442606200011

Many types of catalysts have been developed to reduce high overpotential in OER, such as metal alloys, metal oxides, perovskite, or spinel. Nickel oxide (NiO) has high potential to increase OER activity according to volcano plots. The exact mechanisms for OER has not been discovered, but defects such as cation or anion vacancy typically act as an active site for diverse electrochemical reactions. In this study, nitrogen was doped into NiO by using ethylenediamine for formation of Ni vacancy, and the effects of N doping on OER activity and stability was studied.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0304-128X	2233-9558		WOS:000505225500014

Herein, a novel strategy has been demonstrated to achieve outstanding catalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), specifically removing interfacial charges through an optimized hybrid amorphous/crystalline FeNi (Oxy)hydroxides. Such hybrid structure offers an overpotential of only 215 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 50.9 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH, together with outstanding stability. The superior catalytic activity and stability can be attributed to the unique amorphous/crystalline microstructure, leading to optimized reactivity and excellent conductivity.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000477937300007

In this study, strontium barium titanate was synthesized and adopted as support of Au-based catalyst for OER. It was found that, the Au-based catalyst with a trace amount of Ba doping into strontium titanate as support (Au/Sr0.96Ba0.04TiO3) exhibited high OER catalytic activity, 4.8 times and 2.0 times higher than those obtained over Au/SrTiO3 and Au/BaTiO3, respectively. Energy level analysis indicated that Sr0.96Ba0.04TiO3 possessed suitable band positions, and the hot electrons transferred from Au to its conduction band owned moderate transfer rate and reduction potential, which ultimately resulted in high OER reaction rate. This study provides a simple way to promote the reaction rate of a catalyst in OER via doping method.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1566-7367	1873-3905		WOS:000405973200027

In the current scenario, oxygen production has grown tremendously due to its increasing demand from health sectors: the complexity, availability, and high cost of oxygen taken as a drawback. So, the development of an efficient, durable, and cost-effective oxygen production technology is necessary. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the process of generating molecular oxygen via a chemical reaction. Scientists now a days focus more on OER-based methods for portable device fabrication to generate breathable oxygen due to its economic and eco-friendly properties. In this article, we demonstrated the simple design and fabrication of an electrochemical-based oxygen evolution setup. The setup involves a plastic jar of (5 Litre) containing 1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) aqueous solution, and at the top portion, two holes were created for the immersion of the stainless-steel rod cathode and an anode electrode, which were connected to the power supply. The oxygen generation started in the bubbles form on the supply of voltage of 13V and 9.5A current. The produced oxygen is collected through the plastic tube. It also gives hydrogen, which can be separately stored. At the initial stage, the rate of oxygen production was 2.0 liter/min.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0019-5596	0975-1041		WOS:000674666100001

Seeking for highly efficient electrocatalysts to boost the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) which is the pivotal step of electrocatalysis is significant and challenging. Herein, we report a facile method to synthesize bimetallic (Fe/Ni) nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube, which is derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The optimized catalyst FeNi@OCNT achieves a low overpotential of 289 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 40.8 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH, and it exhibits long-term durability. Its excellent electrocatalytic performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect among the components, including bimetals, heteroatoms, carbon nanotubes and FeNi alloy nanoparticles. This work can provide a new idea in inspiring more strategies to synthesize high-performance and stable oxygen evolution reaction catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000700860100057

The hydrous oxide is considered as a porous assembly of interlinked octahedrally coordinated anionic metal oxyhydroxide surfaquo complexes which form an open network structure. The latter contains considerable quantities of water molecules which facilitate hydroxide ion discharge at the metal site during active oxygen evolution. The dynamics of redox switching has been quantified in terms of a diffusive frequency using the Laviron-Aoki diffusion model. Steady state Tafel plot analysis has been used to elucidate the kinetics and mechanism of oxygen evolution with slopes of ca. 60 mVdec(-1) and ca. 120 mVdec(-1) at low and high overpotentials respectively, whereas the reaction order with respect to hydroxide ion activity remains invariant at ca. 1.0 as the potential is increased. These observations are rationalized in terms of a kinetic scheme involving surfaquo groups. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical Society.

Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations are used to demonstrate partial Fe oxidation and a shortening of the Fe-O bond length during oxygen evolution on Co(Fe)OxHy. Cobalt oxidation during oxygen evolution is only observed in the absence of iron. These results demonstrate a different mechanism for water oxidation in the presence and absence of iron and support the hypothesis that oxidized iron species are involved in water-oxidation catalysis on Co(Fe)OxHy.									93	6	0	0	2	0	93			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000444941600041	30112793

Except of the discharge reaction mechanism, there is still a lack of a complete mechanistic picture for these fundamental issues. However, we are standing at the brink of connecting the single dots to draw the overall image. Neglect of double layer effects and nonlinearities has led us to stray from the path towards correct understanding of the charge transport. The current status of reaction sites reminds us of the parable of the blind and the elephant. Multiple in-situ, cross-validated methods and multiple working hypotheses are essential for a comprehensive understanding. More efforts, especially on identifying the reaction intermediates, are required to portray a unifying mechanistic scheme for the charge reaction mechanism.									17	1	0	0	0	0	18				2566-6223		WOS:000493566700003

Both ORRs and OERs suffer from sluggish kinetics and high overpotentials, and the bifunctional reactivity is limited by the scaling relationship.

Then the recent advances of precious-metal-free active materials and regulation methods of their intrinsic activity are introduced. The structural design principles to improve the accessibility of the active sites are further presented. Finally, a brief overview of the applications of bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts in Zn-air batteries, including routine liquid batteries and flexible solid-state batteries, is presented. This review affords rational design principles and strategies for nonprecious bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts, which are expected to guide the targeted optimization of electrocatalysts and further exploration of emerging candidates.									437	47	0	0	11	0	439			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000449887300001

The hybrid composite of N-doped graphene nanosheets with a high atomic percentage of nitrogen (8.2 at%) and embedded with highly distributed nickel/nickel oxide nanoparticles inside the graphene layers is synthesized by a one pot thermal annealing process. The resultant composite demonstrates excellent electrocatalytic activity utilizing the superior electrocatalytic properties of nickel/nickel oxide nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped graphene.

The electrochemical performances of newly designed carbon electrodes coated with 50 angstrom thick Au layer are evaluated and compared with those of unmodified electrodes. Despite the low noble metal content (similar to 2 wt.%), the Li-O-2 batteries built with the abovementioned Au-coated cathodes show considerably enhanced kinetics as demonstrated by the higher onset potentials for the oxygen reduction reaction (similar to 2.6 V at a current rate of 1000 mA g(-1)), together with reduced oxygen evolution potentials.

However, the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) severely limited the discharge charge efficiency. Herein, the single-atom Ru anchored N-doped reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (Ru-N/rGO) was fabricated via a simple impregnation method. When employed as cathode for Li-O-2 battery, the Ru-N/rGO delivers a higher discharge capacity, a lower overpotential and better rate performance in comparison with pure N-rGO without Ru atoms. Based on the in situ DEMS, the e(-)/O-2 ratio of Ru-N/rGO (2.08) is close to the theoretical value for the desired O-2 reduction to Li2O2 (2.00), suggesting the discharged product is mainly Li2O2. The density functional theory simulations reveal that the Ru single atoms offer high catalytic activity for OER and ORR.

In this work, highly dense, ultrathin Co-Ni boride nanoflakes supported on a 3 D CoNi skeleton are fabricated in situ by a simple one-step, high-temperature, solid-state boronation process. As a result of the induced high electroactive surface area and low charge transfer resistance, CoNiB-700 exhibits high catalytic activity at an overpotential of 262 (eta(10)) and 284 mV (eta(20)) to deliver current densities of 10 and 20 mA cm(-2), respectively, with a Tafel slope of 58 mV dec(-1) in an alkaline medium towards the oxygen evolution reaction. DFT calculations show that the Ni-regulated Co-B compound has a lower rate-determining energy barrier for the *OOH intermediate than the mono-Co-B compound, which facilitates the production of more active catalytic sites for an accelerated surface charge-transfer process for the oxygen evolution reaction.									19	2	0	0	2	0	21			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000537587900001	32329249

The new electrocatalyst was found to show greatly enhanced activity for both oxygen evolution and reduction. The apparent electrocatalytic activity of this electrode for oxygen reduction was more than 10 times higher than those reported for similar electrodes obtained by other methods. It was, however, observed to be less active electrocatalytically for oxygen evolution as compared to the active LaNiO3 electrode obtained by the Bockris-Otagawa coprecipitation method. The electrochemical reaction order with respect to OH- concentration was found to be approximately 1 in the case of oxygen evolution while that for oxygen reduction, was approximately -1.

Single-layer PtI2 is an indirect-gap semiconductor with a band gap of 2.56 eV, and its band gap is extremely robust against external strain. We find that it is a promising two-dimensional photocatalyst, exhibiting outstanding catalytic performances toward oxygen evolution reactions, with the water oxidation reaction occurring spontaneously under light irradiation. Moreover, we unveil that single-layer PtI2 is a long-sought auxetic material with a negative Poisson's ratio of -0.54, arising from its particular puckered hinge crystal.

A hydroxyl group is introduced on the second transition metal oxide. USE - A catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) used as an electrode catalyst for alkaline water electrolysis and water electrolysis system (all claimed). ADVANTAGE - External hydroxyl group is added to the second transition metal oxide to promote the water dissociation, and may optimize an energy level of cationic sites for adsorption-desorption of oxygen-containing intermediate. The active ingredient is integrated with the first transition metal matrix (e.g., copper) with weak hydrogen binding energy, thus, promoting the migration and coupling of hydride to improve rapid hydrogen formation. A hydrogen spillover channel is formed on a hetero-interface, so that the second transition metal oxide on the first transition metal matrix with weak hydrogen binding energy induces rapid hydrogen spillover and coupling, thus, ensuring the rapid release of hydrogen. The catalyst uses inexpensive non-precious metal elements. The preparation process may be simplified, mass production may be easy, and economic efficiency may be excellent.

J	Gao, Juan; Yu, Xin; Li, Yaxin; Ma, Yurong								Structural Fine-Tuning and In-situ Generation of P, O Vacancies in Hollow Co-Ferrocene-MOFs Derived Phosphides for Efficient Water Oxidation								CHEMCATCHEM											10.1002/cctc.202200558		SEP 2022			2022	As the high overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction seriously affect the efficiency of water splitting, catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction need further improvement by precise structural design and fine-tuning. In this study, hollow Co-Ferrocene-MOFs derived phosphides are synthesized successfully. Phase conversion and vacancies generation are realized simultaneously in our strategy. By the subtle regulation of doped Zn, metallic Co2P increases gradually in the mixed ConP crystal phases and abundant P, O vacancies generate in-situ. The synergistic effect of enriched P, O vacancies, metallic Co2P and the unique morphology endows catalysts with more reaction sites and high conductivity, leading to a remarkable catalytical performance. Zn doped CoFeP@NC with Co/Zn feeding ratio of 1 : 3 offers small overpotentials of 270 mV and 313 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. This study introduces a promising strategy for the synthesis of high efficiency catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000859251600001

Water electrolysis via the hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode coupled with the oxygen evolution reaction at the anode is a promising method to produce hydrogen. Given the shortage of freshwater resources on the planet, the direct use of seawater as an electrolyte for hydrogen production has become a hot research topic. Direct use of seawater as the electrolyte for water electrolysis can reduce the cost of hydrogen production due to the great abundance and wide availability. In recent years, various high-efficiency electrocatalysts have made great progress in seawater splitting and have shown great potential. This review introduces the mechanisms and challenges of seawater splitting and summarizes the recent progress of various electrocatalysts used for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction in seawater electrolysis in recent years. Finally, the challenges and future opportunities of seawater electrolysis for hydrogen and oxygen production are presented.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2073-4344		WOS:000778580000001

For each of the half reactions of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), multiple protons and electrons must be coupled to avoid high-energy intermediates. To understand the mechanistic details of the PCET chemistry that underpins HER and OER, we have designed hangman porphyrin and corrole catalysts. In these hangman constructs, a pendant acid/base functionality within the secondary coordination sphere is "hung" above the macrocyclic redox platform on which substrate binds. The two critical thermodynamic properties of a PCET event, the redox potential and pK(a) may be tuned with the macrocycle and hanging group, respectively. This review outlines the synthesis of these catalysts, as well as the examination of the PCET kinetics of hydrogen and oxygen evolution by the hangman catalysts. The insights provided by these systems provide a guide for the design of future HER and OER catalysts that use a secondary coordination sphere to manage PCET.									32	1	0	0	6	0	33			1088-4246	1099-1409		WOS:000352644100002

The present method for Ni SACs starts with graphite foil and is capable of achieving ultrafast preparation (1.5 min) and mass production. The defective oxygen featuring the strong electronegativity enables primarily attracting Ni2+ ions and stabilizing Ni atoms via Ni-O-6 coordination instead of conventional metal-C or metal-N. In addition, the oxygen defects for trapping are tunable through altering the applied voltage or electrolyte, further altering the loading of Ni atoms, indicative of enhanced oxygen evolution activity. This simple and ultrafast electrochemical synthesis is promising for the mass and controllable production of oxygen-coordinated Ni SACs, which exhibit good performance for oxygen evolution reaction.									11	2	0	0	1	0	11			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000576958900054	32816450

Herein, combining the surface activation with the heterostructure construction strategy, the CoP/Fe-Co9S8 heterostructures as the pre-catalyst for highly efficient oxygen evolution are successfully synthesized. The catalyst only needs 156 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) and keeps stable for more than 150 h. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, in situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations verify that the introduction of Fe can promote the formation of highly active Co(IV)-O sites and lead to a self-termination of surface reconstruction, which eventually creates a highly active and stable oxygen evolution catalytic surface. Besides, the catalyst also demonstrates high hydrogen evolution reaction activity with an overpotential of 62 mV@10 mA cm(-2). Benefiting from its bifunctionality and self-supporting property, the membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer equipped with these catalysts achieves high overall water splitting efficiency of 1.68 V@1 A cm(-2).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2198-3844		WOS:000870837900001	36270971

Currently, noble metals and metal oxides are the most widely used catalysts for electrocatalysis. However, metal-based catalysts often suffer from multiple disadvantages, including high cost, low selectivity, poor durability, impurity poisoning and fuel crossover effects, and detrimental effects on the environment. Therefore, carbon-based metal-free catalysts have received increasing interest as promising electrocatalysts for advanced energy conversion and storage. Recently, tremendous progress has been achieved in the development of low-cost, efficient carbon-based metal-free catalysts for renewable energy technologies and beyond. Here, a concise, but comprehensive and critical, review of recent advances in the field of carbon-based metal-free catalysts is provided. A brief overview of various reactions involved in renewable energy conversion and storage, including the oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, and bifunctional/multifunctional electrocatalysis, along with some challenges and opportunities, is presented.									207	20	0	0	5	0	209			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000460183000014	30461095

In this work, an earthly abundant and cheap biomass of tobacco-stem was used to prepare a novel porous carbon framework (NiCo@N-C) by incorporating transition metal alloy and nitrogen-rich small molecules. The resultant catalyst affords an onset potential of 0.92 V and a half-wave potential of 0.86 V for oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline media, which is better than commercial Pt/C. Besides, the catalyst also exhibits good oxygen evolution reaction performance with a low overpotential of 280 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2), and the potential gap between ORR and OER is only 0.65 V. The incorporation of NiCo alloy and N heteroatom modulates the electronic structure of the prepared carbon frameworks, creates abundant active sites, and improves charge redistribution, thus resulting in faster ORR and OER reaction kinetics. The applicability of the prepared NiCo@N-C is fully harnessed for use as an air-cathode in a Zn-air battery. This work creates a platform for developing efficient porous and functionalized biomass-derived oxygen electrocatalysts for energy applications. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The doped Fe in Ni2P is essential for a substantial increase in intrinsic catalytic activity, while the combined N,P-containing porous carbon matrix with a better degree of graphitization endows the prepared Fe-Ni2P@N,P-CNSs catalyst with a high specific surface area and improved electrical conductivity. Benefiting from the specific chemical composition and designed active site structure, the as-synthesized Fe-Ni2P@N,P-CNSs manifests a satisfying catalytic performance toward both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline solution, with low overpotential, small Tafel slope and long-term durability, relative to the counterparts (Fe-free Ni12P5/Ni2P2O7@N,P-CNSs and CNSs) with single components and even comparable to Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts.

However, the electrocatalytic behaviors of pristine phosphorous single-doped carbon catalysts toward the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER) are rarely investigated and their corresponding active species are not yet explored. To clearly ascertain the effects of phosphorous doping on the OER and HER and identify the active sites, herein, phosphorous unitary-doped graphite layers with different phosphorous species distributions are prepared and the correlations between the oxygen or hydrogen evolution activity and different phosphorous species are investigated, respectively. Results indicate that phosphorous single-doped graphite layers show a superior oxygen evolution activity to most of the reported OER catalysts and the commercial IrO2 in alkaline medium, and comparable hydrogen evolution activity to most reported carbon catalysts in acidic medium. Moreover, the relevancies unveil that the C-O-P species are the main OER active species, and the defects derived from the decomposition of C-3-P = O species are the main active sites for HER, as evidenced by density functional theory calculations, showing a new perspective for the design of more effective phosphorous-containing water-splitting catalysts.									33	1	0	0	1	0	33			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000511517300001

J	Wang, Yanning; Zhou, Na; Li, Yinshi								Electrochemical catalytic mechanism of single transition metal atom embedded BC3 monolayer for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				425						130631	10.1016/j.cej.2021.130631		JUN 2021		DEC 1 2021	2021	The graphene embedded with single transition metal (TM) atom shows great potential to replace precious metals as the electrochemical catalyst of fuel cells and metal-air batteries. However, the electrochemical catalytic mechanism of single TM atom supported on other substrates is less well understood. Herein, a density functional theory calculation of single 3d TM atom embedded on two-dimensional BC3 as an active site for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is performed. The electronic structure analysis reveals that the hybridized antibonding orbitals formed by TM-3d and O-2p orbitals possess lower energy level and higher occupancy, weakening the interaction between OH and TM, further determines the catalytic activity of TM-N-4 active site. Among all considered active sites, the Fe-N-4 and Mn-N-4 sites show the best ORR catalytic performance while Co-N-4 site shows the best OER catalytic performance. Finally, an adsorption factor is put forward via the coordination environment around TM atom to provide a guidance on the exploration of new high-performance single atom catalysts family.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000707126000096

Before evaluation, the electrodeposited samples were subjected to a variety of thermal and electrochemical conditioning procedures, which generated unique initial catalyst structures and crystallinities. During oxygen evolution, Ni-modified CoOxHy films having lower initial crystallinity underwent substantial structural evolution that began with an irreversible transformation of a spinel local structure to an amorphous CoO structure at low anodic potentials (0.2 V vs Ag/AgCl). Increasing anodic polarization to greater than 0.3 V vs Ag/AgCl facilitated additional structural conversion from the amorphous CoO structure to a complex phase best described as an amalgamation of NiOOH and layered CoO2 motifs (NiOOH-h-CoO2) under elevated oxygen evolution rates. The formation of this NiOOH-h-CoO2 active structure was correlated with improved OER activity, which at 0.35 V overpotential is 100% greater than that of the catalyst where Ni was coordinated in a spinel structure. Independent of the initial cobalt oxide structure, the same NiOOH-h-CoO2 structure was formed during oxygen evolution, which suggests the active phase identified herein could be the universally active structure for NiCoOxHy materials.									107	7	0	0	5	0	109			2155-5435			WOS:000424735000064

This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary on the recent development of such single-atom electrocatalysts (SAECs) for various energy-conversion reactions. The discussion starts with an introduction of the different types of SAECs, followed by an overview of the synthetic methodologies to control the atomic dispersion of metal sites and atomically resolved characterization using state-of-the-art microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. In recognition of the extensive applications of SAECs, the electrocatalytic studies are dissected in terms of various important electrochemical reactions, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Examples of SAECs are deliberated in each case in terms of their catalytic performance, structure-property relationships, and catalytic enhancement mechanisms. A perspective is provided at the end of each section about remaining challenges and opportunities for the development of SAECs for the targeted reaction.									253	11	0	0	5	0	253			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000588271100010	33136387

Transition metal sulfides have been established as an excellent hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst but their oxygen evolution reaction behaviour is still little explored and needs further investigations. The oxygen evolution reaction has huge potential for fuel cell and metal-air battery applications. Herein MoS2 nanolayers having interlayer spacing were hierarchically grown over N-doped carbon wrapped cobalt nanospheres derived from a cobalt-based metal-organic framework. The catalyst Co@NC@MoS2 has a low overpotential of 297 mV vs. RHE at a 10 mA cm(-2) current density. The catalyst has long term stability with a Tafel slope value of 70 mV dec(-1). A chronoamperometric study for more than 10 hours does not show any significant change in the current density of the catalyst.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2398-4902			WOS:000616375400016

In this work, cobalt, nitrogen-codoped carbon was prepared by a facile one-step method and demonstrated to exhibit good electrocatalytic performance for ORR and OER via a complete four-electron process. Besides, the catalyst prepared at 900 degrees C also displayed excellent stability for both ORR and OER. Furthermore, the origin of catalytic activity was also explored, which was attributed to the synergistic effects of metallic Co and quaternary N.									48	18	0	0	11	0	48			2095-9273	2095-9281		WOS:000369368400011

Here, we realized efficient OER catalysts fabricated using relatively cheap precursors consisting of earth-abundant metal oxides, i.e. nickel, iron, and chromium, and a simple one-step preparation method. It is shown that the catalyst is activated by anodic polarization under irradiation with visible light, which allows decreasing the overpotential necessary for the OER.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0942-9352			WOS:000528279600005

In this study, CoFe2O4 nanoparticles anchored on nitrogen and sulfur co-doped mesoporous carbon spheres (CFO/NS-MCS) were prepared as nonprecious metal catalysts, using a facile pyrolysis and hydrothermal treatment process. The co-doping of N and S into the carbon spheres was achieved using thiourea, which played a key role in the bimetallic covalent coupling in the NS-MCS. The as-prepared CFO/NS-MCS exhibited a more promising ORR catalytic performance compared with that of commercial Pt/C, which was attributed to the presence of highly active sites. Remarkably, the CFO/NS-MCS catalysts also showed a high OER catalytic performance comparable with that of commercial RuO2/C in the aspects of onset potential and Tafel slope, and showed a better durability for oxygen catalytic reactions in an alkaline solution. The approach indicated in this research can be applied to develop high-performance electrocatalysts for practical implementation in energy storage and conversion devices.

However, the lack of deep insight into the reaction mechanisms and clear identification of the catalytic active sites hinder any breakthrough for the development of efficient electrocatalysts with high performance and durability. Operando characterization techniques allowing in situ monitoring the surface oxidation state and local atomic-structure transformation are capable of probing the active sites and promoting the fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanism in these systems. Herein, the recent applications of various operando characterization techniques in identifying the active sites and capturing the geometric structure, oxidation state, and local atomic-structure evolution of the catalysts during water electrolysis and O-2/CO2 electroreduction are thoroughly summarized. The challenges and outlook in developing operando techniques to further extend the understanding of the underlying mechanism during electrochemical energy-conversion reactions are discussed.									87	8	0	0	4	1	89			2366-9608			WOS:000434982200006

Here, a valence engineering strategy is devised to construct a morphology with polyvalent cobalt encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (Co/N-CNFs). The diverse cobalt valence states of the Co/N-CNF catalysts contribute to their excellent catalytic effect and high durability in multiple electrochemical processes. The optimal Co/N-CNF catalyst fabricated exhibits a high half-wave potential of ORR (0.86 V) and low overpotentials of OER (380 mV) and HER (241 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2). The Co/N-CNF-based Zn-air battery possesses a high charge-discharge efficiency as well as a good cycle stability (50 h at 10 mA cm(-2) and 120 h at 20 mA cm(-2)), much superior to the Pt/C-based batteries. Furthermore, the Co/N-CNF catalyst could perform efficient overall water splitting.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000743217000001	35014796

The two materials are isostructural and consist of (Fe/Mn)O-5 square-pyramidal units that form two-dimensional layers, separated by strontium ions. This structure type is related to the so-called Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) structure, which typically contains 7 oxygens per formula unit and consists of octahedrally coordinated transition metals. The two materials in this work can be described as oxygen-deficient RP systems. Both compounds show electrocatalytic activity for OER and HER, with Sr3FeMnO6 having a significantly greater performance compared to Sr3Mn2O6. The overpotential required for both OER and HER is considerably lowered for Sr3FeMnO6. This material also shows faster reaction kinetics and greater electrochemically active surface area compared to Sr3Mn2O6. While the activity of Sr3FeMnO6 does not reach those of state-of-the-art catalysts, its bifunctional electrocatalytic performance is remarkable. In addition, it demonstrates the important role of electronegativity in directing functional properties such as electrocatalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000784142100001

Herein, sulfur was introduced to partly occupy oxygen location in the surface structure of cobalt (II) oxide. The heterogenous 'O-Co-S' sites brought an enhanced oxygen evolution activity, including a five-fold intrinsic activity improvement and a reduced overpotential of 66 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the electronegativity difference between sulfur and oxygen induce the Co 3d electron accumulation along the Co-O bond. This orientated distortion optimizes the adsorption behaviors to oxygen-containing species and also favors energy band more continuous to promote electron transfer, thereby leading to improved electrochemical performance. This work provides the atomic-level understanding of the nature of active sites, which would shed light on the rational design and regulation of other material systems for advanced energy storage and conversion devices.									26	1	0	0	3	0	26			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000471201800032

Here, we report a total internal reflection imaging sensor without background current interference to map local current distribution of the electrode in a vanadium redox flow battery during cyclic voltammetry (CV), enabling mapping of the activity and reversibility distribution with the spatial resolution of a single fiber. Three graphite felts with different activity are compared to verify its feasibility. In long-term cyclic voltammetry, the oxygen evolution reaction is proved to enhance activity distribution, and homogeneity of the electrode and its bubble kinetics with periodic fluctuation is consistent with the cyclic voltammetry curve, enabling the onset oxygen evolution/reduction potential determination. Higher activity and irreversibility distribution of the electrode is found in favor of the oxygen evolution reaction.

Herein, we, for the first time, have obtained porous Co-x,O-y nanosheets with N-doping and oxygen vacancies by etching Co3O4 nanosheets with NH3 plasma. Comparing with the pristine Co3O4 nanosheets (1.79 V), the porous CoxOy nanosheets with N-doping and oxygen vacancies have a much lower potential of 1.51 V versus RHE to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The obtained sample has a lower Tafel slope of 68 mV dec(-1) than the pristine Co3O4 nanosheets (234 mV dec(-1)). The disclosed Co2+, which is responsible for the formation of active sites (CoOOH), N-doping and oxygen vacancies, gives rise to better performance of OER.

High-temperature superconductors have been intensively studied at the end of the 20th century owing to their unique electrical behaviour; nonetheless, we wish to show their interesting electrocatalytic properties as well. This work seeks to investigate the feasibility of two high-temperature superconductors, YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) and Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 (BSCCO) in catalysing the hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions electrochemically. These materials can be easily synthesized by solid state reactions and this in combination with the fairly impressive electrocatalytic properties displayed in our study, mean that they definitely possess the potential to replace platinum as prospective electrocatalysts.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000352489200018

Herein, low-loading of Iridium (Ir) (approximate to 2.3 wt%) decorated cobalt nano- particles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube/porous carbon sheets (IrCo@NCNT/PC) is prepared to serve as the OER/HER/ORR trifunctional electrocatalyst. The resulting composites demonstrate excellent OER and HER activity in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes, including low overpotentials at 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)) for OER (about 291 and 240 mV) and HER (about 26.8 and 37 mV), respectively, which are superior to the benchmarking Pt/C and IrO2 catalysts. Hence, low cell voltages of 1.51 and 1.45 V are required at j = 10 mA cm(-2) (j(10)) for overall water splitting (OWS) in the acidic and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. In addition, the as-prepared IrCo@NCNT/PC also shows efficient ORR performance with a high half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.83 V vs. RHE. It is then used as the air cathode for rechargeable Zn-air battery (r-ZAB), and exhibits an outstanding specific capacity (810 mAh g(-1)), low charge-discharge polarization (Delta E = 0.896 V at j = 50 mA cm(-2)) and long cycling performance (increased only 0.15 V after 195 cycles).									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000724574400001

They allow for the formation of new and tailorable active sites in multiple elements adjacent to each other, and the interaction can be tailored by rational selection of element configuration and composition. However, it needs to be further explored in catalyst design, the interaction of elements, and the determination of active sites. This review article focuses on the important progress for multi-sites electrocatalysis in HEAs. The classification is done on the basis of catalytic reaction, including hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, alcohol oxidation reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, and nitrogen reduction reaction. Based on experiments and theories, a more in-depth exploration of the high catalytic activity of HEAs will be conducted, including the selection of elements (the special role of each element in catalysis) and the multi-sites effect. This review can provide the basis for the element selection and design of HEAs in some reactions, to adjust the compositions of HEAs to improve their intrinsic activity. Furthermore, the remaining challenges and future directions for promising research fields are also provided.									30	1	0	0	2	0	30			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000688520300001

Here, we demonstrate a versatile partial cation exchange method to fabricate lamellar Ag-CoSe2 nanobelts with controllable conductivity. The electrical conductivity of the materials was significantly enhanced by the addition of Ag+ cations of less than 1.0%. Moreover, such a trace amount of Ag induced a negligible loss of active sites which was compensated through the effective generation of active sites as shown by the excellent conductivity. Both the enhanced conductivity and the retained active sites contributed to the remarkable electrocatalytic performance of the Ag-CoSe2 nanobelts. Relative to the CoSe2 nanobelts, the as-prepared Ag-CoSe2 nanobelts exhibited a higher current density and a lower Tafel slope towards OER. This strategy represents a rational design of efficient electrocatalysts through finely tuning their electrical conductivities.									151	9	0	0	6	0	151			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000394861200051	27897364

Herein, single-atomic Mo sites are anchored on Ni-Fe oxyhydroxide nanoarrays by a facile metal-organic-framework-derived strategy, exhibiting superior performance toward the OER in alkaline media. In situ electrochemical spectroscopy and isotope-labeling experiments reveal the involvement of lattice oxygen during OER cycles. Combining theoretical and experimental investigations of the electronic configuration, it is comprehensively confirmed that the incorporation of single-atomic Mo sites enables higher oxidation state of the metal and strengthened metal-oxygen hybridization, as well as the formation of oxidized ligand holes above the Fermi level. In a word, the considerable acceleration of water oxidation is achieved via enhancing the reactivity of lattice oxygen and triggering the lattice oxygen activation. This work may provide new insights for designing ideal electrocatalysts via tuning the chemical state and activating the anions ligands.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000807103100001	35577533

NiCo2O4 worked as a novel oxygen-evolution-reaction cocatalyst, and the intimate interface combination by surface bonding and the related cooperative effect between NiCo2O4 and g-C3N4 were comprehensively explored. Consequently, the separation and migration of photo-generated charge carriers for g-C3N4 were efficiently promoted, as well as the energy barriers of the oxygen evolution reaction were reduced. NiCo2O4/g-C3N4 showed obviously enhanced photocatalytic O-2-evolution activity (4.6 times that of bare g-C3N4), and the corresponding AQY achieved 4.9% at 380 nm. Then, Pt as a hydrogen-evolution-reaction cocatalyst was employed to cooperate with NiCo2O4 to construct dual cocatalyst loaded g-C3N4 for photocatalytic overall water splitting, in which H-2 and O-2 simultaneously evolved in a stoichiometric ratio of 2 : 1, and the AQY for H-2 evolution reached 2.8% at 380 nm. Consequently, this work demonstrates a reliable strategy for g-C3N4 to construct a photocatalytic system for efficient overall water splitting.									51	2	0	0	1	0	51			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000651132300001

In this work, we demonstrate a novel composite of Co2P particles anchored in cobalt, nitrogen and phosphorus co-doped graphene nanosheets (Co2P@CoNPG) prepared via supramolecular gel-assisted strategy. In virtue of the positive synergistic effect originating from the Co2P, Co-Nx active sites and N/P co-functionalized graphene in the composite, the optimized Co2P@CoNPG-900 exhibits superior bifunctional activities and strong durability for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline solution. The value of DE (bifunctional performance parameter) for Co2P@CoNPG-900 is only 0.92 V. Compared to the noble metal-based catalysts, Co2P@CoNPG-900 has the obvious advantages in durability and bifunctional activities. The integration of Co2P and multielement codoped graphene into a hybrid material is a new and promising strategy to design bifunctional oxygen electrode catalysts for renewable energy technologies.

Ni meshes surface coated with porous-nickel layers have been used as substrates for electrodes. Porous nickel coatings have been modified by amorphous NiPx or Pt nanoparticles (to improve the cathode efficiency) and nickel cobalt spinels (to improve the anode efficiency). The structure, roughness and composition of the active layers have been determined by SEM analysis, porosimetry, laser atomic emission spectroscopy (LASS), energy-dispersion analysis (EDA) and XRD analysis. Overpotentials for both HER and OER have been measured in 6 M KOH over the 0-1.0 A/cm(2) current density range. Both hydrogen and oxygen overpotentials are found significantly reduced compared to smooth nickel electrodes. The hydrogen and oxygen evolution mechanisms on these catalytic surfaces are discussed.

The phase,morphology,microstructure and pore-size distribution of nanoporous Ni and NiO were analyzed by XRD,SEM,TEM,BET respectively.The electrochemical performance was investigated by cyclic voltammetry,electrochemical steady-state polarization and electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS). The results showed that nanoporous Ni could be obtained after de-alloying of Ni_(15)Al_(85) and Ni_5Al_(95) alloy. The bore diameter and skeleton strength of Ni decreased as the Al content increased. Under the current density of 10 mA·cm~(-2),oxygen evolution reaction overpotential of nanoporous Ni drove from Ni_5Al_(95) alloy was 95 mV lower than nanoporous Ni from Ni_(15)Al_(85) alloy. However,with the reaction proceeded,collapse and detachment of the surface holes reduced the stability of oxygen evolution. NiO inherited the nanoporous structure of Ni,and further increased the specific surface area and skeleton strength of the electrode. Under the current density of 10 mA·cm~(-2),oxygen evolution reaction overpotential of nanoporous NiO electrode was only 357 mV,which lower than Ni electrode 14.3 mV. The apparent exchange current density of NiO electrode toward the OER was 1.2 times as high as that of nickel electrode in room temperature, the apparent activation energy reduced 8.59 kJ·mol~(-1),after 1 000 cycles,overpotential of NiO minished 12 mV (J =100 mA·cm~(-2)),nanoporous NiO drove from Ni_5Al_(95) alloy had superior electrocatalytic properties toward the oxygen evolution reaction and favorable stability.			采用快速凝固与脱合金化相结合的方法制备纳米多孔Ni,经热处理氧化获得纳米多孔NiO,运用XRD、SEM、TEM、BET等对纳米多孔Ni、NiO的物相、形貌结构、孔径分布进行表征,并通过循环伏安、稳态极化、电化学阻抗法研究了其作为电极的电催化析氧性能。结果表明,Ni_(15)Al_(85)和Ni_5Al_(95)脱合金化后均获得了纳米多孔Ni,Al含量的增加使得Ni的孔径尺寸与骨架强度减小,Ni_5Al_(95)形成的纳米多孔Ni在10 mA·cm~(-2)电流密度下的析氧过电位比Ni_(15)Al_(85)形成的纳米多孔Ni低95 mV,但随着反应的进行,纳米多孔Ni表面的孔洞开始坍塌和脱落,导致其析氧稳定性降低。 NiO继承了Ni的纳米多孔结构,比表面积和骨架强度进一步增大,Ni_5Al_(95)合金获得的纳米多孔NiO在10 mA·cm~(-2)电流密度下的析氧过电位仅为357 mV,相比Ni电极降低了14.3 mV,室温下析氧反应的表观交换电流密度是Ni电极的1.2倍,表观活化自由能降低了8.59 kJ·mol~(-1),经1 000圈循环伏安后过电位降低了12 mV(J =100 mA·cm~(-2)),具有优良的电催化析氧性能和良好的稳定性。						1	1	0	0	0	0	2			1005-023X			CSCD:6575082

J	Berndt, D; Teutsch, U								Float charging of valve-regulated lead-acid batteries: A balancing act between secondary reactions								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				143	3			790	798		10.1149/1.1836539				MAR 1996	1996	The behavior of valve-regulated lead-acid batteries on float charging is influenced by many interacting parameters. A mathematical model has been developed that describes the effects of kinetic cell parameters, float voltage (or current), and temperature on electrode potentials and rates of electrode reactions. The considered reactions are: hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, oxygen reduction, grid corrosion, and discharge of active material that may occur under unfavorable conditions. This model, combined with selected experiments, is a very effective tool for surveying the complex situation during float charging. It can also be applied to vented batteries. With model simulations, some fundamental relationships have been shown: when the oxygen reduction efficiency is near 100%, the kinetics of hydrogen evolution and grid corrosion govern electrode polarization at specified float conditions. To achieve a long service life, the rates of waterless and grid disintegration have to be small, and simultaneously a satisfactory state of charge of the battery is required. Hence, the optimum design of a valve-regulated battery requires a high and balanced hindrance of hydrogen evolution and grid corrosion. Furthermore, small rates of oxygen evolution are favorable. Oxygen intake from the surroundings by a leakage may cause discharge of the negative electrodes. The model helps to estimate the maximum size of such a leakage that can be tolerated. Temperature has not only a marked effect on all the reaction rates, but also influences electrode polarization and the delicate balance of currents, because the activation energies of the various processes differ.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			0013-4651			WOS:A1996UC20300012

The substantial progress in operando characterization, particularly using synchrotron based X-ray spectroscopies, provides the unprecedented opportunity to uncover surface chemical and structural transformations under various (electro)chemical reaction environments. In this work, we study a polycrystalline platinum surface under oxygen evolution conditions in an alkaline electrolyte by means of ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy performed at the electrified solid/liquid interface. We elucidate previously inaccessible aspects of the surface chemistry and structure as a function of the applied potential, allowing us to propose a reaction mechanism for oxygen evolution on a platinum electrode in alkaline solutions.									71	3	0	0	3	0	72			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000403228200020		
J	Li, Yurong; Guo, Qifei; Jiang, Yimin; Shen, Wei; Li, Ming; He, Rongxing								A novel ball-in-ball hollow oxygen-incorporating cobalt sulfide spheres as high-efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction								CHINESE CHEMICAL LETTERS				32	2			755	760		10.1016/j.cclet.2020.05.012		MAR 2021		FEB 2021	2021	Transition-metal chalcogenides with hollow nanostructure, especially cobalt sulfides, are considered as the most promising non-precious metal catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction. However, it is difficult to synthesize oxygen-containing cobalt sulphides with hollow structure due to the different physical/chemical properties between metal sulfides and metal cobalts. Herein, we report a novel oxygen-containing amorphous cobalt sulfide ball-in-ball hollow spheres (Co-S-O BBHS) synthesized by an anion exchange method. Taking advantage of the ball-in-ball hollow structure, the amorphous Co-S-O BBHS shows superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 285 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), small Tafel slope of 49.67 mV/dec, high Faraday efficiency of 96%, and satisfied durability. Experiments and DFT calculations demonstrate that the introduction of oxygen and sulfur modulates the electronic structure of Co-S-O BBHS, thus enhancing the adsorption of *O (adsorbed O species on catalyst surface) intermediate, which greatly boosts the catalytic activity towards OER. This work provides a new strategy for controllable synthesis of complex hollow structures of transition-metal chalcogenides for OER.

Electrode materials resisting the corrosion of electrolytes in the full pH range are attracting the attention of the research community, which can adapt to more complicated conditions and significantly reduce expenditure. Accordingly, considerable efforts have been made to upgrade the availability of pH-universal electrode materials. Ruthenium-based materials with prominent activity, pH-universal window, cheaper price, etc. have been universally acknowledged to be the feasible alternative to platinum. Herein, the recent knowledge of the Ru-based electrocatalysts toward HER, OER, and overall water splitting across all pH conditions, including reaction mechanism, construction of advanced electrocatalysts, and regulation strategy of activity is focused. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects are highlighted, aiming to guide the design and synthesis of the universal pH-stable Ru-based electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000844802200001

The initial oxygen-evolving catalytic activities of C1 and C2 were higher than that of C0 in both a chemical reaction driven by the strong oxidant (NH4)(2)[Ce(NO3)(6)] (CAN = ceric ammonium nitrate) and photochemical oxidation using a [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) photosensitizer with Na2S2O8 as the sacrificial oxidant. The higher activities were ascribed to the electron-withdrawing cbz groups, which promoted the radical coupling reaction to form a Ru-IV-O-O-Ru-IV species. A unique oxygen-evolution rate change behaviour was observed for both C1 and C2 in the presence of a large excess of CAN, suggesting the competitive oxidation of the cbz moiety during the chemical oxygen evolution reaction. This work suggests that the cbz modification of an oxygen evolution molecular catalyst is a promising approach for integrating the hole accumulator near the oxygen evolution catalytic centre.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000714123300001	34730158

Through ab initio thermodynamic approach, the relationship between catalyst surface structure and pH, electrode potential was studied. For the most stable state of the catalyst surfaces, three adsorbing oxygen atoms and one Ni vacancy form. Doped iron decreases the formation energy of Ni vacancy thus increasing the stable range of surface states. OER mechanism was explored based on the obtained most stable structures. The first step of the reaction is the desorption of oxygen rather than the formation of *OH due to large Steric effects. Ni vacancy reduces the dehydrogenation energy of the adsorbate *OOH and the formation energy of oxygen radical. The interaction between iron and oxygen atom is large than the Ni and oxygen. Therefore, Fe-doped system reduces the formation energy of *O and changes the potential-limited step from the formation of adsorbate *O to the desorption of O-2.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2468-8231			WOS:000555573300031

However, both reactions suffer from sluggish kinetics. The availability of efficient electrocatalysts that could conquer activation energy barriers and accelerate reaction rates is crucial to tackling this issue. The noble metal-based electrocatalysts (e.g., Pt/C and Ru/IrO2) cannot meet the requirement for large-scale applications due to their scarce abundance, high cost, and insufficient stability. Transition metal-based materials can be a sustainable and promising candidate to replace the noble metal-based electrocatalysts for this purpose. This review intends to review the most recent, high performance, and sustainable strategies on tuning the catalytic activity of the transition metal-based materials toward ORR and OER. We also propose perspectives on remaining challenges and future research directions of transition metal-based bifunctional electrocatalysts toward practical applications. These fundamental design principles and strategies are crucial to guide and accelerate the design of the ideal catalysts and make possible the practical applications of MABs.

Employing model catalysts, which have well-defined molecular structures and coordination environments, to investigate electrocatalytic performance of M-N-4/C sites for ORR and OER is of fundamental significance. Herein, we reported the use of Co tetra (phenyl)porphyrin 1 and Co tetra(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin 2 as models to probe the role of Co-N-4/C sites for oxygen electrocatalysis. We showed that Co porphyrin 1 is more efficient than its structural analogue 2 for oxygen electrocatalysis in alkaline aqueous solutions, indicating that the electron rich Co-N-4/C site is more favored when noncovalently adsorbed on carbon supports.

Herein, we report iridium clusters stabilized surface reconstructed oxyhydroxides on amorphous metal borides array, achieving an ultralow overpotential of 178 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER in alkaline medium. The coupling of iridium clusters induced the formation of high valence cobalt species and Ir-O-Co bridge between iridium and oxyhydroxides at the atomic scale, engineering lattice oxygen activation and non-concerted proton-electron transfer to trigger multiple active sites for intrinsic pH-dependent OER activity. The lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) was confirmed by in situ O-18 isotope labeling mass spectrometry and chemical recognition of negative peroxo-like species. Theoretical simulations reveal that the OER performance on this catalyst is intrinsically dominated by LOM pathway, facilitating the reaction kinetics. This work not only paves an avenue for the rational design of electrocatalysts, but also serves the fundamental insights into the lattice oxygen participation for promising OER application.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000719392600001	34626056

However, it requires efficient catalysts to overcome the large overpotentials in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report a novel heterostructure catalyst Co9S8/Cu2S on copper foam (Co9S8/Cu2S/CF) with multistep impregnation and electrodeposition. Due to the strong interfacial interaction, the interfacial electrons transfer from Co sites to S sites, which promote the adsorption of oxygen-containing intermediates, water molecules, as well as the dissociation of water molecules. Therefore, the heterostructure catalyst exhibits low overpotentials of 195 mV for OER and 165 mV for HER at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, it only needs 1.6 V to realize water splitting at 10 mA cm(-2) in a two-electrode cell. This work provides an efficient method to tailor the surface electronic structure through specific morphological design and construct a heterostructure interface to achieve alkaline water splitting.									41	2	0	0	0	0	42			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000626502700042	33594893

Currently, state-of-the-art electrocatalysts of Pt and IrO2/RuO2 exhibit the benchmark catalytic activity toward HER and OER, respectively. However, expanding their practical application is hindered by their exorbitant price and scarcity. Therefore, the development of alternative effective electrocatalysts for water splitting is crucial. In the last few decades, substantial effort has been devoted to the development of alternative HER/OER and water splitting catalysts based on various transition metals (including Fe, Co, Ni, Mo, and atomic Pt) which show promising catalytic activities and durability. In this review, after a brief introduction and basic mechanism of HER/OER, the authors systematically discuss the recent progress in design, synthesis, and application of single atom and cluster-based HER/OER and water splitting catalysts. Moreover, the crucial factors that can tune the activity of catalysts toward HER/OER and water splitting such as morphology, crystal defects, hybridization of metals with nonmetals, heteroatom doping, alloying, and formation of metals inside graphitic layered materials are discussed. Finally, the existing challenges and future perspectives for improving the performance of electrocatalysts for water splitting are addressed.									315	21	0	0	10	0	318			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000471132800007

La2O3/NiFe-NCNTs revealed desirable bifunctional catalytic activities towards both oxygen reduction reaction (5.1 mA cm(-2) at 0.3 V vs. RHE) and oxygen evolution reaction (1.69 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2)) in alkaline media. Furthermore, rechargeable zinc-air batteries fabricated with La2O3/NiFe-NCNTs as the bifunctional catalyst demonstrated a small charge-discharge voltage gap (1.04 V) and long-term stability after charge-discharge cycling for 100 cycles.

In this regard, one topic that has not been explored in depth, is the corrosion of catalytic layers under on/off operation in alkaline media during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anode. Here, we studied the corrosion of, and changes to, the catalytic layer on stainless steel (SS) electrodes under different surface treatments.

Herein, a ceria (CeO2) modified reduced graphene oxide (CeO2/rGO) nanocomposite was fabricated via a facile yet costeffective method under a mild condition. The prepared CeO2/rGO nanocomposite showed remarkable catalytic activity, high tolerance to methanol and durability toward ORR in alkaline media. Meanwhile, the catalyst also displayed remarkable activity for the OER with more negative onset potential and higher current compared with commercial Pt/ C catalyst. The high oxygen reaction activity of the catalyst could contribute to synergistic effect of the combination of the oxygen vacancies of CeO2 and excellent electronic conductivity of rGO. The results suggested that the CeO2/rGO nanocomposite has potential advantages as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in the practical applications. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In this study, based on a series of single transition metal atom anchored graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN) monolayer (TM@g-CN, TM = Fe-Cu, Ru-Ag), possible multifunctional electrocatalysts are screened out by using the density functional method. Our results demonstrated that Pd@g-CN is an excellent trifunctional catalyst with small overpotentials of 0.41/0.19/-0.28 V for ORR/OER/HER.

Understanding how water is electrochemically converted to oxygen is key to the development of high-performance electrocatalysts that can enable energy storage technologies based on water to hydrogen fuel generation. The use of well-defined metal oxide systems allows for the isolation of spatial reactivity in bulk redox conversion and oxygen evolution reactions. Herein, we investigate the electrochemical reactivity of well-faceted single-crystalline beta-Co(OH)(2) platelet particles in alkaline solutions as a function of pH, potential, and mass loading. A geometrical model that describes the electrochemically active surface area contributions for a porous electrode of stacked high-aspect ratio particles is developed, which pinpoints the origin of reactivity for redox conversion processes and oxygen evolution at the edge facets of the particles.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000480502300003

In this work, we propose a new method by using melamine-uric acid (MAUA) supramolecular nanofibers as precursor to fabricate metal-embedded nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube materials (MM '@NCNTs, M, M ' = Fe, Co, Ni). The samples exhibit superior and stable catalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. In all the electrocatalysts, FeNi@NCNT shows the best electrocatalytic activity with the overpotential is only 402 mV (vs. RHE) at 10 mA center dot cm(-2), which shows better performance than both Fe@NCNT and Ni@NCNT. The smaller Tafel slope value, with the value of 68 mV center dot dec(-1), indicates the superior OER activity of FeNi@NCNT.

The incorporation of manganese into the porous structure enhances the nickel catalyst's activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline solution. The best catalyst demonstrates low onset overpotential (0.15 V) for the hydrogen evolution reaction along with high current densities at higher potentials. In addition, the possibility to alter the electrocatalytic properties of the materials from the hydrogen to oxygen evolution reaction by simple surface oxidation is shown. The surface area increases up to 1200 m(2) g(-1) after mild oxidation accompanied by the formation of nickel oxide on the surface. A detailed analysis shows a synergetic effect of the oxide formation and the material's surface area on the catalytic performance in the oxygen evolution reaction. In addition, the synthesis of cobalt doped sponge-like nickel materials is also delineated, demonstrating the generality of the synthesis. The facile salt melt synthesis of such highly porous metal based materials opens new possibilities for the fabrication of diverse electrode nanostructures for electrochemical applications.									151	6	0	0	5	0	151			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000347897000006

They are complex electrochemical reactions that take place through the direct transfer of electrons. However, mostly they have high over-potentials and slow kinetics, that is why they require electrocatalysts to lower the over-potential of the reactions and enhance the reaction rate. The commercially used catalysts (e.g., ruthenium nanoparticles-Ru, iridium nanoparticles-Ir, and their oxides: RuO2, IrO2, platinum-Pt) contain metals that have poor stability, and are not economically worthwhile for widespread application. Here, we propose the spinel structure of nickel-cobalt oxide (NiCo2O4) fabricated to serve as electrocatalyst for OER. These structures were obtained by a facile two-step method: (1) One-pot solvothermal reaction and subsequently (2) pyrolysis or carbonization, respectively. This material exhibits novel rod-like morphology formed by tiny spheres. The presence of transition metal particles such as Co and Ni due to their conductivity and electron configurations provides a great number of active sites, which brings superior electrochemical performance in oxygen evolution and good stability in long-term tests. Therefore, it is believed that we propose interesting low-cost material that can act as a super stable catalyst in OER.									3	1	0	0	0	1	4				1996-1944		WOS:000580181800001	32899780

Oxygen evolution occurs in parallel to a solid transformation. Post-catalytic essays indicate that the CsCo9 salt is transformed into the corresponding [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) salt, upon cesium loss. Remarkably, analogous photoactivated oxygen evolution experiments starting with the [Ru(bpy)(3)]((5)Kr-+x)((6-)2x)[Co-9(H2O)(6)(OH)(3)(HPO4)(2)(PW9O34)(3)]center dot(39+x)H2O(RuCo9) salt demonstrate much higher efficiency and kinetics. The origin of this improved performance is at the cation-anion, photosensitizer-catalyst pairing in the solid state. This is beneficial for the electron transfer event, and for the long-term stability of the photosensitizer. The latter was confirmed as the limiting process during these oxygen evolution reactions, with the polyoxometalate catalyst exhibiting robust performance in multiple cycles, upon addition of photosensitizer, and/or oxidant to the reaction mixture.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2296-2646			WOS:000441515800001	30155455

The high-performance electrocatalysts depend on the catalytically active and highly accessible reaction sites and their structural robustness, while the rational design of such electrocatalysts with desired features avoiding tedious manufacture is still challenging. Here, a facile method is reported to synthesize mesoporous and heterostructured transition metal oxides strongly anchored on a nickel skeleton (MH-TMO) containing identified Fe-Cu oxide interfaces with high intrinsic activity, easy accessibility for reaction intermediates, and long-term stability for alkaline oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions. The MH-TMO with the electrocatalytically active Fe-O-Cu bridge has an optimal oxygen binding energy to facilitate adsorption/desorption of oxygen intermediates for oxygen molecules. Associated with the high mass transport through the nanoporous structure, MH-TMO exhibits impressive oxygen evolution reaction catalysis, with an extremely low overpotential of around 0.22 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and low Tafel slope (44.5 mV dec(-1)) in 1.0 M KOH, realizing a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) with an overpotential as low as 0.26 V. As a result, the alkaline electrolyzer assembled by the bifunctional MH-TMO catalysts operates with an outstanding overall water-splitting output (1.49 V@10 mA cm(-2)), outperforming one assembled with noble-metal-based catalysts.									21	0	0	0	1	0	20			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000779251300001

Here, bimetallic carbon nanocubes electrocatalysts are derived from Hofmann-type metal-organic frameworks by carbonization and oxidization (FeNi@OCNC). FeNi@OCNC achieved a current density of 10 mA c (-2) at a low overpotential of 300.4 mV with a very small Tafel slope of 55.4 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH, and its activity shows 12 h stability. We propose that the coupling effect between Fe, Ni metals is crucial for tuning the electrocatalytic activity, which makes FeNi@OCNC have more oxygen vacancies and higher carbon graphitization degree, thus showing excellent activity. The result may illustrate that bimetallic metal-organic framework-derived carbon nanocubes can be prospective materials for oxygen evolution reaction.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000574668600041

The as-prepared catalyst exhibits excellent performance towards both hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Only 62 mV and 320 mV overpotentials were required to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. That current density is measured at the voltage of 1.59 V for an overall water splitting when used as both anode and cathode. The scanning electron microscopy images indicate a high dispersion of the P-Co sample on the Ni foam. The prepared material possesses a relative high ECSA and a low charge transfer resistance, indicating a large number of active sites for water splitting. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In this work, we creatively use a metal-free oxygen evolution catalyst of water electrolysis to the hydrometallurgy system. An amino-rich hierarchical-network carbon(Amino-HNC) electrocatalyst was prepared by a simple two-step method of amino-assisted polymerization and carbonization process. The surface morphology, phase composition, and electrochemical properties were characterized. The results show that Amino-HNC is an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction with an amino-rich network structure, and the oxygen evolution overpotential in 0.5 mol L-1 H2SO4 electrolyte is 389 mV (@ 10 mA cm(-2)). Meanwhile, the prefabricated catalyst is directly used as an anode in the zinc electrowinning system (50 g L-1 Zn2+ + 150 g L-1 H2SO4) to measure the cell voltage. Compare with the traditional pure lead anode, the cell voltage decreased in a short time during the zinc electrowinning process.

Here we report on potential-regulated hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity at cobalt-based oxide interfaces with an alkaline solution. The switchable wetting of single particles, directly related to their activity and stability towards the oxygen evolution reaction, was revealed by electrochemical liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy. Analysis of the movement of the liquid in real time revealed distinctive wettability behaviour associated with specific potential ranges. At low potentials, an overall reduction of the hydrophobicity of the oxides was probed. Upon reversible reconstruction towards the surface oxyhydroxide phase, electrowetting was found to cause a change in the interfacial capacitance. At high potentials, the evolution of molecular oxygen, confirmed by operando electron energy-loss spectroscopy, was accompanied by a globally thinner liquid layer. This work directly links the physical wetting with the chemical oxygen evolution reaction of single particles, providing fundamental insights into solid-liquid interfacial interactions of oxygen-evolving oxides.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2520-1158			WOS:000736403800001	35141468

The as-result CoOx-N-C/TiO2C composites are further explored as the trifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, and oxygen evolution reaction. Among composites containing different Ti3C2Tx dosages, the CoOx-N-C/TiO2C(22.7%) exhibits the most excellent electrochemical conductivity. When CoOx-N-C/TiO2C(22.7%) is used as the electrocatalyst for water splitting, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (E-j = 10) is achieved at a low cell voltage of 1.45 V. Meanwhile, the overall oxygen activity of the CoOx-N-C/TiO2C(22.7%) shows a small potential difference (0.72V) between the E-j = 10 for oxygen evolution reaction and the half-wave potential for oxygen reduction reaction. The outstanding catalytic performances are mainly attributed to the synergistic effect among the different components of the CoOx-N-C/TiO2C composite, such as carbon nanotube content that is in favour of electronic mobility, hierarchical porosity that facilitates mass transport, and uniformly dispersed cobalt, cobalt oxide, and titanium dioxide active sites in the carbon framework. Consequently, the present work will shed light on the application of other metal-organic framework- and carbon-based electrocatalysts for energy conversion.									35	2	0	0	4	0	35			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000458709900041

Hence, Fe-doped NiCo(2)O(4)nanobelts were designed and prepared as catalysts toward OER. By increasing the Fe amount, the catalytic performances of the as-synthesized products went up and then decreased. Profiting from the synergistic effect between Fe atom and NiCo2O4, all the Fe-NiCo(2)O(4)catalysts exhibited superior catalytic activities to the corresponding NiCo2O4. In addition, the characteristic nanobelt architecture facilitates the conduction of electrons and the exposure of active sites. With the optimal Fe content, the 9.1 % Fe-NiCo(2)O(4)yielded the smallest overpotential and Tafel slope among the catalysts, distinctly lower than that of RuO2.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000572374000001	32452585

In this study, a facile one-pot process is introduced to prepare an advanced bifunctional catalyst (op-LN) incorporating nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) into perovskite La0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 nanoparticles (LSCF-NPs). Confirmed by half-cell testing, op-LN exhibits synergistic effects of LSCF-NP and NCNT with excellent bifunctionality for both the oxygen reduction reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction. Furthermore, op-LN exhibits comparable performances in these reactions to Pt/C and Ir/C, respectively, which highlights its potential for use as a commercially viable bifunctional catalyst. Moreover, the results obtained by testing op-LN in a practical Li-air battery demonstrate improved and complementary charge/discharge performance compared to those of LSCF-NP and NCNT, and this confirms that simply prepared op-LN is a promising candidate as a highly effective bifunctional catalyst for rechargeable metal-air batteries.									83	4	0	0	8	0	82			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000351617500017	25684405

In this study, a heterostructure of zinc iron oxide (ZnFe2O4) and polyoxometalate (POM) nanoplates (POM-ZnFe2O4) was fabricated for the first time by a hydrothermal process. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) analysis of POM-ZnFe2O4 furnished low overpotentials of 268 and 356 mV, and 220 and 290 mV to achieve current densities of 20 and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively. In addition, an electrolytic cell composed of a POM-ZnFe2O4 cathode and anode required an operating voltage of 1.53 V to deliver a current of 10 mA cm(-2). The improved electrochemical performance of POM-ZnFe2O4 compared to commercial and recently reported catalysts is attributed to the high electrocatalytically active surface area, modulation in the electronic and chemical properties and the formation of heterojunction of ZnFe2O4 and POM, which are vital for accelerating HER and OER activity.

With lead-silver anodes, increasing the Mn2+ concentration catalyses the oxygen evolution current by stimulating the reaction rate. Impedance data reveal a transient inhibition of the reaction, ascribed to the adsorption of a silver-salt containing manganese. The addition of Co2+ catalyses oxygen evolution, mainly on the pure lead anode. For lead-silver anodes, the small catalytic effect of Co2+ ions implies an increase in the Tafel coefficient for the oxygen reaction. The transient inhibiting process suggests the formation of a cobalt-containing adsorbate on the pure lead anode.									39	3	0	0	3	0	39			0021-891X			WOS:000081035600005

Both of them suffer from sluggish kinetics, which calls for cost-effective and high-performance electrocatalysts to promote.

Both intrinsic catalyst activity and extrinsic physicochemical characters play a vital role in overall electrocatalytic reactivity. Herein, recent advances in rational design and effective construction of precious-metal-free materials are reviewed for OER and ORR, respectively, in the respects of electronic structure regulation, nanostructure tailor, and freestanding electrode fabrication. The reaction mechanism of OER and ORR are also updated.

They include robust metallic surface states, high carrier mobility, chiral fermions, and ultralong Fermi arcs. An exciting recent finding is that these properties are strongly related to adsorption and electron transfer in various heterogeneous catalysis reactions, such as hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, oxygen reduction, enantiospecific adsorption, and hydrometallation. Thus, we expect that the introduction of non-trivial symmetry-protected topological order will offer important freedom for designing high-performance heterogeneous catalysts. To uncover the contribution of the topologically non-trivial electronic structure to the heterogeneous reactions, in situ techniques are urgently needed to detect the interaction between surface states, topological electrons, and reaction intermediates.

It is the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode of water electrolyzer that limits the overall efficiency. The large spinel oxide family is widely studied due to their low cost and promising OER activity. As the distribution of transition metal (TM) cations in octahedral and tetrahedral site is an important variable controlling the electronic structure of spinel oxides, the TM geometric effect on OER is discussed. The dominant role of octahedral sites is found experimentally and explained by computational studies. The redox-active TM locating at octahedral site guarantees an effective interaction with the oxygen at OER conditions. In addition, the adjacent octahedral centers in spinel act cooperatively in promoting the fast OER kinetics. In remarkable contrast, the isolated tetrahedral TM centers in spinel prohibit the OER mediated by dual-metal sites. Furthermore, various spinel oxides preferentially expose octahedral-occupied cations on the surface, making the octahedral cations easily accessible to the reactants. The future perspectives and challenges in advancing fundamental understanding and developing robust spinel catalysts are discussed.									103	6	0	0	4	0	103			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000479736700001	31361056

However, progress in this area has been limited by the poor understanding of the dynamic active structure of catalysts under realistic OER conditions. Here, an atomic Co-doped nanoporous RuO(2)( )electrocatalyst, which exhibited excellent OER activity and stability in acidic conditions, was synthesized through annealing and etching of a nanoporous Co-Ru alloy. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy results confirmed that the etching strategy produced abundant oxygen vacancies around the metal centers in the atomic Co-doped nanoporous RuO2 electrocatalyst. These vacancies created contracted metal-oxygen ligand bonds under realistic OER conditions. The dynamic structural evolution of the synthesized electrocatalyst allowed them to experience lower kinetic barriers during OER catalysis, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity and stability. This study also provided atomic details on the active structure of the electrocatalyst and the influence of their structural evolution on OER activity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000743891700001

In this work, the screening of electrocatalytic activities of a series of single metallic iron, cobalt, and nickel nanoparticles and their binary and ternary alloys encapsulated in a graphitic carbon shell toward the OER, ORR, and HER in alkaline media is reported. Synthesis of these compounds proceeds by a two-step sol-gel and carbothermal reduction procedure. Various ex situ characterizations show that with harsh electrochemical activation, the graphitic shell undergoes an electrochemical exfoliation. The modified electronic properties of the remaining graphene layers prevent their exfoliation, protect the bulk of the metallic cores, and participate in the electrocatalysis. The amount of near-surface, higher-oxidation-state metals in the as-prepared samples increases with electrochemical cycling, indicating that some metallic nanoparticles are not adequately encased within the graphite shell. Such surface oxide species provide secondary active sites for the electrocatalytic activities. The Ni-Fe binary system gives the most promising results for the OER, and the Co-Fe binary system shows the most promise for the ORR and HER.									104	9	0	0	3	0	105			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000498613600001

New reaction mechanisms are proposed that lead to the decomposition of water molecules on TiO2 clusters. The oxygen evolution reaction at the anode is investigated using electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). Simulations are carried out for different cluster sizes (monomers and dimers). For each reaction path, the free energy profile is computed, at different biases, from the DFT energies as well as the entropic and the zero-point energy contributions. The mechanisms of the oxygen evolution reaction explored in the present work are found to be energetically more feasible than alternative reaction pathways considered in previous theoretical works based on cluster approximations of the surface of the photocatalyst. Finally, the representation of the surface of specific, commonly occurring, titanium dioxide crystals (e.g., rutile and anatase) within the small cluster approximation is able to reproduce qualitatively the rutile (110) outperforming of the anatase (001) surface.									11	1	0	0	1	0	11			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000368562200054

Here, we report a promisingly dendritic core-shell nickel-iron-copper metal/metal oxide electrode, prepared via dealloying with an electrodeposited nickel-iron-copper alloy as a precursor, as the catalyst for water oxidation. The as-prepared core-shell nickel-iron-copper electrode is characterized with porous oxide shells and metallic cores. This tri-metal-based core-shell nickel-iron-copper electrode exhibits a remarkable activity toward water oxidation in alkaline medium with an overpotential of only 180 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The core-shell NiFeCu electrode exhibits pH-dependent oxygen evolution reaction activity on the reversible hydrogen electrode scale, suggesting that non-concerted proton-electron transfers participate in catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction. To the best of our knowledge, the as-fabricated core-shell nickel-iron-copper is one of the most promising oxygen evolution catalysts.									258	10	0	0	9	0	259			2041-1723			WOS:000423430900001	29374160

However, Li-O-2 batteries are suffering from poor cycle life, low rate capability and poor round-trip efficiency. In-depth understanding on the reaction and degradation mechanism is the prerequisite for rational electrode and electrolyte design for efficient and long-life Li-O-2 batteries. In this review, we analyze recent progress in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism. We discuss on-going debates and open questions related to OER processes including the reaction intermediates, the origin for the side reactions, the reaction interface and the catalysis mechanism. We provide insights into the sources of discrepancies and highlight future research directions in deepening the understanding of Li-O-2 reactions and strategies in mitigating the severe instability between the reaction intermediates and cell components for efficient and long-life Li-O-2 batteries.									57	4	0	0	2	0	57			2405-8297			WOS:000529908800022

In this work, we systematically investigate the mechanisms of the ORR/OER reactions in nonaqueous Li-O-2 batteries by using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, using 5,5-dimethyl-pyrroline N-oxide as a spin trap. The study provides direct verification of the formation of the superoxide radical anion (O-2(center dot-)) as an intermediate in the ORR during the discharge process, while no O2(center dot-) was detected in the OER during the charge process. These findings provide insight into, and an understanding of, the fundamental reaction mechanisms involving oxygen and guide the further development of this field.									52	2	0	0	2	0	54			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000342813300008	25045007

Herein, we developed a novel oxygen-enriched nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) nanosheets electrocatalyst prepared by water-plasma assisted synthesis. The water-plasma engraved oxygen-enriched NiFe-LDH nanosheets possessed a large petal structure of similar to 3 mu m lateral size with plentiful pores distributed on each flak with 10 nm thicknesses, and a large BET surface area (151 m(2) g(-1)). Profiting by enriched oxygen atoms and fast charge transfer, the oxygen-enriched NiFe-LDH nanosheets displayed a favorable electrocatalytic performance toward OER with a low Tafel slope of 74 mV dec(-1) and an overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) for 310 mV in 1.0 M KOH. Such low overpotential was much smaller than initial NiFe-LDH nanosheets (360 mV), and even superior to commercial Ir/C electrocatalyst (370 mV). Sustainable and highly active full water splitting enabled by oxygen-enriched NiFe-LDH nanosheets could be further driven by solar cell or two alkali batteries.									46	6	0	0	3	0	46			2168-0485			WOS:000459367400067

As an important family of functional materials, transition metal oxides are generally believed inactive towards hydrogen evolution reaction, although many of them show high activity for oxygen evolution reaction. Here we report the remarkable electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction of a layered metal oxide, Ruddlesden-Popper-type Sr2RuO4 with alternative perovskite layer and rock-salt SrO layer, in an alkaline solution, which is comparable to those of the best electrocatalysts ever reported. By theoretical calculations, such excellent activity is attributed mainly to an unusual synergistic effect in the layered structure, whereby the (001) SrO-terminated surface cleaved in rock-salt layer facilitates a barrier-free water dissociation while the active apical oxygen site in perovskite layer promotes favorable hydrogen adsorption and evolution. Moreover, the activity of such layered oxide can be further improved by electrochemistry-induced activation.									168	5	0	0	15	0	169			2041-1723			WOS:000455473700017	30635568

Crystal phase is the crucial factor that governs the electrochemical property and electrocatalytic reaction pathways. Here, a one-step nickel foam derived sulfidation method was presented to synthesize self-supported NiS2 and Ni3S2. The crystal phase-dependent chemical properties related to electrocatalytic behavior were evaluated by a series of advanced characterization and density functional theory calculations. Overall, the self-supported Ni3S2 shows high electrochemical activity towards both HER and OER in alkaline conditions, which afford the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with overpotentials of 245 mV for OER and 123 mV for HER, respectively. When employed the self-supported Ni3S2 as the bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting, the entire device provides the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.61 V. These results indicate that the electrocatalytic properties can be exert greater improved by controlling the crystal phase, offering the prospect for advanced materials design and development.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000595313400001	33263319

Herein, two isostructural Ni-II redox-active metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) containing flexible tripodal trispyridyl ligand (L) and linear dicarboxylates such as terephthalate (TA) and 2-aminoterphthalate (H(2)NTA) are studied for their catalytic activity in oxygen evaluation reaction (OER). The 2D-layered MOFs form 3D hydrogen bonded frameworks containing one-dimensional hydrophilic channels that are filled with water molecules. The electrochemical studies reveal that MOFs display an efficient catalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline conditions with an overpotential as low as 356 mV. Further, these 2D-MOFs exhibit excellent ability to adsorb water vapor (180-230 cc g(-1) at 273 K) and CO2 (33 cc g(-1) at 273 K). The presence of hydrophilic functionality in the frameworks was found to significantly enhance the electrocatalytic activity as well as H2O sorption.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000479859800001	31250943

Here, our work provides valuable insights into interfacial structure and ionic interactions during alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The importance of inner-sphere OH- adsorption is demonstrated as the IrOx activity in 4.0 M KOH is 6.5 times higher than that in 0.1 M KOH. Adding NaNO3 as a supporting electrolyte, which is found to be inert for long-term stability, complicates the electrocatalytic reaction in a half cell. The nonspecially adsorbed Na+ in the outer compact interfacial layer is suggested to form a stronger noncovalent interaction with OH- through hydrogen bond than adsorbed K+, leading to the decrease of interfacial OH- mobility. This hypothesis highlights the importance of outer-sphere adsorption for the OER, which is generally recognized as a pure inner-sphere process. Meanwhile, based on our experimental observations, the pseudocapacitive behavior of solid-state redox might be more reliable in quantifying active sites for OER than that measured from the conventional EDL charging capacitive process. The interfacial oxygen transport is observed to improve with increasing electrolyte conductivity, ascribing to the increased accessible active sites. The durability results in a liquid alkaline electrolyzer which shows that adding NaNO3 into KOH solution leads to additional degradation of OER activity and long-term stability. These findings provide an improved understanding of the mechanistic details and structural motifs required for efficient and robust electrocatalysis.									33	0	0	0	2	0	33			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000487179900023	31436074

However, in sea water electrolysis poisonous chlorine evolution is the most favored reaction over oxygen evolution at the anode. In this work, study has been focused on the development of electrode materials with high selectivity for oxygen evolution reaction over chlorine evolution. We employed perm selective membrane i.e. sulfonated polystyrene-block-(ethylene-ran-butylene)-block-polystyrene (SPSEBS) which electrostaticlly repels the chloride ion (Cl-) to the electrode surface and thereby enhances the oxygen evolution and reduces the chlorine evolution at the anode. The electrochemical behavior of both modified and bare IrO2 electrodes were characterized using polarization studies and the gas evolution efficiencies are calculated based on bulk electrolysis method. The surface morphology of the electrode was analyzed before and after electrolysis using scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results suggest that the nearly 95% oxygen evolution efficiency could be achieved when the surface of IrO2/Ti electrode was modified with perm selective membrane.

Herein, a bifunctional oxygen electrode film prepared by adhering NiCo2O4 nanosheets to a nitrogen and oxygen dual-doped carbon nanotubes film in a large scale is reported. The resulting self-supporting film electrode is multifunctional, which integrates a porous conducting structure for air diffusion and charge transfer, high-performance catalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution, and novel structural flexibility. The composite film demonstrates excellent oxygen reduction/evolution reaction catalytic activities with low Tafel slopes (50 mV dec(-1) for oxygen reduction reaction; 92 mV dec(-1) for oxygen evolution reaction). Without any additional current collector, gas diffusion layer, or binder, the obtained bifunctional film performs as an "all-in-one" air electrode in a Zn-air battery. A 50-cm-long cable-shaped Zn-air battery based on such a film air electrode exhibits high operating potentials (approximate to 1.2 V at 0.25 mA cm(-2)), low charging-discharging overpotentials (approximate to 0.7 V), and stable cycling performance. Moreover, the flexible cable Zn-air batteries show excellent stability under different deformation conditions. The proposed concept of constructing scalable, all-in-one, freestanding, and flexible air electrodes would pave the way to develop next-generation wearable and portable energy-storage devices.									50	5	0	0	1	0	50			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000451566800001	30334376

However, rational structural regulation of metal oxides-based electrode under mild conditions to simultaneously achieve abundant active sites and synergistic effects of multiple active centers is still very challenging. In this study, the Bi2MoO6 nanosheets with adequate oxygen vacancies and heteroatom nitrogen injection were synthesized via hydrothermal reaction and subsequent NH3/Ar plasma modification. Controllable generation of O vacancies and injection of N atoms in Bi2MoO6 was conducive to regulating the band structure of electrode material, achieving greatly enhanced conductivity, wettability, ionic infiltration capacity and significantly reduced dissociation barrier of surface adsorbates. Compared with pristine Bi2MoO6, the plasma engraved Bi2MoO6 electrode delivered superior charge storage performance for supercapacitor (79.0% of capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles at 20 Ag-1) and good electrochemical catalytic efficiency for oxygen evolution reaction (349 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1)). It is demonstrated that the plasma modification for metal oxides is a promising application in supercapacitors and electrochemical water splitting.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000624474700006

Cost-efficient ABO(3) perovskites have been studied extensively because of their high activity for the oxygen evolution reaction; however, they lack stability, and an effective solution to this problem has not yet been demonstrated. Here we report that the Fe4+-based quadruple perovskite CaCu3Fe4O12 has high activity, which is comparable to or exceeding those of state-of-the-art catalysts such as Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 - delta and the gold standard RuO2. The covalent bonding network incorporating multiple Cu2+ and Fe4+ transition metal ions significantly enhances the structural stability of CaCu3Fe4O12, which is key to achieving highly active long-life catalysts.									309	7	0	0	31	0	307			2041-1723			WOS:000363017500020	26354832

However, challenging issues including the sluggish kinetics of oxygen electrode reactions involving the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are present, limiting the implementation of devices such as metal-air batteries, water electrolyzers, and regenerative fuel cells. In this review, various monometallic and bimetallic transition metal oxides (TMOs) and hydroxides are summarized in terms of their application for ORR/OER, in which the merits and demerits of various precious metal and carbon-based metal oxide materials are discussed, with requirements for better electrocatalysts and catalyst support being introduced as well. Following this, different approaches to improve catalytic activity such as the introduction of doping and defects, the manipulation of crystal facets, and the engineering of supports, compositions, and morphologies are summarized in which TMOs with improved ORR/OER catalytic activities can be synthesized, further improving the speed, stability, and polarization of electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices. Finally, perspectives into the improvement of performance and the better understanding of ORR/OER mechanisms for bifunctional electrocatalysts using in situ spectroscopic techniques and density functional theory calculations are also discussed.									42	3	0	0	1	0	42			0009-4536	2192-6549		WOS:000474174700001

XRD spectrum indicates the existence of cubic NiCoO2 phase without any impurities. SEM results indicate the presence of porous structures in all the three cases, a typical characteristic of combustion synthesized samples, which is due to the evolution of gases during the synthesis process. TEM along with the phase mapping shows the presence of well dispersed elements Ni, Co and O throughout the sample. All the three catalysts were evaluated for their bifunctionality towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. NiCoO2 shows the highest number of electron transfer in the overall reaction mechanism with the maximum kinetic current density of 12.3 mA/cm(2). The kinetics of NiCoO2 towards ORR and OER was analyzed using Tafel plot and compared with the mono-metal oxides. The catalytic stability was evaluated for 24 h using continuous chronoamperometric (CA) runs, where NiCoO2 shows exceptionally stable performance without any significant decay in current. The highest activity of NiCoO2 could be due to the presence of higher oxidation states of Ni and Co and because of the existence of the oxygen defects acting as active sites for the oxygen adsorption/desorption during the electrocatalytic reactions. Based on the activity and stability trends, NiCoO2 is found to be a promising bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for long-term applications. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.
