Their catalytic activity and stability in 1 M KOH alkaline medium were investigated. The phase formation and structure of the prepared oxides were determined by Powder X-ray diffraction. The morphology of prepared catalysts was confirmed by SEM analysis. The catalytic performance of the prepared catalyst in alkaline solution was investigated using electrochemical measurements for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). This series of double perovskite oxide materials exhibit catalytic activity for both OER and ORR. Pr0.90Ba1.10Co2O6-delta shows wonderful OER activity among all the catalysts with a specific capacitance of 598.40 F/g and double-layer capacitance of 38.94 mF/cm(2). Power low gives a hint of oxide-ion intercalation pseudocapacitance in the Pr0.90Ba1.10Co2O6-delta. On the other hand, Pr0.90Ba1.10Co2O6-delta exhibits potential behavior for ORR. Overall, our findings highlight the combined effects of incorporating Ba into double perovskite PrBaCo2O6-delta in its behavior for OER and ORR.(C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

J	Chakrapani, Vidhya								Probing Active Sites and Reaction Intermediates of Electrocatalysis Through Confocal Near-Infrared Photoluminescence Spectroscopy: A Perspective								FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY				8						327	10.3389/fchem.2020.00327				APR 28 2020	2020	Electrocatalytic reactions such as oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) are one of the most complex heterogeneous charge transfer processes because of the involvement of multiple proton-coupled-electron transfer steps over a narrow potential range and the formation/breaking of oxygen-oxygen bonds. Obtaining a clear mechanistic picture of these reactions on some highly active strongly-correlated oxides such as MnOx, NiOx, and IrO(x)has been challenging due to the inherent limitations of the common spectroscopic tools used for probing the reactive intermediates and active sites. This perspective article briefly summarizes some of the key challenges encountered in such probes and describes some of unique advantages of confocal near-infrared photoluminescence (NIR-PL) technique for probing surface and bulk metal cation states underin-situandex-situelectrochemical polarization studies. Use of this technique opens up a new avenue for studying changes in the electronic structure of metal oxides occurring as a result of perturbation of defect equilibria, which is crucial in a broad range of heterogeneous systems such as catalysis, photocatalysis, mineral redox chemistry, and batteries.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2296-2646			WOS:000556600300001	32411668

Accordingly, the Ni-Co LDH nanosheets were synthesized serving as catalysts for the OER. Electrochemical measurements exhibited that the as-designed Ni-Co LDH nanosheets possessed low charge transfer resistance and high catalytic activity, superior to that of the noble RuO2. In addition, the outstanding durability was obtained by the as-prepared Ni-Co LDH, indicating the promising application in OER.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2352-4928			WOS:000487837200048

Comparing the two half-reactions, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the more difficult to be optimized and still relies on expensive noble metal-based catalysts such as Ru or Ir. In this paper, we prepared nanoparticles of HfN and Hf2ON2 and tested them for the OER for the first time. The HfN sample, in particular, showed the highest activity, requiring an overpotential of only 358 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in Fe-free electrolyte and, above all, exhibiting long-term stability. This result places this system amongst one of the most promising catalysts for OER tested to date, in terms of sustainability, activity and stability. The prepared nanoparticles are small (less than 15 nm in diameter), well-defined in shape and crystalline, and were characterised before and after electrochemical testing also via electron microscopy (EM), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000487402600001	31437350

However, it is still a challenge to design and prepare multi metals heterostructure catalyst with high performance. In this paper, a simple and efficient preparation method was used to anchor Ni-x vertical bar Mn1-xO heterostructure nanoparticles on CNTs with oxygen defect sites. The treated CNT were used to provide stable anchor sites for metal ions, and effectively induced the production of highly fused Ni-x vertical bar Mn1-xO nanoparticles with atomic-level heterogeneous interfaces. The Ni-0.95 vertical bar Mn0.05O/CNT catalyst shows a nice oxygen evolution reaction performance. At a current density of 10 mA cm -2 , the overpotential is only 293 mV, and the Tafel slope is 55.6 mV dec(-1), which is much better than that of Ni/CNT and MnO/CNT catalyst under the same conditions. According to the experimental result and density functional theory calculation, it is suggested that the proportion of heterogeneous metal elements, the phase composition at the heterogeneous interface, the heterostructure size and the heterostructure carrier will affect the oxygen evolution catalyst performance. This work is benefit for the design of cheap and high-performance catalyst with multi metal heterogeneous interfaces.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000724863800001

Herein, we demonstrated a facile and clean electrochemical technique to directly synthesize CoS nanosheets with high purity onto the surface of carbon cloth, and a quick thermal treatment was performed to further improve the catalytic performance (CoS-A). This novel electrochemical technique avoids the use of the binder, surfactant, and other organic additives, which may cause poor electric conductivity as well as undesirable surface wettability, exhibiting great potential of the large-scale applications. The obtained CoS-A exhibits a superior electrocatalytic performance for the OER and ORR, with a high ORR current density (-1.51 mA cm(-2) at 0.2 V), considerable OER current density (148 mA cm(-2) at 1.9 V), and excellent durability in continuous measurement for over 12 h. The approach offers a powerful yet simple method to control the phase, composition, and morphology of a highly active CoS catalyst, which provides a new idea for the design of high-performance catalysts.									44	3	0	0	2	0	44			1944-8244			WOS:000444793000047	30052415

In this work, N-doped carbon nanocages (N-CCs) with a porous self-supported architecture and high specific surface area are synthesized by a facile interfacial assembly synthetic route. The materials are comprehensively characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption experiments, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and linear sweep voltammetry demonstrate that the as-prepared N-CC could serve as an effective metal-free electrocatalyst with excellent catalytic activity, long-term operation durability, and excellent methanol tolerance for the ORR in alkaline media. In the presence of 3 mM methanol, the half wave potential of the N-CCs for the ORR is 190 mV; this is more positive than that of the commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst. Meanwhile, the N-CCs also show an OER activity comparable to that of the commercial Ru/C electrocatalyst, revealing their bifunctional property.									67	7	0	0	3	0	67			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000427907700014

The OER activity can be promoted by generating high valence transition-metal species in the electrocatalysts. In the present work, a versatile anion-cation double doped Co3O4 (Se/Ni-Co3O4) microtube architecture is innovatively fabricated as an OER electrocatalyst, by combining reliable and template-free solvothermal strategy and calcination treatment. The obtained Se/Ni-Co3O4 possesses some desirable properties for OER including an attractive mesoporous structure, abundant exposed active species associated with surface oxygen vacancies, and fast charge transfer rate. By precisely exploring the redox reaction behavior, it is found that the effective Se and Ni double doping could readily promote the generation of active Co(IV) species. Consequently, the obtained Se/Ni-Co3O4 electrocatalyst affords a very good OER electrocatalytic activity with an onset potential of 1.47 V, small Tafel slope (62.9 mV dec(-1)), and excellent durability in alkaline solution, which is even superior to that obtained in the benchmark RuO2. The novel strategy introduced in this research may open a new opportunity for the rational design of highly efficient Co3O4-based OER electrocatalysts.									29	0	0	0	2	0	29			2168-0485			WOS:000474474800093

Thermodynamics dictate that these elements oxidize during industrial operation. The formed oxyanions are water soluble and thus predominantly leach in a reconstruction process. Nevertheless, recently, it was unveiled that these thermodynamically stable (oxy)anions can adsorb on the surface or intercalate in the interlayer space of the active catalyst. There, they tune the electronic properties of the active sites and can interact with the reaction intermediates, changing the OER kinetics and potentially breaking the persisting OER *OH/*OOH scaling relations. Thus, the addition of (oxy)anions to the electrolyte opens a new design dimension for OER catalysis and the herein discussed observations deepen the understanding of the role of anions in the OER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000835797100001	35762646

Herein, we rationally designed a carbon-based Mn-N2C2 bifunctional electrocatalyst. It exhibits a half-wave potential of 0.915 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and the overpotential is 350 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline condition. Furthermore, by means of operando X-ray absorption fine structure measurements, we reveal that the bond-length-extended Mn2+-N2C2 atomic interface sites act as active centers during the ORR process, while the bond-length-shortened high-valence Mn4+-N2C2 moieties serve as the catalytic sites for OER, which is consistent with the density functional theory results. The atomic and electronic synergistic effects for the isolated Mn sites and the carbon support play a critical role to promote the oxygen-involved catalytic performance, by regulating the reaction free energy of intermediate adsorption.

However, it is still a great challenge to rationally regulate the coordination environments of SACs and improve the loading of metal atoms for SACs during catalysis progress. Generally, carbon-based materials with excellent electrical conductivity and large specific surface area are widely used as catalyst supports to stabilize metal atoms. Meanwhile, carbon-based material-supported SACs have also been extensively studied and applied in various energy conversion reactions, such as hydrogen evolution reac-tion (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Herein, rational synthesis methods and advanced characterization tech-niques were introduced and summarized in this review. Then, the theoretical design strategies and construction methods for carbon-based material-sup -ported SACs in electrocatalysis applications were fully discussed, which are of great significance for guiding the coordination regulation and improving the loading of SACs. In the end, the challenges and future perspectives of SACs were proposed, which could largely contribute to the development of single atom catalysts at the turning point.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2589-0042		WOS:000809493000008	35620439

However, water splitting exhibits sluggish kinetics because of the high overpotentials of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and should therefore be promoted by OER and/or HER electrocatalysts. As the kinetic barrier of the former reaction exceeds that of the latter, high-performance OER catalysts are highly sought after. Herein, K-doped NiCo2O4 (HK-NCO) was hydrothermally prepared from a Prussian blue analog with a metal-organic framework structure and assessed as an OER catalyst. Extensive K doping increased the number of active oxygen vacancies and changed their intrinsic properties (e.g., binding energy), thus increasing conductivity. As a result, HK-NCO exhibited a Tafel slope of 49.9 mV dec(-1) and a low overpotential of 292 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming a commercial OER catalyst (Ir) and thus holding great promise as a component of high-performance electrode materials for metal-oxide batteries and supercapacitors.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000786692900001	35480370

We further transferred the Co-based complex into Co embedded in nitrogen doped porous carbon (Co@NC) by thermal annealing to investigate the morphology effect of electrocatalysts. It was found the catalytic performance of the catalysts exhibits a trend of quasi-sphere (Co@NC-80) > spindle-like (Co@NC-300) > branched spindle (Co@NC-200) > disk-like (Co@NC-130), probably due to the various exposed efficient active sites of the catalyst induced by their morphology, and various mass transport resistance in the catalysts. Impressively, the Co@NC-80 exhibits comparable ORR (oxygen reduction reaction) activity with Pt/C and better OER (oxygen evolution reaction) activity than RuO2, highlighting its bifunctional catalytic performance for metal-air batteries. The Zn-air catalyzed by Co@NC-80 exhibits an open circuit voltage of 1.35 V, a high specific capacity of 887.5 mA h/g and a max power density of 168.7 mW cm(-2), as well as excellent long-time stability with no obvious performance decay after charge-discharge cycling of 140 h.

Fabrication of such array without a template is, however, extremely challenging. Herein, an ion-exchange approach is employed to fabricate a 1D cobalt sulfide nanorod array (1D-CoS) from Co(3)O(4)on stainless steel. The 1D-CoS electrode works as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, attaining the current density of 10 mA cm(-2)for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction at a low overpotential of 159 and 280 mV, respectively in a 1 M KOH solution. A full electrolyzer with the same two 1D-CoS electrodes assembly demonstrates a low cell voltage of 1.75 V at 10 mA cm(-2)and this performance value is well maintained for 20 hours. The efficient catalytic performance can be due to the controlled CoS phase with a unique 1D nanoarchitecture, which allows facile electrolyte diffusion and charge transfer between electrode/electrolyte interface.									10	0	0	0	3	0	10			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000568028200001

The setup is applied to a subject of high academic and practical interest, namely, the oxygen evolution reaction at Ni and Ni/Fe electrodes. It comprises a transparent substrate electrode, onto which Ni and Ni/Fe thin films are deposited. An ultra-microelectrode (UME) is placed closely above the substrate to obtain electrochemical information, while a Raman microscope probes the same sample spot from below. To obtain information on oxygen evolution activity and structural changes, increasingly positive potentials from 0.1 up to,0:7 V vs Hg vertical bar HgO vertical bar 1 M KOH were applied to the ,Ni/Fe-electrodes in 0.1 M KOH solution. Evolved oxygen is detected by reduction at a Pt UME, allowing for the determination of onset potentials, while the substrate current, which is recorded in parallel, is due to both overlapping oxygen evolution and the oxidation of Ni(OH)(2) to NiOOH. An optimum of 15% Fe in Ni/Fe films. with respect to oxygen evolution activity was determined. At the same time, the potential dependent formation of gamma-NiOOH characterized by the Raman double band at 475 and 557 cm(-1) allows for the conclusion that a certain amount of disorder introduced by Fe atoms is necessary to obtain high oxygen evolution reaction (OER.) activity.									40	2	0	0	1	0	40			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000413392500008	28933151

Applying a reversible multifunctional electrocatalyst to the hydrogen electrode is a practical solution. Ir exhibits excellent catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), and hydrogen oxidation reactions (HOR), yet irreversibly converts to amorphous IrOx at potentials > 0.8V/RHE, which is an excellent catalyst for oxygen evolution reactions (OER), yet a poor HER and HOR catalyst. Harnessing the multifunctional catalytic characteristics of Ir, here we design a unique Ir-based electrocatalyst with high crystallinity for OER, HER, and HOR. Under OER operation, the crystalline nanoparticle generates an atomically-thin IrOx layer, which reversibly transforms into a metallic Ir at more cathodic potentials, restoring high activity for HER and HOR. Our analysis reveals that a metallic Ir subsurface under thin IrOx layer can act as a catalytic substrate for the reduction of Ir ions, creating reversibility. Our work not only uncovers fundamental, uniquely reversible catalytic properties of nanoparticle catalysts, but also offers insights into nanocatalyst design. Reversible multifunctionality in electrocatalysts can allow voltage reversal during device operation. Here, authors design a crystalline Ir-based electrocatalyst with a thin reversible metallic-Ir/IrOx layer that shows activity for O-2 evolution, H-2 evolution, and H-2 oxidation.									28	0	0	0	1	0	28			2041-1723			WOS:000675656600005	34257287

Rational design of highly efficient non-noble materials as bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts is of great importance for large-scale practical applications. A new strongly coupled hybrid material is presented, which comprises CoOx nanoparticles rich in oxygen vacancies grown on B,N-decorated graphene (CoOx NPs/BNG) and operates as an efficient bifunctional OER/ORR electrocatalyst. Advanced spectroscopic techniques were used to confirm formation of abundant oxygen vacancies and strong Co-N-C bridging bonds within the CoOx NPs/BNG hybrid. Surprisingly, the CoOx NPs/BNG hybrid electrocatalyst is highly efficient for the OER with a low overpotential and Tafel slope, and is active in the ORR with a positive half-wave potential and high limiting current density in alkaline medium.									300	16	0	0	12	0	303			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000402857800019	28523861

Despite substantial progress having been made, the precise control and adjustment of the spinel oxides are still challenging owing to the complexity of their crystal structure. In this work, we demonstrate a simple solvent method to tailor the structures of spinel oxides and use the spinel oxide composites (ACo(2)O(4)/NCNTs, A=Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) for oxygen electrocatalysis. The optimized MnCo2O4/NCNTs exhibit high activity and excellent durability for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions. Remarkably, the rechargeable liquid Zn-air battery equipped with a MnCo2O4/NCNTs cathode affords a specific capacity of 827 mAh g(Zn)(-1) with a high power density of 74.63 mW cm(-2) and no voltage degradation after 300 cycles at a high charging-discharging rate (5 mA cm(-2)). The density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the substitution could regulate the ratio of Co3+/Co2+ and thereby lead to the modulation of the electronic structure accompanied with the movement of the d-band center. The tetrahedral and octahedral sites interact through the Mn-O-Co, and the Co-Oh(3+) of MnCo2O4 with the optimal charge structure allows a more suitable binding interaction between the active center and the oxygenated species, resulting in superior oxygen electrocatalytic performance.									33	0	0	0	0	0	33			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000750633700001	34970837	
J	Pavelko, G. F.								Mechanochemical reactions of elementary sulfur and iron sulfides with hydrogen, oxygen, and water								RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY				53	7			981	987		10.1134/S0036023608070012				JUL 2008	2008	Mechanochemical reactions of elementary sulfur and iron sulfides with hydrogen, oxygen, and water were studied. Three reactions were discovered: (1) between elementary sulfur and dihydrogen, (2) between pyrite and dihydrogen, and (3) between elementary sulfur and water; these reactions are accompanied by hydrogen sulfide evolution. Mechanochemical synthesis of iron sulfide from the constituent elements in water involves hydrogen sulfide, which is generated by the reaction of elementary sulfur with water. We show that elementary sulfur is generated during pyrite oxidation by dioxygen during or after dispersion. In an oxygen-free medium, pyrite is more reactive to water than iron sulfide. Pyrite reacts with dihydrogen and water in an oxygen-free medium directly, avoiding the dissociation stage.									4	1	0	0	1	0	5			0036-0236			WOS:000257777300001

Herein, a general gelatin-assisted wet chemistry method is employed to fabricate well-defined iron oxy-hydroxides and transitional metal doped iron oxyhydroxides nanomaterials, which show good catalytic performances for OER. Specifically, the Co-doped iron oxy-hydroxides (Co0.54Fe0.46OOH) show the excellent electrocatalytic performance for OER with an onset potential of 1.52 V, tafel slope of 47 mV/dec and outstanding stability. The ultrahigh oxygen evolution activity and strong durability, with superior performance in comparison to the pure iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) catalysts, originate from the branch structure of Co0.54Fe0.46OOH on its surface so as to provide many active edge sites, enhanced mass/ charge transport capability, easy release oxygen gas bubbles, and strong structural stability, which are advantageous for OER. Meanwhile, Co-doping in FeOOH nanostructures constitutes a desirable four-electron pathway for reversible oxygen evolution and reduction, which is potentially useful for rechargeable metal-air batteries, regenerative fuel cells, and other important clean energy devices. This work may provide a new insight into constructing the promising water oxidation catalysts for practical clean energy application.									39	1	0	0	0	0	39			2045-2322			WOS:000395751700001	28272443

Carbon-supported SACs have been widely applied in electrocatalysis, and their progress has been intensively reviewed. Non-carbon-supported SACs have drawn ever-increasing attention recently, and are emerging as an indispensable class of SACs. This review comprehensively summarizes the recent exciting progress on the non-carbon-supported SACs and their applications in electrocatalytic reactions.

In addition, the overpotential of our catalyst is much lower than that of RuO2, i.e., 20 mV lower at 50 mA cm(-2).

Here, we demonstrate an efficient core/shell photoanode with a highly active oxygen evolution electrocatalyst shell (FeMnP) and semiconductor core (rutile TiO2) for photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution reaction. Metal-organic chemical vapor deposition from a single source precursor was used to ensure good contact between the FeMnP and the TiO2. The TiO2/FeMnP core/shell photoanode reaches the theoretical photocurrent density for rutile TiO2 of 1.8 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode under simulated 100 mW cm(-2) (1 sun) irradiation. The dramatic enhancement is a result of the synergistic effects of the high oxygen evolution reaction activity of FeMnP (delivering an overpotential of 300 mV with a Tafel slope of 65 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH) and the conductive interlayer between the surface active sites and semiconductor core which boosts the interfacial charge transfer and photocarrier collection. The facile fabrication of the TiO2/FeMnP core/shell nanorod array photoanode offers a compelling strategy for preparing highly efficient photoelectrochemical solar energy conversion devices.									90	4	0	0	9	0	90			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000400233200065	28333437

Although some low-cost metal oxides are active on catalyzing OER and HER, the instinct drawback of sluggish charges carriers transfer mobility decrease the reactions kinetic and hinder their application. To overcome the issue, Co-V oxide is successfully built-up with a Co-O-V structure to eliminate energy barrier during carriers transfer by the spin-flip hopping process, which can be coated on various substrate to stimulate OER and HER. Moreover, the V "bridge" between Co-O bonds stimulates the OER through more effective lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism, which can directly format O-O bond in more effective pathway. The protocol could be spread on rational design of such OER electrocatalysts on various electrode to lower-cost water splitting.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000596120200001

Theoretically, bulk Fe-O bond is unfavorable, but surface Fe-O bond is favorable and plays a negative role for HER. The presence of oxygen bonds (native or formed during reaction) is the root source of the reduced HER activity. Surface treatment in 37% HCl solution removes the oxide layer and significantly improves the HER performance, especially in alkaline solution. After etching, the overpotentials in 0.5 M H2SO4 are 79 and 95 mV at 10 and 20 mA cm(-2), respectively. The ones in 1 M KOH are 95 and 102 mV at 10 and 20 mA cm(-2), respectively.

In this work, Ni3S2 and amorphous MoSx nanorods directly grown on Ni foam (Ni3S2-MoSx/NF) were prepared via one-step solvothermal process, which were used as a high-efficient electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. The Ni3S2-MoSx/NF composite exhibits very low overpotentials of 65 and 312 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) and 50 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH for HER and OER, respectively. Besides, it exhibits a low Tafel slope (81 mV dec(-1) for HER, 103 mV dec(-1) for OER), high exchange current density (1.51 mA cm(-2) for HER, 0.26 mA cm(-2) for OER), and remarkable long-term cycle stability.

However, its sluggish kinetics hinders the performance of those technologies, impeding them from broader implementation. Recently, we reported the use of zirconium phosphate (ZrP) as a support for transition metal catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). These catalysts achieve promising overpotentials with high mass activities. Herein, we synthesize ZrP structures with controlled morphology: hexagonal platelets, rods, cubes, and spheres, and subsequently modify them with Co(ii) and Ni(ii) cations to assess their electrochemcial OER behavior. Through inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry measurements, the maximum ion exchange capacity is found to vary based on the morphology of the ZrP structure and cation selection. Trends in geometric current density and mass activity as a function of cation selection are discussed. We find that the loading and coverage of cobalt and nickel species on the ZrP supports are key factors that control OER performance.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000526659200028	31894216

Herein, the authors propose a double steric hindrance strategy by using zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-8 as the first barrier skeleton and encapsulated phenylboronic acid as the second space obstruction to realize densely exposed atomic iron sites. Prepared PA@Z8-Fe-N-C has the highest iron content (5.49 wt%) among reported transition-metal-based single-atom oxygen catalysts. Meanwhile, its concave surfaces, hollow structures, and hierarchical pores enable the high utilization rate of iron sites to 88.5 +/- 4.5% and exposed active site density to 5.2 +/- 0.3 x 10(20) sites g(-1). Resultantly, PA@Z8-Fe-N-C exhibits superior activity and stability to commercial Pt/C and IrO2 for the ORR and OER in half-cells and zinc-air flow batteries. This provides insight for developing densely and accessibly active sites in single-atom catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000729398600001	34898014

However, efficiently producing M-N-x-C organic-based nanosheets for solving the poor activity of bulk-phase catalysts remains a significant challenge. Herein, we put forward a first concept of semi-homogeneous molecular catalysts, through producing 2D metal-polyphthalocyanine (M-PPc) nanosheet with the superiority of hetem/homogeneous via an electrochemical delamination to achieve bridging from hetem to homogeneous. Multi-step ex-situ characterizations and theoretical simulations reveal a novel mechanism of electrochemical stripping, named as electron-coupled transalkylation, where occurs transalkylation, site-to-site transalkylation, and hydrocarbon evolution reactions accompanied by the transformation of intermediates from B-Ni1.0Fe0.3PPc, (TBA(+))(x)center dot B-Ni1.0Fe0.3PPc, x*(C4H9)(x)center dot B-Ni1.0Fe0.3 PPc, to final product of Ni1.0Fe0.3 PPc NSs, realizing the eventual delamination. The semi-homogeneous Ni1.0Fe0.3 PPc NSs delivers a lower overpotential of 269 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) than benchmark RuO2 and maintains superior stability for oxygen evolution. DFT calculations unveil that the NiN4 double sites of Ni1.0Fe0.3 PPc NSs acted as real catalytic centres not only reduce the energy barrier of reaction process, but also accelerate adsorption of intermediates and desorption of oxygen molecules, thus boosting the oxygen evolution kinetics.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000799796900003

The nitrogen atom on the pyrimidine showed excellent coordination ability to metal ions. Their stable metal composite material (Co@COF-Pyr) exhibited remarkable performance for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 m KOH aqueous solution. The overpotential was 450 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The Co@COF-Pyr with large specific surface area (392 m(2) g(-1)) and regular crystal structure provided free passage for H2O to move and make them fully contact with the uniformly dispersed cobalt ions on the surface. Thus, the turnover frequency of Co@COF-Pyr was 0.1 s(-1) at the overpotential of 370 mV, which was higher than most reported OER catalysts. This work provided a new way to design and prepare nitrogen-containing heterocyclic functionalized COFs. They can be combined with metal ions to expand the application of COFs in the field of electrocatalysis.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000695966700001	34378359

However, the bifunctional mechanism has hitherto only been supported by theoretical computations. Here we describe an operando Raman spectroscopic and electrokinetic study of two highly active OER catalysts, FeOOH-NiOOH and NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH). The data support two distinct mechanisms for the two catalysts: FeOOH-NiOOH operates by a bifunctional mechanism where the rate-determining O-O bond forming step is the OH- attack on a Fe=O coupled with a hydrogen atom transfer to a Ni-III-O site, whereas NiFe LDH operates by a conventional mechanism of four consecutive proton-coupled electron transfer steps. The experimental validation of the bifunctional mechanism enhances the understanding of OER catalysts.									68	1	0	0	7	0	68			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000597257600001	33089600

Herein, we develop a simple and efficient method for exploring high-performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts by engineering the surface structure of ferrite nanoparticles on carbon nanotube support through a reduction-engraved strategy. After the reduction treatment, abundant oxygen vacancies localized on the surface of the ultrafine ferrite nanoparticles favorably affect their electronic structure, assuring a rapid charge transfer, and expose more active sites. In 1.0m KOH solution, the reduced composites exhibit superior OER electrocatalytic activity to IrO2, affording a current density of 10mAcm(-2) at overpotentials of merely 214mV for Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4@o-MWCNT (r-CNFc), 221mV for CoFe2O4@o-MWCNT (r-CFc), and 216mV for NiFe2O4@o-MWCNT (r-NFc). It is worth mentioning that r-CNFc could afford a current density of 100mAcm(-2) at an overpotential of 256mV, which is approximately ten times higher than that of CNFc at the same overpotential (10.6mAcm(-2)). These catalysts also exhibit long-term stability evaluated by controlled-current electrolysis at least for 120h. These results demonstrate an efficient method for constructing high-performance and durable OER electrocatalysts by reducing mixed metal spinel oxides on the conductive support.									15	1	0	0	1	0	15			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000426844600028

Herein, NiFe-based catalysts with appropriate electronic conductivity and catalytic activity have been obtained through introduction of oxygen vacancies by a facile and economic NaBH4 reduction approach. The combined density functional theory calculations, physical characterization, and electrochemical studies disclose that the reductive treatment creates a high amount of oxygen vacancies, high active sites, and a low energy barrier for OER. The oxygen vacancy-rich catalyst yields a more than 2-fold increased current density (from 100 to 240 mA cm(-2)) at a low overpotential of 270 mV, accompanied by good stability under OER conditions. The approach is also broadly applicable for NiFe compounds synthesized via different methods or substrates.									171	13	0	0	5	1	173			2380-8195			WOS:000439083100007

The correlation of experimental and computational results confirms that this high activity originates from the precise M-N-2, coordination in the g-C3N4 matrix. Moreover, the reversible ORR/OER activity trend for a wide variety of M C3N4 complexes has been constructed to provide guidance for the molecular design of this promising class of catalysts.									825	47	0	0	61	0	838			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000396185700008	28221033

Moreover, its multi-stage heterostructure also endows the electrocatalyst with unique multifunctional properties, making it can realize overall water splitting under a low cell voltage of 1.57 V at 10 mA/cm2, and has long-term stability. This work demonstrates the importance of rational introduction of heteroatoms and interface/surface engineering for advanced electrocatalytic materials.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000720614400001		
J	Limburg, J; Crabtree, RH; Brudvig, GW								Kinetic analysis of the O-2-forming reaction between [Mn(III)(dpa)(2)](-) (dpa = dipicolinate) and potassium peroxomonosulfate								INORGANICA CHIMICA ACTA				297	1-2			301	306		10.1016/S0020-1693(99)00362-X				JAN 2000	2000	The O-2-evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II (PSII) carries out the four-electron oxidation of water to dioxygen. We had previously reported reactions between manganese complexes containing the ligands dipicolinate (dpa) and 2,2':6,2"-terpyridine (terpy) and oxygen atom-transfer reagents potassium peroxomonosulfate (oxone), sodium hypochlorite and dimethyldioxirane that led to homogeneous catalytic O-2 evolution. The species responsible for catalysis are the complexes of formula [(H2O)LMn(O)(2)MnL(OH2)](n+/-), where L = dpa (n = -1) or L = terpy (n = +3). In the case of the reaction of the terpy complex and hypochlorite, isotope studies showed that water is the source of oxygen atoms in the molecular oxygen evolved, so this complex is a functional model for photosynthetic water oxidation. Here, we present a kinetic analysis of the reaction between [Mn(dpa)(2)](-) and oxone discussing both the mechanism of O-2 evolution and of the side reaction that produces permanganate. The O-2-evolving reaction is first-order in manganese and second-order in oxone, with a k(obs) of 37 700 +/- 260 M-2 h(-1). MnO4- formation is first order in both manganese and oxone, with a k(obs) of 570 +/- 14 M-1 h(-1). All measurements were taken at a pH of 4.5; under this condition the rate of MnO4- formation is approximately equal to the rate of O-2 evolution, preventing the reaction from being truly catalytic at this pH. The kinetics are interpreted in terms of the reaction between a Mn=O-containing intermediate and oxone as being the key step in O-O bond formation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

In this study, a hybrid electrocatalyst of CoFe alloy and CoxN heterojunction encapsulated and anchored in N-doped carbon support (CoFe-CoxN@NC) was in situ coupled via the pyrolysis of a novel coordination polymer derived from lignin biomacromolecule. CoFe-CoxN@NC exhibited outstanding OER activity with a low overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and stability with an increment of 20 mV, comparable to commercial Ir/C. DFT calculations showed that CoxN and N-doped graphitic encapsulation can reduce the binding strength between *O and CoFe alloy, limit metal leaching and agglomeration, and improve electron transfer efficiency, considerably enhancing the OER activity and stability. In situ coupling approach for preparing alloy and nitride heterojunctions on N-doped lignin-derived carbon offers a promising and universal catalyst design for developing renewable energy conversion technologies.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0001-1541	1547-5905		WOS:000808577500001

Results from SEM and XPS analyses, respectively, indicate that the coating layer exhibits a compact structure and the oxidation state of Mn in the coating layer is +IV. The experimental activation energy for the oxygen evolution reaction, which increased linearly with increasing overpotential, is about 8 kJa <...mol(-1) at the equilibrium potential (eta=0). The electrocatalytic characteristics of the anode are discussed in terms of ligand substitution reaction mechanisms (Sn1 and Sn2). It was found that the transition state for oxygen evolution at the anode in acidic solution follows a dissociative mechanism (Sn1 reaction). The Ti/SnO2 + RuO2 + MnO2 anode in conjunction with UV illumination was used to degrade phenol solutions, where the concentration of phenol remaining was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

This work firstly reports and compares the evolution behavior and quantitative reaction mechanisms of cube Cu2O model catalyst for CC and CLC reactions. The Cu2O-CC exhibited the higher activity and stability than Cu2O-CLC. The typical characterization results suggested that the only surface unstable Cu2O was oxidized to CuO, and the excellent synergistic effect of metal oxide interface (100) between Cu+/Cu2+ and active lattice oxygen species for Cu2O-CC reaction. But, for CLC reaction, Cu2O structure was collapsed, which caused the agglomeration of CuOx species and gradual decrease of reaction stability. Three different active oxygen species (surface cycle lattice oxygen, bulk lattice oxygen, and adsorbed oxygen) and the detailed reaction pathways were proposed by the in situ IR spectroscopy, isotopic (O-18(2)) transient exchange experiments and DFT simulation. The intrinsic activity of surface cycle lattice oxygen was higher in terms of TOF (13.5 x 10(-3) s(-1)) and facile formation of (COO)-O-16-O-18 on the cubic interface of Cu2O-CC through adsorbed CO during CC process. The contribution degrees of Mars-van-Krevelen (M-K) and Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanisms for CC and CLC reactions were 76.6% and 23.4% for CC, and 89.7% and 10.3% for CLC on Cu2O catalyst, respectively.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000783883300002

Hence, to design and develop superior active and low-cost OER electrocatalyst is of significant necessary. In this study, the bimetallic cobalt-iron phosphates nanosheets (denoted as Co-Fe-P-O) with high activity toward OER has been constructed via a rapid microwave-assisted process using sodium hypophosphite and ethylene glycol as the phosphorus source and reaction solvent, respectively. Due to the structural feature of a larger electrochemical active surface area, the catalyst exerts a small overpotential of 267 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 30 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH solution. The as-prepared catalyst also shows an outstanding stability with a current density retention of 94% at a constant water oxidation for almost 10 h. All of the results suggest that the performance of the catalyst prepared in our work is better than the state-of-the-art commercial RuO2 and even can rival most of transition metal-based material.

Here, we report on epitaxial PBCO thin films showing electrocatalytic properties, with current densities of up to 10 mA/cm(2) at 1.8 V vs RHE. Dense PBCO thin films are synthesized in a disordered perovskite phase as well as in a coherently oxygen vacancy ordered (double) perovskite phase, in which oxygen vacancies are incorporated in every second CoO2-delta atomic plane along the out-of-plane direction. The transition from disordered to ordered growth occurs with temperature control during the growth process and can be directly monitored in situ by means of reflection high-energy electron diffraction. The epitaxial fabrication process allows the control of the structure and phase of the oxide catalysts, providing model systems for exploring structure property relations and atomistic processes of catalysis during the OER For all structural compositions, we demonstrate remarkably similar catalytic properties, indicating a negligible effect of the structural bulk phase on OER catalysis. Rational design routes for perovskite catalysts derived merely from bulk properties should therefore be met with suspicion.									27	0	0	0	2	0	26			2155-5435			WOS:000412795700071

Herein, we report the preparation of CoP nanoparticles embedded in N-doped mesoporous carbon via a simple yet facile route involving the polymerization of dopamine, Co salts and Si precursor, as well as the subsequent phosphidation treatment. The as-prepared catalysts not only can efficiently catalyze the HER in acidic and basic media with overpotential of 139 and 203 mV to reach current density of 10 mA cm(-2), but also favors the sluggish OER process due to the presence of cobalt oxy-hydroxide on the surface of CoP, showing overpotential of 345 mV to acquire the same current density. The efficient catalytic activities are, highly probably, attributed to the favorable mass-transfer in the nanoporous carbon, interfacial effects at nitrogen dopants enriched site, small charge transfer resistance, as well as synergistic effect between active species and underlying support. The catalysts are appealing to serve as the promising bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water-splitting with overpotential of 1.72 V to reach current density of 10 mA cm(-2).

Benefitting from the unique nanostructure, Mo-NiFe-LDH-2 exhibits a large electrochemical surface area of 63.94 cm(2). In addition, a strong electronic interaction occurs between Mo, Fe, and Ni after Mo doping, resulting in highly active Ni3+ sites. Consequently, the Mo-NiFe-LDH-2 shows high OER activity with an overpotential of 317 mV to deliver a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 44 mV dec(-1).

The modification of SWCNTs with MPcs improved the potential required for the oxygen evolution reaction in 0.1 M and 1 M KOH by lowering the potential by approximately 120 mV in comparison with unmodified SWCNTs, at a current density of 10 mA cm(-1). The onset potential of the hybrids is close to the bulk Ni electrode in 1 M KOH and significantly outperforms Ni and Ir black electrodes in 0.1 M KOH solution. Nickel, cobalt and iron phthalocyanines showed auto-activation during extended cyclic voltammetry and long-term chronoamperometric measurements in both KOH concentrations.

Herein, Ni(OH)(2) nanoplates aligned on NiAl foil (Ni(OH)(2)/NiAl) are developed by simply dealloying NiAl foil in KOH, which exhibits high electrocatalytic activity for OER with a small overpotential of 289 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) and outstanding durability with no detectable degradation during long-term operation. Furthermore, such Ni(OH)(2)/NiAl can effectively act as an active and robust hierarchical scaffold to simply electrodeposit other catalysts with intrinsically higher activity such as NiMo and NiFe nanoparticles for highly efficient HER and OER, respectively. The prepared NiFe/Ni(OH)(2)/NiAl displays superior OER catalytic activity with overpotentials of 246, 315, and 374 mV at 10, 100, and 500 mA cm(-2), respectively. While NiMo/Ni(OH)(2)/NiAl catalyst exhibits remarkable HER performance with a small overpotential of 78 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2). Consequently, the electrolysis device composed of the above two electrocatalysts demonstrates superb water splitting performance with a cell voltage of 1.59 V at 10 mA cm(-2).

The rich variety of LiMO2 compositions with the O3-type layered structure makes this class of materials an excellent test-bed for understanding the effects of the nature and oxidation states of the transition-metal ions on the OER. Accordingly, the OER behaviors of a range of LiMO2 oxide solid solutions are presented here: LiCo1-xMnxO2, LiNi1-xMnxO2, and LiCo1-xNixO2 with 0.25 <= x <= 0.7. It is found that the OER activity increases with decreasing Mn content, and the Ni-rich compositions exhibit high OER activities. Furthermore, the pre-OER potential region displays contributions from surface faradaic reactions that involve Ni and Co. The overall higher activity of the Ni- and Co-rich compositions might be due to the in situ transformation of the LiMO2 surface into a highly active electrocatalyst.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			2192-6506			WOS:000349469400019

The introduction of sulfur makes the catalyst more hydrophilic and changes the adsorption energy of the OER intermediates that is performed by density functional theory (DFT).

Nevertheless, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode is limited by the slow reaction process, which hinders the large-scale development and application of electrolysis technology. In this work, we present an electrocatalyst with superior OER performance, which attributed to the abundant active sites and good electronic conductivity. The two-dimensional CoMo Layered Double Hydroxide nanosheets are synthesized and deposited on conductive carbon nanotubes (CoMo LDH/CNTs), and then hybrid composites show better catalytic performance than their undecorated counterpart under identical conditions. Specifically, CoMo LDH/CNTs exhibit the low overpotential of 268 mV to obtain 10 mA cm-2 and satisfactory stability (more than 40 h). We emphasize that this hybridization strategy with a conductive supporting framework could design more abundant and low-cost OER electrocatalysts to minimize electrical energy consumption, thereby achieving efficient conversion between energy sources.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1361-6528		MEDLINE:36252529	36252529

At the heart of these electrolyzers are the electrocatalysts, which facilitate the cathodic and anodic reactions, with the latter oxygen evolution reaction (OER) being the most sluggish. In recent years, aerogels have become a very well-studied class of materials due to their unique properties, including very high surface area. Until now, aerogels have not been used to catalyze the OER by themselves but were mainly considered catalyst supports. Here, mixed-metal nickel-iron oxide aerogels were synthesized with a modified epoxide route synthesis and tested as OER catalysts. Depending on the Ni/Fe ratio, they show very high catalytic activity and low overpotential to reach 10 mA cm(-2) (at eta = 380 mV). This activity is beyond that of the existing state-of-the-art platinum group metal-free OER catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000860244200001

However, slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER and ORR) on air cathode significantly limit the battery performance. Herein, a facile two-step tuning strategy is investigated to convert NiCoLDH to oxygen vacancy-rich NiCo2O4 nanosheet (R-NiCo2O4-x/CC). With carefully controlled air annealing and NaBH4 treatment processes, the optimal R-NiCo2O4-x/CC exhibits enhanced OER and ORR activities compared with NiCo2O4-x/CC counterpart. Liquid and quasi-solid-state ZABs based on the binder-free R-NiCo2O4-x/CC electrode demonstrate power density and cycling stability that surpass the reference RuO2+Pt/C/CC catalyst with open-circuit voltage and peak power density of 1.486 and 1.39 V, and 88.6 and 38.6 mW cm(-2), respectively. This study provides a new approach toward high-performance catalysts for ZABs using an oxygen vacancy engineering strategy under mild conditions.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000742855800005

Here, we design a strongly coupled interface structure in Ni3Mo3N/Mo2C coated with graphitized carbon (Ni3Mo3N/Mo2C@C) by using an in-situ growth strategy. The density functional theory calculation unveil that the heterointerface of Ni3Mo3N/ Mo2C@C not only facilitates the charge transfer, but also regulates the adsorption free-energies of the reaction intermediates (*O, *OH, and *OOH), to achieve superior electrocatalytic performances for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As bifunctional catalysts, the Ni3Mo3N/Mo2C@C exhibits high HER and OER activities, with 43 mV and 220 mV overpotentials at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH electrolyte, respectively, as well as outstanding catalytic durability. This interface coupling strategy may provide a useful path to promote the electrocatalytic activities for diverse reactions in the energy field.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000788221700002

The C-MC nanostructure was prepared by pyrolyzing biomass material of catkin at 600 degrees C in N-2 atmosphere. The C-MC network exhibited hollow nanotube structure and had a large specific surface area, comprising trace nitrogen and a large amount of oxygen vacancies. It further served as the support for the growth of NiOOH nanosheets (NiOOH@C-MC), which was combined with MoS2 nanosheets by in situ growth, yielding a multicomponent electrocatalyst (MoS2@NiOOH@C-MC). By integrating the superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of MoS2, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of NiOOH, and the fast electron transfer capability of C-MC, the prepared MoS2@NiOOH@C-MC illustrated a low potential of - 250 mV for HER and 1.51 V for OER at the current density of 10 mV cm(2) . Consequently, when applied as the working electrode for driving overall water splitting in a two-electrode system, the bifunctional MoS2@NiOOH@C-MC electrocatalyst displayed a low cell voltage of 1.62 Vat the current density of 10 mA cm(2) . The present work provides a new strategy that uses biomass material for developing bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The exploration on bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution constitutes a key solution, where rational design strategies to integrate various active sites into a high-performance air cathode remain insufficient. Herein, a multiscale construction strategy is proposed to rationally direct the fabrication of bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for long-lifespan rechargeable zinc-air batteries. NiFe layered double hydroxides and cobalt coordinated framework porphyrin are selected as the active sites considering their high intrinsic activity at the molecular level, and the active sites are successively integrated on three-dimensional conductive scaffolds at mesoscale to strengthen ion transportation. Consequently, the multiscale constructed electrocatalyst exhibits excellent bifunctional performance (Delta E = 0.68 V), which is even better than that of the noble metal based benchmarks. The corresponding air cathodes endow zinc-air batteries with a reduced voltage gap of 0.74 V, a high power density of 185.0 mW cm(-2), and an ultralong lifespan of more than 2400 cycles at 5.0 mA cm(-2). This work demonstrates a feasible strategy to rationally integrate various active sites to construct multifunctional electrocatalysts for energy-related processes.									36	5	0	0	2	0	36			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000569877100040

Herein oxygen and nitrogen coordinated single copper atom active sites anchored within porous carbon electrode (sCu-ONPC) are synthesized by direct pyrolysis of adsorption of Cu2+-saturated well-cutting biomass brinjaul. This as-synthesized sCu-ONPC electrode exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performances toward ORB. with a half-wave potential value (0.79 V vs RHE) and an onset potential (0.95 V vs RHE), and OER with an overpotential of 275 mV when the current density reaches 10 mA cm(-2), thus delivering a high power density of 88.5 mW cm(-3) at 140 mA cm(-2) and excellent cycling stability when directly assembling as a Zn-air battery. Significantly, density functional theory calculation reveals that the simultaneous O and N coordinated Cu atom, especially the Cu-N3O species, possess excellent intrinsic catalytic activity for ORR and OER activities. This work offers a facile route to the design and build of efficient binder-free low-cost air electrodes for metal-air batteries.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2574-0962			WOS:000504953500036

These are usually closely related to the reversible reactions of the formation and decomposition of the discharge product Li2O2. This study presents the feasibility of ultrasonic-assisted enhancement of lithium-oxygen battery performance. Under the application of ultrasonic charging with 5:5 duty cycle and 675 W power, the rapid upward trend of charging voltage can be effectively suppressed, and the original overpotential of the lithium-oxygen battery can be reduced by 25.9%. In addition, at a limited specific capacity of 400 mAh g(-1) and a current density of 800 mA g(-1), when applying ultrasonic charging process with above ultrasonic condition every 20 cycles, the cycle life of lithium-oxygen battery with Co3O4 as the positive electrode can reach 321 cycles. Ultrasonic charging has positive effects on suppressing concentration polarization, enhancing mass transfer, and improving oxygen evolution reaction kinetics. It can effectively promote the rapid decomposition of the discharge product Li2O2, reduce the overpotential, and improve the battery cycle performance and stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000844310000002

However, conventional electrocatalytic materials often show high overpotentials and low chemical activities. Conductive polymers anchored is thought an effective strategy to solve this problem. In this work, we report a kind of novel nanosheet arrays through a facile hydrothermal and subsequent electrodeposition process. The as-obtained CoNi2S4@PEDOT-150 products possess an overpotential of 270 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 50 mA cm(-2) and 90 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. In addition, the electrode can be used as both anode and cathode for overall water splitting.

However, complete control of such efficient nitrogen-doping sites in carbon materials is difficult to realize in practice in a pyrolysis process. Here, we present maximized pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen-doped oxygen electrode via the precise use of nitrogen-containing precursors and carbonization temperature. The critical roles of pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen dopants in enhancing oxygen reaction activity are unraveled and this highly active material exhibits a remarkable half-wave potential of 0.89 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and a small potential gap of 0.78 V between ORR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 0.1 M KOH, which is one of the best to date among metal-free bifunctional electrocatalysts. Both zinc-air batteries using liquid electrolytes and the all-solid-state batteries assembled with such air cathodes exhibit excellent cycle performance and reversibility, which can be expressly observed by in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization. This nitrogen dopants engineering strategy gives an effective methodology to make full use of nanocarbon materials for their practical applications in next-generation powerful and durable energy devices.

However, conventional doping methods are meticulous and complex. Hence, S-doped NiFe-LDH (S-NiFe-LDH-t-A) driven by short-time room-temperature electrochemical activation procedure is synthesized. The NiFe-LDH prefabricated by spontaneous substrate corrosion ensures large active surface area, exposed active sites and long-term robustness. Then moderate S doping electrochemically motivated is applied to the regulation of NiFeLDH, which not only improves the bonding between metals and reaction intermediates but also induces decreased free energy, thus enhancing OER performance. Electrochemical measurements verified the low overpotential of 270 mV at 50 mA cm-2 and favorable durability for optimized S-NiFe-LDH-9-A benefited from the synergistic effect between NiFe-LDH and S species. This work provides a facile electrochemical activation strategy for anion doping, which show implications for the design of advanced catalysts.									39	1	0	0	4	0	39			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000663219500001

Elemental depth profiling revealed the bulk of the film to be metallic, which helps in improving conduction of charges, while the surface of the film was rich in CoOOH-type species to facilitate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Comparison of OER performance with boron-free samples suggests that inclusion of B helps in improving the OER rate by preventing the conversion of surface Co to stable oxides. The Co-B film achieved a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at merely 280 mV, with potentiostatic stability for 45 h in alkaline medium, highlighting its superior performance than the powder catalyst.

Surface redox activities involved on the AIROF were found to be much faster than those involved on the TDIROF. Concerning the oxygen evolution reaction, both films show a similar mechanism and specific electrocatalytic activities. The situation seems to be different for FA oxidation. In fact, on TDIROF, the oxidation of FA and the OER compete involving the same surface redox couple Ir(VI)/Ir(IV) contrary to FA oxidation on AIROF, where the Ir(V)/Ir(IV) surface redox couple is involved. Finally, electrode stability measurements have shown that contrary to TDIROF, which are very stable under anodic polarization, the AIROF are rapidly corroded under anodic treatment. This corrosion is enhanced even further in the presence of formic acid.									119	4	0	0	10	0	122			0021-891X			WOS:000267662200026

Likewise, practical rechargeable zinc-air battery testing using atmospheric air reveals superior discharge voltages obtained with LMCO/NCNT, particularly at current densities higher than 30 mA cm(-2), and significantly lower charge voltages at all current densities tested, compared to state-of-art commercial platinum on carbon catalyst In addition, very stable charge and discharge voltages of 2.2 and 1.0 V, respectively, are obtained over 60 cycles.

To establish optimal Fe/Co ratio of the catalyst, Co-Fe-P films were electrodeposited with Fe/Co ratio of 0.2, 0.4, 1.1, and 3.3. Among the prepared samples, the Co-Fe-P film with the Fe/Co ratio of 1.1 (Co-Fe-P-1.1) exhibited the highest activity for the oxygen evolution reaction, which could be attributed to the transfer of the valence electron from Co to Fe and P. To improve performance of the Co-Fe-P-1.1, a 3D porous foam structure was adopted using the electrodeposition. The Co-Fe-P foam had 94 times larger electro-chemical active surface area (ECSA) than the Co-Fe-P film with similar Fe/Co ratios of 1.1, resulting in an distinguished activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (294 mV at 10 mA/cm(2)) and hydrogen evolution reaction (73 mV at 10 mA/cm(2)) in an alkaline solution. Since the electrodeposited Co-Fe-P foam itself can be directly used as an electrode, it is free from binders, and microstructure of the electrode can be engineered by controlling the electrodeposition condition, leading to the enlarged ECSA and improved performance. Thus, the Co-Fe-P foam presented in this study offers a facile and controllable synthesis of catalyst and electrode through an easy electrodeposition process.									41	5	0	0	0	0	42			2168-0485			WOS:000431927500071

However, designing high-efficiency catalysts to match industrial requirements remains a significant challenge. An Efficient and stable OER catalyst [Mn2O3/PdO/ZnO] was prepared by a simple and cost-effective facile synthesis approach using metal acetates with the organic extract. The carbonaceous material help in improving the surface area and lowering the band gap energy (2.2 eV) of the Mn2O3/PdO/ZnO suggesting the enhanced electrochemical conductivity of synthesized nanomaterial. The catalyst was loaded on Ni-foam and has been tested for Oxyge evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an alkaline medium. The material shows higher activity toward OER with a low overpotential and Tafel slope value of 93 mV/dec at a bias of 1.65 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). The material exhibited an overpotential of 57 mV and Tafel value of 244 mV/dec toward HER which were not much satisfactory. The material offer an overpotential value of 422 mV toward OER which remains consistent even after 2000 cycle in 1M KOH electrolyte. In addition, chronoamperometry test also revealed constant oxygen evolution over 24 hours without any loss in activity.

However, replacing the noble-metal-based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with affordable and robust alternatives remains challenging to date. Herein, we report a cation-ordered double perovskite oxide, i.e., PrBa0.85Ca0.15MnFeO5+delta, with excellent stability and activity in both OER and ORR The layered crystal structure provides ordered oxygen vacancy channels and a vast amount of surface oxygen defects, while the moderate amount of iron dopant keeps the B-site cations at high oxidation state with optimal e(g) fillings. Importantly, the DFT calculations along with the advanced TEM analysis verify that the incorporation of Ca at the A-site stabilizes the perovskite structure under potential bias. Such a bifunctional catalyst shows comparable, if not better, activity relative to the state-of-the-art perovskite oxides (e.g., Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta) while demonstrating remarkably enhanced robustness. This work presents a rational approach of designing efficient, robust, and cost-effective perovskite oxide for oxygen electrocatalysis and sheds light on the influences of the crystallographic structure on the catalytic property.									73	2	0	0	2	0	74			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000407522300010

Herein, a facile solid-phase precursor pyrolysis method is used to construct N-doped carbon nanotubes encapsulating Co nanoparticles (Co@NCNT5) as a multifunctional electrocatalyst. In this method, ZIF-67 and dicyandiamide are used as the precursor and CNT growth initiator, respectively. The systematic formation process of Co@NCNTs involves a morphological evolution process from nanododecahedras, nanospheres with sparse short nanotubes to nanotubes. Owing to the synergistic effects from the inner Co nanoparticles and outer NCNTs, Co@NCNTs exhibit high multifunctional performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Furthermore, a primary zinc-air battery based on Co@NCNTs also shows high activity and stability. Therefore, Co@NCNTs will be a potential multifunctional catalyst for application in sustainable energy systems.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				1466-8033		WOS:000620282700017

How to develop highly efficient catalysts with low cost for the hydrolysis of water is a huge challenge. Herein, heterogeneous CDs/NiCo2S4/Ni3S2 nanorods were constructed on nickel foam (CDs/NiCo2S4/ Ni3S2/NF) by Co ion exchange on carbon dots (CDs) and sulfur codoped nickel foam (NF). The designed CDs/NiCo2S4/Ni3S2/NF as a self-standing electrocatalyst shows excellent electrocatalytic properties. In the hydrogen evolution reaction process, the current density can reach 10 mA cm(-2) only with the overpotential of 0.127 V. During the oxygen evolution reaction process, overpotential of 0.116 V is enough to achieve the same current density. Meanwhile, the CDs/NiCo2S4/Ni3S2/NF electrode can serve as both anode and cathode in alkaline electrolyte, and overpotential of 1.50 V can drive the overall water splitting with superior durability. Such excellent properties are mainly due to (1) a large number of exposed active sites provided by carbon dots modified transition metal chalcogenide (NiCo2S4 and Ni3S2), (2) the changed electronic structure caused by the incorporation of carbon dots and Co ions and the synergistic effect between NiCo2S4 and Ni3S2, (3) the accelerated electron transfer and mass transfer processes owing to the hierarchical structure formed by 3D nickel foam and one-dimensional CDs/NiCo2S4/Ni3S2/NF nanorods. This study can facilitate with the production of efficient and non-noble metal catalysts for overall water splitting.									32	0	0	0	0	0	32			2168-0485			WOS:000456631800086

The NiCo-BTC derived rod bundle-like NiCo2O4 owns abundant mesoporous with the size of 2.2 nm, resulting in a considerable surface area of 18.9 m(2)/g. The derived rod bundle-like NiCo2O4 exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 mol/L KOH solution, which delivered a low onset potential (1.49 V), and small Tafel slope (64.1 mV/dec) with outstanding stability.

Herein, FeNx/C catalysts are synthesized by pyrolysis of thiourea and agarose containing alpha-Fe2O3 nanoplate as Fe precursor, where alpha-Fe2O3 nanoplate can prevent the aggregation of carbon sheets to effectively improve the specific surface area during the carbonization process. The FeNx/C-700-20 catalyst displays excellent catalytic performance for both ORR and OER activity in alkaline conditions with more positive onset potential (1.1 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode) and half-wave potential, higher stability, and stronger methanol tolerance in alkaline solution, which are all superior to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. In this study, the detailed analyses demonstrate that the coexistence of Fe-based species and high content of Fe-N-x both play an important role for the catalytic activity. Furthermore, FeNx/C-700-20 as cathode catalyst in Zn-air battery possesses higher charge-discharge stability and power density compared with that of commercial Pt/C catalyst, displaying great potential in practical implementation of for the rechargeable energy devices.									125	6	0	0	5	0	124			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000440805400028

However, it still remains a challenge to control these geometric and chemical nanostructures in a single reaction process under the same conditions. Herein, an approach based on an O-2-mediated solvothermal radical reaction (OSRR) to control the physicochemical conformations of Co/N-doped carbon electrocatalysts in a single reaction is reported. Atomic Co/N-doped carbon (CoCN), nanoparticulate Co/N-doped carbon (AP-CoCN), atomic Co/N-doped hollow carbon (PCA-CoCN-1), and nanoparticulate Co/N-doped porous carbon (PCA-CoCN-2) nanostructures are effectively designed by adjusting the molecular interactions between the organic precursors and metal ions in the OSRR. The activities of the electrocatalysts depend strongly on their structures where PCA-CoCNs exhibit the most outstanding activity and stability for ORR while AP-CoCN displays the most excellent activity and stability for OER. The simulations suggest that the back side carbon of Co-pyridinic N doped nanostructures is an active site for ORR and OER. The Zn-air battery employing PCA-CoCN-1 and AP-CoCN exhibits a lower charge-discharge overpotential and greater durability than the Pt/C and RuO2 assembly. The OSRR can provide a new avenue for designing diverse carbon-based catalysts with desired structures and activities.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000526110500024

As expected, the developed electrode exhibits very low overpotentials of 68 and 230 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the electronic structure of Co2P can be tailored effectively via the N-doping effect, with the d-band center shifting to a negative position compared with that at the Fermi level, leading to optimized adsorption interaction with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) intermediates, Furthermore, a stable solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 17.9% is achieved with a solar-driven water splitting electrolyzer.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6				2666-3864		WOS:000710000200022

The results from the OER experiments reveal that Co(OH)(2)@Ni nanostructures are the best electrocatalyst with the lowest overpotential and have preserved their morphology after 24 h of chronopotentiometric test.

To further optimize electrocatalytic performance of materials, many researchers purposely design heteroatom functionalization strategy during synthesizing catalysts. Nitrogen (N) functionalization can alter the electronic structures to optimize the coordination environment of the active metal centers in the catalysts and improve the intermediate adsorption/desorption on the interface. Herein, we review the recent progress on synthetic approaches of N-functionalized catalysts for OER, including solution (small molecular complexes, metal-organic frameworks, etc. as precursors), solid-state (ball milling and chemical vapor deposition), interface, and noncovalent chemistry synthesis. Furthermore, the catalytic mechanism of N-coordinated active metal sites and the influence factors of OER performance are discussed, and the current challenges and outlook of OER catalysts with N-optimized coordination are also presented.

Based on grand canonical quantum mechanics calculations and the single-site Co atomic structure validated by in situ and ex situ spectroscopic probes, we have established a full description of the catalytic reaction kinetics for Co-TiO2 as a function of applied potential, revealing an adsorbate evolution mechanism for the OER. The computationally predicted Tafel slope and turnover frequencies exhibit exceedingly good agreement with experiment.									96	3	0	0	8	0	97			2520-1158			WOS:000598704500003

As the best-known HER and ORR electrocatalysts, Pt and its alloys have only moderate OER activity. Ruthenium and iridium oxides exhibit the highest OER activities but not as active as Pt for HER and ORR. Here, we proposed a general principle for achieving trifunctional electrocatalysis for three reactions in a single material. Using the newly-synthesized pyrazine-modified graphdiyne (PR-GDY) as an example, we demonstrated that the synergistic effect of the pyridinic nitrogen and anchored transition-metal (TM) single atoms renders highly-efficient HER/OER/ORR trifunctional electrocatalytic activity. For the Ni-doped PR-GDY, the over-potentials for HER, OER and ORR can be respectively as low as -0.05, 0.29 and 0.38 V, which are comparable or even superior to the best-known single-functional and bi-functional precious electrocatalysts. These computational results offer not only a promising trifunctional electrocatalyst but also a strategy for the design of multifunctional electrocatalysts. (C) 2020 Science China Press.

In this paper, a novel one-dimensional amorphous nickel molybdenum phosphate nanoarray (NiMoPOx) is prepared on nickel foam via two-step reations. NiMoPOx exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity than the state of the art Pt/C and RuO2. For overall water splitting reaction, NiMoPO. electrode couple achieves 1.55 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for prolonged 50 h operation in 1.0 M KOH. The excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic properties come from the insitu electrochemical surface self-tuning of NiMoPOx "precatalyst". During the self-tuning process, the surface of amorphous NiMoPOx is in-situ transformed to metallic Ni and Ni(OH)(2) nanoparticles under HER and OER, leading to the formation of special heterostructure hybrid materials. Further investigations indicate that the insitu produced metallic Ni nanoparticles favor the generatation of adsorbed H atom in water dissociation, therefore enhance the hydrogen evolution kinetics and activity. Meanwhile the in-situ formed Ni(OH)(2) nanoparticles become the actual surficial species to promote oxygen evolution reaction. This self-tuning method provides a new idea to develop high-performance electrocatalysts for some sustainable energy conversion systems, such as water splitting and metal-air batteries.									23	1	0	0	1	0	23			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000474502800027

The EQCM gold tip was characterized in H2SO4 0.05 M and HClO4 0.1 M. Subsequently, Ir0.15Sn0.85O2 powder, synthesized by a sol-gel route, was supported on the tip gold surface for investigations in the same media. The simultaneous measurements of mass variation and current density as functions of potential led to the identification of the chemical species involved in the mass transfer between the oxide and the acidic solution during the pseudo-capacitance reaction.

In this regard, searching for a highly efficient and durable OER catalyst with low cost, abundant active sites, and excellent durability is increasingly demanded. Herein, a facile one-pot hydrothermal method that using urea as pH regulator is demonstrated to engineer nanobundle-like CoNi layered double hydroxides (CoNi LDHs) with high surface areas and rich oxygen vacancies. As a result, by virtue of the nanobundle-like structure, abundant oxygen vacancies, as well as the modified electronic structures, the optimized Co1Ni0.3 LDHs can deliver the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) with the overpotentials of only 266 mV, much superior than those of Ir/C, Co(OH)(2), and Ni(OH)(2) catalysts. More importantly, the resultant Co1Ni0.3 LDHs also possesses excellent stability catalytic activity without negligible activity decay for at least 22 h. Our work not only establishes a potential OER electrocatalyst, but also open up a new avenue for the design and development of highly active electrocatalysts with controlled shapes.

Material surface defects with high-energy hanging bonds possess superb intrinsic reactivity, whose actual performance is limited by the dimension and conductivity of the electrocatalyst. Herein we propose a surface defect-rich perovskite electrocatalyst through a p-block metal regulation concept to achieve high performance for oxygen evolution. As a typical p-metal, Sn4+ dissolves from the solid phase from model SnNiFe perovskite nanodots, resulting in abundant surface defects with superior water oxidation performance. An oxygen pool model and a fusion-evolution mechanism are therefore proposed for the in-depth understanding of p-block metal regulation and the oxygen evolution reaction.

J	Chang Jing; Cui Dejie								Thermodynamic and Kinetic Analysis of Ca-based Oxygen Carrier in Chemical-Looping Combustion								International Journal of Chemical Reactor Engineering				8				30 pp.	30 pp.						Feb. 2010	2010	Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) is a promising technology to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) inherently and conveniently without the additional apparatus. At present, for some metal oxide oxygen carriers, the high costs and the positive hazards to the environment inhibit the developing of CLC systems. The feasibility of using CaSO4 oxygen carrier in the CLC system is studied in this paper. Through the thermodynamic analysis, the carbon deposition and the sulfur evolution are studied in the reaction between CaSO4 and a typical syngas. In addition, providing that hydrogen (H2) is fed as the gaseous fuel in the CLC system, the kinetic analysis is investigated on the reduction of CaSO4 by H2 and the oxidation of calcium sulfide (CaS) by oxygen (O2) through the thermo-gravimetric apparatus (TGA). The kinetic models are built on the reduction and the oxidation of the oxygen carrier. The results calculated from the models agree well with the experimental data. Finally, the possible reaction mechanisms for the reduction and the oxidation are explored.									0	0	0		0	0	0			1542-6580			INSPEC:11762445

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a pivotal half reaction, is seriously limited in its practical applications due to its sluggish kinetics and thus an excellent electrocatalyst for OER is urgently required. In this paper, we design a novel Co(3)O(4)nanomesh (Co3O4NMs) with high density grain boundaries (GBs), which functions as a highly efficient and steady OER electrocatalyst. The optimal Co3O4NMs-500 can achieve a low overpotential of 295 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and a small Tafel slope of 31 mV dec(-1), which exceeds the commercial Ir/C, as well as the majority of other catalysts reported in the literature. The Co3O4NMs-500 also exhibit promising durability, with a negligible decline in activity after 18 h of operation. Detailed studies indicate that the presence of GBs leads to more exposed active sites and the enhanced adsorption of intermediate species on Co3O4NMs-500, thereby improving the OER's catalytic activity. This work not only relates to the activity-GBs relationship, but also opens up a unique perspective for the design of the next generation of electrocatalysts.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000562274300001	32717726

Herein a hybrid composite, FeNi2Se4 nanoparticles supported on nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide (FeNi2Se4-NrGO) is reported as an efficient and dependable bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions (OER and ORR, respectively) under alkaline conditions. While FeNi2Se4 nanoparticles themselves show good catalytic activity for water oxidation, the constructed hybrid nanocomposite with NrGO as the supporting matrix show enhanced catalytic activity with a small overpotential of 170 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope of 62.1 mV per decade, and high current density. The ORR catalytic activity of the nanocomposite catalyst is also good with an onset potential of 0.93 V. This is possibly due to the synergistic chemical coupling effects between the FeNi2Se4 and NrGO matrix. Chronoamperometric studies show that the catalyst is stable under conditions of continuous O-2 evolution and reduction with very less degradation. Apart from reporting highly efficient OER-ORR bifunctional catalyst, this study also provides more proof for the effect of anion coordination on the catalyst performance, as well as the synergistic role of nanoscale interactions between the catalyst particles and graphene matrix to enhance catalytic activity.									24	1	0	0	0	0	24			2366-7486			WOS:000423911200007

The design and synthesis of efficient, durable, low-cost, and earth-abundant electrocatalysts for OER is of great urgency. To achieve the rapid synthesis of untrathin two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials and improve their electrocatalytic performance, a new strategy has been developed to grow amorphous cobalt-iron nanosheet arrays directly onto the surface of the macroporous iron foam substrates. This method requires significantly shorter reaction times (about 5 min) at room temperature compared to the conventional high-temperature hydrothermal reaction which requires a few hours. The as-prepared cobalt-iron nanosheets acting as oxygen electrode exhibits high OER activity, which is capable of delivering current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) and 500 mA cm(-2) at over-potential of 208 mV and 298 mV, respectively.

The hierarchical nanostructure possesses a high specific surface area and abundant metal sites, which are beneficial for electrocatalytic reactions.

According to the characterization results, the OER performance is improved by the synergistic action of bimetals and the generation of hydroxides/oxyhydroxides.

The La-Co citrate complex was mixed a porous SBA-15 silica template, and then, calcinated at 650 degrees C to prepare a LaCoO3/SBA-15 composite. Highly porous LaCoO3 was prepared by treating this composite with NaOH to remove the SBA-15 silica template. The obtained LaCoO3 showed a very rough surface, high surface area, and relatively small particle size compared with LaCoO3 prepared by the sol-gel method. The catalytic performance of the highly porous LaCoO3 for the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions was electrochemically measured in alkaline solution. LaCoO3 prepared by the nanocasting exhibited higher cell performance than that prepared by sol-gel method due to its larger surface area.					4th International Conference on Advanced Electromaterials (ICAE) / Symposium 7 on Advanced Materials and Devices for Hydrogen Fuel Cell and Electrolysis Technologies4th International Conference on Advanced Electromaterials (ICAE) / Symposium 7 on Advanced Materials and Devices for Hydrogen Fuel Cell and Electrolysis Technologies	NOV 21-24, 2017NOV 21-24, 2017		Jeju, SOUTH KOREAJeju, SOUTH KOREA	6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1385-3449	1573-8663		WOS:000454527500012

Co3O4 nanocrystals have great potential as OER catalysts, and research efforts on improving the catalytic activity of Co3O4 are currently underway in many laboratories. Herein, CoFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets were directly grown on the active Co3O4 substrate to form nanohybrid electrocatalysts for OER. The CoFe LDH/Co3O4(6:4) nanohybrid exhibited superior catalytic performance with a low overpotential and a small Tafel slope in alkaline solution. The outstanding performance of the CoFe LDH/Co3O4(6:4) nanohybrid was primarily owing to the synergistic effects induced by the strongly coupled interface between CoFe LDH and Co3O4; this feature enhanced the intrinsic OER catalytic activity of the nanohybrid and favored fast charge transfer. Compared with other Co3O4-based catalysts, the nanohybrid shows advantages and offers a feasible avenue for improving the activity of Co3O4-based catalysts.									18	2	0	0	0	0	18			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000479334700001	31274234

The nature of the orbitals involved in the formation of the oxygen-oxygen bond by these complexes is examined. The formation of the oxygen-oxygen bond occurs by the interaction of the d(x)(2)-y(2)* orbital of metal with the sigma*-orbital of the hydroxide in the case of [(Co-V(TPA-alpha F-3)(O)OH](2+), while, in the case of [(Co-V(TPA-alpha F-3)(O))](3+), the d(z)(2)*-orbital accepted the electron from the hydroxide. The activation barrier for the oxygen-oxygen bond formation by the penta coordinated complex is lower than that of the hexa-coordinated complex. The release of oxygen through both the catalytic processes has nearly equal activation free energies. From the spin density analysis, we observe that the oxo-complexes are stabilized by sharing the spin density on the nitrogen atoms with fluorine atoms of the modified TPA ligand. Comparing the four-proton and four-electron process of the catalytic cycle with both catalytic species, it is found that the penta-coordinated complex ([(Co-V(TPA-alpha F-3)(O))](3+)) requires a lower activation free energy barrier than the hexa-coordinated complex [Co-V(TPA-alpha F-3)(O)OH](2).									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2398-4902			WOS:000635682300001

The NSGC material showed high bi-functional catalytic activity due to the synergistic effect of co-doping of sulfur and nitrogen, as well as the presence of a hierarchical porous structure. The enhanced bi-functional catalytic activity of NSGC facilitated the efficient formation and decomposition of Li2O2 on the air cathode. The lithium-oxygen cell assembled with the NSGC-based air cathode delivered a high initial discharge capacity of 11 431 mA h g(-1) and exhibited good cycling stability. The hybrid structure consisting of mesoporous carbon with co-doped graphene nanosheets can be an effective strategy to improve the round-trip efficiency and cycle life of lithium-oxygen batteries.									67	4	0	0	7	0	68			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000360490600017

However, the development of such promising technologies is hindered by the lack of electrocatalysts with low-cost, high-efficient, and robust stability. 2D VSe2 and SnSe2 hold great application potentials in the energy-related fields yet face daunting challenges in terms of large-scale synthesis. Herein, a gram-scale and high-yield strategy is designed with tetradecylamine (TDA) assistance for synthesizing 2D VSe2 and SnSe2. The cooperativity of TDA with V4+ (Sn4+) cations and its stabilization to (100) facets of products contribute to the formation of ultrathin VSe2 nanosheets with abundant wrinkles and SnSe2 nanoflowers with hierarchical structures, which deliver excellent hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction performances. Significantly, a record-breaking sulfion oxidation reaction efficiency in 2D VSe2 is uncovered, and the current density is one order of magnitude larger than that of commercial Pt/C catalyst. This work presents a significant breakthrough for scalable synthesize 2D electrocatalysts and provides a new paradigm for sustainable hydrogen generation and water purification.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-7350			WOS:000779169200001

One of the key reactions is electrochemical water splitting to generate green hydrogen which ideally could be directly integrated with a wind or solar electricity source. However, alkaline electrolysers suffer from significant degradation in performance if they are rapidly powered down under reduced sunlight conditions when directly coupled with a solar cell due to reverse current flow. In this work we address this issue by creating a truly bifunctional electrode material that is switchable between the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The synthesis method is simple whereby a Pt electrode is electrochemically activated and then immersed in a nickel nitrate solution to electrolessly deposit Ni on the surface. When this electrode is electrochemically cycled, it creates an active Pt-Ni alloy at the Pt surface. Importantly, this electrocatalyst is switchable between both reactions without loss of activity as evidenced by an accelerated stress test over a 24 h period. An added advantage is that this Pt-Ni electrocatalyst is also more active than Pt for the oxygen reduction reaction which opens up its applicability in fuel cells. Finally, to demonstrate the multifunctionality of this Pt-Ni material, ethanol and ammonia oxidation is demonstrated which also shows better performance than Pt.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			2196-0216			WOS:000588728200011

Over the years, developing oxygen electrode catalysts with high activity and low cost remains a great challenge, despite tremendous efforts. Here, NixCo1-x(OH)(2) is used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The effect of its compositions (x = 1, 0.55, 0) and morphologies (including both multilayer and single-layer NixCo1-x(OH)(2)) on catalytic activity is studied systematically in order to optimize the oxygen-electrochemical performance of 3d-M (M = Ni and Co) metal hydroxides. Our results show that the compositions of NixCo1-x(OH)(2) has a great influence on overpotentials by comparing multilayer Co(OH)(2), Ni0.55Co0.45(OH)(2), and Ni(OH)(2) for OER. Multilayer Ni(OH)(2) exhibits the lowest overpotential of 324 mV at the current density of 5 mA/cm(2). Moreover, the overpotential could be greatly lowered by using single-layer NixCo1-x(OH)(2). Single-layer Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet manifests 71 mV overpotential decrease (5 mA/cm(2)) and a factor of 14 turnover frequency increase as compared to multilayer Co(OH)(2) for OER. As for ORR, multilayer Co(OH)(2) shows the best activity among multilayer NixCo1-x(OH)(2). Similar to OER, single-layer NixCo1-x(OH)(2) demonstrates enhanced ORR activity over multilayer NixCo1-x(OH)(2). Single-layer Co(OH)(2) exhibits the best catalytic activity and 3.7 electrons are transferred during oxygen reduction process. The successful identification of the composition and morphology effect of 3d metal hydroxides on electrocatalytic performance provides the foundation for rational design of active sites for high-performance catalyst for both OER and ORR.									100	5	0	0	5	0	101			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000338979900032	24915609

Despite the significant efforts in developing heteroatoms doped metal-free electrocatalysts with enhanced electrocatalytic activity, few studies focus on their bifunctional activities for ORR and OER due to the unclear catalytic mechanism and complicated active sites configurations. Herein, a series of nitrogen and phosphate co-doped carbon-based catalysts (NP/C) are successfully synthesized via a precursor modulation strategy. In this method, 5-aminouracil, 2, 6-diaminopyridine and 1, 3-diaminobenzene are selected to modulate pyridinic N (N-P), graphitic N (N-G) and pyrrolic N (N-PY) sites, respectively, while phytic acid is used as P sites. The results demonstrate that the N and P co-doped graphene with N-P+N-G+P configuration shows increased ORR performance, and on the other hand, the N-P+N-PY+P configuration enhances OER. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation demonstrates that different NP configurations formed by precursor modulation induce different electronic structure on surrounding carbon atoms, providing a possibility to manipulate intermediates energy in reaction pathway for ORR and OER. This study sheds new light on revealing the intrinsic correlation between active site configurations and catalytic bifunctional activity and selectivity of graphene based electrocatalysts for oxygen redox reactions.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			2196-0216			WOS:000667398700001

Rapidly growing research interests are focused on carbon materials as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which are critical for sustainable energy technologies including fuel cells, metal-air batteries, and water electrolyzers. A number of papers in this area have been published. However, there is no systematic review yet covering all the general methods to boost carbon-based electrocatalysts for ORR/OER/HER, and reporting their most recent progress. To eliminate the gap, this contribution gives a timely and comprehensive review of such a rapidly growing field of great significance. This review starts with a brief introduction regarding the fundamentals of carbon-based ORR/OER/HER electrocatalysts and proceeds to summarize various synthesis methods of state-of-the-art carbon materials. Subsequently, the most popular strategies to optimize electrocatalytic properties of carbons are thoroughly reviewed. In addition to metal-free carbons, advances regarding hybridized and self-supported carbon electrocatalysts are discussed. This comprehensive review not only conveys the most recent research progress, but also provides essential ideas and methods that guide the design of high-performance carbon-based electrocatalysts, contributing to their large-scale adoption in sustainable energy applications.									112	4	0	0	5	0	114			0079-6425	1873-2208		WOS:000599502800001

Herein, we present an efficient OER electrocatalyst in the form of thin (Fe,Ni)(9)S-8 nanosheets (FNS NSs) anchored on a three-dimensional (3D) conductive substrate of Fe/Fe3O4 nanoislands/carbon cloth (Fe NIs/CC). The resulting electrode exhibits an impressive OER performance with a low overpotential of 147 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 29.8 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH alkaline solution. The enhanced performance is ascribed to the thin nanosheet structure with ample active sites, the high conductivity of the substrate, and the 3D structure, which endow the electrode with a large specific surface area and more catalytic active sites. Study of the kinetic process reveals that the incorporation of Fe from the substrate can reduce the kinetic barrier of OER, allowing for a faster reaction rate.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2196-0216			WOS:000621089600014

Herein we demonstrate that the low -crystallinity mesoporous spinel CoGa2O4 oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC), exhibiting excellent bulk electrocatalytic stability and activity for oxygen-evolving reaction (OER), obviously improved water oxidization on a-Fe2O3 photoanode. Low crystallinity not only balances the stability and activity for ECs themselves but facilitates formation of adjustable Schottky junctions between ECs and SCs. Those would contribute to surface state passivation and photogenerated hole extraction, leading to lower onset potential and larger photocurrent. Thus, our finding suggests that low crystallinity could serve as a beneficial feature of ECs to achieve efficient PEC water splitting, owing to its preponderant tendency for the improvement of interface reaction kinetics.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000376825800040	27142693

This paper reports well-defined single-layer Pt (Pt-SL) clusters anchored on ultrathin TiO2 nanosheets-as a new frontier in electrocatalysis. The structural evolution of Pt-SL/TiO2 via self-assembly of single Pt atoms (Pt-SA) is systematically recorded. Significantly, the Pt atoms of Pt-SL/TiO2 possess a unique electronic configuration with Pt-Pt covalent bonds surrounded by abundant unpaired electrons. This Pt-SL/TiO2 catalyst presents enhanced electrochemical performance toward diverse electrocatalytic reactions (such as the hydrogen evolution reaction and the oxygen reduction reaction) compared with Pt-SA, multilayer Pt nanoclusters, and Pt nanoparticles, suggesting an efficient new type of catalyst that can be achieved by constructing single-layer atomic clusters on supports.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000657364900001	34080772

Herein, we report a novel electrocatalyst by deco-rating silver (Ag) nanoparticles (NPs) onto Ni(OH)2 (NSs) towards electrocatalyzing oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The presence of Ag NPs can effectively promote the charge transfer because of the improved conductivity. More importantly, surface plasmons are generated in the Ni(OH)2/Ag composite under the light irradiation, providing hot carriers which can not only accelerate the reaction kinetics by lowering the activation energy and charge transfer resistance, but also participate in the electrocatalytic reaction to further boost the activity. With the assistance of surface plasmon, the OER performance of Ni(OH)2/Ag is significantly enhanced compared with pristine Ni(OH)2 counterpart. This work offers a strategy to design electrocatalysts and demonstrates the importance of surface plasmon to the enhancement of OER activity.(c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The systematic investigations on various TM-TCNQ structures revealed that Ni-TCNQ monolayer exhibits best catalytic activity towards OER. At equilibrium potential (1.23 Vvs RHE), the free energy profile of Ni-TCNQ monolayer for different reaction intermediates is not completely downhill which points out that water could not be oxidized by the photo-generated holes at that potential. However, at and above 1.71 V, all the OER reaction steps on Ni-TCNQ surface is found to be thermodynamically downhill, measuring a low onset overpotential, ca. 0.48 V in acidic media (pH=0). The estimated overpotential for other TM-TCNQ structures are comparatively higher to promote energy-efficient OER activity. The excellent performance of Ni-TCNQ monolayer as OER catalyst were explained in terms of volcano plot, scaling diagram, d- band centre model, band structure and charge analysis.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2365-6549			WOS:000612107500014

A Fenton reaction was adopted to oxidize carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and FeOOH flakes were generated on the CNTs as reaction proceeded. The highly conductive CNT "branches" ensure rapid electron transmission and compensate for low conductivity of the FeOOH "leaves". Meanwhile, ultrathin FeOOH "leaves" growing on CNT "branches" expose sufficient numbers of active sites for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Density functional theory (DFT) computational results indicate that FeOOH@CNTs exhibit better OER catalytic performance than FeOOH. To achieve water splitting, FeOOH@CNTs were deposited on nickel foam as an anode, with platinum (Pt) sheet used as a cathode.

The OER activity of cubic BaZrxFe1-xO3-delta (0.05 <= x <= 0.2) is higher than that of the parent BaFeO3-delta with a monoclinic structure and close to that of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF), indicating cubic perovskite structure is favorable to the OER, and Fe ions are active for the reaction. Moreover, for cubic BaZr0.15Fe0.85O3-delta samples, the OER performance is closely related to the ratio of Fe4+ to Fe3+, which was tuned by treating BaZr(0.15)Fe(0.8)5O(3-delta) powders at 500 degrees C for 5 h at different atmospheres, such as O-2, air, Ar and 5% H-2/Ar mixture.

Analysis of the impedance spectra revealed a dependency of the electric double layer capacity and the adsorption pseudocapacitance, due to reaction intermediates, on electrolyte composition. The pseudocapacitance is a function of electrode potential and electrolyte composition, indicating the surface coverage by the reaction intermediates depends on these parameters. Tafel slope data support primary water discharge as rate determining step of the OER and EOP electrode processes. EOP current efficiency data (Phi(EOP)) show pure electrolytes lead to maximum O-3 production when compared to mixed electrolytes. According to the theoretical analysis of the electrode mechanism, this behaviour is a consequence of the reduction in surface concentration of the active centres leading to EOP caused by anion adsorption.									60	7	0	0	2	1	62			0103-5053	1678-4790		WOS:000239616800016

In this study, the new Ag-decorated Co-based hydroxides nanosheets with good performance as well as gram-scale yield are prepared by a selective reduction oxidation method in virtue of the different stability of metal in air. The doping of silver obviously raises the electrical conductivity of the catalysts. Due to the synergistic reaction of the high electrical conductivity and the original active sites, the overpotential of the as-prepared Ag-decorated Co(OH)(2) nanosheets is as low as 270 mV at 10 mA/cm(2). Compared to the pure Co(OH)(2) nansheets, the overpotential decreased about 80 mV at the same current density. Especially, different from the general preparation methods, this process can be carried out at room temperature and does not need any strict condition. And the gram-scale output gives this method potential for industrial production.									22	1	0	0	1	0	22			2168-0485			WOS:000446413100090

Highly stable bifunctional catalyst for Zn-Air batteries: The effect of a nitrated carbon support on Co3O4 activity								JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES				453						227834	10.1016/j.jpowsour.2020.227834				MAR 31 2020	2020	The use of Co3O4 as electrocatalyst in Zn-air batteries has been extensively studied. However, electrical rechargeability has only been achieved by combining metal oxides with precious metals or using a second electrode/electrolyte to promote the oxygen evolution reaction. In this work, we report efficient catalytic activity of Co3O4 for both, the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reaction by fusing Co3O4 particles to a nitrated carbon support. The functionalized carbon matrix improves not only the carbon wettability, but also provides acidic sites and carbon-containing functional groups. This synergistic configuration enhances the reaction kinetics especially for the oxygen evolution reaction. The electrochemical characterization demonstrated lower overpotential and higher stability over 160 cycles for the Co3O4 catalyst attached to the nitrated carbon matrix compared to the pristine carbon matrix. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrated 21 times lower degradation for the functionalized air-cathode at 2 mA cm(-2), 12.4 times lower degradation at 5 mA cm(-2), and 1.15 times lower degradation at 10 mA cm(-2). Although further work is required, the low-cost process and the electrochemical performance of this catalyst represent considerable progress towards the development of rechargeable and flexible Zn-air batteries.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000523641800007

The AQS/S exhibits high crystalline structure and abundant S defects. Density of state calculation shows that AQD has stable internal bonding and easy external bonding with metals, conducive to the dispersion of metal reaction sites, ensuring excellent activity and high stability.

J	Cartagena, Santiago; Calderon, Jorge A.								High performance of electrochemically modified-polypropylene electrodes for alkaline water splitting								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				407						139884	10.1016/j.electacta.2022.139884				MAR 1 2022	2022	Green hydrogen production by electrolysis is currently a promising alternative to reduce the environmen-tal impact of energy production and storage. The electrode substrate plays an important role in the cat-alytic performance of water splitting for efficient and low-cost hydrogen production. In this work a novel substrate was developed using nickel electroless plating over a non-woven polypropylene (PP) sheet, without the use of toxic pretreatments and costly activators, thereby reducing the cost and increasing the efficiency and safety of the process. This novel substrate exhibits larger capacitance than nickel foam (NF) and, with the application of a catalytic coating of NiFeP, the overpotentials for the electrolysis re-actions were lower than NF at 30 mA cm(-2), being 0.263 and 0.273 V for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 0.150 and 0.199 V for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for NiFeP/NiP/PP and NiFeP/NF electrodes, respectively. The results show the great potential of non-woven polypropylene electrodes for water splitting, as well as other possible applications. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, we study the influence of different particle sizes of LiMn2O4 on the OER in a sodium hydroxide electrolyte. The product currents of manganese corrosion and oxygen evolution were obtained by rotating ring disk electrodes (RRDE). Physical characterization by various methods supports identical surface chemistry and microstructure of the pristine powders. We obtained similar oxygen current densities of 40(14) mu A cm(ECSA)(-2) and 26(5) mu A cm(ECSA)(-2) for micro-and nano-sized particles at 1.68 V vs. RHE. However, the total current densities differed drastically and while the micro-powder had a high disk current density of 205(2) mu A cm(ECSA)(-2), its faradaic efficiency was only 25%. In contrast, the faradaic efficiency of the nanopowder was at least 75%. We hypothesize that a Mn redox process may occur in the bulk in parallel and possibly in combination with oxygen evolution on the surface based on the observed difference between the total and product current densities. Knowledge of the product currents is crucial for distinguishing the mechanisms of corrosion and catalysis and for designing better catalysts with high faradaic efficiency.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2398-4902			WOS:000482057500033

As a candidate of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the electrooxidation of biomass platform chemicals instead of a petroleum source offers a sustainable and atom-economic avenue toward organic oxygenates, with additional benefits when coupled with renewable electricity driven processes. This highlight article describes the representative examples in this nascent area, including oxidative dehydrogenation, coupling, and cleavage. We classify the examples into inner-sphere and outer-sphere electrode reactions based on the classical electrocatalysis concept for better understanding of the reaction mechanism. Moreover, we highlight the recent progress in oxidative biomass electrorefining via inner-sphere anodic reactions, which are strongly dependent on the nature of the electrode material. Particularly, the understanding of the formation of reactive oxygen species, adsorption of substrates, and reconstruction of anode materials is presented.

Thereby, rational design of those catalysts is an urgent topic that must be addressed. Herein, an effective strategy is demonstrated to be beneficial to the formation of hierarchical nitride phosphide hybrid with abundant oxygen vacancies. This hybrid catalyst exhibits an excellent OER catalytic performance, as demonstrated by an ultralow Tafel slope of 41 mV.dec(-1) and an overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution, which is superior to those of the pure nitride, phosphide, and the commercial IrO2 catalysts. The outstanding catalytic performance can be attributed to the specific heterojunction structure, accessible active sites, and abundant oxygen vacancies, which can facilitate the charge transport and the release of the O-2 bubbles. This study not only provides a facile strategy for constructing surface oxygen vacancies onto phosphide/nitride hybrid, but also exhibits an insight into the nature of hierarchical electrocatalyst with multiple active sites.									27	1	0	0	1	0	27			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000465365900005

Herein, we ingenious report a one-step reaction strategy synthesis of CoFe/CP grown on three-dimensional (3D) nanoarray carbon paper (CP) containing non-precious metals for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with low-cost and unique hierarchical porous structure. This amorphous CoFe/CP hybrid exhibits commendable electrocatalytic performance in the OER process, requiring only overpotential of 278 mV to achieve 10 mAcm(-)(2) in 1.0 M KOH solution and a lower Tafel slope of 49.12 mVdec(-1). In addition, this sample shows a long-term durability even at 200 mAcm(-)(2) without obvious decay, which attributes to peculiar multistage graded nano structure and the change of composition at the interface of CP. Therefore, the remarkable OER activity can provide a new strategy to construct potential candidates, which will replace the state-of-the-art precious metals for OER in the future.

J	JURSINIC, PA; DENNENBERG, RJ								THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CAPACITY TO EVOLVE OXYGEN AND THE VARIABLE FLUORESCENCE OF CHLOROPHYLL AFTER MICROSECOND ILLUMINATION IN CHLORELLA, PEA LEAVES AND PEA THYLAKOIDS								BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA				1183	2			281	291		10.1016/0005-2728(93)90229-9				DEC 7 1993	1993	The relationship between the capacity to evolve oxygen following a flash of a few microseconds duration and the variable fluorescence of chlorophyll was determined in Chlorella, leaf disks of peas, and thylakoids of pea leaves. It was found that this relationship is linear in intact plant material, while it is nonlinear in thylakoids. However, in thylakoids, the recovery of the capacity to evolve oxygen does not track the decay of the variable yield of Chi alpha fluorescence. This nonlinear relationship in thylakoids results from a reduced rate in the oxygen evolution reaction with no change in the decay of the variable yield of Chl alpha fluorescence. From a new application of the matrix analysis method to oxygen flash yields, the, S-1(')-->S-2, S-2(')-->S-3 and S-3(')-->S-4-->S-0 transitions are found to be slowed or delayed in pea thylakoids and this underlies the slower rate of the recovery of the capacity to evolve oxygen in thylakoids. It is concluded that in intact cells the Q(A)(-)Q(B)(-) --> Q(A)Q(B)(-) reaction was rate-limiting for the recovery of the capacity to evolve oxygen, the equal energy-transfer hypothesis and the sequential double-hit model are valid in pea leaves and that the apparent invalidity in thylakoids is actually due to slowing of reaction steps in the oxygen evolution mechanism.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0006-3002			WOS:A1993MP93400005	8268194

In particular, electrocatalysts with superior light ab-sorption ability is likely to show an excellent electrocatalytic performance under light irradiation. Herein, a composite consisting of NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) and carbon is prepared as an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Compared to the pristine NiFe LDH,carbon supported NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH@C) composite exhibits an enhanced light harvesting under light irradiation, not only increasing the local temperature of electrocatalyst but also lowering the charge transfer resistance during the OER reaction process. Consequently, the photothermal effect enables NiFe LDH@C composite to facilitate the charge transport and accelerate the reaction ki-netics, thereby showing an improved OER performance in comparison to neat NiFe LDH.

The composition, structure and morphology of the composite electrode materials were investigated by X-ray diffraction(XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS), scanning electron microscopy(SEM) analyses and double layer capacitance methode. The results indicate that porosity, roughness and electrochemically effective area of the composite electrode surface are increased because of the embedded nano-WO3. Then, the composite electrodes were used as anodes. for oxygen evolution reaction(OER). The activities for the OER of the composites were explained by recording linear scanning voltammograms and Tafel plots. In contrast with the PbO2 electrode without nano-WO3, oxygen evolution onset potentials of the composite electrodes become lower, the overpotentials for oxygen evolution of composite electrodes are decreased, and the OER activities are improved significantly. The overpotential for oxygen evolution at the composite electrode could be lowered by approximately 300 mV compared to that of PbO2 electrode without nano-WO3.									2	1	0	0	0	0	3			0251-0790			WOS:000347669400022

It was demonstrated that the cathode had a favorable suitability for this system owing to the excellent performance presented on Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Cyclic voltammetry (CV). An optimal condition was obtained by response surface methodology (RSM) including pH of 6.7, current density of 13.0 A m(-2), membrane flux of 82.9 L m(-2) h(-1), and CB/Fe of 6.2:1.

Effects of OER on the degradation of flutriafol via Ti/RuO2 and Ti/SnO2-Sb tubular anodes were further interpreted by the gas production rate and the H-2/O-2 value. High oxygen utilization of 78.8% was acquired when Ti/RuO2 anode served as a sufficient oxygen provider. The electrocatalytic oxygen cycle, a key loop process, was firstly interpreted in this system, which achieved a great comprehensive electrocatalytic effect with the simplest operation and had a 74.5% removal of flutriafol in the verified experiment.

Whereas, the performance of the battery is dependent on the catalyst on the air cathode. Efficient catalysts can advance the kinetics of oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution (ORR/OER) reactions. Polydopamine is a commonly used carbon source with a simple and non-toxic synthetic route. Here, the N, S-codoped carbon composite is prepared by carbonizing the mixture of polydopamine/sodium dodecyl sulfate precursors. The obtained sample displays an onset potential of 0.876 V vs. RHE, a half wave potential of 0.805 V, and a current retention of 94% after 20000s chronoamperometric response. Meanwhile, it shows a good OER catalytic property with the overpotential of 0.545 V. Owing to the favorable dual function catalytic ability of the sample, the sample can be used as an air-cathode catalyst to construct rechargeable Zn-air batteries. The battery exhibits an open circuit voltage of 1.526 V and a 54.1% round trip efficiency. Moreover, it also presents satisfactory durability and benign charge and discharge stability over long cycles. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

During the OER, we observed the insertion of large cations (Na+, K+, and Cs+) into delithiated LCO from the corresponding electrolyte solutions. The deep intercalation of hydrated Na+ and K+ resulted in significant structural transformations of delithiated LCO. In addition, the intercalated cations and remaining Li+ determined the average Co valence states in the LCO catalysts. Characteristic analyses showed that the increased Co valence state and Co-O covalency enhanced OER activity (LiOH < NaOH < KOH). In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported the formation of OER active sites as K+ was partially intercalated. In contrast, the superior OER activity obtained after Cs+ insertion entailed a different process. A sharp rise in the OER activity at a high pH and bent edges of oxide layers imposing surface tensile strain supported the lattice-oxygen-mediated OER. The original LCO bulk structure is mostly preserved with Cs+ insertion, offering better catalytic stability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000787360500001

In order to prevent moisture intrusion from ambient air, a hydrophobic electrolyte is then designed and the moisture content in the electrolyte exposed to ambient air is greatly suppressed, to less than 1 wt% at 30 degrees C and 90% RH (relative humidity). Charge and discharge tests using the hydrophobic electrolyte are reversible for several cycles even in O-2 with a RH of 28%. This approach for enhancing the hydrophobicity of the electrolyte, and thus the inherent equilibrium moisture content, for the Li-air battery demonstrates the possibility for improved stability to ambient moisture.									24	1	0	0	3	0	24			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000394940100016

Among the oxides tested, Pr0.2Ca0.8Mn0.1Fe0.9O3 gave the highest electrode performances, e.g., current densities of 275 mA/cm(2) (for oxygen reduction) and 225 mA/cm(2) (for oxygen evolution) at -300 and +650 mV vs. Hg/HgO, respectively. The electrode performances were found to depend on both the catalytic activity of the oxides for H2O2 decomposition reaction and the amounts of oxygen desorbed from the oxides.

However, sluggish oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) kinetics and poor mass transport are two key issues that hinder the performance of Zn-air batteries. Herein, a facile strategy is reported to prepare 3D holey N-doped graphene (3D HNG) with the aid of molten salts for boosting the performance of ORR/OER-driven Zn-air batteries. The as-prepared HNG shows a hierarchical porous framework structure with a 1:1 ratio of pyridinic to graphitic N. Owing to the matched N catalytic active sites and the special pore structure, 3D HNG displays super bifunctional electrocatalytic activity toward both ORR and OER. Specifically, rechargeable Zn-air batteries fabricated with this electrocatalyst show excellent discharge capacity, rechargeability, and round-trip efficiency. Density functional theory (DFT) computations further reveal that armchair-graphitic N and zigzag-pyridinic N are more favorable for ORR and OER, respectively. By combining these two components, the mixed structure displays the lowest overpotentials of 0.47 and 0.36 V for ORR and OER, respectively, comparable to the theoretical values of Pt and RuO2. This work provides a new strategy for optimizing N-doped carbon materials for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts.									57	4	0	0	1	0	59			2366-9608			WOS:000446671200015

The synergistic effect between alpha-MnO2 and Sr2Ni0.4Co1.6O6 was responsible for the improved catalytic activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000660816100002

The material functions simultaneously as an electrocatalyst and support for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Two different H2IrCl6 proportions in the reaction mixture were tested to observe the effect of this proportion on the electrocatalytic activity and composition of the materials. Physicochemical properties of Ir-Sn-S-O were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical properties of the materials studied were measured using cyclic voltammetry, linear scan voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Mechanical mixtures of IrO2 with Vulcan carbon or antimony doped tin oxide were also tested with respect to the OER to compare the properties of Ir-Sn-Sb-O. The results indicate that the catalyst-support materials presented nanometric sizes (1-2 nm) and electrocatalytic properties similar to IrO2 supported on Vulcan carbon but with higher stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction.

However, the development of flexible ZABs with great energy density, high round-trip efficiency, and long cycle life for practical applications is highly restricted by the lack of highly active oxygen catalysts, high ion-conducting solid-state electrolytes, appropriate Zn anodes, and advanced battery configuration. Promising oxygen catalysts should possess both, superior oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction performance and can be directly used as self-supporting cathodes without loading catalysts on support materials such as carbon cloth. In addition, electrolytes play an important role in ZABs; a good electrolyte should be in all-solid state with high ion conductivity. Moreover, for an excellent Zn anode, it is required to stably contact the electrolyte interface during the bending process. Therefore, in this review, recent advances in ZABs are summarized, including: i) the powder and 3D self-supporting oxygen catalysts, ii) the species of solid-state electrolytes, and iii) the rational design of Zn anodes. Finally, the challenges and opportunities of this promising field are presented.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2366-9608			WOS:000720254900001	35041275

Herein, we have developed a Palladium and Cobalt based (PdCo) nanocomposite that serves as a dual active electrocatalyst for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (0.5 M H2SO4, 1 M KOH) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (1 M KOH). The present nanocomposite is synthesised via reduction of reverse mixed metallomicellar core formed using palladium and cobalt metallosurfactants. The main approach of this methodology is to control the size of nanoparticle within the core of the metallomicelle with smaller and limited range of particle size distribution. This approach is cost effective and has reduced reaction time. The present electrocatalyst require 78 mV, and 310 mV of overpotential to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) of current density for HER (acidic) and OER (basic), respectively. This study provides a new methodology for the development of a new generation electrocatalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000672658700001

The properties of these materials evolve dynamically and heterogeneously(4) with applied voltage through ion insertion redox reactions, converting materials that are inactive under open circuit conditions into active electrocatalysts during operation(5). The catalytic state is thus inherently far from equilibrium, which complicates its direct observation. Here, using a suite of correlative operando scanning probe and X-ray microscopy techniques, we establish a link between the oxygen evolution activity and the local operational chemical, physical and electronic nanoscale structure of single-crystalline beta-Co(OH)(2) platelet particles. At pre-catalytic voltages, the particles swell to form an alpha-CoO(2)H(1.5 center dot)0.5H(2)O-like structure-produced through hydroxide intercalation-in which the oxidation state of cobalt is +2.5. Upon increasing the voltage to drive oxygen evolution, interlayer water and protons de-intercalate to form contracted beta-CoOOH particles that contain Co3+ species. Although these transformations manifest heterogeneously through the bulk of the particles, the electrochemical current is primarily restricted to their edge facets. The observed Tafel behaviour is correlated with the local concentration of Co3+ at these reactive edge sites, demonstrating the link between bulk ion-insertion and surface catalytic activity.Mapping the operational chemical, physical and electronic structure of an oxygen evolution electrocatalyst at the nanoscale links the properties of the material with the observed oxygen evolution activity.									121	5	0	0	11	0	121			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000647642900013	33953412

However, there remains the question as to whether the pristine material is truly bifunctional with regards to inherent activity for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution (OER), which has implications for their use in commercial electrolyzers when coupled with renewable energy sources. Herein, we present a case study on electrochemically synthesized NiSx, NiPx and NiSex films by using a cyclic voltammetric deposition technique. The HER and OER performances of these electrocatalysts were evaluated in 1M NaOH, where good activity was observed. Post-OER catalysis analysis with scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that structural changes are limited to the surface of the materials, but that extensive oxidation occurs. Subsequent HER experiments revealed a significant deterioration in performance in all cases. This raises the question if materials of this type in their pristine state can truly be regarded as bifunctional for overall electrochemical water splitting?									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			2196-0216			WOS:000476572700003

Cyclic voltammetry studies indicated the formation of a surface redox couple during potential cycling conditions before the onset of oxygen evolution. Under anodic conditions the steel surface behaved like a p-type semiconductor. The oxygen evolution reaction followed second-order kinetics in OH- ion concentration. The Tafel slope values were close to RT/2F, irrespective of the nature of the electrode. AISI 302 stainless steel has been found to be more electrocatalytically active compared with other steels. On the basis of these results a common mechanism involving the formation of a metal oxide species in a slow chemical step has been suggested for oxygen evolution.									22	0	0	0	1	0	23			0022-0728			WOS:A1991HJ07400020

A NiCu/Al2O3/NCN composite electrode was prepared by electrodepositing NiCu particles onto the surface of the conductive alumina/NCN composite. Morphology, composition, crystalline structure and electrochemical properties of the NiCu/Al2O3/NCN composite electrode were investigated. The results showed that NiCu particles can be deposited onto the surface of the alumina/NCN composite by a coelectrodeposition method. NiCu particles in the form of solid solution with face-centered cubic (fcc). structure were relatively uniformly distributed over the carbon layer of the conductive ceramic between alumina grains.

Perovskite materials have been particularly proposed as good and economically reasonable electrocatalysts for the OER, showing promise and advantages with respect to classic metallic electrodes. However, the degradation of perovskites during catalysis limits their service lifetime. Recently, the material BaCo0.98Ti0.02O3-delta:Co3O4 was shown to be electrocatalytically and chemically stable during water electrolysis even under industrially relevant conditions. The lifetime of this perovskite-based system is prolonged by a factor of 10 in comparison to that of Pr0.2Ba0.8CoO3-delta and is comparable to that of industrially applied electrodes. Here we report on the degradation kinetics of several studied by monitoring the oxygen evolution at microelectrodes.

Herein, we report a self-supported bead string-like nitrogen-doped CoO@CoP (N-CoO@CoP) arrays derived from MOF materials, serving as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting. The unique 3D bead string-like arrays endow unimpeded electronic transport path, abundant bubble release channels and expose more active sites, which can easily achieve high current density in the electrocatalytic reaction process. The doped atom N coming from nitrogen-contained MOF can tune the electronic structure of CoP, which enhances the electrocatalytic performance further.

J	Zhao, Hong; Yao, Huixue; Wang, Shuting; Cao, Yali; Lu, Zhenjiang; Xie, Jing; Hu, Jindou; Hao, Aize								Doping-engineered bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst with Se/Fe-doped Co3O4/N-doped carbon nanosheets as highly efficient rechargeable zinc-air batteries.								Journal of colloid and interface science				626				475	485		10.1016/j.jcis.2022.06.147				2022-Nov-15	2022	Highly efficient oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions have the critical role in the practical application of zinc-air batteries. Herein, doping engineering strategy has been adopted by construction of Se/Fe-doped in Co3O4/N-doped carbon nanosheets (denoted as Se/Fe-Co3O4/N-CNs) catalyst for boosting oxygen electrocatalytic activity. The achieved Se/Fe-Co3O4/N-CNs catalyst presents high-performances electrocatalytic characteristics, which exhibits a small overpotential gap (0.79V), excellent oxygen evolution reaction activity with a small overpotential of 361mV and a low Tafel slope of 57.3mV dec-1 at 10mAcm-2 as well as excellent oxygen reduction reaction activity with a large half-wave potential of 0.8V, also surpassing the majority of reported Co3O4-based electrocatalysts. The outstanding catalytic performances are benefiting from the contributions between Se/Fe doping engineering and N-doped carbon nanosheets optimizing the electronic structure of Co species, endowing more active sites, enhancing the intrinsic catalytic activity and accelerating charge transfer rate for oxygen electrocatalytic process. Particularly, the as-fabricated zinc-air batteries with Se/Fe-Co3O4/N-CNs as air cathode presents a high open circuit potential of 1.41V, a prominent highly efficient peak power density of 141.3 mW cm-2, a high specific capacity of 765.6 mAh g-1 and energy density 861.3 Wh kg-1 at current density of 10mAcm-2 as well as an excellent cycling stability, which are exceeding the commercial Pt/C-RuO2 based zinc-air batteries. This work lays a foundation for design and development of high-performance bifunctional cobalt-based electrocatalysts for rechargeable metal-air batteries application.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				1095-7103		MEDLINE:35803146	35803146

It depends on the bombardment of the highly reactive energetic species (including O, OH center dot, O-2(+), and e) with the NF to form the oxide layer in an ultrafast way. The specific feature of the plasma technology gives rise to the simultaneous formation of mixed Ni3+/Ni2+ ions and rich oxygen defects in the APPJ-NixOy/NFs. Specifically, for the APPJ-NixOy/NFs formed in a short time of 5 min, they show remarkably high catalytic activities and excellent stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). They only need an onset potential of 1.490 V and an overpotential of 355 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). They also exhibit faster reaction kinetics and a lower Tafel slope (88 mV dec(-1)). The presence of mixed Ni3+/Ni2+ ions and rich oxygen defects plays an important role in the high catalytic activities of the APPJ-NixOy/NFs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the heterojunction between the NixOy layer and the NF greatly reduces the UL(OER) value, which also contributes to the high catalytic activities of the APPJ-NixOy/NFs. The work reported here provides a potential approach to fabricating transition metal oxide layers with enhanced catalytic activities for overall water splitting.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2574-0962			WOS:000656119600082

Ruthenium was chemically deposited on nickel powder particles prior to polymerization of Ni/Ru powder with lanthanum phosphate. X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), BET, differential thermal analysis (DTA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), EDX and u.v./vis. spectrophotometry were used to investigate the composition, morphology and characteristics of the electrodes. The influence of the ruthenium content and polymerization temperature on the electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen and oxygen evolution were studied.

Herein, we constructed monodispersed IrNix nanoparticles (NPs) with distinct composition-segregated features and captured their structural evolution in various OER environments. We decoded the interesting self-reconstruction of IrNix NPs during the OER, in which an Ir-skin framework is generated in an acidic electrolyte, while a Ni-rich surface layer is observed in an alkaline electrolyte owing to Ni migration. Benefiting from such self-reconstruction, considerable OER enhancements are achieved under both acidic and alkaline conditions. For comparison, IrNix nanoframes with Ir skins prepared by chemical etching show a similar structural evolution result in the acidic electrolyte, but a total different phenomenon in the alkaline electrolyte. By tracking the structural evolution of IrNix catalysts and correlating them with OER activity trajectories, the present work provides a significant understanding for designing efficient OER catalysts with controlled compositional distributions.									60	0	0	0	2	0	60			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000440505000104	29924585

In this work, we demonstrated that the piezoelectric effect can also be employed in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) using non-centrosymmetric structured MoS(2)nanosheets loaded with Au nanoparticles. Piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM) measurement reveals a piezoelectric response of the Au-MoS(2)nanosheets. The prepared Au nanoparticle-loaded MoS(2)nanosheet catalyst shows an enhanced OER performance under ultrasonic vibration, which is ascribed to the piezo-enhanced electrocatalytic effect. In addition, the proposed catalyst exhibits a piezo-catalytic effect in dye decomposition reactions.

However, carbon oxidation at high potentials is definitively an issue for carbon-containing anodic electrode materials in water electrolyzers. We have recently demonstrated that after processing BSCF with carbon, the electronic structure of the material changes and high OER activity can be achieved. In this contribution we show that after processing BSCF with carbon it is possible to remove the carbon component retaining the same high OER activity of the BSCF/carbon composite electrodes, improving at the same time the electrode stability, i.e. avoiding the carbon oxidation at high potentials.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1938-5862			INSPEC:15991708

Here, a novel approach for the synthesis of a trifunctional electrocatalyst derived from iron/cobalt-containing polypyrrole (PPy) hydrogel is reported. This strategy relies on the formation of a supramolecularly crosslinked PPy hydrogel that allows for efficient and homogeneous incorporation of highly active Fe/Co-N-C species. Meanwhile, Co nanoparticles are also formed and embedded into the carbon scaffold during the pyrolysis process, further promoting electrochemical activities. The resultant electrocatalyst exhibits prominent catalytic activities for ORR, OER, and HER, surpassing previously reported trifunctional electrocatalysts. Finally, it is demonstrated that the as-obtained trifunctional electrocatalyst can be used for electrocatalytic overall water splitting in a self-powered manner under ambient conditions. This work offers new prospects in developing highly active, nonprecious-metal-based electrocatalysts in electrochemical energy devices.									254	21	0	0	16	0	257			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000400449200006

Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the fuel cell cathode has required Pt as the electrocatalyst for high activity and selectivity of the four-electron reaction pathway. Targeting a less expensive, earth abundant alternative, we have developed the synthesis of cobalt phosphide (Co2P) nanorods for ORR. Characterization techniques that include total X-ray scattering and extended X-ray absorption fine structure revealed a deviation of the nanorods from bulk crystal structure with a contraction along the b orthorhombic lattice parameter. The carbon supported nanorods have comparable activity but are remarkably more stable than conventional Pt catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline environments.									110	4	0	0	4	0	110			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000360323300039	26171574

However, the large overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a bottleneck in water splitting. Exploiting value-added alternative reactions to replace the OER semi-reaction in water splitting can not only produce valuable products at both electrodes, but also reduce the overpotential of water splitting. Recently, metal chalcogenides (sulfides and selenides) have been widely studied in electrocatalytic reactions. This review concentrates on the recent application of metal chalcogenides in value-added anodic reactions by replacing the OER during electrochemical water splitting, including urea oxidation reaction (UOR), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural electrochemical oxidation reaction (HMF-EOR), which provides the guidance for the rational design of advanced metal chalcogenide electrocatalysts in renewable energy.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2451-9103			WOS:000819856600025

Herein, the core-shell structured Co3Fe7@Fe2N nanoparticles supported on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets (Co3Fe7@Fe2N/rGO) is designed though the simple annealing of MOFs. The as-fabricated samples present an excellent electrocatalytic performance for ORR and OER due to the synergistic effect of electrode materials. The Co3Fe7@Fe2N/rGO exhibits an onset potential of 0.98 V (vs. Reversible hydrogen electrode), peak current intensity of 1.531 A g(-1) and long-term stability for ORR, which is close to that of the benchmark Pt/C (20%) in 0.1 M KOH. It also shows good oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with an overpotential of 371 mV (at 10 mA cm(-2)). When used as a bifunctional air electrode in Zn-air batteries, the core-shell materials enabled an excellent mass power density of 60 W cm(-2) g(-1) at 0.57 V and stable cycling performance for over 100 cycles.

A NiFe LDH with distinct lattice contraction and microcrystallization was synthesized via a simple one-step method using sodium gluconate. The lattice contraction is attributed to the interaction of carbon in sodium gluconate and iron in NiFe LDH. The NiFe LDH with optimized microcrystallization and lattice contraction shows a low overpotential of 217 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent durability of 20 h at a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2). The results revealed that a contractive metal-oxygen bond could boost the intrinsic activity of active sites and the microcrystallization promotes an increase in the number of active sites in terms of unit area. The chemical environment of oxygen elemental characterization and resistance at different chronopotentiometry times confirm that the lattice oxygen element is indeed involved in the process of OER, supporting the lattice-oxygen-mediated mechanism of NiFe LDH. Density functional theory calculations reveal that contractive metal-oxygen bonds induced a reduction of the adsorption energy barrier of intermediate products, thus improving the intrinsic catalytic activity. The special characteristics of microcrystallization and lattice contraction of NiFe LDH provide a strategy to improve both the number and the intrinsic activity of active sites in a versatile manner.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2637-9368		WOS:000810055800001

Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst for water splitting behavior of SWCNT-CoumPc hybrid nanomaterial were evaluated. The SWCNT-Coum-Pc hybrid reduced the onset potential required for HER by approximately 200 mV compared to SWCNT catalyst in acidic medium. The SWCNT-Coum-Pc catalyst reduced the HER overpotential of 570 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 in alkaline medium. It also exhibited outstanding activity in OER, required only an overpotential of 330 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2. Heterogeneous rate constants of the electrodes from impedance analysis were used to calculate the value of charge transfer resistance and the conductivity of the composite film. The presence of Coum-Pc groups on the SWCNT surface increased for both the conductivity and electron transfer rate of the SWCNT. Therefore, SWCNT-Coum-Pc hybrid significantly improved the performance of OER and HER for water splitting. The present work provided a promising ground for the of SWCNT-Coum-Pc hybrid as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000693029200017

Herein, an ultrafast strategy is reported to synthesis homogeneous Cu2O octahedrons inlaid in Ni foam (oct_Cu2O-NF) via spontaneous replacement of Ni with Cu, followed by rapid oxidization of Cu in air. Benefiting from the high dispersion of uniform octahedral structure and strong interaction between Cu2O and Ni foam, oct_Cu2O-NF displayed a superior activity for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as well as outstanding stability. After assembling oct_Cu2O-NF as bifunctional electrodes for alkaline seawater splitting, the electrolyzer exhibited a very small cell voltage of 1.71 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2). This brand-new way of ultrafast synthesis for oct_Cu2O-NF experimentally confirms the feasibility of Cu-based nanomaterials for efficient water/seawater electrolysis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000819470500002

Herein, we first report a novel strategy to develop WO3 center dot nH(2)O (n = 0.33, 1.00, or 2.00) as a highly active and durable bifunctional catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media by controlling the degree of hydration. The content of solvated water molecules in WO3 center dot nH(2)O can be precisely controlled by selectively using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or DL-malic acid for room-temperature precipitation synthesis. Structural flexibility associated with water solvation in WO3 center dot nH(2)O leads to excellent bifunctional catalytic activity as well as durability in acidic media. The bifunctional catalytic mechanism of WO3 center dot nH(2)O is mainly attributed to spontaneous partial dehydration during electrolysis, resulting in simultaneous formation of active phases for HER and ORR, respectively.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2168-0485			WOS:000545975600029

When used as an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, the Mo2CTx NMs thus derived exhibit outstanding catalytic activity with an overpotential of 180 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This enables Mo2CTx NMs to become one of the best OER electrocatalysts ever reported, with the desired stability in alkaline environment which is a major challenge for most of the non-oxide/hydroxide based electrocatalyts. Additionally, the Mo2CTx MFs can catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and act as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting which can attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.7 V. Mo LIII-edge X-ray near-edge absorption studies combined with theoretical calculations imply that surface-terminated oxygen is crucial in activating the outstanding OER performance, whereas the top Mo atomic sites on the surface contribute to excellent HER performance.									97	6	0	0	6	0	97			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000453616800069

In addition to the microstructure evolution, the simulations allow computing differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves from the overall enthalpy change as a good representation for the reaction kinetics. The reaction kinetics are investigated with a focus on the interplay between the phase formation and oxygen exchange between the brazing filler and the ambient atmosphere. For the oxygen exchange, a simple permeability model is introduced, which is based on the interface mobility of the gas-melt phase boundary and which describes the oxygen flux j proportional to the equilibrium partial pressure difference Delta p. It is observed that the L1 liquid phase can serve as a "buffer," providing or absorbing oxygen for phase transformation reactions. This "buffering" changes the oxygen activity, which in turn affects reaction temperatures and thus allows controlling reaction temperatures by adjusting the oxygen partial pressure in the ambient atmosphere: Higher oxygen levels increase the temperature of CuO formation, which requires oxygen, and lower the transformation temperatures for fcc-Ag solidification, which itself releases oxygen possibly leading to gas pore formation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1438-1656	1527-2648		WOS:000346487900011

Reinsberg, Philip H./0000-0003-4253-5436			Oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution in DMSO based electrolytes: the role of the electrocatalyst								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				17	38			25593	25606		10.1039/c5cp04356e				2015	2015	In the present paper the role of the electrode material in oxygen reduction in DMSO based electrolytes is elucidated using DEMS. We have found, employing platinum, gold, ruthenium rhodium, selenium decorated rhodium and boron doped diamond (BDD) as electrode materials, that the actual mechanism of oxygen reduction largely depends on the electrode material. At platinum, rhodium and selenium decorated rhodium the final reduction product, peroxide, is formed electrochemically. At gold and at low overpotentials oxygen is reduced to superoxide and peroxide is only formed by disproportionation of the latter. No oxygen reduction takes place at the diamond surface of the BDD-electrode, hence, showing unambiguously that oxygen reduction is an inner sphere reaction. Also, the rate of oxygen evolution varies with the electrode material, although the onset potential of oxygen evolution is not influenced. The amount of peroxide formed is limited to 1-2 monolayers. Contrary to intuition oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution from peroxide, therefore, are heterogeneous, electrocatalytic reactions. The finding of such an electrocatalytic effect is of great importance for the development and optimization of lithium-air batteries. Aside from the electrode material there are also effects of water as well as of the cation used in the electrolyte. This suggests an influence of the double layer at the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte on oxygen reduction in addition to the well-known higher stability of Na2O2 and K2O2. Electrospray ionization (ESI) results show that any effect of water in the Li+ containing electrolyte is not due to an altered solvation of the cation.									44	1	0	0	2	0	44			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000361697400109	26371703

The sluggish kinetics at anode and cathode, thus, require plenty of research work on the development of an efficient and stable electrocatalyst, which would provide the enhanced activity of water splitting reaction as well as stability for long-term operation. This review draws a detailed sketch of the progress in the pursuit of replacing noble metals with non-precious perovskite-based substitutes without compromising the key electrocatalyst characteristics.

Moreover, the article also provides an insight to the associated density functional theory that can provide profound understanding of mechanism, involved behind these reactions and, the need for computational studies to exploit the active area of catalysts. It is believed that this article will assist researchers to explore key area of research in the current generation perovskites that show enhanced catalytic performance as well as to work on unforeseen challenges.									24	1	0	0	3	0	24			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000546550500001

In addition, the performance of the oxygen electrode strongly depends on the activity and architecture of materials employed. Perovskite oxide nanostructures of nickel-doped lanthanum cobaltite were prepared by a very simple and cost-effective solution combustion synthesis. The oxygen electrode containing a carbon-supported perovskite oxide catalyst with oxygen vacancies exhibited reduced polarization and improved discharge capacity compared with that containing only bare carbon without a catalyst. In particular, the LaNi0.25Co0.75O3-d catalyst showed the best catalytic activity for OER by achieving the oxidation of Li2O2 at 3.8 V. The widespread dispersion and mesoporous design of perovskite facilitates the diffusion of electrolyte and oxygen into the inner electrode to demonstrate cyclability for 49 cycles while maintaining a moderate specific capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1). Further, the synergistic effect of the fast kinetics of electron transport provided by the carbon support and the high electro-catalytic activity of the perovskite oxide resulted in excellent performance of the oxygen electrode for Li-O-2 batteries.

The catalytic role of the metal hydroxides formed by the decomposition of molecular catalysts toward oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) is a challenge in water-splitting systems. Recently, [Ni(TMC)(CH3CN)](NO3)(2) (TMC = 1,4,8,11-tetramethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane, complex 1), was reported to be the most efficient nickel-based complex at neutral pH. In this study, the role of the formed Ni hydroxide-like nanosized species in the presence of this complex under oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) is studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometry, and electrochemical method. A new method for detecting trace Ni hydroxide-like nanosized species on the surface of an electrode is also reported, which is promising for the detection of heterogeneous nickel-based catalysts on the surface of an electrode. The experiments suggest that Ni hydroxide-like nanosized species formed during reaction is an alternative catalyst for OER. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, an effective active sites engineering strategy of bottom-up synthesized N, S co-doped graphene (NSG) nanosheets was developed via a facile pyrolysis of the mixed solid power of 2,6-diaminopyridine (DAP) as N source and ammonium persulfate (AP) as S source. All NSG nanosheets prepared with various mass ratio of DAP and AP possess high surface area up to more than 1000 m2 g-1 and highly degree of crystallinity, but display significant differentiation in electrocatalytic selectivity, in which, the NSG prepared by DAP and AP with the mass ratio of 1:1 displays the highest ORR performance with a half-wave potential of 0.87 V vs. RHE, while the NSG with the mass ratio of 3:1 and 1:3 exhibit the highest activity for OER and HER respectively, achieving the corresponding potential of 1.58 V vs. RHE and 0.118 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm-2, respectively. These activities are comparable and even better than their precious metal counterparts, outperforming the vast majority of reported doped carbon materials prepared using other strategies and precursors. The excellent eletrocatalytic activity and selectivity essentially originate from the optimized intermediates energy of three-reaction pathways via active sites engineering constructed by tuning the ratio of graphitic-N and thiophenic-S dopants in NSG nanosheets, obtained by controlling the ratio of precursors of DAP and AP. This tuning strategy of active sites provides an effective and convenient way to develop precisely function-orientated water-cycled electrocatalysts based on a certain platform of N-containing precursor.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000661105400034

Transition metal sulfides are earth abundant and widely studied for accelerating water splitting reactions. Cuprous sulfide, which is a common mineral and generally regarded as less active for oxygen evolution reaction, can also effectively promote water oxidation by introducing coarse surfaces on the asprepared Cu2S nanorod arrays, with a largely increased double layer capacitance and thereby a greatly improved electrochemically active surface area, which only needs an overpotential of 360 mV to deliver 50 mA cm(-2) and exhibits a rapid kinetics for oxygen evolution reaction. The fabrication strategy of creating coarse surfaces on pre-synthesized nanostructures for increased electrochemically active surface area can be promising for developing precious-metal-free electrocatalysts by providing more active sites and surface areas for water oxidation, and is also valuable for promoting the activity of less active but earth-abundant materials to achieve a better cost-effectiveness in scale-up application of water splitting technology.

The role of electrophilic functional groups (carbonyl, pyridinic, thiol, etc.) incorporated in graphene oxide has been studied towards the anodic corrosion resistance. Heteroatom functionalized carbon supports possess modified electronic properties, surface oxygen content, and hydrophilicity, which are crucial in governing electrochemical corrosion in the alkaline oxidative environment. Evidently, electron-withdrawing groups in NGO support (pyridinic, cyano, nitro, etc) and its lower oxygen content impart maximum corrosion resistance and anodic stability in comparison to the other sulfur-doped and codoped graphene oxide support. In this report, we establish the baseline evaluation of carbon-supported OER electrocatalysts by a systematic analysis of activity and substrate corrosion resistance. The result of this study establishes the role of surface composition of the doped supports while for designing a stable, corrosion-resistant OER electrocatalyst.

Surface alteration driven bi-functional catalytic activity of alkali niobate-N doped graphene composite for exalted oxygen electrochemistry								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				580						152160	10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.152160				APR 1 2022	2022	In this work, we establish that surface reconstruction, oxygen vacancies -specifically those located on the catalyst surface, and high crystallinity can be effective in tuning the catalytic activity of perovskite oxides. We report a high-performance electrocatalyst with an orthorhombic perovskite structure (NaNbO3), having an anisotropic surface layer and high crystallinity that exhibits superior activity and durability for the bi-functional oxygen electrochemistry compared to that of a similar perovskite composition with an isotropic surface layer and low crystallinity. The improvement in the electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is mainly attributed to the formation of an easy diffusion path on the surface layer due to the ionic movements, enhanced intrinsic activity of the catalytic sites resulting from the higher crystallinity, high oxygen vacancies and a large electrochemically active surface area. The sole key parameter in achieving all the acquired characteristics is the annealing temperature. We believe that the straightforward method of bringing the desired combination of properties by just tweaking the annealing temperature is handy and energy-efficient, and hence easily adoptable.									3	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000762840900005

However, the instability of sulfide ions during the water oxidation is a critical obstacle to simultaneous evolution of hydrogen and oxygen(3). Here, we demonstrate the activation and stabilization of Y2Ti2O5S2, with a bandgap of 1.9 eV, as a photocatalyst for overall water splitting. On loading of IrO2 and Rh/Cr2O3 as oxygen and hydrogen evolution co-catalysts, respectively, and fine-tuning of the reaction conditions, simultaneous production of stoichiometric amounts of hydrogen and oxygen was achieved on Y2Ti2O5S2 during a 20 h reaction. The discovery of the overall water splitting capabilities of Y2Ti2O5S2 extends the range of promising materials for solar hydrogen production.									234	14	0	0	21	0	235			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000476651600015	31209390

The overpotential for OER is one of the lowest that has been reported up to now, making this one of the best OER electrocatalysts. In addition, this molecular complex exhibits an exceptionally high mass activity (111.02 Ag-1) and a much higher TOF value (0.26 s(-1)) at a overpotential of 300 mV.

Herein, we present a facile concept for the synthesis of efficient high-entropy metal-organic frameworks (HEMOFs) as electrocatalysts in a one-step solvothermal synthesis. This strategy allows control of the microstructure and corresponding lattice distortion by tuning the metal ion composition. As a result, the OER activity was improved by optimizing the coordination environment of the metal catalytic center. The optimized Co-rich HEMOFs exhibited a low overpotential of 310 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), better than a RuO2 catalyst tested under the same conditions. The finding of lattice distortion of the HEMOFs provides a new strategy for developing high-performance electrocatalysts for energy conversion.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000753296800001	35041236

For HER, in an acidic solution the Mo2C-GNR has an onset potential of 39 mV and a Tafel slope of 65 mV dec(-1), and in a basic solution Mo2C-GNR has an onset potential of 53 mV, and Tafel slope of 54 mV dec(-1).

In this work, we report the morphology-controllable synthesis of zinc cobalt mixed sulfide (Zn-Co-S) nanoarchitectures, including nanosheets, nanoplates, and nanoneedles, grown on conductive carbon fiber paper (CFP) and the micronanostructure dependent electrochemical efficacy for catalyzing hydrogen and oxygen in zinc-air batteries and water electrolysis. The formation of different Zn-Co-S morphologies was attributed to the synergistic effect of decomposed urea products and the corrosion of NH4F. Among synthesized Zn-Co-S nanostructures, the nanoneedle arrays supported on CFP exhibit superior trifunctional activity for oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, and hydrogen evolution reactions than its nanosheet and nanoplate counterparts through half reaction testing. It also exhibited better catalytic durability than Pt/C and RuO2. Furthermore, the Zn-Co-S nanoneedle/ CFP electrode enables rechargeable Zn-air batteries with low overpotential (0.85 V), high efficiency (58.1%), and long cycling lifetimes (200 cycles) at 10 mA cm(-2) as well as considerable performance for water splitting. The superior performance is contributed to the integrated nanoneedle/CFP nanostructure, which not only provides enhanced electrochemical active area, but also facilitates ion and gas transfer between the catalyst surface and electrolyte, thus maintaining an effective solid-liquid-gas interface necessary for electrocatalysis. These results indicate that the Zn-Co-S nanoneedle/CFP system is a low cost, highly active, and durable electrode for highly efficient rechargeable zinc-air batteries and water electrolysis in alkaline solution.									116	6	0	0	5	0	119			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000399354100048	28319373

Being an inexhaustible resource of water on our planet, seawater can be a promising alternative electrolyte for industrial hydrogen production. However, many challenges are hindering the actual application of seawater splitting, especially the competing reactions relating to chlorine at the anode that could severely corrode the catalysts. The execution of direct seawater electrolysis needs efficient and robust electrocatalysts that can prevent the interference of competing reactions and resist different impurities. In recent years, researchers have made great advances in developing high-efficiency electrocatalysts with improved activity and stability. This review will provide the macroscopic understanding of direct seawater splitting, the strategies for rational electrocatalyst design, and the development prospects of hydrogen production via seawater splitting. The nonprecious metal-based electrocatalysts for stable seawater splitting and their catalytic mechanisms are emphasized to offer guidance for designing the efficient and robust electrocatalyst, so as to promote the production of green hydrogen via seawater splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-6412		WOS:000801737100001

This study uses a facile hydrothermal method for uniformly coating CeO2 shells on the surfaces of ZIF-67-derived porous Co3O4@Z67-NT (T-temperature, 500-900 degrees C) cores. Co3O4@Z67-N700@CeO2 exhibits excellent bifunctional (ORR/OER) catalytic activity with a Delta E [E-j=10(OER) - E-1/2(ORR)] of 0.70 V. For ORR, Co3O4@Z67-N700@CeO2 exhibits a higher half-wave potential of 0.88 V (vs. RHE) than that of commercial Pt/C (0.87 V), which is attributed to the synergies between CeO2 (Ce3+) and Co3O4 (Co2+). The oxygen vacancies on CeO2 can enhance O-2 adsorption on the interfaces to promote the activation of adsorbed O-2 to O-2(-), and can alleviate O-2 deficiency during ORR, thereby improving ORR activity. For OER, Co3O4@Z67-N700@CeO2 has a lower overpotential of 350 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a higher Faraday efficiency of 92.2% than those of RuO2. An effective valence transition between Ce3+ and Ce4+ endows CeO2 with high electrical conductivity and oxygen storage capacity, which greatly promote charge transfer and the generation/smooth transport of highly active species (O-2(2-)/O-). Moreover, the interactions between CeO2 (Ce3+/Ce4+ and oxygen vacancies) and Co3O4 (Co3+/CoOOH) provide more electrochemically active sites for OER. This study provides a new strategy for constructing the stable core@shell structure based on MOF derivatives to improve the ORR/OER performance.									101	7	0	0	6	0	101			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000509471800011

Considerable studies on different surfaces and polymorphs of iridium oxides (with varying stoichiometries and dopants) have emerged over the years, showing much higher OER activity than the conventionally reported rutile-type IrO2. Here, we have considered different metastable nanoporous and amorphous iridium oxides of different chemical stoichiometries. Using first-principles electronic structure calculations, we investigate the (electro)chemical stability, intercalation properties, and electronic structure of these iridium oxides. Using an empirical regression model between the Ir-O bond characteristics and the measured OER overpotentials, we demonstrate how activated Ir-O bonds (and the presence of more electrophilic oxygens) in these less understood polymorphs of iridium oxides can explain their superior OER performance observed in experiments.Here the authors use density-functional theory calculations to examine structure-property relations of nanoporous and amorphous iridium oxides and reconcile the superior oxygen evolution reaction catalytic performance reported in previous experiments.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2041-1723		WOS:000809119000014	35676247

Besides, the evolution of catalytic centers in MOFs and the related influence on their performance along the progress of reaction have rarely been studied. Here, we report a type of structurally stable bimetallic FeNi-MOF nanoarrays with self-optimized electrocatalytic activities in the oxygen production. Such a unique dynamic phenomenon is related with the gradual valence increments of Fe ions in MOFs, which trigger the continuous performance improvement before reaching an optimal steady state. Apart from the intact crystalline structures upon cycling, these FeNi-MOFs achieve low overpotentials of 239 and 308 mV at the current densities of 50 and 200 mA cm(-2), respectively, and show durable operation for over 1033 h (>43 days) at 100 mA cm(-2) and for another 200 h at 500 mA cm(-2). A direct comparison of isostructural and single crystalline Fe-MOFs and Ni-MOFs resolves higher activities of Fe sites in the bimetallic MOFs, which are corroborated by theoretical calculations. The Fe-O bond covalency increment during Fe oxidation enhances the proton-electron transfers with the oxygen 2p-band closer to the Fermi level, thereby expediting the OER process. This work provides deep insights into the understanding of catalytic processes in heterometallic MOFs.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			2155-5435			WOS:000664333800036

Clusters of nanosized crystallites are obtained by reducing surfactant-stabilized IrCl3 in water-free conditions. The catalyst shows a five-fold higher activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) than commercial Ir-black. The improved kinetics of the catalyst are reflected in the high performance of the PEM electrolyzer (1 mg(Ir)cm(-2)), showing an unparalleled low overpotential and negligible degradation. Our results demonstrate that this enhancement cannot be only attributed to increased surface area, but rather to the ligand effect and low coordinate sites resulting in a high turnover frequency (TOF). The catalyst developed herein sets a benchmark and a strategy for the development of ultra-low loading catalyst layers for PEM electrolysis.									138	5	0	0	5	0	139			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000368069200051	26616747

Herein, laser ablation in liquids (LAL), a green, mild and effective approach, has been, for the first time, employed to prepare CoOOH nanosheets with abundant oxygen vacancies and relatively thin thickness. Our theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that oxygen vacancies can optimize the absorption of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) intermediates and improve electrical conductivity; meanwhile, the relatively thin thickness can provide more active sites, thus leading to excellent OER activity of oxygen vacancy-modified CoOOH nanosheets.

A novel strategy is used to synthesize a non-noble-metal-based electrocatalyst of the OER by finely combining layered FeNi double hydroxide that is catalytically active and electric conducting graphene sheets, taking advantage of the electrostatic attraction between the two positively charged nanosheets. The synergy between the catalytic activity of the double hydroxide and the enhanced electron transport arising from the graphene resulted in superior electrocatalytic properties of the FeNi-GO hybrids for the OER with over-potentials as low as 0.21 V, which was further reduced to 0.195 V after the reduction treatment. Moreover, the turnover frequency at the overpotential of 0.3 V has reached 1 s(-1), which is much higher than those previously reported for non-noble-metal-based electrocatalysts.									603	44	0	0	32	0	616			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000339564800032	24910179

Herein, a universal metal organic framework (MOF)-mediated method for the synthesis of two-dimensional (2D) layered triple hydroxides (LTHs) nanosheets with ultrathin nature has been developed. It is interesting to disclose that the CoNi-based LTHs possess better electrochemical catalytic performance, giving superior performance to commercial RuO2 catalysts. Remarkably, benefitting from the ultrathin nanosheet configuration, optimized electronic structure, and strong synergistic effect, the optimized CoNiFe LTHs nanosheets show excellent OER performance with an ultralow overpotential of 262 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 88.1 mV dec(-1).

However, the insulating MoO3 species are inevitably generated during the oxygen incorporation process. Here, controlled plasma exposure time has been designed to explore the influence of MoO3 species on the HER performance for the O-2 plasma modified MoS2 catalysts. We find that the MoO3 species in MoS2 are not conductive to the HER electrocatalysis. More importantly, the Raman spectrum, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy disperse X-ray spectrum and transmission electron microscope analyses demonstrate that these co-generated MoO3 species are reduced and resolved from the MoS2 lattice during the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution, leading to a holey structure in the MoS2 nanosheets and thus a significant improvement of its hydrogen evolution stability. This work not only helps to understand the electrocatalytic influence of the co-generated MoO3 species in MoS2, but also presents a methodological improvement in designing defect-rich, oxygen incorporated and holey MoS2 nanosheets for highly efficient hydrogen evolution.

Titanium oxide-modified boron carbide (TiO2/B4C) was prepared by microwave treatment of the mixture of titanyl sulfate and B 4 C. TiO2/B-C/B4C was obtained after heating the TiO2/B4C at 700 degrees C in vacuum for 3 h. The TiO2/B-C/B4C exhibited a good ORR activity with an average electron transfer number of 3.9, which was close to that obtained with 20 wt% Pt electrocatalyst. The resultant TiO2/B-C/B4C electrocatalyst showed satisfying OER performance with an overpotential of 0.31 V at 10 mA cm(-2).

In the past decades, both theoretical and experimental progresses have been made in advancing the Pd-based nanocatalysts, leading to catalytic activity comparable to or even exceeding that of Pt. In the present review, we overview the recently important breakthroughs in the development of promising Pd-based nanoelectrocatalysts. We begin with the brief introduction of current knowledge in fundamental electrocatalytic behavior of Pd-based electrodes and some reaction mechanism, aiming to rationalize the general guidelines of structural design for more promising nanocatalysts. Then, we demonstrate the representative examples of high-performance Pd-based nanoelectrocatalysts in terms of catalytic reactions, including hydrogen evolution/oxidation reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, and liquid fuels oxidation reaction.

Experimental results indicate that the PA modification and Fe doping could effectively boost the charge transfer and mass transport during the OER process. Specially, PA2-Fe-MoS2 grown on NF (PA2-Fe-MoS2/NF) exhibits excellent OER activity (218 mV@20 mA cm(-2)) and durability, even superior to RuO2 and many other previously reported OER catalysts. This natural organic molecule modification provides a facile strategy to designing low-cost and efficient electrocatalytic materials.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000652758700001	33977662

This work demonstrates that PLAL is a powerful technology for generating amorphous CoNiPO4 with high-valence Ni3+, thus paving a new way towards highly effective OER catalysts.									14	2	0	0	1	0	15			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000514011800001	31840329

Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)											10.1002/anie.202213049				2022-Oct-11	2022	The exploration of earth-abundant and efficient electrocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for sustainable energy storage and conversion devices. In this work, we report a self-engaged strategy to fabricate a yolk-shelled OER electrocatalyst. Starting with a metal-organic framework, Co-Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH)@zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) yolk-shelled structures are formed in one step. Afterwards, these ZIF67 building blocks are transformed into Ni-Co LDH nanocages to form the Ni-Co-Fe hydr(oxy)oxide@Ni-Co LDH yolk-shelled microrods (NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMRs) through an ion-exchange reaction. Owing to the structural and compositional merits, the NiCoFe-HO@NiCo-LDH YSMR electrocatalyst exhibits an overpotential of 278 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm-2, a small Tafel slope of 49.7 mV dec-1, and good stability in alkaline media.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1521-3773		MEDLINE:36218244	36218244

The electrodes are prepared based on highly ordered TiO2 nanotubes grown from Ti foils with full geometric control. The tube walls are coated with iridium using atomic layer deposition (ALD), which allows for an accurate tuning of the amount deposited. The electrocatalytic performance of electrodes with different TiO2 tube lengths and iridium catalyst loadings toward OER is quantified by cyclic voltammetry and steady-state electrolysis. This study enables us to minimize the catalyst loading, and we reach a current density of 31.3 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential eta = 0.34 V for a tube length of L = 12 mu m and a Ir coating thickness of t = 6 nm. The benchmark of 10 mA cm(-2) is already achieved at a lower overpotential of eta = 0.24 V.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			2574-0962			WOS:000462944700086

In parallel, Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) is increasingly being used in (photo)electrocatalytic applications. In this contribution we report on the electrocatalytic activity towards OER of ALD-prepared cobalt phosphate thin films. The selected ALD approach enables tuning of the Co-to-P atomic ratio, which is found to significantly affect the activity of the prepared electrocatalyst. Specifically, concurrently with a Co-to-P ratio increase from 1.6 to 1.9, the current density for OER increases from 1.77 mA/cm(2) at 1.8 V vs. RHE (Reversible Hydrogen Electrode) to 2.89 mA/cm(2) at 1.8 V vs. RHE. Moreover the sample with a Co-to-P ratio of 1.9 has superior performance when compared to electrodeposited cobalt phosphate thin films reported in the literature.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000454898600016

Herein, FeCo(2)S(4 )nanosheet arrays loaded on Ni foam (NF) are synthesized and first employed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for full water-splitting. Remarkably, the self-assembled, binder-free, and cost-effective FeCo2S4/NF electrode shows high OER catalytic activity, which only requires an overpotential of 270 and 290 mV to achieve current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, the FeCo2S4/NF electrode exhibits considerable OER stability over 20 h at a static current density of 50 mA cm(-2), with negligible potential change in alkaline electrolyte. Meanwhile, when serving as a catalyst for the HER under alkaline conditions, an overpotential of just 132 mV is required to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The structural investigation demonstrates the formation of a Co(Fe)-(oxy)hydroxides layer on the catalyst surface during the OER test, which could be the real active species. Furthermore, because of the high catalytic activity and stability of this bifunctional electrocatalyst, we prepared a high-performance overall water electrolyzer that could achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.56 V.									61	4	0	0	4	0	61			2168-0485			WOS:000443924100069

This significant achievement, which is made possible by multicomponent heterostructure engineering, mainly arises from the ability to balance the adsorption and desorption of intermediates. Herein, the design of multicomponent heterostructures is highlighted by presenting recent achievements in electrocatalysis, focusing on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers have been demonstrated as the technology of choice for mass production of green hydrogen due to their scalability and potential high efficiency. However, the technology is still relatively expensive due to the catalyst materials cost and operational limitations due to mass transfer and activation polarizations. During the oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen bubbles stick to the electrode surface and this causes a low reaction rate and high mass transfer losses. In this study, the commonly used electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reactions; IrO2, is modified by intro-ducing magnetic Fe3O4 to achieve greater bubble separation at the anode during operation. The prepared composite catalysts were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscope, Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis, X-Ray Powder Diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spec-troscopy and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller characterization methods. The modified composite electrocatalyst samples are magnetized to investigate the magnetic field effect on oxygen evolution reaction performance in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. 90% IrO2-10% Fe3O4 and 80% IrO2-20% Fe3O4 samples are tested via linear sweep voltammetry both ex-situ and in-situ in a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer single cell. According to the linear sweep voltammetry tests, the magnetization of the 80% IrO2-20% Fe3O4 sample resulted in 15% increase in the maximum current density. Moreover, the single cell electrolyzer test showed a four-fold increase in current density by employing the magnetized 80% IrO2-20% Fe3O4 catalyst. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

However, it is still a great challenge to rationally design bimetallic catalysts because there is not a practical way to decouple the factors influencing the intrinsic activity of active sites from others, thus hindering in-depth understanding of the mechanism. Herein, we provide a rational design of bimetallic Ni, Co two-dimensional polymer model OER catalyst. The well-defined architecture, identical density of active sites and monolayer characteristic allow us to decouple the intrinsic activity of active sites from other factors. The results confirmed that the relative position and local coordination environment has significant effect on the synergistic effect of the bimetallic centres. The highest electrocatalytic activity with the turnover frequency value up to 26.19 s(-1) was achieved at the overpotential of 500 mV.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000868747800001	36106432

The 1D-Co3V2O8 electrocatalyst delivers 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of 0.350 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode for OER in 0.1 M KOH, whereas 0D-Co3V2O8 catalyst showed 0397 V, benefited from the morphological characteristics of 1D. Moreover, the 1D-Co3V2O8 catalyst exhibits much lower OER overpotential than that of commercial noble metal oxide catalysts, RuO2 (0.41 V) and Pt/C (0.79 V). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

With further structural modifications, BP-based heterostructured composites have exhibited attractive physical and chemical properties regarding to enhanced conductivity, ion transport, and catalysis activity, endowing them as potential candidates for electrochemical ions storage and electro/chemical catalysis. In this perspective, a brief summary is first given on the recent progress of BP and BP-derived materials in electrocatalysis, such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and nitrogen reduction reaction (N RR), and in rechargeable batteries, such as lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs), followed by a critical review on the current opportunities and challenges. It is expected that this class of emerging materials will bring about new potential solutions to address the current energy crisis and inspire researchers to develop more novel materials toward future multifunctional applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2366-7486			WOS:000863025300001

The as-prepared ZnCo2O4 sample presented good electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction performance with a small overpotential (eta(10) = 389 mV) and high stability in basic electrolyte. Furthermore, in basic medium, the as-synthesized ZnCo2O4 micro-rice also showed good electrocatalytic activity for glucose oxidation. A ZnCo2O4 micro-rice modified glass carbon electrode may be used as a potential non-enzymatic glucose sensor. The excellent electrocatalytic OER and glucose oxidation performances of ZnCo2O4 might be attributed to the unique porous structure formed by the nanoparticles. The porous architecture of the micro-rice can provide a large number of electrocatalytically active sites and high electrochemical surface area (ECSA). The result may offer a new way to prepare low-cost and high performance oxygen evolution reaction and glucose oxidation electrocatalysts.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18				2046-2069		WOS:000519540800053	35496530

Herein, a dandelion-like hierarchical NiMoP2-Ni2P (nanowire/nanoparticle) heterostructure was synthesized for efficient electrochemical water splitting. The NiMoP2-Ni2P heterostructures grown on carbon cloth as a freestanding integrated electrode exhibited excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities with low overpotentials (258 mV and 53 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER and HER, respectively), and small Tafel slope (45 mV dec(-1) and 58 mV dec(-1) for the OER and HER, respectively). Moreover, the NiMoP2-Ni2P heterostructure can act as both anode and cathode catalysts for overall water splitting with low overall potential of 1.48 V at 10 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory (DFT) combined with structural probes suggests that the amorphous heterogeneous interfaces play an essential role in enhanced catalytic performance.

This catalyst exhibits one of the highest turnover frequencies among metal oxides. Electrochemical, microscopic, and spectroscopic data, including those from operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy, reveal a dimeric Co-Fe moiety as the active site of the catalyst.

Among the materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are the most potential hotspot for developing state-of-the-art materials for efficient oxygen evolution and energy storage application because of their fascinating chemical and structural traits.

Dendritic Cu possessing dense coherent nanotwin (NT) boundaries (NTCu-5nm) is successfully prepared with an organic-assisted electrodeposition at high pulse current densities. NT boundaries significantly improve electrocatalytic efficiencies and stability of NTCu-5nm over nanocrystalline Cu (NCCu), reducing overpotentials at 10 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) from 378 to 281 mV and from 235 to 88 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with a small chronoamperometric decay of 5% after 100 h continuous overall water splitting at an ultrahigh initial current density of 500 mA cm(-2), largely outperforming the large chronoamperometric decay of 27% for only 1 h operation of the NCCu//NCCu couple. The defective twin boundaries enable formation of active (CuO2-)-O-III at low overpotentials, thus enhancing OER performance.

In this paper, we calculate the oxygen evolution reaction free energies and the surface adsorption distribution using a combination of density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations to "cover the waterfront," or cover a wide range of properties with a simulation of the hematite surface under working conditions. First, we show that modeling noninteracting catalytic sites provides a poor explanation of hematite's slow reaction kinetics. The interactions between the catalytic site may hinder catalysis through the strong interactions of *OH2 and *OOH intermediates, which cause the reaction to revert back to the *O intermediate. Hence, neighboring interactions may be a possible reason for the abundant, experimentally observed *O intermediate on the surface. This study demonstrates how neighboring sites impact the energy required for catalytic steps, thus providing new avenues to improve catalysis by controlling neighboring site interactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000755136900001	35044706

Herein, we prepare a novel glass-ceramic (Ni1.5Sn@triMPO(4)) by embedding crystalline Ni1.5Sn nanoparticles into amorphous trimetallic phosphate (triMPO(4)) matrix. This unique crystalline-amorphous nanostructure synergistically accelerates the surface reconstruction to active Ni(Fe)OOH, due to the low vacancy formation energy of Sn in glass-ceramic and high adsorption energy of PO43- at the V-O sites. Compared to the control samples, this dual-phase glass-ceramic exhibits a remarkably lowered overpotential and boosted OER kinetics after surface reconstruction, rivaling most of state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. The residual PO43- and intrinsic V-O sites induce redistribution of electron states, thus optimizing the adsorption of OH* and OOH* intermediates on metal oxyhydroxides and promoting the OER activity.									80	5	0	0	7	0	82			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000598639400001	33174369

However, iridium dissolution and surface reconstruction were observed, questioning the real active sites on the surface of these catalysts. In this work, (Sr2MIrO6)-O-(V) (M = Fe, Co) and (Sr2Fe0.5Ir0.5O4)-O-(V) were explored as OER catalysts in acidic media. Their activities were observed to be roughly equal to those previously reported for La2LiIrO6 or Ba2PrIrO6. Coupling electrochemical measurements with iridium dissolution studies under chemical or electrochemical conditions, we show that the deposition of an IrOx layer on the surface of these perovskites is responsible for their OER activity. Furthermore, we experimentally reconstruct the iridium Pourbaix diagram, which will help guide future research in controlling the dissolution/precipitation equilibrium of iridium species for the design of better Ir-based OER catalysts.									94	5	0	0	7	0	95			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000462622700019	30672081

In this study, we took the strategy, introducing Pt atoms into the structure of crystalline RuO2 to enhance the catalytic property toward OER while maintaining durability. The OER activity of Ru0.9Pt0.1O2/C with high stability was significantly higher than that of RuO2/C. In situ/operando ICP-MS analysis showed that Ru dissolution of Ru0.9Pt0.1O2/C during OER was suppressed by introducing Pt and thermal treatment when compared to Ru/C. The XPS results after OER measurement indicated that the Ru oxidation state of Ru0.9Pt0.1O2/C was higher than that of RuO2, which led to high OER catalytic activity. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the enhanced OER activity of Ru0.9Pt0.1O2/C was due to the change in the reaction mechanism from "adsorbate evolution" to "lattice participation". Our findings increase the possibility of significantly overcoming the activity and stability limits of Ru-based electrocatalysts for the OER using Pt.									33	1	0	0	1	0	33			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000480667900010

Herein, we describe the one-step hydrogen and oxygen evolution through a photocatalytic membrane reactor. Experimental tests were carried out by means of a two-compartment cell in which a modified Nafion membrane separated the oxygen and hydrogen evolution semi-cells, while iron ions permeating through the membrane acted as a redox mediator. Nanosized Au/TiO2 and Au/CeO2 were employed as suspended photocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen generation, respectively. The influence of initial Fe3+ ion concentration, ranging from 5 to 20 mM, was investigated, and the best results in terms of hydrogen and oxygen evolution were registered by working with 5 mM Fe3+. The positive effect of gold on the overall water splitting was confirmed by comparing the photocatalytic results obtained with the modified/unmodified titania and ceria. Au-loading played a key role for controlling the photocatalytic activity, and the optimal percentage for hydrogen and oxygen generation was 0.25 wt%. Under irradiation with visible light, hydrogen and oxygen were produced in stoichiometric amounts. The crucial role of the couple Fe3+/Fe2+ and of the membrane on the performance of the overall photocatalytic system was found.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2305-7084		WOS:000682906200005

The Co3O4-graphene hybrid catalysts with various Co3O4 contents are studied concerning the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1.0 M KOH, as well as, H2O2 sensing in 0.1 M NaOH. We find that increasing graphene content in the hybrid catalysts results in an overall improvement of the OER electrocatalytic activity due to the enhancement in the charge transfer kinetics. The hybrid catalyst with 25 wt% Co3O4 reveals the optimum electrocatalytic activity toward the OER with the lowest overpotential (eta) of 283 mV@ 10 mA cm(-2) and superior reaction kinetics with a low Tafel slope of 25 mV dec-1.

This article reviews the current theoretical methods for electrochemistry modeling, in particular, those for the direct computation of Tafel kinetics of electrocatalytic reactions on surfaces based on DFT calculations. Representative reactions, namely, hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions, are selected to illustrate how the theoretical methods are applied to compute quantitatively the kinetics of multiple-step electrochemical reactions.

Herein, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) supported flower-like Co3Ni1B nanosheets were successfully synthesized via a static precipitation method at room temperature and used as an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst. This two-dimensional (2D) catalyst has a high specific surface area, which exposes a large number of active sites.

Herein, a kind of layered potassium cobalt pyrophosphate dehydrate, i.e., K2Co3(P2O7)(2)center dot 2H(2)O, was prepared by a simple hydrothermal method, and was proved to be a novel OER electrocatalyst for the first time. The as-developed K2Co3(P2O7)(2)center dot 2H(2)O features a layered structure, large specific surface area, and special zigzag CoO6 octahedral chains, all of which contribute to the highly efficient OER performance. In specific, it achieves 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of only 296 mV and a Tafel slope of 40.2 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH.

The technique involved successful codeposition of iridium and palladium by a cyclic voltammetric method followed by a suitable heat treatment through which both iridium oxide and palladium oxide were formed. The electrodeposited iridium-palladium oxide shows different behaviour in acid and basic solutions in polarization and cyclic voltammetric measurements. The situation in acidic solution is more complicated. Tle large visible difference is mainly ascribed to palladium. High electrocatalytic activity and low overvoltage of the oxygen evolution reaction are the pronounced characteristics of iridium oxide. This iridium-palladium oxide film also has a high fraction of active sites for the oxygen evolution reaction, giving a Tafel slope of 0.48 in 1 N H2SO4. The results of the multicyclic voltammetric investigations indicated that the oxygen evolution reaction during electrolysis occurred beyond about 1 V and the iridium-palladium oxide is stable in the potential range below 2.3 V(SCE).

However, the incorporation of a third element into the crystalline framework increased the OER activity in an alkaline medium. Specifically, Co0.5Fe0.5WO4 prepared through a polyol route generated a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a considerably small overpotential (eta) and Tafel slope (331 mV and 36.8 mV dec(-1), respectively). This overpotential value was superior to those of Co0.5Fe0.5WO4 fabricated through a conventional hydrothermal route (eta at 10 mA cm(-2) = 360 mV) and commercial RuO2 (365 mV), a benchmark catalyst for the OER. The turnover frequency (TOF) of the polyol-synthesized Co0.5Fe0.5WO4 was estimated to be 0.235 s(-1) at an overpotential of 400 mV, while stable operation at 10 mA cm(-2) was maintained for at least 24 h.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000582677200009

It is of vital importance to regulate the surface electron state of pyrite to improve the electrocatalytic performance towards overall water splitting. In this work, we provide a simple one-pot interface-regulated strategy to synthesize Ni3S4/NiS2/FeS2 nanoparticles with exposed interfacial structures between Ni-S and Fe-S, which can then affect the conductivity and activity of pyrite. Notably, Ni3S4/NiS2/FeS2 nanoparticles are highly active in the hydrogen evolution reaction with 197 mV at 10 mA/cm(2). Superior oxygen evolution activity is observed for Ni3S4/NiS2/FeS2 nanoparticles with 1.46 V at 10 mA/cm(2), outperforming RuO2 with 1.54 V. Impressively, Ni3S4/NiS2/FeS(2 )nanoparticles could efficiently drive water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen at a voltage of 1.68 V at 10 mA/cm(2) in a two-electrode configuration and robust long-term stability was verified by continuous 20 h i-t tests without apparent loss in the current density. The outstanding catalytic activity could be traced back to the presence of interfacial structures between Ni-S and Fe-S.

B	Bediako, D.K.D.								The Electrocatalytic Evolution of Oxygen and Hydrogen by Cobalt and Nickel Compounds								The Electrocatalytic Evolution of Oxygen and Hydrogen by Cobalt and Nickel Compounds								292 pp	292 pp						2015	2015	In order to meet the ever-increasing demand for energy, a worldwide transition away from fossil fuels to renewable solar-fuels is required. However, the intermittency of local insolation mandates a cost-effective and efficient storage scheme. Using solar-derived electricity to drive the thermodynamically uphill water splitting reaction to generate dihydrogen and dioxygen is one promising method of storing solar energy in fuels. This "artificial photosynthesis" scheme requires the execution of two half-reactions, one involving the oxidation of water to O2-the oxygen evolution reaction (OER)-and the other entailing the reduction of hydrogen ions to H2-the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Accomplishing these electrocatalytic reactions stresses the development of catalysts that are capable of mediating reactions that are in net multi-electron, multi-proton transformations. Transition metal oxides are known to be promising candidates for mediating the OER and their electrocatalytic properties have been studied extensively and optimized for operation at pH extremes. In contrast, intermediate pH OER has been relatively underexplored and the influence of proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions on OER kinetics of these materials at close-to-neutral pH has for long remained unclear. The OER studies described here have focused on elucidating the underlying mechanistic basis for the catalytic behavior of a class of structurally disordered first-row transition metal oxides, with an emphasis on intermediate-pH catalysis and proton-electron coupling. At a fundamental level, understanding how protons and electrons may be managed and coupled to engender improved activity remains of great importance to the design of new electrocatalysts. To this end, the synthesis and study of homogeneous HER catalysts bearing functional groups in the second coordination sphere that can modulate proton-electron coupling is particularly interesting. The HER studies presented here discuss this important issue within the context of metalloporphyrin catalysts possessing proton relays.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-13-392-9174-1	INSPEC:16721460

Herein, the authors demonstrate a simple reconstruction strategy to fabricate electrodes maintaining a Fe-CoOOH phase and an intermediate-spin state during catalysis.Computational calculations and experimental studies reveal that the CoOOH phase and the intermediate-spin (IS) state are the key factors for realizing efficient Co-based electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, according to thermodynamics, general cobalt oxide converts to the CoO2 phase under OER condition, retarding the OER kinetics. Herein, we demonstrate a simple and scalable strategy to fabricate electrodes with maintaining Fe-CoOOH phase and an IS state under the OER. The changes of phase and spin states were uncovered by combining in-situ/operando X-ray based absorption spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Electrochemical reconstruction of chalcogenide treated Co foam affords a highly enlarged active surface that conferred excellent catalytic activity and stability in a large-scale water electrolyzer. Our findings are meaningful in that the calculated results were experimentally verified through the operando analyses. It also proposes a new strategy for electrode fabrication and confirms the importance of real active phases and spin states under a particular reaction condition.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17				2041-1723		WOS:000749535300014	35105874

In this paper, we demonstrated the construction of sheet-on-sheet heterostructures for photocatalytic pure water splitting, which could simultaneously supply oxygen for molecular oxygen activation. Benefitted from the efficient charge separation between interconnected TiO2 networks and faceted WO3 nanoplates, our 2-D heterostructured photo catalysts exhibited 30- and 6-fold increased activity for pure water splitting than pristine WO3 and TiO2, respectively. Under visible light irradiation, the oxygen generation rate of 178 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) was even comparable to the scavenger-facilitated oxygen evolution reactions reported in the literatures. The type II band alignment was favorable for the selective reduction of oxygen molecules, generating more reactive oxygen species for organic pollutant degradation. These findings represent a promising way of self-supplying oxygen from pure water splitting for environmental and biological application.									11	1	0	0	1	0	12			2168-0485			WOS:000503330400060

The catalytic efficiency of metalloporphyrin can be improved with deeper insight into its complex issues, such as structural stability and catalytic activity. Using in situ electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (EC-STM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the morphological evolution of the manganese porphyrin/Au(111) interface affected by the electrocatalytic reaction is revealed. In alkaline solution, the catalytic performance is dramatically enhanced after the first potential sweep, directly related to the formation of the MnOx-porphyrin complexes, driven by an irreversible oxidation-reduction process. These newly formed catalytically active materials exhibit synergistic effects with the Au interface.

The strong nickel-oxygen (Ni-O) covalency, tunable by A-site chemical substitution, contributes to both bulk and surface material properties like the formation of oxygen vacancies (v (center dot center dot) ( O )) and OER activity. Here we quantify the coverage of OER relevant adsorbates on a series of La1-x Sr (x) NiO3-delta (LSNO, 0 <= x <= 0.5) epitaxial thin films exposed to humid environments by ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. While all LSNO film compositions investigated here have comparable hydroxide coverages at the relative humidities (RHs) probed (1.5 x 10(-5) - 0.2%RH), the amount of under-coordinated surface oxygen increases notably with Sr content. We interpret differences in the free energy of adsorption (Delta G (ads,i )) of these OER intermediates, inferred from adsorption isotherms, in the context of proposed v (center dot center dot) ( O )-mediated OER mechanisms, consistent with the pH-dependent OER activity observed here for LSNO. We find that Sr incorporation enhances the affinity of LSNO surfaces for these under-coordinated oxygen species, in line with calculations in the literature.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000644693400001

Compared with the non-substituted POMs, transition metal substituted-POM would be a fatal factor to for improving the surface active sites of beta-FeOOH. The nanocomposite exhibits the excellent electrochemical activity with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 213 mV overpotential, a lowest Tafel slope of 47 mV dec(-1), and a excellent stability within 50 h in 1 M KOH. The Faraday efficiency is up to 97.6 %. The excellent electrocatalytic performance would be attributed to the multi-electronic structure of Co4POM and the structural advantage of pores in beta-FeOOH. Transition metal substituted-POM doped beta-FeOOH in this study could be an effective strategy for preparing nanocomposite as the high-performance electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-860X	1873-3875		WOS:000860740500002

We here demonstrate that the incorporation of S into RuCuO nanorings (NRs) can significantly enhance the acidic OER performance. Experimental investigations show that the incorporation of S can optimize the interaction of Ru and O, and therefore significantly suppresses the dissolution of Ru in acidic condition. The optimized catalyst (S-H-RuCuO NRs) displays superior OER performance to the commercial RuO2/C. Impressively, the S-H-RuCuO NRs can exhibit significantly enhanced stability for 3,000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry test and more than 250 h chronopotentiometry test at 10 mA.cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4.

Electrochemical water splitting is an efficient and promising technology for the production of high-purity hydrogen. However, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode of water electrolyzer limits the efficiency of water splitting due to the high overpotential. Therefore, the challenges still remain for the exploration of highly active, stable and low-cost catalysts with superior activity for OER. Herein, nickel borate nanorods with high crystallinity were prepared via high-temperature calcination. The as-obtained nickel borate nanorods with 2 mum in length and 200 nm in diameter exhibited excellent OER activity in terms of an overpotential of 373 mV at 10 mA·cm~(-2), even though their capacitance value was extremely low (0.03 mF·cm~(-2)), which could be further improved by coupling with other conductive materials or decreasing the size of nickel borate.			氢能被视为21世纪最具发展潜力的能源.电解水制氢具有诸多优点,如原料来源广泛、操作简便、产品纯度高、无污染,已成为最具有应用前景的方法之一,但其阳极氧析出反应动力学缓慢,严重制约电解水制氢的效率.因此,发展氧析出电催化剂尤为重要.本文利用高温煅烧法制备了硼酸镍纳米棒,长度约为2 mum,直径约为200 nm.与文献报道的低结晶度或无定型硼酸盐析氧催化剂不同,硼酸镍纳米棒的结晶度较高,并且具有较好的OER催化活性和稳定性.其催化活性可以通过与其他导电材料复合或进一步减小其尺寸等方式提升.						0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1006-3471			CSCD:6330616

In this work, we show the facile, scalable bottom-up synthesis of MSOCs using available low-cost metal salts, pyrene, and elemental sulfur as reactants. Upon condensation at high temperature, the monomers form a stable molten-state intermediate, directing the synthesis of MSOCs due to strong coordination between the metallic cation-sulfur-pyrene. These materials exhibit excellent activity towards OER achieving low overpotentials of 284 and 325 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2). The effect of the carbon support is demonstrated through high mass activity of the materials (similar to 300 A g(-1)) compared to the materials with no support.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000654744200001

Different surface treatments such as sandblasting and/or chemical pickling were employed. Fresh and aged electrodes were subjected to electrochemical measurements. The galvanostatic electrochemical ageing was performed for 21 days, applying an anodic current equal to 150 mA cm(-2). From the Tafel plots for the OER, two well-defined Tafel slopes were observed for all the electrodes, before and after the electrochemical ageing. This behaviour is due to the transformation of Ni(OH)(2) to beta-NiOOH, which is the "right type of oxide" for the oxygen evolution reaction. The kinetic parameters obtained on the electrodes with different surface finishing show that the sandblasted/pickled nickel substrate loses its electrocatalytic properties for the OER early on in the experiment.

However, the corresponding fabrication procedures for obtaining excellent energy-storage devices are relatively complicated and expensive. In this work, we report an innovative strategy on plasmon-activated water (PAW) serving as energy-storage medium from solar energy. The lifetime of the created energetic PAW solution from hot electron transfer (HET) on Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) illuminated with sunshine can last for 2 days, making the energy-storage system is practically available. Encouragingly, the energy-conversion efficiency from the solar energy in the PAW solution is ca. 6.7%. Compared to conventional deionized (DI) water solution, the prepared metastable PAW solution exhibited distinctly higher chemical potential at room temperature. It demonstrates abilities in faster evaporation and enhancing chemical reactions, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our proposed strategy on the simple and cheap energy-storage system based on prepared PAW utilizing solar energy is the first time shown in the literature.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2045-2322			WOS:000609202800029	33257784

Here, we use density functional theory calculations to investigate the OER and ORR catalytic activities of 3d single metal atoms coordinated by nitrogen atoms on carbon substrates. It is found that the adsorption energies of all reaction intermediates increase monotonically with the number of d electrons. By constructing the linear scaling relationships between the adsorption energies of reaction species, a volcano pattern is observed and the optimal conditions for high catalytic activity are obtained. Among the atom/substrate combinations, the Co atom on the pyridine-N-4 substrate exhibits the lowest theoretical overpotentials for both reactions. Furthermore, we propose that the trend in catalytic activity is mainly governed by the filling of the antibonding state between the metal atom and the reaction intermediate *O.									21	3	0	0	0	0	21			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000549942500030

The proposed hydrogen bubble-templated, diffusion-limited deposition process leads to the unprecedented dendritic growth of vertically aligned amorphous metal hydroxides, induced by the controlled electrolysis of the tuned water content in the primarily alcohol-based deposition solution. The hierarchical nature of these binder-free, amorphous metal hydroxide deposits leads to their superhydrophilic nature and underwater superaerophobic behavior. The combination of all of these qualities leads to exemplary catalytic performance. When directly grown on planar stainless steel substrates, these nanoforests show high OER activity with overpotentials as low as similar to 255 mV to produce a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) over 10 000 accelerated stability test cycles. This work demonstrates a novel fabrication technique that can simultaneously achieve a dendritic hierarchical structure, vertical alignment, superaerophobicity, amorphous crystal structure, and intimate contact with the substrate that leads to high catalytic activity with excellent durability.									54	3	0	0	2	0	55			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000409395500024	28758724

Compared to widely studied g-C3N4, C4N shows a smaller band gap of 1.99 eV, with a larger photocurrent response, and it can function as visible-light-harvesting antenna and bifunctional oxygen reduction/evolution (ORR/OER) catalysts, enabling effective photocoupling to tune oxygen catalysis. The C4N-enabled VLS-RZAB displays a low charge voltage of 1.35 V under visible light, which is below the theoretical RZAB voltage of 1.65 V, corresponding to a high energy efficiency of 97.78 %. Pairing a C4N cathode with a polymer anode also endows an VLS-RPAB with light-boosted charge performance. It is revealed that the ORR and OER active sites in C4N are separate carbon sites near pyrazine-nitrogen atoms and photogenerated energetic holes can activate OER for improved reaction kinetics.									18	1	0	0	3	0	18			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000668283200001	34014029

Herein, the porous core-shell MnCo2S4 microrugby balls are successfully synthesized via a two-step solvothermal method. Benefiting from the desired porous structure, strong electronic interaction and large specific surface area, it shows a small overpotential of 317 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 73.7 mV dec(-1) and robust stability, which is better than that of the corresponding metal oxides and commercial IrO2. The significantly enhanced OER performance of MnCo2S4 microrugby balls can be attributed to their high electrochemical active surface area and electrical conductivity.

The HEG consists of 5 different metals of Fe, Ni, Co, Cr, and Mn. The unique glycerate structure exhibits an excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with a low overpotential of 229 and 278 mV at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, in 1 m KOH electrolyte, outperforming its subsystems of binary-, ternary-, and quaternary-metal glycerates. The HEG also shows outstanding stability and durability in the alkaline electrolyte. The result demonstrates the significance of synergistic effect that gives additional freedoms to modify the electronic structure and coordination environment.

Here, we report the controlled electrodeposition of porous nickel iron hydrox-ylphosphate (NiFe-OH-PO4) nanobelts onto the surface of macroporous nickel foams (NF) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for efficient whole-cell water electrolysis. The NiFeOH-PO4/NF electrode shows both high water oxidation and water reduction catalytic activity in alkaline solutions and is able to deliver current densities of 20 and 800 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of merely 249 and 326 mV for oxygen-evolution reaction, current densities of 20 and 300 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of only 135 and 208 mV for hydrogen-evolution reaction. Further, in a two-electrode water electrolytic cell, the bifunctional NiFe-OH-PO4/NF electrodes can obtain the current densities of 20 and 100 mA cm(-2) at an overall cell potential of only 1.68 and 1.91 V, respectively. Remarkably, the NiFe-OH-PO4(/)NF catalyst also represents prolonged stability under both continuous and intermittent electrolysis and can be used for oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reversibly without degradation.									63	3	0	0	2	0	63			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000413503700034	28967253

Recently, iridium pyrochlores (A(2)Ir(2)O(7)) have attracted broad attention as promising catalysts due to their unique electronic properties and the less iridium content relative to IrO2, while in iridium pyrochlores, the relatively high concentration of oxygen vacancies decreases the Ir-O hybridization, hindering the OER process. The electronic states of iridium-based pyrochlore M2Ir2O7 (M = Lu, Pr) are rationally tuned through partial substitution in A-site of Zn2+ for Lu3+ or Pr3+, efficiently promoting its intrinsic activity. The optimal Pr1.8Zn0.2Ir2O7 and Lu1.8Zn0.2Ir2O7 electrocatalysts exhibit 114.6 and 135.32 A g(Ir)(-1) high mass activity at 1.58 V vs. RHE. Combining X-ray absorption spectrum with DFT calculations, we demonstrate that the doping of Zn2+ reduces the defective oxygen and regulates the electron distribution. The decrease of defective oxygen leads to the O-2p band center upshift, resulting in the Ir-O covalency promotion and the decrease of the binding energy between oxygen intermediates and Ir to accelerate the OER process. This work provides a fresh idea introducing small ionic radius Zn to solve the problem of high concentration of oxygen vacancies inevitably produced in the synthesis of pyrochlores.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000729816000007

In addition to the bifunctional electrocatalytic properties, CaSrFeMnO6-delta shows OER activity, which is even superior to the reported activities of precious-metal electrocatalysts, IrO2 and RuO2. The correlation of electrocatalysis with the charge-transport properties in the series Ca2FeMnO6-delta, CaSrFeMnO6-delta, and Sr2FeMnO6-delta is demonstrated.

Electrocatalysts with enriched vacancies are crucial for enhancing the catalytic activity of OER through defect engineering. We demonstrated the dealloying method in a reducing alkaline solution using the Co5Al95 alloy foil as a precursor to produce a new oxygen-vacancy-rich cobalt hydroxide (O-V-Co(OH)(2)) hierarchical dendrite. The as-synthesised O-V-Co(OH)(2) showed superior electrocatalytic activities toward OER when compared to pristine cobalt hydroxide (p-Co(OH)(2)), which had a low onset overpotential of only 242 mV and a small Tafel slope of 64.9 mV dec(-1). Additionally, for the high surface area provided by the hierarchical dendrite, both p-Co(OH)(2) and O-V-Co(OH)(2) showed a superior activity as compared to commercial catalysts. Furthermore, they retained good catalytic properties without remarkably decaying at an overpotential of 350 mV for 12 h.

Herein, an innovative metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) hybrid-assisted strategy is reported to synthesize core-shell CoIMn-ZIF@Fe-Co-Mn Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) toward highly efficient OER electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolyte. Physical characterization indicates that the amorphous hydroxide transformed from Co/Mn-ZIF@Fe-Co-Mn PBA (ZIF: zeolitic imidazolate frameworks) during the electrochemical process acted as the electroactive species. Benefiting from these structural and compositional features, the developed composite delivers a remarkably low overpotential of 270 mV with a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution.

Therefore, restless effort has been invested in the development of perovskite oxides as efficient OER catalysts, while the OER mechanism is still in veil. The rational development of perovskite catalysts for practical water electrolysis is left on hold until the full comprehension of the underlying mechanism is established under real operation conditions. Up to date, primarily two different OER mechanisms - conventional and lattice oxygen evolution - have been conjectured where the former follows a reversible route while the latter leads to irreversible changes. In this present study, we present evidence which suggests that perovskite catalysts follow both mechanisms concomitantly while one is preferentially selected based on their thermodynamic and kinetic natures dependent on pH.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14				2633-5409		WOS:000612088000018

Herein, amorphous NiFe(OH)(x) is successfully grown in situ on the surface of NiFe2O4 via an ultrasonic-assisted reduction method. This method takes advantage of ultrasonic cavitation to achieve a unique reduction effect, migration of Ni and Fe cations of NiFe2O4 to the crystal surface, and in situ growth of amorphous NiFe(OH)(x) thereby forming a NiFe2O4/NiFe(OH)(x) composite. This material exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance with an overpotential of 276 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The ultrasonic-assisted reduction method can be used to synthesize amorphous NiFe(OH)(x) with no residual reactants, providing a simple and facile way to synthesize amorphous hydroxide materials.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2168-0485			WOS:000595489200022

Herein, we report binder-free LaCoO3 perovskite nanosheets vertically grown on the nickel foam as an OER catalyst with enhanced performance and stability in alkaline electrolytes. The proposed catalyst displays an outstanding performance to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotential of 342 mV, while 390 mV is required for the bulk LaCoO3 prepared by conventional methods. The enhanced OER activity is mainly because the nanosheet structures have increased surface areas and enhanced conductivity and charge transfer. Moreover, the porous structure formed by vertically aligned nanosheets increases surface wettability, which enables the rapid dissipation of gas bubbles along with excellent durability. This work proposes an approach to unlocking the high intrinsic activity of perovskites for OER.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			2168-0485			WOS:000526592900018

The prepared electrodes were intensely analysed for both the energy conversion and energy storage systems. The acquired Co-P with the assorted morphology of scaffolds and spherical of Co2P/C electrode inspires with a significantly lower oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (271 mV eta 10) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (207 mV eta 10) overpotentials to accelerate progressive electrocatalytic activity. Additionally, the energy storage capacity was revealed with the Co2P electrode delivering an enriched specific capacity (322 C g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)) in conjunction with noteworthy rate capability (83%) and durable cycling stability (10000 cycles). Overall, an aqueous supercapattery device (Co2P/C parallel to AC) was fabricated providing superior energy density (35 Wh kg(-1)) and an improved power density (5333 W kg(-1)). The assembled water splitting system demanded a low cell voltage of 1.63 V to afford a high current density of 10 mA cm(-2).

Herein, P element serves as a bridging agent enabling strong electronic coupling between NPC and Co2P. While Co2P with good electrical conductivity facilitates electron transfer during electrocatalytic process. As a result, Co2P/NPC can catalyze oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in a direct 4e(-)pathway, reaching a half-wave potential of 0.835 V vs. RHE and a smaller Tafel slope of 45.9 mV dec(-1) than commercially available Pt/C. On the other hand, Co2P/NPC can also catalyze oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in a low overpotential of 320 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a smaller Tafel slope of 59.6 mV dec(-1) than commercially available RuO2. Finally, the potential application of Co2P/NPC catalyst is estimated in case of rechargeable Zn-air battery. As air electrode, Co2P/NPC achieves a power density of 154 mW cm(-2) and good long-term cycling stability (over 90 h at 5mA cm(-2)). Ourwork thus provides a facile strategy to achieve bifunctional ORR/OER performance for application in next-generation energy conversion systems.									8	1	0	0	1	0	8			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000554922000052

We adopt FeOOH to coat WO2-NaxWO3 catalyst for preventing corrosion and enhancing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in alkaline medium. Its potential rises only 18 mV after stability test at 100 mA cm(-2) for 120 h in 1.0 M KOH, while the sample without coating layer rises by 43 mV, exhibiting great durability. Meanwhile, it shows an ultra-low overpotential of 220 mV at 20 mA cm(-2), displaying good activity.

Herein, we propose a novel OER electrocatalyst based on trimetallic (Co/Ni/Cu) hydroxyphosphate with unique nanosheet array architecture grown on nickel foam, aiming at designing the non-noble-metal-based OER electrocatalyst with both excellent durability and catalytic activity. The copper hydroxyphosphate was employed with a two-step hydrothermal/ion-exchange strategy for the fabrication of the target material. Serving as an OER electrocatalyst, the obtained trimetallic (Co/Ni/Cu) hydroxyphosphate/Ni foam composite demonstrates excellent electrocatalytic activity with an low overpotential of 370 mV at 50 mA/cm(2) (vs 523 mV of RuO2) and outstanding stability of 45 h (vs 8.5 h of RuO2) in 0.1 M KOH.									16	2	0	0	1	0	16			2168-0485			WOS:000452344900098

The low-temperature lithiated spinel form of LiCoO2 (designated as LT-LiCoO2) exhibits lower overpotentials than the high-temperature layered form of LiCoO2 (designated as HT-LiCoO2), but this is shown to be a result of the increased surface area afforded by lower-temperature synthesis conditions. Raman spectroscopy, along with the presence of an irreversible peak during the first cycle of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), demonstrates that the mechanism for OER is the same for both the forms of LiCoO2. At the surface level, lithium is removed during the first cycle of the OER, forming Co3O4 on the surface, which is likely the active site during the OER. This work highlights the importance of determining the nature of the catalyst surface when investigating the electrocatalytic properties of bulk materials.									24	1	0	0	2	0	24			1932-7447			WOS:000349136400011

The prepared Mn3O4@CS/CP catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance towards ORR, with less negative onset potential and long durability. Combining the results of in-situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is revealed that Mn3O4 acts as active site for ORR to promote the transformation of OH* into OH-. In addition, Mn3O4@CS/CP possesses an excellent electrochemical OER performances with the lower overpotential along with prosper Tafel slope and robust durability. DFT calculations show the transformation from O* to OOH* is the rate determining step for OER, and Mn3O4@CS/CP shows the minimum barrier, indicating that graphene sheet on the outer of Mn3O4 improves the transformation from O* to OOH*. The oxygen electrode activity parameter (potential difference between OER at current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and ORR at current density of -2 mA/cm(2)) on Mn3O4@CS/CP is 0.72 V, which is superior to those of most bifunctional electrocatalysts reported to date, predicting a promising application in metal-air batteries and fuel cells.									19	2	0	0	3	0	19			2196-0216			WOS:000456207200011

Here, ultrathin amorphous MnO2 modified prawn shells-derived porous carbon (U-MnO2/PSNC) is designed and synthesized via a self-template assisted pyrolysis coupling in-situ redox reaction strategy. In this composite, the ultrathin amorphous MnO2 provides high surface defects and homogeneous catalytic active sites. The conductive prawn shells-derived porous carbon displays macro-meso-microporous structure, promoting electric conductivity and offering fast pathway for mass diffusion. With optimized composition, the U-MnO2-0.01/PSNC delivers an excellent bifunctional to ORR/OER with a small Delta E (bifunctional activity parameter) value of 0.776 V. Moreover, the RZAB equipped with U-MnO2-0.01/PSNC displays a considerable stability with narrow decay of battery efficiency (1.10%) for similar to 334 h (500 cycles) at 10 mA cm(-2).

J	Long Xue-mei; Li Wei-shan								Effect of bismuth content on oxygen evolution behaviors of lead-bismuth alloy in sulphuric acid solution								Chinese Journal of Power Sources				28	9			575	7						Sept. 2004	2004	Lead-bismuth alloys with Bi content from 0 to 7.33% are prepared. The oxygen evolution behavior on the prepared lead-bismuth alloys in sulphuric acid solution are studied by liner sweep voltammetry, measurement of the volume of oxygen evolution and alternative current impedance. When the Bi content in the lead-bismuth alloy is lower than 0.10%, there is no significant difference in oxygen evolution on lead-bismuth alloys and lead. However, when the Bi content in the alloy is higher than 0.83% , the effect of bismuth on oxygen evolution on lead-bismuth appears: the overpotential and the electron transfer resistance decrease and oxygen evolution volume increases with increasing Bi content in the alloys.									0	1	0		0	0	1			1002-087X			INSPEC:8224529

However, the reaction efficiencies of most developed electrocatalysts have been intrinsically limited due to their insufficient adsorption of reactants leading to high energy intermediates. Here, we establish that electronegative fluorine can moderate the binding energy between the Fe sites (FeOOH) and reactants (OH- or C2H5O-), resulting in more optimized adsorption, and can enhance the positive charge densities on the Fe sites to facilitate oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and ethanol oxidation. Consequently, a low electrolytic voltage (1.43 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2)) for H-2 production was obtained by integrating the efficiently anodic behaviors of OER and ethanol oxidation. The results reported herein point to fluorine moderation as a promising pathway for developing optimal electrocatalysts and contribute to ongoing efforts of mimicking water splitting.									62	5	0	0	3	0	62			2155-5435			WOS:000419751100052

Herein, Fe(3)O(4)with oxygen vacancies (Fe3O4-Vac) was synthesized via Ar ion irradiation method and its OER activity was greatly improved by properly modulating the electron density around Fe atoms. The electron density of Fe3O4-Vac around Fe atoms increased compared to that of Fe(3)O(4)according to the characterization of synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra, and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Moreover, the DFT results indicate the enhancement of the desorption of HOO* groups which significantly reduced the OER reaction barrier. Fe3O4-Vac catalyst shows an overpotential of 353 mV, lower than that of FeOOH (853 mV) and Fe3O4(415 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2), and a low Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1)in 1 M KOH, which was even better than commercial RuO(2)at high potential. This modulation approach provides us with valuable insights for exploring efficient and robust water-splitting electrocatalysts.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22				2575-0356		WOS:000570746500001

Herein, we demonstrate a functionalized NiRu-hydroxide (NiRu-OH) catalyst that acts as a capable candidate to immobilize highly dispersed single Pt atoms. We synthesize this catalyst by means of Ru leaching from a NiRu-layer double hydroxide (NiRu-LDH) under oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions. The hybrid catalyst shows extremely high HER activity, with an overpotential of 38 mV to drive a typical current density of 10 mA cm(geo)(-2) in alkaline media. We ascribe the excellent catalytic activity to the synergistic effect of the highly dispersed single Pt atoms and NiRu-OH in a dual-site alkaline HER mechanism. This work forms the basis for the exploration of matrices capable of trapping single atoms for various applications.									46	1	1	0	2	0	46			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000532683200061

Here, we synthesized hierarchical Co-based bimetallic sulfide nanostructures as an efficient electrocatalyst for OER. Ni3.5Co5.5S8 nanostructures were synthesized by solvothermal sulfurization and thermal annealing of pre-synthesized homogenous bimetallic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Electron microscopy studies revealed that the Ni3.5Co5.5S8 has hollow nanocage like morphology with thin nanosheets grown on the surface. In addition, Co9S8 hollow nanocages were also synthesized for comparative electrocatalytic evaluation with the Ni3.5Co5.5S8 nanosheet-assembled hollow nanocages (NAHNs). The Ni3.5Co5.5S8 NAHNs has exhibited a low over potential of 333 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (1.563 V vs RHE) and Tafel slope of 48.5 mV dec(-1) for the oxygen evolution reaction in 1 M KOH. Benefitting from their structural merits, Ni3.5Co5.5S8 NAHNs manifest excellent OER electrocatalytic activity compared to most of the recently reported non-precious catalyst for OER.

Herein, atomically dispersed Ru sites are successfully anchored on the surface of CoV layered double hydroxide (LDH), affording a vertically aligned and interconnected nanosheet array architecture. Benefitting from the strong electronic coupling, fast charge transfer capability and well-defined morphology of as-prepared catalyst, ultralow overpotentials for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, eta 10 = 28 mV) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER, eta 25 = 263 mV) are required. The two-electrode configuration cell only requires a cell voltage of 1.52 V to reach 10 mA cm-2, which is lower than that of commercialized Pt/C||RuO2 couple. Synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies in combination with density functional theory calculations reveal that the strong electronic coupling between monatomic Ru with CoV LDH induces spatial charge redistribution and a distorted coordination environment around V atoms, thereby accelerating the hydrogen release for HER and reducing the rate-determining step (O* -> OOH*) free energy for OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000863245000002

Meanwhile, the use of clean and sustainable solar energy is also crucial for renewable energy storage. Herein, a novel photo-responsive electrocatalyst with proper energy band type, i. e., n type CoS2 semiconductor decorated on p-type Co3O4 nanorod (Co3O4/CoS2), is prepared via a simple two-step hydrothermal process. Consequently, the Co3O4/CoS2 shows small overpotential of 255 mV for OER to afford current density of 10 mA cm(-2) after illumination, which is 40 mV lower than that without illumination. It also presents high electrochemically active surface areas and good stability. This significantly enhanced electrocatalytic OER performance is attributable to increased oxygen vacancies and highly active Co-S species that are electrooxidized to active site (Co3+) during OER. This work provides an effective perspective for the development of high efficiency OER catalysts based on non-noble metals combined with solar energy as a renewable energy source.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000865850500001

Time-resolved studies of the reaction of [Ru(bpy)(3)](3+) with these colloids show an initial fast electron transfer, corresponding to oxidation of Ir(III) to Ir(IV). Further oxidation of surface Ir atoms occurs concomitantly with oxygen evolution with a second-order rate constant of 1.3 x 10(6) M-1 s(-1). Both the time-resolved reduction of [Ru(bpy)(3)](3+) by IrO(x)(.)nH(2)O and the photocatalytic oxygen evolution under non-light-limited photolysis conditions have a H/D kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of 1.0. This contrasts with significantly higher KIE values for oxygen evolution from molecular cis,cis-[(bpy)(2)Ru(OH2)](2)O](4+) and [(terpy)(H2O)Mn-III(O)(2)(OH2)terpy)](3+) water oxidation catalysts. This is consistent with the conclusion that, under the conditions of most photocatalytic experiments (similar to10(-4) M [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) concentration), electron transfer from the colloid to the oxidized sensitizer rather than formation of a surface-bound hydroperoxy species is the rate-determining step in photocatalytic oxygen evolution.									135	1	0	0	17	0	135			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000224538900016

The electrocatalysts were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and N-2 adsorption-desorption. The catalytic activities of the electrocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in an alkaline electrolyte were tested using a rotating disk electrode technique. The results exhibit Co/MIL-101(Cr)-O has a higher surface Co-III content and displays higher OER activities, whereas Co/MIL-101(Cr)-R has a higher surface Co-II content and promotes higher ORR responses. However, Co/MIL-101(Cr)-O has a higher Co-III/Co-II ratio of -0.89 and displays the highest overall bifunctional activities, combining both the OER and ORR processes together. Co/MIL-101(Cr)-R and Co/MIL-101(Cr)-O also exhibit a higher durability than Co/MIL-101(Cr) does, most likely because of the enhanced interaction between the MIL-101(Cr) support and the active surface Co species that stem from the reduction or oxidation treatment.

Materials were synthesized by using nitrates of nickel and cobalt. For electrochemical studies, oxide powder was transformed in the form of oxide film electrode on nickel substrate. Techniques used were cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and anodic Tafel polarization. Results obtained show that the Ni-substitution in Co3O4 matrix increase the oxide roughness factor considerably but did not significantly contribute in electrocatalytic properties for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Tafel slope and order of reacton with respect to [OH-] concentration at low overpotential were found to be similar to 2.303RT/nF and similar to 1, respectively. The effect of temperature on the electrochemical behaviopur has also been investigated for oxide electrode. Thermodynamic parameters such as, standard electrochemical enthalpy of activation (Delta H-el(0#)), standard enthalpy of activation (Delta H-0#) and standard entropy of activation (Delta S-0#) were estimated by recording the Tafel polarization curves at different temperatures. X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared (IR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope (SEM) techniques have been used to characterize the materials physicochemically.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1480-2422	2292-1168		WOS:000545565100005

In this work, Ru-regulated hierarchical CoFe/CoFe2O4 nanoparticles with graphitic carbon shells were successfully fabricated via self-assembling and vapor reduction strategies. Our investigation uncovers high concentrations of octahedral Co3+ sites in electrocatalysts can be triumphantly acquired via moderate Ru doping, which could give rise to excellent electrocatalytic activities during OER. In addition, the design of CoFe alloys and graphitic carbon shells can compensate for the weak conductivity of cobalt ferrites. Based on the intrinsic stability, improved conductivity and activity, the as-prepared electrocatalyst yields a low overpotential of 237 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a small Tafel slope of 47 mV dec- 1 in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, exhibiting outstanding electrocatalytic activities for OER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000814690200004

Except for the advantages of core-shell structure of the electronic redistribution at the heterostructure and exposure of numerous active sites, metallic Co encapsulated into NCP was proved to be crucial to fine-tune the electronic transfer between NCP and NiCo-LDHs. The above merits rendered Co/NCP@NiCo-LDHs with improved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with a low overpotential of 277 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH solution, which is much better than the Co/NCP, NiCo-LDHs and NCP@NiCo-LDHs, and showed quite high durability. This strategy is demonstrated to be a reliable approach for improving the catalytic efficiency of LDHs catalysts. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

It has been shown that the surface content of palladium has almost no effect on the value of the polarization of the electrode. The calculated effective activation energies of oxygen evolution reaction at E = 1.6 V are 38.11 for Ti/Pt(2.0); 35.27 for Ti/Pt(2.0)-Pd(0.2) and 34.88 kJ mol(-1) for heat-treated Ti/Pt(2.0)-Pd(0.2). That is, the palladation of titanium with its subsequent heat treatment reduces the activation energy of oxygen evolution reaction compared to Ti/Pt by 3.33 kJ mol(-1). Heat treatment leads to a significant reduction of the Tafel slope in the area of oxygen evolution potentials from 232 for Ti/Pt to 86 mV on Ti/Pt-Pd. CE (NaClO) = 84-93% with CE (NaClO3) less than 0.5 % were obtained on heat-treated Ti/Pt-Pd anodes in 0.15 M NaCl.

To solve this problem in a practical way, a green and scalable method to prepare sandwich-like reduced graphene oxide /carbon black/amorphous cobalt borate nanocomposites (rGO/CB/Co-B-i) is reported. These composites are shown to be a highly efficient and robust bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this system, the spontaneous assembly of the GO sheet and CB nanoparticles is demonstrated by noncovalent interactions to build the sandwich-like structure with hierarchical pore distribution. The impressive ORR and OER activities of the obtained nanocomposite are attributed to the high conductivity, large surface area, and the hierarchically porous channels. With room-temperature synthesis and significant activities shown in the demonstrative battery test, the prepared nanocomposite can potentially serve as an alternative for noble-metal-based rechargeable ZAB cathode materials.									44	3	0	0	2	0	44			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000445444600016

Here we demonstrate that robust bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity can be achieved by inducing lattice strain in noble-metal-free metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Lattice-strained NiFe MOFs exhibit mass activities of 500 A gmetal(-1) at a half-wave potential of 0.83 V for the ORR and 2,000 A g(metal)(-1) at an overpotential of 0.30 V for the OER, which are 50-100 times that of pristine NiFe metal-organic frameworks. The catalyst maintains similar to 97% of its initial activity after 200 h of continuous ORR/OER reaction at a high current density of 100-200 mA cm(-2). Using operando synchrotron spectroscopies, we observed a key superoxide *OOH intermediate emerging on Ni4+ sites during both the ORR and OER processes, which suggests a four-electron mechanistic pathway.									398	26	0	0	25	0	401			2058-7546			WOS:000458547300012

However, the commercialization of AEMWE with non-precious metal oxide electrocatalysts is challenging due to low electrocatalytic activity and durability. Overcoming the low kinetics caused by four-electron transfer is vital in addressing the low activity of non-noble metal oxide electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction. This article overviews the synthesis methods and related techniques for various anode electrodes applied to AEMWE systems. We highlight effective strategies that have been developed to improve the performance and durability of the non-precious electrocatalysts and ensure the stable operation of AEMWE, followed by a critical perspective to encourage the development of this technology.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000697721400003

Herein, a highly stable silicon-cobalt mixed oxide thin film with a porous columnar nanostructure is proposed as electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). CoOx and CoxSiyOz layers with similar thickness were fabricated at room temperature by magnetron sputtering in a glancing angle configuration (MS-GLAD) on tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) substrates. After characterization, a comparative study of the electrocatalytic performance for OER of both layers was carried out. The excellent long-term stability as electrocatalyst for OER of the porous CoxSiyOz thin film demonstrates that the presence of silicon on the mixed oxide network increases the mechanical stability of the Si/Co layer, whilst maintaining a considerable electrocatalytic response.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000495768800001

The NiFe-LDH/RGO/NF electrode has also shown a small Tafel slope of 35 mV per decade due to the synergy effect between the larger ECSA and the conductive RGO interface.

In this study, Ni-Co-W alloy urchin-like nanostructures were fabricated by binder-free and cost-effective electrochemical deposition method at different applied current densities and HER and OER electrocatalytic activity was studied. The results of this study showed that the microstructure and morphology are strongly influenced by the electrochemical deposition parameters and the best electrocatalytic properties are obtained at the electrode created at the 20 mA.cm(-2) applied current density. The optimum electrode requires -66 mV and 264 mV, respectively, for OER and HER reactions for delivering the 10 mA cm(-2) current density. The optimum electrode also showed negligible potential change after 10 h electrolysis at 100 mA cm(-2), which means remarkable electrocatalytic stability. In addition, when this electrode used as a for full water splitting, it required only 1.58 V to create a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Such excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability can be related to the high electrochemical active surface area, being binder-free, high intrinsic electrocatalytic activity and hydrophilicity.

The specific structure synthesized by a facile method can promote the diffusion of proton acceptors in interlayer basal plan. Meanwhile, Co3Fe1-LDH shows remarkable electrocatalytic activity, the corresponding overpotential at 10 mAmiddotcm(-2) is 314 mV, and the Tafel slope is only 79.4 mVmiddotdec(-1), which owns superior performance than that of most reported LDH electrocatalytic for OER.

Interface engineering can effectively modify the active sites and promote electron transfer, resulting in improvement of electrocatalytic performance. Here, freestanding heterogeneous CoS2/CoS nanosheets are prepared via a simple one-step sintering process from a kind of novel hierarchical tremella-like metal-organic framework (MOF). The formation mechanism of the unique MOF and the heterojunctions between CoS2 and CoS is analyzed. Consequently, the prepared cost-effective OER electrocatalyst achieves satisfying electrocatalytic efficiencies with a diminutive overpotential of 269 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density, a small Tafel slope of 52 mV dec(-1), and good stability in alkaline solution comparable to RuO2 counterparts.

Therefore, the study of corresponding electrocatalysts for OER is of vital importance. However, the most-used carbon-based supports suffer from corrosion which leads to substandard performance. In this research, a series of vanadium nitrides (VN) were synthesized as supports for NiCo2O4. Compared with the pristine NiCo2O4 and NiCo2O4 supported on carbon black (NiCo2O4/C), the NiCo2O4 supported on the VN prepared in 800 degrees C (NiCo2O4/VN800) as a catalyst exhibits the best OER catalytic activity and stability. According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical characterizations, the good electrocatalytic performance of NiCo2O4/VN800 is ascribed to the high conductivity and good corrosion resistance of VN as well as the higher contents of Co2+ and Ni3+ on the catalyst surface owing to the interaction of VN and NiCo2O4.									30	1	0	0	1	0	31			2168-0485			WOS:000443924100041

A rational design of a catalyst can be guided by identifying descriptors that determine its activity. Here, a descriptor study on the ORR/OER of spinel oxides is presented. With a series of MnCo2O4, the Mn in octahedral sites is identified as an active site. This finding is then applied to successfully explain the ORR/OER activities of other transition-metal spinels, including MnxCo3-xO4 (x = 2, 2.5, 3), LixMn2O4 (x = 0.7, 1), XCo2O4 (X = Co, Ni, Zn), and XFe2O4 (X = Mn, Co, Ni). A general principle is concluded that the e(g) occupancy of the active cation in the octahedral site is the activity descriptor for the ORR/OER of spinels, consolidating the role of electron orbital filling in metal oxide catalysis.									364	25	0	0	25	0	368			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000403280600011	28394440

As-synthesized Fe-Ni3S2-MOF/NF exhibits superb OER catalytic performance in alkaline solution. It requires only 250 mV overpotential to achieve 100 mA cm(-2) current density with excellent stability of over 48 h and considerably surpasses its analogs and the benchmark RuO2 catalyst.

They confer large specific surface areas and facilitate the electron transportation for efficient OER electrocatalysis.

Interestingly, the nitrate (NO3-) endows the formation of alpha-Fe2O3 while sulphate (SO42-) endows the formation of alpha-FeOOH. Thus, the prepared alpha-Fe2O3 and alpha-FeOOH were systematically characterized by using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energydispersive X-ray (EDX) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The SEM image reveals alpha-Fe2O3 and alpha-FeOOH were composed of microspheres and nanorods respectively. Further, the prepared alpha-Fe2O3 microspheres and alpha-FeOOH nanorods were used as potential electrocatalyst to catalyse oxygen evolution reaction (OER) where alpha-FeOOH nanorods were recognized as best OER catalyst with low overpotential of 333 mV at 10 mA cm 2 and stability over 20 h.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1293-2558	1873-3085		WOS:000591261700005

High-performance Ni-V-Fe metal-organic framework electrocatalyst composed of integrated nanowires and nanosheets for oxygen evolution reaction								MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY				16						100419	10.1016/j.mtener.2020.100419				JUN 2020	2020	Rational design of nanostructured metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for catalytic applications is an ongoing challenge. Here, a new hierarchical NiVFe-MOF composed of self-supported nanowires and nanosheets are first prepared through substrate-assisted solvothermal growth. The MOF nanowires and nanosheets are tightly assembled into an integrated nanostructure with facile mass transfer. At the same time, the microstructure of the nanowires/nanosheets exhibits abundant active sites due to the hierarchical porosity. As resultant NiVFe-MOF exhibits significantly enhanced activity in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The resulting MOF yields a low overpotential (225 mV, 10 mA cm(-2); 269 mV, 100 mA cm(-2)) and high stability after long-term cycling test, suggesting a state-of-the-art performance. This study can provide new insights on rational design and synthesis of nanostructured MOFs for catalytic applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we adopt oxygen-enriched carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by acid etching treatment as the cathode, in which a low voltage plateau at similar to 3.5 V during charge is exhibited and the initial round-trip efficiency is increased from 69.9% to 76.0%. An optimized integration of electrocatalytic property and electrical conductivity is crucial for the oxidized CNTs cathode to enhance the capacity and cycling performance. In particular, the surface oxygen groups can facilitate the electrocatalysis of O-2 with the enhanced oxygen reduction reaction activity and induce defective lithium peroxide (Li-O-2 ) formation due to their preferential adsorption of O-2 on the oxidized CNTs. Compared to the high crystalline Li-O-2 toroids, the defective Li-O-2 with poor crystallinity could be decomposed at a lower charge potential, contributing to the enhanced round-trip efficiency of Li-O(2 )batteries.

Herein, we develop a windowless thin layer electrochemical cell design to improve the detection efficiency of in-situ Raman spectroscopy for practical nanoscale electrocatalysts. This was achieved by perforating a hole in the optical window of the cell, which not only eliminates the refraction of light by the window but also induces a meniscus thin electrolyte layer on the working electrode, thus significantly improving the detection efficiency of Raman spectra. We successfully applied thismethod to conduct in-situ Raman spectroscopy of structural evolutions of two representative Ni-Fe oxide catalysts (layered double hydroxides and spinel oxides) during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysis. It was shown that both catalysts underwent surface transformation to oxyhydroxides and formed active oxygen species at OER relevant potentials. However, the extent of the surface transformation was much lower on the Ni-Fe spinel catalyst, accounting for its lower OER activity. We further show that adding a carbon support can promote the surface transformation of Ni-Fe spinel to oxyhydroxides, thus significantly increasing the electrocatalytic activities. The established windowless thin layer method provides a new way to conduct in-situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy of a wide range of materials and may be also combined with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopic methods.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000554922000020

We integrate La0.75Sr0.25Mn0.5Co0.5O3-delta, a perovskite with a limited electronic conductivity, in electrode compositions with either carbon materials (pyrolytic carbon of the Sibunit family - Sibunit-152, furnace black - Vulcan XC-72R, and Acetylene black) or silver nanoparticles, and investigate their OER activity in 1M NaOH solution. We apply the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique to separate the OER currents from those originating from corrosion of the additives under anodic polarization. We conclude that certain carbon materials would be better suited for use as conductive additives for oxide-based OER catalysts than silver particles. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, porous catalysts with high conductivity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have attracted more attention. Here, a quaternary inorganic framework consisting of Ni-0 and Ni(OH)(2), graphite-like C, and titanate nanotubes (referred to as the Ni-x/C/TNT framework) has been successfully fabricated. Compared to the precious Pt/C for the HER and IrO2/C for the OER, the fabricated Ni-x/C/TNT framework exhibited high activities towards water splitting. At a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), its OER overpotential is as small as 280 mV while its HER overpotential is as small as 145 mV. The excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to its unique structure of the Ni-x/C/TNT framework that can effectively expand the interface, maximize the reacting sites, and thus guarantee rapid mass and electron transfer.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000354395400052

NiFe-based layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) nanosheets have been regarded as the most efficient electrocatalysis for oxygen evolution. However, the limited catalytic active site and the stacking layer limited the performance. Therefore, by introducing highly electroactive Co ions into monolayer NiFe-LDH, the obtained ternary NiFeCo-LDH monolayer structure possessed an increased concentration of defect (oxygen and metal vacancies), providing enough unsaturated coordination sites, benefitting the electrocatalytic water oxidation, as also explained by the density functional theory (DFT). This work reported an efficient strategy for the synthesis of ternary monolayer LDH in the application of energy conversion and storage.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				1996-1944		WOS:000606071200001	33406720

Defect engineering has been extensively developed to tune the electrocatalytic activity for OER. Compared to the anion vacancies in metal oxides, cation vacancies are more challenging to selectively generate, and the insight into the structure and activity of cation vacancies-rich catalysts are lacked. Herein, using SnCoFe perovskite hydroxide as a precursor, abundant Sn vacancies on the surface were preferentially produced by Ar plasma. Sn vacancies could be preferentially produced as confirmed by the X-ray absorption spectra, probably owing to the lower lattice energy and weaker chemical bonds of Sn(OH)(4). The Sn vacancies promoted the exposure of active CoFe sites, resulting in an amorphous surface layer, modulated the conductivity, and thus enhanced the OER performance.									262	23	0	0	9	0	266			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000437668700060	29771458

However, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) lower their energy conversion efficiencies. Herein, we in situ grow amorphous NiSx-FeOy particles on sulfur doped carbon fiber paper (termed as NiSx-FeOy/SCFP) as practical self-supported oxygen electrode through a simple and economic synthesis route. Benefiting from the synergetic effects of amorphous NiSx-FeOy and SCFP, NiSx-FeOy/SCFP possesses massively accessible active sites, enhanced electrons and reactants transfer, and stable integrated structure, exhibiting a low overpotential (0.37 V) at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, a positive half-wave potential for ORR and a small potential gap (0.82 V). Zinc air flow battery assembled with newly developed NiSx-FeOy/SCFP shows a coulombic efficiency of 100% and a voltage efficiency of 50% at the charge-discharge current of 10 mA cm(-2), and vigorously operates 110 h without performance decay, showing highly catalytic activity and super cycling stability, which are among the best performance ever reported.

Electrocatalysts can promote the sluggish oxygen evolution process involving four-electron transfer. Herein, we prepare mesoporous spinel oxide nanosheets and develop an efficient strategy using Fe substitution to enable mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanosheets to generate superior active centers for the OER. Additionally, the iron substitution also promotes the preoxidation of Co/Ni and facilitates the formation of active species. Raman spectroscopy data reveal that the active species of mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanosheets for the OER is NiCo2O4 itself, and the active species of Fe substitution in NiCo2O4 nanosheets are Ni(Co) oxyhydroxides. Therefore, the iron substitution is beneficial to facilitate the transformation of spinel NiCo2O4 into active Ni(Co) oxyhydroxides under OER conditions. Owing to the mesoporous nanosheet structure and the formation of oxyhydroxide active species, the optimized mesoporous Fe0.2Ni0.8Co2O4 nanosheet catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 270 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 39 mV dec(-1) for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000753447800088	34841871

Herein, we report a facile sonication-driven synthesis to deposit the molecular manganese vanadium oxide precursor [Mn4V4O17(OAc)(3)](3-) on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Thermal conversion of this composite at 900 degrees C gives nanostructured manganese vanadium oxides/carbides, which are stably linked to the MWCNTs. The resulting composites show excellent electrochemical reactivity for ORR and OER, and significant reactivity enhancements compared with the precursors and a Pt/C reference are reported. Notably, even under harsh acidic conditions, long-term OER activity at low overpotential is reported. In addition, we report exceptional activity of the composites for the industrially important Cl-2 evolution from an aqueous HCl electrolyte. The new composite material shows how molecular deposition routes leading to highly active and stable multifunctional electrocatalysts can be developed. The facile design could in principle be extended to multiple catalyst classes by tuning of the molecular metal oxide precursor employed.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000481139800001	31106936

However, the overpotential of the UOR is still high due to the complicated 6e(-) transfer process and adsorption/desorption of intermediate products. Herein, utilizing a cation exchange strategy, Ni-doped CuO nanoarrays grown on 3D Cu foam are synthesized. Notably, Ni-CuO NAs/CF requires a low potential of 1.366 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode to drive a current density of 100 mA cm(-2), outperforming various benchmark electrocatalysts and maintaining robust stability in alkaline media. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal that Ni as the driving force center can effectively enhance the urea adsorption and stabilize CO*/NH* intermediates toward the UOR. These findings suggest a new direction for constructing nanostructures and modulating electronic structures, ultimately developing promising Cu-based electrode catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2198-3844		WOS:000870539300001	36266984

We explore the temporal evolution of the density of the ground state oxygen molecule O-2(X-1 Sigma(-)(g)), the singlet metastable oxygen molecules O-2(a(1)Delta(g)) and O-2(b(1) Sigma(g)), the oxygen atom in the ground state O(P-3), the metastable oxygen atom O(D-1), the positive ions O-2(+) and O+, and the negative ion O-. We furthermore investigate the reaction rates for the gain and loss of these species. The density of atomic oxygen increases significantly as we move from the metal mode to the transition mode, and finally into the compound (poisoned) mode. The main gain rate responsible for the increase is sputtering of atomic oxygen from the oxidized target. Both in the poisoned mode and in the transition mode, sputtering makes up more than 80% of the total gain rate for atomic oxygen. We also investigate the possibility of depositing stoichiometric TiO2 in the transition mode. Published by AIP Publishing.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			0021-8979	1089-7550		WOS:000400623700019		
J	Noguchi, Takumi				Noguchi, Takumi/I-7105-2014				Light-induced FTIR difference spectroscopy as a powerful tool toward understanding the molecular mechanism of photosynthetic oxygen evolution								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				91	1			59	69		10.1007/s11120-007-9137-5				JAN 2007	2007	The molecular mechanism of photosynthetic oxygen evolution remains a mystery in photosynthesis research. Although recent X-ray crystallographic studies of the photosystem II core complex at 3.0-3.5 angstrom resolutions have revealed the structure of the oxygen-evolving center (OEC), with approximate positions of the Mn and Ca ions and the amino acid ligands, elucidation of its detailed structure and the reactions during the S-state cycle awaits further spectroscopic investigations. Light-induced Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectroscopy was first applied to the OEC in 1992 as detection of its structural changes upon the S-1 -> S-2 transition, and spectra during the S-state cycle induced by consecutive flashes were reported in 2001. These FTIR spectra provide extensive structural information on the amino acid side groups, polypeptide chains, metal core, and water molecules, which constitute the OEC and are involved in its reaction. FTIR spectroscopy is thus becoming a powerful tool in investigating the reaction mechanism of photosynthetic oxygen evolution. In this mini-review, the measurement method of light-induced FTIR spectra of OEC is introduced and the results obtained thus far using this technique are summarized.									71	0	0	0	51	0	71			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000245121800006	17279438

Herein, a one-step NH3/Ar plasma treatment method was used to obtain few-layered and nitrogen-doped Ti3C2Tx MXene. The structural properties and nitrogen content of MXene were adjusted by controlling the volume ratio of NH3 and Ar in the plasma gas. When the volume ratio of ammonia-to-argon was 6:1, the obtained Ti3C2Tx-N6 had the largest C lattice parameter (13.53 angstrom), the highest nitrogen content (1.57 wt%), and the lowest HER overpotential of 119.17 mV. The XPS results and DFT calculations showed that Ti3C2Tx-N6 introduced the most surfaceadsorbed N, which reduced the energy barrier of electrocatalytic reactions of MXene.									11	1	0	0	1	0	11			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000664200900001

Herein, we report an unprecedented ruthenium-nickel (Ru-Ni) heterostructure with phase-segregated sandwich-like morphology for boosting electrocatalysis. The Ru selectively grows at the two ends of the Ni pillar, in which intimate interfaces is formed between Ru and Ni domains. We found such Ru-Ni sandwiched nanoplates (SNs) are highly efficient for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes with very low overpotentials and Tafel slopes. Significantly, the optimized Ru-Ni SNs deliver a low onset potential of only 1.45 V and enhanced durability in the overall water splitting device, indicating a promising electrocatalyst towards the practical alkaline electrolysis.									93	3	0	0	3	0	93			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000430057000001

The oxide films were prepared on non-conducting glasses, glass-CdO films and nickel foils at 530-degrees-C by spray pyrolysis. The oxide films were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscopy, electrochemical stability and roughness factor measurements. The electrocatalytic studies were carried out in the stationary state by potentiostatic polarization techniques (potentials corrected for ohmic drop). The influence of deposited oxide weight and the substrate effect on the electrochemical reactivities is shown. On the nickel substrate oxygen evolution was observed to occur at a lower potential than on the CdO substrate. The reaction order partial-log i/partial-log C(OH)- was found to be between 1.2 and 1.4 and was related to applied potential. Tafel slopes decreased with increased film thickness. Electrokinetic parameters suggest similar mechanisms for oxygen evolution on both substrates.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			0040-6090			WOS:A1991FG71500016

Here, we report a self-standing cobalt disulfide/graphite foam (CoS2/GF) electrocatalytic electrode for this purpose. It showed high catalytic activities for both the HER and OER, requiring only a cell voltage of 1.74 V to achieve a current density of 20 mA cm (-2) for overall water splitting in an alkaline electrolyte.

FeCo2S4/NF exhibits ultrahigh areal capacitance of 7.37 F cm(-2) at current density of 5 mA cm(-2) and achieves good cycling stability retaining 92% capacitance after 3000 cycles at 10 mA cm(-2). Symmetric solid-state device of FeCo2S4/NF as positive and negative electrodes delivers a remarkable energy density of 19.12 W h kg(-1) (434.61 W kg(-1)). Furthermore, FeCo2S4/NF electrode delivers a low overpotential of 155 mV at a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and shows no obvious attenuation after stability test for 100,000 s in 1 M KOH solution. While a low overpotential of 234 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be demonstrated in alkaline environment as an anode electrocatalyst. FeCo2S4/NF shows excellent activity toward overall water splitting with 10 mA cm(-2) by applying just 1.405 V across the two electrodes. Hence, the porous mesh-like FeCo2S4 nanosheet arrays on Ni foam are promising electrode materials for supercapacitor application and water splitting.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2365-6549			WOS:000458690100007

Here we report an implementation of 8% efficient photoanode based on the photoelectrolysis of saturated NaCl solution. Replacing the OER with the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) has transformed both the thermodynamic basis and the kinetic process of the photoelectrolysis, more chemical energy can be produced with much less driving force. The RuO2/TiO2/n-Si photoanode exhibits a high rate of photoelectrochemical conversion (35 mA/cm(2) at equilibrium potential), which steadily and exclusively produces Cl-2 without detectable O-2.

Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and their derivatives (e.g., transition metal alloys, oxides, sulfides, nitrides and phosphides) have been adopted as catalysts for various electrochemical reactions, such as oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, hydrogen evolution, and CO2 reduction, which show excellent activity and remarkable durability in electrocatalytic process. In this review, the synthesis strategies, structural characters and electrochemical performances for the LDHs and their derivatives are described. In addition, we also discussed the effect of electronic and geometry structures to their electrocatalytic activity.

In these structures, NiCo2O4 nanosheets are coated on NiCo2O4 nanocones, which are decorated on the surface of conductive NF. As an oxygen evolution reaction catalyst, the NiCo2O4@NiCo2O4 exhibits low overpotential of 440 mV at the current density of 100 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the composite shows outstanding long-term stability during 12 h continuous operation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) reveals that the charge transfer resistance of NiCo2O4@NiCo2O4 is much smaller than other composites. The results reveal that the composite exhibits superior activity for OER in contrast to individual NiCo2O4 nanosheets or NiCo2O4 nanocones, which are attributed to the NiCo2O4@NiCo2O4 composite and integrate multiple advantages of nanostructures, abundant catalytic sites and outstanding stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-6412		WOS:000858161400001

Metal phosphides are promising for integrating hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) properties in one bifunctional electrode, but several challenges still exist and need to be solved. We report a free-standing carbon cloth electrode consisting of iron (Fe)-doped Nisi), nanosheet arrays via a hydrothermal reaction and subsequent phosphorization, which effectively drives both HER and OER in the base. The as-prepared Fe-doped Ni5P4 with ultralow Fe conent (2.5 atom %) delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 131 mV for HER and needs 257 mV to reach a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for OER Overall, water splitting requires only 1.50 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The introduction of trace Fe in NisP(4) is effective to modulate the adsorption energy of the key intermediates for both HER and OER, which is promising for the rational design of transition-metal phosphides based on bifunctional water-splitting catalysts with high performance. In particular, Fe-doped NisP(4) could effectively catalyze the hydrolysis of NaBH4 with a hydrogen generation rate of 0.175 L g(-1) min(-1) and an activation energy of 53.41 kJ mol(-1), comparable to most transition-metal-based electrocatalysts.									24	0	0	0	2	0	24			2574-0970			WOS:000469410000056

Therefore, the design and fabrication of highly active, durable, and cost-effective electrocatalysts are crucial. Here, we demonstrate the graphene/Ni-Fe layered double-hydroxide (RGO-Ni-Fe LDH) composite as highly active and durable electrocatalyst for OER, which exhibits excellent OER activity with a small overpotential (similar to 250 mV in 0.1 M KOH) based on the onset of catalytic current and stability.

The critical challenges in the development of Na-O-2 batteries include the elucidation of the reaction mechanism, reaction products, and the structural and chemical evolution of the reaction products and their correlation with battery performance. For the first time, in situ transmission electron microscopy was employed to probe the reaction mechanism and structural evolution of the discharge products in Na-O-2 batteries. The discharge product was featured by the formation of both cubic and conformal NaO2. It was noticed that the impingement of the reaction product (NaO2) led to particle coarsening through coalescence. We investigated the stability of the discharge product and observed that the reaction product NaO2 was stable in the case of the solid electrolyte. The present work provides unprecedented insight into the development of Na-O-2 batteries.									20	2	0	0	0	0	21			2380-8195			WOS:000425560900021

We present an approach for the determination of the onset potentials based on scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) using the "substrate generation-tip collection" mode. In the proposed method, the potential applied to the catalyst sample is changed stepwise. A micro-electrode serving as SECM tip is positioned in known close proximity to the catalyst surface and is used to detect the onset of the formation of the product of the catalytic reaction, specifically gas generation at the sample surface. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at model RuO2 and perovskite catalyst surfaces is used to evaluate the approach. The suggested method is supposed to provide a clearer and sensitive means for the detection of the onset potentials of electrolytic gas evolution reactions as compared to conventional procedures which mainly use cyclic voltammetry on stationary or rotating (ring) disk electrodes. Moreover, the detection of the reaction product at the SECM tip allows distinguishing between parasitic reactions at the catalyst surface and the true formation of the anticipated reaction product.

Developing catalysts with low overpotential and high intrinsic activity toward OER is critical but challenging. Here we report a major advancement in decreasing the overpotential for oxygen evolution reaction. Ni foam-supported Fe-doped beta-Ni(OH)(2) nano sheets achieve an overpotential of 219 mV at the geometric current density of 10 mA cm(-2). To our knowledge, this is the best value reported for Ni- or Fe hydroxide-based OER catalysts. In addition, the catalyst yields a current density of 6.25 mA cm(-2) at the overpotential of 300 mV when it is normalized to the electro-chemical surface area of the catalyst. This intrinsic catalytic activity is also better than the values reported for most state-of-the-art OER catalysts at the same overpotential.									153	3	0	0	9	0	154			2380-8195			WOS:000461271600002

Herein, the hierarchical CuO dandelion-like materials assembled from numerous ultrathin nanosheets are directly grown on Cu foil to produce a 3D oxygen evolution anode (CuO NSDs/CF). As a result of its integrated configuration and high electrocatalytic active sites, the anode exhibits superior electrocatalytic water oxidation activity in 1.0 M NaOH solution, associated with a small overpotential of 370 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 41 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, the anode can maintain a relatively stable current density at 1.65 V versus RHE for at least 24 h, and a high Faradaic efficiency of 98% is also achieved.									31	1	0	0	5	0	32			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000427678800021

To be one of the most active oxygen evolution reaction catalysts in alkaline media, Ni-Fe based compounds have attracted tremendous attention, while the role of Ni and Fe sites played has still come under debate. Herein, by taking the pyrrhotite Fe7S8 nanosheets with mixed-valence states and metallic conductivity for examples, we illustrate that Fe could be a highly active site for electro-catalytic oxygen evolution. It is shown that the delocalized electrons in the ultrathin Fe7S8 nanosheets could facilitate electron transfer processes of the system, where d orbitals of Fe-II and Fe-III would be overlapped with each other during the catalytic reactions, rendering the ultrathin Fe7S8 nanosheets to be the most efficient Fe-based electrocatalyst for water oxidation. As expected, the ultrathin Fe7S8 nanosheets exhibit promising electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activities, with a low overpotential of 0.27 V and a large current density of 300 mA cm(-2) at 0.5 V. This work provides solid evidence that Fe could be an efficient active site for electrocatalytic water splitting.									104	6	0	0	4	0	105			2374-7943	2374-7951		WOS:000416519700014	29202024

With a longer reaction time of 120h, a rod-shape morphology is obtained, whereas at 72 and 24h assemblies of nanoparticles are obtained. The rod-shaped (120h) particles of the Cu/Cu2O nanocomposites show a much higher efficiency (6.3 times) than the agglomerates and 2.5 times more than the assemblies of nanoparticles for the hydrogen-evolution reaction. During the oxygen-evolution reaction, the nanorods produce a current that is 5.2 and 3.7 times higher than that produced by the agglomerated and assembled nanoparticles, respectively. The electrocatalysts are shown to be highly stable for over 50 cycles. As catalysts for organic synthesis, a 100% yield is achieved in the Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction with the nanorods, which is higher than with the other nanocomposite particles. This result demonstrates the significant enhancement of yield obtained with the nanorods for cross-coupling reactions.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000367827700019	26548768

However, the conventional approach for doping heteroatoms into the carbon matrix remains a huge challenge owing to multistep postdoping procedures. Here, a self-templated carbonization strategy to prepare a nitrogen, phosphorus, and fluorine tri-doped carbon nanosphere (NPF-CNS) is developed, during which a heteroatom-enriched covalent triazine polymer serves as a "self-doping" precursor with C, N, P, and F elements simultaneously, avoiding the tedious and inefficient postdoping procedures. Introducing F enhances the electronic structure and surface wettability of the as-obtained catalyst, beneficial to improve the electrocatalytic performance. The optimized NPF-CNS catalyst exhibits a superb electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, long-term durability in pH-universal conditions as well as outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in an alkaline electrolyte. These superior ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalytic activities are attributed to the predesigned heteroatom catalytic active sites and high specific surface areas of NPF-CNS. As a demonstration, a zinc-air battery using the NPF-CNS cathode displays a high peak power density of 144 mW cm(-2) and great stability during 385 discharging/charging cycles, surpassing that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst.									55	0	0	0	3	0	55			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000583797400001	33140583

The graphene shell is enriched with defects that play an important role in facilitating the catalytic process and reactant transport. This material shows highly trifunctional catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oirygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolutiort action in an alkaline electrolyte solution. The multifunctional catalytic activity is attributed to the catalyst's multinietallic property. The thin layer of spinel oxides is enriched with oxygen vacancies that increase the catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction and enhance the stability. The ORR. activity and stability is comparable to that of 10% Pt/C, and the OER performance is comparable to that of Ir-black. An application of this functional material is explored. A zinc/air battery with FeCoNiOx@NG as the cathode catalyst is designed, assembled, and tested. The zinc/air battert exhibits a good rechargeable cycling performance, which corresponds to the excellent capability of OER/ORR catalytic cycles.									13	1	0	0	1	0	14			2574-0970			WOS:000555518200097

Herein, we report the in situ synthesized MOF-derived CoPO hollow polyhedron nanostructures by simultaneous high temperature annealing and Ar-N-2 radio frequency plasma treatment in the presence of a P precursor and subsequent oxygen incorporation from open air at lower temperature. The optimum Ar-N-2 gas flow rates are used to precisely tune the P/O ratio, cut Co bonds within the MOFs and reconnect Co with P. Consequently, both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance are enhanced. Meanwhile, the filling of P elements can effectively change the electronic structure around the catalyst to ensure the uniform distribution of catalytically active sites. The resultant CoPO hollow nanocages with large specific surface areas show excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity towards both HER and OER with a low overpotential of 105 and 275 mV and a small Tafel slope of 48 and 52 mV dec(-1), respectively. Our results open a new avenue for precise plasma-assisted engineering of MOF-derived hybrid hetero-structured electrocatalysts with rich oxygen vacancies and P dopants to simultaneously boost both half reactions in water electrolysis.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000631728600001	33885606

Herein, with the help of theoretical studies, we show that anatase-type TiO2-IrO(2)solid solutions possess more active iridium catalytic sites for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) than IrO2, the benchmark OER catalyst. Note that the same is not observed for their rutile-type counterparts. However, owing to their thermodynamic metastability, anatase-type TiO2-IrO(2)solid solutions are generally hard to synthesize. Our theoretical studies demonstrate that such catalytically active anatase-type solid-solution phases can be created in situ on the surfaces of readily available SrTiO3-SrIrO(3)solid solutions during electrocatalysis in acidic solution as the solution can etch away Sr atoms. We experimentally show this with porous SrTiO3-SrIrO(3)solid-solution nanotubes synthesized by a facile synthetic route that contain 56 % less iridium than IrO(2)yet show an order of magnitude higher apparent catalytic activity for OER in acidic solution.									48	3	0	0	2	0	47			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000543826100001	32485084

XVII. Symmetry Breaking in Manganese Cluster Structures and Chameleonic Mechanisms for the O-O Bond Formation of Water Splitting Reaction								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY				112	1	SI		121	135		10.1002/qua.23255				JAN 2012	2012	Symmetry breaking in cluster structures of manganese oxides by doping of Ca(II) ion is examined in relation to chameleonic mechanisms of water splitting reaction. The orbital and spin correlation diagrams have been depicted to clarify one-electron transfer and electron-pair transfer mechanisms for the reaction. The spin-polarized molecular orbital models have been applied to elucidate correspondence between magnetic-coupling mode and reaction mechanism of the oxygen-oxygen (O-O) bond formation and oxygen evolution catalyzed by multicenter Ca(II) manganese oxides and related systems. The present UB3LYP calculations followed by the natural orbital analyses have been performed to elucidate electronic structures of the key intermediates and the transition state structure for the O-O bond formation. The results indicate that the reaction proceeds through the continuous diradicaloid mechanism without discreet free radical fragments and/or electron-pair transfer mechanism induced by symmetry breaking with Ca(II) in the pure low-spin singlet state. The computational results are compatible with local singlet and triplet diradical-coupling mechanisms for the O-O bond formation in the low-and high-spin states, respectively. Thus, magnetic (exchange) coupling modes in the oxygen evolution complex are directly related to the local singlet and triplet diradical mechanisms as in the case of soluble methane monooxygenase.

It is essential to search a facile anodic reaction to replace OER in the hydrogen generation process. Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is an alternative strategy to instead of OER in the water splitting reaction. Based on this, we successfully prepare two-dimensional (2D) CoP nanosheets embedded by carbon nanoparticles (CoP/C) composites as bifunctional catalysts to achieve hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at cathode and UOR at anode simultaneously. Benefiting from the presence of carbon particles and 2D sheet structure of CoP in the composites, the contact area of electrolyte/electrode is enlarged, the exposed active sites are increased, and charge transfer rate is improved. As the anode and cathode catalysts in a two-electrode system with continuous electrolyte supplementation by a flow reactor, the CoP/C-3 composite only need 1.40 V to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in the 1 M KOH electrolyte with 0.1 M urea. This study on hydrogen generation and urea oxidation at a low potential provides a promising method to prepare bifunctional catalysts for practical applications.									23	0	0	0	2	0	23			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000512983600029

So far, scientists have been involved broadly in utilizing smaller carbon-based molecules to modify the CN framework for better-quality solar to fuel energy conversion. Still, the modification of material with a natural macromolecule has been explored insufficiently. In this regard, we firstly a copolymerized carbon nitride (CNPx) by conjugating a novel monomer 2,6-dibenzolumazine with CN through molecular integration (CNPx). The copolymerized catalysts demonstrated noteworthy improvement in photocatalytic activities as compared to pristine CN. Following this, we further combine our superior sample (CNP5.0) with the underlying biomass-based lignin molecules forming CNP-Lx. The biomass-modified CNP-Lx obtained through this process has an increased HER and OER under visible light (lambda=420 nm). Findings demonstrate the catalytic performance seven times higher for CNP-Lx and three times enhanced for CNPx sample than CN catalyst. These improvements can be attributed to the ultrathin nanostructure and efficient visible light absorption of the CN, well-balanced exciton states of the organic monomer, and the synergetic effect of lignin synergetic effect on its surface. Lignin-activated CNP5.0 photocatalysts produced through this method can prove cost-effective and efficient alternatives for solar overall water splitting.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			2468-8231			WOS:000737750300002

The reasonable control of the Co2+/Co3+ ratio is the principal pathway to improve the electrocatalytic activity of Co3O4. Therefore, we designed a Co3O4 electrocatalyst supported on Ni foam by a two-step method of prehydrothermal method and post-heat treatment in special atmosphere, which not only formed porous nanoclusters, but also acquired oxygen vacancies on the surface of samples with more Co2+. As a result, the electrocatalyst with oxygen vacancies can achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) with a low overpotential of 343 mV and a modest Tafel slope of 79.5 mV/dec for OER in 0.1 M KOH solution. That is because the generation of oxygen vacancies increased the conductivity of the catalyst and created more active sites for OER. This work provide further insight about inducing oxygen vacancies method into the cost-effective and better performance transition metal oxide-based catalysts for electrochemical applications.

The design of inexpensive metal catalysts exhibiting desired catalytic performance and durable stability for efficient oxygen evolution is the pursuit of sustainable and clean energy fields. Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) flower-like NiSe2 primary structure, modified with highly dispersed CuSe2 nanoclusters as the secondary structure, is obtained by regulating the growth trend of the nanosheets. Benefiting from the metallicity of selenides and the formation of a heterogeneous interface, NiSe2@CuSe2/NF shows comparable performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline environment. Upon regulating the synthesis conditions, the catalyst exhibits its optimal performance with ultralow overpotential for the OER when the Ni/Cu molar ratio is 1 : 0.2 and the hydrothermal temperature and hydrothermal time are 200 degrees C and 6 h, respectively.

Electrolyte alkali metal cations have been shown to modify the activity and reaction intermediates, however, the exact mechanism is at question due to unexplained deviations from the cation size trend. Our X-ray absorption spectroelectrochemical results show that bigger cations shift the Ni2+/(3+delta)+ redox peak and OER activity to lower potentials (however, with typical discrepancies), following the order CsOH>NaOH approximate to KOH>RbOH>LiOH. Here, we find that the OER activity follows the variations in electrolyte pH rather than a specific cation, which accounts for differences both in basicity of the alkali hydroxides and other contributing anomalies. Our density functional theory-derived reactivity descriptors confirm that cations impose negligible effect on the Lewis acidity of Ni, Fe, and O lattice sites, thus strengthening the conclusions of an indirect pH effect. It is commonly accepted that electrolyte alkali metal cations modify the catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction. Here the authors challenge this assumption, showing that the activity is actually affected by a change in the electrolyte pH rather than a specific alkali cation.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23				2041-1723		WOS:000598904000001	33268768

However, to minimize the electrocatalysts' fabrication costs, developing bifunctional electrocatalysts has been proposed as a profitable strategy. Herein, the Ni-Co-B film was fabricated on a Cu sheet surface by a one-step and facile electrodeposition method. The optimized sample showed noticeable electrocatalytic activity for total water splitting. The required overpotential for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at -10 mA cm(-2) current density was recorded to be -145 mV, and in the case of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), this value was 276 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The unique morphology of the optimized Ni-Co-B sample with a high number of spherical micro-nodules was proposed to be responsible for this high HER and OER catalytic activity. Moreover, the optimized value of the B, Ni, and Co in the coating was highly important in facilitating the electrochemical reactions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the better electrocatalytic activity of the Ni-Co-B electrode is due to the regulate the electronic structure and new active catalytic sites which are created by Co incorporation. Finally, the binder-free approach of fabricating the coating resulted in the long-time high stability of the fabricated Ni-Co-B/Cu electrode at high current densities. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, inspired by the appropriate H atoms binding energy of Co metal, favorable OER reaction kinetics of cobalt oxides, and more efficient electron transfer of self-supported structure, Co/CoO anchored on N-doped carbon layer coated on carbon cloth (Co/CoO@NC@CC) is synthesized by a facile self-assembly-carbonization method. Remarkably, the Co/CoO@NC@CC exhibits much increased electrochemical activities toward both OER and HER with low overpotentials of 284 and 152 mV required to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm-2, respectively, which are superior to most of the reported Co-based and CoO-based catalysts. More importantly, the fabricated Co/CoO@NC@CC? Co/CoO@NC@CC electrolyzer only needs a small cell voltage of 1.66 V for driving overall water splitting to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm-2. Moreover, the Co/CoO@NC@CC behaves superior stability after 25 h of continuous operation. Excellent features including the synergistic effect between Co and CoO, unique hierarchical porous structure, and selfsupported construction jointly impart Co/CoO@NC@CC highly elevated bifunctional electrocatalytic activities.									51	0	0	0	5	0	51			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000641348600002

After a simple ethanol-assisted grinding and subsequent annealing process, the modified NiCo2O4 catalysts (NiCo2O4-FeF3-A) exhibit a superior OER catalytic activity and stability compared with other controlled samples. The overpotential value to drive the standard OER current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH electrolyte is only 260 mV, significantly decreasing by as large as 110 mV relative to the pristine NiCo2O4. In addition, negligible degeneration is observed during accelerated durability tests (ADTs) for 5000 cycles, confirming the strong interaction between oxide substrates and modified ions. The enhancement of electro-catalytic activity can be attributed to the effective and accelerated charge-transfer process induced by surface electronic state reconstruction.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0947-8396	1432-0630		WOS:000578603400001

Mo-based and Ni-based sulfides, which have respectively shown excellent catalytic activity in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), can remedy the shortcomings of single half-reaction by synergistic effect. Herein, we realized the in-situ growth of Co-doped NiS2/MoS2 nanosheet on CFP (Co-NiS2/MoS2) using a two-step hydrothermal method. The Co-NiS2/MoS2 nanosheets exhibit superior activity for durable HER and OER, obviously superior to those of the single-structure catalysts. Moreover, the cell voltage is only 1.63 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting. The density functional theory simulation results show the hydrogen adsorption energy in Co-NiS2/MoS2 system is closer to zero than others, further suggesting heterostructure can reduce energy barrier of water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000818780200002

A novel twin reactor was designed to separate the evolution of hydrogen and oxygen in photocatalytic water splitting under visible light. A modified Nafion membrane was employed to segregate the two photocatalysts in the twin reactor so that hydrogen and oxygen can be evolved separately. Conventional Z-scheme catalysts, Pt/SrTiO3:Rh and WO3, were used as hydrogen-photocatalyst and oxygen-photocatalyst, respectively. Fe2+ and Fe3+ were added in the reaction solution as electron-transfer mediator. The ratio of evolved H-2 and O-2 was in agreement with the stoichiometric ratio (2:1) of hydrogen and oxygen of water. An average hydrogen generation rate of 1.59 mu mol/g-h was achieved in the twin-reactor system, which was twice as much as that in the conventional Z-scheme system. The improved H2 yield was due to the prevention of the water-splitting backward reaction in the twin reactor. (C) 2009 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, most Li-O(2)batteries are based on the reduction/oxidation of Li(2)O(2)and involve highly reactive superoxide and peroxide species that would cause serious degradation of cathodes, especially carbon-based materials. It is important to explore lithium-oxygen reactions and find new Li-O(2)chemistry which can restrict or even avoid the negative influence of superoxide/peroxide species. Here, inspired by enzyme-catalyzed oxygen reduction/oxidation reactions, we introduce a copper(I) complex 3 N-Cu-I(3 N=1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane) to Li-O(2)batteries and successfully modulate the reaction pathway to a moderate one on reversible cleavage/formation of O-O bonds. This work demonstrates that the reaction pathways of Li-O(2)batteries could be modulated by introducing an appropriate soluble catalyst, which is another powerful choice to construct better Li-O(2)batteries.									15	1	0	0	1	0	14			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000566923200001	32745360

It is found that oxygen nanobubbles are evolved at negative potential due to the disproportion reaction of superoxide originated from the reduced dissolved oxygen, suggesting that graphene acts as a superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimic. SPRM reveals that the catalytic sites distribute at the edge and the bulk of graphene. Atomic force microscopy suggests that the active sites for bubble evolution in the bulk of graphene are located at internal edge originated from the holes in the graphene rather than the metal oxide residues remained on the graphene sheet. The metal oxide nanoparticles on the graphene sheet are not the direct active sites but also play important roles in promoting the catalysis by increasing the superoxide concentration through an electrocatalyzed Fenton reaction. This work also presents the first experimental evidence that the catalysis of graphene is generated from the edge effect in an in operando manner. The SPRM represents a universal tool to reveal the catalytic mechanism at microscale, and it is hoped to discover more exciting reactions on nanomaterials due to its label free feature, high sensitivity, and versatility to most of materials.

Iridium (Ir)-based electrocatalysts show promise because of the inherent redox property. Considering the abundance and expensive cost of such noble metal, significant efforts have been made to rationally improve the electrochemical performance of Ir-based electrocatalysts during these years from the viewpoints of structural design and kinetic analysis. Most of the reports may aim to achieve high Ir atomic utilization with more exposed active sites, and both high electrochemical activity and durable stability are expected. In this case, Ir-based single atoms, nanostructures, and composites are reported with various electrocatalytic applications of water splitting (involving hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reaction) and other electrocatalytic oxidation reactions (involving hydrogen oxidation reaction, methanol oxidation reaction, ammonia oxidation reaction, and formic acid oxidation reaction) as well as other electrocatalytic reduction reactions (involving oxygen reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, and nitrogen reduction reaction). These works deserve to be discussed and this review article comprehensively summarized the most significant reports. We analyzed Ir-based electrocatalysts from the viewpoints of synthesis, structure, electrochemical property, and reaction mechanism. The challenges and outlooks in the future were also provided from the aspects of fundamental studies and industrial applications, which may attract more attention and provide new insight into the design of advanced Ir-based electrocatalysts with high performance.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2567-3173		WOS:000741664500001

Nanosheet-constructed hollow structures can efficiently promote the electrocatalystic activity, mainly because of their largely exposed active sites. Herein, hierarchical Co9S8 hollow microplates with nanosheet building units are fabricated via sulfurization and subsequent calcination of preformed Co-glycolate microplates. Benefiting from the advantages of a hollow structure, nanosheet units and high Co3+ content, Co9S8 hollow microplates exhibit remarkable catalytic property for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with low overpotential of 278 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 53 mV dec(-1), and satisfied stability. This construction method of Co9S8 hierarchical hollow microplates composed of a nanosheet structure is an effective tactic for promoting OER performance of water splitting electrocatalysts.									108	8	0	0	7	0	108			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000398764100035	28290657

However, the poor conductivity and sluggish reaction kinetic as well as the deficiency of electrochemically active sites hinder the practical application of FexSy. Herein, we design Fe7S8 porous nanoparticles with surface phosphate ions and enriched sulfurvacancies (P-Fe7S8), which is reported as a new high-specific-capacity material for asymmetric supercapacitor. Benefiting from the merits of substantially improved electrical conductivity and increased active sites, the optimized P-Fe7S8 negative electrode delivers ultra-high specific capacitance of 804.7F/g at 0.4 mA. Moreover, the assembled NiS//P-Fe7S8 ASC presents an impressive specific capacitance of 335.9F/g at 1.2 A/g, a high energy density of 134.8 Wh/kg at a power density of 1042.1 W/kg, and great flexibility under different bending angles.

In this study, a hierarchical hollow hydrangea-like CoRu/Co superstructure is constructed through a self-templating method by morphology-controlled pyrolysis of flower-like Ru-doped Co-based layered double hydroxides (LDH). The anchoring of Ru into Co-LDH is the key to the formation of well-defined hydrangea-like three-dimensional superstructure composed of CoRu/Co. The optimized CoRu/Co-M-350 with a low Ru loading of 3.0 wt% exhibits excellent catalytic performances in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with low overpotential (eta(10)=192 mV) and excellent stability for 100 h at 100 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media, outperforming the benchmark RuO2 and most reported electrocatalysts. The superior morphology and structural features of CoRu/Co-M-350 provide not only abundant accessible surface sites but also fast mass and electron transfer, thereby promoting OER catalysis. The present study provides a new synthetic route for preparing highly active OER electrocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000686508800001	34323014

As a half-reaction of electricity-driven water splitting, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the major bottleneck due to the sluggish kinetics of this four-electron transfer reaction. Developing low-cost and robust OER catalysts is critical to solving this efficiency problem in water splitting. The catalyst design has to be built based on the fundamental understanding of the OER mechanism and the origin of the reaction overpotential. In this article, we summarize the recent progress in understanding OER mechanisms, which include the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and lattice-oxygen-mediated mechanism (LOM) from both theoretical and experimental aspects. We start with the discussion on the AEM and its linked scaling relations among various reaction intermediates. The strategies to reduce overpotential based on the AEM and its derived descriptors are then introduced. To further reduce the OER overpotential, it is necessary to break the scaling relation of HOO* and HO* intermediates in conventional AEM to go beyond the activity limitation of the volcano relationship. Strategies such as stabilization of HOO*, proton acceptor functionality, and switching the OER pathway to LOM are discussed. The remaining questions on the OER and related perspectives are also presented at the end.									656	36	0	0	32	0	660			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000524531600003	32133479

Due to the existence of many such SAC systems, a general understanding of the trend and designing principle is necessary to discover an optimal SAC system. In this work, by using density functional theory (DFT), we investigated a series of late single transition metals (TM = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Pd) anchored on various N doped graphenes (xN-TM, x = 1-4) as electrocatalysts for both the HER and OER. Solvent effects were taken into account using an implicit continuum model. Our results reveal that the catalytic activity of SACs is determined by the local coordination number of N and TM in the catalysts. Among the considered catalysts, a low-coordinated Co site, i.e. a triple-coordinated Co, exhibits a high catalytic activity toward the HER with a calculated hydrogen adsorption free energy of -0.01 eV, whereas a high-coordinated Co center, i.e. a quadruple-coordinated Co is a promising candidate for the OER with a low computed overpotential of -0.39 V, which are comparable to those of noble metal catalysts, indicating superior HER and OER performance of N-Co co-doped graphenes. The results shed light on the potential applications of TM and N co-doped graphenes as efficient single-atom bifunctional catalysts for water splitting, thereby functioning as promising candidates for hydrogen/oxygen production.									86	6	0	0	3	0	87			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000459584900017	30672565

Therefore, it is necessary to design an innovative approach to enhance the degree of phosphidation in the material using crystal defects. Here, oxygen-vacancy iron oxide/iron foam (Ov-Fe2O3/IF) was firstly prepared by generating oxygen vacancy in situ in an iron foam through heating in vacuum conditions. Subsequently, FeP/IF was formed by phosphating Ov-Fe2O3/IF. Under the effects of oxygen vacancies, oxygen-vacancy iron oxide could be completely phosphatized to produce more active sites on the surface of the material. This, in turn, could result in a catalyst with exceptional hydrogen evolution activity. Thus, the successful fabrication of FeP/IF demonstrated in this work provides an effective and feasible way for the preparation of other high-efficiency catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000698205100001	34506068

To summarize, anodic TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTs) were grown on Ti substrate and then active IrO2 was decorated over the regular TNTs/Ti by electrodeposition and heat treatment. The effects of the TNTs as well as the preparation conditions, such as the deposition charge of IrO2 and the calcination temperature, were discussed intensively. The TNTs provide a beneficial spatial structure for the growth of active IrO2 , which ensures the desired electrocatalytic activity and adaptability of an electrode for long-term use in the oxygen evolution reaction. The electrochemical surface structure of this novel OER anode was investigated by cyclic voltammetry studies. Both the "external" and "internal" active sites could well exert their effects when the deposition charge of IrO2 was controlled at an optimal value (500 mC), and a high porosity was obtained in this case, which is most conducive to proton exchange. In addition, the calcination temperature also played an important role in the electrode performance because the nanostructure of the TNTs are destroyed at high temperatures.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1452-3981			WOS:000788060200006

Herein, Fe-doped CoTe was found very active for OER in water splitting reaction because of formation of the high valence state of Co species and lattice oxygen. The Fe-doping structure and surface chemical state were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; the electrocatalytic performances of oxygen evolution reaction were measured by cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. An overpotential of 300 mV was required to drive the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2), reduced by 145 mV compared with the pristine CoTe catalyst, and the performance was also superior to the commercial IrO2 catalyst and some analogues catalysts. The intrinsic activity expressed by specific activity and turnover frequency was increased by 14 and 21 times at overpotential of 320 mV. High catalytic stability, kinetics and catalytic efficiency were also found on the Fe-doped CoTe catalyst. It was also very interesting to find that the excellent catalytic performance coming from the intrinsic properties of Fe doped CoTe via bimetallic synergy, not from the Fe impurity adsorbed from the electrolyte. Once this doped structure was formed, no further activation was required. The surface structure change induced by Fe doping with the formation of Co3+ and more lattice oxygen would contribute to the improved performance. The current work presented a simple and economical approach to promoting the catalytic performance of CoTe for OER and some novel contributions were offered for design and understanding the Fe-promoted Co-based catalyst for the water oxidation reaction.

The vacuum assist and heat treatment of ABPBI/CMMT at 350 degrees C are the keys of Fe3+ addition. The characterization analysis demonstrates that added Fe3+ exists in the form of Fe-N-x bonds formed by coordination with N species of ABPBI in MMT. Owing to the existed Fe-N-x sites in 2D Fe-NG, it possesses excellent ORR performance better than 2D NG and 20 wt% Pt/C in O-2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. For OER, the performance of 2D Fe-NG is close to that of RuO2. The self-made ZAB based on 2D Fe-NG exhibits high peak power density, excellent rechargeable performance, and higher D-C cycling stability.									25	0	0	0	2	0	25			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000624521900002

Analogously, we study here whether these electrolyte species may participate in other reactions by investigating CO electrooxidation (COOR) on a gold rotating disk electrode. This model system, characterized by fast kinetics, exhibits a diffusion-limited regime, which helps in the identification of the species dictating the diffusion-limited current. Through a systematic concentration dependence study in a variety of buffers, we show that electrolyte buffering species act as oxygen donor shuttles in COOR, lowering the reaction overpotential. A similar correlation between electrolyte and electrocatalytic activity was observed for COOR on a different electrode material (Pt). Probing the electrode-electrolyte interface by attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and modelling the surface speciation to include the effect of the solution reactions, we propose that the buffer conjugated base generates the oxygen donor (i.e. OH-) through its acid-base reaction with water.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000730279900001	34909813

Here, we have introduced a new semiconducting porous zinc-thiolate framework via successful stitching of an "N" donor linker with a triazine-based tristhiolate secondary building unit in the overall architecture. The introduction of both linker and tristhiolate ligand synergistically modifies the architecture by making it a rigid, crystalline, three-dimensional, thermally stable, and porous framework. Our novel zinc-thiolate framework is used as an n-type semiconductor as revealed from the solid-state UV-vis DRS spectroscopic analysis, ac and dc conductivity analysis, and Mott-Schottky plot. This n-type semiconductor-based zinc-thiolate framework is utilized in the photoelectrochemical water oxidation reaction. It displayed a very high efficiency for a visible-light-driven oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in a KOH medium using standard Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. The superiority of this material was further revealed from the low onset potential (0.822 mV vs RHE), high photocurrent density (0.204 mA cm(-2)), good stability, and high O-2 evolution rate (77 smol g(-1) of oxygen evolution within 2 h), and a good efficiency (ABPE 0.42%, IPCE 29.6% and APCE 34.5%). Furthermore, the porosity in the overall framework seems to be a blessing to the photoelectrochemical performance due to better mass diffusion of the electrolyte. A detailed mechanism for the OER reaction was analyzed through density functional theory analysis suggesting the potential future of this Zn-thiolate framework for achieving a high efficiency in the sustainable water oxidation reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000841499000001	35960025

Here, we design a porous nanosheet array catalyst of spherical Co3S4 and Ni-Fe sulfide nanosheets grown vertically on FeNi3 foam (NiFeCoSx@FeNi3) with excellent catalytic activity and stability in alkaline solutions. In 1.0 M KOH solution, the current densities of the HER and OER can reach 10 mA cm(-2) with minimum overpotentials of 88 mV and 210 mV, respectively. In 1.0 M KOH and 0.33 M urea solutions, NiFeCoSx@FeNi3 needs only 1.42 V to provide a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The significantly improved catalytic activity should be attributed to the synergistic interaction among the three elements of Ni, Fe and Co as well as the hierarchical porous nanosheet array structure. This work demonstrates that a novel and efficient bifunctional trimetallic catalyst can be rationally designed by controlling the composition and ratio of the elements and the structure.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000755932200001

Herein, a noble metal-free bifunctional electrocatalyst was synthesized by a facile pyrolysis method using sucrose, urea, Co(NO3)(2) and sulfur powder as raw materials. During the fabrication process, Co, S co-doped graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was first produced, and then this in-situ-formed template further induced the generation of a Co, N, S tri-doped graphene coupled with Co nanoparticles (NPs) in the following pyrolysis process. The effect of pyrolysis temperature (700, 800, and 900 degrees C) on the physical properties and electrochemical performances of the final product was studied. Thanks to the increased number of graphene layer encapsulated Co NPs, higher graphitization degree of carbon matrix and the existence of hierarchical macro/meso pores, the composite electrocatalyst prepared under 900 degrees C presented the best activity for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with outstanding long-term durability.

The study has been carried out by solving the system of kinetic equations and a heat balance equation, involving component concentration and temperature data available from the literature. The key role in heat evolution and in the propagation of the steady-state combustion wave is played by the set of reactions that lead to reaction chain branching. The contribution from the hydrogen atom recombination reaction to the overall heat evolution does not exceed 7% even for rich mixtures and cannot ensure flame propagation without contributions from other exothermic reactions.

The hybridization of MWCNT and rGO with CoFe-LDH endows the obtained nanocomposite both hierarchical porous structure and enhanced conductivity, which significantly facilitate the mass transport and charge transfer efficiency for OER and ORR. CoFe-LDH/MWCNT/rGO displayed efficient OER activity in 1.0 M KOH with a low onset overpotential of 330 mV and an overpotential of 430 mV to reach the 10 mA/cm(2) current density. The CoFe-LDH/MWCNT/ rGO also presents excellent ORR catalytic activity with onset potential of 708 mV vs. RHE in 0.1 M KOH with a 4e-route selectivity. The excellent bifunctional catalytic activity of the CoFe-LDH/MWCNT/rGO for OER and ORR could be attributed to the synergistic effects of MWCNT, rGO and CoFe-LDH. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

HER activities of several low-cost electrocatalysts like Mo2C, MoS2, CoSe2 and NiSe2 have been studied in sodium phosphate buffer solution of pH 5. An optimal buffer concentration of 1.75 M was observed for the electrocatalysts. Compared to un-buffered electrolyte, a reduction of about 100 mV in the onset overpotential has been achieved. The electrocatalysts are highly oxygen tolerant with more than 90% HER selectivities. Furthermore, electrochemical surface area of Mo2C was evaluated by capacitance and surface oxidation methods to obtain an insight on the specific adsorption of buffer electrolytes.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000411349500002

Then Ni3N nanosheet arrays on carbon cloth (Ni3N NAs/CC) were prepared through the nitridation of corresponding Ni(OH)(2) NAs/CC precursor with NH3, thus polymer binder free three dimensional self-supporting electrode was established. The structure and morphology of the composite electrode materials were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy(SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses. The results indicate that the porosity, roughness and electrochemical effective area of Ni3N NAs/CC electrode surface are increased. The activities for the oxygen evolution reaction(OER) of the Ni3N NAs/CC were explained by recording linear scanning voltammograms and Tafel plots, the results indicate that the activity for OER is effectively increased and the over-potential for oxygen evolution could be lowered by approximately 280 mV.

With the increase of Sr content, the crystal structure of samples changes from perovskite to spinel phase that promote both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) property. As a cathode catalyst for Li-O-2 battery, LaSrNiO nanoparticles show a capacity performance of 9000 mAh.g(-1) and significantly enhanced cyclability. The improved battery performance with Sr-doped nanoparticles can be ascribed to the high surface area of Sr-doped LaSrNiO nanoparticles combined with mixed spinel and perovskite phased structure which facilitate specific capacity and OER performance obviously.

Hierarchical porous structure constituted by nanotubes and nanobulks with high specific surface area and encapsulated FeCo alloy nanoparticles is successfully prepared via the hybrid of Fe(II)-doped ZIF-8 (FeZIF) and cobalt (III) acetylacetonate (Co(acac)(3)), which is greatly redound to mass transfer and electron transport. Interestingly, Co(acac)(3) plays dual-roles during preparation process, which not only generates new metal species but improves porous structure. Moreover, FeZIF acts as a self-sacrificing template and iron source. Owing to the coaction of the unique porous structure, bimetal-N active sites and FeCo alloy, the resultant catalyst carbonized at 850 degrees C exhibits a prominent ORR activity with a positive half-wave potential of 0.864 V (vs the reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE), and a low operating potential of 1.675 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER in alkaline media. The potential gap (Delta E) of overall oxygen electrode is 0.81 V, which surpass that of numerous non-noble metal-based catalysts reported to date, indicating a promising bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst.									21	1	0	0	2	0	21			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000471996400059

Herein, ultrathin rhodium-doped nickel iron layered double hydroxide nanosheets are successfully synthesized, which exhibit outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and OER performance, and advanced overall water splitting. More impressively, the remarkable mass activity of 960 mA mg(-1) at 1.55 V (1.7 times larger than NiFe-LDH) for urea electro-oxidation reaction (UOR) shows the great potential to surmount the sluggish OER for overall water splitting. A urine-mediated electrolysis cell is subsequently configured, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a potential of 1.35 V, which is 105 mV lower than that of ureafree counterpart. The enhanced catalytic activity and cell performance are attributed to the introduction of Rh into NiFe-LDH matrix by changing the electronic structure, allowing optimization of the adsorbed species, as confirmed by experimental measurements and computational analyses.									133	3	0	0	5	0	134			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000664801300005

Due to their conductivity, durability and long-term stability, carbonaceous containing hybrid materials are used as promising electrodes for total water splitting. Herein, the design of metal-phosphide (Cu3P) with graphitic carbon-nitride (g-C3N4) nanocomposite on 3D-graphene is reported, a new model electrocatalyst that in turn, render superior electrocatalytic performance with long-term stability. The excellent electrocatalytic performance is analyzed in terms of overpotentials of 67 mV and 255 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) with a small Tafel slope of 45 and 40 mV/dec for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. The overall water splitting performance has been tested in 1 M KOH electrolyte, and the catalyst exhibits a very low cell voltage of 1.54 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) with impressive stability of at least 35 hours with no loss of potential.

The solid formed during the oxygen-evolution reaction is investigated by scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, oxygen meter, UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and oxygen meter coupled to electronic spectroscopy. It is proposed that an iridium-oxide-based catalyst is at least one of the candidates of the true catalyst for the OER in the presence of CAN andcomplex 1. The catalyst contained Ir, Ce, C, N, and O. Thus, the candidate for the oxygen-evolving catalyst may not be a simple iridium oxide, as it is usually discussed in the literature. Electronic spectra ofcomplex 1and many previously reported iridium complexes in the presence of CAN, show peaks at 500-750 nm. It is hypothesized that a candidate for the oxygen-evolving catalyst for many Ir complexes is similar, and is an iridium oxide-based compound.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000571972400037

Rational coupling transition metal with porous heteroatom-doped carbon is extensively investigated as an efficient strategy to achieve high performance ORR/OER nonprecious metal electocatalysts. In this study, a FeNi alloy coated with N-doped carbon material (namely FeNi/NC) was designed by using triblock copolymer Pluronic F127 as a surfactant co-assembly with g-C3N4. This strategy enabled FeNi/NC possessing a high BET surface area in terms of three-dimensional hierarchical porous structure together with abundant defect sites. The optimized FeNi/NC catalyst displays an excellent oxygen electrode electro-catalytic activity with a potential gap Delta E of 0.77 V in alkaline media which substantially outperformed benchmark Pt/C + RuO2 (Delta E = 0.80 V). Furthermore, it shows almost no decay after long-time cycling tests for ORR/OER. The excellent catalytic performance along with the low cost for FeNi/NC catalyst makes it possible to commercialize the renewable energy devices. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we report a nickel foam-based electrode coated with NiCoV-LDH and NiCo-LDH nanosheets (denoted as NiCo-LDH@NiCoV-LDH/NF) by a two-step method for effi-cient water splitting performance. The NiCo-LDH@NiCoV-LDH/NF with unique nanosheet-on-nanosheet construction can enlarge the electrochemical active specific surface area greatly, and thus accelerate the charge transfer of electrocatalytic reactions. Besides, the doping of vanadium could also improve the OER performance. The electrode only requires a low overpotential for OER (260 mV at 100 mA cm-2), and HER (80 mV at 10 mA cm-2) reactions in 1.0 mol/L KOH solution at room temperature.

The development of novel catalysts could benefit from the achievement of a complete understanding of the reaction mechanism on iridium oxide (IrO2), an active catalyst material that is, however, too scarce for large-scale applications. Considerable insight has already been provided by operando X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) experiments, which paved the way towards an atomistic description of the catalyst's evolution in a working environment. We combine here first-principles simulations augmented with a continuum description of the solvent and electrolyte to investigate the electrochemical stability of various IrO2 interfaces and to predict the XANES cross-section for selected terminations under realistic conditions of applied potential. The comparison of computed O K-edge XANES spectra to corresponding experiments supports the formation of electron-deficient surface oxygen species in the OER-relevant voltage regime. Furthermore, surface hydroxyl groups that are found to be stable up to similar to 1 V are suggested to be progressively oxidized at larger potentials, giving rise to a shift in the Ir L-3-edge cross-section that qualitatively agrees with measurements.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000537251100037	32369048

Petroleum Processing Section				36	6			1129	1139	1001-8719(2020)36:6<1129:BFYXOM>2.0.TX;2-1					2020	2020	Evolution and distribution of gaseous and solid sulfur during the chemical looping combustion under partial oxygen uncoupling(CLPOU)of Liuzhi coal with CuFe_2O_4oxygen carrier were studied in the high-temperature fixed bed reactor,and effects of reaction temperature,oxygen carrier added amount and CO_2atmosphere on sulfur migration and transformation were further investigated.The results show that in the temperature programmed experiment as well as the isothermal experiment,the identifiable gaseous sulfur at the outlet is only SO_2,while the solid sulfur is mainly determined as Cu_2S.Moreover,increase of reaction temperature and addition of oxygen carrier promote the oxidation of sulfur in coal,which leads to the release of more gaseous SO_2;while the CO_2atmosphere inhibits the generation of SO_2.Due to the high reactivity of the combined oxygen carrier and the excellent sulfur fixation characteristics of Cu-based oxides,the CuFe_2O_4 oxygen carrier is expected to achieve in-situ simultaneous decarbonization and desulfurization in the process of coal-fueled chemical looping combustion.			在实验室高温固定床反应器上,以富含黄铁矿硫的六枝煤为燃料,研究其与CuFe_2O_4复合载氧体在部分氧解耦化学链燃烧(CLPOU)过程中气、固相硫的演化及分布,并进一步考察反应温度、载氧体过量系数及CO_2反应气氛对硫迁移转化的影响。结果表明,无论在程序升温实验或等温实验中,反应器出口气相硫仅为SO_2,而固相硫组分以Cu_2S为主。提高反应温度和载氧体过量系数会促进煤中硫的氧化,导致更多气相SO_2的释放;而CO_2反应气氛则在一定程度上抑制SO_2的产生。鉴于CuFe_2O_4复合载氧体的高反应活性和Cu基氧化物的良好固硫特性, CuFe_2O_4载氧体有望实现煤化学链燃烧过程中碳、硫组分的协同在线控制。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1001-8719			CSCD:6855452

The obtained Pt and polyoxometalate (POM)-loaded COF complex (POM-Pt@COF-TB) exhibited excellent oxidation of methane. In addition, the resultant Co/Fe-based COF composites achieved great performance in an electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Compared with Co-modified COFs (Co@COF-TB), the optimized bimetallic modified COF composites (Co0.75Fe0.25@COF-TB) exhibited great performance for electrocatalytic OER activity, showing a lower overpotential of 331 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, Co0.75Fe0.25@COF-TB also possessed a great turnover frequency (TOF) value (0.119 s(-1)) at the overpotential of 330 mV, which exhibited high efficiency in the utilization of metal atoms and was better than that of many reported COF-based OER electrocatalysts. This work provides a new perspective for the future coordination of COFs with bimetallic or polymetallic ions, and broadens the application of COFs in methane conversion and electrocatalytic oxygen evolution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1420-3049		WOS:000845361100001	36014434

The slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involved in O-H bond breaking and attendant O=O bond formation has restricted the efficiency of PEC water splitting. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that the Eu2O3 can work as OER catalyst to significantly promote the performance of PEC water splitting. Because of its surface valance transition, the Eu2O3/ZnO shows an obvious water oxidation peak at 1.90 V vs. RHE, with a cathodic shift of around 200 mV to that of ZnO. The Eu2O3/ZnO can also yield a current density of 3.5 times larger than that of ZnO. Furthermore, similar enhancements can be also observed for the TiO2 and BiVO4, confirming the Eu2O3 is a general and efficient OER catalyst for improving the PEC performance. Such OER catalyst of Eu2O3 may bring new opportunities for the development of PEC cells with superior performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, the design and fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical earth-abundant transition bimetallic phosphide arrays constructed by one-dimensional tubular array that was derived from assembling two-dimensional nanosheet framework has been reported by tailoring the Co/Ni ratio and tunable morphologies, and zero-dimensional (0D) graphene dots were embedded on Co-Ni phosphide matrix to construct 0D/2D tubular array as a highly efficient electrode in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). On the basis of advanced merits, such as the high surface-active sites, well-dispersed graphene dots, and enhanced electron transfer capacity as well as the confinement effect of the graphene dots on the nanosheets, the integrated GDs/Co0.8Ni0.2P tubular arrays as anode and cathode exhibit excellent OER and HER performance. By use of GDs/Co0.8Ni0.2 arrays in the two-electrode setup of the device, a remarkable electrocatalytic performance for full water splitting has been achieved with a high current density of 10 mA cm-2 at 1.54 V and outstanding long-term operation stability in an alkaline environment, indicating a promising system based on nonprecious-metal electrocatalysts toward potential practical devices of overall water splitting.									42	3	0	0	0	0	42			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000406646300025	28672106

Iron/titania electrodeposited composites exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic activity towards hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) in an alkaline solution. The electrocatalytic properties of Fe/TiO2 composites towards the HER were studied by means of voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and chronoamperometry methods. An increase in TiO2 content in iron matrix resulted in an increase in the electrocatalytic activity. The kinetic parameters were calculated on the basis of Tafel plots and EIS measurements and the possible mechanisms of the HER and OER were considered. The hydrogen evolution reaction on Fe/TiO2 electrodes obeyed Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. It was concluded that the increase in the rate of the HER and OER on Fe/TiO2 composite electrodes may be associated with the emergence of the redox couples on the electrode surface and the growth of the concentration of the surface active sites. The Fe/TiO2 electrocatalysts showed a good catalytic stability in the HER and OER in 1 M NaOH solution. Copyright (C) 2016, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Developing the efficient electrocatalysts with less expense and achieving the better electrocatalytic behavior for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is very essential for extensive commercialization of fuel cells, water electrolyzers and metal air batteries. In the same pursuit, herein, we report a bifunctional coral-like NiCo2O4 nanostructure supported on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets, which was prepared by a facile, controlled hydrothermal reaction protocol. The structural, morphological and electrochemical characterizations have been carried out to explore the properties of this nanocomposite. The unique morphology, large electroactive surface area and the synergistic effect of the metal ions on the electrocatalytic activity makes this material a suitable candidate for electrochemical water splitting. The low onset potential, high current density, lower Tafel slope and long-term stability in both HER and OER has been shown by rGO-NiCo2O4 coral like nanostructure, which reveals the high catalytic activity of this material, underlying the finding and importance of current work.

The resulting Co-N-C/ND exhibits excellent catalytic activities for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. The average electron transfer number of ORR on the Co-N-C/ND is 3.82 between -0.4 and -0.7 V (vs. Hg/HgO), indicating a near four-electron transfer mechanism for ORR. Moreover, the catalytic activity of the Co-N-C/ND for ORR is comparable to the 20 wt% Pt reference catalyst supported on carbon black. The OER onset potential on the Co-N-C/ND is 0.43 V (vs. Hg/HgO) and the current density at 0.7 V is 3.19 mA cm(-2), demonstrating excellent catalytic activity for OER. In comparison to the Co-N-C derived from carbon black, the Co-N-C/ND exhibits better durability. The superior electrocatalytic performance of the Co-N-C/ND could be attributed to the synergistic effect of the Co-N moieties in the carbon shell and the high stability could be ascribed to the ND core.

This paper reports the development of a novel bifunctional perovskite, La0.4Sr0.6Co0.7Fe0.2Nb0.1O3-delta (LSCFN). The crystal structure, morphology, adsorption, valence, and oxygen catalytic activity of LSCFN were systematically studied. In addition, an investigation of the influence of the synthetic method on the oxygen catalytic activity was performed. Sol-gel and solid-phase methods were applied for the synthesis of LSCFN, and the resulting perovskites were denoted as LSCFN-SG and LSCFN-SP, respectively. The catalyst LSCFN-SG exhibited excellent bifunctional catalytic activity, with a low overpotential (360 mV) and superior stability in the OER. Subsequently, LSCFN-SG was used as the cathode catalyst in an aluminum-air battery and exhibited a high power density. The results of this study indicate that LSCFN-SG is a promising bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for metal-air batteries. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here we report a robust oxygen-evolving electrocatalyst consisting of ferrous metaphosphate on self-supported conductive nickel foam that is commercially available in large scale. We find that this catalyst, which may be associated with the in situ generated nickel-iron oxide/hydroxide and iron oxyhydroxide catalysts at the surface, yields current densities of 10 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of 177 mV, 500 mA/cm(2) at only 265 mV, and 1,705 mA/cm(2) at 300 mV, with high durability in alkaline electrolyte of 1 M KOH even after 10,000 cycles, representing activity enhancement by a factor of 49 in boosting water oxidation at 300 mV relative to the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst.									231	9	0	0	14	0	232			0027-8424			WOS:000402296700039	28507120

This work demonstrates that both the intrinsic activity and the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the oxide-carbon composites are key factors determining the overall catalytic activity. Here, we revisit the possible use of mesocarbon microbeads (MCMBs) as a support to improve the bifunctional activity of NiCo2O4 (NCO). Pre-treatments including oxidation and expansion of MCMB have been applied to obtain two types of modified MCMBs. The abundant functional groups on the oxidized MCMB (OMCMB) provide strong interaction between oxide and carbon, although a relatively low electrical conductivity is obtained. Compared to OMCMB, the expanded MCMB (EMCMB) with less functional groups shows a much larger surface area and presumably higher conductivity. The three-electrode tests reveal that the composite supported by OMCMB-3h (i.e., 3-h oxidation treatment) has a moderate intrinsic activity of the OER and the highest ECSA, leading to the enhanced bifunctional activities. The charge-discharge test of a rechargeable zinc-air battery at various current densities shows the cycling stability of NCO/OMCMB-3h at 150 mA cm(-2), which also can be cycled at 15 mA cm(-2) for 60 h without obvious decay.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000754054600001

We report a facile synthesis of FeCo2O4@carbon dots (CDs) nanoflowers supported on nickel foam through a hydrothermal technique in the absence of organic solvents and an inert environment. The synthesized material with a judicious choice of CDs shows superior performance in hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) compared to the FeCo(2)O(4)electrode alone in alkaline media. For HER, the overpotential of 205 mV was able to produce current densities of up to 10 mA cm(-2), whereas an overpotential of 393 mV was needed to obtain a current density of up to 50 mA cm(-2)for OER. The synergistic effect between CDs and FeCo(2)O(4)accounts for the excellent electrocatalytic activity, since CDs offer exposed active sites and subsequently promote the electrochemical reaction by enhancing the electron transfer processes. Hence, this procedure offers an effective approach for constructing metal oxide-integrated CDs as a catalytic support system to improve the performance of electrochemical water splitting.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12				1996-1944		WOS:000558200300001	32668661

Herein, we report that such electrocatalysts can be easily prepared by pyrolyzing a precursor composed of nickel and iron salts with urea under inert atmospheres without any post-treatments. The obtained products are composed of metallic nickel-iron alloy nanoparticles either encapsulated in or dispersed on nitrogen-doped bamboo-like carbon nanotubes (CNTs). This simple synthesis route could simultaneously realize nanostructuring, doping, and hybridizing with nanocarbon, which have been demonstrated as efficient strategies to optimize the catalytic activity of an electrocatalyst. The in situ formed hybrid catalysts exhibit good catalytic performances for both OER and HER under alkaline conditions, and the doping content of iron significantly affects the activities. When the best electrocatalyst is loaded on nickel foam with a loading of 2 mg cm(-2), a symmetric two-electrode cell can execute overall water splitting at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with only 1.58 V and shows negligible degradation after 24 h of operation. The excellent electrocatalytic activity and facile preparation method enable this hybrid electrocatalyst to be a promising candidate for future large-scale applications in water splitting.									253	9	0	0	6	0	255			2155-5435			WOS:000369774900010

Heteroatom-doped carbon materials are promising metal-free electrocatalysts to improve the conversion efficiency of these devices. To optimize the nanostructures of such carbon-based catalysts, herein, we reported an effective template method to synthesize N doped carbon nanotubes by using polydopamine as a precursor. The use of the ZnO nanowire not only serves as a self-sacrificial template to direct the formation of the nanotube, but also greatly extends the porosity of the carbon nanotube. Moreover, the polydopamine precursor also leads to effective N doping. An optimized sample, NCNT-900, shows high ORR performance comparable with that of Pt/C as well as good HER performance in both alkaline and acid media, making it one of the most effective carbon-based HER catalysts. This strategy offers an opportunity to synthesize catalysts with higher activity by rational design of a carbon precursor with higher N content or multi-heteroatom co-doping.[GRAPHICS].									11	1	0	0	1	0	12			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000458163500013

The cost of H-2 is estimated to be reduced to US$1 per kg.Acidic oxygen evolution reaction is crucial for practical proton exchange membrane water splitting electrolysers, which have been hindered by the high catalytic overpotential and high loading of noble metal catalysts. Here we present a torsion-strained Ta0.1Tm0.1Ir0.8O2-delta nanocatalyst with numerous grain boundaries that exhibit a low overpotential of 198 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) towards oxygen evolution reaction in 0.5 M H2SO4. Microstructural analyses, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the synergistic effects between grain boundaries that result in torsion-strained Ir-O bonds and the doping induced ligand effect collectively tune the adsorption energy of oxygen intermediates, thus enhancing the catalytic activity. A proton exchange membrane electrolyser using a Ta0.1Tm0.1Ir0.8O2-delta nanocatalyst with a low mass loading of 0.2 mg cm(-2) can operate stably at 1.5 A cm(-)(2) for 500 hours with an estimated cost of US$1 per kilogram of H-2, which is much lower than the target (US$2 per kg of H-2) set by the US Department of Energy.									32	0	0	0	1	0	32			1748-3387	1748-3395		WOS:000710873000001	34697492

Herein, bamboo-shaped N-doped carbon nanotubes (hollow BS-NCNTs as shells) are self-generated to in situ wrap the Co/CoOx schottky junctions (cores) to obtain the Co/CoOx@BS-NCNTs as bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts by using the Co-chelated melamine precursor. For ORR, Co/CoOx@BS-NCNTs (700 degrees C) exhibits more positive peak (0.822 V vs. RHE) and half-wave (0.842 V vs. RHE) potential than those of commercial Pt/C (10 wt%). Superior ORR activity is mainly attributed to the enriched coordination-unsaturated Co2+ (tetrahedral Co-Td(2+)) in the CoOx wrapped in the tubular structure of BS-NCNTs featuring high electrical conductivityand active N species. Moreover, the pi-pi bonds of CNTs are activated by N substitution, which provides a stunning electron capture and transmission capability for enhancing ORR activity. For OER, Co/CoOx@BS-NCNTs (700 degrees C) obtains a smaller potential (1.590 V vs. RHE) than that of RuO2/C at 10 mA cm(-2). The outstanding OER activity and durability of Co/CoOx@BS-NCNTs (700 degrees C) originates from strong interactions between C-skeleton and Co species, and efficient Co3+/Co4+ (Co4+OOH as active sites) transition protected by the externally-grown CNTs. Furthermore, abundant oxygen vacancies on CoOx surface can facilitate the adsorption of OH-/or OER-related intermediates to improve OER activity. Therefore, this study provides a promising strategy to develop NCNTs-wrapped Co species with high catalytic activity and stability for energy conversion. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Currently, the large-scale application of ZABs is hampered by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which underpin battery discharging and charging processes, respectively. In recent years, metal single-atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as promising candidates for driving oxygen electrocatalysis in ZABs, offering both high electrocatalytic activity and high metal atom utilization through unique metal coordination environments (typically porphyrin-like MNx species on N-doped carbon supports). Herein, recent breakthroughs in the design of SACs for ORR and OER electrocatalysis are summarized, with a general view towards improving ZAB performance. This Review begins by introducing the operating principles of ZABs and the reaction mechanisms of the ORR and the OER on the air electrode, after which the various types of SAC-based materials developed to date for oxygen electrocatalysis and ZABs are discussed. Special emphasis is placed on the relationships between the structure of the SAC active site and electrocatalytic performance. Finally, challenges and opportunities for SACs in practical ZABs are explored.									88	6	0	0	3	0	88			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000588006200001

Furthermore, the selective electro-catalytic mechanism of oxygen evolution and chlorine depression was discussed. The results show that the mesh-like nanostructure Mn-Mo-Ce oxide anode with little cerium doped is obtained, and the oxygen evolution efficiency for the anode in the seawater is 99. 51%, which means a high efficiency for the selective electro-catalytic for the oxygen evolution. Due to the structural characteristics of gamma-MnO2, the OH- ion is preferentially absorbed, while Cl(- )absorption is depressed. OH- accomplishes the oxygen evolution process during the valence transition electrocatalysis of Mn4(+)/Mn3(+), completing the selective electro-catalysis process. Ce doping greatly increases the reaction activity, and promotes the absorption and discharge; the rising interplanar spacing between active (100) crystalline plane promotes OH- motion and the escape of newborn O-2, so that the selective electro-catalytic property with high efficient oxygen evolution and chlorine depression is achieved from the nano morphology effect.									1	3	0	0	0	0	3			1001-4381			WOS:000463092300010

Using membrane-inlet mass spectrometry, we monitored the formation of the different O-2 isotopologues O-16(2), (OO)-O-16-O-18 and O-18(2) in such reactions simultaneously with good time resolution. From the analysis of the data, we conclude that entirely different pathways of dioxygen formation catalysis exist for reactions involving hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydrogen persulfate (HSO5-) or single-electron oxidants such as Ce-IV and [Ru-III(bipy)(3)](3+). Like the studied oxide catalysts, the active sites of manganese catalase and the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II (PSII) consist of moxido manganese or mu-oxido calcium manganese sites. The studied processes show very similar O-18-labelling behaviour to the natural enzymes and are therefore interesting model systems for in vivo oxygen formation by manganese metalloenzymes such as PSII.									84	0	0	0	18	1	84			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000290214200025	21465582

Herein, a bifunctional electrocatalyst composed of ultrasmall ruthenium nanoparticles confined within a hollow nitrogen-doped carbon spheres (Ru/HNCS) was designed and synthesized through the pyrolysis of Ru3+ coordinated polydopamine layers. The as-synthesized Ru/ HNCS with Ru content even below 0.1 wt% exhibited excellent catalytic activities towards both hydrogen production and oxygen reduction. When catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction, a low overpotential of 39 mV was sufficiently to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic media and the corresponding Tafel slope was only 30 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, Ru/HNCS also exhibited outstanding oxygen reduction reaction activity with a half-potential of 0.72 V and an onset potential of 0.83 V, as well as high stability and palmary anti-poisoning capability for methanol in basic electrolyte. This Ru/HNCS might be a promising alternative to Pt-based electrocatalysts in energy conversion and storage. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Such a procedure is simple, effective, and time-saving. The effect of iron-based raw materials and mechanochemical reaction on OER of catalysts are investigated. It shows that iron nitrate nonahydrate is the best iron resource compared to iron hydroxide and iron oxide due to amorphous iron species in catalysts for strengthening the "Fe inductive effect" and generating active Ni species with high valence. Besides, the grinding time can control the mechanochemical reaction from mixed reaction to solid reaction in the catalyst synthesis process. When the time is 30 min, the catalyst is composed with amorphous Ni(OH)(2) and the precursors of NiFe-LDH. This catalyst only needs 413 mV overpotential to reach 1 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M K-Bi (pH=9.2), which is better than precious RuO2. It is proven that the mechanochemical approach is an alternative method for synthesizing superior OER catalysts. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Most of them suffer from low intrinsic activity and poor stability, failing to meet the needs of practical applications. Here, we report an efficient and durable bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst of Fe@Fe-SAC composite (SAC stands for single atoms on carbon). A facile and ease-to-scale-up process synthesizes it. Fe single-atom and Fe nanoparticles are anchored on nitrogen-doped porous carbon, with the latter encapsulated by the graphitic shell. It exhibits appealing activity and durability in a basic electrolyte, requiring a half-wave potential of 0.805 V for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and an overpotential of only 348 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Both activities are comparable to the corresponding benchmarking electrocatalyst of Pt/C for ORR and IrO2 for OER. The superior activities are attributed to the strong electronic interaction between metal single-atom and nanoparticles. The favorable stability is ascribed to the physical encapsulation of carbon coatings on nanoparticles.

Here, we report the synthesis of mesoporous nickel oxide by the template method and its application in the title reaction. The as-prepared mesoporous NiO possesses a large surface area, uniform mesopores, and rich surface electrophilic Ni3+ and O- pecies. The overpotential of meso-NiO in alkaline medium is 132 mV at 10 mA cm(-1) and 410 mV at 50 mA cm(-1), which is much smaller than that of the other types of NiOsamples. The improvement in the OER activity can be ascribed to the synergy of the large surface area and uniform mesopores for better mass transfer and high density of Ni3+ and O- pecies favoring the nucleophilic attack by OH- to form a NiOO intermediate. The reaction process and the role of electrophilic Ni3+ and O- were discussed in detail. This results are more conducive to the electrochemical decomposition of water to produce hydrogen fuel as a clean and renewable energy.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16				2073-4344		WOS:000442517100015

Herein, a fast and facial flame-assisted strategy is developed to construct oxygen-coordinated SACs on integrated carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays with promising applications in electrocatalysis. Density functional theory calculations show that oxygen in carbon substrate imparts homogeneous sites for the efficient anchoring of metal atoms, thereby enabling SACs to disperse uniformly and firmly and thus bringing optimized activities. Moreover, the integrated CNT array with abundant oxygen-containing groups is constructed and has been used as an efficient matrix for anchoring metal atoms (CNT-O@M) via a flame-assisted method. The as-prepared CNT-O@M (M = Co and Pt as typical examples) shows excellent activities in electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction with utilization of active site as high as 75.7%, which is superior to the reported SACs. Particularly, the performance of CNT-O@M can maintain stably under various harsh conditions, showing a promising prospect in the long-time applications. The methodology and concept proposed in this work could be extended to the synthesis of a variety of integrated SACs for efficient electrocatalysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2366-9608			WOS:000724831600001	35041290

The unique hierarchical porous structure, favorable electronic structure modified by the N and P doping, as well as a variety of defect sites induced by the N and P doping into the carbon framework were identified as the main contributions to the prominent catalytic activity of the as-synthesized N, P-dually doped biochar materials. We expect this work would spur more efforts into developing advanced materials from the large scale lignocellulosic biomass wastes. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, CuPd/Pd core/shell nanoparticles with an ultrathin Pd shell (0.5 nm) are developed, which demonstrate the Pt-like bifunctional activity for HER and ORR in acid electrolytes. The overpotential at 350 mA cm(-2) for HER and the half-wave potential for ORR on the optimal CuPd/Pd core/shell NPs are 76 mV and 0.854 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively, which are comparable to that of Pt and among the best of the reported Pd-based catalysts. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the significantly enhanced HER/ORR activity on CuPd/Pd core/shell NPs with 0.5 nm Pd shell stem from the compressive strain induced downshift of d-band center for Pd (by 2.0%), which weakens the binding strength of *H and oxygenated intermediates and promotes the reaction kinetics.									22	1	0	0	1	0	23			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000640918500001

The ANC-FexNiy catalyst presents abundant catalytic sites and high intrinsic conductivity. As such, the optimized ANC-Fe1Ni2 exhibits high activity in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a Tafel slope of 39 mV dec(-1) and an overpotential of 266 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Notably, the optimized ANC-Fe1Ni2 shows an extraordinarily large mass activity of 3028 A g(FeNi)(-1) at the overpotential of 300 mV, which is similar to 24-fold of commercial RuO2 catalyst. The superior activity of these FexNiy hydroxide nanoclusters is ascribed to (i) the amorphous and distorted structure with abundant oxygen vacancies, and (ii) enhanced active site density by downsizing the ANC-FexNiy clusters. This strategy provides a novel route for enhancing OER electrocatalytic performance and highly encouraging for the future application of amorphous metal hydroxides in catalysis.

Meanwhile, three dimensional heterostructure NiFe layered-double-hydroxide (LDH)@Ni NTAs electrode materials with strong interfacial interaction are prepared on NF by coupling ultrathin NiFe LDHs with Ni NTAs by electrochemical deposition, which demonstrate an excellent catalytic performance for oxygen evolution compared with NiFe LDH. Ni NTAs/NF require an overpotential of 101 mV to force the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction because of the unique NTAs structure and the active sites for water dissociation provided by Ni2+ on the Ni NTAs surface. NiFe LDH@Ni NTAs/NF exhibit a low overpotential of 191 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction due to the reliable electron transfer from the intermediate metallic Ni NTAs to the external the NiFe LDH layer and more active sites that are exposed by highly dispersed ultrathin NiFe LDH nanosheets. The development of self-supporting NiFe LDH@Ni NTAs and Ni NTAs electrodes for efficient overall water splitting in an integrated alkaline electrolyzer is achieved a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.51 V, accompanying excellent long-term durability.									31	2	0	0	1	0	32			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000509632300059

However, realization of such electrodes is motivated by low activity and instability of the current electrocatalysts working for both water splitting and oxygen reduction. Herein, we report a series of Co3O4/graphene-based catalysts with different Co mass loadings prepared by using a facile one-step hydrothermal route. N-doped reduced graphene oxide (NRGO) was utilized as a substrate for the deposition of oxide particles. The structural properties and surface composition of the different materials were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. The effect of Co mass loading on the morphostructural properties of oxide nanoparticles and also on their electroactivity towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was addressed. This study revealed the optimum range for metal loading on the graphene substrate. Co3O4/NRGO with a Co mass loading of 30 wt.% exhibits the highest activity towards ORR and OER, with a reversibility criterion of 763 mV. This work is very helpful for the electrocatalysis community, and will allow effective catalysts to be developed for high-power metal/air battery or regenerative fuel cell systems, based on earth-abundant and scalable electro-catalysts.									14	2	0	0	0	0	15			2196-0216			WOS:000423803900011

Herein, we achieve a significant improvement in electrocatalytic activity for both the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER) by constructing a novel hierarchical PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2O5+delta (PBSC)@FeOOH catalyst. The optimized PBSC@FeOOH-20 catalyst consisted of layered perovskite PBSC nanorods and 20 nm thick amorphous FeOOH nanoflakes exhibiting an excellent electrocatalytic activity for the OER and the HER in 0.1 M KOH media, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 390 mV for the OER and 280 mV for the HER, respectively. The substantially enhanced performance is probably attributed to the hierarchical nanostructure, the good charge-transfer capability, and the strong electronic interactions of FeOOH and PBSC. Importantly, an alkaline electrolyzer-integrated PBSC@FeOOH-20 catalyst as both the anode and cathode shows a highly active overall water splitting with a low voltage of 1.638 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and high stability during continuous operation. This study provides new insights into exploring efficient bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting, and it suggests that the rational design of the oxyhydroxide/perovskite heterostructure shows great potential as a promising type of electrocatalysts.									51	4	0	0	2	0	51			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000449887600029	30360054

The oxygen evolution efficiency in 0.5 M NaCl solution at 30 degrees C On the MnO2 electrodes increases with a decrease in pH of the deposition electrolyte. The tungsten-containing electrodes show significantly higher efficiency for oxygen evolution. The tungsten addition enhances oxygen evolution and suppresses chlorine evolution, and hence 99.6% efficiency for oxygen evolution was obtained at 200 A m(-2) on the oxide with the molar ratio W6+/(Mn4+ + W6+) of 0.16. The anodically deposited manganese oxide consists of nanocrystalline gamma-MnO2. The manganese-tungsten oxides are also composed of a single orthorhombic nanocrystalline gamma MnO2-type phase, in which Mn4+ and W6+ ions are homogeneously distributed, even when cationic fraction of tungsten in the oxide is 0.16. The Tafel slopes of the MnO2 and (Mn-W)O-X electrodes for oxygen evolution are both higher than those for chlorine evolution. The MnO2 and (Mn-W)O-X electrodes anodically deposited at lower pH and the (Mn-W)O-X electrodes with higher tungsten content have smaller grain size and higher surface roughness. The surface roughening of the oxides leading to the decrease in the electrode potential under the galvanostatic condition accelerates the oxygen evolution reaction and suppresses chlorine evolution.

Here, a system based on electrodeposited Ni(OH)(2) and Co(OH)(2) containing highly distributed gold nanoparticles at less than 0.25 at% to facilitate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions is developed. The key aspect is using galvanic replacement to deposit gold on a layer of electrodeposited Co(OH)(2) prior to electrodepositing Ni(OH)(2). The fabrication of a composite system based on Co(OH)(2)-Au-Ni(OH)(2) is required for optimal activity for both the HER and OER. The composite is characterized with helium ion microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, depth profiling X-ray photoelectron microscopy, and a variety of electrochemical techniques. This material exceeds the activity of Pt for the HER at current densities greater than 40 mA cm(-2) and is stable for both reactions for prolonged periods of electrolysis. In a two-electrode configuration, current densities greater than 175 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting could be readily achieved at an applied voltage of 1.90 V in a commercially relevant electrolyte of 6 m NaOH.									48	1	0	0	0	0	48			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000448258800013

A wide electrochemical characterization in 0.1 M NaHCO3 involving anodic (carbon corrosion and oxygen evolution reaction, OER) and cathodic (CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution reaction, HER) key reactions in energy-conversion devices was performed. DEMS studies showed that the faradaic current from 1.3 to 1.6 V vs. RHE of carbons was only associated to CO2 formation by corrosion and not to OER, the stability being improved by the graphitic character of carbon. H-2 evolution was also enhanced with graphitic carbon nanofilaments, even though metal traces might positively influence their catalytic activity. By comparison of the faradaic currents and the H-2 formation signals, in the absence and presence of CO2, a high inhibition of the HER was established for all carbon electrodes due to the species adsorption from CO2 reduction.

Herein, a bifunctional hybrid electrocatalyst of Ni3ZnC0.7 nanodots in-situ grown on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (Ni3ZnC0.7/NCNIT) arrays is synthesized by a one-step template strategy with 1, 3, 5-triamino-2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene serving as carbon/nitrogen sources, ZnO nanorods as template and zinc source, and nickel foam as substrate and nickel source. Benefiting from the introduction of Ni3ZnC0.7 nanodots and nitrogen doping to the carbon nanotubes, the Ni3ZnC0.7/NCNIT-700 arrays exhibit superior hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction catalytic activity in terms of low overpotential (203 mV and 380 mV vs RHE at 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively). When the Ni3ZnC0.7/NCNIT-700 is served as both anode and cathode catalysts for overall water splitting, a potential of 1.66 V is needed to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and it also displays negligible degradation after 24 h of operation in alkaline solution. The present work not only provides an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, but also offers a new strategy to design and synthetize the bimetallic carbide.

Heteroatom doped carbon catalysts propose a promising candidate for such purposes along with the superior durability and cost-effectiveness. Unfortunately, exact identification of the catalytic site as well as the critical role of dopants is still controversial in the catalytic mechanism. Here we present bifunctional catalytic site of nitrogen pair-doped graphene nanoribbons for precisely switchable OER and ORR. Pyrazolated N-2-edges of graphene nanoribbon serve as switchable dual-functional active sites for OER/ORR with efficient activities and extraordinary durability. Theoretical calculation reveals genuine catalytic mechanism originating from the electrochemical potential-dependent molecular absorption and conversion at the atomic level dopant site. This judiciously controllable bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of dopant catalyst fundamentally addresses the interference between ORR and OER and attains highly stable rechargeable metal-air battery with long-term stability.									34	4	0	0	1	0	34			2405-8297			WOS:000586658000022

Herein, Co@CoO@Co3O4-N/C was prepared by two-step thermal treatment of Co-MOF ([Co(INA)(2)]center dot 0.5EtOH) (INA: isonicotinic acid). Firstly, Co-MOF, as precursor, was pyrolyzed at different temperatures in N-2 atmosphere to obtain Co-N/C-T (T = 700, 800, 900 degrees C) materials among which Co-N/C-800 shows remarkably high ORR activity. After oxidation treatment, Co-N/C-800 is transformed into Co@CoO@Co3O4-N/C which exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic activities for both ORR and OER. The as-obtained Co@CoO@Co3O4-N/C has more positive onset potential (-0.136 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and higher limit current density (4.9 mA cm(-2)) than Co-N/C-800 (-0.143 V vs. Ag/AgCl and 3.9 mA cm(-2)), as well as better tolerance to methanol and stability (80.0%) than those of Pt/C (63.2%) for ORR. Co@CoO@Co3O4-N/C also displays outstanding OER performances, with lower overpotential (450 mV) than that of Co-N/C-800 (492 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The excellent electro-chemical performance of Co@CoO@Co3O4-N/C can be ascribed to uniformly dispersed Co-N-x active sites, strong synergistic effects between N-doped carbon support and Co@CoO@Co3O4 as well as ordered mesoporous structure, boosting mass transfer and accelerating electrocatalytic reaction.

Herein, the CoNiFe-based sulfides are fabricated by a surface decoration on NiFe Prussian blue analogue, followed by an evaporating sulfurization process. The as-formed metal sulfides have a nanocubic morphology and show a phase-dependent OER activity in alkaline electrolyte. The optimized catalyst possesses a remarkable activity and durability towards OER, featured by a low overpotential of 288 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 72 mV dec(-1). The outstanding OER performance originates from the hierarchically porous architecture and interfacial coupling between CoS2 and (Ni,Fe)S-2 phases. Our finding provides a promising strategy to develop advanced low-cost electrocatalysts with intriguing phase structure by producing the heterojunctions via post treatments on PBA such as surface modification and evaporation sulfidization.

Focusing on this problem, we develop a flowery CoMoO3 nanoplate/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanoplate hybrid structure decorated with Ag nanoparticles (CoMoO3/rGO@Ag) to ameliorate the catalytic performance of OER. The reduced graphene oxide (rGO) wrapped outside can optimize electronic transmission and retain the structural integrity of internal flowery CoMoO3 nanoplates. Moreover, abundant ultrafine Ag nanoparticles are chosen as the auxiliary phase to cooperate with CoMoO3 and rGO phases, and such hybrid structure generates abundant heterostructure interfaces, which can offer more active sites and significantly enhance the reaction activity of the catalyst. After the incorporation of rGO and the adjustment of the Ag content, the optimized CoMoO3/rGO@Ag catalyst displays electrochemically synergistic enhancement toward OER, which shows a remarkably low overpotential (209 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and good cyclic endurance. These results effectively expound the rapid reaction kinetics and great stability of such heterostructure electrocatalyst toward water oxidation.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2574-0970		WOS:000657373800111

In this work the performance of the thermochemical processes of sewage sludge at different oxygen concentrations was investigated by thermogravimetric (TG) and Fourier transform infrared analysis (FTIR) study. The oxygen concentrations were varied systematically from 0 to 20%, representing heating process from pyrolysis to full combustion. The evolutions of surface functional groups in these processes were also investigated by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (DRIFT), which helped to understand the reaction mechanism during the thermal degradation, especially when the reaction conditions were different. The heating process was divided into four stages, dehydration (below 200 degrees C), devolatilization (200-400 degrees C), char combustion (above 400 degrees C), and secondary devolatilization (above 650 degrees C). Reaction mechanism and kinetic model was proposed based on the stages of heating process. Oxygen concentration was presented explicitly in the reactions and kinetic equations. The model was then developed for the heating processes at different oxygen concentrations, followed by fittings of kinetic parameters. Some of the parameters in the model were fixed as constants to minimize the number of variations. The fitted model agreed well with the TG curves at different oxygen concentrations and could illustrate the evolution of intermediates and products during the heating process. The developed kinetic model could be further applied for the modeling of sewage sludge pellets combustion considering oxygen diffusion process. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, high cathode overpotentials are some of the main problems during cycling. In our previous work, a catalyst combination of Ag and Co3O4 is found that reduces overpotential significantly, and is highly active and also long-term stable. In the present investigations, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy are applied to study the structure and composition of the cathode material during oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Changes of the oxidation states during cycling are responsible for an enhanced oxygen evolution reaction current density but also for losses due to a lower electronic conductivity of the electrodes. The presence and formation of a mixed oxidation state for silver oxide ((AgAgO2)-Ag-I-O-III) at high potentials is identified. In contradiction to literature, time dependent X-ray diffraction measurements evidence that this phase is not stable under dry conditions and progressively decays to Ag2O. Electrode mappings show a highly homogeneous oxidation of the electrodes during cycling and quantitative analysis of the observed phases is carried out by Rietveld analysis. Long-term material behavior completes the investigations.									23	1	0	0	3	0	23			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000362591100004

However, practical realization remains challenging. Using water electrocatalysis as a model reaction, we report an interfacial-bond-induced intermediate modulation to accelerate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by hybridizing a 2D nickel metal-organic framework (MOF) and Pt nanocrystals into a heterostructure. The design is initially verified via theoretical calculations, indicating charge relocation on newly formed Ni-O-Pt interfacial bonds for increased OH* adsorption energy together with reduced H* adsorption energy. Experimental findings confirm the formation of the Ni-O-Pt bonds, which electronically modify the heterostructure to increase electron density for Pt and the high-energy Ni 3d state for the MOF, optimizing the adsorption for H* and OH*, respectively. This hybridized material delivered HER activity of 7.92 mA mu g(-1) Pt, which is among the best reported for alkaline electrocatalysts, and an improved OER activity.									97	10	0	0	6	0	97			2451-9294			WOS:000485810000016

For the Ni-only phase, water adsorption and intercalation can significantly lower both the surface and interface energies, and even introduce "negative surface energy". Thus, water can exfoliate layers, leading to Fe ion adsorption on inner layers, as demonstrated by ab initio molecular dynamics. These single atoms have been carefully speciated (i.e., initially prepared as Fe2+ and Fe3+) and proton coupled electron transfer between the H2O-Fe and lattice oxygen ions has been observed in all ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, which is attributed to the Fe incorporation, since no proton coupled electron transfer occurs under free water conditions. Furthermore, 15 possible oxygen evolution reaction mechanisms near Fe ions show that the main active species corresponds to the Ni2+, which is reduced from Ni3+ via H transfer when a Fe2+ iron adsorbs nearby, and the overpotential can be significantly reduced to 0.23 V.									51	1	0	0	1	0	51			2155-5435			WOS:000538766900031

Here, trace level (0.11-0.18 wt %) Co-N doped graphite foam (Co-N/GF) was reported to work as a bifunctional high-performance and self-standing electrode for both HER and OER in alkaline electrolyte. The catalytic activities of Co-N/GFs with different annealing temperatures (600, 700, 800, 900, and 1000 degrees C) were carefully studied. Among them, Co-N/GF-900 exhibited the best HER activity and Co-N/GF-700 showed the best OER activity, achieving the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 165 and 313 mV, respectively. In addition, both of these electrodes exhibited long-term durability. Co-N/GF electrodes were further constructed as a catalytic cathode and anode couple (Co-N/GF-900 parallel to Co-N/GF-700) for overall water splitting, exhibiting a low cell voltage of 1.68 V and good long-term stability.

Several metal porphyrins are reported to perform catalytic WO through the central metal but [5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)porphyrinato]cobalt(II) (abbreviated as CoTMPP), which is well-known for its ability to perform oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), lacks the capacity to perform WO. Here we have successfully activated CoTMPP towards electrochemical WO by means of itsin situencapsulation inside the cavity of a versatile metal organic framework (MOF), known as zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8). The composite, thus preparedi. e., CoTMPP@ZIF-8 (abbreviated asCTMZ-8), behaves as a heterogeneous, robust, and efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at a wide pH range (from acidic to neutral). Required overpotential (eta) of 387.4 mV (neutral pH) and 562.7 mV (pH 2) and high turnover frequency (TOF) of 2.7 s(-1)(at neutral pH) make this composite (CTMZ-8) an efficient electrocatalyst for WO.

The phyto-functionalized NPs have been characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to confirm the capping of the NPs by this propanedioic organic compound which is an active anti-oxidant derivative of carboxylic acid. Elemental and morphological investigation revealed the formation of pure Mn(3)O(4)NPs with spherical aggregates of app. 500 nm at higher magnification. Synthesized nano-scaled particles have been scrutinized at electrochemical workstation to study the electrochemical behavior for water splitting studies. For this, the prepared NPs were fabricated on Ni-foam and tested for linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronoamperometry for exploration of oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions in presence of 1M KOH electrolyte. The material showed good electrochemical potential towards OER with lower Tafel value and overpotential as compared to HER.

Here, we presented an enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by introducing the piezotronics concept, i.e., piezoelectric polarization (P-pz,)-induced band engineering. In a Ni(OH)(2)-decorated ZnO photoanode system, appreciably improved photocurrent density of sulfite (SO32-) and hydroxyl (OH-) oxidation reactions were obtained by physically deflecting the photoanode. Both theoretical and experimental results suggested that the performance enhancement was a result of the piezoelectric P-pz-endowed enlargement of the built-in electric field at the ZnO/Ni(OH)(2) interface, which could drive an additional amount of photoexcited charges from ZnO toward the interface for OER. This strategy demonstrates a new route for improving the performance of inexpensive catalysts-based solar-to-fuel production.									51	3	0	0	0	0	52			1948-7185			WOS:000360953300016	26279397

The material also shows a remarkable 78-fold higher mass activity than the conventional IrO2 at 1.55 V in 0.5 M H2SO4. Structural characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that the core-shell interaction and tensile strain cause band position shift and charge redistribution.

The kinetics of the OER is generally sluggish unless precious metal-based catalysts are used. Perovskite oxides have shown promise as alternatives to these expensive materials. However, for several perovskites, including SrCoO3-delta, the rate-limiting step is proton-transfer. In this study, it is shown that such a kinetic limitation can be overcome by coupling those perovskites with MoS(2)mechanochemically. By studying composites of SrMO3-delta(M = Co, Fe, Ti) and MoS2, the role that the formed heterointerfaces play in enhancing the activity is investigated. Mechanochemically mating SrCoO(3-delta)and MoS(2)increases the mass activity toward OER by a factor of ten and led to a Tafel slope of only 37 mV dec(-1). In contrast, combining MoS(2)with SrFeO(3-delta)or SrTiO3-delta, two materials whose OER is not limited by proton-transfer, does not result in an improvement of the performance. The experimental measurements and first-principle calculations reveal that the MoS(2)at the MoS2@SrCoO(3-delta)heterointerfaces is both an electron and a proton acceptor, thereby facilitating deprotonation of the perovskite and resulting in faster OER kinetics.									23	2	0	0	2	0	22			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000577647800001

During the HER experiments, overpotentials of - 300 and - 350 mV were observed at the current density of - 10 mA cm(-2) in strong alkaline and in strong acidic media, respectively. During the OER studies performed in strong acidic solution and in neutral environment, overpotentials of 320 and 690 mV were obtained at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). These findings complement the existing scientific literature relevant to the water splitting domain. Furthermore, the visible light absorption ability of synthetic Fe2+Fe23+(PO4)(2)(OH)(2) materials was also evaluated.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1388-6150	1588-2926		WOS:000820575300001

Herein, a hybrid of cobalt nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbon nanotubes (Co@NCNT) was fabricated via economically scalable pyrolysis of a mixture of a Co-based metalorganic framework (ZIF-67) and dicyandiamide. The as-synthesized Co@NCNT hybrid was characterized by techniques of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) etc., confirming that it possessed desirable properties of high surface area, robust structure, and good conductivity. A series of electrochemical measurements demonstrated that the Co@NCNT exhibits high activity and excellent durability toward several important electrochemical reactions, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in pH-universal electrolyte, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in both acidic and alkaline media, glucose oxidation reaction (GOR), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium, mainly as a result of the synergistic effects of unique structure and high surface area of the Co nanoparticles and nitrogen dopant in the nanocomposite. A zinc-air battery with outstanding performance was set up using the Co@NCNT as cathode material, demonstrating its potential applications in energy storage and as a conversion system device.									102	6	0	0	2	0	102			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000388211700006

Herein, we explore the development of cobalt-containing polyoxometalate immobilized over the carbon nanotube fiber (CNTF) (Co4POM@CNTF) towards efficient electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). CNTF serves as an excellent electron mediator and highly conductive support, while the self-activation of the part of Co4POM through restructuring in basic media generates cobalt oxides and/or hydroxides that serve as catalytic sites for OER. A modified electrode fabricated through the drop-casting method followed by thermal treatment showed higher OER activity and enhanced stability in alkaline media. Furthermore, advanced physical characterization and electrochemical results demonstrate efficient charge transfer kinetics and high OER performance in terms of low overpotential, small Tafel slope, and good stability over an extended reaction time. The significantly high activity and stability achieved can be ascribed to the efficient electron transfer and highly electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the self-activated electrocatalyst immobilized over the highly conductive CNTF. This research is expected to pave the way for developing POM-based electrocatalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000872347200001

Herein we present a facile self-template strategy to synthesize Co3O4 mesoporous nanotubes with outstanding performances in both the electrocatalytic oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) and Li-ion battery via the thermal-oxidation-induced transformation of cheap and easily-prepared Co-Asp(cobalt-aspartic acid) nanowires. The initially formed thin layers on the precursor surfaces, oxygen-induced outward diffusion of interior precursors, the gas release of organic oxidation, and subsequent Kirkendall effect are important for the appearance of the mesoporous nanotubes. This self-template strategy of low-cost precursors is found to be a versatile method to prepare other functional mesoporous nanotubes of transition-metal oxides and chalcogenides, such as NiO, NiCo2O4, Mn5O8, CoS2 and CoSe2.									149	11	0	0	5	0	150			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000383253700049	27239778

Herein, we report a caterpillar-like nanostructure self-assembled from porous vanadium nitride nanosheets, which were uniformly decorated with ultrafine nickel nitride quantum dots. Detailed structural and chemical investigations verified that the VN substrate distorts the Ni3N lattice fringes due to strong interatomic interaction at the interface, in which case a low match heterostructure is simultaneously generated. The successful construction of Ni3N QDs chemically coupled with porous vanadium nitride (VN) nanosheets allowed realizing rapid charge transfer and mass transport. Especially, the distorted QD configuration with a modified chemical state played a vital role in enhanced oxygen electrocatalysis performance, thereby, making the material highly efficient for catalyzing oxygen reduction/evolution reactions. Featuring a small overpotential, rapid electrode kinetics, and excellent structural durability, the synthesized D-Ni3N QDs/VN was superior to most transition metal nitrides previously reported. This discovery opens a completely new avenue for elevating oxygen-involving reactions by taking advantage of structural distortion effects in hybrid nanomaterials.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000581598800031

The phase structure and the morphology of NCC nanoparticles have been investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) while the electrocatalytic activity of the samples has been studied in alkaline solution by using rotating disk electrode technique.

However, sluggish oxygen reaction kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the air-breathe cathode seriously has limited further practical applications. In this work, we synthesize a NiCo2O4 nanocrystal/MXene hybrid with strong Ni/CoF bonds. The prepared MXene-based hybrid composites show remarkable ORR and OER electrocatalytic activity, which results in the fabricated solid-state ZAB device to achieve an open-circuit voltage of 1.40 V, peak power density of 55.1 mW cm(-2), and energy efficiency of 66.1% at 1.0 mA cm(-2); to the best of our knowledge, this is the record performance among all reported flexible ZABs with MXene-based air cathodes and comparable with some noble metal catalysts. Moreover, even after cutting and suturing, our flexible solid-state ZAB devices are tailorable with high rate of performance.									41	3	0	0	2	0	41			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000579956100023	32815716

Herein, a quaternary amorphous nanocompound Ni-Fe-P-B has been synthesized by a facile, scalable co-reduction method. The Ni-Fe-P-B exhibits high electrocatalytic activity and outstanding durability for both HER and OER, delivering a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) at overpotentials of 220 and 269 mV, respectively. When loaded on carbon fiber paper (CFP) as a bifunctional catalyst, the Ni-Fe-P-B@CFP electrode requires a low cell voltage of 1.58 V to obtain 10 mAcm(-2) for overall water splitting with negligible recession over 60 h. The excellent catalytic performances of Ni-Fe-P-B mainly benefit from the metal-metalloid combined composition modulation and the unique amorphous structure. This work provides new insights into the design of robust bifunctional catalysts for water splitting, and may promote the development of multicomponent amorphous catalysts.									44	6	0	0	1	0	44			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000507367000001

However, the high price of anode electrocatalysts like RuO2 or IrO2 limits their wide application. Herein, we introduce the employment of FePx grown on C as a catalyst with high activity and low cost, containing a special nanocluster structure formed by a simple chemical reduction combined with an electroless plating method. The performance of FePx/C shows a low overpotential of 273 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 56 mV dec(-1) and a long continuous oxygen evolution for 5 h in 1.0 M potassium hydroxide. Such superior performance can be attributed to the porous structure of the iron phosphide nanoclusters. Our work not only shows excellent performance, but also provides a workable design for non-noble catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0361-5235	1543-186X		WOS:000630276900002

The synthesized product shows exceptional bifunctional activity and robust stability towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The enhanced catalytic capacity is primary attributed to the synergistic effect of PCO/Co3O4, evidenced by the experimental results and theoretical calculations. More importantly, the PCO/Co3O4 NCs assembled liquid Zn-air battery exhibits a power density of 182 mW cm-2 and a long-term operation of 185 h. When assembled into solidstate cable type battery, this newly designed catalyst also reaches a stable open circuit voltage (1.359 V) and a peak power density of 85 mW cm3.

It is one of the most pivotal aspects in the development of novel systems having high electrocatalytic performance toward overall water splitting reactions and is found to be better than universally acceptable Pt-based nanoelectrodes. The synthesis of nanohybrids shows the well-dispersed Rh NSs (similar to 50 nm) on a few layers of graphene oxide sheets. These as-synthesized nanomaterials were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measurements, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Furthermore, Rh-GO exhibits significantly improved electrochemical performance toward electrocatalytic water splitting reactions, that is, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and it shows exceptionally an ultrasmall overpotential of 2 mV for the HER, reaching a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a smaller Tafel slope 10 mV dec(-1), and the OER overpotential reaches 0.23 V at 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 27 mV dec(-1). The reduced charge transfer resistances after Rh NSs decoration on GO which lead to simultaneous enhancement in feasibility toward interfacial electron transfer, result in an increase in activity toward overall water splitting reactions (both HER and OER).									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2574-0970			WOS:000603402500065

Cobalt iron oxyhydroxides (CoFeOxHy) are among the most active OER catalysts in alkaline medium. However, the active sites of these catalysts remain unclear. Here we use operando ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), X-ray absorption, and Raman spectroscopy to reveal oxidations of both Fe and Co ions in CoFeOxHy during the OER. By analyzing samples with different Fe contents and thickness, we find that the concentration of Fe4+ species at the surface, but not the concentration of Co4+ in the bulk, scales with the catalytic activity. These results indicate an Fe4+-containing active site in CoFeOxHy.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000723741600001

In-depth understanding the role of confinement is therefore required. In this study, we simulate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on iron oxide nanoclusters under confinement of (7,7) and (8,8) armchair carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The free energies of the four proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps and the OER overpotentials are calculated. The Fe4O6 nanocluster confined in (7,7) CNT is found to be the most active for OER among the systems considered in this work. This leads to an increase in catalytic efficiency of OER compared to the hematite (110) surface, which was reported recently as an active surface towards OER. The calculated results show that the OER overpotential depends strongly on the magnetic properties of the iron oxide nanocluster. These findings are helpful for experimental design of efficient catalyst for water splitting applications.									39	0	0	0	1	1	39			1386-9477	1873-1759		WOS:000428346500001

In steady-state conditions, the evolution of oxygen varies with I according to the hyperbolic expression OEth = OEth(max)I/(L-1/2 + I) (eq i) where OEth is the theoretical oxygen evolution, OEth(max) is the maximum oxygen evolution, and L-1/2 is the light intensity giving OEth(max)/2. In this work, the mathematical derivation of this relationship was performed by using the Langmuir adsorption isotherm and assuming that the photon interaction with the chlorophyll (Chl) in the PSII reaction center is a heterogeneous reaction in which the light is represented as a stream of particles instead of an electromagnetic wave (see discussion in Turro, N. J. Modern Molecular Photochemistry; University Science Books: Mill Valley, CA, 1991). In accordance with this approximation, the Chl molecules (P680) were taken as the adsorption surfaces (or heterogeneous catalysts), and the incident (or exciting) photons as the substrate, or the reagent. Using these notions, we demonstrated that eq i (Langmuir equation) is a reliable interpretation of the photon-P680 interaction and the subsequent electron transfer from the excited state P680, i.e., P680(*), to the oxidized pheophytin (Phe), then from Phe(-) to the primary quinone Q(A). First, eq i contains specific functional and structural information that is apparent in the definition of OEth(max) as a measure of the maximal number of PSII reaction centers open for photochemistry, and L-1/2 as the equilibrium between the electron transfer from Phe(-) to Q(A) and the formation of reduced Phe in the PSII reaction center by electrons in provenance from P680(*). Second, a physiological control mechanism in eq i is proved by the observation that the magnitudes of OEth(max) and L-1/2 are affected differently by exogenous PSII stimulators of oxygen evolution (Fragata, M.; Dudekula, S. J. Phys. Chem. B 2005, 109, 14707). Finally, an unexpected new concept, implicit in eq i, is the consideration of the photon as the substrate in the photochemical reactions taking place in the PSII reaction center. We conclude that the Langmuir equation (eq i) is a novel mathematical formulation of energy and electron transfer in photosystem II.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000245083700031	17388444

Much work has been devoted to understanding cation leaching and surface reconstruction of very active electrocatalysts, but little on intentionally promoting the surface in a controlled fashion. We now report controllable anodic leaching of Cr in CoCr2O4 by activating the pristine material at high potential, which enables the transformation of inactive spinel CoCr2O4 into a highly active catalyst. The depletion of Cr and consumption of lattice oxygen facilitate surface defects and oxygen vacancies, exposing Co species to reconstruct into active Co oxyhydroxides differ from CoOOH. A novel mechanism with the evolution of tetrahedrally coordinated surface cation into octahedral configuration via non-concerted proton-electron transfer is proposed. This work shows the importance of controlled anodic potential in modifying the surface chemistry of electrocatalysts.									52	0	0	0	5	0	52			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000618970400001	33372346

Herein, a correlation between the OER overpotential and the cobalt-based electrode composition in a ldquoMicroparticles-in-Spider Webrdquo (MSW) superstructure electrode is revealed. The overpotential is dramatically decreased first and then slightly increased with the continuous increase ratio of Co/Co3O4 in the cobalt-based composite electrode, corresponding to the dynamic change of electrochemically active surface area and charge-transfer resistance with the electrode composition. As a proof-of-concept, the optimized electrode displays a low overpotential of 260 mV at 10.0 mA cm-2 in alkaline conditions with a long-time stability. This electrochemical performance is comparable and even superior to the most currently reported Co-based OER electrocatalysts. The remarkable electrocatalytic activity is attributed to the optimization of the electrochemically active sites and electron transfer in the MSW superstructure. Theoretical calculations identify that the metallic Co and Co3O4 surface catalytic sites play a vital role in improving electron transport and reaction Gibbs free energies for reducing overpotential, respectively. A general way of boosting OER kinetics via optimizing the electrode configurations to mitigate reaction overpotential is offered in this study.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810			INSPEC:20782104

Significantly, in 0.1 m KOH aqueous solution the best sample exhibits an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity that is superior to that of benchmark RuO2 catalysts, an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity that is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C, and an overpotential of only -0.193 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). With this single catalyst for oxygen reversible electrocatalysis, a potential difference of only 0.700 V is observed in 0.1 m KOH solution between the half-wave potential in ORR and the potential to reach 10 mA cm(-2) in OER; in addition, an overpotential of only 450 mV is needed to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for full water splitting in the same electrolyte. The present trifunctional catalytic activities are markedly better than leading results reported in recent literature, where the remarkable trifunctional activity is attributed to the synergetic effects between N,S-codoped rGO, and Co9S8 nanoparticles. These results highlight the significance of deliberate structural engineering in the preparation of multifunctional electrocatalysts for versatile electrochemical reactions.									102	5	0	0	2	0	105			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000408936600012	28692744

NiFe double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH) bifunctional group catalyst is applied to OER/HER under alkaline conditions. The good chemical contact between LDH nanosheets grown in situ (NiFe-LDH) on nickel foam (NF) and nickel foam substrate improves the electrons and ions transportation in the reaction process, which is beneficial to promote the OER/HER. The results show only 464.6/219.4 mV overpotential (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) at 100/10 mA cm-2 for OER/HER, respectively. The stability of D0 (stands for NiFe-LDH/NF) was measured at 10 mA cm-2 worked continuously for 24 h, and it is found that D0 exhibits excellent stable catalytic performance. This work opens up a simple way to design and prepare the efficient, low-cost, and easily synthetic earth-rich electrocatalysts.					2021 IEEE International Conference on Manipulation, Manufacturing and Measurement on the Nanoscale (3M-NANO)2021 IEEE International Conference on Manipulation, Manufacturing and Measurement on the Nanoscale (3M-NANO)	2-6 Aug. 20212-6 Aug. 2021		Xi'an, ChinaXi'an, China	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-6654-4881-9	INSPEC:21438211

Herein, the facile synthesis and systematic characterisation of two highly active and stable oxygen electrocatalysts, i. e., high surface area alpha-MnO2 microspheres and nanoparticulate Co3O4, are reported. alpha-MnO2 exhibits low half-wave potential and potential of -0.197 and -0.226 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at -3 mA cm(-2), respectively, that are only marginally higher compared to commercial Pt/C (E-1/2=-0.161 V, Ej=-3=-0.171 V) for ORR. Meanwhile, Co3O4 needs a potential of 0.601 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) to drive 10 mA cm(-2) being competitive to commercial Ir/C (E-j=10=0.60 V) for OER. In order to create a bifunctional catalyst, two approaches were pursued: i) Co3O4 nanoparticles were homogeneously grown on the surface of alpha-MnO2 microspheres yielding a radial hybrid composite catalyst material in the form of a core (alpha-MnO2) shell (Co3O4) structure and ii), much simpler, individual alpha-MnO2 microspheres and Co3O4 nanoparticles were physically mixed in a powder blend. The powder blend demonstrates superior overall bifunctional catalytic properties such that the individual catalysts still dominate their respective oxygen reaction and, due to synergistic interactions between both catalysts, an improved ORR activity could be achieved.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2196-0216			WOS:000597323800015

Herein, we aimed toward spinel Li2Co2O4, as a desirable system because of the pure Co3+ ions in the as-prepared sample, to clarify the origin of its enhanced activity during in situ evolution. It was discovered that spontaneous extraction of lithium occurs upon the electrochemical condition to generate an amorphous active layer Li2-xCo2O4-delta(OH)(delta) (Co3+/Co4+), resulting in a progressively increased OER reactivity. Additionally, operando X-ray spectroscopy combined with ex situ techniques unraveled that the appearance of Co4+ and oxidized oxygen ions (oxygen sites with electronic hole) is tightly accompanied by this surface reconstruction. Finally, density functional theory calculations further suggested a possible reconstruction pathway and addressed the importance of oxidized oxygen ions that are triggered by Co4+ ions. These new insights are helpful for understanding why high activity occurs in the system with Co4+ ions and thereby developing efficient OER electrocatalysts.									31	2	0	0	2	0	31			2155-5435			WOS:000480503700082

The common counterpart reaction for ORR and CO2RR is the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) from water. The low-overpotential OER catalyzed by nanoparticles (NPs) immobilized on CP has attracted attention for integration in energy-conversion devices. Earth-abundant and low-cost 3d transition metals have been intensively explored as OER catalysts. In this study, we have successfully prepared Fe-Co Prussian blue analog (PBA) NPs with the formulae of Fe1-xCox[Fe(CN)(6)](0.67)center dot nH(2)O and Fe1-yCoy[Co(CN)(6)](0.67).mH(2)O, and the Fe-Co PBA NPs are dispersed into water by surface modification using [Fe(CN)(6)](4-). By a simple drop-coating method, the Fe-Co PBA NPs are immobilized on CP and thermally decomposed into Fe-Co oxides at 400 degrees C. The OER overpotentials of the Fe-Co oxides are gradually decreased by increasing the Co composition ratios, and the lowest overpotential is 0.46 V vs. RHE at 10 mA/cm(2) in y = 0.6.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			0020-1693	1873-3255		WOS:000510860900043

While several studies showed that iron impurities promote the activity of nickel-based catalysts, the effects of intrinsic nickel defects and the underlying mechanism remain unknown. In this work, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is combined with surface-enhanced Raman scattering to understand the reactivity of NiOx thin films, which were prepared at different temperatures and thus varied in their chemical composition and crystalline order. Raman spectroscopy was used to follow the characteristic oxidation of nickel species from Ni-II(OH)(2) to (NiOOH)-O-III and (NiOO-)-O-IV under electrochemical conditions. A stronger oxide-to-hydroxide conversion, consistent with the post-electrochemistry study, was associated with the presence of initial Ni-III impurities and oxygen vacancies and appears beneficial for the electrocatalytic activity.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000718181700011

While theory predicts that the OCl versus OOH scaling relation can be circumvented as soon as the elementary reaction steps in the CER comprise the Cl rather than the OCl adsorbate, it was demonstrated recently that PtN4 sites embedded in a carbon nanotube follow this theoretical prediction. Advanced experimental analyses illustrate that the PtN4 sites also reveal a different reaction kinetics compared to the industrial benchmark of dimensionally stable anodes (DSA). A reverse Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism was identified, in which the rate-determining Volmer step for small overpotentials is followed by the kinetically limiting Heyrovsky step for larger overpotentials. Since the PtN4 sites excel DSA in terms of activity and chlorine selectivity, we suggest the Cl intermediate as well as the reverse Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism as the design criteria for the development of next-generation electrode materials beyond DSA.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2451-9103			WOS:000819871900010

Their final fate is highly uncertain and strongly model dependent. They can become white dwarfs, they can undergo electron-capture or core-collapse supernovae or they might even proceed towards explosive oxygen burning and a subsequent thermonuclear explosion. We believe that an accurate description of nuclear reactions is crucial for the determination of the pre-supernova structure of these stars. We argue that due to the possible development of an oxygen-deflagration, a hydrodynamic description has to be used. We implement a nuclear reaction network with similar to 200 nuclear species into the implicit hydrodynamic code AGILE. The reaction network considers all relevant nuclear electron captures and beta-decays. For selected relevant nuclear species, we include a set of updated reaction rates, for which we discuss the role for the evolution of the stellar core, at the example of selected stellar models. We find that the final fate of these intermediate-mass stars depends sensitively on the density threshold for weak processes that deleptonize the core.					7th Conference on Nuclear Physics in Astrophysics (NPA)7th Conference on Nuclear Physics in Astrophysics (NPA)	MAY 18-22, 2015MAY 18-22, 2015	Univ York; Univ Edinburgh; Canberra; EDF; EPL; EPS; Hamamatsu; IoP; JINA; Kromek; Mesytech; Micron; NAVI; RAS; STFC; SUPAUniv York; Univ Edinburgh; Canberra; EDF; EPL; EPS; Hamamatsu; IoP; JINA; Kromek; Mesytech; Micron; NAVI; RAS; STFC; SUPA	York, ENGLANDYork, ENGLAND	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1742-6588	1742-6596	*****************	WOS:000431673700049

A dedicated electrochemical cell was used, and the OER on the surface of a Co/Pt thin film working electrode in an alkaline solution (NaOH, 0.1 M) was investigated. When the electrode potential was shifted to a positive value, the peak of the oxygen K-edge was successfully detected using this technique, and the peak intensity increased in correlation with the electrode potential. In addition, it was indicated that the oxygen K-edge absorption peak was observed, before the electrode potential reaching the onset potential, i.e., from around 1.0 V vs. relative hydrogen electrode of the electrode potential.

In the absence of any cocatalyst, hydrogen evolution efficiency of 78.9 and 643.0 mu mol h(-1) g(cata)(lyst)(-1) were achieved over a simple carbon nitride catalyst from methanol and formaldehyde solutions, respectively, in 1.0 bar O-2 atmosphere at room temperature. On the carbon nitride catalyst, molecular O-2 is photocatalytically transformed into reactive oxygen species, which acted both as an oxidant and as a homogeneous catalyst for the partial photocatalytic water splitting reaction, resulting in the two-step oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde and subsequently formic acid. DFT calculations reveal that the new oxygen mediated photocatalytic hydrogen evolution pathway proceeds with virtually zero activation energy. Further improvement in hydrogen evolution efficiency was attained by doping the carbon nitride catalyst with phosphorous and sulfur, which promoted the transport of photogenerated charge carriers.									11	1	0	0	1	0	11			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000566452900003

Spinel cobalt oxide (Co3O4), with both tetrahedral (Co2+) and octahedral (Co3+) sites, has been widely studied as an efficient non-precious OER catalyst. However, controversial results still exist regarding its OER performance in determining the active sites from two different tetrahedral and octahedral sites. Here, we have designed size-controllable Co3O4 hexagonal platelets with (111) exposed surfaces only containing tetrahedral Co2+ sites as model catalysts, and systematically investigated the catalytic properties of the tetrahedral sites on the surface of the (111) plane and the octahedral sites on the surface of the (110)-B plane for the OER using density functional theory (DFT) and various characterization methods. The theoretical and experimental results further reveal that the high catalytic activity is based on the existence of octahedral sites in Co3O4, meaning that the octahedral sites are responsible for the OER reaction and have been identified as the dominant active sites of spinel Co3O4.									56	2	0	0	4	0	56			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000490983100039

Herein, we report the successful synthesis of cobalt nanoparticle embedded porous nitrogen doped carbon nanofibers (Co-PNCNFs) by a facile and scalable electrospinning technology. The electrospun Co-PNCNF composite exhibits a low onset potential of 1.45 V (vs. RHE) along with high current density (overpotential of 285 mV for 10 mA cm(-2)) towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The exceptional performance could be ascribed to the bi-functionalized CNFs with nitrogen doping and cobalt encapsulation. Moreover, the porous structure and synergistic effect further provide a highly effective surface area and facilitate a fast electron transfer pathway for the OER process. Interestingly, the Co-PNCNF composite also displays the capability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution. A water electrolyzer cell fabricated by applying Co-PNCNFs as both anode and cathode electrocatalysts in alkaline solution can achieve a high current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.66 V.									72	3	0	0	3	0	72			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000382015100015

In this work, reduced graphene oxide supported uniform core-shell Au@Pt nanoparticles (Au@Pt NPs/rGO) were fabricated by a simple one-pot aqueous approach, using N-methylimidazolium-based dicationic ionic liquid (1,1-bis(3-methylimadazoilum-1-yl)butylene bromide, [C-4(Mim)(2)]2Br) as the shape-directing agent. The morphology evolution, structural information and formation mechanism of Au@Pt NPs anchored on rGO were investigated by a series of characterization techniques. The obtained nanocomposites displayed superior electrocatalytic features toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared with commercial Pt/C catalyst. This approach provides a novel route for facile synthesis of nanocatalysts in fuel cells. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The metal organic framework having surface active hydroxy group is prepared by adding zinc oxide cluster to a methanol solution of 2-methylimidazole, reacting at 80 degrees C for 3 hours to obtain a zinc oxide-doped ZIF-8 cluster, then successively washing with alcohol and water and drying. USE - The method is useful for preparing structure-enhanced nitrogen-phosphorus co-doped carbon nanotube cluster. ADVANTAGE - The method can effectively avoid the phenomenon of agglomeration and structure collapse, and enhance the mechanical properties of graphitized carbon material. The nitrogen-phosphorus co-doped carbon nanotube cluster modified by hypophosphite has improved electrocatalytic performance, not only exhibits excellent catalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction, but also exhibits better performance in the oxygen evolution reaction.															0						DIIDW:201837516L

Application at a global scale requires the discovery of precious metal-free electrocatalysts that unify high energetic efficiency, long-term stability and economic viability. Here we report the striking properties of noble metal-free, alkali-metal cobalt borophosphates acting as robust and efficient materials for bi-functional electrocatalytic water-splitting to give hydrogen and oxygen. Alkali-metal cobalt borophosphates are porous crystalline inorganic materials with chiral DNA-like helical structures bearing two chemically distinct types of water molecules, coordinated and strands of hydrate water associated via hydrogen bonds, located in the channels, which are predestined to possess superior catalytic performance. Depending on the applied electrode potential, they can be reversibly switched between catalysis of the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, both at low overpotentials. This bifunctionality provides access to technologically simple overall water-splitting systems with energetic efficiencies exceeding the 75% level (above 90% based on a higher heating value) and uncompromised long-term stability, now verified with a two-and-a-half month period.									137	8	0	0	3	0	138			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000462661900011

In this study, we synthesized carbon nanofibers with embedded FeNi composites (FeNi-CNFs) as OER electrocatalysts by a facile route comprising electrospinning and the pyrolysis of a mixture of metal precursors and a polymer solution. FeNi-CNFs demonstrated catalytic activity and stability that were better than that of 20 wt% Ir on Vulcan carbon black in oxidizing water to produce oxygen in an alkaline media. Physicochemical and electrochemical characterization revealed that Fe and Ni had synergistic roles that enhanced OER activity by the uniform formation and widening of pores in the carbon structure, while the CNF matrix also contributed to the increased stability of the catalyst.

Extensive trials have been invested to develop earth-abundant oxygen catalysts to lower the cost and to boost the energy efficiency of these electrochemical devices. Among these oxygen catalysts, manganese dioxide (MnO2) is attracting ever-increasing interest owing to its high earth-abundance, low cost, and well-balanced activity-stability performances. In this review, the mechanisms of ORR and OER catalysis, methods for activity enhancement, and various applications of MnO2 oxygen catalysts in energy conversion and storage are summarized and discussed. As the ORR and OER catalysts in the whole pH range, the Mn3+ intermediate in MnO2 is identified as the active center. To optimize the catalytic performance of MnO2, the strategies of heteroatom doping, morphology tuning, heterostructure forming, conductor supporting, defect engineering, and valence regulating are implemented. Moreover, the applications of MnO2 in metal-air batteries, fuel cells and water splitting systems are detailed. Lastly, some prospects of MnO2 oxygen catalysts are proposed for the further development.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000636272000004

While past studies most often focused on the activity and stability of the active oxide phase along with the surface area and durability of the support material of the combined catalyst/support couple, the influence of the immobilization method on its performance has been widely overlooked. Here, we emphasize the potential and limitations of the presented support methods and evaluate their applicability by means of controlling the metal loading, particle size and the accessibility of surface sites. Further, we present a technique applicable for tuning the loading of the metal oxide catalyst up to 20 wt. % avoiding agglomeration. We also establish a correlation between metal oxide loading and mass-based oxygen evolution activity.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0926-860X	1873-3875		WOS:000450018600002

This was achieved through the estimation of the functional dependence from both, the dissolved oxygen and the NaCl concentration for each of the kinetic parameters involved in the corrosion process. The main finding is the existence of the critical dissolved oxygen value at which a notorious change in variational pattern for corrosion potential, corrosion current density and hydrogen evolution is observed. The validity of this feature is supported from experimental evidence reported in previous investigations. In this context the role of pitting corrosion, oxide film and diffusional effects are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In theory, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a vital factor in controlling water splitting efficiency due to its sluggish kinetics. Accordingly, a facile solvothermal approach was utilized to synthesize hollow Ni0.85Se porous materials embedded by carbon materials (Ni0.85Se/C), serving as catalysts of OER. In contrast to the unsupported Ni0.85Se and RuO2, the obtained Ni0.85Se/C catalyst has better electrochemical performances owing to the addition of carbon and the presence of hollow structure. In addition, the decent durability of Ni0.85Se/C provides the possibility for the practical use.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0167-577X	1873-4979		WOS:000705828100003

Journal of colloid and interface science				623				552	560		10.1016/j.jcis.2022.04.181				2022-Oct	2022	Sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction during the water splitting requires high-performance electrocatalysts with low cost and good stability. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted much attention as electrocatalysts owing to their unique properties. To improve their electrocatalytic activity and stability, we report a selenylation method to modulate the morphology and interfaces by forming flower-like MOF-selenide nanocomposites. The optimal sample exhibits high activity with an overpotential of 260mV at 10mAcm-2, much better than commercial RuO2 and the control samples. Moreover, the optimal sample has the lowest Tafel slope of 54.3mV dec-1, indicating the fast reaction kinetics, which can be attributed to the lower charge-transfer resistance and high intrinsic activity. Chronoamperometry shows that the optimal sample can maintain the current density for 60h at 10mAcm-2 after the initial surface reconstruction, demonstrating good stability. This study provides a new perspective on the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts based on polymetallic MOFs.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				1095-7103		MEDLINE:35598484	35598484

Although much effort has been made, mechanisms for the above problems are poorly understood. Studying the cycling and float-charging characteristics of Li/NCM811 cells in high voltage conditions (4.5 V and 4.7 V, respectively), in this work we find that nearly all known problems with NCM811 material can be attributed to the oxidation of lattice oxygen occurring in the capacity region corresponding to H2 -> H3 phase transition. While contributing to overall capacity, the oxidation of lattice oxygen results in a loss of oxygen through oxygen evolution and relative reactions between active oxygen evolution intermediates and electrolyte solvents. It is the loss of oxygen that results in irreversible layered-spinel-rocksalt phase transition, secondary particle cracking, and performance degradation. The conclusions of this work suggest that the priority for further research on NCM811 material should give to the suppression of oxygen evolution, followed by the use of the anti-oxygen electrolyte being chemically stable against the active oxygen evolution intermediates.

However, the performance of YTOS in photocatalytic water splitting has remained low. One important factor accounting for this poor activity is the absence of highly efficient active sites. Surface modification with oxygen-evolution co-catalysts is indispensable for enhancing the activity and durability of non-oxide narrow-bandgap photocatalysts. Herein, we report the preparation of cobalt oxide (Co3O4)-loaded YTOS for photocatalytic oxygen evolution. The Co3O4 co-catalyst was loaded by thermal decomposition of cobalt nitrate. The as-obtained sample showed significantly enhanced activity in the oxygen evolution reaction compared with unmodified or IrO2-loaded YTOS. Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that the Co3O4 co-catalyst captured holes and promoted charge separation, which accounted for the enhanced activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2367-0932			WOS:000850481900001

Herein, a Ni9S8/MoS2 decorated NiMoO4 nanorod heterostructure (Ni9S8/MoS2@NiMoO4) is successfully developed via a facile hydrothermal process followed by a direct sulfurization. The resulting hierarchical nanoarchitecture with outer Ni9S8/MoS2 nanosheets shell on the inner NiMoO4 core supplies affordable active sites and plentiful charge transportation channels in continuous heterointerfaces. Accordingly, the Ni9S8/MoS2@NiMoO4 only needs low overpotentials of 190 and 360 mV to enable 10 mA cm(-2) current density for HER and OER in alkaline solution, respectively. This work provides a rational strategy for designing electrocatalysts with high efficiency for water splitting, enlightening the road of developing low-cost bifunctional materials in energy conversion area.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2196-7350			WOS:000705112100001

On the basis of an analysis of existing electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution alternative reaction possibilities are compared: one-electron transfer, four-electron transfer and the role of intermediates chemically bonded to a catalyst. For the manganese complex of photosynthetic oxygen evolution the puzzling situation is that electrocatalytically poorly active Mn metal centres in a fragile complex are highly catalytic for oxygen evolution. The conclusion is reached that the complex organizes itself into a favourable transition state through an autocatalytic process (export of entropy) that facilities a real (intermediate-free) four-electron transfer. An experimental model system for oscillating hydrogen evolution is discussed to demonstrate the feasibility of synergetic reactions for fuel generation. The energetic and kinetic advantages of a synergetic mechanism of water splitting are outlined and a kinetic model is calculated which simulates oscillations observed in photosynthetic oxygen evolution.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:A1995TE60700009

Herein, a self-supported FeNiCo-based amorphous catalyst with a hierarchical micro/nanoporous structure is fabricated by dealloying an amorphous/nanocrystalline precursor. The amorphous nanoporous framework enables the prepared electrocatalyst to afford fast reaction kinetics, abundant active sites, and enhanced electrochemical active surface areas (ECSAs). Such structural advantages and the synergistic effects of the ternary transition metals contribute to a dramatic catalytic activity of this electrocatalyst under alkaline conditions, which delivers the current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a low overpotential of 134 mV for HER and 206 mV for OER, respectively. Furthermore, a full electrolysis apparatus constructed by the self-supported hierarchical micro/nanoporous FeNiCo-based amorphous electrocatalyst as both cathode and anode acquires a dramatically low voltage of 1.58 V operating at 10 mA cm-2 along with stability for more than 24 h for overall water splitting.

However, to meet industrial demands with electrolysis-generated hydrogen, the development of a low-cost and efficient catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical, while conventional catalysts are mostly based on precious metals. Many studies have thus focused on exploring new efficient nonprecious-metal catalytic systems and improving the understandings on the OER mechanism, resulting in the design of catalysts with superior activity compared with that of conventional catalysts. In particular, the use of multimetal rather than single-metal catalysts is demonstrated to yield remarkable performance improvement, as the metal composition in these catalysts can be tailored to modify the intrinsic properties affecting the OER. Herein, recent progress and accomplishments of multimetal catalytic systems, including several important groups of catalysts: layered hydroxide, spinel, and amorphous metal oxides along with the theoretical principles of activity enhancement in multimetal systems are reviewed. Finally, this is concluded by discussing remaining challenges to achieve further improvements of OER catalyst activities.									482	21	0	0	14	0	484			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000430163100024

Despite numerous studies on electrocatalysts, the development of bifunctional electrocatalysts with comparatively better activity and low cost remains a big challenge. In this paper, we report a nanomaterial consisting of nanocactus-shaped Co3O4 grown on carbon nanotubes (Co3O4/CNTs) and employed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the simultaneous catalysis on ORR, and OER. The Co3O4/CNTs exhibit superior catalytic activity toward ORR and OER with the smallest potential difference (0.72 V) between the E-j10 (1.55 V) for OER and E-1/2 (0.83 V) for ORR. Thus, Co3O4/CNTs are promising high-performance and cost-effective bifunctional catalysts for ORR and OER because of their overall superior catalytic activity and stability compared with 20 wt% Pt/C and RuO2, respectively. The superior catalytic activity arises from the unique nanocactus-like structure of Co3O4 and the synergetic effects of Co3O4 and CNTs.									81	7	0	0	4	0	82			2045-2322			WOS:000424318700015	29416089

In addition, there are widely synergistic effects between the metallic species and the carbon supports for accelerated and stable electrocatalysis. In this work, a rhodium nanocrystal hybrid with single-walled carbon nanotubes (Rh/SWNTs) is reported to be an advanced catalyst for electrocatalytic reactions. SWNTs, as good electron acceptors, could modulate the electronic structure of Rh NPs and produce optimized electron polarization, which can give a high-performance interface catalyst. More eye catching are the excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) properties in acid and alkali achieved by Rh/SWNTs with small over potential (at 10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope (25 mV and 20 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4, 48 mV and 27 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH, respectively). Meanwhile, such electron polarization could also improve the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) properties. The Rh/SWNTs show high efficiency in overall water splitting and an integrated zinc air battery with a low cell voltage of 1.59 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and a high open-circuit voltage of 1.42 V. This work highlights an electron polarization strategy on the interface between Rh and SWNTs to develop a high-performance multifunctional hydrogen and oxygen catalyst.									70	2	0	0	3	0	70			2155-5435			WOS:000444364800038

Catalytic activities of La1.7Sr0.3CO0.5Ni0.5O4+delta toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were systematically investigated by the rotating disk electrode (RDE) technique in alkaline media. Compared to La2NiO4+delta, La1.7Sr0.3CO0.5Ni0.5O4+delta demonstrated more active for ORR in terms of the higher limiting current density ( - 4.05 mA.cm(-2)) and higher half-wave potential (0.568 V vs. RHE) at 1600 rpm. Zinc-air batteries using La1.7Sr0.3CO0.5Ni0.5O4+delta as the catalyst exhibited the higher peak power density (60 mW.cm(-2)), the lower discharge-charge voltage gap (1.26 V) after 100 cycles and good discharge-charge cycling stability than that of La2NiO4+delta.									22	1	0	0	0	0	23			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000447744200060

However, the poor electrical conductivity and low structural stability seriously restrict their practical applications in electronic devices. Herein, the rational design and synthesis of a hierarchically structured 2D bimetallic CoNi-hexaaminobenzene CPs derived from Co(OH)(2) are reported as an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) self-supported electrode. The as-obtained electrode possesses high electrochemical surface area and intrinsic activity, exhibiting high electrochemical catalytic activity, favorable reaction kinetics performance, and strong durability compared with those of the powder catalysts. As a result, the electrode delivers low overpotential of 219 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1) as well as 91.3% retention of current density after 24 h of reaction time. The results of density functional theory computations reveal that the synergistic effect of Co and Ni plays an important role in OER. This work not only presents a strategy to fabricate advanced self-supported electrodes with abundant and dense active sites, but also promotes the development of conjugated CPs for electrocatalysis.									23	2	0	0	1	0	23			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000511246500001	32003933

The fact that BDD-IrO2 electrode behaves similarly to IrO2-DSA type electrodes suggests that the IrO2 clusters on the BDD surface act as redox catalysts in both oxygen evolution and organics oxidation.

Transition/post-transition metal oxide based catalyst development is now the thrust area in the above-mentioned context for efficient energy conversions, especially oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, for the first time, application of electrospun beta-gallium oxide (beta-Ga2O3) nanofibers, a post-transition metal oxide, as an efficient bifunctional catalyst material is reported. These nanofibers are highly porous (specific surface area similar to 100-300 m(2)/g) and exhibit a mesoporous architecture (pore size similar to 1.5-2 nm) which facilitates better ion transport through the spongy morphology of individual nanofiber. The fabricated beta-Ga2O3 nanofibers performed at par with the Pt/C catalyst, like for ORR the onset potential was 0.84 V (vs RHE) and for HER, although the onset potential was -0.34 V (vs RHE), the current density was visibly better than the latter catalyst. This catalyst also performed much better in methanol tolerance test and was near similar in current retention for 6 h, as measured in chronoamperometry. This performance was solely attributed to the large surface area and unique morphology presented by the material, via a rather simple fabrication technique, without addition of any dopant material.									15	2	0	0	1	0	15			2574-0970			WOS:000464491500009

Taking advantage of their high anionic charge, we have incorporated a cobalt-based POM as dopant into an organic conducting polymer matrix (polypyrrole). This heterostructure combines the catalytic water oxidation features from the POM, together with the unique processability of polypyrrole. We have optimized the electrocatalytic performance by studying the effect of several parameters, such as the POM content, film thickness, counter anions, and so forth. It is remarkable that less than 6% POM content in a polypyrrole film multiplies oxygen evolution reaction currents by one order of magnitude, reducing the required overpotentials by approximately 200 mV. Despite the moderate efficiency (ca. 65%), this strategy, being based on inexpensive and readily available raw materials, may be useful for the preparation of water splitting anodes that can be adapted to any surface, geometry, or support.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			2196-0216			WOS:000419269000036

Herein, Mo substituted Fe sites and S doped in inert PBA were designed and synthesized by hydrothermal method to enhance structural stability and OER activity. PBA-SMo/NF shows the optimum activity with a low overpotential of 252 and 294 mV for harvesting current density 20 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, and exhibits excellent durability under high current density. Theoretical calculation of H2O adsorption energy and Bader charges reveals that Mo sites in PBA-SMo possess favourable H2O adsorption kinetics. More important, Gibbs free energy diagram and DOS show PBA-SMo have lower energy barriers for OER and better conductivity. This work provides a kind of guidance for the design and optimization of PBA for broad applications.

These promising and renewable energy alternatives implicate three pivotal reactions: oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The design and synthesis of materials for efficient catalysis toward HER, OER, and ORR are of paramount importance. To address these aims, electro- and photoelectro-catalysts based on the controlled pyrolysis of bimetallic amorphous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are developed. The present study provides a general method for the design and synthesis of bimetallic amorphous MOFs by merging our liquid-liquid interface synthesis method and the metalloligand approach. As a proof of concept, NEU-5 (= [Zn(FeTpyCOOH)(PF6)(2)](n)), NEU-6 (= [Zn(Ru(terpy*)(2))(PF6)(2)](n)), NEU-7 (= [Fe(Ru(terpy*)(2))(PF6)(2)](n)) and NEU-8 (= [Ti(Ru(terpy*)(2))(PF6)(2)](n)) are successfully synthesized, and subsequently pyrolyzed to prepare Fe2P@PNDCN, RuP@PNDCN, Fe3O4/RuO2@NEU-7 and Ru2O/TiN/TiO2@NEU-8, respectively. These electro- and photoelectro-catalysts exhibit excellent activity for ORR, OER and HER in both acidic and alkaline media.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000598674500011

In this paper, we propose a scalable high-throughput bubble screening method that is able to identify themulticomponent alloys with the highest catalytic properties. As ademonstration, the optimum compositions with advanced intrinsiccatalytic activities in the ternary Ni-Co-Ti and Ni-Fe-Au alloysare identified using this method. The advanced catalytic perform-ance of the optimum Ni56.5Co35Ti8.5alloy ribbon is furtherconfirmed by the individual electrochemical tests, with an over-potential of about 425 mV at 500 mA cm-2and a Tafel slope ofabout 82 mV dec-1. This is attributed to the low atomic packing density and low electron binding energy. The introduced scalablehigh-throughput strategy is not limited to ternary catalysts for HER but is also expected to be equally useful for exploring catalysts inhigher composition alloy systems and even for oxygen evolution reactions.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000784255800006

These robust, porous materials have garnered significant interest because of their outstanding properties as catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, the synthesis of Co- and Ni-containing ZIF-67 embedded in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to be used as a cathode material for rechargeable zinc-air batteries is described. Carbon-nanotube-encapsulated metallic Co and Ni form via calcination of the MOF at 700 degrees C for 4 h and are characterized by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Co and Ni graphitization within the CNTs is analyzed by Raman spectroscopy, and morphologies are assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and TEM. Excellent electrochemical performance of the prepared catalysts during charging and discharging reveals that the catalyst is stable for well over 500 h. Moreover, superior OER performance is observed when CNT@Co or CNT@Ni is used as a bifunctional catalyst in the zinc-air battery.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			1862-6300	1862-6319		WOS:000530462700001

The practical application of Zn-air batteries, however, is severely restricted by the high overpotential, which is associated with the inherent sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of air electrocatalysts. Recently, engineering heterostructured/hybrid electrocatalysts with modulated interface chemistry have been demonstrated as an effective strategy to improve the catalytic performance. Significant electronic effects, geometric effects, coordination effects, synergistic effects, and confinement effects occur at the heterostructure interface, which intensely affect electrocatalysts' performance in terms of intrinsic activity, active site density, and durability. In this review, the recent progress in the development of heterostructured air electrocatalysts by interface engineering is summarized. Particularly, the potential relationship between interface chemistry and oxygen electrocatalysis kinetics is bridged and outlined. This review provides a comprehensive and in-depth outline of the crucial role of the well-defined interfaces towards fast oxygen electrocatalysis, and offers a solid scientific basis for the rational design of efficient heterostructured air electrocatalysts and beyond.									52	3	0	0	2	0	52			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000598979300001

In this work, FeCo2O4 powders were prepared by hydrothermal, solid-state, and sol-gel methods to explore the optimal synthesis process of spinel oxides. The effects of annealing temperature on spinel structure were also investigated. In addition, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalytic activities, and practical applications of FeCo2O4 in electrochemical energy conversion devices were explored. Specifically, single-phase FeCo2O4 with smaller particle sizes can be prepared by a procedure including the hydrothermal method and subsequent annealing at 900 degrees C. Moreover, the composite of FeCo2O4 and EC600JD shows splendid OER and ORR activities. And FeCo2O4 spinel oxide reaches a maximum power density of 97.63 mW.cm(-2) when applied as air cathode of the aluminum-air battery. Our work demonstrates that FeCo2O4 with a simple synthesis process and preeminent electrocatalytic performance is a promising catalyst for metal-air batteries.

Here, a straightforward procedure to form novel porous and highly active multimetallic oxygen evolution catalysts was reported. They were derived from an original dendritic nickel foam (NiNF) using two strategies: i) Fe-doping; and ii) Fe/Cr-doping. A bimetallic NiFe catalyst, formed through controlled acid treatment followed by a simple galvanic exchange procedure proved remarkably active in 1 m KOH with a very low overpotential value of eta(200)=276 mV at 200 mA cm(-2) and a very low Tafel slope of 25 mV dec(-1). A trimetallic FeNiCr catalyst, containing 11 % Cr, was also synthesised through electrodeposition and partial Cr leaching, to form a stable OER catalyst displaying a very low overpotential value of eta(200)=279 mV at 200 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 29 mV dec(-1). These two novel catalysts are among the best performing OER catalysts reported so far.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2196-0216			WOS:000773947300001

The Cu3P film is amorphous and has a flat morphology with surface voids. It works as an electrocatalyst for water oxidation in an alkaline 1 M KOH electrolyte. It exhibits excellent catalytic oxygen evolution reaction with an overpotential of 310 mV, Tafel slope of 88 mV/dec, and good stability over 20 h of operation at 10 mA/cm(2). The excellent OER performance is due to its large electrochemically active surface area and low charge transfer resistance at the catalyst-electrolyte interface after the annealing.

Cyclic voltammograms show that Fe impurities have a significant catalytic effect on OER activity; however, both under purified and unpurified conditions, the trend in OER activity is Cs+ > Na+ > K+ > Li+, suggesting an intrinsic cation effect of the OER activity on Fe-free Ni oxyhydroxide. In situ surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), shows this cation dependence is related to the formation of superoxo OER intermediate (NiOO-). The electrochemically active surface area, evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), is not influenced significantly by the cation. We postulate that the cations interact with the Ni-OO- species leading to the formation of NiOO--M+ species that is stabilized better by bigger cations (Cs+). This species would then act as the precursor to O-2 evolution, explaining the higher activity.									103	4	0	0	9	0	104			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000479606700001	31250499

Herein, the ultrathin amorphous Al2O3 nanosheets decorated with CoPS nano particles (size: 4-12 nm) were successfully synthesized using a CoAl-layered double hydroxide (CoAl-LDH) as precursor. The as-prepared catalysts exhibit low onset overpotential of 67 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction and 250 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction together with good stability in an alkaline medium. Moreover, employed as the bifunctional electrocatalysts with a two-electrode electrolyzer, the CoPS nanostructure also produced a small cell voltage of 1.75 V to attain 10 mA cm(-2). The excellent electrocatalytic performance could be attributed not only to the high electron-donating and electron-accepting characters of P2- ligands and Co3+ ions, respectively, but also to the large active surface area and porous structure of the sample. This study introduces a new method for synthesizing ultrathin LDH nanosheets and provides a promising candidate toward highly active electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									25	1	0	0	1	0	25			2168-0485			WOS:000441475500063

In this work, we report a facile dealloying method based on metallic glass (Ni61Zr36Mo3) to introduce abundant oxygen vacancies (O-v) for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The corroded ribbons are composed of a sandwich-like structure with Ni-Mo-O nanoporous layer outside and raw metallic glass inside. This complex structure delivers a low overpotential of 71 +/- 2.6 mV at -20 mA cm(geo)(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution, a Tafel slope of 57 +/- 3 mV dec(-1), and 100 h long-term stability for HER, which is much better than those of the crystallized counterpart, nanoporous Ni, and the commercial benchmark 20% Pt/C electrocatalyst. The high concentration of oxygen vacancies (71.5%), the alloying effect of Mo, and amorphous composition synergistically contribute to the superior electrocatalytic ability and enhanced reaction kinetic of nanoporous Ni-Mo-O, indicating it an excellent low-cost alternative for platinum in hydrogen production.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			2574-0962			WOS:000516665300011

Herein, a simple method was employed to synthesize Mo-doped NiCoP nanowires on a metallic 3D Ni foam (Mo-NiCoP/NF) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This long-term stable MoNiCoP/NF catalyst demonstrated comparatively low overpotentials and excellent dual-functional catalytic performances. The overpotentials for the HER and OER were 64 and 262 mV, respectively, to actuate a current density of 10 mA cm-2 in an alkaline environment (1 M KOH). Meanwhile, when this electrocatalyst was utilized for overall water splitting, a cell voltage of 1.56 V could supply a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for at least 50 h with a negligible performance drop.

Herein, one-pot synthesis was introduced for MoS2-Ni3S2 heteronanorods supported by Ni foam (MoS2-Ni3S2 HNRs/NF), in which the Ni3S2 nanorods were hierarchically integrated with MoS2 nanosheets. The hierarchical MoS2-Ni3S2 heteronanorods allow not only the good exposure of highly active heterointerfaces but also the facilitated charge transport along Ni3S2 nanorods anchored on conducting nickel foam, accomplishing the promoted kinetics and activity for HER, OER, and overall water splitting. The optimal MoS2-Ni3S2 HNRs/NF presents low overpotentials (eta(10)) of 98 and 249 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH for HER and OER, respectively. Assembled as an electrolyzer for overall water splitting, such heteronanorods show a quite low cell voltage of 1.50 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and remarkable stability for more than 48 h, which are among the best values of current noble-metal-free electrocatalysts.

J	Vadakkekara, Raji; Jadkar, Sandesh R.								3D Urchin-like Hierarchical Black TiO2 Hollow Nanospheres: A Highly Active and Stable Electrocatalyst for Water Oxidation in Alkaline and Neutral Media								ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS				5	1			674	684		10.1021/acsaem.1c03172		DEC 2021		JAN 24 2022	2022	Highly proficient, earth-abundant, long-term stable bifunctional electrocatalysts are very much desired for overall water splitting reactions. The present paper describes one such stable bifunctional electrocatalyst, 3D hollow nanostructured hierarchical hydrogenated TiO2 (H-TiO2) prepared by low-temperature treatment. The H-TiO2 electrocatalyst can catalyze oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a low overpotential of 270 and 128 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media. Moreover, it exhibits an unusual catalytic activity in neutral electrolyte as well. The corresponding lower Tafel values indicate faster reaction kinetics on the H-TiO2 surfaces. When H-TiO2 is implemented as both the anode and cathode in a two-electrode system for overall water splitting in alkaline and neutral media, it only needs 1.57 and 2.11 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and displays good durability for 12 h. The results suggest that Ti3+ and abundant oxygen vacancies in H-TiO2 favor HER and OER, which might originate from the enhanced electrical conductivity and rapid charge transfer rate due to the controlled interplay of the favoring factors. Thus, the present research work demonstrates a promising strategy for developing a highly efficient, stable, and carbon-free substitute for noble metal-based electrocatalysts for the overall water splitting in alkaline and neutral media.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000736557800001

The in situ growth of vertical two-dimensional (2D) nickel phosphorus trisulfide (NiPS3) nanosheets on nickel foam (NiPS3/Ni) by one-step chemical vapor transport treatment of nickel foam using red phosphorus and sulfur powder is presented. Benefitting from the unique three-dimensional (3D) structure with a large exposed active surface area from vertically aligned nanosheets and facilitated electron transport along 2D nanosheets anchored on conductive nickel foam, the NiPS3/Ni electrode requires low overpotentials of 74 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 283 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution. Remarkably, the constructed two-electrode alkaline water electrolyzer using NiPS3/Ni as both anode and cathode catalysts only requires a voltage of 1.60 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The low cost, facile fabrication process, and desirable catalytic performance make the self-supported NiPS3/Ni electrode a promising electrocatalyst for practical water electrolysis.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2398-4902			WOS:000640674300001

Herein, ternary pyrite type nanosized cobalt phosphosulphide is reported as an excellent oxygen reduction/oxygen evolution catalyst in alkaline medium with a favorable reversible oxygen electrode index (difference between E-10mA for oxygen evolution and E-3mA for oxygen reduction) of 0.69 V. Four-electron reduction with low overpotential of similar to 240 mV to observe a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is reported. The assembled zinc-air batteries with both aqueous liquid- and gel-based electrolytes display stable low charge-discharge voltage polarization over a long duration. Aqueous primary zinc-air battery exhibits an impressive peak power density of 385 mW cm(-2) at 560 mA cm(-2) and a current density of 220 mA cm(-2) at 1.0 V. The zinc-air battery in the air-breathing, rechargeable mode operates for over 100 h at 10 mA cm(-2) and over a few hundred cycles under a drain current of 50 mAcm(-2). The rechargeable battery has been investigated for both long term (4 h) and short term (10 min) cycles under different drain currents (10, 20 and 50 mA cm(-2)). Round trip efficiencies of-64% have been achieved. Use of CoPS electrodes with gel-based electrolytes has also been demonstrated. The primary gel battery displays a specific capacity of 803 mA cm(-2) corresponding to an energy density of 891 Wh kg(-1). The high efficiency and durability of the catalyst establish its feasibility as a cost-effective alternative to precious metal catalysts.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000517663800055

Although MoS2 is a promising hydrogen evolution electrocatalyst, its oxygen evolution activity is significantly poor due to its weak adsorption for oxidative intermediates such as OH* and OOH*. Here, we present a strategy for designing 3d-TM-O-x (x = 3, 6; TM: transition metal) single-atom catalytic sites to achieve high catalytic activity towards the OER through an unprecedented dynamic coordination transformation from [TMO6] to [TMO3]. By using first-principles calculations and molecular dynamic simulations, we predict single 3d-transition metal atoms (3d-TM) co-doped with six oxygen atoms of MoS2 (3d-TMO6@MoS2) with hexa-coordinated TM (TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe and Co) and tri-coordinated TM (TM = Ni, Cu and Zn) structures. Our calculations show that these hexa-coordinated TMs are induced to transform into a tetra-coordinated structure as oxidative intermediates approach. The dynamic single-atom catalytic mechanism makes active sites and adsorption-responsive orbitals exposed, which is favorable to strengthen the adsorption of oxidative intermediates and improve the OER catalytic activity. Comparative calculations demonstrate that TMO6@MoS2 (TM = Fe, Mn and Co) species render better electrocatalytic activity for the OER than benchmark IrO2. Experimental Raman studies verified that FeO6@MoS2 experiences coordination transformation from [TMO6] to [TMO3] during the OER process. The low overpotential of 0.18 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and good structural stability are consistent with our computational prediction. The present study sheds light on deep understanding of single-atom catalytic structures in transition metal dichalcogenides and the methodology to tune the catalytic activity of single-atom sites.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000797034100001

Here, we synthesized a three-dimensional nanoporous Ir70Ni30-xCox alloy microwires as oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst using a dealloying strategy. The three dimensional binder-free np-Ir70Ni15Co15 catalyst in 0.1 M HClO4 shows a low overpotential (220 mV@ eta = 10 mA cm(-2)), low Tafel slope (44.1 mV dec(-1)) and excellent corrosion resistance, significantly outperforming commercial IrO2 catalysts. The excellent performance is attributed to the nanoporous structure and the alloying effect, which promote the permeation of electrolyte, accelerate the transportation of electrons. More importantly, the high valence Ir oxide species with low-coordination structure in np-Ir70Ni15Co15 alloy are identified for the real catalytic sites of OER process by the XAS results acquired on synchrotron radiation. This work not only provides fundamental understandings of the correlation between surface activity and stability for OER catalysts, but also paves a new way to advanced electrocatalysts working in acidic media.									90	6	0	0	4	0	90			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000463032200018

In recent years, HEA nanoparticles (HEA-NPs) were paid much attention to in the field of catalysis for the promoted catalytic activity. Furthermore, the various ratios among the metal components and tunable bulk and surface structures enable HEAs have big room to enhance the catalytic performance. Especially, noble-metal-based HEAs displayed significantly improved performance in electrocatalysis, where the 'core effects' were employed to explain the superior catalytic activity. However, it is insufficient to understand the essential mechanism or further guide the design of electrocatalysts. Structure-property relationship should be disclosed for the catalysis on HEA-NPs to accelerate the process of seeking high effective and efficient electrocatalysts. Therefore, we summarized the recent advances of noble-metal-based HEA-NPs applied to electrocatalysis, such as hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, methanol oxidation reaction, ethanol oxidation reaction, formic acid oxidation reaction, hydrogen oxidation reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction and nitrogen reduction reaction. For each electrocatalytic reaction, the reaction mechanism and catalyst structure were presented, and then the structure-property relationship was elaborated. The review begins with the development, concept, four 'core effect' and synthesis methods of HEAs. Next, the electrocatalytic reactions on noble-metal-based HEA-NPs are summarized and discussed independently. Lastly, the main views and difficulties pertaining to structure-property relationship for HEAs are discussed.(c) 2021 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The clear identification of the catalytic-active sites and elucidation of the reaction mechanisms in these systems remain a grand challenge. It requires simultaneous characterizations of the catalysts under actual reaction conditions. Raman spectroscopy is among the handful of techniques that are suitable for the in situ/operando investigations of heterogeneous catalytic systems. This Perspective will highlight primarily recent works on the application of Raman spectroscopy in unraveling the structural changes of catalysts, their possible active sites, and the intermediates formed during water electrolysis and CO, electroreduction. Results from complementary techniques such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy, among others, will also be presented in order to provide a more holistic discussion.

The Ni3C based nanosheets have lateral length of about 200 nm and thickness of 10 nm. When doped with Fe, the Ni3C based nanosheets exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic properties for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). For example, 2 at % Fe (atomic percent) doped Ni3C nanosheets depict a low overpotential (292 mV) and a small Tafel slope (41.3 mV dec(-1)) for HER in KOH solution. An outstanding OER catalytic property is also achieved with a low overpotential of 275 mV and a small Tafel slope of 62 mV dec(-1) in KOH solution. Such nanodot-incorporated 2D hybrid structures can serve as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.									257	20	0	0	5	0	258			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000411810600025	28809076

Nevertheless, the manipulation of the amorphous phase in metal-based catalysts is so far impractical, and thus their electrocatalytic mechanism yet remains ambiguous. In this review, the latest advances in AMCs are systematically reviewed, covering amorphous-phase engineering strategy, structure manipulation, and amorphization of various material categories for electrocatalysis. Specifically, a series of applications of AMCs in electrocatalysis for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are summarized based on the classification criteria of substances. Finally, we put forward current challenges that have not yet been clarified in the field of AMCs, and propose possible solutions, particularly from the perspective of the evolution of electron microscopy. It is expected to promote the understanding of the amorphization-catalysis relationship and provide a guideline for designing high-performance electrocatalysts. ?? 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The editorial office of Journal of Materials Science & Technology.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1005-0302	1941-1162		WOS:000798055400001

The Ni's charge-state, phase compositions, and electrocatalytic performances are dependent on the initial mass ratios of Ni to Se. The experimental results demonstrate that the electrocatalyst with a higher Ni charge-state and more Ni3Se4 phase facilitates oxygen evolution reaction (OER), whereas the one with a lower Ni charge-state and more NiSe2 phase boosts hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the interfacial electrons transfer from Ni3Se4 to NiSe2, which improves conductivity and optimizes adsorption/desorption energies. NiSe2/Ni3Se4/NF-4 containing more NiSe2 phase displays the best HER activity while NiSe2/Ni3Se4/NF-1 containing more Ni3Se4 phase shows the best HER activity. The electrolyzer, employing NiSe2/Ni3Se4/NF-4 and NiSe2/Ni3Se4/NF-1 as the cathode and anode, respectively, performs the full potential and demonstrates a low voltage of 1.56 V achieving 10 mA cm(-2) with good durability.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000727812600004

Eriochrome black T (EBT) has phenolic hydroxyl and -N = N- groups, which provides multiple coordination sites for metal ions. Herein, Co9S8 nanoclusters implanted in Co/Mn-S,N multi-doped porous carbon (Co9S8@Co/Mn-S,N-PC) are fabricated with the mixture (i.e. EBT, metal precursors and dicyandiamide) by a coordination regulated pyrolysis strategy. Specifically, EBT effectively chelates with the Co and Mn ions, resulting in multiple incorporation and fine modulation of the carbon electronic structures. Meanwhile, its sulfonic acid groups are reduced at such high temperature, accompanied by simultaneously embedding S element in the carbon, ultimately in situ forming Co9S8 nanoclusters. The Co9S8@Co/Mn-S,N-PC performs as an effective bifunctional oxygen catalyst, displaying a positive half-wave potential of 0.85 V and a large limiting current density of 5.89 mA cm (2) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media, coupled with a small overpotential of 320 mV at 10 mA cm (2) towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER), outperforming commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts, respectively. Furthermore, the assembled rechargeable Zn-air battery with Co9S8@Co/Mn-S,N-PC exhibits the much better charge/discharge performance and long-term durability (210 h, 630 cycles). This research opens an instructive avenue to develop high-efficient and stable bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts in energy transformation and storage devices. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

IrO2 catalysts and Ti current collectors are among the best in this regard. We show evidence of iridium and titanium corrosion and subsequent membrane crossover in long-term experiments of proton-exchange membrane electrolyzers for H2O2 production. The accumulation of trace iridium at the cathode was linked to degraded performance and increased cathodic current from hydrogen evolution. Detection of trace metal content at the cathode electrodes was enabled by prompt-gamma ray activation analysis and neutron activation analysis. These findings are not just relevant for H2O2 electrolyzers but to any system using iridium-based anode catalysts, including CO2 electroreduction.

Cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) materials have been widely explored as oxygen-involving electrocatalysts but their intrinsic catalytic activity is always poor. We present here a surface oxygen plasma approach to directly treat CoPc for producing interfacial CoOx nanodots anchored on CoPc (CoOx/CoPc), which exhibits high activity towards both oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). The optimized CoOx/CoPc demonstrates a much better catalytic activity with a half-wave potential of 0.63 V and an average electron transfer number of 3.64 than the CoPc (0.59 V and n = 2.37) towards ORR in alkaline media. Moreover, OER performance of the CoOx/CoPc is also significantly enhanced, showing a current density of 22.2 mA cm(-2) that is 36 times higher than that of CoPc (0.6 mA cm(-2)) at an overpotential of 0.49 V. It is found that the enhanced performance of the CoOx/CoPc is attributed to the high electrochemical active surface area, highly active CoOx, as well as desired interfacial structure.

This unique structured catalyst allows the core material, NiCo2O4 nanowires, to serve as the electrically conductive skeleton, and the shell material, MnOx nanoflakes, to be the electroactive sites. As a result, the catalyst exhibits a superior electrocatalytic activity (eta = 342 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2)) toward the oxygen evolution reaction.

J	Liu, Jia-Lin; Huang, Yuan; Wang, Jian-Jun								Surface-adsorbed phosphate boosts bifunctionally electrocatalytic activity of Ni0.9Fe0.1S for hydrogen production								JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE				617				525	532		10.1016/j.jcis.2022.03.018				JUL 2022	2022	Development of efficient and inexpensive electrocatalysts for hydrogen production via water electrolysis is of great significance. Up to date, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is still the efficiency limiting step for overall water splitting. Here, we report a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst of 3D Ni0.9Fe0.1S : Pi nanoflower arrays for HER and OER enabled by surface-adsorbed phosphate. More importantly, the resulting electrode can also catalyze organic molecules such as ethanol and glycerin to be oxidized to value-added liquid products by replacing OER for hydrogen production. With the presence of glycerol, an electrolyzer assembled using the as-prepared electrode needed an ultralow potential of 1.49 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for efficient hydrogen production. This work sheds light on great promise of integration of oxidative biomass valorization with HER via earth-abundant electrocatalysts for yielding value-added products with lower voltage input and maximizing the energy conversion efficiency.

Products were characterized by XRD, ESEM, BET, EDS and XPS. The results show that pure perovskite LaNiO3 were obtained when the proportion of La(NO3)3.6 H2O, Ni(NO3)2.6 H2O and C6H8O7.2 H2O are more than 1:1:0.4. Their electrocatalytic activity at oxygen electrodes were investigated by steady polarization curves method. The results show that the electrocatalytic properties of LaNiO3 are signally influenced by the proportion of citric acid. Among them, when the proportion of La(NO3)3.6 H2O, Ni(NO3)2.6 H2O and C6H8O7.2 H2O is 1:1:0.6 or 1:1:3.0, bifunctional oxygen electrode has excellent catalytic activity on both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reactions.									0	0	0		0	0	0			1002-087X			INSPEC:9744435

Unfortunately, large overpotential is needed to overcome the sluggish kinetics of OER. With ultra-thin thickness, large specific surface area, rich and adjustable pore structure, and well-defined metal centers, two dimensional (2D) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely investigated for OER. By virtue of the desirable chemical composition and diverse structural type, 2D MOFs are also employed as precursors and sacrificial templates to prepare metal-decorated porous carbon, metal oxides, metal hydroxides, metal sulfides, metal phosphides, and so on. These 2D MOFs derivatives with high surface area and abundant metal sites exhibit excellent OER performance. Herein, the current advances on 2D MOFs and their derivatives as (pre)electrocatalysts are summarized, including the synthetic strategy and OER performance. Moreover, the structure-performance relationships and actual active species or sites of 2D MOFs and their derivatives toward OER are discussed. The current scientific and technological challenges and future perspectives related with 2D MOF and their derivatives in practical applications are also mentioned at last. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Carbon electrocatalysts, dual-doped with cobalt and nitrogen, were tested for oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions. Both materials show high bifunctional catalytic activity and excellent stability due to synergistic effects arising from the presence of nitrogen and cobalt. Electrocatalyst prepared by carbonization of [Ch](2)[-CoCl4] show exceptional activity and selectivity toward ORR. Conversely, electrocatalyst prepared from [Bmim](2)[CoCl4] showed a slightly better OER performance indicating that different catalytic sites are responsible for O-2 reduction and H2O oxidation. Parent CoO particles with graphitic nitrogen boost activity for ORR, while elemental Co supported by nitrogen atoms is responsible for OER activity. Finally, energy consumption during electrolytic oxygen production was calculated revealing energy saving when using two materials as anode electrocatalysts. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

However, these technologies have encountered significant challenges in terms of poor selectivity, high over-potential, low efficiency, and sluggish kinetics of the electrocatalytic reactions, which involve solid-liquid-gas three-phase interfaces (SLG-TPIs). In this review, we focus on discussing recent progress on the development of SLG-TPIs for electrocatalytic reactions, such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER/ORR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), as well as their applications in water splitting, fuel cells, and metal-air batteries.

The addition of the GDC interlayer significantly reduced the cathodic activation loss and increased the peak power density of the mu-SOFC by 33% at 400 degrees C. The peak power density reached 445 mW/cm(2) at 425 degrees C, which is the highest among the reported mu-SOFCs using proton-conducting electrolytes. The impressive performance was attributed to the mixed protonic and oxygen ionic conducting properties of the nano-granular GDC, and also to the high densities of grain boundaries and lattice defects in GDC interlayer that favored the oxygen incorporation and transportation during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the water evolution reaction at cathode.									37	1	0	0	3	0	37			2045-2322			WOS:000371020000001	26928192

In this article, reported are the findings in understanding and controlling oxygen defects in PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+delta (PBSCF) for significantly enhancing the rate of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are reported. Utilizing surface-sensitive characterization techniques and first-principle calculations, it is found that excessive oxygen vacancies promote OH- affiliation and lower the theoretical energy for the formation of O* on the surface, thus greatly facilitating the OER kinetics. On the other hand, however, oxygen vacancies also increase the energy band gap and lower the O 2p band center of PBSCF, which may hinder OER kinetics. Still, careful tuning of these competing effects has resulted in enhanced OER activity for PBSCF with oxygen defects. This work also demonstrates that oxygen defects generated by different techniques have very different characteristics, resulting in different impacts on the activity of electrodes. In particular, PBSCF nanotubes after electrochemical reduction exhibit outstanding OER activity compared with the recently reported perovskite-based catalysts.									153	8	0	0	12	0	154			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000481931200020

Subsequently, mesoporous nitrogen-doped CoSe/NC was prepared by solvothermal selenization. The obtained CoSe/NC is useful as highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions. Structures of the CoSe/NC material have been characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, N-2 adsorption desorption analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Results demonstrate the role of NaCI as efficient low cost template to form mesoporous nitrogen doped carbon, which could significantly simplify and reduce the cost of the synthetic procedure.

Herein, tremella-like Ni-NiO with O-vacancy heterostructure nanosheets grown in situ on Ti3C2Tx MXenes (Ni-NiO/Ti3C2Tx MXene) are fabricated via a facile strategy. Benefitting from the heterointerfaces between Ni and NiO, the synergetic coupling effects of MXenes and Ni-NiO heterostructures, the O-vacancies, and the unique architecture, the as-prepared Ni-NiO/Ti3C2Tx MXene showed superior activity toward the HER and OER in alkaline electrolyte, only requiring overpotentials of 72 mV for the HER and 248 mV for the OER to offer 10 mA cm-2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Ni-NiO with O-vacancies can effectively increase the electron density around the Fermi level and modulate the Gibbs free energies of the intermediates during catalytic reactions, thus accelerating the reaction kinetics.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000875500000001	36239342

The S-incorporation strategy enhances the electron transfer and wetting performance of NiFe oxyhydroxide, and dramatically improves the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. This catalytic electrode can drive a 1A cm(-2) OER with the lowest reported overpotential of 260 mV and stably drive a 1 A cm(-2), and a higher 3 A cm(-2) OER process in 1 M KOH. 3 A cm(-2) is the highest current density value recorded for a stably driven long-term OER process to the best of our knowledge. Inspired by the intrinsic OER equation, this study highlights that the conductive, large electrochemically active surface area (ECAS) and superwetting properties are important factors for designing large-current-density OER catalysts.									19	2	0	0	1	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000481578000008

In order to lower the energy cost, highly active and cost-efficient OER catalysts need to be used to overcome the OER reaction barrier, especially in neutral pH. Compared to alkaline or acidic electrolytes, pH-neutral or pH-near-neutral electrolytes are considered to be cheaper and safer, and water from rivers and the sea could be used directly under such conditions. However, OER under neutral pH is challenging compared to the OER catalysts for alkaline conditions. Therefore, OER catalysts for neutral or near-neutral pH have not been pursued significantly and, hence, there are limited advances in this area. Here, the progress made in the research and development of earth-abundant heterogeneous catalysts for OER in three pH-neutral or pH-near-neutral systems, namely, the phosphate system, the carbonate system, and the borate system, are systematically reviewed and summarized for the first time. Strategies to develop high-performance OER catalysts for neutral pH are reviewed and summarized. In addition, future challenges and opportunities in this field are discussed, which may shed some light on the future developments of earth-abundant heterogeneous catalysts for OER in neutral or near-neutral pH.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2366-9608			WOS:000584205200001	34927809

This process involves the growth of Cu embedded CNTs by low- and high-temperature chemical vapor deposition, post-treatment with ammonia for nitrogen doping of these CNTs, precipitation-assisted separation of NCNTs from cobalt nitrate aqueous solution, and finally thermal annealing for CoxOy decoration. Theoretical calculations show that interaction of Cu nanoparticles with CNT walls can effectively decrease the work function of CNT surfaces and improve adsorption of hydroxyl ions onto the CNT surfaces. Thus, the activities of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are significantly enhanced. Because of this benefit, further nitrogen doping, and synergistic coupling between CoxOy and NCNTs, Cu@NCNT/CoxOy composites exhibit ORR activity comparable to that of commercial Pt/C catalysts and high OER activity (outperforming that of IrO2 catalysts). More importantly, the composites display superior long-term stability for both ORR and OER. This simple but general synthesis protocol can be extended to design and synthesis of other metal/metal oxide systems for fabrication of high-performance carbon-based electrocatalysts with multifunctional catalytic activities.									72	3	0	0	0	0	73			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000395409200017

Here, first-principles calculations are employed to study the water-splitting oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on approximate to 1.5 nm diameter Au-13@Ni120P50 core-shell nanoclusters. Water splitting to produce oxygen proceeds in four intermediate reaction steps (OH*, O*, OOH* and O-2). Adsorption configurations and adsorption energies for the species involved in OER on both Au-13@Ni120P50 cluster and Ni12P5(001) supported by Au are presented. In addition, thermodynamic free energy diagrams and kinetic potential energy changes are systematically discussed. We show that the third intermediate reaction (O* reacting with H2O to produce OOH*) of the four elementary steps is the reaction-determining step, which accords with previous results. Also, the catalytic performance of OER for Au-13@Ni120P50 is better than that for Ni12P5(001) supported by Au in terms of reactive overpotential (0.74 vs. 1.58 V) and kinetic energy barrier (2.18 vs. 3.17 eV). The optimal kinetic pathway for OER is further explored carefully for the Au-13@Ni120P50 cluster. The low thermodynamic overpotential and kinetic energy barrier make Au-13@Ni120P50 promising for industrial applications as a good OER electrocatalyst candidate.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000434246300025	29766158

It is promising to produce and utilize all kinds of clean energy by using electrocatalytic reactions including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CRR). Suitable electrochemically active materials for working electrodes play a role in the catalytic effect. POM-based metal-organic complexes (POMOCs) exhibit advantages, such as a potential synergistic effect and high stability in aqueous systems, and can be used as energy-related electrocatalysts. In addition, POMOCs can further be taken as precursors for post-processing through appropriate approaches. Obtained Mo-, W-, and V-based composites can also be regarded as candidates for electrocatalysts. In this article, we classify and summarize the advantages and recent research progress on POMOCs and their derivatives as heterogeneous electrocatalysts in sustainable and clean energy conversion applications in aqueous systems. Besides, a brief overview of the reaction mechanism is also discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1466-8033		WOS:000830660000001

However, the practical application of Li-Air battery is currently prevented by the slow kinetic rates of discharge/charge reactions, which further results in many electrochemical problems such as high overpotential, poor cyclic performance, low current density, unstable electrodes, and electrolyte decomposition. Developing highly active catalysts in oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions is a hot research topic of Li-Air battery. Directly observing these reactions mechanisms is a challenging task since they occur in the interface between cathodes and Li_2O_2. The experimental techniques and first-principles calculations are used to reveal catalytic reaction mechanism and develop novel high active catalysts, which have become increasingly important. Herein, we review the interfacial interaction between catalyst and Li_2O_2 with the aim to make a correlation of catalytic activity with electron transfer, interfacial structure, and adsorption energy of O_2 and Li_2O_2. These discussions are helpful to reveal catalytic descriptor of ORR and OER, design catalytic surface structure and predict new crystal structure, and improve electrochemical performance.			高比能量锂空气电池是未来大容量纯电动汽车潜在的动力电源技术之一,然而由于充放电动力学速率低限制了其实际性能的提升,导致其充电过电位高、循环性能差、电流密度低、电极材料不稳定、电解质分解等问题。发展高活性的氧还原与析氧催化剂是锂空气电池研究的热点。单纯地通过实验观测过氧化锂在电极催化表面的形成与分解反应有很大挑战,利用第一性原理计算与实验相结合揭示催化反应机理、探求新型高效催化剂受到广泛重视。综述了催化剂与过氧化锂相互作用,建立电荷转移、界面结构、吸附能与催化活性之间关系,进而揭示了高活性氧还原与析氧反应催化剂的特征结构,通过催化剂的表面微观结构设计与晶体结构计算预测发展新型高活性催化剂,以改善锂空气电池电化学性能。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1674-3962			CSCD:5609566

Herein, we report a facile strategy to fabricate oxygen deficiencies-rich nickel/nickel (oxy) hydroxide hybrid films as efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting by in situ oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activation. Under OER conditions, the originally deposited Ni films from the ethaline-based deep eutectic solvent (DES) undergo a structural rearrangement with a phase transformation in the oxidation state from Ni(II) to Ni(III) at the surface. The change is coupled with an increase in oxygen deficiencies and a pronounced defective precursor is induced by the addition of nitrate ions, providing structural disordering and boosting the intrinsic activity of the catalyst, which strongly enhances the water splitting performance.									20	3	0	0	2	0	21			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000450934400010	30225498

The current interest in regenerative fuel cells; or rechargeable metalair batteries, necessitates the concurrent development of acid-proof, non-PGM catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We present here a facile salt (LiNO3) -activation synthesis of N/M/O (M= Fe, Co, Ni) doped carbons catalysts for use in the highly oxidizing OER reaction environment (low pH solution), using readily accessible starting materials such as citric acid (CA), metal acetate, cyanamide (CM) as the carbon, metal and nitrogen precursors. The effects of LiNO3, CA, heat treatment temperature and the type of metal on the structure, active sites and the OER activity of the catalysts were systematically examined. The results showed that the current densities of N/Fe/O and N/Ni/O doped carbons could be as high as similar to 9 mA/cm2 at the voltage limit of 1.8 V, while the N/Co/O doped carbon delivered better stability in the acid solution.									36	3	0	0	0	0	36			2405-8297			WOS:000399336600016

However, the inherent high reaction energy barrier and four-electron reaction mechanism of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) lead to large reaction overpotential, slow reaction rate and high energy consumption, resulting in low hydrogen evolution efficiency of the cathodic half-reaction, which greatly limits its practical application. Ni3S2 has a heazlewoodite structure. Due to the inherent Ni-Ni metal network, it has near-metal conductivity, which has attracted great attention in the application of electrocatalytic OER. Therefore, this article reviews the application of Ni3S2 and its composites in OER. The composition, structure and electrochemical catalytic performance were systematically summarized. It can be believed that Ni3S2-based materials will have a wide application prospect as OER electrocatalysts in the future. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst is expensive and not stable; graphene is a good candidate for electrocatalysis but has low activity due to few active sites. Herein, we dope boron (B) and transitional metal ruthenium (Ru) on graphene to obtain Ru@BG bifunctional electrocatalysts, which show good performances with increment E of 0.83 V and 0.85 V for 10%Ru@BG and 6%Ru@BG, respectively. Both of 6%Ru@BG and 10%Ru@BG have high half-wave potential of 0.81 V, which are only more negative by 10 mV than Pt/C electrocatalyst. In addition, 10%Ru@BG shows good stability as well as methanol tolerance, which are much superior to Pt/C electrocatalyst.

Herein, we report a simple and effective hydrothermal method to synthesize a three-dimensional (3D) marigold-like cobalt-molybdenum layered double hydroxide (CoMo-LDH) flowers assembled by two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin nanosheets. Especially, the main difference with the previous reports of 2D CoMo-LDH nanosheets is the fact that the present 3D CoMo-LDH catalyst with high dense feature provide abundant active sites for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution. Among the synthesized various Co/Mo ratios of LDHs (Co1Mo4, Co2Mo3, Co3Mo2, and Co4Mo1), the Co3Mo2-LDH exhibits the superior OER activity, delivering small overpotential of 266 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with low Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, Co3Mo2-LDH also show remarkable HER activity offering low overpotential of 325 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), which outperforms the commercial Pt/C. Co3Mo2-LDH catalyst also demonstrates the excellent stability over 12 h. The enhanced OER and HER activity of Co3Mo2-LDH can be attributed to its high electrochemical surface area, inherent layered 2D structure, synergistic effects of Co and Mo metal atoms, and compositional merits.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000620366000005

Polyelemental nanomaterials are attractive as multifunctional catalysts due to their wide compositions and synergistic properties. However, controlled synthesis of polyelemental nanomaterials is difficult due to their complex composition. Herein, a one-step synthetic strategy is presented to fabricate a hierarchical polyelemental nanomaterial, which contains ultrasmall precious metal nanoparticles (IrPt, approximate to 5 nm) anchored on spinel-structure transition metal oxide nanoparticles. The polyelemental nanoparticles serve as excellent bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The mass catalytic activity of the polyelemental nanoparticles is 7-times higher than that of Pt in ORR and 28-times that of Ir in OER at the same overpotentials, demonstrating the high activity of the bifunctional electrocatalyst. This outstanding performance is attributed to the controlled multiple elemental composition, mixed chemical states, and large electroactive surface area. The hierarchical nanostructure and polyelemental design of these nanoparticles offer a general and powerful alternative material for catalysis, solar cells, and more.									31	3	0	0	2	0	32			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000531811000001

Physical-chemical characterization of the newly prepared material demonstrated that NaCl can be effective as a porous structure forming template during carbonization. Resulting mesoporous structure containing FeNx species provides significant number of ORR and OER active sites. The optimized catalyst displays higher limiting current density and more positive half-wave potential for ORR than commercial Pt/C, as well as lower overpotential for OER than RuO2 in KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, the obtained carbon material used as an air cathode in a specially assembled rechargeable Zn-air cell demonstrates electrocatalytic performance superior to those of Pt/C and RuO2 electrodes, which makes it a promising nonprecious metal bifunctional catalyst for Zn-air batteries.

The compositional modulation of Co and Mo produces the highly active catalysts, Co(0.75)Mo(0.25)S(x)for OER and Co(0.40)Mo(0.60)S(x)for HER. Moreover, the potentiality of Fe incorporation in CoMoS(x)is demonstrated in enhancing the OER performance of the catalyst. The best catalyst for OER (Fe0.05Co0.70Mo0.25Sx) achieves a current of 10 mA cm(-2)at an overpotential (eta(10)) of 227 mV (1.457 V vs RHE) while that for HER (Co0.40Mo0.60Sx) requires only 130 mV (-0.13 V vs. RHE) of eta(10). The holistic enhancement of the OER kinetics is attributed to the facile generation of CoOOH in the co-existence of Fe at oxidation states >=+3, and Mo at +6 and +5 states. Finally, a complete water electrolyser is demonstrated using Fe(0.05)Co(0.70)Mo(0.25)S(x)as the anode and Co(0.40)Mo(0.60)S(x)as the cathode.									6	0	0	0	1	0	5			2196-0216			WOS:000548290600005

Here, ternary necklace-like CoP2xSe2(1-x) nanowire arrays are synthesized via simultaneously phosphorizing and selenizing Co(OH)(2) nanowires. Owing to the substitution of the P atom in the ternary system, the optimal electronic structure of CoP2xSe2(1-x) can be obtained and the stability can also be enhanced for hydrogen evolution. Thus, the ternary CoP2xSe2(1-x) NWs are highly active for electrochemical hydrogen evolution in both acidic and alkaline media, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm (-2) at overpotentials of 70 mV and 98 mV, respectively. To realize the overall water splitting, we further performed the experiment using the CoP2xSe2(1-x) NWs as a cathode and Co(OH)(2) NWs as an anode, which requires a cell voltage of 1.65 V to afford a water splitting current density of 10 mA cm (-2) in strong alkaline media (1.0 M KOH).									65	3	0	0	0	0	65			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000397126000035	28267175

When employed as a cathode catalyst in non-aqueous Li-oxygen batteries, the Co3O4 NWs effectively improve both the round-trip efficiency and cycling stability, which can be attributed to the high catalytic activities of Co3O4 NWs for the oxygen reduction reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction during discharge and charge processes, respectively.									56	12	0	0	1	0	57			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000349956600019

Herein, the successful synthesis of porous nitrogen-doped cobalt pyrite yolk-shell nanospheres (N-CoS2 YSSs) is reported. Benefiting from the abundant porosity of the porous yolk-shell structure and unique electronic properties by nitrogen doping, the as-prepared N-CoS2 YSSs possess more exposed active surface, thus giving rise to superior activity for reversible oxygen electrocatalysis and outstanding cycling stability (more than 165 h at 10 mA cm(-2)) in ZABs, exceeding the commercial Pt/C and RuO2 hybrid catalysts. Moreover, the assembled ZABs, delivering a specific capacity of 640 mAh g(Zn)(-1), can be used for practical devices.

In this work, a series of CoxFe1-xF2 (x = 0.33, 0.50, 0.66, 0.75 and 0.80) with porous structure were prepared through low-temperature fluorination of MOFs precursors with controlled molar ratios of cobalt and iron and used as electrocatalysts for OER. Significantly, the Co0.66Fe0.33F2 exhibited the most excellent OER catalytic performance with a low overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 54 mV dec(-1). Moreover, it has an ultra-long durability of 50 h at current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) and 50 mA cm(-2), which is superior to most of non-noble metal and Ru0 2 electrocatalysts. The outstanding performance could be addressed to the porous structure and synergistic effect of CoF2 and FeF2 and in situ formed oxides, which could increase the active sites for electrochemical reactions and promote the proton transport and ion diffusion during the reaction process. This work proposes a brief and efficient way to design three-dimensional porous structure electrocatalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000691097200001

Although tremendous effort has been paid to transition metal (TM) material-based electrocatalysts, rational design and controllable synthesis of fine structures to fully utilize the latent potential of TM materials remain great challenges. We herein report a composition-tuning strategy to achieve rational structure control of quaternary Co-Ni-S-Se materials through a facile one-pot hydrothermal method, in which earth-abundant Ni is introduced into a CoSxSe2-x matrix to optimize the morphology and electronic structure of the quaternary electrocatalyst. Because of the introduction of Ni, this novel Co-Ni-S-Se quaternary system shows better catalytic activity for water splitting with Tafel slopes of 42.1 mV dec(-1) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 65.5 mV dec(-1) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively, compared with its precursor Co-S-Se ternary system. For stability, there is negligible fading after long-term electrochemical test. Our work not only provides a novel thinking to introduce nickel into Co-S-Se ternary system by a facile hydrothermal synthesis for electrochemical water splitting, but also this quaternary system realizes bifunctional catalysis and better electrochemical performance relative to the ternary counterpart.

Therefore, developing efficient electrocatalysts with high stability to boost oxygen involved reactions is particularly important for promoting the application of Li-O-2 batteries. Here, CoSe2@NiSe2 heterostructure with distinct heterogeneous interfaces was fabricated via deliberate interface engineering. The formation of heterogeneous interface promotes local fine atomic array distortion that can act as an additional active site of ORR/OER. In addition, CoSe2@NiSe2 with a distinct heterogeneous interface is favorable for the formation of built-in electric field during charging/discharging to enable electrodes with fast electrical transfer rates and reaction kinetics. Synergistically, the additional active sites brought by the fine atomic array distortion are highly conducive to the reversible formation and decomposition of the product. Undoubtedly, batteries with CoSe2@NiSe2 exhibit excellent discharge/charge capacity (3530.1 mA h g(-1) and 3485.6 mA h g(-1)), low overpotential (1.21 V) and excellent electrochemical stability for over 1200 h.									53	3	0	0	6	0	54			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000532784000015

Particularly, the reaction at the anode side, namely the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), requires a high overpotential associated with O-O bond formation, which dominates the energy-efficiency of the whole process. Activating the anionic redox chemistry of oxygen in metal oxides, which involves the formation of superoxo/peroxo-like (O-2)(n)(-), commonly occurs in most highly active catalysts during the OER process. In this study, a highly active catalyst is designed: electrochemically delithiated LiNiO2, which facilitates the formation of superoxo/peroxo-like (O-2)(n)(-)species, i.e., NiOO*, for enhancing OER activity. The OER-induced surface reconstruction builds an adaptive heterojunction, where NiOOH grows on delithiated LiNiO2(delithiated-LiNiO2/NiOOH). At this junction, the lithium vacancies within the delithiated LiNiO(2)optimize the electronic structure of the surface NiOOH to form stable NiOO* species, which enables better OER activity. This finding provides new insight for designing highly active catalysts with stable superoxo-like/peroxo-like (O-2)(n)(-)for water oxidation.									68	2	0	0	0	0	67			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000541473600001	32567128

The OER is critical for a variety of electrochemical energy devices such as water electrolyzers, metal-air batteries, CO2 reduction, and electrosynthesis of ammonia. Compared to extensively studied metal oxide catalysts, graphitized carbon catalysts have been newly emerged as promising OER catalysts especially in less corrosive alkaline media, due to their low cost, high electrical conductivity, unique physicochemical properties, and excellent electrocatalytic performances. In this review, we discussed recent advances in nanostructured carbon electrocatalysts. At first, metal-free OER carbon electrocatalysts including single- and multi-heteroatom doping and edge- and defect-rich defects are introduced. Then, transition metal and heteroatom co-doped nanocarbons are summarized including Co-N-C, Ni-N-C, and Fe-N-C. In addition, carbon based hybrid electrocatalysts are highlighted, which include carbon based transition metal nitrides (TMNx), sulfides (TMSx), and selenides (TMSex), and phosphides (TMPx). Finally, current challenges and perspective for future research on carbon-based OER catalysts are outlined.									48	5	0	0	3	0	48			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000497217300001

During the last decade, single-atom catalysts (SACs) deposited on carbon nitrides have been a rising star as superior electrocatalysts for ORR and OER. However, either experiments or theoretical simulations cannot screen all the possible SACs at a high speed and low cost. Herein, with the aid of density functional theory (DFT), machine learning (ML) and cross validation scheme, the best performing ML models (root mean square error = 0.24 V/0.23 V for ORR/OER) are established and implemented to describe the underlying pattern of easily obtainable physical and chemical properties and the ORR/OER overpotentials of carbon-nitride-related SACs. The best SACs recommended by the ML models are further verified by DFT calculations to confirm the reliability and accuracy of models. Three promising oxygen electrocatalysts with higher activity than noble metals are identified including RhPc, Co-N-C, and Rh-C4N3. The electron number of d orbital of the metal active site is determined as the most effective descriptor by further model analysis. Finally, the universal mathematical expressions which can accurately predict the catalytic activity of carbon-nitride-related SACs without DFT calculations and ML process are obtained. The revolutionary DFT-ML hybrid scheme opens a new avenue of rational and low-cost design principles of desirable catalysts and even the exploration of recondite activity origin in an interdisciplinary view.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000822547400005

Herein, we demonstrate a "poor sulfur " route to synthesize surface electron-deficient Co9S8 nanoarrays, where the binding energy (BE) of Co metal center is considerably higher than all reported Co9S8-based electrocatalysts. The resulting Co9S8 electrocatalysts only require the overpotentials (eta) of 265 and 326 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) with a low Tafel slope of 56 mV dec(-1) and a 60 h-lasting stability in alkaline media. The OER kinetics are greatly expedited with a low reaction activation energy of 27.9 kJ mol(-1) as well as abundant OOH* key intermediates (24%), thus exhibiting excellent catalytic performances. The surface electron-deficient engineering gives an available strategy to improve the catalytic activity of other advanced non-noble electrocatalysts.

The synergistic effect of heterostructure and abundant active sites make the catalyst exhibits excellent performance in alkaline solution, especially at high current. Specifically, at 200 mA cm(-2) current density, the MoS2/NiS-Ni3S2 composite exhibits small overpotential of 181 mV and Tafel slope of 70.0 mV dec(-1) for hydrogen evolution reaction, and low overpotential of 460 mV and Tafel slope of 30.3 mV dec(-1) for oxygen evolution reaction. Moreover, MoS2/NiS-Ni3S2 can run stably for 12 h at 200 mA cm(-2) current density without obvious fluctuation, showing excellent durability. Meanwhile, MoS2/NiS-Ni3S2 as an electrolyzer achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.49 V, without decay after a durability test of 12 h. These superior properties of the MoS2/NiS-Ni3S2 make it become a powerful competitor for the high activity bifunctional non-noble-metal electrocatalysts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, we successfully prepared an electrode material by growing phosphorus-doped Ni3S2 (PNi3S2) on nickel foam substrate (NF) under hydrothermal conditions. The phosphorus-doping has an obvious effect on the morphology of Ni3S2 on the surface of the nickel foam, which probably results in more active sites, higher electrical conductivity and faster mass transfer. The resulting electrode material displays excellent electrocatalytic activities and stability towards both OER (oxygen evolution reaction) and HER (hydrogen evolution reaction). A relatively low over potential of 306 mV is required to reach the current density of 100 mA cm-2 for OER and 137 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER in 1 M KOH solution. When PNi3S2/NF was used in an electrolyzer for full water splitting, it can generate a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.47 V with excellent stability for more than 20 h.

The energy storage measured from the thermal dissipation yield during photoacoustic experiments and the yield of variable fluorescence are also protected to a significant degree (up to 30%) at temperatures at which oxygen evolution is totally inhibited. It is suggested that a cyclic electron transport reaction around photosystem II may be preserved under these conditions and may be responsible for the energy storage measured at relatively high temperatures. This interpretation is also supported by thermoluminescence data involving the recombination between reduced electron accepters and oxidized electron donors at -30 and -55 degrees C, The data also imply that a high concentration of osmolyte allows the stabilization of the photosystem core complex together with the oxygen-evolving complex. The stabilization effect is understood in terms of the minimization of protein-water interactions as proposed by the theory of Arakawa and Timasheff (Biophys. J., 47 (1985) 411-414).									68	5	1	0	61	0	74			1011-1344			WOS:A1996VF40900008	22872909	
J	Ouhbi, H.; Aschauer, U.								Water oxidation catalysis on reconstructed NaTaO3 (001) surfaces [arXiv]								arXiv								19 pp.	19 pp.						5 April 2019	2019	Polar perovskite oxide surfaces are subject to structural reconstruction as a possible stabilisation mechanisms, which changes the surface structure and hence the surface chemistry. To investigate this effect, we study the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the reconstructed (001) surface of NaTaO3, by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and compare it with the non-polar (113) surface of the same material. For the clean surface the reconstruction has a beneficial effect on the catalytic activity, lowering the minimal overpotential from 0.88 V to 0.70 V while also changing the most active reaction site from Na to Ta. Under photocatalytic conditions, the Ta sites are covered by oxygen adsorbates, rendering a lattice oxygen site on the NaO terrace the most active with a very low overpotential of 0.32 V. An alternative surface reconstruction stable in contact with water leads to an oxygen coupling mechanism with an overpotential of 0.52 V. Our results show that terraced surface reconstructions enable novel reaction pathways with low overpotentials that do not exist on other nonpolar NaTaO3 surfaces nor on non-polar surfaces of chemically similar materials such as SrTaO2N.									0	0	0		0	0	0						INSPEC:18918190

Since the experimental results have fallen short of the expectation of the optimal catalyst, the density functional theory (DFT) can provide invaluable mechanistic insights and predict promising catalysts. In this perspective, we briefly summarized the advantages of DFT in atomic and electronic structures for understanding electro-catalysis. Some achievements of DFT calculations were reviewed through some examples of the considered catalytic reactions (hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, and CO2 reduction reaction). Finally, we highlighted and analyzed the opportunities and challenges in DFT calculations used for electro-catalysis. On the road towards an optimal catalyst, the design of catalysts fused with DFT calculations promises rapid advances in the coming years.									29	2	0	0	1	0	29			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000496151800001	31651005

The redox behavior of Fe-Ni deposits prior to oxygen evolution could be generally related to their electrochemical activity for the oxygen evolution reaction meanwhile the activity of hydrogen evolution was found to be generally proportional to the mean roughness factor of deposits. Fe24Ni76, Fe76Ni24 and Fe90Ni10 deposits simultaneously exhibiting good activities of oxygen and hydrogen evolution were employed as electrode materials for water electrolysis in a bipolar hydrogen-oxygen electrolyzer in the stability test, examined at 50 and 200 mA cm(-2) in 5 M KOH for 2 weeks. The morphological, compositional and crystalline information of these three materials before and after the bipolar studies were measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, respectively. These studies demonstrated the potential applicability of these three deposits in the bipolar electrolyzer for water electrolysis. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Here we study the electrocatalytic properties of nitrogen doped graphene structures hosting four pyrrolic rings able to coordinate metal ions in a porphyrin-like configuration. The analysis is carried out by means of density functional theory (DFT) with hybrid functionals, employed to estimate the overpotentials of oxygen reduction reaction to water and hydrogen peroxide, as well as carbon dioxide reduction to carbon monoxide and formic acid. The competing hydrogen evolution reaction is also studied. We predict that Co- and Mn-doped structures exhibit low overpotentials for oxygen reduction to water, with the concurrent suppression of hydrogen peroxide production in the Mn case. Carbon dioxide reduction to formic acid is instead favored by Ti and Mn doping with overpotentials lower than 1 V, while hydrogen evolution reaction is disfavored.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2053-1583			WOS:000537339800005

Herein, the two-step preparation of a highly active oxygen electrocatalyst based on ultrasmall cobalt nanoparticles stabilized in a nitrogen-doped graphene matrix is reported. The catalyst performs as well as the commercial Pt/C catalyst in the oxygen reduction reaction, and better than the Pt/C catalyst in the oxygen evolution reaction. This particular electrocatalyst could significantly lower the overpotentials of oxygen electrochemical reactions in aqueous lithium-air batteries to attain a round-trip efficiency of about 79.0% at a current density of 0.1 mA cm(-2), thereby surpassing the performance of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. The good performance may be attributed to strong metal-support interactions, maximized by a high dispersion of ultrasmall cobalt nanocrystals in a nitrogen-doped graphene matrix, which yields electrocatalytic properties greater than the sum of its parts.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000394571100007	27739654

Surface-reconstructed ferromagnetic (FM) catalysts with a spin-pinning effect at the FM/oxyhydroxide interface could enhance the spin-dependent OER kinetics. However, in real-life applications, electrolyzers are operated at elevated temperature, which may disrupt the spin orientations of FM catalysts and limit their performance. In this study, we prepared surface-reconstructed SmCo5/CoOxHy, which possesses polarized spins at the FM/oxyhydroxide interface that lead to excellent OER activity. These interfacial polarized spins could be further aligned through a magnetization process, which further enhanced the OER performance. Moreover, the operation temperature was elevated to mimic the practical operation conditions of water electrolyzers. It was found that the OER activity enhancement of the magnetized SmCo5/CoOxHy catalyst could be preserved up to 60 degrees C.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000714779500001	34561927

The results indicate that the synthesis process is optimal when hydrothermal reaction time, temperature and the molar ratio of Mn2+/Co2+ are 10 h, 100 degrees Cand 1:3, respectively. Under this condition, Mn(x)Co(3-)xO(4) possesses an optimal electrocatalytic performance for OER. Moreover, after treated in the mixed alkali solution of 1 M NaBH4 and 3 M NaOH, the catalytic performance of MnxCo3-xO4 for OER has been enhanced furtherly. The unique architecture and its corresponding morphology after alkalization treatment, such as highly exposed active sites and high surface roughness, are mainly responsible for its excellent electrocatalytic performance for the OER process.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			2053-1591			WOS:000488094500014

A hybrid catalyst synthesized through a metal-organic framework-based process (M-NC-CoCu) enables an active trifunctional catalysis due to its multi-faceted favorable characteristics. It is believed that a range of catalytically active sites are formed through the approach including well-dispersed tiny CuCo2O4 phases, a high concentration of pyridinic and graphitic N, and Cu-O-x, Cu-N-x and Co-N-x moieties. In addition, a high-surface-area morphology with a high concentration of sp(2) bonding, which is beneficial for facilitated electron conduction, further contributes to the performance as an electrocatalyst.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000635278900001	33908948

The material requires a small potential (320 mV) to drive the reaction with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 31.2 mV dec(-1). Moreover, Co@HOPC shows better catalytic activity for OER than in situ cobalt-doped and surface cobalt-loaded hierarchically ordered porous carbon materials synthesized by traditional methods. This is due to the abundant surface cobalt species present in Co@HOPC and the material's good electrical conductivity. This work provides a new strategy to utilize functionalized silica microparticles as templates to synthesize hierarchically ordered porous carbon materials with metal-rich surfaces and efficient electrocatalytic activities.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2366-9608			WOS:000808244700001	35680607

Oxygen vacancies have been verified to be beneficial to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of catalysts. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of reduced CoFe2O4/graphene (r-CFO/rGO) composite with rich oxygen vacancies by a citric acid assisted sol- gel method, heat treatment process and the sodium borohydride (NaBH4) reduction. The introduction of graphene and freezing dry technique prevents the restacking of GO and the aggregation of CFO nanoparticles (NPs) and increases the electronic conductivity of the catalyst. Fast heating rate and low anneal temperature favors to obtain low crystallinity and lattice defects for CFO. NaBH4 reduction treatment further creates the rich oxygen vacancies and electrocatalytic active sites. The obtained r-CFO/rGO with high specific surface area (108 m(2) g(-1)), low crystallinity and rich oxygen vacancies demonstrates a superior electrocatalytic activity with the smaller Tafel slope (68 mV decb(-1)), lower overpotential (300 mV) at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and higher durability compared with the commercial RuO2 catalyst. This green, low-cost method can be extended to fabricate similar composites with rich defects for wide applications. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We considered selection for more optimal capacity for energy transfer as the most general pattern of evolution. From this, we propose that the etiology of complex disease is linked tightly to the evolutionary transition to cellular complexity that was afforded by the steep thermodynamic gradient of an oxygen atmosphere. In accord with this thesis, clinical studies reveal a strong statistical link between low aerobic capacity and all- cause mortality. In addition, large- scale unbiased network analyses demonstrate the pivotal role of oxygen metabolism in cellular function. The demonstration that multiple disease risks segregated during two- way artificial selection for low and high aerobic capacity in rats provides a remote test of these possible connections between evolution, oxygen metabolism, and complex disease. Even more broadly, an atmosphere with oxygen may be uniquely essential for development of complex life anywhere because oxygen is stable as a diatomic gas, is easily transported, and has a high electronegativity for participation in energy transfer via redox reactions.									6	0	0	0	6	0	7			1094-8341			WOS:000248841900001	17473218

In this work, we report a new hybrid electrocatalyst: iron-cobalt decorated nitrogen doped carbon/reduced graphene oxide-700 degrees C (Fe-Co-CN/rGO-70 0). The catalyst shows an excellent electrocatalytic performance toward HER and OER in alkaline solution, which has lower overpotentials of 0.215 V and 0.308 V at the current density 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, and this catalyst has an outstanding durability (after 45 h). The excellent activity mainly benefit from the highly dispersed iron/cobalt species, sheet structure with high porosity, the improvement of electronic structures with nitrogen-doped carbon and high conductivity of rGO. Combined with the density function theory (DFT) calculations, the improvement of the HER and OER performance were also attributed to the balance of adsorption/desorption of the hydrogen and oxygen-containing intermediates, and the increased electronic states density near the Fermi level. The proposed work provides a novel and simple strategy to synthesize a porous carbon electrocatalyst material using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as precursor with high activity and strong stability for HER and OER.

The findings indicate the existence of an effective synergy operating between amorphous CoB and g-C3N4, leading to the high electrochemically active surface area, low electrochemical impedance and charge transfer resistance. As a result, the CoB/g-C3N4 electrode requires substantially lower overpotential (360 mV) with a small Tafel slope (94.4 mV dec(-1)) as compared to bare CoB (103.5 mV dec(-1)) and g-C3N4 (140.2 mV dec(-1)) electrodes to generate the benchmark 10 mA cm(2).

As the single metal atoms are stabilized by coordination bonds with the substrate, the strong metal-support interactions can be exploited for ready manipulation of the electrocatalytic activity and selectivity toward target reactions. However, most single-atom catalysts (SACs) are prepared by pyrolysis and contain a wide range of coordination structures. Resolving the atomic configurations of the metal coordination moieties represents a critical first step in the establishment of an unambiguous correlation between the SAC structure and activity. In this Review, we summarize recent progress in the studies of single-atom electrocatalysts, with a focus on the impacts of the coordination structure of the single-atom sites on the electrocatalytic activities toward a series of reactions that are important for various electrochemical energy technologies, such as hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, CO2 reduction reaction, and so on. The survey entails a wide range of SACs, from noble metals (e.g., Pt, Pd, Ru, Ir, Au, etc.) to non-noble metals (e.g., Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, etc.), supported on a variety of substrate materials (e.g., pristine and doped carbon, metal, metal oxide, metal sulfide, etc.). Finally, the Review concludes with a perspective highlighting the promises and challenges in the further development of SACs within the context of coordination chemistry.									150	7	0	0	6	0	151			2155-5435			WOS:000551549800015

In this work, we report a facile method to construct alpha-Ni(OH)(2)@Ir core-shell nanoparticles as bifunctional electrocatalyst for acidic overall water splitting application. alpha-Ni(OH)(2)@Ir requires lower overpotentials (238 mV and 20 mV) to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic OER and HER catalysis compared to benchmarked IrO2 (332 mV) and Pt/C (36 mV); meanwhile, the OER mass activity at 1.55 V vs. RHE was 92 fold higher than IrO2; HER mass activity at overpotential of 80 mV was 5 fold better than Pt/C. The boosted catalytic activity is due to the enhanced utilization efficiency of Ir stemmed from the ultrathin Ir shell (similar to 1 nm). Moreover, 1.49 V is demanded for alpha-Ni(OH)(2)@Ir to attain 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic overall water splitting, 110 mV lower than benchmarked Pt/C-IrO2 system. Meanwhile, stable catalytic performance is recorded for 20 h.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000707037200038

In this work we have synthesized multiwalled carbon nanotubes MWCNTs along with graphene growth in-situ by CVD method at 650 degrees C on nickel-silica nanocomposites for OER in alkaline medium. After removal of silica, our material exhibited comparable OER performance with that of commercial Iridium supported carbon i.e. Ir/C (20 wt % Ir) electrocatalyst. The OER performance is attributed to the defective nature of MWCNTs in the form of surface discontinuities found on rolled graphene layers of carbon nanotubes along with MWCNTs-graphene interfaces which presumably contain dangling bonds as active sites for OER. The overpotential at current density of 10 mA/cm(2) exhibited by MWCNTs-graphene hybrid carbon nanostructured material was 310 mV in 1 M KOH solution at scan rate of 5 mV/s while commercial Ir/C material revealed overpotential of 305 mV under similar conditions.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000537564300091

The Fe incorporation effects are studied without structural and morphological changes due to the rigid framework of TiO2 based nanosheets. Transition metal doped titanate nanosheets are prepared by cation-assisted exfoliation of protonated layered potassium titanate. Fe incorporation within the lattice of Ni doped titanate nanosheets by co-doping stabilizes nickel ions in lower oxidation state by charge transfer effect, caused increased OER activity at Ni sites by the electronic interaction. In contrast, incorporation of Fe from the electrolyte, highly-active Fe sites at edges or corners of Ni doped titanate nanosheets are formed by electrochemical cycling in Fe-containing electrolyte rather than electronic effects on Ni. Through this work, Fe incorporation effects are experimentally revealed without crystal structural or morphological changes, and a method to produce a highly active and stable OER catalyst is provided.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2365-6549			WOS:000432225900018

The design of active and robust Co3O4-based electrocatalysts for overall water splitting in basic media is highly desirable but still remains a great challenge. Herein, a catalyst of a combined metal oxide heterojunction (RuO2/Co3O4) was synthesized by directly annealing a MOF-derived Co-Ru complex under an air atmosphere. The catalyst shows a low OER and HER overpotential of only 305 mV and 89 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution, respectively. It contains only a small amount of precious metal oxides, however, and demonstrates a better performance than most of the other Co3O4-based electrocatalysts reported at the present stage.									83	4	0	0	1	0	83			2046-2069			WOS:000393750100008

Here, we report a vacancy-richnickel hydroxide stabilized Ir single-atom catalyst (Ir1-Ni(OH)2), which achieves long-term OER stability over 260 h and much higher mass activity than commercial IrO2inalkaline media. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis certifies the obviousstructure reconstruction of catalyst in OER. As a result, an active structure in which high-valence and peripheral oxygen ligands-rich Ir sites are confined onto the nickeloxyhydroxide surface is formed. In addition, the precise introduction of atomized Ir notonly surmounts the large-range dissolution and agglomeration of Ir but also suppresses thedissolution of substrate in OER. Theoretical calculations further account for the activation of Ir single atoms and the promotion ofoxygen generation by high-valence Ir, and they reveal that the deprotonation process of adsorbed OH is rate-determining.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000801231700044	35451305

Herein, we investigate a new antisite disordered polycrystalline double-perovskite oxide Ca2FeRuO6 (CFR) material for catalytic activity. This makes it a remarkable electrocatalyst with excellent stability in a highly alkaline (1 M KOH) medium for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The bulk perovskite exhibits significant onset potentials of 0.9 V for ORR and 1.57 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for OER, creating a superior bifunctional electrocatalyst. The novelty enhances for trifunctionality as it shows a moderate onset potential of -0.19 V vs RHE for HER. Substantially, the present material efficiently accelerates visible-light-driven water splitting for OER at neutral pH with excellent recyclability. The photo-/electroactive perovskite is an exceptional example of a heterogeneous catalyst for multifunctional activity. A plausible mechanistic pathway for the synergistic effects of eg orbit-filling in perovskite oxides for OER, ORR, and HER activities is proposed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2574-0962			WOS:000621660800031

Herein, the synthesis of ultrathin nanosheet-based, hollow MoOx/Ni3S2 composite microsphere catalysts on nickel foam, using ammonium molybdate as a precursor and the triblock copolymer pluronic P123 as a structure-directing agent is reported. It is also shown that the resulting materials can serve as bifunctional, non-noble metal electrocatalysts with high activity and stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as well as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Thanks to their unique structural features, the materials give an impressive water-splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at approximate to 1.45 V with remarkable durability for >100 h when used as catalysts both at the cathode and the anode sides of an alkaline electrolyzer. This performance for an overall water splitting reaction is better than even those obtained with an electrolyzer consisting of noble metal - based Pt/C and IrOx/C catalytic couple-the benchmark catalysts for HER and OER, respectively.									380	19	0	0	12	0	383			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000380888600004

Iron oxides, such as LaFeO3, are particularly promising due to the favorable energy alignment of the valence and conduction bands comprised of Fe3+ cations and the visible light band gap of such materials. In this work, we examine the role of band alignment on the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the intrinsic semiconductor LaFeO3 by growing epitaxial films of varying thicknesses on Nb-doped SrTiO3. Using cyclic voltammetry, we find that there is a strong thickness dependence on the efficiency of electrocatalysis for OER. These measurements are understood based on interfacial band alignment in the system as well as catalytically active surface defect states as confirmed by layer-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and Mott-Schottky measurements. Our results demonstrate the importance of band engineering for the rational design of thin film electrocatalysts for renewable energy sources.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000739501900001

However, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a significant bottleneck that curtails large-scale applications of electrochemical water splitting technology, owing to its sluggish reaction kinetics. In the past few decades, various methods have been proposed to improve the OER kinetics. Among them, doping is a simple and efficient method to mold the OER kinetics of a catalyst by incorporating different or hetero atoms into the host lattice. These efforts are vital to design highly efficient OER catalysts for real-world applications. However, the OER mechanism of a doped catalyst varies, depending on the host lattice and the dopant. This review highlights different doping strategies and associated OER mechanisms of state-of-the-art catalysts, including oxides (noble metal oxides, perovskite oxides, spinel oxides, hydroxides and others), non-oxides (metal sulfides, metal selenides, metal phosphides, metal nitrides and metal carbides), and carbon-based catalysts (graphene, carbon nanotubes and others). Fundamental understanding of the doping effects on the OER from combined experimental and theoretical research provides guidelines for designing efficient catalysts.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000687807200001

In this work, a novel strategy of creating rich oxygen vacancy in Co3O4 is developed via cerium incorporation. The oxygen vacancy in Ce-Co3O4 not only promotes charge migration due to the formation of unsaturated coordination sites where electrons become delocalized but also acts as active site to anchor O-2 and Li2O2 thereby leading to synergic enhancement of ORR and OER kinetics. The low overpotential (0.9 V), large specific capacity (8250 mAh g(-1)) and extended cycling life of the Ce-Co3O4 based Li-O-2 battery experimentally confirm its superior bifunctional catalytic activity. This relationship between surface properties and catalytic activity established by defect engineering can serve as an innovative strategy for guiding the further development of high performance electrode materials for Li-O-2 batteries in the foreseeable future.									51	6	0	0	1	0	52			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000499066900087

Here, a series of lanthanide-contained 6H-perovskites with a formula of Ba(3)LnIr(2)O(9) (Ln = lanthanides) are investigated as oxygen evolution electrocatalysts, whose active subunits (i.e., face-sharing IrO6 dimers) can be regulated by the lanthanides in terms of catalytic activity. By using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we establish the theoretical trend in activity for Ba(3)LnIr(2)O(9) 6H-perovskites, the activity of which is correlated with the difference of adsorption free energy (Delta G(O) - Delta G(OH)) between O* and OH* reaction intermediates. We further establish a volcano curve between Delta G(O) - Delta G(OH) and the calculated O p-band center. Among the Ba(3)LnIr(2)O(9) 6H-perovskites, Ba3LaIr2O9 locates at the peak of volcano curve, and correspondingly is the most active electrocatalyst due to the optimal O p-band property.

The study indicated that the oxide roughness factor tended to level off with increasing thickness. Further, with an increase in oxide loading, the apparent electrochemical activity enhanced considerably at low range of loadings and then became relatively constant over a range of loadings. The higher loadings were found to be harmful. The layered oxide films (2.4-4.2 mg cm(-2)) prepared in sequential solution coatings exhibited greatest electrocatalytic activity in 1M KOH. However, the oxide electrode (loading: 3-5.7 mg cm(-2)) prepared by rotating spray pyrolysis produced the lowest oxygen overpotential-360 +/- 3 mV against a current density of 1 A cm(-2) in 30 w/o KOH at 70 degrees C. The oxygen evolution reaction at these film electrodes exhibited two Tafel slopes: 51-68 mV decade(-1) at low overpotentials and 120-140 mV decade(-1) at high overpotentials. The reaction orders with respect to OH- concentration were found to be similar to 1 for the layered and similar to 2 for the sprayed films. Based on the results, a suitable mechanism is also suggested for oxygen evolution.									64	1	0	0	0	0	66			0360-3199			WOS:A1996TQ13900002

The development of oxygenic photosynthesis spectacularly increased oxygen levels, and ancient life forms were obliged to develop additional antioxidative systems. We develop here the hypothesis of how "prototypical" bioluminescent reactions had a plausible role as an ancient defense against oxygen toxicity through their "futile" consumption of oxygen. As oxygen concentrations increased. sufficient light would have been emitted from such systems for detection by primitive photosensors, and evolutionary pressures could then act upon the light emitting characteristics of such systems independently of their use as Futile consumers of oxygen. Finally, an example of survival of this ancient mechanism in present-day bioluminescent bacteria (in the Euprymna scolopes-Vibrio fischeri mutualism) is discussed. Once increasing ambient oxygen levels reached sufficiently high levels, the use of "futile" oxygen consumption became too bioenergetically costly, so that from this time the evolution of bioluminescence via this role was made impossible, and other mechanisms must be developed to account for the evolution of bioluminescence by a wide range of organisms that patently occurred after this (e.g., by insects).									33	0	2	0	25	0	35			0022-2844	1432-1432		WOS:000168028500002	11343128

Nevertheless, the complexity of bifunctionality increases the difficulty of catalyst design. In this work, a hybrid of NiC2O4 and Nb2O5 is synthesized on nickel foam via a two-step low temperature reaction using Ni3S2 as a sacrificial template, named SNiC2O4-Nb2O5/NF. The experimental and theoretical calculation results illustrate that electrons are transferred from Ni to Nb, thus regulating the electronic structure of Ni. In the hybrid, Nb2O5 can effectively adsorb and split H2O, as well as downshift the d-band center of SNiC2O4, thereby optimizing the Volmer step. SNiC2O4-Nb2O5/NF achieves the properties for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER: eta(20) = 155 mV) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER: eta(20) = 293 mV). The addition of hydrazine to an alkaline electrolyte can decrease the cell voltage by 1.41 V when the current density is 20 mA cm(-2), and achieve a high-speed hydrogen yield driven by an AA battery. This work puts forward an idea for the rational design of environmentally friendly and effective hybrid catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000818023400001

The OER is an essential half-reaction with relevance to metal air batteries, fuel cells, and water electrolysis for power to gas applications. The renewable energy sector could benefit from the identification of surface morphologies that can effectively reduce the accumulation of bubbles on electrocatalytic surfaces. In this work, regular dimpled nickel (Ni) features were prepared to investigate how electrode morphology and therefore its roughness and wetting properties may affect the efficiency of the OER The dimpled Ni features were prepared using spherical poly(styrene) (PS) templates with a diameter of 1 mu pm. The electrodeposition against regular, self-assembled arrays of PS templates was tuned to produce four types of dimpled features each with a different depth. Enhancements to the OER efficiency were observed for some types of dimpled Ni features when compared to a planar electrodeposited Ni electrode, while the dimpled features that were the most recessed demonstrated reduced efficiencies for the OER. The findings from this study emphasize the influences of electrode surface morphology on processes involving electrocatalytic gas evolution.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2574-0962			WOS:000458705400046		
J	Yuan-Po Lee; Kwang-lung Lin; Ju-tung Lee								Electrochemical and corrosion behaviour of iridium-palladium oxide electrode prepared by electrochemical methods								Corrosion Science				35	1-4			387	94						1993	1993	Iridium-palladium oxide has been deposited on titanium substrate. The technique involved successful codeposition of iridium and palladium by a cyclic voltammetric method followed by a suitable heat treatment through which both iridium oxide and palladium oxide were formed. The electrodeposited iridium-palladium oxide shows different behaviour in acid and basic solutions in polarization and cyclic voltammetric measurements. The situation in acidic solution is more complicated. The large visible difference is mainly ascribed to palladium. High electrocatalytic activity and low overvoltage of the oxygen evolution reaction are the pronounced characteristics of iridium oxide. This iridium-palladium oxide film also has a high fraction of active sites for the oxygen evolution reaction, giving a Tafel slope of 0.48 in 1 N H2SO4. The results of the multicyclic voltammetric investigations indicated that the oxygen evolution reaction during electrolysis occurred beyond about 1 V and the iridium-palladium oxide is stable in the potential range below 2.3 V(SCE).

J	Raymond, Jason								The role of horizontal gene transfer in photosynthesis, oxygen production, and oxygen tolerance.								Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)				532				323	38		10.1007/978-1-60327-853-9_19				2009	2009	One of the pivotal events during the early evolution of life was the advent of oxygenic photosynthesis, responsible for producing essentially all of the free oxygen in Earth's atmosphere. This molecular innovation required the development of two tandemly linked photosystems that generate a redox potential strong enough to oxidize water and then funnel those electrons ultimately to cellular processes like carbon and nitrogen fixation. The by-product of this reaction, molecular oxygen, spawned an entirely new realm of enzymatic reactions that served to mitigate its potential toxicity, as well as to take advantage of the free energy available from using O(2) as an electron acceptor. These ensuing events ultimately gave rise to aerobic, multicelled eukaryotes and new levels of biological complexity. Remarkably, instances of horizontal gene transfer have been identified at nearly every step in this transformation of the biosphere, from the evolution and radiation of photosynthesis to the development of biological pathways dependent on oxygen. This chapter discusses the evidence and examples of some of these occurrences that have been elucidated in recent years.									10	0	0	0	9	0	10			1064-3745			MEDLINE:19271194	19271194

Herein, a series of transition metal adatoms are employed to tune the surface electronic properties of Cr-based MXenes with oxygen function group for realizing impressive HER performance. The Results show that the charge of surface oxygen atoms, which is affected by both the host metal atoms and the adsorbed transition metal atoms, play critical role in the adsorption strength of hydrogen. The optimal performance is achieved by depositing Cr atom on the Cr2TiC2O2 MXene, which results in the adsorption free energy of hydrogen very close to zero (0.03 eV). Systematic electronic structure analyses confirm that the charge transfer from the adsorbed transition metals to the neighboring surface oxygen atoms could tune the orbital occupancy of oxygen and their adsorption strength to hydrogen atom and therefore the HER activity. These findings and concepts may be useful for the design of advanced MXene-based HER catalysts. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Previously published theoretical results indicate that MXenes functionalized entirely with oxygen have lower G(H*) for HER. However, MXenes contain many terminal F groups on the basal plane, which is detrimental to the HER. Herein, the development of an ultrathin Ti3C2 MXene nanosheet fully functionalized with oxygen is reported for the HER. The obtained oxygen-functionalized Ti3C2 (Ti3C2Ox) exhibits a much higher HER activity (190mV at 10mAcm(-2)) than that of Ti3C2Tx (T=F, OH, and O). The improved HER performance is attributed to the highly active O sites on the basal plane of Ti3C2Tx MXenes. This study paves way for electrocatalytic applications of MXene materials by tuning their surface functional groups.									110	10	0	0	5	0	111			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000467235500010	30684300

Here, we developed a class of ultrafine metal-oxide (MOx, M = Fe, Co and Ni) NCs incorporated with iron phthalocyanine (FePc), MOx/FePc-G, supported on graphene as high-performance catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR). The high activities for ORR and OER are attributed to the electron donation and accepting ability of the highly redox active of FePc-G that could tune the properties of MOx. The FeOx/FePc-G exhibits an extremely positive half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.888 and 0.610 V for ORR in alkaline and neutral conditions, respectively, which is around 60 mV more positive than that of Pt/C. And NiOx/FePc-G shows similar OER activity with the state-of-the-art catalysts, Ir/C, and better performance than NiFeO NCs supported on graphene. Remarkably, the CoOx/FePc-G and NiOx/FePc-G show high activity and selectivity to reduce CO2 into CO with a low onset potential of -0.22 V (overpotential is 0.11 V).									24	5	0	0	1	0	25				2575-0356		WOS:000576642500001

The excellent performance with exceptional durability owe much to the synergistic effect between the Ni-Fe-P heterostructure and the outer oxidized layer.

The formation of the surface oxygen vacancies is measured by XPS, Raman spectroscopy, and TG/DTA measurements. The relative concentration of oxygen vacancies could reach 8.5 at% for the cubic oxide fabricated at a hydrothermal time of 3 h. In 1 M NaOH electrolyte, the cubic Co3O4 displays improved both ORR and OER activity with a total overpotential of 783 mV, which is close to that obtained by commercial Pt/C or RuO2 catalysts. The enhanced performance should be attributed to the increased oxygen vacancy defects as well as the desired Co2+/Co3+ ratio for the cubic oxide. This work may offer a possibility for developing other spinel oxides with high performance through hydrothermal-assisted defect engineering.

J	Li, Kaixin; Dong, Zhanhua; Lue, Zhe								Study of the bifunctional catalytic activity on Sr and Mn co-doped PrFeO3-delta Zinc-Air batteries cathode								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				430						141123	10.1016/j.electacta.2022.141123				OCT 20 2022	2022	Reasonable design of perovskite oxides with outstanding and durable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance is of vital importance to enhancing the performance of zinc-air batteries. In this paper, PrFeO3-delta and a series of Sr and Mn co-doped Pr0.6Sr0.4Fe1-xMnxO3-delta (x = 0, 0.2 and 0.4) perovskite materials were successfully prepared via a citrate-nitrate combustion process and used in rechargeable zinc-air batteries as bifunctional catalysts. The rotating disk electrode technique demonstrated the bifunctional catalytic activity of several materials in an alkaline medium increase in the order of Pr0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Mn0.2O3-delta (PSFM-82), Pr0.6Sr0.4Fe0.6Mn0.4O3-delta (PSFM-64), Pr0.6Sr0.4FeO3-delta (PSFM-0) and PrFeO3-delta (PFO). Compare to PFO, PSFM-82 displayed a greater peak power density (56.3 mW.cm(-2)) as an oxygen electrode catalyst for zinc-air batteries. The smaller discharge-charge cycle difference (1.03 V) of PSFM-82 after 135 cycles (135 h) at the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) also demonstrates its notably bifunctional activity and excellent cycling stability than that of PFO. The enhanced electrocatalytic property of both ORR and OER could be owing to the greater specific surface area, higher electrical conductivity and the coexistence of Fe4+ and Mn3+ ions with optimal electron filling caused by the partial substitution of Pr with Sr and Fe with Mn.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000863309800003

Non-noble electrocatalysts have shown their capabilities to practical catalytic applications as compared to noble ones, whose scarcity and high price limit the development. However, the puzzling catalytic processes in non-noble electrocatalysts hinder their advancement. In-situ techniques allow us to unveil the mystery of electrocatalysis and boost the catalytic performances. Recently, various in-situ X-ray techniques have been rapidly developed, so that the whole picture of electrocatalysis becomes clear and explicit. In this review, the in-situ X-ray techniques exploring the structural evolution and chemical-state variation during electrocatalysis are summarized for mainly oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). These approaches include X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The information seized from these in-situ X-ray techniques can effectively decipher the electrocatalysis and thus provide promising strategies for advancing the electrocatalysts. It is expected that this review could be conducive to understanding these in-situ X-ray approaches and, accordingly, the catalytic mechanism to better the electrocatalysis.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0033-4545	1365-3075		WOS:000537416000005

Here, we describe a catalyst that exhibits turnover frequencies higher than state-of-the-art catalysts that operate in alkaline solutions, including the benchmark nickel iron oxide. This new catalyst is easily prepared from readily available and industrially relevant nickel foam, and it is stable for many hours. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopic data reveal that the catalyst is made of nanoclusters of gamma-FeOOH covalently linked to gamma-NiOOH support. According to density functional theory (DFT) computations, this structure may allow a reaction path involving iron as the oxygen evolving center and a nearby terrace O site on the gamma-NiOOH support oxide as a hydrogen acceptor.									153	4	0	0	14	0	153			2374-7943	2374-7951		WOS:000462498900022	30937383

However, the utilization of active sites is still not satisfactory owing to the sluggish mass transport within their narrow pore channels. Herein, interconnected macroporous channels were constructed inside MOFs-derived Co-N-x-C electrocatalyst to unblock the mass transfer barrier. The as-synthesized electrocatalyst exhibits a honeycomb-like morphology with highly exposed Co-N-x-C active sites on carbon frame. Owing to the interconnected ordered macropores throughout the electrocatalyst, these active sites can smoothly "exhale/inhale"reactants and products, enhancing the accessibility of active sites and the reaction kinetics. As a result, the honeycomb-like Co-N-x-C displayed a potential difference of 0.773 V between the oxygen evolution reaction potential at 10 mA cm(-2) and the oxygen reduction reaction half-wave potential, much lower than that of bulk-Co-N-x-C (0.842 V). The rational modification on porosity makes such honeycomb-like MOF derivative an excellent bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst in rechargeable Zn-air batteries.									25	3	0	0	2	0	26				2589-0042		WOS:000571002600001	32777777

CoP nanoparticles anchored on N, P-dual-doped mesoporous graphene-like carbon (CoP@NPMG) acts as an outstanding bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the hydrogen evolution reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction over a wide pH range. The synthesis method of CoP@NPMG is template-free and simple, and all the precursors are easily obtained; both these factors contribute to the feasibility of practical large-scale fabrication. When employed as a bifunctional electrode, CoP@NPMG enables high-performance water splitting with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at cell voltages of only 1.58 V and 1.74 V in 1 M KOH and 1 M PBS, respectively. In addition, CoP@NPMG displays excellent catalytic stability at all pH values.									72	4	0	0	1	0	72			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000424075400049	29354815

In this present study, we adopt a facile electrochemical deposition method to synthesize the Li-doped NiFeCo oxides for OER in an alkaline medium. The scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmet-Teller method and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy provides the information of morphology, structure, specific surface area and electronic state of the electrocatalysts respectively. Investigates the electrochemical properties by the thin-film technique on a rotating disk electrode and in a single-cell laboratory water electrolyzer connects with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Among the catalysts under investigation, Ni0.9Fe0.1Co1.975Li0.025O4 exhibits the highest activity towards oxygen evolution reaction, and explains the activity by the oxygen binding energy; such knowledge can be helped to develop better catalyst. We achieve onset over potential 220 mV and receive 10 mA cm(-2) current density at over potential 301 mV with Tafel slope 62 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution. The results are similar to recently published catalysts in the literature. In water electrolyzer, the Ni0.9Fe0.2Co1.975Li0.025O4 modified nickel foam anode exhibits a current density of 143 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.85 V in 10 wt% KOH and a temperature of 50 degrees C.

Herein, to lessen the energy cost in full water splitting, the vanadium-incorporated MoO2-MoNi4 (VMoNi in short) hybrid nanoarray self-supported on nickel foam is prepared through a simple way. Compared with the Mo-Ni binary electrocatalyst, vanadium incorporation can obviously boost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity while almost keeping the perfect hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) ability, for it merely requires 202 and 17 mV for 10 mA cm(-2) working current density toward OER and HER, respectively. Furthermore, it displays outstanding performance toward full water splitting, merely requiring 1.45 V for 10 mA cm(-2) and 1.61 V for 100 mA cm(-2) in water electrolysis with keeping the voltage stable in tens of hours at 250 mA cm(-2). This work highlights the significance in large-scale hydrogen production from water electrolysis with the help of exploring non-noble materials, an important milestone in converting the renewable energy to hydrogen energy.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2168-0485			WOS:000705367800011

However, it has been challenging to disentangle the contributions from the two effects, which hinders the rational design of superior core/shell nanocatalysts. Herein, we report precise synthesis of PdCu/Ir core/shell nanocrystals, which can significantly boost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via the exclusive strain effect. The heteroepitaxial coating of four Ir atomic layers onto PdCu nanoparticle gives a relatively thick Ir shell eliminating the ligand effect, but creates a compressive strain of ca. 3.60%. The strained PdCu/Ir catalysts can deliver a low OER overpotential and a high mass activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the compressive strain in Ir shell downshifts the d-band center and weakens the binding of the intermediates, causing the enhanced OER activity. The compressive strain also boosts hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and the strained nanocrystals can be served as excellent catalysts for both anode and cathode in overall water-splitting electrocatalysis.									65	2	0	0	2	0	66			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000624621800001	33434387

Ascertaining that, metal-organic-framework-derived freestanding, defect-rich, and in situ oxidized Fe-Co-O/Co metal@N-doped carbon (Co@NC) mesoporous nanosheet (mNS) heterostructure on Ni foam (Fe-Co-O/Co@NC-mNS/NF) is developed from the in situ oxidation of micropillar-like heterostructured Fe-Co-O/Co@NC/NF precatalyst. The in situ oxidized Fe-Co-O/Co@NC-mNS/NF exhibits excellent bifunctional properties by demanding only low overpotentials of 257 and 112 mV, respectively, for OER and HER at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), with long-term durability, attributed to the existence of oxygen vacancies, higher specific surface area, increased electrochemical active surface area, and in situ generated new metal (oxyhydr)oxide phases. Further, Fe-Co-O/Co@NC-mNS/NF (+/-) electrolyzer requires only a low cell potential of 1.58 V to derive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Thus, the present work opens a new window for boosting the overall alkaline water splitting.									49	0	0	0	5	0	49			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000663163900001	34145762

The composition, structure, and morphology of the composite materials were investigated by XRD, XPS, and SEM analyses. The composite electrodes were studied as anodes for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 mol/L NaOH solution. The activities for the OER of the composites were explained by recording linear scanning voltammograms and Tafel plots. Results indicate that the onset potential of oxygen evolution at the composite electrode was lowered by approximately 160 mV compared to the PbO2 electrode without nano-Co3O4. The catalytic activity of the composite electrode towards OER was improved significantly. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu.

In this article, PBA@POM was successfully prepared with a Prussian blue analogue (PBA) as the initial structure. A facile hydrothermal process is reported for obtaining PBA@POM by etching the cubic PBA with a strong Bronsted acid, H3PMo12O40 (HPMo). The hollow cube structure not only exposes more active sites but also promotes electron transport, which results in excellent electrocatalytic activity for the OER. Compared with the PBA, which initially simply adhered to POM, the optimum PBA@POM hybrids display remarkably enhanced OER catalytic activity, with an almost constant overpotential of 440 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope (23.45 mV dec(-1)). The facilely prepared PBA@POM with good electrochemical activity and stability promises great potential for the OER.									31	2	0	0	2	0	31			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000478461600001	31246373

J	Zhao, Huining; Wu, Jingjing; Tang, Xin								Effect of Y-Ru-V-O complex on the OER activity of V-shaped RuO2 S103 nanotwin								PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER				637						413884	10.1016/j.physb.2022.413884				JUL 15 2022	2022	RuO2 is one of the most potential catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic condition. Nevertheless, there are twin boundaries, dislocation, vacancies and other defects in the experimental synthesis of catalysts, which caused lattice distortion and changed the crystal plane properties. In this study, we used density functional theory (DFT) calculation to reveal the effects of Y substituted Ru (Y-Ru) and Y-Ru-V-O (YRu and oxygen vacancy) complex during OER in RuO2 sigma 103 nanotwin (NT). Such structures exhibited that Y-Ru caused a lower over potential (eta OER), which is 0.41 eV. However, the V-o around the YRu atom decreases both the formation energy and the eta(OER). The theoretical analysis shows that synergistic effect of these two defects could effectively enhance the electrocatalytic performance of the RuO2 sigma 103 NT (110) surface structures. The d-band center of active Ru atoms on (110) surface is toward the EF.

J	Exner, Kai S.								Electrolyte Engineering as a Key Strategy Towards a Sustainable Energy Scenario?								CHEMELECTROCHEM				7	3						10.1002/celc.201902009		DEC 2019		FEB 3 2020	2020	Major challenges still need to be resolved on the way towards a sustainable energy scenario. A future vision comprises the development of electrocatalysts, refraining from using scarce noble metals, for electrocatalytic key processes, such as hydrogen and oxygen evolution and reduction reactions or CO2 reduction. Hitherto, the focus was set on the investigation of electrode materials, whereas only little emphasis was put on the electrolyte solution. Recently, it was reported that, under non-acidic pH conditions, the composition of the electrolyte solution has a non-negligible effect on the activity of electrocatalytic processes: this outcome puts forth the idea of electrolyte engineering, a promising strategy that, besides the study of enhanced electrode materials, should be put in the focus of future research investigations in electrocatalysis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2196-0216			WOS:000504515600001

In this work, worm-like Co5.47N decorated WO2 hybrids self-supported on nickel foam with carbon encapsulated structure [(Co5.47N-WO2)@C/NF] is synthesized for improving hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER and OER). The interfacial electronic structure between Co5.47N and WO2 can promote the conductivity of WO2 which in turn boosted the catalytic activity. Moreover, carbon coated and NF self-supported nanomaterials can mitigate the adverse effects of agglomeration. Experimental results display that (Co5.47N-WO2)@C/NF exhibited excellent activity with small overpotentials to drive current density of +/- 10 mA cm(-2) for HER (-36 mV) and OER (270 mV), respectively. It only needs a low cell voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting, demonstrating high stability with slight degradation after testing 80 h under 150 mA cm(-2). This study reports a novel strategy for designing low-cost and stable catalysts for electrochemical hydrogen production. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

It is shown that the electrochemically synthesized MLG can be used for the formation of noble-metal-free carbonized nanocomposite Co-N-C electrocatalysts of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Such poly-2,6-diaminopyridine-based catalysts in aqueous 0.5 \M H2SO4 are shown to surpass their acetylene black-based analogues as regards their functional characteristics in ORR and HER and also are highly tolerant with respect to CO and methanol in the course of oxygen reduction. Based on experimental data, it is concluded that the predominant active centers in Co-N-C electrocatalysts based on MLG and acetylene black are of the different nature and that the same active centers are involved in ORR and HER.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1023-1935	1608-3342		WOS:000534253400001

The morphology was investigated via SEM and TEM, suggesting that the Ni@NiO@C nanocomposites have uniform and spherical core-shell structures. When the Ni@NiO@C nanocomposite is used as the catalyst in ORR, 90% of the initial current density can be maintained after 15 h in O-2-saturated 0.1 mol L-1 KOH at 0.3 V under a rotation speed of 1600 rpm. As a catalyst for OER, the highest activity overpotential of the Ni@NiO@C nanocomposite electrocatalyst is 380 mV (vs. RHE) under the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and the Tafel slope was calculated to be 55 mV dec(-1) by linear fitting. Electrochemical performances of the Ni@NiO@C nanocomposites used as LIB electrodes exhibited a long cycling life with a high capacity of 750 mA h g(-1) after 400 cycles under 200 mA g(-1).									25	7	0	0	0	0	27			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000416928000005

Here, a controllable pyrolysis route at low temperature is reported for retaining the confined effect of CN- ligands to metal cations during the whole pyrolysis process, thereby preparing high-surface-area cubes comprising disordered bimetallic oxides (i.e., Co3O4 and Fe2O3) nanoparticles. The disordered structure of Co3O4 enables the exposure of abundant oxygen vacancies. Notably, for the first time, it is found that the in situ generated CoOOH during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can inherit the oxygen vacancies of pristine Co3O4 (i.e., before OER), and such CoOOH with abundant oxygen vacancies adsorbs two -OH in the following Co3+ to Co4+ for markedly promoting OER. However, during the similar step, the ordered Co3O4 with less oxygen vacancies only involves one -OH, resulting in the additional overpotentials for adsorbing -OH. Consequently, with high surface area and disordered Co3O4, the as-synthesized electrocatalysts have a low potential of 237 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), surpassing most of reported electrocatalysts.									32	1	0	0	4	0	32			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000535299300001	32452633

The control of size and morphology has been done via the pH and varying hydrothermal reaction time. Transmission electron microscopy reveals the formation of similar to 20 nm CoFe2O4 nanocube after 24 h reaction time. As-prepared samples deposited over graphite substrate and used as a working electrode for catalysis. CoFe2O4 nanocubes offer better O-2 evolution activity in terms of current density (48 mAcm(-2)), lower onset potential (eta(1) = 260 mV) and overpotential (eta(10) = 430 mV) compared to nanoparticles. The low Tafel slope value (44 mVdec(-1)) of CoFe2O4 nanocube confirms the faster kinetics compared to CoFe2O4 nanoparticles.

Herein, morphology dependant OER activity of Co3S4 thin film electrodes fabricated using simple and cost effective successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method is demonstrated for the first time. The morphology of Co3S4 has been influenced by varying number of deposition cycles. The effect of change in morphology on the electrocatalytic properties of Co3S4 thin film electrode is studied. The OER performance of Co3S4 thin film is related to the morphology. The OER activity with an overpotential of 275 mV @10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 53 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH electrolyte is due to increased electrochemical active surface area, super-hydrophilic nature, and low electron transfer resistance of Co3S4 thin film electrode.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0947-8396	1432-0630		WOS:000517161800008

However, the doping process is inevitably accompanied by the introduction of oxygen, influencing the heteroatom-induced asymmetric spin density over the active sites and leading to inconspicuous promotion in the property. Herein, by wiping off the undesired heteroatom-oxygen bonding, we maximize the heteroatom-induced improvement in oxygen reaction activity of metal site, providing descendant energy barrier and favorable reaction efficiency for zinc-air batteries. The proof-of-concept material delivers a superior halfwave potential of 0.88 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode for oxygen reduction reaction, a small overpotential of 410 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction, and a reversible oxygen electrode index of 0.76 V in electrochemical measurements. Aqueous zinc-air battery with such catalysts delivers an excellent power density of 162.3mWcm(-2) and superior durability over 635 cycles. Moreover, in consideration of high safety and flexibility of solid-state batteries, all-solid-state zinc-air battery adopting gel electrolyte is assembled and used to illumine an LED wristband, showing great promises for the next-generation energy system.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000537540200003	31978900

Herein, we utilized a one-pot hydrothermal method to prepare cobalt/nickel molybdate hierarchical microflowers on conductive carbon cloth (MMoO4-CC, M = Co, Ni) as three-dimensional self-supported electrodes for the oxygen evolution reaction. CoMoO4-CC showed better catalytic activity than NiMoO4-CC. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of a large active area, fast charge and mass transport as well as a three-dimensional conducting path, the CoMoO4-CC nanosheet electrode showed a large current density and a relatively low starting potential, delivering 10 mA cm(-2) current densities at an overpotential of 290 mV and a Tafel slope of 94 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, the CoMoO4-CC nanomaterial shows better electrocatalytic stability than IrO2-CCa, which could be a promising electrocatalyst for large-scale water oxidation.									40	0	0	0	2	0	40			2052-1553			WOS:000414779000003

Herein, highly efficient and stable bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) photoelectrodes are constructed for rechargeable Zn-air batteries. This work introduces a simple and efficient method for designing bifunctional ZnO/CuO composite materials with impressive photocatalytic activity, superhydrophilicity and excellent stability. Through the strategy of sunlight promotion, the ZnO/CuO photoelectrodes are used in the charging and discharging processes of Zn-air batteries, achieving low charge potential and high discharge potential of around 1.50 V and 1.28 V by galvanostatic charge and discharge, respectively. Under illumination, the short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage can reach up to 49 mA cm(-2) and 0.9 V, respectively. We revealed that this bifunctionality is originated from the valence change mechanism of Cu, meaning that ZnO/Cu2O and ZnO/CuO play the photoelectric catalytic roles in charge and discharge processes, respectively. This work paves the way to introduce a facile and efficient method for the development of integrated single-cell photo-assisted Zn-air batteries.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000774551100005

Herein, we report the synthesis of porous graphene with different pore size architectures as cathode catalysts for Li-O-2 batteries. Porous graphene materials exhibited significantly higher discharge capacities than that of nonporous graphene. Furthermore, porous graphene with pore diameter around 250 nm showed the highest discharge capacity among the porous graphene with the small pores (about 60 nm) and large pores (about 400 nm). Moreover, we discovered that addition of ruthenium (Ru) nanocrystals to porous graphene promotes the oxygen evolution reaction. The Ru nanocrystal-decorated porous graphene exhibited an excellent catalytic activity as cathodes in Li-O-2 batteries with a high reversible capacity of 17 700 mA h g(-1), a low charge/discharge overpotential (about 0.355 V), and a long cycle life up to 200 cycles (under the curtaining capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1)).

Herein, for the first time, we report a "rigid and flexible" material consisting of three-dimensional (3D) porous nickel-manganese oxide (Ni6MnO8) coupled with 1D ultrathin Au nanowires (Au-NWs) as an efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst, adopting alpha-naphthol-Au(III) as a precursor of Au-NWs and pre-formed Ni6MnO8 as a support. Ni6MnO8 acts not only as a robust carbon-free support that is stable in alkaline electrochemical conditions, but also as a highly active component for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), while flexible Au-NWs contribute to the excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and act as a flexible conductive electronic network. The coupling of Ni6MnO8 and Au-NWs plays a complementary role in the two types of oxygen electrocatalytic reactions. Accordingly, their advantages have been optimally harnessed while overcoming their deficiencies. Moreover, a Zn-air battery assembled with such a rigid and flexible air-cathode has lower charge and discharge overpotentials and a higher cyclic stability than those with a mixed Pt/C+RuO2 catalyst.									69	2	0	0	2	0	69			1884-4049	1884-4057		WOS:000442470400001

The electrocatalyst remarkably exhibits a highly positive onset potential of 0.99 V and half-wave potential of 0.86 V, both even more positive than the commercial Pt/C catalyst, and the current density is also greater than that of the Pt/C catalyst in alkaline media. A decent performance is observed in acidic media also. The electrocatalyst is extraordinarily stable to harsh environments. A promising performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is demonstrated by the electrocatalyst, while for bifunctional electrocatalysis a small overvoltage of 0.78 V is observed with onset potential at the lower overpotential of 300 mV announcing the advantage of its usage for practical energy conversion and storage systems.

The potential difference between the ORR and OER of MnCo2O4 is as low as 0.83V. By XANES and XPS investigation, the notable activity results from the preferred Mn-IV- and Co-II-rich surface. The electrode material can be obtained on large-scale with the precise chemical control of the components at relatively low temperature. The surface state engineering may open a new avenue to optimize the electrocatalysis performance of electrode materials.

In this work, the manganese nickel phosphide nanosheets (MnxNi2-xP) with a three-dimensional (3D) cross-linked structure in situ grown on Ni foam are developed and serve as a bifunctional electrocatalyst toward OER and UOR. The experimental and theoretical methods are employed to get a comprehensive understanding of the catalytic behaviors of the obtained samples. Compared with the monometallic phosphide, Ni2P, and commercial RuO2, MnxNi2-xP exhibits superior performance with the lowest overpotential and impressive longevity. MnxNi2-xP requires a small overpotential of 196 mV and an ultralow potential of 1.24 V to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) during the OER and UOR process, respectively. The theoretical consequences also confirm the benign electronic conductivity and efficient active sites for the OH- adsorption of MnxNi2-xP, reconfirming that MnxNi2-xP can serve as an effective bifunctional electrocatalyst for both OER and UOR.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2574-0962			WOS:000688250200117

Herein, for the first time, we present the interface engineering of novel MoS2/Ni3S2 heterostructures, in which abundant interfaces are formed. For OER, such MoS2/Ni3S2 heterostructures show an extremely low overpotential of ca. 218 mV at 10 mAcm(-2), which is superior to that of the state-of-the-art OER electrocatalysts. Using MoS2/Ni3S2 heterostructures as bifunctional electrocatalysts, an alkali electrolyzer delivers a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) at a very low cell voltage of ca. 1.56 V. In combination with DFT calculations, this study demonstrates that the constructed interfaces synergistically favor the chemisorption of hydrogen and oxygen-containing intermediates, thus accelerating the overall electrochemical water splitting.									978	50	0	0	38	0	984			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000377921300021	27100374

Herein, hierarchically structured yolk-shell Co and N codoped porous carbon microspheres (YS-Co/N-PCMs) have been successfully synthesized by using low-cost melamine, formaldehyde and cobalt acetate as raw materials via a facile template-free hydrothermal method and a subsequent pyrolysis. The formation process of the yolk-shell precursor is systematically investigated, involving a morphological evolution process from solid microspheres, ultrathin and wrinkled shells wrap, to yolk-shell structure formation. More importantly, the unique structure combines the favorable features towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), such as high surface area, sufficient Co-Nx and graphitic N active sites and suitable pore structures. As a result, the YS-Co/N-PCMs catalyst shows high catalytic activity for ORR in alkaline media for fuel cells, which not only outperforms commercial Pt-based catalysts in terms of resistance to methanol crossover and long-time stability, but is also better than many non-precious metal doped carbon-based catalysts reported previously. In addition, the YS-Co/N-PCMs catalyst also has high catalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Therefore, the YS-Co/N-PCMs catalyst may serve as a promising alternative to Pt/C catalyst for ORR and OER in alkaline media. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The discarded cigarette ash (CA) derived from the lighted cigarette is a major waste disposal and environmental pollution hazard. In an effort to turn dangerous waste into high value products, a facile and novel dual-templating (Mg(OH)(2)center dot 3MgCO(3)center dot 3H(2)O and ZnCl2) strategy to fabricate high oxygen-containing porous carbon materials (CAPC-X-Y) with nitrogen external defects engaging the discarded cigarette ash as carbon source is demonstrated. The nitrogen defects possess a positive effect on the distribution of electron density and surface condition, while the rich oxygen functional groups could provide surface wettability and extra pseudocapacitance. In virtue of both configurable and compositional superiorities, the high oxygen-containing (42.7 at.%) porous carbon materials with nitrogen external defects manifest remarkable performance for supercapacitors (SCs) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The findings shed fundamental insight on the design of dual function cost-free carbon for optimizing hydrogen evolution reaction and supercapacitor storage properties.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000675339400001

Cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry measurements for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) confirm the bifunctionality of the electrocatalysts. The electrochemical evaluation indicates that a synergic effect between Ag and Co enhances the activity through the fast breaking of O-O bond in the molecular oxygen to enhance the reduction mechanism. The high content of cobalt (Co) in the catalyst Ag/Co3O4-12, synthesized by second wave combustion, improves the activity for ORR, and the reaction mechanism follows a 3.9 number of electron transfer in overall reaction. The kinetic and limiting current densities of Ag/Co3O4-12 are maximum when compared to those of other Ag/Co3O4 catalysts and are very close to commercial Pt/C. Moreover, the maximum current density of OER for Ag/Co3O4-12 makes it a promising candidate for various bifunctional electrocatalytic applications such as fuel cells and metal-air batteries.									42	0	0	0	1	0	42			2470-1343			WOS:000438908600064	31458922

However, it still remains a challenge to synthesize bifunctional electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and HzOR with low overpotentials. Herein, we represent a N/S co-doped hollow carbon sphere loaded with Rh nanoparticles (Rh-NS-HCS) and demonstrate its dual appealing activities for both the HER and HzOR. Notably, the obtained Rh-NS-HCS shows superiorities for hydrogen production in OHzS with a cell voltage of 0.11 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) when it serves as both a cathodic and anodic electrocatalyst. These performances can be attributed to the intrinsic nature of the Rh nanoparticles and N/S co-doped hollow structured carbon matrix, which could provide easy access to active sites, excellent conductivity and stability, thus making energy-efficient hydrogen production possible.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13				2052-1537		WOS:000637619900018

However, as we approach the limits of performance imposed by scaling relations, finding active catalysts using computational methods needs to account for uncertainty within these methods. In particular, density functional theory calculations followed by thermodynamic analysis have been the main tool to rationalize trends in activity and selectivity of electrochemical reactions. In this work, we analyze this problem using three important reactions-hydrogen evolution, oxygen reduction, and oxygen evolution reactions. Using error estimation capabilities within the Bayesian error estimation functional (BEEF), we find based on distribution of adsorption energies for intermediates there is significant uncertainty in determining whether a material belongs to the strong binding or weak binding leg of an activity volcano. This results in bimodal (or multimodal) distributions for the predicted activity of high-performing catalyst materials. For example, there is only 75% agreement as sampled through GGA-Ievel with BEEF that Pt3Ni(111) yields higher ORR activity than Pt(111). To circumvent this issue, we approach this delineation problem as a classification task from both legs of the activity volcano. For each reaction, we identify a pair of reference catalysts on opposite legs of the volcano such that they have a similar predicted activity. By calculating an interval confidence value for a catalyst of interest to lie in the descriptor energy interval set by reference catalysts, we can assess whether a material exhibits higher activity than both references as suggested by activity volcano trends. For oxygen reduction, reference catalysts Pt(111) and Au(100) are well-established to lie on the strong and weak binding legs, respectively, and predict OH* adsorption of Pt3Ni(111) bound by both with 100% confidence. With similar reasoning, we choose several reference pairs for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution. By evaluating the best trade-off between the number of catalysts to distinguish and accuracy, we suggest that this method can be used universally to distinguish catalysts more robustly near the top of an activity volcano. This becomes even more important for assessing activity of multielectron electrochemical reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000626769100016

Herein, one kind of manganese phosphate-based electrocatalyst (Mn-x(PO4)(y)/NPC) with high specific surface area (1106.9 m(2) g(-1)) is prepared via a facile and scalable avenue, which possesses remarkable catalytic performance for the both ORR and OER, indicated by a more positive half-wave potential of 0.87 V in 0.1 M KOH for the ORR as well as an overpotential of 0.37 V to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH for the OER. Furthermore, the Mn-x(PO4)(y)/NPC assembled rechargeable zinc-air battery shows an excellent charge-discharge cycling performance, revealed by the smaller sum of charge-discharge potentials, comparable to that of Pt/C+IrO2.

The dynamics of the decrease in the oxidation rate, which were obtained in previous study by the change in geometrical size of the metallic part of the specimen, was reproduced both by the technique proposed and also in potentiostatic electrolysis at potentials below that of oxygen evolution, in some cases, depending on prepolarisation.									9	0	1	0	0	0	10			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000295988700007

Herein, a facile strategy to synthesize the porous carbon layers wrapped CoFe alloy (C/CoFe) through the pyrolysis of a homogeneous mixture containing Co, Fe ions and N-doped carbon quantum dots (Ndoped CQDs) was reported. The prepared carbon layers with multi-level pore structures provides more active sites and optimizes the homogeneity of the electron and mass transport. In addition, the carbon layers, which is doped by Co/Fe/N atoms, is responsible for high ORR activity, while the CoFe alloy plays a vital role in OER performance. The as-synthesized catalyst exhibits an excellent bifunctionality for electrochemical oxygen reactions, which is comparable to the commercial Pt/C and IrO2 benchmarks. Owing to the carbon layers protects CoFe alloy nanoparticles from the harsh environment, the rechargeable Znair battery with the C/CoFe catalyst delivers excellent stability during 20,000 charging-discharging cycles.

Electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are needed for a wide variety of such devices, including fuel cells, metal air batteries, and photoelectrochemical cells. Here we demonstrate a defect-rich NiCeOx layer, directly synthesized on a Ni substrate through a simple two-step dip-coating/annealing process, as a highly active and stable OER catalyst made from earth-abundant materials. With a low overpotential of 295 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and a stability of over 200 h, NiCeOx boasts one of the best performances reported in the literature. This good performance is a result of the large number of oxygen vacancy defects introduced into NiCeOx by the diffusion of Ni from the Ni substrate into a deposited CeOx film during the annealing step. The oxygen vacancy defects not only supply an abundance of active sites but also decrease the mass-transfer resistance, resulting in the large electrochemically active surface area and high OER performance. This work demonstrates the potential of developing defect-rich Ce-containing materials as robust OER catalysts.									69	5	0	0	2	0	69			2155-5435			WOS:000458707000085

Owing to its unique structural features, the BN-PCN delivers high electrocatalytic ORR activity with a comparable half-wave potential of 0.84 V and superior stability to those of commercial Pt/C. Moreover, the BN-PCN exhibits a smaller overpotential for OER in comparison with singly doped counterparts, suggesting that the structural properties of BN-PCN play important roles in imparting the electrocatalytic activities of ORR and OER. Furthermore, BN-PCN-driven Zn-air battery demonstrates excellent power density (193.6 mW cm(-2)) and high energy efficiency. This study offers a promising avenue for designing multiple heteroatom-doped porous carbon materials for clean energy conversion and storage applications.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000637755400002		
J	Li, Shu-Fang; Zheng, Jie; Hu, Liang; Ma, Yao; Zhao, Shuang; Zhu, Chuan-Hui; Yan, Dong								Sr-Doped Double Perovskite La2CoMnO6 to Promote the Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity								CHEMELECTROCHEM				9	15					e202200475	10.1002/celc.202200475				AUG 12 2022	2022	Developing effective electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for exploring clean fuels. Owing to the flexible structure and unique 3d electron structure, perovskite has been considered as a promising candidate for OER electrocatalyst. Here, we report a range of A-site partially substituted perovskite obtained via a facile sol-gel method, La2-xSrxCoMnO6 (x=0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0, LSCMO-x). LSCMO-x has been proved to have better OER performances. Therein, LSCMO-0.8 shows the best OER catalytic performance among these A-site partially substituted perovskites. The OER overpotential of LSCMO-0.8 catalyst is 0.39 V, which is reduced by 80 mV compared to parent perovskite La2CoMnO6 (LCMO, 0.47 V). The experimental studies have shown that LSCMO-0.8 exhibits a higher content of oxygen vacancies compared with LCMO, which may be the factor for the enhanced OER activity. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Sr doped in the A site can efficiently optimize the e(g) orbit filling. This work manifests that doping Sr into perovskites appropriately is an effective strategy for the improvement of OER activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000834120900001

One finds good bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of the four Ce1-xNixO2-delta electrocatalysts. The Tafel analysis of the ORR in the 0.57-0.78 V vs. RHE potential window leads to slopes in the 70-108 mV dec(-1) range. The number of electrons exchanged during ORR is between 2 and 2.7. The OER Tafel slopes are determined to be in the range 192 -281 mV dec(-1). OER activation energies are found to range between 28 and 43 kJ mol(-1). The specific capacitance of Ce1-xNixO2-delta electrocatalysts measured at a scan rate of 100 mV s(-1) varies between 0.7 and 1.4 Fg(-1). The results demonstrate that Ce1-xNixO2-delta nanopowders can act as bifunctional electrocatalysts for ORR/OER for potential application in the oxygen electrode of devices such as rechargeable metal-air batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2313-0105		WOS:000846367500001

The low performance of the catalysts is partially due to the complexity of the gas-involving multiphase interface required for the oxygen catalysis reactions, and it is often acquired only for a fraction of the loaded catalyst that is in direct contact with the 2D surface of the gas diffusion layer (GDL). A paradigm is proposed for extending the active region using an enhanced 3D multiphase interface on the cathode, which comprises abundant active sites with optimized hydrophobicity and reliable stability. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or the bifunctional catalyst is embedded into the bulk of the GDL and forms a semihydrophobic catalyst layer (SCL), whereas an auxiliary hydrophilic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst layer integrated onto the GDL assists to reduce the polarization during the cell charging and improves the cathode durability. An air-cathode comprising the SCL exhibits an overall performance superior to the conventional cathode counterparts including cathodes with metal-based catalysts, due to the enhanced and optimized multiphase interface on the cathode.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000626763700001

Here, we report an atomic layer oxygen defect cobalt oxides (Co3O4-x) nanosheets (1 nm) as efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Due to the atomic layer nanosheets, more oxygen defects are formed during plasma treatment enabling effective OER catalysis with overpotential of only 309 mV, which is lower compared to bench-marking IrO2 (313 mV). Meanwhile, a Pt-like ORR activity is achieved for Co(3)O(4-)x due to the atomic layer nanosheets with highly exposed active sites and loosened binding strength between Co3+ and O-2/OH center dot. The battery performance of Co3O4-x nanosheets is 1.7 times higher than that of Pt/C-IrO2 based ZABs. Besides, Co3O4-x nanosheets exhibit undetectable degradation in battery performance after galvanostatic discharge-charge with 5 mA cm(-2) for 150 h implying the superior stability of the atomic layer Co3O4-x nanosheets. All-solid-sate ZABs fabricated from Co3O4-x nanosheets perform an impressive power density of 57 mW cm(-2) and stable galvanostatic discharge-charge voltage for 2 h demonstrating that Co3O4-x nanosheets can be utilized as air electrode for practical application.

It is still disputed whether the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) may be competitive with the conventional adsorbate evolving mechanism (AEM) of the OER in these materials and, if so, under what conditions. Herein, we employ density functional theory calculations to demonstrate that the LOM can give rise to higher OER activity than the AEM at the active sites involving structural defects, both intrinsic and extrinsic. Specifically, we show that, although the AEM is preferred for the perfect (110) and (211) surfaces, the formation of metal vacancies due to catalyst dissolution may lead to much lower OER overpotentials for the LOM. Also, by screening several metal impurities in RuO2, we reveal that dopants such as Ni and Co can promote the LOM over the AEM even for the perfectly structured surfaces. Overall, we demonstrate that defective IrO2 is less LOM active than RuO2 that should contribute to its superior stability under OER conditions.									145	5	0	0	8	0	145			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500015

Firstly, three dimensional nickel cobaltite nanoneedle arrays with smaller diameters were directly grown on the thinner carbon filaments (CF) surface. Its derivative, the flexible NiCo2O4/CF-P is successfully fabricated by phosphating of NiCo2O4/CF. Promoted by the cooperation of small-sized effect and heteroatomic doping, the as-derived flexible NiCo2O4/CF-P exhibits the excellent electrocatalytic behaviors. When assessed as an electrode for the OER, the NiCo2O4/CF-P electrode illustrates a low overpotential of 191 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution, and a rapid kinetic speed with the Tafel curve slope of 83 mV decade(-1) slightly worse than IrO2 , but much better than NiCo2O4/CF (108 mV decade(-1)) and CF (142 mV decade(-1)). In addition, the as-prepared NiCo2O4 /CF-P electrode displays an excellent long-term electrochemical durability during a 30 h test. It is also found that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities of NiCo2O4/CF-P electrode are superior to those of NiCo2O4/CF electrodes, demonstrating that the nanoneedle arrays morphology and phosphorous doping are both beneficial to improve the active sites, enhance conductivity and facilitate electron transfer in the process of water splitting.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000571774900004

Herein, we successfully synthesize hollow iridium nanotubes NTs) with the rough porous surface by the 1-hydroxyethylidene-1, 1-diphosphonic acid-induced self-template method under hydrothermal conditions and investigate their electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution (OER) and nitrate reduction reactions (NO3-RR) in an acidic electrolyte. The unique 1D and porous structure endow Ir NTs with big surface areas, high conductivity, and optimal atom utilization efficiency. Consequently, Ir NTs exhibit significantly enhanced activity and durability for acidic OERs compared with commercial Jr nanocrystals (Ir c-NCs), which only require the overpotential of 245 mV to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, Jr NTs also show higher electrocatalytic activity for NO3-RR than that of Ir c-NCs, such as a Faraday efficiency of 84.7% and yield rate of 921 mu g h(-1) mg(cat)(-1) for ammonia generation, suggesting that Ir NTs are universally advanced Ir-based electrocatalysts.									48	0	0	0	3	0	48			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000526552100049	32125818

This study reports silver nanowires-zeolitic imidazolate framework (Ag NWs-ZIF67) composites as bifunctional electrocatalysts for OER and ORR. The synergistic effects of Co2+, organic ligands, and Ag NWs enhance the bifunctional electrocatalytic properties. Ag NWs improved the electrical conductivity of the Ag NWs-ZIF67 composite toward OER, and porous ZIF-67 on the exterior of this product enabled O-2 to fully react with Ag NWs for the ORR because O-2 molecules were easily deflected from a planar electrode surface.

Herein, we propose a novel and facile strategy to fabricate P doped CoS2 nanosheet arrays on carbon cloth (Co-S-P/CC) as bifunctional electrocatalysts toward hybrid water electrolysis, in which the tardy anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is substituted by a more favorable kinetic and thermodynamic ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). Benefitting from the abundant active sites of Co-S-P nanosheets and the robust adhesion between Co-S-P and CC, the binder-free self-supported bifunctional Co-S-P/CC electrodes have satisfactory electrocatalytic activities and stabilities toward the EOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Notably, owing to the more favorable kinetics and thermodynamics of the EOR compared to those of the OER catalyzed by the Co-S-P/CC electrode, the required cell voltage for hybrid water electrolysis (1.63 V) is remarkably decreased compared to water electrolysis (1.77 V). Furthermore, the oxidation product acetic acid is more valuable than raw ethanol or oxygen from water splitting alone. This work may broaden the horizons in exploring and designing novel electrocatalysts, which can integrate the HER with other small organic molecule oxidation reactions for multifarious energy-related applications.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			2052-1553			WOS:000587892200018

Taking advantages of strategically structural design effectively inhibits Fe/Co metal species migration and agglomeration during the pyrolysis process, deriving the nanoscale-dispersed CoFe2O4/CoFe active sites and abundant mesoporous structure which ensures more effective exposure in the optimized FeZn4Co@CNFs sample. With a half-wave potential E-1/2 of 0.84 V for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), small overpotential 0.36 V and 0.20 V for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively, FeZn4Co@CNFs presents the one of most Fe/Co-based trifunctional electrocatalysts reported to date, also is comparable to the benchmark Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts.

Remarkably, the overall water-splitting is successfully driven by FeZn4Co@CNFs-based Zn-air batteries for generating H-2 and O-2 bubbles.

Currently, nickel-based selenide materials are promising candidates for oxygen evolution reaction due to their low cost and excellent performance.

The as-prepared three-dimensional oxygen evolution electrode exhibits a small overpotential of 255 mV at 35 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 47.2 mV dec(-1) and keeps high stability during a 28 h measurement in alkaline solution. The outstanding catalytic performance and strong durability, in comparison to the advanced non-noble metal catalysts, are derived from the porous nanostructure fabrication, Fe incorporation, and selenization, which result in fast charge transportation and large electrochemically active surface area and enhance the release of oxygen bubbles from the electrode surface.									237	13	0	0	8	0	239			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000380968300024	27400679

Here, based on the idea that strains can regulate the electronic structure of the catalyst, an efficient bifunctional ORR/ OER catalyst Pt-doped Ti2CO2 (Pt-V-o-Ti2CO2) under 6% strain was reported using the first-principles calculations. Specifically, the phonon dispersion, structure, and energy calculation results proved that the Pt-V-o-Ti2CO2 keeps excellent stability under the strain range. Moreover, the d-band center of Pt atom in Pt-V-o-Ti2CO2 moving to the Fermi level with the increasing of the strains. In particular, the Pt-V-o-Ti2CO2 with solvation effects has the low overpotential of 0.41 V, 0.31 V and 0.72 V for ORR, OER and bifunctional ORR/OER under 6% strain, respectively, indicating better catalytic performance than landmark catalysts Pt (100) and RuO2. More importantly, the theoretical polarization curve of our calculation results can be more intuitively compared with the experimental results. Additionally, the Pt-V-o-Ti2CO2 has a significant inhibitory effect on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), ensuring the absolute priority of ORR and OER. Our research uncovers a highly active catalyst and guides the design and development of high-performance bifunctional catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000790053500004

In this work, the hierarchical Fe-Ni-Se/Cu(OH)(2)/CF with core-shell structural nanorod arrays were fabricated via the facile electrodeposition treatment after the self-supported anodization of copper foam (CF). The as-prepared catalytic electrode presents prominent OER performance with the low overpotential of 272 mV at the current density of 100 mA cm-2 and behaves the impressive durability for almost 58 h, outperforming most of the previously reported electrocatalysts. The obtained excellent activity could be ascribed to the unique hierarchical structure composed of the Fe-Ni-Se shell with superb conductivity and the Cu(OH)(2) nanorods core, which could establish the synergistic effect in the interface engineering and further increase electron transfer rate. Moreover, it is identified that the catalyst experienced the reconstruction of phases and microstructure during the OER operation. The produced oxygen vacancies and fluffy ultrathin nanosheets are beneficial to the reduction of reaction kinetics as well as the expose of active sites. Our study may pave the way to design noble-metal-free catalyst with rational structure and remarkable activity for water splitting in the future.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000797999400001

Herein, the fabrication of core-shell structured Co3O4@MOF-74 catalysts is proposed and realized with the tunable thickness of MOF shell layers, where Co3O4 nanowire arrays prefabricated on Ni foam are employed as the template as well as the metal source to react with organic ligands to achieve the MOF layers. Importantly, the optimized Co3O4@MOF-74 structures exhibit much enhanced catalytic activities towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER), requiring an impressively low overpotential of 285 mV to afford a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) together with a small Tafel slope of 43 mV/dec, as compared with the pristine Co3O4 sample. By investigating the Co3O4@MOF-74 structure after OER stability test, the conversion of MOF-74 into cobalt hydroxide shell layers is thoroughly characterized and confirmed, suggesting the in situ electrochemical conversion of MOF structures during the electrochemical process. All these results do not only uncover the changes in crystalline and chemical structures of MOFs for electrocatalytic reactions, but also help to comprehend and design novel MOFs as efficient and robust electrocatalysts for practical utilization.

In the present study, we prove that the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity in NiO nanosheets is effectively improved by the synergistic effects of N dopants and considerably porous structure. As an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the as-prepared porous N-doped NiO nanosheets exhibit good activities with the small overpotential and ideal half-wave potential, which is superior to Ir/C electrocatalyst. Besides, it is proved that the process of HO* being oxidized to O* is the OER potential rate-determining step; also the OER electrocatalytic performance of NiO can be markedly promote by the doping of N atoms using the density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, the fabricated Zn-air battery based on the porous N-doped NiO nanosheets also exhibits superior activities, outperforming many reported NiO-based electrocatalyst materials. Two series Zn-air cells with a voltage of 2.80 V can power a red light-emitting diode, which shows their large potential for various applications.									28	0	0	0	0	0	27			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000484073400037	31380619

Sustainability of the oxygen-evolving electrode determines efficient and economic hydrogen production. Using Ir derivatives in an electrolyte, we report an in situ catalyst regenerative deposition which substantially prolongs the lifetime of an IrOx oxygen-evolving electrode. Taking pH-dependent and reversible conversion between hexahydroxyiridate (IV) ([Ir(OH)(6)](2-)) and IrOx, an IrOx-regenerative deposition concurrent with oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is demonstrated. Time of electrolysis and overpotential of the IrOx electrode are studied as a function of pH of the Ir species contained in alkaline electrolyte. The regenerative deposition process is verified by ex situ cyclic voltammetry. The transmission electron microscope, zeta potential, and diffusivity studies suggest the prominent role of hydrous [Ir(OH)(6)](2-)-adsorbed IrOx nanoparticles in determining the efficiency of catalyst redeposition. Per the behaviour, a sustainable oxygen-evolving electrode succeeds in acidic electrolyte to exhibit an approximately 1390-fold enhancement in durability compared with a system without Ir species. Under the presence of the Ir species, lower catalyst dissolution rate is observed. The design offers an approach for efficient utilization of IrOx catalysts towards practical hydrogen production.

However, this strategy is limited in preparation of high-performance oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts. Herein we prepared Co@Ag bimetallic nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen rich graphene layers via pyrolysis metal organic frameworks (MOFs). The catalyst displays extraordinarily high ORR performance with a high onset potential of 0.989 V and a half-wave potential of 0.872 V in 0.1 M KOH. Moreover, it shows a superb long-term stability performance after 5000 cycles on account of the carbon layers that protect the material from corrosion as well as high methyl alcohol tolerance under methanol environments. Density functional theory calculations suggest that carbon atoms, which are adjacent to nitrogen dopants in Co@Ag@NC, are active sites for ORR Especially, Ag "mantle" in Co@Ag@NC contributes a great deal to tuning of electronic structure of carbon active sites, thereby promoting the activity of carbon atoms and enhancing ORR kinetics. This unique Co core/Ag mantle structure can boost the overall ORR activity of M@NG while keeping cost-effectiveness due to the very low requirement of Ag content, providing a new insight into design of other efficient electrocatalysts.									9	2	0	0	1	0	9			2168-0485			WOS:000449577200048

Herein, based on first-principles calculations, we propose that ZnO/BlueP van der Waals heterostructure can realize overall water splitting reaction for hydrogen generation. Strikingly, the band-gap of 1.83 eV is appropriate, and band alignments straddle the water redox potentials, ensuring the occurrence of hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Charge density distribution and carrier mobility exhibit significant charge separation and transfer. Visible-light response is improved compared with those of the isolated monolayers. Moreover, hydrogen evolution reaction is actually realized on the ZnO layer, while oxygen evolution reaction is implemented on the BlueP layer. Through the investigation of the adsorption and dissociation reactions of H2O, we observe that two neighboring H*s prefer to combine to form H-2 by overcoming a lowered energy barrier of 0.75 eV. Strain effect indicates that the lateral compressive strain of-4% to 0% and the vertical tensile strain of 0% to +6% can effectively tune band-gap and band alignments. The results indicate that ZnO/BlueP vdW heterostructure is probable highly efficient photoelectric material used for visible-light driven water splitting for hydrogen generation.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Hydrogen is a renewable energy carrier that does not contribute to CO2 emissions, and it holds the highest gravimetric energy density. It can be produced by the electrochemical splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules. Herein, we investigate the bifunctional activity of bimetallic oxide, sulfide, and selenide nanostructures in water electrolysis. Spinel-type, phase-pure NiCo2O4, NiCo2S4, and NiCo2Se4 with comparable morphological properties were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. The electrocatalytic characterization of NiCo2Se4 was found to demonstrate higher oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction activities (245 mV and 122 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2), respectively) compared to those of NiCo2O4 and NiCo2S4. Furthermore, a lab-scale water-splitting system was fabricated to examine the bifunctional properties of bimetallic nanostructures. A NiCo2Se4-based water-splitting system was found to require a cell voltage of 1.58 V, which is lower than that required by NiCo2S4 (1.64 V)- and NiCo2O4 (1.75 V)-based systems. In summary, this study explores bimetallic NiCo2Se4 as an efficient electroactive material that can be employed in various electrochemical energy systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), an aqueous pollutant, is degraded into F-containing fragments and captured to prepare ultrasmall WO3 decorated F-doped graphite sheets (WO3@F-GS) via a plasma-induced assembly method. WO3@F-0.1-GS achieves a low overpotential of 298 mV and Tafel slope of 77.6 mV dec(-1), as low as that of RuO2. Meanwhile, WO3@F-0.1-GS exhibits good stability in both OER and overall water splitting in 1 M KOH. The synergistic effect of WO3 and F enhances the electrocatalytic performance. Density functional theory calculations prove W4+ coordinates with F-doping resulting in enhanced adsorption of OH- and decreased energy barrier of OH deprotonation, leading good activity. The steric hindrance of F and WO3 loading hinder the stacking of graphitic layers and improve the stability. This work not only provides a mild synthesis strategy of F-doping, but also provides a novel reutilization approach for fluoride waste.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000850859400004

Herein, we report the facile synthesis of single-phase perovskite SrIrO3 nanofibers (NFs) and demonstrate that SrIrO3 NFs are promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in a wide range of pH. Single-phase SrIrO3 NFs were synthesized by electrospinning and subsequent calcination processes, and the electrocatalytic performance of SrIrO3 NFs toward the OER was evaluated under acidic, neutral, and alkaline media. A large surface area due to the NF morphology with an average diameter of 105.5 (+/- 15.5) nm led to enhanced catalytic activity of SrIrO3 NFs, representing smaller overpotentials and Tafel slopes under pH-universal conditions than IrO2/Ir NFs and commercial Ir/C. SrIrO3 NFs also manifested remarkably stable activity for continuous OER operation in all three electrolytes, even though a considerable amount of Sr was leached out of them. The long-lasting high OER activity of SrIrO3 NFs could be ascribed to stable Ir cations taking B sites of the perovskite oxide structure, known as an active site for electrocatalysis. The initial perovskite crystal structure of SrIrO3 was maintained for a certain time even after significant Sr leaching. This work is the first application of SrIrO3 perovskite for pH-universal OER catalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000832794500090

Herein, using the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as a probe reaction, we deliberately introduced base-soluble Zn(II) or Al(III) sites into NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs), which are one of the best OER catalysts. Then, the Zn(II) or Al(III) sites were selectively etched to create atomic M(II)/M(III) defects, which dramatically enhanced the OER activity. At a current density of 20 mA.cm(-2), only 200 mV overpotential was required to generate M(II) defect-rich NiFe LDHs, which is the best NiFe-based OER catalyst reported to date. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the creation of dangling Ni-Fe sites (i.e., unsaturated coordinated Ni-Fe sites) by defect engineering of a Ni-O-Fe site at the atomic scale efficiently lowers the Gibbs free energy of the oxygen evolution process. This defect engineering strategy provides new insights into catalysts at the atomic scale and should be beneficial for the design of a variety of catalysts.									60	4	0	0	5	0	60			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000441237100006

Then it gets the first-order differential analysis of polarization curves and acquires the critical hydrogen evolution potential and the hydrogen evolution current density of the steel bar. Next, the steady-state critical current density of hydrogen evolution was obtained by means of steady-state measurement. Results show that potentiodynamic polarization curves can monitor the electrochemical reaction process of the cathode. Before the abrupt point of the differential curve, the cathode reaction is dominated by the oxygen consumption reaction, and the hydrogen evolution reaction is the main control reaction after the abrupt point. With polarization curves, the steady-state critical current density of hydrogen evolution of the steel bar in reinforced concrete could be determined and thereby the probability of hydrogen embrittlement could be predicted. By this method, the steady-state hydrogen evolution critical current density of the test steel bar is acquired to be about 0.355 A/m2.									2	2	0	0	0	0	3			1005-4537			INSPEC:17983173

Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to validate the feasibility of a single transition metal (TM) embedded in defective g-C3N4 for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis. It was clarified that the TM atom supported on defective g-C3N4 with N vacancy (TM/VN-CN) was stable and possible to be synthesized. Remarkably, Rh/V-N-CN exhibited low overpotentials of 0.32 and 0.43 V for OER and ORR, respectively, and was considered as the promising bifunctional catalyst. The volcano plots and contour maps were established based on the scaling relation of adsorption energies of *OH, *O, and *OOH. The OER/ORR activity origin was revealed by descriptors of the d-band center and the number of d-orbital electrons multiplied electronegativity of TM. Furthermore, the machine learning (ML) algorithm was utilized to analyze the intrinsic correlation between catalytic activity and a series of structural and atomic features. Our combined DFT and ML work not only opts for the promising bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts but also provides guidance for the design of single-atom catalysts and the discovery of more efficient catalysts.									47	0	0	0	2	0	46			2168-0485			WOS:000627591900019

Amorphous oxide materials have found wide electrocatalytic applications ranging from hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution to oxygen reduction, CO2 electroreduction and nitrogen electroreduction. The amorphous oxide electrocatalysts even outperform their crystalline counterparts in terms of electrocatalytic activity and stability. Despite of the merits and achievements for amorphous oxide electrocatalysts, there are still issues and challenges existing for amorphous oxide electrocatalysts. There are rarely reviews specifically focusing on amorphous oxide electrocatalysts and therefore it is imperative to have a comprehensive overview of the research progress and to better understand the achievements and issues with amorphous oxide electrocatalysts. In this minireview, several general preparation methods for amorphous oxides are first introduced.

However, the underlying property of such catalysts that gives rise to their bifunctionality is not yet known nor explored. With the first use of near-infrared photoluminescence spectroscopy for tracking the changes in the individual metal cation valence states during electrocatalysis in combination with in situ gravimetric and resistance measurements, we show the underlying correlation between catalytic activity, potential-dependent resistance, and nature of reaction intermediates on various bifunctional and nonbifunctional surfaces. Our results show that bifunctional MnOx reversibly switches electrical polarity from p-type to n-type along with the formation of high-valent cationic Mn4+ active sites as well as low-valent cationic Mn2+ active sites during OER and ORR, respectively, which is absent in nonbifunctional NiO and Co3O4. Results also show that other key process steps such as lattice hydration/dehydration occur during polarization. These results are rationalized in terms of a band structure framework which correlates electrochemical activity with the formation energy of various metal cation intermediates.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000518703000039

The composite material features a remarkable electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance where the overpotential at 10 mA/cm(2) and the current density at 1.7 V-RHE are recorded as 0.274 V-RHE and 650 mA/cm(2), respectively, in 1 mol/L KOH. In particular, the activation of nickel-iron clusters from the MOF under an applied anodic bias steadily boosts the OER performance. Although Ni(Fe)-MOF-74 goes through some structural modification during the electrochemical measurements, the stabilized and optimized composite material shows excellent OER performance. This simple strategy to design highly-efficient electrocatalysts, utilizing readily available precursors and carbon materials, will leverage the use of diverse metal-organic complexes into electrode fabrication with a high energy conversion efficiency.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2192-6506			WOS:000671914900001	34251761

In the novel catalysts, the P atoms fill the oxygen vacancies, elevate the chemical valence state of Ni2+ and Co3+, and increase the hydride acceptors, which reinforcing the promoting effect of CeO2 in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Moreover, the negatively charged P atoms capture the positively charged protons more easily, benefiting the Volmer step during HER Furthermore, the synergistic effect between oxygen vacancies and the filled P atoms accelerates the migration rate of electrons/ions and increases the electrochemical active area. All of the above are advantageous to the hydrogen evolution of NiCo2Px/P(x)FVo-CeO2 in alkaline electrolyte. As a result, the overpotential as low as 33.6 mV is achieved for NiCo2P0.3/P(0.3)FVo-CeO2 in alkaline media to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The reactivity is superior to that of Pt/C at a large current density along with a Tafel slope of 61.24 mV dec(-1) and long-term durability, which giving a new technology for efficient transition-metal catalyst candidates toward HER in alkaline solution.									31	4	0	0	1	0	32			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000484831100097	31274294

Ni foam was coated with NanoCOT, a highly active material containing carbon, oxygen, and titanium. NanoCOT is synthesized and deposited on Ni foam from facile carbon thermal modification of Fe3+ treated P25 TiO2 nanoparticles in an atmosphere of methane, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Both the cathode and anode are prepared on Ni foam due to its high surface area and open 3D network structure. An alloy of NiMoZn was electrodeposited on Ni foam for HER. In addition to NanoCOT, electrodeposition of amorphous FeOOH was used to promote the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on nickel foam in this study. The enhanced catalytic activities of the as-synthesized electrodes than previously reported NanoCOT electrode on planer substrate are attributed to the nanostructured COT electrode material and high surface area of Ni foam.

Herein, we report the high activity of fibrous Cu-based catalysts. The synthesis process is simple and scalable. Electrospinning method was selected to synthesize fibrous polymer substrates (Poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene, PVdF-HFP), which are then covered by Cu via electroless deposition. Cu-deposited PVdF-HFP with different microstructures having smooth and roughened surfaces were also synthesized by drop-casting and impregnation method, respectively, to emphasize the importance of the microstructures on OER activity. The OER activity and durability were studied by linear sweep voltammetry, chronoamperometry, and Tafel slope analysis. The Cu/PVdF-HFP fibrous catalysts exhibit significantly improved OER activity and durability compared with Cu plate as well as Cu-deposited PVdF-HFP with different microstructures. The unique fibrous structure provides better mass transport, diffusion, and large active surface area. In addition to the advantages of the fibrous structure, attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR-IR) and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the improved specific activity for Cu/PVdF-HFP fiber can be attributed to the synergistic effect between Cu and Cu/PVdF-HFP (electron transfer from Cu to PVdF-HFP) at the Cu|PVdF-HFP interface, which results in optimized reaction energetics for the OER.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000485088200001	31433539

Herein, ZnO/Co3O4 core-shell nanorods are fabricated on Ni foil by a mild photo-deposition method to accelerate charge transfer between Co3O4 and the conductive substrate. The mild prepare method effectively avoids the oxidation of Ni foil and constructs p-n heterojunction between ZnO and Co3O4. Compared with sole Co3O4, the ZnO/Co3O4 core-shell nanorods exhibit larger electrochemical active surface area and smaller charge transfer resistance. Besides, the XPS results reveal that the strong electron interaction on nanointerfaces induces electronic structure modulation, which may bring interfacial charge transfer from Co to Zn, and further cooperate synergistically toward the oxygen generation in alkali solution. Moreover, the electrochemical active surface area of the ZnO/Co3O4 nanorods varies with the photo-deposit time and influences the OER performance. When the photo-deposit time is 4 h, the as-fabricated ZnO/Co3O4 nanorods exhibit excellent electrochemical performance with overpotential of 294 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1), and outstanding stability for oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline medium.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000495850900002

Herein, by nanostructuring and defect engineering, we enhance the catalytic properties of naturally occurring, but normally inactive ore hematite (Ht) by converting it to hematene (Hm) with oxygen vacancies (Ov-Hm), which becomes an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, being even superior to the state-of-the-art catalyst IrO2/C, with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a lower overpotential of 250 mV. First-principles calculations reveal that the reduced dimensionality and defects on the Hm surface locally modify the charge around the adsorption sites, which results in a reduction of the potential barrier in the OER process. Our experimental and theoretical insights suggest a promising route to the development of a highly active electrocatalyst from the naturally occurring and abundant material for OER applications.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000526953200026

We particularly focus on the dissociation of H-2 and O-2 on Pt(111) which represent important reaction steps in the hydrogen evolution/oxidation reaction and the oxygen reduction reaction, respectively. Because of the weak interaction of water with Pt(111), the electronic structure of the Pt electrode is hardly perturbed by the presence of water. Consequently, processes that occur directly at the electrode surface, such as specific adsorption or the dissociation of oxygen from the chemisorbed molecular oxygen state, are only weakly influenced by water. In contrast, processes that occur further away from the electrode, such as the dissociation of H-2, can be modified by the water environment through direct molecule-water interaction.

But CoFeCoO4 was not explored widely like ZnCo2O4 (or NiCo2O4) as the ORR electrocatalyst for its relatively complicated atomic site occupation. CoFeCoO4 has a typical cubic spinel structure with Co2+ in the tetrahedron and Co3+ and Fe3+ in the octahedron. A mixture of Co3+ and Fe3+ in the B site makes the oxide have a wider overlap between transition metal 3d orbit and O 2p orbit, which can lead to an effective charge transfer in the rate-determining steps of ORR process and then enhance the ORR activity. The high electronic conductivity and specific surface area of rGO can accelerate charger transfer and provide more catalytic sites, which would contribute to a faster ORR process. In this work, the porous spindle CoFeCoO4 microparticles which were synthesized by hydrothermal technology, were assembled on the rGO surface to obtain the CoFeCoO4/rGO composite, which exhibited enhanced ORR activity and catalytic stability comparable to that of Pt/C. On the other hand, the OER catalytic activity of the prepared samples was also studied to explore the potential of CoFeCoO4/rGO as a bifunctional oxygen catalyst.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1793-2920	1793-7094		WOS:000466876700006

When serving as both anode and cathode for overall water splitting, it requires ultralow cell voltages of only 1.47 and 1.77 V to deliver current densities of 10 and 500 mA cm(-2), respectively and exhibits ultrastability, experiencing chronoamperometric decay of only 6.2 % at an ultrahigh initial current density of 500 mA cm(-2) for 50 h. The outstanding OER performances may be attributed to formation of and synergistic effects between multiple active intermediates during the OER, as revealed with an in-situ Raman spectroscopic study. With an in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopic examination, the HER is identified to proceed through the Volmer-Heyrovsky route.									26	0	0	0	3	0	26			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000630130700001

By systemically investigating the electrochemical catalytic properties of the composite catalysts, it can be found that the enhancement in the OER activity of BSCF is mainly attributed to the co-catalysis effect with the OER process altered. The effect of carbon support on the electron conductivity improvement, which is widely considered in electrochemical systems, can be ignored during the OER catalysis on the rotating disk electrode. Functionalization with proper groups of the carbon support is, therefore, considered to be an effective and facile strategy to further improve the OER activity of metal oxide-based catalysts.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			1566-7367	1873-3905		WOS:000470950100002

However, little is known about the interaction between metallic oxides and oxygen in promoting the oxidative polymerization of small organic molecules during the humification process. The synthesis of humic-like acids (HLAs) with MnO2 was performed in the presence and absence of oxygen, and the influence of oxygen and MnO2 on the composition evolution of aminophenolic HLAs was illustrated. The results of ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra of reaction mixtures associated with two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) combined with the XPS spectra of N 1s content changes in HLAs demonstrated that MnO2 induced pyrrole-type nitrogen formation and enhanced darkening. Furthermore, MnO2 mainly acted as a catalyst, and oxygen activated the regeneration of MnO2 by oxidizing free manganese ions, thus substantially promoting the formation and accumulation of HLAs, whereas it decreased the reaction rate of HLAs formation. Moreover, carbon dioxide release was found during the process of the formation of fulvic-like acids (FLAs), and the reaction was oxygen-independent. Additionally, the formation and transformation of products without MnO2 do not obey kinetics equations, whereas the darkening reaction with MnO2 followed the pseudo-secondorder and pseudo-zero-order kinetics equations. These findings provide new insights into the behaviours and fate of the oxygen-mediated humification process and related reaction products. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The high specific surface area, mesoporous and graphitic carbon with more active sites ofFe-N(x)and Fe3C/Fe inFe-N-C(syn)favors good synergistic electrocatalytic effect toward oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions (ORR and OER) in alkaline medium. The bi-functional activity ofFe-N-C(syn)was clearly observed from the earlier onset potential of 0.86 V and limiting current density of 5.23 mA cm(-2)for ORR, as well as the low over potential of 470 mV with small Tafel slope value of 84 mV dec(-1)for OER.

The as-prepared Co-N-GCA has a hierarchical meso- and macroporous structure with a high N doping level (8.92 at. %) and a large specific surface area (456 m(2) g(-1)). In an alkaline medium, the catalyst exhibits superior ORR electrocatalytic activity with an onset potential 15 mV more positive than Pt/C, and its diffusion-limiting current density is 29% higher than that of commercial Pt/C. The obtained Co-N-GCA is also highly active toward the OER, with a small overpotential of 408 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Its overall oxygen electrode activity parameter (Delta E) is 0.821 V, which is comparable to most of the best nonprecious-metal catalysts reported previously.

For that purpose we have prepared tetrakis(3',5'-dimethoxyphenyl)porphyrinato cobalt(II) (CoDMTPP) and 5,10,15,20tetrakis(3',5'-dihydroxyphenyl)porphyrinato cobalt(II) (CoDHTPP). Further, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) based composites of CoDMTPP (MWCNTs-CoDMTPP) and CoDHTPP (MWCNTs-CoDHTPP) are also prepared and characterized through spectroscopy (UV-vis, FTIR, and XPS), microscopy (SEM, TEM with EDAX), X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry, and electrochemical techniques. The materials, MWCNTs-CoDMTPP and MWCNTs-CoDHTPP are immobilized on glassy carbon (GC) electrodes, represented as GC/MWCNTs-CoDMTPP and GC/MWCNTs-CoDHTPP. They show efficient ORR activity in acidic, basic, and neutral (pH 7.0 buffer) mediums. Further, both of these electrodes exhibit significant OER activity in 0.1 M KOH, indicating the bifunctional activity in basic medium. Based on the kinetic studies, the presence of -OH in the CoDHTPP is found to enhance the ORR activity. The electrodes, GC/MWCNTs-CoDMTPP and GC/MWCNTs-CoDHTPP exhibit high methanol tolerance capacity. A very small change in onset potential of 12 mV at GC/MWCNTs-CoDMTPP and 3 mV at GC/MWCNTs-CoDHTPP electrodes are observed for the ORR after 3000 continuous potential cycles indicating the high operational stability of the modified electrodes.

However, exploring the cheap and highly efficient electrocatalysts with Pt-like activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains great challenges. Herein, we report hierarchical Ni-incorporated oxygen vacancies-rich tungsten oxides micro-flowers on 3D conductive carbon cloth support (denoted as Ni-W H2-550) as a binder-free electrode for high efficient hydrogen evolution. The binder-free 3D structure and the synergistic effect between Niincorporated and rich oxygen vacancies can regulate the electronic structure, facilitate the electron transfer, and enlarge the exposed active sites. The as-prepared Ni-W H2-550 exhibits a low overpotential of 25 mV at 10 mA cm-2 with robust stability in alkaline electrolyte solution over 20 h.

Given the limited reserves of noble metals and many competitive applications in environmental protection, new energy, and chemical industries, many studies have focused on exploring new and efficient non-noble metal catalytic systems, improving the understanding of the OER mechanism of non-noble metal surfaces, and designing electrocatalysts with higher activity than traditional noble metals. This Review summarizes the research progress of anode OER catalysts for hydrogen production by electrochemical water splitting in recent years, for noble metal and non-noble metal catalysts, where non-noble metal catalysts are highlighted. The categories are as follows: (1) Transition metal-based compounds, including transition metal-based oxides, transition metal-based layered hydroxides, and transition metal-based sulfides, phosphides, selenides, borides, carbides, and nitrides. Transition metal-based oxides can also be divided into perovskite, spinel, amorphous, rock-salt-type, and lithium oxides according to their different structures. (2) Carbonaceous materials and their composite materials with transition metals. (3) Transition metal-based metal-organic frameworks and their derivatives. Finally, the challenges and future development of the OER process of water splitting are discussed.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000722635400001	34704377

Electrocatalysts can eliminate the energy barrier to solve energy consumption and efficiency problems. Here, hierarchical NiS2/MoS2 growing on carbon cloth (abbreviated as NiS2/MoS2-CC) is synthesized through a two-step process with bifunctional properties for both the HER and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Different amounts of NiS2 are uniformly doped into MoS2 samples to optimize the composition. It is noted that the optimal NiS2/MoS2-CC electrode shows a good electrocatalytic performance and durability in a 1.0 M KOH alkaline solution for the HER, OER, and overall water splitting processes. This result demonstrates that the synergistic effect between MoS2 and NiS2 can enhance the electrocatalytic performance. Furthermore, NiS2/MoS2-CC as an electrode for overall water splitting shows good stability at low cell voltage. Our study demonstrates a potential method for overall water splitting.

Layered double hydroxides (LDH) were reported as promising catalysts for the OER, but their low electrical conductivity restricts their widespread applications. To overcome this problem, a composite material containing Mn-Co LDH ultrathin nanosheet and highly conductive graphene was synthesized for the first time. Benefited from the high electrocatalytic activity and the superior charge transfer ability induced by these components, the new material shows superior OER activity. Used as the OER catalyst, a high current density of 461 mA cm(-2) at 2.0 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) was measured besides shows a low overpotential of 0.33 V at 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the new composite also shows a superior bifunctional water splitting performance as catalyst for the OER and HER (hydrogen evolution reaction) catalysts. Our results indicate that the presented material is a promising candidate for water splitting which is cheap and efficient.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16				2073-4344		WOS:000448331700010

These catalysts also enable unique opportunities to understand reaction pathways through detailed spectroscopic and computational studies. Here, we demonstrate that atomically dispersed iridium sites on indium tin oxide prepared via surface organometallic chemistry display exemplary catalytic activity in one of the most challenging electrochemical processes, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In situ X-ray absorption studies revealed the formation of Ir-V=O intermediate under OER conditions with an Ir-O distance of 1.83 angstrom. Modeling of the reaction mechanism indicates that Ir-V=O is likely a catalyst resting state, which is subsequently oxidized to Ir-VI enabling fast water nucleophilic attack and oxygen evolution. We anticipate that the applied strategy can be instrumental in preparing and studying a broad range of atomically dispersed transition metal catalysts on conductive oxides for (photo) electrochemical applications.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			2374-7943	2374-7951		WOS:000555422900023	32724853

In recent years, electrocatalytic water splitting achieved by graphene hybrids has received wide recognition; additionally, nitrogen (N)-doped carbon materials have shown promising catalytic activity for oxygen-reduction reactions (ORR) as metal-free alternatives to platinum. In an effort to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism that drives such high catalytic activity, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were applied to oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on pristine and N-doped graphene surfaces. A wide portfolio of investigations was carried out on pristine, 1.7% N-doped, and 3.3% N-doped graphene systems including water adsorption energy calculations, charge density differences calculations, the density of states (DOS) and band structure comparisons. The defect formation energy of 3.3% N-doped graphene for different configurations has been carried out to find the most stable configuration. Lastly, the nudged elastic band (NEB) theory was utilized to estimate the reaction coordinate and minimum energy path (MEP) at each stage of the reaction. By modulating N-doping concentration on the graphene layer, the MEP of the reaction coordinate was calculated. It was found that the barrier potential of energetic elementary steps decreases with increasing N-doping concentration. Finally, our results reveal that the primary reasons that drive an efficient water-splitting reaction include the nitrogen species' intrinsic electronegativity together with a shift of the Fermi level towards the conduction band, thus making the system more conductive.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2352-4928		WOS:000600970700003

The results reveal that the anodic behaviors and reaction kinetics of the two anodes vary a lot during the anodic polarization which indicate the formation and stabilization of anodic layer. Compared with conventional Pb-0.8%Ag anode, Al/Pb-0.8%Ag anode has longer time of anodic polarization. At the very beginning of anodic polarization, the two anodes all exhibit higher potential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) since the reaction is controlled by the transformation step of intermediates. Then, its OER potential is largely diminished and OER rate is deduced from the formation and adsorption of the first intermediate (S-OHads). In the prolonged anodic polarization, the anodic potential of Al/Pb-0.8%Ag gradually decreases and the final value is more stable than that of conventional Pb-0.8%Ag anode. On the anodic layer after 24 h of anodic polarization, the OER potential is controlled by the formation and adsorption of intermediate. The microstructures of Al/Pb-0.8%Ag and Pb-0.8%Ag anodes after 24 h of anodic polarization were analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM).									7	7	0	0	0	0	9			1003-6326	2210-3384		WOS:000339852000040

Instead of only adjusting the electronic structure, here we utilize ferroelectric polarization to accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction as well. This is demonstrated on a multiferroic layered perovskite Bi5CoTi3O15 with in-situ grown BiCoO3. Thanks to the superimposed effects of electronic regulation and ferroelectric polarization, the as-prepared multiferroic electrocatalysts are more efficient than the benchmark IrO2 (with a final 320 mV overpotential at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a 34 mV dec(-1) Tafel slope). This work not only demonstrates a low-cost and high-efficient OER electrocatalyst, but also provides a strategic design for multi-component electrocatalytic material systems by consideration of both spin and polarization degrees of freedom.									48	1	0	0	3	0	48			2041-1723			WOS:000462721900008	30926788

Introducing Ce, a typical rare earth element, into Ni3S2 is realized by a facile one-step electrodeposition method to promote its activity for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Doping Ce into Ni3S2 preserves the original morphology and structure of Ni3S2 while regulates the surface chemical states with rich active sites. As the results, better conductivity, more active sites, and larger intrinsic activity for Ce-doped Ni3S2 enhance the catalytic activity for OER. Impressively, a decrease of 87 mV to afford the current density of 50 mA cm(-2) (where the overpotential is 257 mV) and a good retention in current density after 24 h' test demonstrate the remarkable improvement in activity and durability of Ce-doped Ni3S2 in comparison with pure Ni3S2. Therefore, the facile electrodeposition method of doping Ce benefits Ni3S2 with the better activity toward OER, facilitating and accelerating the low-cost and stable water electrolysis.									32	1	0	0	2	0	33			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000517663800089

In this study, a novel lattice manipulation strategy for the exploration of highly active electrocatalysts was established via self-assembly between exfoliated MXene and layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets (NSs). Electrostatically-driven self-assembly between cationic Co-Fe-LDH and anionic MXene NSs yielded intimately-coupled Co-Fe-LDH-MXene nanohybrids with porous stacking structures and significant interfacial charge transfer. The self-assembled Co-Fe-LDH-MXene nanohybrid delivered excellent electrocatalyst functionality with a lowered overpotential of 252 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) that is much better than those of the precursor Co-Fe-LDH and MXene NSs. The outstanding electrocatalytic activity of the self-assembled Co-Fe-LDH-MXene nanohybrid highlights a high efficacy of the self-assembly methodology in exploring high-performance electrocatalysts. In situ surface enhanced Raman scattering analysis during electrocatalysis found that the enhanced redox activity of metal cations achieved by intimate electronic coupling with ultrathin conductive MXene NSs mainly contributes to the improved performance of the Co-Fe-LDH-MXene nanohybrids for oxygen evolution reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2053-1583			WOS:000859325300001

Moreover, the application potential of the synthesized powders for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media was demonstrated, showing that a low degree of inversion is beneficial for the overall performance.

Herein, two trifunctional electrocatalysts composed of Ni-NiM2O4 (M = Mn or Fe) supported on N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT) were in situ synthesized by pyrolysis of NiMnand NiFe-based precursors, respectively, under a NH3/Ar atmosphere. The hybrids exhibit robust trifunctional catalytic performance for HER, OER and ORR in an alkaline electrolyte. Especially, NCNT/Ni-NiMn2O4 exhibits excellent performance for zinc- air batteries with a high specific capacity of 502 mA h g-1 and a maximum power density of 105 mW cm-2, comparable to that of the Pt/C-based zinc-air battery. This study provides a feasible strategy for preparing highly efficient trifunctional electrocatalysts by in situ coupling metal/metal spinel oxide composites with high conductivity nanocarbon.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2044-4753			INSPEC:19165417

In particular, the oxygen activity of double perovskite-structured NdBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+delta (NBSCF) is 0.973 V, which is much greater than that of previously reported transition metal-based nanostructures. This result is verified by examination of the electronic structure, oxidation state, and electrical properties of the perovskite-based materials using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the iodometric titration method, X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. Further improvements of NBSCF for bifunctional oxygen activity are made by incorporating these synergistic hybrid structures with nitrogen doped-reduced graphene-based (N-rGO) nanostructures (NBSCF/N-rGO). The NBSCF/N-rGO has an oxygen electrode activity of 0.766 V, which is superior to that of other previously reported transition metal-based nanostructures and compares favorably to that of precious metal electrocatalysts. Furthermore, strong N-rGO provides considerably greater electrochemical long-term stability and integrity to NBSCF/N-rGO hybrid catalysts under continuous chronopotentiometric and long-term potential sweep testing conditions for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).									38	0	0	0	4	0	37			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000404571500043

In this paper, a self-templated strategy combined within-situphosphorization is applied to construct hollow structured bimetallic cobalt-nickel phosphide (CoN-iP(x)) nanocages. Owing to their unique hollow structure and bimetallic synergistic effects, the as-synthesized CoNiPx hollow nanocages exhibit a high electrocatalytic activity and stability towards hydrogen evolution reaction in all-pH electrolyte and a remarkable electrochemical performance for oxygen evolution reaction in 1.0 mol L-1 KOH. Meanwhile, with the bifunctional electrocatalyst in both anode and cath ode for overall water splitting, a low voltage of 1.61 V and superior stability are achieved at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2).									19	1	0	0	1	0	19			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000576798200001

Here, based upon rapid solidification and the dealloying inheritance effect, a eutectic-derived self-templating strategy is reported to fabricate hierarchically porous Mo-doped Ni-Fe oxide nanowires for catalyzing overall water splitting. The advanced catalyst exhibits a remarkably low overpotential (only requires an overpotential of 231 mV for 10 mA cm(-2)) and low Tafel slope (39 mV dec(-1)) towards the OER in 1 M KOH. Comparing with the Ni-Fe oxide without Mo-doping, the Mo-doped Ni-Fe oxide nanowires show enhanced activities towards the HER with 84 mV less overpotential to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Strikingly, an alkaline electrolyzer assembled by using the Mo-doped Ni-Fe oxide nanowires as both the anode and the cathode consumes a cell voltage as low as 1.62 V (at 10 mA cm(-2)). The exceptional properties of the catalyst can be ascribed to its well-designed hierarchically porous nanowire network, and enhanced electric conductivity profiting from the remaining Ni metal in the oxide, as well as the synergistic effect of Mo and the Ni-Fe system. These favorable factors concurrently contribute to the boosted active surface area, facilitated electron/ electrolyte transport, and accelerated reaction kinetics of water splitting.									49	3	0	0	1	0	49			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000434624800033

The partial deposition of Fe(III) onto Ni(OH)(2) with heterostructure obviously enhanced the OER current density and reduced the overpotential, and the Fe(III) cations in electrolyte also furnished positive contribution to the catalytic reaction, the synergy between Ni(OH)(2) electrode and Fe(III) cations in electrolyte therefore substantially improved the OER catalytic efficiency with low overpotential (285 mV at current density of 50 mA cm(-2)) and obviously enhanced current density (391 mA cm(-2) at 1.8 V). The current work expands our understanding on the effect of Fe(III) cations in electrolyte to OER efficiency of Ni based catalyst, and opens up a cost-effective and practical avenue to enhance the OER catalytic efficiency by introducing metal cations in alkali electrolyte.

The organic/inorganic hybrid nature offers MONs distinct advantages over other inorganic nanosheets in terms of diversity of organic ligands and metal notes. Compared to bulk three-dimensional metal-organic frameworks, 2D MONs possess merits of high density and readily accessible catalytic sites, reduced diffusion pathways for reactants/products, and fast electron transport. These features endow MONs with enhanced physical/chemical properties and are ideal for heterogeneous catalysis. In this Review, state-of-the-art synthetic methods for the fabrication of 2D MONs were summarized. The advances of 2D MONs-based materials for electrocatalysis and photocatalysis, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and electro-/photocatalytic organic transformations were systematically discussed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives regarding future design and synthesis of 2D MONs for high-performance electrocatalysis and photocatalysis were provided.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000759384400001	35092355

Although significant progress has been made on constructing and understanding carbon supported single atom electrocatalysts (SAECs), few attentions has been paid to metal oxide supported SAECs. The effect of single atom in enhancing electro-catalytic activity and stability of metal oxides has been poorly understood. Here, we reported MnO2 nanowires loaded with single atomic Ag (Ag-MnO2) that can simultaneously catalyze oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The incorporation of Ag into the crystal framework of alpha-MnO2 provided multiple benefits including an improved conductivity and a substantial increase in both lattice distortion and oxygen vacancies. As a result, Ag-MnO2 outperformed alpha-MnO2 in oxygen electrocatalysis and showed similar to 3-fold enhancement in kinetic current density. The Zinc air battery containing the Ag-MnO2 displayed a high discharge peak power of 273.2mWcm(-2), an energy density of 915.4 Wh kgZn(-1) and an outstanding rate performance. The Zinc air battery (ZAB) stably operated up to 3200 cycles of charge-discharge. Such excellent rechargeability can be ascribed to the promoted crystal phase transformation from alpha-MnO2 to delta-MnO2 that is beneficial for OER due to the presence of atomic Ag.									51	3	0	0	4	0	51			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000459903100061

Here, we introduce a 3-MeOsalophen-ligated cobalt complex as a precursor to obtain a Co-based OER electrocatalyst via controlled pyrolysis under an inert atmosphere. In our case, the unique N, O chelation mode of the 3-MeOsalophen ligand (bis[ 3-methoxysalicylydene]-1,2 iminophenylenediamine) was used to synthesis a Co2 complex [ Co2(3-MeOsalophen)(Cl) 3(CH3OH) 2]. By regulating the pyrolysis conditions, we successfully obtained a N-doped carbon Co/ CoOx core-shell nanostructure. More importantly, TG-MS was first adopted for tracking the decomposition products of the complex in the pyrolysis process, further finding out the evolution mechanism from Co2 to the core-shell nanostructure. As an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction, the core-shell Co/ CoOx@ NC-800 nanostructure achieves an ultralow overpotential of 288 mV at 10 mA cm 2 in 1 M KOH solution. This work offers guiding insight into controlled pyrolysis via TG-MS analysis, using a novel complex precursor for precise regulation of heteroatom-doped (3d) transition metal-based electrocatalysts.									18	3	0	0	2	0	18			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000465940700019	31123565

This paper investigates a new perovskite material, Sr2TiMnO6 (STMO), for a rechargeable zinc-air battery (ZAB). The crystalline structure, morphology, and adsorption/desorption behavior of STMO are thoroughly studied and investigated their catalytic processes. The perovskite catalyst shows high catalytic activities, durability, and endurance in the alkaline medium, resulting in the power density of 97 mW center dot cm(-2), and a specific capacity of 705.21 mAh center dot g(-1). The rechargeable STMO ZAB exhibited good cycling stability with the current density of 3.5 mA center dot cm(-2) for 6.66 h and low overpotential. The observed results promise STMO to be a viable candidate as a functional (ORR/OER) electrocatalyst which can be successfully used for commercial fuel-cells and metal air batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2578-4862		WOS:000716515300001

Kinetic parameters of the hydrogen evolution reaction on electrodes show that the incorporation of bismuth in the alloys decreases the hydrogen overpotential and increases the hydrogen evolution rate. Oxygen evolution rates are measured by a step-potentiostatic method, together with gas collection. The results show that oxygen evolution rates are enhanced by the bismuth additions and also influenced by the quantity of lead dioxide on the electrode surface.

However, precisely controlling the amount of vacancy defects remains challenging. Here, we propose a facile and efficient hydrothermal accompanying an annealing method to synthesize a series of Mn-doped CoO nanomaterials with controllable oxygen vacancies and unique morphology. The oxygen vacancies amount can be precisely controlled by adjusting the Mndoping content and is positively correlated with catalytic performance. It was found that the oxygen vacancies amount can reach up to 38.2% over the Mn-doped CoO nanomaterials, resulting in ultra-high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity (HER: 25.6 and 37 mV at 10 mA cm-2; OER: 301 and 322 mV at 50 mA cm-2) under both basic and acidic conditions, while reaching 10 mA cm-2 for an ultra-low cell voltage of only 1.52 V, which exceeds that of Pt/C/RuO2 and all reported non-noble metal oxide catalysts. The DFT calculations reveal oxygen vacancies can optimize H* and HOO* intermediates adsorption free energy, thus improving the HER and OER performance. Interestingly, the Mn-doped CoO with rich oxygen vacancies exhibits excellent antibacterial properties in vitro of biomedicine.

The processed tungsten trioxide (WO3) thins films were carbonized at high temperature through methane treatment and studied extensively for their material properties. The carbonization effect on thin films were evaluated by diffraction, Raman, luminescence and scanning-electron microscopic studies. The influence of carbonization was also studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, where the effect of carbon species was quite conclusive. Carbonized and uncarbonized thin films were further collectively studied for their electrocatalytic potential by recording the electrochemical impedance and Mott-Schottky (MS) plots. Both the type of thin films were then subjected to oxygen evolution related electrocatalytic studies under alkaline pH (10 and 14) conditions. The enhanced conductivity studied in MS analysis in carbonized thin films were found to promote the oxygen production kinetics in respective electrode. This was affirmed through reduced overpotential values of 248 mV for carbonized thin films against 294 mV of un-carbonized ones. The Tafel slope values improved significantly in carbonized WO3 thin films. Finally, the stability related electrochemical results approved the processed films as viable electrocatalysts for effective oxygen evolution reactions. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

Oxide electrocatalysts such as RuO2 are often used to improve the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) processes in Li-O-2 batteries, but the relation between the structural parameters and their catalytic properties is unclear so far. In this work, we synthesize RuO2 nano-particles at different annealing temperatures and investigate the influence of the Ru-O bond distances of RuO2 on the OER and ORR processes in Li-O-2 batteries. The results of X-ray absorption fine structure show that the bond distances decrease with the increase of the annealing temperature. The RuO2 with longer Ru-O bond distances renders a lower charge plateau to Li-O-2 batteries, showing a better OER performance, while that with shorter bond distances gives a larger discharge capacity and is more friendly to the ORR process. The cycle life of Li-O-2 batteries with a carbon nanotube-RuO2 composite cathode is improved to 287 cycles (1148 h) under an extreme testing condition (the voltage range is 2.3-4.2 V), when the Ru-O bond distances are optimized. In addition, the influence of the Ru-O bond distances on the catalytic properties of RuO2 is analyzed by density functional theory calculations. The findings in this work provide a guidance to enhance the ORR and OER efficiency of RuO2 and other oxide catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1359-8368	1879-1069		WOS:000760481800001

However, demands for their active catalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and especially oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are still urgently needed and challenging. To address this issue, we rationally select B, N co-doped graphene nanotubes (BN-CNT) as active substrate to support CoMoS3.13 nanosheets to fabricate bifunctional catalyst for overall water electrolysis. The present contribution indicates that, doped N and B species can serve as active sites to improve the HER and OER activity of transition metal sulfides. Moreover, BN-CNT substrate not only assures the edge terminated texture of CoMoS3.13 nanosheets for more active sites, but also acts as "highway" to accelerate the charge transfer for enhanced reaction kinetics. Therefore, remarkably enhanced HER and OER catalytic activities are obtained from the hybrid catalyst, including decreased overpotetnial, increased catalytic current density, improved reaction kinetics, and superior stable durability. We believed that BN-CNT could be further used to composite with other metal chalcogenides, hydroxides, or phosphides as high-performance electrocatalysts for applications in sustainable energy conversion systems.

We found that the EIS and DEIS results compare fairly well below the onset of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, in the OER potential region, some differences were observed between the information derived from these measurements. Cyclic voltammetry and inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry experiments revealed that the long time required by EIS cause chemical and structural changes of the Ir(111) surface and oxygen evolution, thus adversely affecting the reliability of the impedance measurement. On the contrary, the short time required for DEIS measurements help mitigating these negative effects, thus highlighting the benefits of such technique to investigate the early stages of surface oxide formation on Ir single crystals.

However, introducing oxygen vacancies intentionally in a-Fe2O3 for active solar water splitting through facile and effective methods remains a challenge. Herein, air plasma treatment is shown to produce oxygen vacancies in a-Fe2O3, and ultrathin a-Fe2O3 nanoflakes are used to investigate the effect of oxygen vacancies on the performance of photoelectrochemical oxygen oxidation. Increasing the plasma treatment duration and power is found to increase the density of oxygen vacancies and leads to a significant enhancement of the photocurrent response. The nanoflake photoanode with the optimized plasma treatment yields an incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency of 35.4% at 350 nm under 1.6 V vs RHE without resorting to any other cocatalysts, an efficiency far exceeding that of the pristine a-Fe2O3 nanoflakes (similar to 2.2%). Evidence for the presence of high density of oxygen vacancies confined in nanoflakes is clarified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The increased number of oxygen vacancies after plasma treatment resulting in an increased carrier density is interpreted as the main cause for the enhanced oxygen evolution reaction activity.									127	6	0	0	4	0	127			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000363001500030	26400020

Here we report an iridium oxide/strontium iridium oxide (IrOx/SrIrO3) catalyst formed during electrochemical testing by strontium leaching from surface layers of thin films of SrIrO3. This catalyst has demonstrated specific activity at 10 milliamps per square centimeter of oxide catalyst (OER current normalized to catalyst surface area), with only 270 to 290 millivolts of overpotential for 30 hours of continuous testing in acidic electrolyte. Density functional theory calculations suggest the formation of highly active surface layers during strontium leaching with IrO3 or anatase IrO2 motifs. The IrOx/SrIrO3 catalyst outperforms known IrOx and rutheniumoxide (RuOx) systems, the only other OER catalysts that have reasonable activity in acidic electrolyte.									1121	56	0	0	68	0	1136			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000382558900034	27701108

NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) has been considered as one of the most promising OER catalysts due to its unique layered structure, high performance, and low cost. However, it is limited by the poor conductivity and insufficient exposure to active sites. Therefore, an efficient modification method can greatly improve the electrocatalytic performance of NiFe-LDH. In this review, several typical modification methods are reviewed in detail, including defects introducing, exfoliating, elements doping, surface decorating, and in-situ growing. These methods can develop the intrinsic activity of NiFe-LDH effectively by exposing more reactive sites, increasing the conductivity, and reducing the kinetic energy barrier. Finally, the challenges and opportunities about modifications of NiFe-LDH are discussed.									3	2	0	0	0	0	4			1005-281X			WOS:000596556500013

However, improving the electrochemical performance of oxygen-evolution catalysts is a significant challenge. In this paper, exceptionally active electrocatalysts for oxygen-evolution reactions (OERs) were successfully developed and characterized by using SEM, TEM, XRD, BET, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The nitrogen-doped hollow-carbon-encapsulated bimetallic nanoparticles (MM '-NHCNPs) were prepared by using folic acid coordination polymerization. The hollow structure and the synergistic effect of bimetallic doping exhibited remarkable catalytic performance and outstanding stability for the OER in a 1.0 m KOH alkaline electrolyte. For the OER, the overpotential of the best catalyst was only 350 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 58 mV dec(-1). High durability was also demonstrated by the MM '-NHCNPs. Such an MM '-NHCNP catalyst with excellent electrochemical properties provides a promising material for OERs.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000449792900023	30109776

In order to further improve the detection resolution, in this study, the weak measurement (WM) method was introduced to in situ detect the electrochemical reaction during the linear sweep voltammetry or the cyclic voltammetry tests with quantitative measurement of the absolute current density, which lays a foundation for replacing the TIR for two-dimensional imaging of electrochemical reactions in vanadium flow batteries, oxygen/hydrogen evolution reaction, surface treatments, electrochemical corrosion and so on.

This study demonstrates a facile electrospinning technique for functionalizing the carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with Nb2O5 co-catalyst as the support material for platinum nanoparticles. The resultant Nb CNF-Pt electrode has a sensible Pt loading of 30 mu g cm(-2) and manifests high catalytic activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The Nb CNF-Pt outperforms the commercial 20 wt% Pt loaded carbon with high positive onset potential (0.99 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and half-wave potential (0.87 V vs RHE) during ORR. It also provides large electrochemical active surface area (94.19 m(2) g(-1)) and mass activity (783.34 mA mg(-1)) during MOR. Furthermore, the Nb CNF-Pt electrode demands an extremely minimal overpotential of 37 and 325 mV and a Tafel slope of 38 and 81 mV dec(-1) for HER and OER, respectively. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity of Nb CNF-Pt is attributed to the strong metal-support interaction between Nb2O5 and Pt, resulting in a uniform loading of Pt NPs with reduced particle size and agglomeration-free distribution.									20	2	0	0	0	0	20			2196-7350			WOS:000477190700001

The crucially important air cathode of the Zn-air battery undergoes gas-involving oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the discharging and charging steps, resulting in complicated reactions and sluggish kinetic processes at the solid-liquid-gas interface. Micropore-dominated metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been demonstrated as a promising precursor in the field of electrocatalysis. However, the microporosity of MOF derivatives severely impedes the mass and charge transfer for the ORR/OER. Hence, the rational design of a hierarchically porous structure for multiscale mass/electron transport channels is essential for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts derived from MOFs. In this review, the latest developments of hierarchically porous ORR/OER electrocatalysts derived from MOFs for Zn-air batteries are covered. First, we introduce the related fundamentals of rechargeable Zn-air batteries and focus on the electrochemical oxygen reactions occurring at the air cathode. Then, recent advances of hierarchically porous MOF derivatives for the ORR, OER, and Zn-air batteries are discussed in detail. Finally, the synthesis strategies of hierarchically porous MOFs and their derivatives are presented as well.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10				2052-1537		WOS:000631418600007

Benefiting from sufficient active sites and their improved activity around the heterointerface, accompanied by the good conductivity, the NiSe2/Fe3O4 nanotubes exhibit as a superior OER electrocatalyst, which affords the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a very small overpotential of 199 mV, high attainable current density beyond 200 mA cm(-2), and mass activity of 984.5 A g(-1), as well as excellent stability for 100 h in the alkaline media.

The pyridinium functionalized coordination containers as robust molecular electrooxidation catalysts for water oxidation have been well investigated. They exhibited efficient electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with the lowest overpotential of 0.290 V to afford 10 mA cm(-2) current density and remarkable stability over 48 h without any significant shift in the overpotential. The strategy for the functionalization of coordination containers provides a novel approach to achieve sustainable oxygen evolution with high efficiency and excellent stability, and a new opportunity for designing and realizing functional supramolecular materials for energy storage and conversion technologies.									14	2	0	0	2	0	14			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000415990800019

These are produced from ribonucleotides, the building blocks of RNA, and the direction of this reaction has been taken to support the idea that, in evolution, RNA preceded DNA as genetic material. However, an understanding of the evolutionary relationships among the three modern-day classes of ribonucleotide reductase and how the first reductase arose early in evolution is still far off. We propose that the diversification of this class of enzymes is inherently tied to microbial colonization of aerobic and anaerobic niches. The work is of broader interest, as it also sheds light on the process of adaptation to oxygenic environments consequent to the evolution of atmospheric oxygen.									40	1	0	0	37	0	42			0022-2844			WOS:000176691400005	12107594

Although it could achieve higher reversible capacity due to the oxygen anion participating in electrochemical reaction, however, its use in energy storage systems has been limited. The reason is the irreversible oxygen reaction that occurs during the initial charge cycle, resulting in structural instability due to oxygen evolution and phase transition. To suppress the initial irreversible oxygen reaction, we introduced the surface-modified Li[Li0.2Ni0.16Mn0.56Co0.08]O-2 prepared by carbon coating (carbonization process), which was verified to have reduced oxygen reaction during the initial charge cycle. The electrochemical performance is improved by the synergic effects of the oxygen-deficient layer and carbon coating layer formed on the surface of particles. The sample with suitable carbon coating exhibited the highest structural stability, resulting in reduced capacity fading and voltage decay, which are attributed to the mitigated layered-to-spinel-like phase transition during prolonged cycling. The control over the oxygen reaction of Li2MnO3 by surface modification affects the activation reaction above 4.4 V in the initial charge cycle and structure changes during prolonged cycling. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy analyses as well as electrochemical performance measurement were used to identify the correlation between reduced oxygen activity and structural changes.									38	3	0	0	5	0	39			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000429625400023	29561131

Removal of gas bubbles from the electrode is one of the key issues for better performance. This study investigated the effects of surface modification on the polarization curve of air electrode. Stainless steel mesh coated with needle-like deposit had better performance than those without coating. Electrode with needle-like surface had substantially lower OER over-potential.

A series of porous nickel sulfides hybridized with N and S co-doped carbon nanoparticles (NixSy-NSCs) with different chemical valences of Ni, Ni9S8-NSCs, Ni9S8-NiS1.03-NSCs, and NiS1.03-NSCs are successfully fabricated, and their electrocatalytic performances as oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysts are systematically investigated. The NixSy-NSCs are obtained via a two-step reaction including a low-temperature synthesis of Ni-Cys precursor followed by thermal decomposing of the precursor in Ar atmosphere. By controlling the sulfidation process during the formation of NixSy-NSCs, Ni9S8-NSCs, Ni9S8-NiS1.03-NSCs, and NiS1.03-NSCs are obtained, respectively, giving rise to the increase of high-valence Ni component, and resulting in gradually enhanced oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalytic activities. In particular, the NiS1.03-NSCs show an exceptional low overpotential of approximate to 270 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 68.9 mV dec(-1) with mass loading of 0.25 mg cm(-2) in 1 m KOH and their catalytic activities remained for at least 10 h, which surpass the state-of-the-art IrO2, RuO2, and Ni-based electrocatalysts.									32	3	0	0	1	0	32			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000425744600012	29286583

Herein, guided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, an efficient metal-free electrocatalyst is demonstrated via covalently bonding BP nanosheets with graphitic carbon nitride (denoted BP-CN-c). The polarized P-N covalent bonds in BP-CN-c can efficiently regulate the electron transfer from BP to graphitic carbon nitride and significantly promote the OOH* adsorption on phosphorus atoms. Impressively, the oxygen evolution reaction performance of BP-CN-c (overpotential of 350 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), 90% retention after 10 h operation) represents the state-of-the-art among the reported BP-based metal-free catalysts. Additionally, BP-CN-c exhibits a small half-wave overpotential of 390 mV for oxygen reduction reaction, representing the first bifunctional BP-based metal-free oxygen catalyst. Moreover, ZABs are assembled incorporating BP-CN-c cathodes, delivering a substantially higher peak power density (168.3 mW cm(-2)) than the Pt/C+RuO2-based ZABs (101.3 mW cm(-2)). The acquired insights into interfacial covalent bonds pave the way for the rational design of new and affordable metal-free catalysts.									25	1	0	0	1	0	25			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000646270600001	33939200

Here, we report an atomically dispersed Ru-1-N-4 site anchored on nitrogen-carbon support (Ru-N-C) as an efficient and durable electrocatalyst for acidic OER. The single-atom Ru-N-C catalyst delivers an exceptionally intrinsic activity, reaching a mass activity as high as 3571 A g(metal)(-1) and turnover frequency of 3348 O-2 h(-1) with a low overpotential of 267 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The catalyst shows no evident deactivation or decomposition after 30-hour operation in acidic environment. Operando synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy identify the dynamic adsorption of single oxygen atom on Ru site under working potentials, and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the O-Ru-1-N-4 site is responsible for the high OER activity and stability.									212	15	0	0	13	0	217			2041-1723			WOS:000492140800005	31649237

Finding electrode materials based on earth abundant elements is critical in this respect. Multinary transition metal oxides, such as the iron group spinels, can be efficient water oxidation electrocatalysts in alkaline media. Both Nirich and Fe-rich nickel ferrites have been synthesized through a chemical bath method by selecting specific bath temperature and composition. These electrodes, constituted by nanosheets, have been modified by the incorporation of phosphorus (as phosphate) in the structure, leading to either a substantial decrease (of around 0.1 V) in the overvoltage for oxygen evolution or a drastic decrease in the Tafel slope. Phosphate seems to have a dual role: it stabilizes the high oxidation states of surface nickel and probably provides sites for fast proton transfer. Both factors are needed for an efficient oxygen evolution reaction. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Given this, we directly in situ transform the residual iron present in raw single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) into Fe2O3 and thus build Fe2O3-CNT as the model system. Intriguingly, an anomalous self-optimization occurred on SWCNT and the derived components show satisfactory electrochemical performance. Soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS) analysis and theory calculation correspondingly indicate that self-optimization yields stronger interaction between SWCNT and Fe2O3 nanoparticles, where the electrons migrate from Fe2O3 to optimized SWCNT. Such polarization will generate a positive charge center and thus boost the OER activity. This finding directly observes the self-optimization of support effect, providing a new perspective for OER and related electrochemical reactions.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000658130900001

Thus, developing new screening methodologies and practical tools for OEC discovery is essential. Herein, we report a screening protocol which allows the accurate identification, benchmarking and kinetic analysis of molecular OECs using chemical oxidants, based on an oxygen-sensitive luminescent dissolved oxygen optical probe (DOOP). To demonstrate the practicality of this protocol, we screened more than 100 reactions to benchmark and evaluate the structure-activity relationship of several transition-metal complexes 1-16 based on Ru, Fe and Cu. Water-oxidation by Ru (II)-carboxylates is compared to structurally similar and less studied Ru(II)-carboxamides. A new Ru(II) complex 6 containing the doubly deprotonated N,N'-bis(aryl)pyridine-2,6-dicarboxamide was also synthesized and its oxygen evolution rate was found to be dramatically enhanced at neutral pH.

Herein, we developed a simple room-temperature exfoliation and reduction strategy to construct a core-shell structure electrocatalyst derived from multi-layer MOF precursor for an enhanced OER performance. The reduced MOFs displayed stable OER current with an overpotential as low as 253 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 39 mV dec(-1) and a TOF increased by 38 times compared to pristine MOFs. The significant boosting is attributed to the amorphous core-shell structure providing more active sites and sufficient inner defects to enhance the conductivity by NaBH4 reduction under ambient conditions.									16	1	0	0	0	0	17			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472566400014

The deposit morphology was the result of both the program of electrode polarization and the template action of the simultaneously formed TiO2 layer. The catalytic activity of the composite layers toward the oxygen reduction reaction was studied in aqueous 0.1 M NaOH solutions and found to be a function of both the surface loading of silver and the type of silver distribution within the Ag/TiO2 composite layers. The reaction path of oxygen reduction on the composite layers was found to be always a 4e(-) one, characteristic otherwise of polycrystalline silver electrodes.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0352-5139			WOS:000252412100024

Here, we report a nickel-based hybrid material, namely [Ni-3(BPE)(4)(BTB)(2)(H2O)(2)]center dot 2DMF center dot 2H2O [where BTB = 1,3,5-tris(4-carboxyphenyl)benzene and BPE = 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl) ethane] and Ni-BTB-BPE for ORR and OER. Structural analysis of Ni-BTB-BPE showed that the BTB ligand connectivity with a nickel center formed an interesting two-dimensional Kagome-type lattice and BPE ligand connectivity with the layers to form the three-dimensional structure. With the aid of the Ni (E-(Ni())2+/3+) redox site, the electrochemical surface concentration of Ni2+/3+ was calculated to be 5.49 nM/cm(2). Ni-BTB-BPE/C exhibited 108.95 A g(Ni)(-1) of ORR mass activity at 0.75 V versus RHE. The catalyst showed a completely methanol tolerant ORR performance. The four-electron turn-over frequency (2.24 electrons [Ni](-1) s(-1) at 0.70 V vs RHE) of Ni-BTB-BPE/C was found to be 2.67 times higher than that of the two-electron one, which indicates the higher selectivity of Ni-BTB-BPE/C catalyst in the four-electron pathway (OH- as a predominant product). Ni-BTB-BPE/C has performed ORR/OER activity with a bi-functionality index value of 0.9 at 1 mA cm(-2).									5	0	0	0	0	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000557375200046

About 700 oxygen-dependent enzymatic reactions are known, the vast majority of which emerged only after the appearance of oxygen in the biosphere, circa 3 billion years ago. Oxygen was a major driving force for evolutionary innovation-similar to 60% of all known oxygen-dependent enzyme families emerged as such; that is, the founding ancestor was an O-2-dependent enzyme. The other 40% seem to have diverged by tinkering from pre-existing proteins whose function was not related to oxygen. Here, we focus on the latter. We describe transitions from various enzyme classes, as well as from non-enzymatic proteins, and we explore these transitions in terms of catalytic chemistry, metabolism, and protein structure. These transitions vary from subtle ones, such as simply repurposing oxidoreductases by replacing an electron acceptor such as NAD by O-2, to drastic changes in reaction mechanism, such as turning carboxylases and hydrolases into oxidases. The latter is more common and can occur with strikingly minor changes, for example, only one mutation in the active site. We further suggest that engineering enzymes to harness the extraordinary reactivity of oxygen may yield higher catabolic power and versatility.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0961-8368	1469-896X		WOS:000788245500023	35481655

In this work, we carried out the theoretical study on the stability, activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and its dependence on the electronic structure of transition metal (TM) anchored on two types of borophene (called beta(12) and chi(3)) by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results show that the early- and VIII-TM anchored beta(12) and chi(3) borophenes are structurally and thermodynamically stable. The overpotentials of OER (eta(OER)) over the Ni supported on beta(12) and chi(3) borophene SACs, designated as beta(12)-Ni and chi(3)-Ni, are 0.38 and 0.35 V, respectively. The eta(ORR) of beta(12)-Ni and chi(3)-Ni are estimated to be as low as 0.34 and 0.39 V, respectively. The OER/ORR activity of the SACs can be well correlated with their electronic structures. The high eta(OER) values of early TM supported on borophene SACs correspond to high d-band center of TM. Both beta(12)-Ni and chi(3)-Ni have a moderate d-band center. Since the overpotentials for OER and ORR on beta(12)-Ni and chi(3)-Ni are comparable to those of Pt group metals and their oxides, beta(12)-Ni and chi(3)-Ni can be considered as the promising bifunctional catalysts for OER and ORR.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1610-2940	0948-5023		WOS:000614426300001	33537857

Nevertheless, manufacturing these architectures, while avoiding aggregation and retaining surface activity, remains challenging. Herein, for the first time we designed NiCoFe-Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanocages as a support for in situ dispersion and anchoring of polymetallic phosphide nanoparticles (pMP-NPs). Benefiting from the porous surfaces and the synergistic effects between pMP-NPs and the cyano groups in PBA, the NiCoFe-P-NP@ NiCoFe-PBA nanocages exhibit a significantly enhanced catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an overpotential of 223 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 78 mV dec(-1), outperforming the NiCoFe-PBA nanocubes, NiCoFe-P nanocages, NiFe-P-NP@NiFe-PBA nanocubes, and CoFe-P-NP@CoFe-PBA nanoboxes. This work not only offers the synthesis strategy of in situ anchoring pMP-NPs on PBA nanocages but also provides a new insight into optimized Gibbs free energy of OER by regulating electron transfer from metallic phosphides to PBA substrate.									107	4	0	0	7	0	108			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000641160500043	33769812

Here we report a high entropy alloy (HEA) - FeCoNiCuPd - thin film catalyst, which demonstrated excellent alkaline HER and OER performance with ultralow overpotentials as low as 29 mV for HER and 194 mV for OER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The outstanding catalytic activity for HER was found to originate from the multiple active sites present on the FeCoNiCuPd surface, while for OER it came from the highly functional (FeCoNi)-oxyhydroxide species formed on the film surface. Moreover, the two-electrode electrolyzer made of the FeCoNiCuPd film electrodes required a low cell voltage of 1.52 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, greatly outperforming commercially available Pt/C parallel to RuO2 electrodes, while maintaining a notable durability. This work demonstrated the remarkable potential of a HEA thin film in catalyzing watersplitting process.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000799052300005

Here we decouple these structural and chemical effects on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by using a set of coherently strained epitaxial NdNiO3 films. We show that within the regime where oxygen vacancies (V-O) are negligible, compressive strain is favorable for the OER whereas tensile strain is unfavorable; the former induces orbital splitting, resulting in a higher occupancy in the d(3z2-r2) orbital and weaker Ni-O chemisorption. However, when the tensile strain is sufficiently large to promote V-O formation, an increase in the OER is also observed. The partial reduction of Ni3+ to Ni2+ due to V-O makes the e(g) occupancy slightly larger than unity, which is thought to account for the increased OER activity. Our work highlights that epitaxial-strain-induced lattice distortion and V-O generation can be individually or collectively exploited to tune OER activity, which is important for the predictive synthesis of high-performance electrocatalysts.									40	2	0	0	2	0	41			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000463843900086	30834739

Owing to their special characteristics such as abundant cation compositions, high entropy stabilization, chemical and thermal stability, and lattice distortion effect, they have drawn ever-increasing attention for various applications. However, very few studies have been reported for catalytic application, and developing HEOs with large surface areas for efficient catalytic application is still in infancy. Herein, we design nanostructured HEO of (FeNiCoCrCu)(3)O-4 using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as sacrificial templates to achieve a large surface area, high density of exposed active sites, and more oxygen vacancies. Single-crystalline phase HEOs with surface area as large as 206 m(2) g(-1) are produced and further applied as bifunctional electrocatalysts for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Benefiting from enhanced oxygen vacancies and a large surface area with abundant exposed active sites, the optimized HEO exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity toward UOR with a very low potential of 1.35 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and showed long-term stability for 36 h operation, making a significant catalytic performance over previously reported HEOs. Moreover, the HEO demonstrated an efficient catalytic performance toward OER with a low overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and low Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1). The excellent catalytic activity is ascribed to the starting MOF precursor and favorable high-entropy effect.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000841611600001	35973162

Besides, their underlying catalytic mechanisms are subject of an ongoing debate. Herein, La0.8Sr0.2CoO3-delta (LSC) was selected as a base perovskite oxide for doping different elements into its B-site to fabricate four different La0.8Sr0.2Co0.8M0.2O3-delta (LSCM; M = Ni, Fe, Mn, and Cu) perovskite oxides. Among the catalysts tested with and without multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), La0.8Sr0.2Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (LSCF) outperformed any other catalysts in terms of both OER and ORR activity. The OER/ORR activity enhancement with LSCF is also discussed based on spectroscopic and microscopic analyses and lattice oxygen transportation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2633-5409		WOS:000712001900001

Various physical properties, such as the electronic structure, free energy, and charge occupation, of the MnO(100) surface in the PM state with several OER intermediates, were reckoned and compared to those in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. We found that PM fluctuation enhances charge transfer from a surface Mn ion to each of the intermediates and strengthens the chemical bond between them, while not altering the overall features, such as the rate determining step and resting state, in reaction pathways. The enhanced charge transfer can be attributed to the delocalized nature of valence bands observed in the PM surface. In addition, it was observed that chemical-bond enhancement depends on the intermediates, resulting in significant deviations in reaction energy barriers. Our study suggests that PM fluctuations play a significant role in the thermochemistry of chemical reactions occurring on correlated oxide surfaces.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000610150200010	33074274

However, the practical application of lithium air batteries is handicapped by their poor cycle life, high over-charge potential and low energy efficiency. Numerous studies have performed to improve the kinetics of the electrochemical reaction. Making a good oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst system is under intense scrutiny. In this work, we report a rational design of air electrode, which derives from biomass and presents a three-dimensional porous carbon architecture with high specific surface and large volume expansion coefficient. Combining with a soluble catalyst, this oxygen electrode presents an ultrahigh areal specific capacity of 7.95 mAh/cm(2) and a long cycling life up to 1000 cycles with suppressed polarization (about 0.46 V). The greatly improved overall performance is due to the synergetic effect of the novel designed oxygen electrode capable of mediating the redox mediators to trigger the ORR and OER process.									8	1	0	0	0	0	9			2405-8297			WOS:000529908800009

Herein, we prepare Mo-CoP with a nanosheet structure via hydrothermal reactions and phosphorization. Taking advantage of the nanosheet array, the good electrocatalytic performance of Co-based materials for HER and excellent performance of Co-based phosphide for OER are fully demonstrated. Mo-CoP requires only 112 and 329.9 mV to achieve a current density of 100 mA/cm(2) for HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Furthermore, when it was used as bifunctional electrocatalyst, Mo-CoP could deliver 10 mA/cm(2) at a low cell voltage of 1.54 V. It was found that the activity of Mo-CoP could be ascribed to the structure of nanosheet and the synergistic role of two different metal phosphides. The most important is that the introduction of Mo improves the activity of the catalyst.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000647542000002

Mechanistic understanding of pH effects on the oxygen evolution reaction								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				405						139810	10.1016/j.electacta.2021.139810				FEB 10 2022	2022	The oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) is pivotal in many energy-conversion technologies as it is an important counter reaction to others that convert stable chemicals to higher-value products using electrochemistry. The local microenvironment and pH for the anode OER can vary from acidic to neutral to alkaline depending on the system being explored, making definitive mechanistic insights difficult. In this paper, we couple experiments, first-principles calculations based on density functional theory, microkinetics, and transport modeling to explore the entire pH range of the OER. At low current densities, neutral pH values unexpectedly perform better than the acidic and alkaline conditions, and this trend is reversed at higher current densities ( > 20 mA cm -2 ). Using multiscale modeling, this switch is rationalized by a change from a dual-reaction mechanism to a single rate-determining step. The model also shows how the alkaline reaction rates dominate in the middle to high pH range. Furthermore, we explore that the local pH for near-neutral conditions is much different ( e.g ., 2.4 at the reaction surface vs. 9 in the bulk) than the pH extremes, demonstrating the criticality that transport phenomena plays in kinetic activity.

Besides the conventional metal-based nanoparticle catalysts, constructing single-atom catalysts (SACs) on two-dimensional (2D) materials has become an important research direction in recent years. In this review, we summarize the recent strategies for the synthesis of SACs, the experimental and theoretical studies of 2D material-based SACs to enhance the OER performance, and the rational design principles of SACs toward the OER, as well as the challenges and future directions. A discussion is provided for a better understanding of the OER, to guide the optimization of electrocatalysts, and for possible future candidates of SACs.									22	2	0	0	0	0	22			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000638260500001

Importantly, the electrocatalysts need not only be efficient but also inexpensive and source-abundant from the viewpoint of sustainability. Herein, we report active and stable bifunctional catalysts for oxygen electrodes obtained by pyrolysis of pristine coal in ammonia. The pyrolysis yielded nitrogen-rich mesoporous graphitic carbon containing pyrrolic, pyridinic and graphitic groups, which demonstrated very good electrocatalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 0.1 M NaOH. The optimized catalyst afforded a stable round-trip over-voltage of 0.97 V when cycling between the ORR at a current density of -1.0 mA cm(-2) and the OER at 10 mA cm(-2), lower than those of RuO2 and IrO2 in the same solution, thus unveiling a unique opportunity to directly transform coal into a valuable catalyst without costly processing.									17	1	0	0	2	0	17			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000427152800017

Here, spinel NiCo2O4 nanosheets grown on mildly oxidized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been synthesized via a simple one-pot solution method. Compared with pure NiCo2O4, the as-prepared hierarchical NiCo2O4/CNTs composite exhibits superior OER catalytic properties, i.e. a more negative onset potential, a smaller Tafel slope and higher stability, which may be attributed to the enhanced conductivity of the hybrid, originating from the carbon nanotube substrate. Furthermore, the surface Co/Ni ratio of NiCo2O4/CNTs is changed by the synergistic reactivity between oxygen-enriched groups and metal ions, which improves the catalytic performance of NiCo2O4/CNTs. This electrocatalyst with enhanced OER performance may be a promising candidate for water splitting.									165	11	0	0	4	0	168			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000361698600014

Here the catalytic performance of Fe-Co-N-C with different active sites, including FeCoN6, FeCoN7, and FeCoN8, towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is systematically studied by density functional theory calculations. We show that the stability and catalytic activity of Fe-Co-N-C for ORR and OER would be affected by the atomic-structures of active sites, and Fe-Co-N-C with active sites of FeCoN7 and FeCoN8 possess a better catalytic performance compared with FeCoN6. The top site of Co atom is the main active center responsible for ORR and OER in active sites of FeCoN7 and FeCoN8, in which the extremely low overpotential of 0.22 V for both ORR and OER can be obtained by regulating the atomic-structure of the active site. Importantly, we plot the relationship curve between the d-band center of Co atoms and overpotentials of ORR and OER on Fe-Co-N-C, which can link the atomic-structure of active sites to catalytic performance. These findings are great significance for the scientific design of efficient bifunctional catalysts.									32	2	0	0	1	0	32			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000541415400007

Enhancement of Anodically Treated Stainless Steel by NiFeP-Catalyst Electrodeposition as Bifunctional Electrodes for Water Electrolysis								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				169	4					044501	10.1149/1945-7111/ac5ff1				APR 1 2022	2022	Electrochemical water splitting, using bifunctional and easily scalable electrodes made of abundant materials, is one of the most important milestones towards the storage of intermittent energy generated from renewable sources. In this work, we demonstrated the synthesis of amorphous NiFeP catalysts for H-2 and O-2 evolution using a very simple and scalable electrodeposition method. Corrosion resistant stainless steel was used as substrate, which is subject of improvement by a facile anodic treatment in an electrolyte comprised of sulfuric acid and glycerol. This treatment increased the surface area approx. six-fold by dissolving parts of the stainless steel substrate. Electrodes with NiFeP catalyst supported on pretreated substrates reported overpotentials of 305 and 210 mV at divide 10 divide mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. The electrodes were stable for 24 h at a current density of 400 mA cm(-2), which resembles real operation for alkaline electrolyzers, with a slight increase in the overpotentials due to the accumulation of bubbles at the surface.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000777819500001

Herein, we report stoichiometric ternary-phase CoPS with a two-dimensional ultrathin porous nanosheet structure as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. Owing to the stable stoichiometric ternary phase, abundant octahedral Co3+ is observed in CoPS, serving as active sites to boost electrocatalytic activities. With the introduction of the ultrathin porous nanosheet structure, more active sites are exposed to enhance the electrochemical performance. Therefore, the samples display remarkable oxygen evolution activity with a low overpotential of 316 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 50.2 mV dec(-1). Combined with their highly efficient hydrogen evolution activity, CoPS ultrathin porous nanosheets are demonstrated to have extraordinary activities for overall water splitting, with a cell voltage of 1.57 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) current density. This work not only provides a bifunctional catalyst with outstanding performance, but also offers a facile route for improving electrocatalytic activity by synergistic morphology design and electronic modulation.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2196-0216			WOS:000471745700003

Although the impacts of either lattice strain or oxygen defects on the OER performance of oxide catalysts have been extensively investigated, the effects of both factors are normally treated separately. In this work, the coupled effects of both strain and oxygen deficiency on the electrocatalytic activity of La0.7Sr0.3CoO3- (LSC) thin films grown on single crystal substrates (LaAlO3 (LAO) and SrTiO3 (STO)) are investigated. Electrochemical tests show that the OER activities of LSC films are higher under compression than under tension, and are diminished as oxygen vacancies are introduced by vacuum annealing. Both experimental and computational results indicate that the LSC films under tension (e.g., LSC/STO) have larger oxygen deficiency than the films under compression (e.g., LSC/LAO), which attribute to smaller oxygen vacancy formation energy. Such strain-induced excessive oxygen vacancies in the LSC/STO increases the e(g) state occupancy and enlarges the energy gap between the O 2p and Co 3d band, resulting in lower OER activity. Understanding the critical role of strain-defect coupling is important for achieving the rational design of highly active and durable catalysts for energy devices.									88	4	0	0	7	0	90			2198-3844			WOS:000462613100019	30937267

Herein, well-dispersed Co3Fe7 nanoparticles encapsulated in porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (Co3Fe7-PCNF-850) are synthesized by employing polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as the pore-forming agent via simple electrospinning and subsequent calcination. The resulting Co3Fe7-PCNF-850 with well-dispersed bimetal nanoparticles and a porous structure shows a half-wave potential of 0.85 V (vs. RHE) comparable to 20 wt% Pt/C for the oxygen reduction reaction, enhanced stability with negligible attenuation after 1000 cycles, high methanol resistance, and low overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction. When Co3Fe7-PCNF-850 is employed as a cathode electrocatalyst, zinc-air batteries exhibit good cycling stability for 300 h and a high peak power density of 213 mW cm(-2) due to its excellent bifunctional catalytic activity. This work provides a simple strategy for the combination of hierarchically porous structures of carbon fibers with the optimized bifunctional activity of bimetal nanoparticles to improve battery performance.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2052-1537		WOS:000678220300001

Here, boron (B)-doped Co-N-C active sites confined in hierarchical porous carbon sheets (denoted as Co-N,B-CSs) were obtained by a soft template self-assembly pyrolysis method. Significantly, the introduced B element gives an electron deficient site that can activate the electron transfer around the Co-N-C sites, strengthen the interaction with oxygenated species, and thus accelerate reaction kinetics in the 4e(-) processed ORR and OER. As a result, the catalyst showed Pt-like ORR performance with a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.83 V versus (vs) RHE, a limiting current density of about 5.66 mA cm(-2), and higher durability (almost no decay after 5000 cycles) than Pt/C catalysts. Moreover, a rechargeable Zn-air battery device comprising this Co-N,B-CSs catalyst shows superior performance with an open-circuit potential of similar to 1.4 V, a peak power density of similar to 100.4 mW cm(-2), as well as excellent durability (128 cycles for 14 h of operation). DFT calculations further demonstrated that the coupling of Co-N-x active sites with B atoms prefers to adsorb an 02 molecule in side-on mode and accelerates ORR kinetics.									316	30	0	0	10	0	323			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000426615600102	29361224

The Super P (SP) was used to improve the electrical conductivity of the catalyst. The electrochemical measurements revealed a significant enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity of the MnO2/PCS towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) upon the Tween20 modification. The onset potentials of the OER at the Tween20 modified MnO2/PCS particles electrode are more negative by about 0.162 V compared with the bare (i.e. unmodified) MnO2/PCS electrode. Tween20 is absorbed on the surface of MnO2/PCS and covers the entire surface of the MnO2/PCS particles homogeneously. The Tween20 plays a vital role as a catalytic mediator, which facilitates the ion transfer during the water oxidation into molecular oxygen and thus the OER is accomplished at less positive potentials.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2046-2069			WOS:000344389000036

Its wide application suffers from high energy loss and sluggish reaction kinetics. The adoption of appropriate electrocatalysts is capable of reducing the over potential and accelerating the reaction. Present research mainly focuses on adjusting electrocatalysts, but the performances are also dependent on other parameters. Therefore, the development of an efficient strategy to enhance electrocatalytic performance through integrating with other driving force, especially a renewable driving force, is of great interest. Herein, we present a photothermal-effect-driven strategy to promote the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities of nickel/reduced graphene oxide (denoted as Ni/RGO) bifunctional electrocatalysts. The Ni/RGO composite exhibited significant enhancement of activities after exposure to light irradiation (49 mV and 50 mV decrease of overpotential at 10 mA/cm(2) for HER and OER, respectively). It was found that the improved electrocatalytic activities arose from the photothermal effect of Ni/RGO, which can efficiently facilitate the thermodynamics and kinetics of electrocatalytic reactions. Furthermore, the photothermal-effect-induced enhancement for electrocatalysis showed good stability, indicating its promising potential in practical application.									40	3	0	0	4	0	42			2168-0485			WOS:000459367400008

With the aim of developing an efficient bifunctional catalyst by tuning the electronic properties and local structure around the 3d metal in CoWO4, solid solutions of Co1-xMnxWO4 are investigated. Nanocrystalline Co1-xMnxWO4 (x=0 to 1) phases with a unique exposure of low surface energy planes are synthesized by hydrothermal methods. Replacing an optimum amount of Co with Mn to enhance the catalytic activity leads a observation of a negative shift in the Co2+/3+ redox wave and onset of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), indicating a strong electronic interaction between the two elements. The composition corresponding to Co0.5Mn0.5WO4 has demonstrated great ability to catalyze both the OER and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a combined overpotential of 0.89V. It exhibited an OER current density of 10mAcm(-2) at an overpotential of 400mV. Whereas ORR current density of 3mAcm(-2) is reached at a potential of 0.74V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The density functional theory revealed that the substitution of Mn in CoWO4 elevate the 3d metal d band center closer to the Fermi energy and hence ease the electron transfer to facilitate ORR and OER.									28	0	0	0	2	0	28			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000412656600009

However, they are associated with many disadvantages such as high cost, lower durability/selectivity and detrimental environmental effects; this motivates researchers to develop new electroactive materials. In this study, we presented the synthesis of a Co-containing metal-organic framework (Co-MOF) and explored its electrocatalytic application towards the oxygen electrocatalysis (i.e. the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction). The Co-MOF efficiently catalyzes the ORR with a lower onset (0.85 V vs. RHE)/reduction potential and higher reduction current density by a four-electron reduction path. Moreover, the MOF shows higher durability with >70% performance retention after 25 hours of reaction and tolerance towards methanol; this demonstrates its potential for application in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs); furthermore, due to the availability of more active sites and accessible surface area, the Co-MOF performs well towards the OER with lower onset potential and small Tafel slope as compared to the commercial RuO2 nanoparticles. Moreover, it needs only 280 mV overpotential to deliver the state-of-the-art current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and robust stability. It shows the high TOF value of 93.21 s(-1) at the overpotential of 350 mV as compared to the reported MOF/nanoparticle-based electrocatalysts and the state-of-the-art RuO2. Therefore, we believe that the as-developed Co-MOF holds the potential to be used as both a cathode and an anode electrocatalyst in the future energy storage and conversion systems.									72	2	0	0	5	0	72			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000476573300018	31215575

Carbon dot (C-dot) catalysts synthesized by microwave irradiation can trap an anti-oxidant, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (5-HMF) inside the carbon framework. The C-dot with the highest concentration of 5-HMF acts as a stable metal-free oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst which operates at a decently low 0.21(+/- 0.03) V overpotential and can generate current density up to 33.6(+/- 2.3) mA cm(-2). With increased microwave reaction time, the concentration of 5-HMF inside the C-dots decreases at the cost of different furan derivatives which decreases the OER activity. The 5-HMF molecules in close vicinity to the catalytically active sites containing C=O groups can extract the (OH)-O-center dot/(OOH)-O-center dot radicals and can increase the in situ H2O concentration to facilitate the forward reaction of O-2 evolution. During continuous electrolysis beyond 10 min, 5-HMF gets converted to 2,5-diformylfuran entities, which increases the catalytically active sites and thereby maintains the OER activity of the C-dots for at least 4 h. The ability of microwave irradiated sucrose derived C-dots to electro-oxidize water is generalized with C-dots and graphene dots (G-dots) prepared from different precursors.									34	0	0	0	1	0	34			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000385360300014

Therefore, in this study reported a facile one-step hydrothermal synthesis of ZnO nanorods. The structural and morphological properties of the synthesized sample have been studied through X-ray Diffraction analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscope, SEM-based Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. Electrochemical studies toward oxygen evolution reaction are evaluated via cyclic voltammetric measurements (CV) and linear sweep voltammetric (LSV) measurements. It has been found that ZnO-nanorods/nickel foam (NF) delivers benchmark 10 mA cm(-2) at just 340 mV overpotential, which is superior than previously reported oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. The overall findings of the current study provide a cost-effective and efficient synthesis of ZnO-nanorods for application as an electrocatalyst.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2470-1556	2470-1564		WOS:000617037000001

Metal-organic framework (MOF) template pyrolysis for the production of nanostructured carbon-based materials is a very promising methodology to produce carbon-based ECs. Herein, we report the preparation, characterization (XPS, CHNS analysis, ICP-OES, XRD, TEM, and SEM/EDS), and application as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) ECs of a plethora of nanostructured carbon materials derived from RT-synthesized (RT, room temperature) MOF-74 with different metal compositions, Co, Ni and Co/Ni, and dopant heteroatoms, N-, S- and N/S-dual-doping. This has allowed the study of the aforementioned parameters' influence on the OER and ORR electrocatalytic activity in alkaline medium. Highly synergetic effects have been detected in two cases: (1) when N/S-dual-doped carbon is produced from a monometallic Co-MOF-74 template, N,S-Co@C, and (2) when an undoped carbon is derived from bimetallic Co/Ni-MOF-74, Co/Ni@C. These two samples achieve OER performances with eta(10) = 0.41 and 0.44 V, respectively, along with Tafel slopes of 101 and 93 mV dec(-1), being close to the state-of-art OER catalyst performance. In addition, ORR tests showed that the effect of heteroatom doping on ORE, activity is always positive, regardless of metal composition.									43	2	0	0	2	0	43			2574-0962			WOS:000462944700033

Herein, we report rational construction of Mo doped Co4N nanoarrays (Mo-Co4N) with an open skeleton structure as a robust bifunctional electrocatalyst for concurrent electrolytic high-purity hydrogen and value-added formate productions in the cathodic and anodic process. Benefitting from Mo doping, the unique structure characteristics of more exposed active sites, and optimized electronic synergy, Mo-Co4N exhibits intriguing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with an exceptionally small overpotential of 45 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1). Meanwhile, when the anodic partial methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is used to replace the OER, the oxidation potential is significantly reduced to 1.356 V at 10 mA cm(-2). In particular, a two-electrode electrolyzer employing Mo-Co4N as a bifunctional catalyst only requires an ultralow cell voltage of 1.427 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), featuring low energy consumption in comparison to traditional overall water splitting. Furthermore, high Faraday efficiencies approaching 100% for hydrogen evolution and value-added formate production are achieved, as well as excellent 60 h long-term durability.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000691915900001		
J	Pan, Jing; Ma, Xiaoxue; Zhang, Wannian; Hu, Jingguo				wang, meng/GWZ-9558-2022				Enhancing the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of BiVO4 [110] facets using oxygen vacancies								RSC ADVANCES				12	1			540	545		10.1039/d1ra07121a				DEC 20 2021	2021	The activity of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) during photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting is limited when using BiVO4 with an exposed [110] facet because the conduction band minimum is below the H+/H2O potential. Here, we enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen production activity through introducing an oxygen vacancy. Our first-principles calculations show that the oxygen vacancy can tune the band edge positions of the [110] facet, originating from an induced internal electric field related to geometry distortion and charge rearrangement. Furthermore, the induced electric field favors photogenerated electron-hole separation and the enhancement of atomic activity. More importantly, oxygen-vacancy-induced electronic states can increase the probability of photogenerated electron transitions, thus improving optical absorption. This study indicates that oxygen-defect engineering is an effective method for improving the photocatalytic activity when using PEC technology.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2046-2069		WOS:000732849100001	35424485

Here, we demonstrate that the O-2 evolution reaction (OER) cocatalyst (CoOx) can dramatically improve the OER performance of the hexagonal alpha-Fe2O3 photoharvester. Although the pure hexagonal alpha-Fe2O3 is inert for water oxidation, the photocatalytic O-2 evolution rate of 5% CoOx /alpha-Fe2O3 is up to similar to 195.19 mu mol/g/h. The enhanced photocatalytic water oxidation performance can be ascribed to the effective separation of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs of alpha-Fe2O3 and the high transfer kinetics of the holes. The ESR results show that the introduction of CoO x does enhance the transfer and separation efficiency of the photogenerated carriers of the hexagonal alpha-Fe2O3. Additionally, the photocatalytic mechanism was also researched in detail.									33	2	0	0	3	0	33			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000454617200108

Here, ultralow platinum Pt@Ni@Pt core-bishell nanorods were designed (less than 1 wt % of Pt), synthesized, and characterized to yield bifunctional electrocatalysts with high efficiency toward ORR and OER in alkaline media. Ultralow platinum Pt@Ni@Pt core-bishell nanorods achieve an unprecedented (for a Pt-based catalyst) overpotential of 0.29 V at 10 mA cm-2 and current density of 162 mA mu g-1Pt at 1.6 V (vs RHE) for the OER, while still maintaining a very decent value of 0.32 A mg-1Pt at 0.85 V for the ORR. These values outperform the standard Pt catalyst for the ORR and the Ni catalyst for the OER, using less than 1 wt % Pt. We describe the twostep synthesis of the Pt@Ni@Pt nanorods, demonstrating the adjustment of their structural properties by a combination of dimethylformamide (DMF) and benzyl alcohol in a solvothermal reaction. We found that the solvent ratio controls the Pt-core size, Ni-shell thickness, and morphology. The combination of high performance and structure control via synthesis makes Pt@Ni@Pt nanorods promising candidates for further applications and opens a door for their further investigation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000813073300001

Herein, CFCO is applied as a cocatalyst of WO3 for the oxygen photoevolution reaction under visible light illumination. CFCO is synthesized by a sol-gel method and calcination at 873 K and loaded on a WO3 electrode by an electrophoretic deposition method. The photocatalytic activity of WO3 for the oxygen photoevolution reaction is improved by loading an appropriate amount of CFCO to reach a close level of RuO2/WO3 and Co-Pi/WO3. Furthermore, photocorrosion of WO3 is suppressed by CFCO loading, leading to high stability. Because both the lower edge of the conduction band and the upper edge of the valence band of CFCO are higher than those of WO3, only photoexcited holes at WO3 move to CFCO and easily react with water on the CFCO surface, leading to acceleration of the OER and suppressing of photocorrosion of WO3.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000682728000001

Utilization of PEM-electrolyser technology can explain that the performance is better in electrolyser configuration. Operating temperature slightly improves the yields. For photobiological applications, the cell would be used as oxygen regulator of the CO2 enriched vapor phase. The present investigation validates that the presence of CO2 in air stream does not affect the cell performance. Steady voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy performed for the two configurations allow to deduce, in a first part, kinetics of oxygen evolution in electrolyser mode, considering hydrogen evolution from the literature. The case of mixed cell operation was thereafter considered, using the deduced law for the anode. Subtracting the anode part from the overall response of the cell led to estimate for the kinetic law of oxygen reduction. The cathode resistance calculated from the law is in good agreement with the cathode resistance determined from EIS.					10th European Symposium on Electrochemical Engineering10th European Symposium on Electrochemical Engineering	SEP 28-OCT 02, 2014SEP 28-OCT 02, 2014	Italian Assoc Chem EngnItalian Assoc Chem Engn	Chia, ITALYChia, ITALY	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2283-9216		978-88-95608-32-7	WOS:000346539800044

As the most promising electrocatalysts, the OER performances of nickel-iron-based materials can be further improved by introducing metalloid elements to modify their electron structures. Herein, we developed an efficient hybrid electrocatalyst with nickel-iron boride (NiFeB) as core and amorphous nickel-iron borate (NiFeB,) as shell (NiFeB@NiFeB,) via a simple aqueous reduction. The obtained NiFeB@NiFeB, exhibits a small overpotential of 237 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and Tafel slope of 57.65 mV/dec in 1.0 mol/L KOH, outperforming most of the documented precious-metal-free based electrocatalysts. Benefiting from the in situ formed amorphous NiFeBi layer, it shows excellent stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). These findings might provide a new way to design advanced precious-metal-free electrocatalysts for OER and the application of electrochemical water splitting.

Nevertheless, the naturally torpid property of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics and poor stability of its catalysts significantly restrict the development of electrochemical water splitting. Here, a Ru0.6Cr0.4O2 electrocatalyst is synthesized, which reveals excellent OER activity with the overpotential of only 195 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent stability with the potential increase of merely 5.3 mV after 20 h continuous OER test in acidic media. Theoretical calculations reveal that the solubilizing of Cr into RuO2 could adjust the electron distribution, making the d-band center of Ru far away from the Fermi level. This behavior reduces the binding energy with Ru and O and accelerates the rate-determining step of OER (i.e., the formation of *OOH), thereby increasing OER activity. In addition, the incorporation of Cr increases the energy of oxygen defect formation and reduces the participation of lattice oxygen, thus improving the stability of the catalyst. This research furnishes a feasible policy for the development of highly active and stable catalysts in acidic media by regulating the electronic structure of RuO2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2366-9608			WOS:000829521800001	35879051

Herein, the critical role of oxidizing the vacancies in enhancing the oxygen reduction reaction for metal-air battery is identified with density functional theory. Deliberate introduction of oxygen-enriched vacancies in nitrogen-doped carbon is shown experimentally to provide superior oxygen reduction activity. In situ X-ray powder diffraction gives direct observation of the oxygen reactions in a zinc-air battery catalyzed by vacancy-enriched oxidized carbon; the intensity changes of the carbon peak show continuous chemisorption of oxygen intermediates on the carbon cathode during discharge. The air-cathode performance is shown to exceed that with Pt/C+IrO2 catalysts.									46	2	0	0	4	0	46			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000457802000009	30515889

Here, we report a new strategy to in-situ prepare La2O3-nitrogen doped carbon tubes (NCNTs) hybrids by one step calcination treatment with LaNi0.9Fe0.1O3 perovskite oxides as precursors, sugar as carbon sources and urea as nitrogen sources. The contents of applied LaNi0.9Fe0.1O3 oxides affect the formation of NCNTs, and the obtained NCNTs have abundant wrinkles on the surface. In alkaline solution, the LO-NF-NCNTs-1.0 sample catalyzes the ORR with an onset potential of 0.896 V (vs. RHE) and a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.772 V (vs. RHE), which is only an E-1/2 gap of 65 mV compared with commercial Pt/C catalyst. Meanwhile, the LO-NF-NCNTs-1.0 sample exhibits better OER activities than the commercial RuO2 catalyst. Significantly, we demonstrate that the LO-NF-NCNTs-1.0 sample possesses surprisingly catalytic stabilities, and an outstanding tolerance towards methanol crossover. The excellent bifunctional activities may be attributed to the typical morphology of NCNTs, coupling effect between NCNTs and La2O3 because of the formation of active La-O and C-O bonds.

To slow down the agglomeration of transition metal atoms during high-temperature treatments, herein, organics with coordination functions are proposed to regulate the typical metal-organic framework compound ZIF-67 with rich Co atoms. Electron microscopy structural charac-terization proves that ZIF-67 modified by coordinated organic compounds, including ascorbic acid (AA), citric acid (CA) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EA), greatly improves the dispersibility of cobalt in the final product. All the adjusted ZIF-67 can derive cobalt-based bifunctional oxygen catalysts with higher activity. Among them, EA-MOF-Co shows the best ORR performance, with a half-wave potential comparable to commercial Pt/C in alkaline solutions and an obviously reduced oxygen evolution overpotential. This suggests that it is an effective method for use of coordination organics to tether metal ions and prevent their further agglomeration during carbonation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000841965500004

Additionally, inadequate understanding of the key barriers of the OER is a hindrance to insightful design of advanced OER catalysts. This study presents ultrathin amorphous high-surface area nickel boride (NixB) nanosheets as a low-cost, very efficient and stable catalyst for the OER for electrochemical water splitting. The catalyst affords 10 mA cm(-2) at 0.38 V overpotential during OER in 1.0 m KOH, reducing to only 0.28 V at 20 mA cm(-2) when supported on nickel foam, which ranks it among the best reported nonprecious catalysts for oxygen evolution. Operando X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy measurements reveal prevalence of NiOOH, as well as Ni-B under OER conditions, owing to a Ni-B core@ nickel oxyhydroxide shell (Ni-B@NiOxH) structure, and increase in disorder of the NiOxH layer, thus revealing important insight into the transient states of the catalyst during oxygen evolution.									256	14	0	0	12	0	260			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000409410000027

The high-aspect-ratio single crystalline WO3 nanoneedles (NNs) act as both the photoanode framework and the light harvester in the UV and blue visible region. The porous layer of small alpha-Fe2O3 nanocrystals act as a cooperative light harvester in the visible region. The WO3 NNs/alpha-Fe2O3 heterojunction photoanodes exhibit an extended light absorption band in the visible region and a significantly enhanced photocurrent density, which is ca. 1.6 times higher than that obtained on the pure WO3 NNs. Cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) was employed as an oxygen evolving catalyst to modify the heterojunction electrode, and the resulting WO3 NNs/alpha-Fe2O3/Co-Pi composite photoanodes show an excellent photostability for oxygen evolution reaction.

Here a new class of bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts has been developed based on ultrafine transition metal-oxide nanoparticles (NPs), such as NiO, FeO or NiFeO, embedded in an amorphous MnOx shell, where the embedded NP core contributes to the high OER activity and the porous amorphous MnOx shell functions as an effective ORR catalyst as well as providing effective structural confinement to the metal-oxide NP core. The best performance was obtained for NiFeO@ MnOx, exhibiting a potential gap, Delta E, of 0.798 V to achieve a current of 3 mA cm(-2) for the ORR and 5 mA cm(-2) for the OER in 0.1 M KOH solution, better than that of Ir/C (0.924 V) and Pt/C (1.031 V). Most importantly, NiFeO@MnOx shows superior stability due to the outstanding structural confinement effect of the amorphous MnOx, achieving a Delta E of 0.881 V after 300 cycles, outperforming 1.093 V obtained for the state-of-the-art Ir-Pt/C oxygen electrocatalysts.									35	4	0	0	4	0	36			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000384238900024

Here, the performance of IrO2 nanoparticles formed and deposited in situ onto carbon nitride support for PEM water electrolysis was explored based on previous preliminary studies conducted in related systems. The results revealed that this preparation route catalyzed the decomposition of the carbon nitride to form a material with much lower N content. This resulted in a significant enhancement of the performance of the gCNH-IrO2 (or N-doped C-IrO2) electrocatalyst that was likely attributed to higher electrical conductivity of the N-doped carbon support.									13	1	0	0	1	0	14			2079-4991			WOS:000436505200077	29899292

Used as an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst for water splitting, the catalytic performance (an overpotential of 270 mV@10 mA cm(-2) and no decay within 30 h) of Co3O4-delta-QDs is superior to that of previously reported Co-based catalysts and the state-of-the-art IrO2. Compared to that of the Co3O4 nanosheets, the enhanced OER activity of Co3O4-delta-QDs is attributed to two factors: one is the increased quantity of the Faradaic active sites, including the total active sites (q*(Total)), the most accessible active sites (q*Outer), and their ratio (q*(Outer)/q*(Total)); the other is the enhanced intrinsic electroactivity per active site evaluated by the turnover frequency and the current density normalized by the most accessible active sites (j/q*(Outer).) related to the OER. This multicycle lithiation/delithiation method can be applied to other transition metal oxides as well, offering a general approach to develop highperformance electrocatalysts for water splitting.									85	2	0	0	1	0	86			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000401782500027	28447457

SEM results show that a micro/nanocomposite with an urchin-like morphology has been obtained. The as-synthesized LSM perovskite oxide has a high specific surface area of 48 m(2) g(-1). The catalytic activity of the oxide for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 0.1 M KOH solution has been studied by using a rotating-ring-disk electrode (RRDE). In the ORR test, a maximum cathodic current density of 5.2 mA cm(-2) at -1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) with 2500 rpm was obtained, and the ORR mainly favors a direct four-electron pathway. The results of anodic linear scanning voltammograms indicate that the urchin-like LSM perovskite oxide exhibits an encouraging catalytic activity for the OER. All electrochemical measurements suggest that the urchin-like LSM perovskite oxide could be used as a bifunctional catalyst for the ORR and the OER. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The bifunctional TiN@Ni3N nanowire arrays serve as both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reaction evolution (OER) catalysts in this device. As a hydrogen evolution catalyst, the TiN@Ni3N nanowire arrays possess an onset overpotential of 15 mV vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), a Tafel slope of 42.1 mV dec(-1), and an excellent stability of <13% degradation after being operated for 10 h, much better than Pt disks and Ni3N nanosheets in alkaline electrolytes. For oxygen evolution performance, the Myriophyllum-like TiN@Ni3N nanowire arrays exhibit an onset potential of 1.52 V vs. RHE, and a high stability of 72.1% current retention after being measured for 16 h in the potentiostatic mode. Furthermore, a symmetric electrochemical water splitting device was assembled by using the Myriophyllum-like TiN@Ni3N nanowire arrays as two electrodes, possessing a water splitting onset of similar to 1.57 V with a current retention of 63.8% after 16 h of operation.									109	3	0	0	3	0	109			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000374790400042

In this study, BaTiO3@Metal (BTO@M, M=Pt, Pd and Au) hetero-nanostructures were synthesized by using a piezodeposition method. The deposited metal cocatalysts significantly promote the separation and migration of piezogenerated charge, consequently enhancing the piezocatalytic reactions on different metal cocatalyst interfaces. Specifically, BTO@Au under ultrasonic vibrations exhibited most efficient generation of reactive oxidative species via a two-electron reduction pathway in the presence of dissolved oxygen, while BTO@Pt showed promoted hydrogen evolution in the absence of oxygen. The metal-piezoelectric hetero-nanostructures proposed in this work highlight the key role of noble metal as cocatalysts for piezoelectricity-driven oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions, which could further advance piezocatalysis in the field of clean energy, water disinfection and biomedicine.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000802837400001

Cobalt-containing spinel oxides are promising candidates for OER, but suffer from cation deficiency during OER, because of the high stability and reversibility of the spinel structure. Herein, we combine catalytically inactive CeO2 and spinel structure Co3O4 (CeO2/Co3O4) by a built-in p-n heterojunction. The strongly coupled p-n heterojunction interface allows a rapid interfacial charge transfer from CeO2 to Co3O4, which leads to a high concentration of oxygen vacancies and the generation of Co2+ octahedral (Co2+(O-h)) sites from the reduction of Co3+(O-h) at the CeO2/Co3O4 interface. Consequently, the CeO2/Co3O4 interface with the optimal ratio of Ce/Co exhibits high OER activity with an overpotential of only 265 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 68.1 mV dec(-1), and long-term durability in an alkaline medium.									166	13	0	0	11	0	166			2155-5435			WOS:000474812400067

In the present work, a novel porous NiO/NiCo2O4 heterostructure is constructed by two-stage calcination of nickel-cobalt bimetallic hydroxide precursors prepared using a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method, in which abundant interfaces are constituted. The NiO phase stabilized in NiCo2O4 matrix is the nanometer scale (ca. 13 nm). The porous nanoscale NiO/NiCo2O4 heterostructure shows a 10 mA cm(-2) current density under the overpotential of 264 mV which outperforms the noble catalyst RuO2. It is demonstrated that the highly active Ni3+ species generated by the oxidation of nanometer scale NiO surface are responsible for enhanced OER. Additionally, DFT calculations certify that the heterostructure interfaces promote the chemisorption of OH intermediates. This strategy of increasing the intrinsic activity and improving the chemisorption abilities for oxygen-containing intermediates by constructing nanoscale heterostructure electrocatalysts provides a feasible method to accelerate the reaction rate of OER.

With the well-dispersed Pd/Pd4S nanoparticles, the hierarchical composite with large specific surface area offers favorable transport channels for ions, electron and oxygen. Especially, the Pd/Pd4S nanoparticles could exhibit excellent electrochemical performance for ORR and OER due to their intrinsic catalytic property and interfacial effect from the heterostructure. Therefore, the LOBs with Pd/Pd4S@HCS as cathode catalyst show improved specific capacities, good rate ability and stable cycling performance.

Here we show a simple method to fabricate nickel nitride (Ni3N) on nickel (Ni) foam for electrocatalytic applications. The Ni3N/Ni-foam exhibits extremely low overpotential (similar to 50 mV), high current density and excellent stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution. In addition, the modified foam demonstrates enhanced activity in the oxygen evolution (OER) and reduction (ORR) reaction compared to original Ni-foam. The activity enhancement can be attributed to the facile formation of a Ni(OH)(2) layer on the nitride layer due to improved lattice matching. The formation of the Ni3N/Ni(OH)(2) catalyst results in lower overpotentials due to easier water dissociation on the nickel hydroxide layer. In addition, the HER is further improved due to stronger adsorption of hydrogen to the metal nitride than to the pure metal. We believe that the utilization of nickel nitride as an electrocatalyst opens opportunities for energy-related devices such as batteries and fuel cells.									319	9	0	0	6	0	324			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000352441100062

The products were then etched using the HF solution to prepare the modified porous silicon (PSi) compounds of (Ni3S2PSi)-P-(a) and (Ni3S2B)-B-(a)-PSiF. Electrochemical studies showed that Ni3S2(a)-SiF and (Ni3S2B)-B-(a)-PSiF were not only durable but also exhibited electrocatalytic activity toward both alkaline and acidic hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) with appropriate Tafel slopes of 74 and 52 mV dec(-1), respectively. Moreover, they recorded an electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an overpotential of 164 mV dec(-1). Based on the electrocatalytic studies, the (Ni3S2B)-B-(a)-PSiF electrocatalyst was found to have the best electrocatalytic behavior toward HER and OER. The isolated island architecture of the bi-functional (i.e., HER and OER) electrocatalyst could act as promising electrode materials for water splitting using electrochemical methods.

This process distinguishes itself by breaking the water molecule (water splitting) through two semi-reactions: Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER, cathodic reaction) and Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER, anodic reaction). The OER is fundamental for several electrochemical technologies related to generate and store energy. New research for developing low-cost electrocatalysts with a good electrochemical activity using more earth-abundant elements has intensified in recent years. The current work aims to study the effect of Fe doping on the OER of calcium cobaltites, Ca3Co4-xFexO9 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.4, and 0.8). Powders were obtained by a proteic sol-gel method using gelatin with calcination at 900 degrees C for 2 h. The resultant samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) provided information on the surface chemical states, while Mo.ssbauer spectroscopy indicated that Fe has a strong preference for octahedral sites in the CoO2 layer rather than in the Ca2CoO3 layer in the calcium cobaltite misfit-type structure. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to analyze the electrochemical performance. The results indicate that Ca3Co3.2Fe0.8O9 needs the lowest overpotential of 320 mV to generate a current density of 10 mA cm-2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000684292400005

This paper reports the development of a lightweight carbon-based bifunctional air electrode, catalysed by a small (0.5 mg cm(-2)) loading of 30 wt.% palladium on carbon. The Pd-catalysed air electrode showed good bifunctional activity, with 0.53 V potential difference between oxygen reduction and evolution. The Pd/C air electrode showed improved catalytic activity at high current densities (>= 50 mA cm(-2)) and enhanced durability compared with two commercial Pt/C air electrodes produced by Gaskatel GmbH and Johnson Matthey. A stable oxygen evolution potential was maintained over 1,000 charge-discharge cycles. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Yamane, Y; Kashino, Y; Koike, H; Satoh, K								Effects of high temperatures on the photosynthetic systems in spinach: Oxygen-evolving activities, fluorescence characteristics and the denaturation process								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				57	1			51	59		10.1023/A:1006019102619				JUL 1998	1998	Activities of oxygen evolution, fluorescence F-v (a variable part of chlorophyll fluorescence) values, and amounts of the 33 kDa protein remaining bound to the thylakoids in intact spinach chloroplasts were measured during and after high-temperature treatment. The following results were obtained. (1) Both the F-v value and the flash-induced oxygen evolution measured by an oxygen electrode were decreased at high temperatures, but they showed partial recovery when the samples were cooled down and incubated at 25 degrees C for 5 min after high-temperature treatment. (2) Oxygen evolution was more sensitive to high temperatures than the F-v value, and the decrease in the F-v/F-m ratio at high temperatures rather corresponded to that in the oxygen evolution measured at 25 degrees C after high-temperature treatment. (3) Photoinactivation of PS II was very rapid at high temperatures, and this seems to be a cause of the difference between the F-v values and the oxygen-evolving activities at high temperatures. (4) At around 40 degrees C, the manganese-stabilizing 33 kDa protein of PS II was supposed to be released from the PS II core complexes during heat treatment and to rebind to the complexes when the samples were cooled down to 25 degrees C. (5) At higher temperatures, the charge separation reaction of PS II was inactivated, and the PS II complexes became less fluorescent, which was recovered partially at 25 degrees C. (6) Increases in the F-v value due to a large decrease in the electron flow from Q(A) to Q(B) became prominent after high-temperature treatment at around 50 degrees C. This was the main cause of the discrepancy between the F-v values and the oxygen-evolving activities measured at 25 degrees C. Relationship between the process of heat inactivation of PS II reaction center complexes and the fluorescence levels is discussed.									153	26	2	0	148	4	184			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000075544900004

Ni2P/Ni(PO3)(2) was highly dispersed in carbon nanosheets and supplied fruitful of exposed active sites, and thus endowed the as-prepared samples highly electrocatalytic activities for water splitting. In addition, the N/S self-doped carbon protected Ni2P/Ni(PO3)(2) from corrosion by the electrolyte and greatly enhanced the stabilities of the catalysts. As a result, the optimized composite 1:8-NPO/NS-C-420, derived from the precursor with 1:8 molar ratio of MO/Ni(II) and phosphorized at 420 degrees C, has exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activities for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and overall water splitting. As a result, 88 mV and 273 mV overpotential was obtained for HER and OER at 10 mA/cm(2) in acidic and alkaline electrolyte, respectively. As for the overall water splitting, only 1.63 V of cell voltage is needed to reach 10 mA/cm(2). The catalyst also exhibited high longterm stability in HER, OER and water splitting.

The utmost possible form of artificial photosynthesis is a two-step photoexcitation known as "Z-scheme", which mimics the natural photosystem. This process solely relies on the effective coupling and suitable band positions of semiconductors (SCs) and redox mediators for the purpose to catalyze the surface chemical reactions and significantly deter the backward reaction. In recent years, the Z-scheme strategies and their key role have been studied progressively through experimental approaches. In addition, theoretical studies based on density functional theory have provided detailed insight into the mechanistic aspects of some breathtakingly complex problems associated with hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. In this context, this critical review gives an overview of the fundamentals of Z-scheme photocatalysis, including both theoretical and experimental advancements in the field of photocatalytic water splitting, and suggests future perspectives.									35	1	0	0	1	0	35			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000704566000001	34617345

They are, therefore, promising candidates for the air-cathode in metal-air rechargeable batteries. Since the activity of a catalyst is highly dependent on its specific surface area, nanoparticles of the perovskite catalyst are desirable for catalyzing both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. Herein, LaCoO3 powder was also prepared by sol-gel method for comparison, with a broad particle distribution and high agglomeration. The electro catalytic properties of LaCoO3 and LaCoO3-carbon Super P mixture layers toward the ORR were studied comparatively using the rotating disk electrode technique in 0.1M KOH electrolyte to elucidate the effect of carbon Super P. Koutecky-Levich theory was applied to acquire the overall electron transfer number (n) during the ORR, calculated to be similar to 3.74 for the LaCoO3-Super P mixture, quite close to the theoretical value (4.0), and similar to 2.7 for carbon-free LaCoO3. A synergistic effect toward the ORR is observed when carbon is present in the LaCoO3 layer. Carbon is assumed to be more than an additive, enhancing the electronic conductivity of the oxide catalyst. It is suggested that ORRs, catalyzed by the LaCoO3-Super P mixture, are dominated by a 2+ 2-electron transfer pathway to form the final, hydroxyl ion product.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2093-8551			WOS:000377550600003

Herein, we construct Co9S8 nanoflakes decorated Co3O4 nanoarrays with enriched heterogeneous interface zones on Ni foam (Co9S8 @Co3O4/NF) via a novel step-wise approach. The Co9S8@Co3O4/NF hybrid manifests excellent performance with low overpotentials of 130 mV for HER (10 mA.cm(-2)) and 331 mV for OER (100 mA.cm(-2)), delivering a small voltage of 1.52 V for water splitting at 10 mA.cm(-)(2) as well as outstanding catalytic durability, which surpasses precious metals and previously reported earth-abundant nanocatalysts. Further experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that the excellent performance is attributed to the followings: (i) Highly conductive Ni facilitates the efficient charge transfer; (ii) porous core-shell nanoarchitecture benefits the infiltration and transportation of gases/ions; (iii) heterogeneous interface zones synergistically lower the chemisorption energy of hydrogen/oxygen intermediates. This work will shed light on the controllable synthesis and engineering of heterostructure nanomaterials for clean energy storage and conversion technologies.									10	1	0	0	0	0	11			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000686487500007

A simple and effective precursor of ZIF-67 particles mounted on Cu(OH)(2) nanorods was induced by a template alignment method. After annealing, hierarchical CoO polyhedron-decorated CuO/Cu2O (CuOx) nanorods on Cu foam (denoted as CuOx@CoO NRs/CF) were achieved, which displayed the heterojunction in CuOx components, hierarchical configuration and outward active sites. These features, verified by HRTEM, SEM, XPS and EDX, optimized the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst. Benefiting from its large electrochemical surface area and the synergetic effect between CuOx and CoO, CuOx@CoO NRs/CF exhibited considerable catalytic activity with a low overpotential of 254 mV to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte and a scarce loss of the initial catalyst activity over 24 h and over 5000 cycles.

Herein, cobalt and nickel (Co and Ni) selenide nanowalls have been prepared on a conductive graphene coated Ni mesh substrate and used as electrocatalysts for hydrogen generation and oxygen evolution. The bifunctional CoSe nanowalls showed a high electrochemically active surface area, which manifested a low onset potential and high structural stability for overall water splitting. It afforded a 10 mA cm(-2) current density at -78 mV vs. RHE for the hydrogen evolution reaction and 150 mA cm(-2) at 1.74 V vs. RHE for the oxygen evolution reaction. No significant degradation was observed after a 24 h chronoamperometric test. A solar water electrolysis system was constructed by connecting the CoSe (+) and CoSe (-) pair with a photovoltaic cell in tandem, which showed a highest solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 6.65%. Its superior performance over industrial water electrolyzers provided a new possibility towards clean energy storage and utilization.									122	6	0	0	4	0	123			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000385360300032

Perovskite oxides have attracted considerable interests in view of the highly tunable structural, electronic, and catalytic properties associated with their compositions. Herein, an efficient Sn-incorporated nominal perovskite nanocomposite, SrCo0.7Sn0.3O3-delta (SCS), derived from a facile one-pot self-assembly process, is designed as an outstanding electrocatalyst to catalyze OER in alkaline conditions. Benefiting from the unique structure, increased active oxygen intermediates, and favorable electrical conductivity, the optimized SCS exhibits superior OER electrocatalytic performance, including low overpotential of only 309 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), fast kinetics with a small Tafel slope of 56 mV dec(-1), and 72-fold improvement in mass activity and 108-fold enhancement in specific activity relative to the pristine SrCoO3-delta catalyst.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance, OER process kinetics, stability, and the causes of enhanced OER performances of NiFeA/CPE were investigated. The experiment results showed that NiFeA/CPE displayed a highly efficient catalytic activity for OER and delivered a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with an overpotential of 280 mV in 1 M KOH. The enhanced OER performance was due to its high active surface areas and low charge transfer resistance. The as-prepared NiFeA/CPE for OER possesses the traits of low cost, easy preparation, high activity, and durable stability.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000480597700032

Moreover, we found that O-N-Co9S8 was completely converted into Co3O4 after OER, showing oxide is actual active phase. Density functional theory calculations reveal the continuous exposure of oxidized surface Co sites during O-N-Co9S8 -> Co3O4 is essential for its high OER activity. These Co sites promote the kinetics for OH* transformation to O* and also ensure fast O-2 desorption. Once Co3O4 is generated, the high activity is contributed by its resulting characteristic surfaces.

Targeting on this issue, herein we report an electronic structure modulating strategy by dispersing RuO2 over defective TiO2 enriched with oxygen vacancies (RuO2/D-TiO2). Synergetic (spectro-)electrochemistry and theoretical simulations reveal a continuous band structure at the interface between RuO2 and defective TiO2, as well as a lowered energetic barrier for *OOH formation, which are accountable for the largely enhanced acidic OER kinetics. As a result, the as-prepared RuO2/D-TiO2 catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 180 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a low cell voltage of 1.84 V at 2 A cm(-2), and a long lifetime above 100 h at 200 mA cm(-2), providing hints for a more robust acidic OER catalyst design.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000832181700001

Searching for stable, highly active, and low-cost multifunctional catalysts has become a critical issue. In this study, we report the synthesis of IrO2-ZnO hybrid nanoparticles and their highly efficient electrocatalytic. activities toward oxygen/hydrogen evolution reaction (OER/HER) as well as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). For comparison, we synthesized RuO2-ZnO, showing a smaller catalytic activity than IrO2-ZnO, which provides robust evidence for the unique synergic effect of these hybrid structures. IrO2-ZnO and RuO2-ZnO exhibit excellent OER catalytic performance with Tafel slopes of 57 and 59 mV decade(-1), respectively. For HER, IrO2-ZnO shows a higher catalytic activity than RuO2-ZnO. The numbers of electrons involved in the ORR were 3,7 and 2.8, respectively, for IrO2-ZnO and RuO2-ZnO. The remarkable catalytic performance of IrO2-ZnO would be ascribed to the abundant oxygen vacancies and the metallic states of Ir, which ensure excellent catalytic activity and stability.									31	1	0	0	2	0	31			1932-7447			WOS:000405761600058

In this study,a heteroatoms doped carbon (HDC) supported Co_2P nanoparticles (Co_2P-HDC) bi-functional electrocatalyst was prepared via a facile one step pyrolysis in molten salt with hen's egg yolk and cobalt chloride as precursor.

Herein, employing graphitic carbon nitride as carbon precursor, N-doped carbon sheets loaded with Ni3Fe nanoparticles (denoted as Ni3Fe/N-C) have been prepared via a simple pyrolysis strategy. Benefitting from the introduction of triethylene diamine as organic ligand, Ni3Fe nanoparticles with a mean size of 29 nm are dispersed on N-C sheets uniformly. As a result, Ni3Fe/N-C exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity toward both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (For oxygen reduction reaction, the half-wave potential of Ni3Fe/N-C is 0.81 V; for oxygen evolution reaction, the overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) is 310 mV). Finally, when used as air electrode in rechargeable Zn-air battery, a high power density of 128 mW cm(-2) and a long cycling life up to 134 h at 10 mA cm(-2) are achieved. Our study thus provides a promising air electrode material for rechargeable Zn-air batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here we report a high-performance bifunctional catalyst for both ORR and OER in both alkaline and neutral media, which is made of cobalt-embedded nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes. In OER, it shows an overpotential of 200 mV in 0.1 M KOH and 300 mV in neutral media, while the current density reaches 50 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media and 10 mA cm(-2) in neutral media at overpotential of 300 mV. In ORR, it is on par with Pt/C in both alkaline and neutral media in terms of overpotential, but its stability is superior. Further study demonstrated that the high performance can be attributed to the coordination of N to Co and the concomitant structural defects arising from the transformation of cobalt-phthalocyanine precursor.									134	7	0	0	13	0	134			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000350193000022	25650772

The catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 295 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), with a Tafel slope of 53.7 mV dec(-1) as well as promising long-term stability. The attractive performance can be attributed to the increased amount of high valence Ni3+ species, together with the improved adsorption ability of oxygenic species on the material surface, due to the contribution of the multi-metallic element doping strategy in high entropy spinel oxide. DFT calculation results prove that the covalency of the metal-oxygen bond is enhanced in the high entropy oxide, which is beneficial for the OER catalysis. The DOS profile analysis and different charge density mapping results further reveal the multi-metal synergistic contribution to the oxygen evolution reaction. This study provides a reference method for the design and development of high-entropy spinel oxides with excellent OER properties.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000840432600001

The iron (Fe)-based oxyhydroxide materials for OER catalysts by LOM is well known. However, dissolution of Fe atoms and promoting participation level of lattice oxygen at a practical and extremely high current density (> 1000 mA cm(-2) for oxygen generation) should be resolved for high performance and long-term stability. Here, controlling the reduction of synthetic intermediates allowed amorphous BiFe (oxy)hydroxides with secondary bismuth (Bi) metal (BM/BiFeOxHy) heterogeneous structures with abundant lattice vacancies to be obtained. The BM/BiFeOxHy electrode exhibited low overpotential of 232 and 359 mV at a current density of 10 and 1000 mA cm-2, respectively. Moreover, the balanced hybridization of Bi/Fe-O was demonstrated to result in long-term catalytic stability without the dissolution of Fe atoms up to 1000 h at the extremely high current density of 1000 mA cm-2 with negligible degradation. We further showed that the excellent performance of the newly proposed BM/BiFeOxHy electrocatalysts is attributed to the utilization of Fe/ Bi-O hybridization, the induced amorphous structure, and increased lattice vacancies, which are systematically demonstrated by the electrochemical and physicochemical analysis and theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000854099600001

Despite many studies on various compositions, the correlation between the structure of the oxygen octahedra and electrocatalytic property has been overlooked, and there accordingly have been a very limited number of attempts regarding control of atomistic structure. Utilizing epitaxial LnNiO(3) (Ln = La, Pr, Nd) thin films, here we demonstrate that simple electrochemical exchange of Fe in the surface region with several-unit-cell thickness is notably effective to boost the catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction by different orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we directly establish that strong distortion of oxygen octahedra at the angstrom scale is readily induced during the Fe exchange, and that this structural perturbation permits easier charge transfer. The findings suggest that structural alteration can be an efficient approach to achieve exceptional electrocatalysis in crystalline oxides.									59	0	0	0	9	0	60			2041-1723			WOS:000472140100010	31221958

The excellent OER performance of Co3O4-Ag@B is attributed into two main reasons. First, the conductive Ag-nanoparticles on borophene facilitate the growth of thin Co3O4 nanoplates based on an epitaxy model that greatly enhances the population of Co3O4 catalyst sites on the surface. In the meantime, Ag nanoparticles increase the electrical conductivity of the support, facilitating electrons-transfer from Co-III atoms to form catalytically-active Co-IV sites. Second, the B atoms strongly interact with Co and O atoms on the Co3O4 nanoplates, greatly reducing the energy barrier of OER rate-determining procedure and increasing their stability on borophene supports. The Co3O4-Ag@B requires an overpotential of 270 mV and exhibits a Tafel-slope of 62 mV dec(-1) to deliver an oxygen-evolving current-density of 10 mA cm(-2), indicating 60 mV lower overpotential and 27 mV dec(-1 )lower Tafel-slop value than the Co3O4-Ag@rGO catalysts.									37	2	0	0	5	0	37			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000696918200008

The optimal prepared Co1Ni1@N-C material at 800 degrees C exhibited well-defined porosities, uniform CoNi alloy nanoparticle dispersion, a high doped-N level, and scattered CoNi-N-x active sites, therefore affording excellent oxygen catalytic activities toward the reduction and evolution processes of oxygen. The oxygen reduction (ORR) onset potential (E-onset) on Co1Ni1@N-C was 0.91 V and the half-wave potential (E-1/2) was 0.82 V, very close to the parameters recorded on the Pt/C (20 wt Pt%) benchmark. Moreover, it is worth noting that the ORR stability of Co1Ni1@N-C was prominently higher than that of Pt/C. Under the oxygen evolution reaction condition, Co1Ni1@N-C generated the maximum current density at the potential of 1.7 V (8.60 mA cm(-2)) and the earliest E-onset (1.35 V) among all CoxNiy@N-C hybrids. The Co1Ni1@N-C catalyst exhibited the smallest Delta E value, confirming the superior bifunctional activity. The high surface area and porosity, and CoNi-N-x active sites on the carbon surface including the proper interactions between the N-doped C shell and CoNi nanoparticles were attributed as the main contributors to the outstanding oxygen electrocatalytic property and good stability.									91	7	0	0	4	0	92			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000456351100025	30574774

By simply controlling the annealing conditions, phase transformation of CoSe2 from the orthorhombic phase to the cubic phase has been realized. Benefitting from the metallic character, the cubic phase CoSe2 shows greatly enhanced electrocatalytic activity for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The as-prepared cubic phase CoSe2 electrode possesses onset overpotentials of 43 and 200 mV, and Tafel slopes of 51 and 83 mV dec(-1) for HER and OER, respectively, which are remarkably superior to that of the orthorhombic phase CoSe2 catalyst and comparable to those of commercial noble-metal catalysts. In addition, the cubic phase CoSe2 electrode also demonstrates excellent stability after long-term operations. Our work not only provides a high performance catalyst for water splitting, but also introduces a new route to the design of a highly efficient catalyst by phase transformation.									21	1	0	0	0	0	21			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000405580300001	28598332

Unfortunately, effective methods for generating a high amount of oxygen vacancies on the surface of various nanocatalysts are rather limited. Here, we described an effective way to generate oxygen-vacancy-rich surface of transition metal oxides, exemplified with Co3O4, simply by constructing highly coupled interface of ultrafine Co3O4 nanocrystals and metallic Ti. Impressively, the amounts of oxygen vacancy on the surface of Co3O4/Ti surpassed the reported values of the Co3O4 modified even under highly critical conditions. The Co3O4/Ti electrode could provide a current density of 23 mAcm(-2) at an OER overpotential of 570 mV, low Tafel slope, and excellent durability in neutral medium. Because of the formation of a large amount of oxygen vacancies as the active centers for OER on the surface, the TOF value of the Co3O4@Ti electrode was optimized to be 3238 h(-1) at an OER overpotential of 570 mV, which is 380 times that of the state-of-the-art non-noble nanocatalysts in the literature.									72	5	0	0	2	0	75			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000406052000004	28612461

This paper reports a facile direct growth method to synthesize NiFe-layered double hydroxides (LDHs) on nickel foil as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction. The NiFe-LDH is synthesized by a galvanic process at room temperature without any additional energy for synthesis. The synthesized NiFe-LDH is a karst landform with abundant active sites and efficient mass diffusion. The NiFe-LDH with an oxygen defect show excellent electrocatalytic performance for the OER, with a low overpotential (272 mV at 10 mA/cm(2)), a small Tafel slope (43 mV/dec), and superior durability. Direct growth synthesis provide excellent electrical conductivity as well as strong bonding between the catalyst layer and the substrate.

Herein, we synthesize a kind of nickel foam (NF)-supported electrocatalyst composed of a one-dimensional Co3O4 nanowire as the core and a two-dimensional NiFe-LDH nanosheet as the shell (denoted as NiFe-60/Co3O4@NF). Fluorine is introduced into the precursor Co(OH)F of Co3O4, which results in improved thermal stability and significantly increased regularly distributed oxygen vacancies, while the electrochemically deposited NiFe-LDH nanosheets possess a crystalline/amorphous hybrid structure. As a result, the hetero-interface mainly constituting Ni species from NiFe-LDH and Co3O4 from Co(OH)F contributes to the interaction between Co and Fe species and facilitates the electron transfer. Simultaneously, the interaction between oxygen vacancies in Co3O4 and coordinatively unsaturated Fe species in the amorphous area in NiFe-LDH is also determined, finally completing the electron backtracking. Benefiting from these factors, only low overpotentials of 221 and 257 mV are required to deliver the current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm(-2), respectively, with a quite small Tafel slope of 34.6 mV dec(-1) during OER for the well-designed NiFe-60/Co3O4@NF electrocatalyst.									23	0	0	0	0	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000753063400006

As a kind of inorganic organic hybrid material, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been used as electrocatalysts in electrocatalytic reactions due to their structural diversities and fascinating functionalities. Particularly, MOF thin films are coordinated on substrate surfaces by a liquid phase epitaxial (LPE) layer by layer (LBL) growth method (called surface-coordinated MOF thin films, SURMOFs), and recently have been studied in various applications due to their precisely controlled thickness, preferred growth orientation and homogeneous surface. In this review, we will summarize the preparation and electrocatalysis of SURMOFs and their derived thin films (SURMOF-D). The SURMOF based thin films possess diverse topological structures and flexible properties, providing abundant catalytically active sites and fast charge transfer for efficient electrocatalytic performance in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CRR), supercapacitors, tandem electrocatalysis and so on. The research challenges and problems of SURMOFs for electrocatalytic applications are also discussed at the end of the review.									25	2	0	0	0	0	25			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000545599900003	32584342

Herein, we develop an effective CeO2 and nitrogen co-decoration strategy to boost the OER performance of NiO (Ce/N-NiO) nanoparticles dramatically. The strong electron coupling among Ce/N-NiO nanoparticles provide exceptional facilities for the interface electron transfer from nitrogen-doped NiO to CeO2, and further induces the formation of rich Ni3+ surface, endowing it with abundant active sites. Besides, the surface electron reconfiguration energetically promotes the adsorption of OH-, resulting in fast reaction kinetics. As expected, the Ce/N-NiO sample shows superior OER property with a low overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Particularly, when the current density exceeds 90 mA cm(-2), the OER activity of Ce/N-NiO outstrips noble-metal-based RuO2. This co-decoration approach provides a practical guide for designing high-performance catalysts for OER and beyond.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000813006000005

However, the most studied MOFs possess microporous nature, which limits the mass-transfer properties and reduce the space to store insoluble discharge product of aprotic metal-air batteries. We herein report a partial ligand removal approach to create mesopore defects and unsaturated coordination in primarily microporous Cu-BTC (BTC = 1,3,5-bezenetricarboxylic acid). The mesopores were engineered by introducing isophthalic acid as a partial ligand, which has one carboxylic group missing compared to BTC, to construct mesoporous Cu-BTC (MCu-BTC). MCu-BTC was further loaded by Co species (Co/MCu-BTC) to boost the bifunctional catalytic performance toward oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. The electrochemical characterizations indicate that the mesopores of MCu-BTC enhanced the discharging capacity (ca. 7000 mAh.g(-1)) of Co-10/MCu-BTC in an aprotic Li-air battery owing to the mesopores, which allowed electrolyte infiltration for both mass and charge transfer and provided more space to store the discharge product. Further modeling simulations shed light on the contribution of the unsaturated coordination by significantly promoting the electronic conductivity and generating adequate interactions with reactants, leading to enhanced mass- and charge-transfer properties.									9	1	0	0	1	0	9			2168-0485			WOS:000636042800021

Low-frequency electrochemical impedance of benzene oxidation on anode of boron-doped diamond								RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMISTRY				49	11			1020	1030		10.1134/S1023193513110050				NOV 2013	2013	Kinetics of low-frequency adsorption of benzene oxidation products are studied in 0.5 M K2SO4 on an anode of boron-doped diamond. A combination of current polarograms and impedance with analysis of the impedance spectroscopy in the frequency range of 0.05-10 Hz allowed studying in detail the mechanism of adsorption oxidation of benzene under the conditions of competition between this process and the more anodic process of oxygen evolution that is also based on adsorption. A frequency-polarization diagram of dependences of characteristic frequencies (CFs) of adsorption and desorption stages on potential was obtained for the product of benzene oxidation and oxygen-containing intermediate of the oxygen evolution reaction. Controlled stages of coupled processes, potentials, and characteristic frequencies of the points of changes in the reaction mechanism are determined: 0.22 Hz at 2.0 V for benzene oxidation; 0.63 Hz at 2.22 V for oxygen evolution. The potential of maximum adsorption of the organic substance is 2.15 V. The obtained results can be useful in the studies of the mechanism of coupled reactions including organic and inorganic intermediate adsorbates.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1023-1935	1608-3342		WOS:000326714600002

Nanosheet-assembled ZnCo2O4 (ZCO) microspheres and thin films grown insitu on single-walled carbon nanotube (ZCO/SWCNT) composites as high-performance air electrode materials for Li-O-2 batteries are reported. The insitu grown ZCO/SWCNT electrodes delivered high discharge capacities, decreased the onset of the oxygen evolution reaction by 0.9V during the charging process, and led to longer cycling stability. These results indicate that insitu grown ZCO/SWCNT composites can be used as highly efficient air electrode materials for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. The enhanced catalytic activity displayed by the uniformly dispersed ZCO catalyst on nanostructured electrodes is expected to inspire further development of other catalyzed electrodes for Li-O-2 batteries and other applications.									28	1	0	0	2	0	28			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000364525800020	26457378

Herein, novel three-dimensional (3D) flower-like Ni2P composed of mesoporous nanoplates with controllable morphology and high surface area was prepared by a hydrothermal method and low-temperature phosphidation as efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Compared with the urchin-like NixPy, the 3D flower-like Ni2P with a diameter of 5m presented an efficient and stable catalytic performance in 0.5m H2SO4, with a small Tafel slope of 79mVdec(-1) and an overpotential of about 240mV at a current density of 10mAcm(-2) with a mass loading density of 0.283mgcm(-2). In addition, the catalyst also exhibited a remarkable performance for the OER in 1.0m KOH electrolyte, with an overpotential of 320mV to reach a current density of 10mAcm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 72mVdec(-1). The excellent catalytic performance of the as-prepared Ni2P may be ascribed to its novel 3D morphology with unique mesoporous structure.									24	3	0	0	1	0	25			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000415372600015	28862374

To minimize this disadvantage, finding an appropriate, competent, and low-cost catalyst has attracted attention worldwide. Layer double hydroxide (LDH)-based materials are promising candidates for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) but not fruitful and their hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity is very poor, due to the lack of ionic conductivity. The inclusion of chalcogenide and generation of inherent oxygen vacancies in the lattice of LDH lead to improvement of both OER and HER activities. The presence of rich oxygen vacancies was confirmed using both the Tauc plot (1.11 eV, vacancy induction) and the photoluminescence study (peak at 426 nm, photoregeneration of oxygen). In this work, we have developed vacancy-enriched, selenized CoFe-LDH by the consequent wet-chemical and hydrothermal routes, respectively, which was used for OER and HER applications in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolytes, respectively. For OER, the catalyst required only 251 mV overpotential to reach a 50 mA/cm(2) current density with a Tafel slope value of 47 mV/dec. For HER, the catalyst demanded only 222 mV overpotential for reaching a 50 mA/cm(2) current density with a Tafel slope value of 126 mV/dec. Hence, generating oxygen vacancies leads to several advantages from enhancing the exposed active sites to high probability in obtaining electrocatalytically active species and subsequent assistance in oxygen and hydrogen molecule cleavage.									42	1	0	0	0	0	42			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000617925100082	33480247

Three-dimensional (3-D) Ni foam (NF) supported pristine few-layer graphene was utilized as an oxygen evolution electrode, showing an overpotential of 382 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 44.9 my dec(-1), both of which are lower than those of pristine NF and graphene and among the lowest reported for carbon and even transition metal-based catalysts measured under the same conditions, and much higher steady-state current density and much less reduction of current density after CV cycling compared to NF and graphene, with negligible current loss after 10 h chronoamperometry and 350 CV cycles. Its high catalytic performance is possibly due to the Ni-promoted OH- adsorption on and uniform dispersion and charge redistribution of the robustly attached graphene. This study not only provides a novel strategy to significantly enhance the OER activity of pristine graphene and creates a high-performance 3-D and binder-free oxygen evolution electrode, but offers scientific insight into the promotion effect of metal supports on the OER activity of pristine graphene.

Over the past several decades, numerous metal oxides with oxygen vacancies have been developed. However, an investigation about oxygen vacancies leading to the formation of nanosheets with different thicknesses has not been available up to now. Here, we report the oxygen vacancy modulated formation of -Ga2O3 nanosheets and demonstrate that the thickness of the nanosheets is not the decisive factor in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction of ultrathin 2D nanosheets. Detailed structural characterization indicated that -Ga2O3 prepared at 160 degrees C (-160) with a morphology of ultrathin nanosheets possesses the highest oxygen vacancy concentration and an optimal thickness of the nanosheets. The enhanced photocatalytic performance could be determined from the synergistic effects between the ultrathin 2D structure and the O-vacancies confined in the ultrathin nanosheets. This work provides an efficient strategy to regulate the formation of nanosheets at the atomic scale and enrich the study on the effect of oxygen vacancies in the photocatalytic water splitting reaction.									18	2	0	0	1	0	18			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000451738900062	30427361

The role of vacancy defects and the effect of their concentration, however, yet remains unclear. Herein, Bi2O3, an unfavorable electrocatalyst for the HER due to a less than ideal hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (Delta G(H)*), is utilized as a perfect model to explore the function of V-o on HER performance. Through a facile plasma irradiation strategy, Bi2O3 nanosheets with different V-o concentrations are fabricated to evaluate the influence of defects on the HER process. Unexpectedly, while the generated oxygen vacancies contribute to the enhanced HER performance, higher V-o concentrations beyond a saturation value result in a significant drop in HER activity. By tunning the V-o concentration in the Bi2O3 nanosheets via adjusting the treatment time, the Bi2O3 catalyst with an optimized oxygen vacancy concentration and detectable charge carrier concentration of 1.52 X 10(24) cm(-3) demonstrates enhanced HER performance with an overpotential of 174.2 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 80 mV dec(-1), and an exchange current density of 316 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline solution, which approaches the top-tier activity among Bi-based HER electrocatalysts. Density-functional theory calculations confirm the preferred adsorption of H* onto Bi2O3 as a function of oxygen chemical potential (Delta mu(o)) and oxygen partial potential (P-O2) and reveal that high V-o concentrations result in excessive stability of adsorbed hydrogen and hence the inferior HER activity. This study reveals the oxygen vacancy concentration-HER catalytic activity relationship and provides insights into activating catalytically inert materials into highly efficient electrocatalysts.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000777141900003	35362783

The film electrodes were prepared by cathodic codeposition from Ni(NO3)(2) solutions containing various Co contents. The Co and Ni can be codeposited homogeneously in hydroxide state. The Co in the film has an evident effect on the OER, which varies with its content, but does not change the mechanism. During LPS, after the Co(OH)(2) being oxidized to CoOOH, it no longer participates in the oxidation and reduction process, but it reduces the Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH reaction potential significantly and the higher the Co content, the more the potential is reduced.

Postspinel-structured oxides, CaB2O4 (B = Cr3+, Mn3+, and Fe3+), have exhibited higher OER activities than nominally isoelectronic conventional counterparts of perovskite oxides LaBO3 and spinel oxides ZnB2O4. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals that the higher OER activities for CaB2O4 series are attributed to the lower charge-transfer resistances. A density-functional-theory calculation proposes a novel mechanism associated with lattice oxygen pairing with adsorbed oxygen, demonstrating the lowest theoretical OER overpotential than other mechanisms examined in this study. This finding proposes a structure-driven design of electrocatalysts associated with a novel OER mechanism.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2046-2069		WOS:000753561500001	35425573

Herein, we report a bubble templating method to synthesize the graphene-like mesoporous carbon sheets with point defects as ORR/HER bifunctional electrocatalysts. The typical product shows excellent ORR performance including the positive onset potential (740 mV) and high diffusion-limiting current density (4.07 mA cm(-2)). Along with small Tafel slopes, the overpotential is determined to be about -453 and -378 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in both alkaline and acidic media, which suggests a good candidate for HER reaction as well. The superior catalytic activities are derived from the abundant point defects on the mesoporous carbon sheets surface, especially the existence of pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen species. This study may be an alternative route to prepare the novel functional materials for the applications of ORR and HER.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			2073-4344			WOS:000467315600085

Such carbon encapsulation, however, imposes significant complications for directly modifying materials' surface atomic/electronic configurations, fundamentally impeding the accurate tuning of their catalytic capabilities. Herein, a universal single-atom alloy (SAA) strategy is reported to indirectly yet precisely manipulate the surface electronic structure of carbon-encapsulated electrocatalysts. By versatilely constructing a SAA core inside an N-doped carbon sheath, material's electrocatalytic capability can be flexibly tuned. The one with Ru-SAA cores serves as an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen/hydrogen evolution, exhibiting minimal cell voltage of 1.55 V (10 mA cm(-2)) and outstanding mass activity of 1251 mA mgRu-1${\rm{g}}_{{\rm{Ru}}}<^>{ - 1}$ for overall water splitting, while the one with Ir-SAA cores possesses superior oxygen reduction activity with a half-wave potential of 919 mV. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the doped atoms can simultaneously optimize the adsorption of protons (H*) and oxygenated intermediates (OH*, O*, and OOH*) to achieve the remarkable thermoneutral hydrogen evolution and enhanced oxygen evolution. This work thus demonstrates a versatile strategy to precisely modify the surface electronic properties of carbon-shielded materials for optimized performances.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000840685500001

The present work establishes Co-P bridging on the surface of Co3O4 via a vapor-assisted treatment in a controlled molar ratio of P/Co (0.08-0.66). The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of P/Co3O4 showed a compositional dependence, reaching the optimal performance with a low overpotential of 314 mV for achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Both experimental characterization and density functional theory calculations indicate that the improved OER performance derives from the establishment of Co-P bridging. The bridging creates more Co2+ ions and oxygen vacancies by driving electrons transfer between P and Co, and thus results in the creation of more active sites, improvement of intrinsic activity, enhancement of electrical conductivity and improvement of electrochemical stability. Furthermore, the present work demonstrates that this generic synthetic approach can also be applied to improve HER and overall water splitting with higher electrochemical activity.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000561593500007

In this communication, we describe the first use of iron phosphide nanosheets array on Ni foam as a high-active and durable catalyst for electrochemical hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) in alkaline media. The high hydrogen-evolving activity of this catalyst electrode and the substitution of sluggish oxygen evolution with thermodynamically more favorable HzOR enables the construction of a stable two-electrode energy-efficient electrolytic hydrogen generation system capable of driving 125mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 0.5V to in 1.0M KOH with 0.5M hydrazine.									28	1	0	0	1	0	28			2365-6549			WOS:000400379900002

The IrOx amorphous layer is generally considered to be substantial enough to break the limitation created by the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) in acidic media. In this work, we used lanthanides to regulate IrOx amorphization-crystallization through inhibiting the crystallization of iridium atoms in the calcination process. The chosen route created abundant crystalline-amorphous (c-a) interfaces, which greatly enhanced the charge transfer kinetics and the stability of the materials. The mass activity of iridium in the synthesized IrO2@LuIr1-nOx(OH)(y) structure reached 128.3 A/g(Ir), which is 14.6-fold that of the benchmark IrO2. All the IrO2@LnIr(1-n)O(x)(OH)(y) (Ln = La-Lu) structures reflected 290-300 mV of overpotential at 10 mA/cm(geo)(2). We demonstrate that a highly active c-a interface possesses an efficient charge transfer capability and is conducive to the stability of the activated oxygen species. The surface-activated oxygen species and the tensile strain [IrO6] octahedron regulated by lanthanides are synergistically beneficial for increasing the intrinsic OER activity. Our research findings introduce c-a interface generation by the regulation of lanthanides as a new method for the rational design of robust OER catalysts.									24	1	0	0	0	0	24			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000558792700048	32658446

The potential of cobalt phosphide (CoP) as efficient OER electrocatalyst has been emerged, but most current developed CoP-based electrocatalysts suffer from high overpotential and poor long-term stability. Herein, a new and controllable surface oxygen functionalization strategy is developed to activate CoP nanowires as high-efficient and stable OER electrocatalyst. The introduction of surface oxygen atoms can not only improve the electron transport and ion diffusion rates, but also can decreases the adsorption Gibbs free energy and prevent further structural damage, endowing the oxygen activated CoP (O-CoP) NWs with superior electrocatalytic activity and stability. The as-obtained O-CoP NW electrode achieves impressively low overpotential potentials of 265, 316 and 338 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), 50 mA cm(-2)and 100 mA cm(-2), which are substantially superior to the recently reported CoP-based electrocatalysts and commercial RuO2. More importantly, this O-CoP NW electrode also possesses remarkable durability even after 55 h long-term test at a large current density of 50 mA cm(-2).									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000561903900001

Herein, we report a facile method to synthesize the SrIrO3 catalyst by solid-state reaction method assisted by mechanical activation. The results demonstrated that mechanical activation is critical to the successful fabrication of the SrIrO3 catalyst. XRD and TEM results confirmed the formation of SrIrO3 without other impurities, and XPS results revealed that some of the Ir species, including Ir4+, existed in +3 valence states. The catalyst shows both high catalytic activity for OER and stability in a sulfuric acid solution, with a Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1) and almost no current decay after 1000 voltammetry cycles. This investigation is of fundamental and practical importance for synthesizing highly efficient SrIrO3 OER electro-catalysts to be potentially applied in copper electrowinning.									4	1	0	0	0	0	3			2053-1591			WOS:000495688000003

Herein, we reported two CoOx-SnOx (Sb doped)/Ti (CSTE-480 and CSTE-600) as high conducive, active, stable and noble metal-free electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction under alkaline condition. The CSTEs electrocatalyst containing conducive Ti-O-Sn(Sb)-O-Co chain were designed and synthesized via a simple layer-by-layer method. XRD, SEM, and FT-IR discovered that the two prepared CSTE electrodes had both amorphous cobalt oxides and octahedral Co3O4 spinel. Under the same conditions, the OER activities and stabilities of CSTEs were superior to commercial Pt and IrO2/Ti respectively. The overpotential and Tafel slope of CSTE-600 for OER at 10 mA.cm(-2) was only 317 mV and 40 mV/dec respectively, indicating that it was a highly active OER catalyst. The compared analysis of SEM, Co valence state, and XRD before and after reaction revealed that CSTE-600 was very stable. Moreover, The OER activity of CSTEs was affected by morphology, the redox of cobalt ion, SnTiO3, and Co2SnO4 on the surface. This strategy can be extended to synthesize other OER electrocatalysts.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000486177700075

The porous framework of C2N provides confined space for trapping metal atoms and inhibiting metal aggregation, while the skeleton provides pairs of pyridinic nitrogens as coordination sites to immobilize metal atoms. The as-prepared catalyst exhibited bifunctional activity toward the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions (ORR and OER). The corresponding rechargeable zinc-air flow battery shows remarkable stability with no degradation even after continuous operation for 6000 cycles (equivalent to 1000 h), placing it as one of the most long-lasting zinc-air batteries.

Now, the development of highly efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts has stimulated increasing interest. Herein, a new composited electrocatalyst of Mo (x) C embedded in N-doped carbon nanosheets (Mo (x) C@NCS) is successfully prepared from a self-assembly route. Due to the expanded interlayers of carbon NCS and enhanced active defective sites induced by two-materials compositing, the as-synthesized Mo (x) C@NCS affords splendid hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, overpotential of 160 mV), as well as remarkable oxygen evolution reaction (OER, overpotential of 360 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline water splitting. In view of earlier excellent performances, the bifunctional Mo (x) C@NCS catalyst shows a low cell voltage of 1.56 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in overall water splitting. In addition, the Mo (x) C@NCS exhibits an outstanding stability after long-term electrochemical measurements.

Herein, we describe a multifunctional electrochemical catalyst obtained through pyrolysis of a bimetallic COF. The catalyst possesses hierarchical pores and abundant iron and cobalt nanoparticles embedded with standing carbon layers. By integrating these features, the catalyst exhibits excellent electrochemical catalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), with a 50mV positive half-wave potential, a higher limited diffusion current density, and a much smaller Tafel slope than a Pt-C catalyst. Moreover, the catalyst displays superior electrochemical performance toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with overpotentials of -0.26V and -0.33V in acidic and alkaline aqueous solution, respectively, at a current density of 10mAcm(-2).

The obtained Fe-TiOx LNWs/Ti lead to a moderate improved stability (81.3% vs. 33.3% for Fe2O3 loaded on Ti foam at the same potential of 1.9 V vs. SCE for 20 h), and remain high activity for OER (a low onset potential of 1.49 V vs. RHE at 1 mA cm(-2)) in acid electrolyte. This study opens up the possibility and universality of active and abundant nonprecious metal oxides for OER utilized in acid electrolytes.									75	5	0	0	5	0	76			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000425396400015

However, the establishment of structure-performance relationships for the design of better Ir-based electrocatalysts is hindered by their uncontrolled surface reconstruction during OER in acidic media. Herein, we monitor the structural evolution of two model Ir nanocrystals (one with a flat surface enclosed by (100) facets and the other with a concave surface containing numerous high-index planes) under acidic OER conditions. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements reveal that the promotion of surface IrOx formation during the OER by the concave Ir surface with high-index planes results in a gradual OER activity increase, while a decrease in activity and limited oxide formation are observed for the flat Ir surface. After the activation process, the Ir concave surface exhibits similar to 10 times higher activity than the flat surface. Density functional theory computations reveal that Ir high-index surfaces are thermodynamically preferred for the adsorption of oxygen atoms and the formation of surface oxides under OER conditions. Thus, our work establishes a structure-performance relationship for Ir nanocrystals under operating conditions, providing new principles for the design of nanoscale OER electrocatalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000712024700001

Fe possesses one less 3d electron and lower electronegativity than Co, suggesting a higher d-band center when forming polyhedron with S anions. Here, to improve the intrinsic activity by elevating the d-band center, the six-coordinated octahedrons in Co9S8 are redesigned utilizing an Fe-incorporated topochemical deintercalation method. Through substituting partial Co octahedrons by Fe octahedrons with higher d-band, the overall d-band center is regulated to achieve optimized adsorption and thus superior OER activity. With a reduction of 95 mV on the overpotential (at 10 mA cm(-2)), this work sheds lights on the design of OER catalysts through polyhedron engineering using topochemical deintercalation.									93	3	0	0	2	0	93			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000599602700001
