This study investigates the impacts of parent coal properties on the evolution of carbon structures of selected Australian coals from the plastic layer to semi-coke stage during coking using electron spin resonance (ESR), Synchrotron attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared microspectmscopy (Synchrotron ATR-FTIR) and solid-state carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13 NMR) analyses. The stable radical concentration, the g-value, and the linewidth measured by ESR were combined with IR and Solid-state C-13 NMR results to improve the understanding of carbon structural transformation at the plastic and post-resolidification stages of coke formation. In addition, micro gas chromatography (micro-GC) was used to study the evolution of gaseous species. The results suggested that the coal undergoes crosslinking reaction, condensation, and re-polymerization within the thermoplastic range, resulting in loss of oxygen to form condensed carbon-bearing crosslinking structures. Due to differences in their chemical structure, macerals significantly influenced crosslinking structures during plastic layer formation. Higher rank coals generated more stable radicals in the plastic phase due to their lower H/C and O/C ratios than low-rank coals with higher vitrinite contents. Lower fluidity and lower rank coals formed oxygen-bearing cross-links at the early plastic stages, hindering fluidity development and carbon ordering at high temperatures. Above the resolidification point, the continuous transformation of C-O and C-H bonds to C-C bonds was accompanied by the release of H-2 and CO2, leading to increased ordering and anisotropy of coke carbon structures.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000747393600001

From efforts toward developing artificial photosynthetic assemblies to the exploration of nanoscale materials to be used as a photoanode for splitting water, a detailed understanding of the mechanistic details of water oxidation in photosystem II (PSII) is paramount for the rational design of an artificial model. In addition, insight into the model's mechanism of molecular-level water-oxidation catalysis will provide us with a unique opportunity to elucidate the mechanistic pathways of water oxidation in the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of PSII.In this review, the proposed mechanisms, catalytic activities and reaction kinetics of catalytic water oxidation with transition metal complexes in homogeneous systems published from 1979 to 2010, with an emphasis on the last decade, are discussed. These metal complexes include mononuclear, dinuclear and multinuclear manganese, ruthenium, iridium, iron and cobalt complexes. Electrodeposited cobalt complexes are a type of heterogeneous water-oxidation catalyst: however, these complexes are discussed herein because they are topological analogs of the Mn cluster in the OEC. M-V=O species (M = Mn, Ru) as the key active species in homogeneous catalytic evolution of O-2 are common feature in many catalysts, in which formation of the O-O bond can be achieved either by intramolecular elimination of dioxygen from two M-V=O groups or by nucleophilic attack of OH- species on M-V=O groups. Another common feature appears from tetranuclear ruthenium complex 71, manganese complex 10 and cobalt complex, all of these cubane structural complexes have self-repair properties similar to OEC-protein complex in nature.

J	Bloess, H; Staikov, G; Schultze, JW								AFM induced formation of SiO2 structures in the electrochemical nanocell								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				47	1-2			335	344		10.1016/S0013-4686(01)00581-3				SEP 1 2001	2001	Nanostructures of SiO2 are formed in the so-called nanocell by AFM tip-induced oxidation of Si. The highly resistive electrolyte is formed by a thin water film in wet gas atmosphere. AFM measurements prove that the water film thickness increases with both p(H2O) and electric field strength. Water consumption by Si oxidation and water electrolysis is compensated by field enhanced water condensation from the gas phase. Due to the absence of a reference electrode, current dependent potential drops at the tip and in the water film cannot be compensated. At constant cell voltage DeltaU, the potential drop within the formed oxide Delta phi (ox) depends not only on DeltaU, but on the polarisation time t and the lateral coordinate x as well. Measurements of current transients in the nanocell and a macroscopic cell show that the oxide growth kinetics are similar, but the quantitative result differs due to the 3D structure of the oxide and the variation of Delta phi (ox)(t,x). Investigation of electron transfer reactions in the macro- and nanocell show that anodic oxygen evolution is possible at high electric fields which is explained by hole tunnelling. Direct tunnelling of electrons from the tip to the Si substrate can only take place in the initial stages of oxide formation through few oxide monolayers. Therefore, faradaic processes can be evaluated in the later stage of experiment. For electrochemical nanosystem technology, the oxidation in a one-step process allows the formation of positive Si-structures, while a multistep process followed by etching of the oxide allows the defined formation of pits.

A rapidly growing number of recent publications have recognized it as a promising candidate with maximum atomic utilization, distinct activity, and selectivity in comparison to bulk catalysts and nanocatalysts. However, the complexity of localized coordination environments and the dispersion of isolated sites lead to significant difficulties when it comes to gaining insight into the intrinsic behavior of electrocatalytic reactions. Furthermore, the low metal loadings of most SACs make conventional ensemble measurements less likely to be accurate on the subnanoscale. Thus, it remains challenging to probe the activity and properties of individual atomic sites by available commercial instruments and analytical methods. In spite of this, continuing efforts have lately focused on the development of advanced measurement methodologies, which are very useful to the fundamental understanding of SACs. There have recently been a number of in situ/operando techniques applied to SACs, such as electron microscopy, spectroscopy, and other analysis methods, which support relevant functions to identify the active sites and reaction intermediates and to investigate the dynamic behavior of localized structures of the catalytic sites.This Account aims to present recent electrochemical probing techniques which can be used to identify single-atomic catalytic sites within solid supports. First, we describe the basic principles of molecular probe methods for the study and analysis of electrocatalytic site behavior. In particular, the in situ probing technique enabled by surface interrogation scanning electrochemical microscopy (SI-SECM) can measure the active site density and kinetic rate with high resolution. An alternative electrochemical probing technique is further demonstrated on the basis of single-entity electrochemistry, which allows the unique electrochemical imaging of the size and catalytic rate of single atoms, molecules, and clusters. The merits and limitations of different electrochemical techniques are then discussed, along with perspectives for future prospects. Apart from this, we further showcase the powerful capability of emerging electrochemical probing techniques for determining significant effects and properties of SACs for various electrocatalytic reactions, including oxygen reduction and evolution, hydrogen evolution, and nitrate reduction. Overall, electrochemical techniques with atomic resolution have greatly increased opportunities for observing, measuring, and understanding the surface and interface chemistry during energy conversion. In the future, it is anticipated that the development of electrochemical probing techniques will be advanced with innovative perspectives on the behavior and features of SACs. We hope that this Account can contribute in several ways to promoting the fundamental knowledge and technical progress of emerging electrochemical measurements for studying SACs.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000768184100001	35148075

Here, we report nitrogen doping-carbon quantum dot (N-CQD) that is prepared from field bindweed using the hydrothermal method. Also, NiCo-layered double hydroxide (LDH) was prepared using a simple method. The prepared samples were characterized using several techniques that confirmed the successful preparation of N-CQD and NiCo-LDH. Also, the effect of molar ratios of Ni: Co on the morphology of NiCo-LDH were studied by the Field Emission-Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM). The obtained images obviously reveal that apply several molar ratios of Ni and Co can affect the morphology and optimized molar ratio Ni: Co was 1: 1. Then, we use N-CQDs combination with the optimized NiCo-LDH for water oxidation. The resulting NiCo-LDH/N-CQD shows improved electro-catalytic activity in comparison with pure NiCo-LDH (with an onset-potential of 1.55 V (vs. RHE) and overpotential about similar to 325 mV in neutral media) for oxygen evolution. The enhanced water oxidation activity is attributed to the association of the NiCo-LDH with N-CQDs. N-CQDs which supply rapid electron transfer, supreme conductivity, and electron reservoir characters that are caused to the rapid electron transfers from N-CQDs to NiCo-LDH on the surface and consequently, could further increase the electro-catalytic reaction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-1317	1872-9053		WOS:000609063400007

However, the photocatalytic performance of Ta3N5 has been far below expectations because insufficient crystallization upon thermal nitridation of the oxide precursors enhances undesirable charge recombination limiting the quantum efficiency of the photocatalytic reaction. This problem was successfully rectified in this study by modifying the surface of the starting Ta2O5 with a small amount of alkaline metal (AM) salts. Compared with conventional Ta3N5, Ta3N5 nitrided from AM salt-modified Ta2O5 had better crystallinity and smaller particles with smoother surfaces and, most importantly, demonstrated a 6-fold improvement in photocatalytic activity for O-2 evolution under visible light. AM salt modification was compatible with the loading of an O-2 evolution cocatalyst, such as CoOx, yielding an apparent quantum efficiency of 5.2% at 500-600 nm. This indicates that the effects of AM modification were attributable to the changes in the crystallinity and the morphology of Ta3N5 rather than to catalytic effects. Detailed characterization of the Na2CO3-modified Ta3N5 suggested partial dissolution of Ta2O5 and nucleation of NaTaO3 in the early stages of nitridation, which gave rise to the characteristic particle morphologies and improved the crystallinity of the nitridation products. This study demonstrates that a facile pretreatment of a starting material can improve the physical and photocatalytic properties of photocatalysts drastically, enabling the development of advanced photocatalysts for solar water splitting.									177	11	0	0	12	0	179			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000312351000011	23181266

MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY				459	4			4428	4439		10.1093/mnras/stw962				JUL 11 2016	2016	iPTF14atg, a subluminous peculiar Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) similar to SN 2002es, is the first SN Ia for which a strong UV flash was observed in the early-time light curves. This has been interpreted as evidence for a single-degenerate (SD) progenitor system, where such a signal is expected from interactions between the SN ejecta and the non-degenerate companion star. Here, we compare synthetic observables of multidimensional state-of-the-art explosion models for different progenitor scenarios to the light curves and spectra of iPTF14atg. From our models, we have difficulties explaining the spectral evolution of iPTF14atg within the SD progenitor channel. In contrast, we find that a violent merger of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs with 0.9 and 0.76 M-aS (TM), respectively, provides an excellent match to the spectral evolution of iPTF14atg from 10 d before to several weeks after maximum light. Our merger model does not naturally explain the initial UV flash of iPTF14atg. We discuss several possibilities like interactions of the SN ejecta with the circumstellar medium and surface radioactivity from an He-ignited merger that may be able to account for the early UV emission in violent merger models.									47	1	0	0	1	0	47			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000379830700077

The state formed gives rise to an S = 1/2 multiline EPR signal [Goussias, Ch., Ioannidis, N., and Petrouleas, V. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 9261] that is attributed to a Mn(II)-Mn(III) dimer [Sarrou, J., Ioannidis, N., Deligiannakis, Y., and Petrouleas, V. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 3581]. In this work, we sought to establish whether the state could be assigned to a specific, reduced S state by using flash oxymetry, chlorophyll a fluorescence, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. With the Joliot-type O-2 electrode, the first maximum of oxygen evolution was observed on the sixth or seventh flash. Three saturating preflashes were required to convert the flash pattern characteristic of NO-reduced samples to that of the untreated control (i.e., O-2 evolution maximum on the third flash). Measurements of the S state-dependent level of chlorophyll fluorescence in NO-treated PSII showed a three-flash downshift compared to untreated controls. In the EPR study, the maximum S-2 multiline EPR signal was observed after the fourth flash. The results from all three methods are consistent with the Mn cluster being in a redox state corresponding to an S-2 state in a majority of centers after treatment with NO. We were unable to generate the Mn(H)-Mn(III) multiline signal using hydrazine as a reductant; it appears that the valence distribution and possibly the structure of the Mn cluster in the S-2 state are dependent on the nature of the reductant that is used.									35	1	0	0	25	0	35			0006-2960			WOS:000174187500019	11863444

Phenol degradation and total organic carbon (TOC) removal followed pseudo-first-order kinetics in the experimental range. A maximum rate was achieved by using a Gd doping ratio of 2 % (molar ratio based on Gd/Sn), which was 56.5 % and 68 % higher than that of the control (Gd/0 %) for phenol degradation and TOC removal. The results from the UV scan of the electrolyte showed that introducing an appropriate amount of Gd could promote the electrochemical incineration process, and thus effectively degrade the chemical intermediates during phenol oxidation. In addition, the Gd/2 %-doped electrode had the longest accelerated life time of 25 h, which was 25 % higher than that of the control. A suitable Gd doping ratio could diminish the SnO2 crystal size and increase the specific surface area, speeding up the electrode's reaction rate, thus promoting the oxygen evolution potential. A regular and compact morphology with a smallest particle size of 9.5 nm was obtained on the Gd/2 %-doped electrode, which prompted a smaller charge-transfer resistance and higher electrical double-layer capacitance than that of the control. The results from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance suggested that a maximal of surface active sites (i. e. oxygen vacancy) was formed on the Gd/2 %-doped electrode, which provided abundant positive charge for adsorbing more oxygen species (37.5 %) than the control (21.5 %), and greatly enhanced the formation of (OH)-O-center dot to attack the targeted pollutant.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2196-0216			WOS:000450042200016

However, a highly active catalyst that can also tune the selectivity toward desired products must be developed for an effective process. Here, we present oxygen functionalized copper (OFn-Cu) nanoparticles as a highly active and methane (CH4) selective catalyst for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. Our electrochemical results indicate that OFn-Cu (5nm) nanoparticles with an oxidized layer at the surface reach a maximum CH4 formation current density and turnover frequency of 36.24 mA/cm(2) and of 0.17 s(-1) at the potential of -1.05 V vs RHE, respectively, exceeding the performance of existing Cu and Cu-based catalysts. Characterization results indicate that the surface of the OFn-Cu nanoparticles consists of an oxygen functionalized layer in the form of Cu2+ (CuO) separated from the underneath elemental Cu by a Cu+ (Cu2O) sublayer. Density functional theory calculations also confirm that presence of the 0 site at the CuO (101) surface is the main reason for the enhanced activity and selectivity. Using this catalyst, we have demonstrated a flow cell with an active area of 25 cm 2 that utilizes solar energy to produce 7.24 L of CH4 after 10 h of continuous process at a cell power density of 30 mW/cm(2).									13	1	0	0	2	0	13			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000518024700077	31971779

Further observations on the evolution of O-2 activation process by nano Fe/Cu bimetals was conducted stretching to the preparation phase (started by nZVI/Cu2+). Interesting breakpoints were observed with obvious sudden increase in the DCF degradation efficiency and decrease in solution pH, as the original nZVI just consumed up to Fe(II) and Cu(II) appeared again. It suggested that the four-electrons reaction of O-2 and Cu-deposited nZVI would occur to generate water prior to the breakpoints, while Cu(0) and Fe(II) would play most important role in activation of O-2 afterwards. Through the electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis and quenching experiments, 'OH was identified as the responsible reactive species. Further time-dependent quantifications in the cases of Cu(0)/Fe(II) systems were carried out. It was found that the 'OH accumulation was positively and linearly correlated with nCu dose, Fe(II) consumption, and Fe(II) dose, respectively. Since either Cu(0) or Fe(II) would be inefficient in activating oxygen to produce (OH)-O-center dot, a stage-evolution mechanism of O-2 activated by nano Fe/Cu bimetals was proposed involving: (a) Rapid consumption of Fe(0) and release of Fe(II) based on the Cu-Fe galvanic corrosion, (b) adsorption and transformation of O-2 to O-2(2) at the nCu surface, and (c) Fe(II)-catalyzed activation of the adsorbed O-2(2) to (OH)-O-center dot.

The plasma-induced decomposition of small concentrations of NO in N-2 used as the carrier gas and O-2 and CH4 as minority components has been studied in a surface wave discharge induced with a surfatron launcher. The reaction products and efficiency have been monitored by mass spectrometry as a function of the composition of the mixture. NO is effectively decomposed into N-2 and O-2 even in the presence of O-2, provided always that enough CH4 is also present in the mixture. Other majority products of the plasma reactions under these conditions are NH3, CO, and H-2. In the absence of O-2, decomposition of NO also occurs, although in that case HCN accompanies the other reaction products as a majority component. The plasma for the different reaction mixtures has been characterized by optical emission spectroscopy. Intermediate excited species of NO*, C-*, CN*, NH*, and CH* have been monitored depending on the gas mixture. The type of species detected and their evolution with the gas composition are in agreement with the reaction products detected in each case. The observations by mass spectrometry and optical emission spectroscopy are in agreement with the kinetic reaction models available in literature for simple plasma reactions in simple reaction mixtures.									22	5	0	0	3	0	25			1089-5639			WOS:000244039600010	17286359

The electrochemical performance of four raw carbon fuels, including a graphitic carbon (GC), two coals (lignite CF and anthracite YQ) and an activated carbon (AC), and their chars is tested to investigate the influence of carbon fuel properties on the cell performance. The results show that CO electro-oxidation and C-CO2 gasification were main anode reactions. The direct carbon electro-oxidation is insignificant under high FAr. Polarization performance of the chars under high FAr was similar with that of 5-10% CO. It is also concluded that the cell performance is greatly dependent on the carbon fuel gasification reactivity with CO2. Thermal pretreated AC displays the best durability performance for its stable and moderate CO2 gasification rate. Additionally, the coal ash does not affect the cell performance significantly.

J	Kasson, Tina M. Dreaden; Barry, Bridgette A.								Reactive oxygen and oxidative stress: N-formyl kynurenine in photosystem II and non-photosynthetic proteins								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				114	2			97	110		10.1007/s11120-012-9784-z				DEC 2012	2012	While light is the essential driving force for photosynthetic carbon fixation, high light intensities are toxic to photosynthetic organisms. Prolonged exposure to high light results in damage to the photosynthetic membrane proteins and suboptimal activity, a phenomenon called photoinhibition. The primary target for inactivation is the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center. PSII catalyzes the light-induced oxidation of water at the oxygen-evolving complex. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated under photoinhibitory conditions and induce oxidative post translational modifications of amino acid side chains. Specific modification of tryptophan residues to N-formylkynurenine (NFK) occurs in the CP43 and D1 core polypeptides of PSII. The NFK modification has also been detected in other proteins, such as mitochondrial respiratory enzymes, and is formed by a non-random, ROS-targeted mechanism. NFK has been shown to accumulate in PSII during conditions of high light stress in vitro. This review provides a summary of what is known about the generation and function of NFK in PSII and other proteins. Currently, the role of ROS in photoinhibition is under debate. Furthermore, the triggers for the degradation and accelerated turnover of PSII subunits, which occur under high light, are not yet identified. Owing to its unique optical and Raman signal, NFK provides a new marker to use in the identification of ROS generation sites in PSII and other proteins. Also, the speculative hypothesis that NFK, and other oxidative modifications of tryptophan, play a role in the PSII damage and repair cycle is discussed. NFK may have a similar function during oxidative stress in other biologic systems.									15	0	0	0	12	0	16			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000312132100002	23161228

The nanocomposites were synthesized via the in situ growth of oppositely charged 2D LDHs in the presence of negatively charged ZnS QDs. The partial intercalating of ZnS QDs in the interlayer space of the LDHs is evidenced by powder X-ray diffraction results. In comparison with ZnS QDs and pristine LDHs, the prepared CoZnAl-LDH/ZnS and MnZnAl-LDH/ZnS heterostructures show surprisingly enhanced visible light harvesting ability with an expansion of the ligand to metal charge transfer absorption edge to visible wavelengths. The obtained results imply effective electronic coupling between ZnS QDs and LDHs. The charge carrier recombination is largely suppressed, as indicated by the photoluminescence and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results. From the Tauc and Mott-Schottky plots, the band structures of the synthesized heterostructures were determined. The resulting heterostructures reveal promising activity for visible light photocatalytic oxygen evolution via water splitting and the degradation of Acid Red 14, as a model organic pollutant, and significantly enhanced photostability, much superior to pristine LDHs and ZnS QDs.									38	1	0	0	8	0	37			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472225200059		
J	Sung, Chia-Chi; Liu, Chao-Yang								A novel micro protective layer applied on a simplified PEM water electrolyser								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				38	24			10063	10067		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.06.034				AUG 12 2013	2013	This study presents a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) technique, using a proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyser, to produce high purity hydrogen and oxygen (both 99.99%). A proposed structural design provides comprehensive sealing of the assembly while combining a current collector and a flow field plate into a single component. The titanium porous disc with a highly condensed structure compared to the carbon based gas diffusion layer plays a key role as the support for the proton exchange membrane when producing high-pressure hydrogen. The electrochemical stability is enhanced as well owing to the consolidated component. The titanium porous disc is coated with noble metal catalysts (IrO2/Ta2O5 composition) as a micro protective layer (MPL) to prevent corrosion and oxidation during hydrogen production from water electrolysis. The proposed MPL can effectively transform active oxygen species (such as oxygen atoms and hydroxyl free radicals) into harmless oxygen gas during water electrolysis. In this study, it is found that the electrolytic cell can sustain up to 10 bar and its lifetime is capable of lasting over 600 h continuously while maintaining a voltage of 2.33 to 2.35 V and current density of 1 A cm(-2).

Numerous explorations on metallic oxides and their composites were aimed at promoting visible light efficiency by narrowing bandgap and enhancing charge separations. In this work, we designed and synthesized the zinc oxide/ graphitic carbon nitride (ZnO/g-C3N4) composites with diverse content of surface oxygen vacancies. We investigated the possible correlations between the surface defects and energy band structure using ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra, Mott-Schottky plots and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results show that the surface oxygen vacancies in ZnO/g-C3N4 were responsible for the narrowing of the bandgap derived from the lower conduction band of ZnO. Composites of ZnO/g-C3N4 with more surface oxygen vacancies had significantly increased transient photocurrent with higher photocatalytic activity under visible light. The improved photocatalytic activity was demonstrated through photocatalytic organic degradation kinetics. Moreover, the introduction of surface oxygen vacancies in composite was originated from the formation of Zn-C bonds at heterojunctions between ZnO and g-C3N4.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000663741300001

To gain insight into how plants respond to low-oxygen stress, gene expression profiling using whole-genome DNA amplicon microarrays was carried out at seven time points over 24 h, in wild-type and transgenic P-SAG12:ipt Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Transcript levels of genes involved in glycolysis and fermentation pathways, ethylene synthesis and perception, calcium signaling, nitrogen utilization, trehalose metabolism, and alkaloid synthesis were significantly altered in response to oxygen limitation. Analysis based on gene ontology assignments suggested a significant down-regulation of genes whose functions are associated with cell walls, nucleosome structures, water channels, and ion transporters and a significant up-regulation of genes involved in transcriptional regulation, protein kinase activity, and auxin responses under conditions of oxygen shortage. Promoter analysis on a cluster of up-regulated genes revealed a significant overrepresentation of the AtMYB2-binding motif (GT motif), a sugar response element-like motif, and a G-box-related sequence, and also identified several putative anaerobic response elements. Finally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions using 29 selected genes independently verified the microarray results. This study represents one of the most comprehensive analyses conducted to date investigating hypoxia-responsive transcriptional networks in plants.									233	10	0	0	219	6	248			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000227957200033	15734912	
J	Borodin, V. B.								Specifics of the Clark-Type O-2-Electrodes Application in Biological Studies								RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				68	4			774	782		10.1134/S1021443721030031				JUL 2021	2021	This paper is focused on the specifics of amperometric oxygen (O-2) measurements in biological media (cultivation media, reaction mixtures, media designed for isolated cellular and subcellular structures) and other complex media using Clark-type electrodes. Specifically, the impact of the qualitative and quantitative composition of liquid media on the readings of Clark electrodes is considered. Using sucrose, sorbitol, NaCl and phosphate buffer as examples, it has been shown that, provided the content of dissolved O-2 is constant, an increase in the content of concomitant to O-2 substances in the test medium results in an increase of the signal of the Clark electrode located in this medium. On the basis of the obtained and published data, the effect of the qualitative and quantitative composition of media on the readings of Clark electrodes is evaluated. In its turn, the very effect of media composition on Clark electrodes readings can be explained by the fact that in reality Clark electrodes measure the activity of dissolved O-2, which usually increases with an increase in the content of concomitant to O-2 substances. Since Clark electrodes measure the activity rather than the true O-2 content in media and the ratio between the activity and true O-2 content is often unknown, the issue regarding the calibration of Clark electrodes has been also considered in this study. It is noted that the methods of adding known amount of O-2 to liquid media (the Hill reaction, catalase reaction, or injection of a micro portion of water saturated with pure O-2), which were applied in this work to demonstrate the effect of media composition on the Clark electrode readings, can be used to calibrate the Clark electrodes in units of the true O-2 content, and, thus, to take into account the influence of the media content on the readings of these O-2-sensors when it is necessary. It is suggested that the calibration based on the addition of an O-2-saturated micro-portion of water or, if necessary, O-2-saturated micro-portion of another suitable liquid to the medium with the Clark electrode is, due to its almost unlimited applicability and other advantages, the most satisfactory way of calibration. The introduction of this calibration method into scientific practice can make quantitative O-2-measurements with Clark electrodes more accurate in many difficult cases.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1021-4437	1608-3407		WOS:000671641300020		
J	Marcus, P; Protopopoff, E								Potential-pH diagrams for sulfur and oxygen adsorbed on chromium in water								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				144	5			1586	1590		10.1149/1.1837645				MAY 1997	1997	The concept of equilibrium potential-pH diagrams (E-pH) for two-dimensional species adsorbed on metals is applied to the case of sulfur and oxygen adsorbed on chromium in water. Standard Gibbs energies of formation for sulfur and oxygen adsorbed on chromium are calculated from literature thermodynamic data for chemisorption from the gas phase. The E-pH relations associated with the equilibria between water, the dissolved sulfur species, and adsorbed sulfur and oxygen are given at 25 and 300 degrees C. The corresponding E-pH diagrams are calculated for a sulfur activity of 10(-4) and are superimposed on the usual Pourbaix diagrams for the S-Cr-H2O system. Formation of adsorbed sulfur monolayers on the metal surface is predicted in E-pH domains where the usual diagrams do not predict the stability of a chromium sulfide. Predictions of the corrosion risk for chromium in sulfur-containing aqueous environments can be done using the reported E-pH diagrams.									39	2	0	0	0	0	40			0013-4651			WOS:A1997XD00600024

The development of superior electrocatalysts based on earth-abundant materials, plays a critical role in the future. CoSe2 nanorods as an efficient electrocatalyst for the hydrogen, one of the earth-abundant electrocatalysts, has been proved to be a promising catalyst for hydrogen generation. In our work, flower-like CoSe2 nanorods as an efficient electrocatalyst for the hydrogen nanorods with high quality are successfully synthesized through a facile ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ligand (EDTA)-assisted hydrothermal process. The flower-like CoSe2 nanorods as an efficient electrocatalyst for the hydrogen nanorods show the brilliant electrochemical HER performance with 100 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of 273 mV, a small Tafel slope of 35 mV dec(-1) and strong durability in acid solution. The sparkly HER catalytic activity of CoSe2 nanorods as an efficient electrocatalyst for the hydrogen can be ascribed to its particular structure with large surface area and abundant active sites. Therefore, this work offers an outstanding candidate for improving hydrogen production capabilities by water electrolysis.

In this work, we report that the support of N-doped carbon containing atomic copper sites, amongst supports of carbon or N-doped carbon, show the optimal modulation on nanoparticles of platinum, achieving highly electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with overpotential of merely 20 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), superior to that of commercial Pt/C. And the mass activity reaches 40.1 A mg(-1)Pt at 50 mV, much outperforming Pt/C and control sample without Cu. Experimental and theoretical investigations suggest that the existence of atomic Cu-N-x sites contributes subtle changes to the interaction way between Pt and the support, resulting in Pt nanoparticles with finely tuned electronic properties and moderate affinity to the intermediate, corresponding to the summit of volcano curve, that efficiently facilitating the HER process.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000788216000003

Poly[N-9-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4,7-di-2-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT) is one of a relatively large class of push-pull carbazole-based copolymers that have been synthesized to better harvest the solar spectrum. The 2,7-carbazole building block of PCDTBT is also used with different electron-accepting units in a large variety of low-band-gap polymers. The photochemical and morphological behavior of PCDTBT thin films is investigated from the molecular scale to the nanomechanical properties. The photo-oxidation mechanism is shown to be governed by chain-scission and cross-linking reactions. It results in dramatic evolution of the morphology, roughness and stiffness of thin PCDTBT films. Based on the identification of several photoproducts formed along the macromolecular chains or released into the gas phase, the main pathways of PCDTBT photochemical evolution are discussed. These processes first involve the scission of the CN bond between the carbazole group and the tertiary carbon atom bearing the alkyl side-chain. Modifications of the chemical structure of PCDTBT, the evolution of its UV-visible absorbance, and its nanomechanical properties initiated by light irradiation are shown to be closely related.									67	1	0	0	3	0	68			1614-6832			WOS:000317430700012

In photosystem II, the photoproduced electrons leave a special pair of chlorophylls (namely, P-D1 and P-D2) that becomes cationic. This oxidizing pair [P-D1,P-D2](+), in turn, triggers a cascade of oxidative events, eventually leading to water splitting and oxygen evolution. In the present work, using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations, we investigate the electronic structure and the dynamics of the PD1PD2 special pair in both its oxidized and reduced states. In agreement with previously reported static calculations, symmetry between the two chlorophylls was found to be broken, the positive charge being preferentially located on P-D1. Nevertheless, this study reveals for the first time that large charge fluctuations occur along dynamics, temporarily inverting the charge preference for the two branches. Finally, a vibrational analysis pinpointed that such charge fluctuations are strongly coupled to specific modes of the special pair.									18	0	0	0	9	0	18			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000368323100041	26587662

The discovery of the apicoplast in apicomplexan parasites has drawn attention to this problem and, more specifically, to the question of whether many other nonphotosynthetic lineages also contain cryptic plastids or are derived from plastid-containing ancestors. Oxyrrhis marina is one such organism: It is a heterotrophic, early-branching member of the dinoflagellate lineage for which there is no evidence of a plastid. To investigate the possibility that O.marina is derived from a photosynthetic ancestor, we have generated and analyzed a large-scale EST database and searched for evidence of plastid-derived genes. Here, we describe 8 genes whose phylogeny shows them to be derived from plastid-targeted homologues. These genes encode proteins from several pathways known to be localized in the plastids of other algae, including synthesis of tetrapyrroles, isoprenoids, and amino acids, as well as carbon metabolism and oxygen detoxification. The 5' end of 5 cDNAs were also characterized using cap-dependent or spliced leader-mediated reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, revealing that at least 4 of these genes have retained leaders that are similar in nature to the plastid-targeting signals of other secondary plastids, suggesting that these proteins may be targeted to a cryptic organelle. At least 2 genes do not encode such leaders, and their products may presently function in the cytosol. Altogether, the presence of plastid-derived genes in O. marina shows that its ancestors contained a plastid, and the pathways represented by the genes and presence of targeting signals on at least some of the genes further suggests that a relict organelle may still exist to fulfill plastid metabolic functions.									69	0	0	0	62	0	70			0737-4038	1537-1719		WOS:000256979100006	18385218

Herein, we design and fabricate N, P-co-doped molybdenum carbide/porous carbon hybrid rough microspheres by a simple hydrothermal and followed annealing method using red jujube and phosphomolybdic acid as carbon and Mo source, respectively. Benefiting from carbon framework derived from red jujube inhibiting the aggregation of Mo2C nano particles, N, P co-doping changing the electro-structure of the adjacent Mo and C atoms, and rough micro-spherical structure increasing the electrolyte-active materials contact surface, the resulting material exhibits high electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 103 and 80 mV at current densities of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 57 and 46 mV dec(-1), respectively, in acidic and alkaline electrolyte, and excellent stability. The convenient resource, facile preparation and high performance make this material showing great potential in cost effective hydrogen production. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In this work, an (NH4)(2)S2O8 (APS) induced thermal exfoliation approach is introduced to fabricate O-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets (OCNs). During this calcination process, the thermal decomposition products (NH3 and H2SO4) from APS not only efficiently promote delamination, but also introduce O doping into the g-C3N4 structure, realizing the synchronization control of the electronic structure and morphology. Compared to the bulk g-C3N4, OCNs show exceptional enhancement of the photocatalytic degradation of RhB and H-2 evolution, owing to their enlarged specific surface area, more active edges exposed, and efficient photogenerated carrier separation. This work provides a useful pathway to design and prepare potentially advanced g-C3N4.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2052-1553			WOS:000759752200001

Spectroscopic, microscopic and analytical methods evidenced a structural reformation of cubic CoO to active CoOx with a spinel structure. The superior water oxidation activity of CoOx has been established in electrochemical water oxidation under alkaline conditions. Electrochemical water oxidation with CoOx was recorded at a considerably low overpotential of merely 325 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in comparison to 370 mV for CoO. Transformation of both octahedral CoII and CoIII sites into amorphous Co(OH)(2)-CoOOH is the key to high electrochemical activity while the presence of a higher amount of octahedral CoIII sites in CoOx is imperative for an efficient oxygen evolution process.									66	0	0	0	2	0	66			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000396146900049

Moret, Yannick/I-9282-2012				Limiting immunopathology: Interaction between carotenoids and enzymatic antioxidant defences								DEVELOPMENTAL AND COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY				49	2			278	281		10.1016/j.dci.2014.12.007				APR 2015	2015	The release of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) during the inflammatory response generates damages to host tissues, referred to as immunopathology, and is an important factor in ecological immunology. The integrated antioxidant system, comprising endogenous antioxidant enzymes (e.g. superoxide dismutase SOD, and catalase CAT) and dietary antioxidants (e.g. carotenoids), helps to cope with immune-mediated oxidative stress. Crustaceans store large amounts of dietary carotenoids for yet unclear reasons. While being immunostimulants and antioxidants, the interaction of these pigments with antioxidant enzymes remains unclear. Here, we tested the interaction between dietary supplementation with carotenoids and immune challenge on immune defences and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes SOD and CAT, in the amphipod crustacean Gammarus pulex. Dietary supplementation increased the concentrations of circulating carotenoids and haemocytes in the haemolymph, while the immune response induced the consumption of circulating carotenoids and a drop of haemocyte density. Interestingly, supplemented gammarids exhibited down-regulated SOD activity but high CAT activity compared to control ones. Our study reveals specific interactions of dietary carotenoids with endogenous antioxidant enzymes, and further underlines the potential importance of carotenoids in the evolution of immunity and/or of antioxidant mechanisms in crustaceans.

Herein, the novel V-doped Ni3S2/NiS heterostructure nanorod arrays grown on nickel foam (VNS/NF-WM) are synthesized via a facile methanol-assisted hydrothermal method. We demonstrate that the morphology, phase composition, and crystallinity of VNS/NF are well modulated by tuning the ratios of water/methanol solvent. The optimized VNS/NF-WM-heterostructured nanorod (volume ratio of water/methanol is 3:1) exhibits superior HER electrocatalytic activity with low overpotentials of 85 and 218 mV to yield current density values of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, meanwhile sustaining an excellent stability with almost an unchanged current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for 60 h. Our work offers fresh insights into the rational design of highly active and stable earth-abundant-heterostructured electrocatalysts for the hydrogen fuel production.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0743-7463			WOS:000610993500037	33372797

The D1 cleavage was greatly facilitated by the addition of 0.15 mM ZnCl2 and 1 mM ATP and was completely inhibited by 1 mM EDTA, indicating the participation of an ATP-dependent metalloprotease(s) in the D1 cleavage. Herbicides 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1- dimethyl urea, bromoxynil, and ioxynil, all of which bind to the Q(B) site, inhibited the D1 cleavage, suggesting that the DE-loop of the D1 protein is the heat-sensitive cleavage site. We solubilized the protease by treating the thylakoids with 2 M KSCN and detected a protease activity in the supernatant by gelatin activity gel electrophoresis in the 70 - 80-kDa region. The antibodies against tobacco FtsH and Arabidopsis FtsH2 reacted with a 70 - 80-kDa band of the KSCN-solubilized fraction, which suggests the presence of FtsH in the fraction. In accordance with this finding, we identified the homolog to Arabidopsis FtsH8 in the 70 - 80-kDa region by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass analysis of the thylakoids. The KSCN-solubilized fraction was successively reconstituted with thylakoids to show heat-induced cleavage of the D1 protein and production of the D1 fragment. These results strongly suggest that an FtsH protease( s) is involved in the primary cleavage of the D1 protein under moderate heat stress.									105	13	1	0	96	0	117			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000239387100011	16735503	
J	Saucedo, Marco A.; Dennis, John S.; Scott, Stuart A.					Scott, Stuart/0000-0002-4597-9094			Modelling rates of gasification of a char particle in chemical looping combustion								PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE				35				2785	2792		10.1016/j.proci.2014.07.005				2015	2015	Rates of gasification of lignite char were compared when gasification with CO2 was undertaken in a fluidised bed of either (i) an active Fe-based oxygen carrier used for chemical looping or (ii) inert sand. The kinetics of the gasification were found to be significantly faster in the presence of the oxygen carrier, especially at temperatures above 1123 K. An analytical solution assuming pseudo-binary diffusion of species was developed to account for external and internal mass transfer and for the effect of the looping agent. The model also included the effects of the evolution of the pore structure at different conversions. The results are compared with a full numerical model using the Stefan-Maxwell equations. Excellent agreement was observed between the rates predicted by the two models and those observed experimentally at T <= 1123 K. At 1173 K, the pseudo-binary model predicted slightly higher rates than the full numerical solution. It was found that a significant share of the error of the predicted rates with the analytical solution was caused by an underestimation of intraparticle diffusional resistance rather than by assuming a pseudobinary system external to the particle. Both models suggested that the presence of Fe2O3 led to an increase in the rate of gasification because of the rapid oxidation of CO by the oxygen carrier to CO2. This resulted in the removal of CO and maintained a higher mole fraction of CO2 in the mixture of gas around the particle of char, i.e. within the mass transfer boundary layer surrounding the particle. This effect was most prominent at similar to 20% conversion when (i) the surface area for reaction was a maximum and (ii) because of the accompanying increase in porosity, intraparticle resistance to gas mass transfer within the particle of char had fallen, compared with that in the initial particle.

Herein, we build up a novel visiblelight-driven S-scheme in CdS/ZnTHPP binary nanosystem by simple sintering process ensuring the fast transfer of the photo-generated carriers, showing dark green upon simulated sunlight irradiation. Under an optimal condition, the highest hydrogen evolution turnover number (TON) reaches around 22,264 during 128 h irradiation, and the H2 evolution rates of the best CdS/ZnTHPP binary nanosystem was boosted up to a 400 mmol/g under irradiation for 8 hours with a conversion rate over 10-fold-higher than that of pristine CdS NRs. The macrocyclic compound serves as a region of electron absorption assisting the fast and continuous consumption of photo-generated electrons in this system, thereby concurrently alleviating the recombination of electron-hole pairs. Theoretical analyses reveal that the active sites and the generation of H2 are controlled by the thermodynamic process. This new finding provides a new approach to rationally designing an efficient solar-to-chemical conversion system.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, most of the studies through this methodology are confined to the use of precious metals or non-precious materials with poor performance, especially in alkaline electrolytes. Herein, we report a novel strategy of fabricating nickel nanograins coated onto a Co, N-doped carbon framework (Co-NCF@Ni) based on the manipulation of ALD and in situ transformation of a cobalt zeolitic imidazolate framework for efficient hydrogen evolution in alkaline media. The catalytic performance of the Co-NCF@Ni with different Ni contents is specifically studied. On the basis of this composite, a flexible high-performance H-2 production device, distinguished from the conventional powdery pattern, is realized, and stable performance under a repeated rolling process is demonstrated. In order to disclose the mechanism of the remarkable HER performance, density functional theory calculations are carried out and the results indicate that the electron structures of inner Co atoms, external Ni atoms, and the N-doped carbon layer can be tuned due to the introduction of Ni nanoparticles. The research presented here may have great potential in developing both high efficiency transition-metal based electrocatalysts and flexible H-2-production devices for use under extreme conditions.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521938400057

We report the preparation of hierarchical mesoporous-Pt nanoparticles (HM-PtNPs) with coral-like rough surface morphologies using environmental friendly and biocompatible fucoidan (Fu) biopolymer as a surface engineering compound and its application to electrocatalysts for water-splitting. The designed HM-PtNPs yields better mass activity of electrocatalysts compared to a commercial Pt/C. HM-PtNPs showed an overpotential of 33 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER in 0.5 M H2SO4, which was highly comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C catalysts (29 mV). However, the amount of HM-PtNPs loaded in glassy carbon electrode (0.033 mg mL(-1) ) was approximately 20 times lower than that of the commercial Pt/C (0.64 mgmL(-1). The HM-PtNPs also maintained high catalytic stability with a consistent HER current density after 1000 continuous operation. The excellent HER performance is attributed to the improved electrochemical surface area, highly porous structure, and good surface wettability of the HM-PtNPs, which results in enhanced electrocatalytic activity, decreased resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface, and facile penetration of the electrolytes inside the electrode.

In this work, unique ternary Cd0.85Zn0.15S@WO3/WS2 (CZ(0.15)S@WO3/WS2) core-shell nanorods consisting of amorphous WO3 and few-layered WS2 nanosheets were synthesized through a two-step solvothermal method for the first time. The composition of WO3/WS2 shell is found to vary with the change of W content, which has a significant impact on the photocatalytic property of CZ(0.15)S@WO3/WS2 toward H-2 evolution reaction (HER). Under visible-light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm), the optimized CZ(0.15)S@WO3/WS2 composite (n (WO3): n (WS2) = 3:1) demonstrates a superior HER activity of 76.33 mmol h(-1) g(-1) (corresponding to an AQY of 23.9% at 420 nm), which can be further remarkably increased to 157.29 mmol h(-1) g(-1) when the reaction is driven by full Xe-lamp spectrum. The HER capability of CZ(0.15)S@WO3/WS2 is much better than that of Pt-decorated CZ(0.15)S and most CdS-based photocatalysts ever reported, due to the notably enhanced charge transfer and separation via the synergistic cooperation of Z-scheme and type-I charge transfer processes. The findings displayed here could inspire new strategies to optimize the charge separation of multi-component photocatalysts for highly-effective solar conversion and utilization.

Here, a heterogeneous Ni-MoN catalyst consisting of Ni and MoN nanoparticles on amorphous MoN nanorods that can sustain large-current-density HER with outstanding performance is demonstrated. The hierarchical nanorod-nanoparticle structure, along with a large surface area and multidimensional boundaries/defects endows the catalyst with abundant active sites. The hydrophilic surface helps to achieve accelerated gas-release capabilities and is effective in preventing catalyst degradation during water electrolysis. Theoretical calculations further prove that the combination of Ni and MoN effectively modulates the electron redistribution at their interface and promotes the sluggish water-dissociation kinetics at the Mo sites. Consequently, this Ni-MoN catalyst requires low overpotentials of 61 and 136 mV to drive current densities of 100 and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively, in 1 m KOH and remains stable during operation for 200 h at a constant current density of 100 or 500 mA cm(-2). This good HER catalyst also works well in alkaline seawater electrolyte and shows outstanding performance toward overall seawater electrolysis with ultralow cell voltages.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000786412300001	35363922

Incorporation of molecular catalysts into extended frameworks has emerged as a viable strategy for improving catalytic performance and durability while maintaining a high degree of control over the structure and properties of the catalytic active site. Here, we investigate benzenehexathiolate (BHT) coordination frameworks as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in pH 1.3 aqueous solutions. The electro-catalytic HER activity of BHT-based coordination frameworks follows the order of CoBHT > NiBHT > FeBHT. CoBHT operates at an overpotential of 185 mV, the lowest observed overpotential of the reported metal dithiolene-based metal organic frameworks and coordination polymers to date. To further understand the properties that dictate electrocatalytic activity, the effect of film thickness on the HER performance of CoBHT, a parameter that has not been extensively explored for electrocatalytic coordination frameworks, was examined. As the thickness was increased to similar to 1 mu m, charge and proton transfer through CoBHT was hindered, the number of electrochemically accessible active sites decreased, and the mechanical robustness of the modified electrode was diminished. The observed thickness dependent HER activity of CoBHT highlights the importance of practical electrode construction and offers insight into how to optimize proton and electron transfer properties and active site densities within coordination frameworks without reducing the mechanical robustness of the immobilized catalysts.									72	3	0	0	3	0	71			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000423140400029	29251487

The as-synthesized 0.8%Pt-Naf-CV catalyst exhibits an enhanced electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, which obtains a low overpotential of 34 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve of 0.8%Pt-Naf-CV catalyst is almost consistent with that of commercial Pt/C. However, the 0.8%Pt-Naf-CV catalyst displays a more excellent stability and durability in comparison with commercial Pt/C. Besides, the Pt loading of Pt/C (Pt-10 wt%) is about 10 times that of 0.8%Pt-Naf-CV catalyst. The improved electrocatalytic performances are derived from the synergistic effects of Pt and Nafion. The Nafion plays a significant role as a dispersant, carrier and structure directing agent on the morphology and size of the Pt catalyst. This result contributes a promising method to enhance the catalytic activity and reduce the amount of Pt. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

USE - For producing synthesis gas and hydrogen starting from liquid hydrocarbon feedstock, possibly also mixed with gaseous hydrocarbon streams (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The process provides a method for producing synthesis gas and hydrogen having investment costs and energy consumptions lower than those of the processes of the prior art which has a wider flexibility both with respect to the productive capacity and to the possibility of being fed with various kinds of liquid and possibly gaseous, hydrocarbon feedstock even containing relevant amounts of sulfurated and nitrogenous compounds. The method allows production of synthesis gas and therefore of hydrogen, utilizing liquid or possibly gaseous hydrocarbon streams. The method offers the possibility of varying the productivity of H2 to follow the requirements of refining operations. The process can not only be used in refining environments in a strict sense but in oil up-grading environments. The method controls the temperature peaks inside the reactors (Tmax 1200 degrees C against the approximately 2000 degrees C of non-catalytic PO processes); catalytically controls the selectivity of the reactions towards partial oxidation products (CO and H2); reduces the formation of by-products (carbonaceous residues and unsaturated precursors of carbonaceous residues), inevitable in substoichiometric processes in homogeneous gaseous phase; obtains outlet temperatures of synthesis gas lower than 1200 degrees C; and is capable of varying both the composition and flow of hydrocarbon feedstock, in addition to the flows of the oxidizing stream and vapor. The process allows synthesis gas and H2 to be produced by alternating the use of natural gas and other gaseous hydrocarbons with various refinery feedstock, whose exploitation is currently not economically convenient or is extremely complex from a technical point of view (for example LCO, HCO and DAO). The process can be used for producing synthesis gas and H2 starting from intermediate hydrocarbon feedstock resulting from processing of the EST process, which cannot normally be used in traditional SR, non-catalytic PO and ATR processes. The method allows productivity of H2 to be varied for satisfying the requirements of refinery operations, as it is able to use the various refinery feedstock streams available, which undergo a sequential evolution. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Producing synthesis gas and hydrogen starting from liquid hydrocarbon feedstock, possibly also mixed with gaseous hydrocarbon streams, involves nebulizing/vaporizing a stream of a liquid hydrocarbon feedstock consisting of at least one of the following hydrocarbons: naphthas, various kinds of gas oils such as Light Cycle Oils (LCO), Heavy Cycle Oils (HCO) and Vacuum Gas Oils (VGO), other products of refining cycles and oil upgrading such as Deasphalted Oils (DAOs), other heavy residues, at a temperature of 50-500 degrees C and a pressure of 2 to 50 atmosphere, where the nebulization also is effected with the help of a gaseous propellant (preferably with the addition of CO2) selected from vapor and/or a gaseous hydrocarbon and resulting in the formation of a nebulized/vaporized liquid hydrocarbon stream; mixing the nebulized/vaporized liquid hydrocarbon stream coming from the above phase with: an oxidizing stream, possibly mixed with vapor, possibly a gaseous hydrocarbon stream, at a temperature of 50-500 degrees C and a pressure of 2 to 50 atmosphere, with the formation of a possibly biphasic liquid-gas reaction mixture; passing the reaction mixture coming from the above phase through at least a first structured catalytic bed with the formation of a mixture of reaction products comprising H2 and CO, where the structured catalytic bed comprises a catalytic partial oxidation catalyst, arranged on at least one layer, where the reaction mixture flows through each of the layers with a contact time of 0.01 to 100 ms (preferably 0.1-10 ms); and cooling the mixture of reaction products. The oxidizing stream is selected from a stream of oxygen, air and oxygen enriched air. The structured catalytic bed also comprises a support selected from metallic gauze, metallic foam, metallic honeycomb monolith and/or monolith obtained by assembling corrugated metallic sheets, at least one type of transition metal selected from Rh, Ru, Ir, Pt, Pd, Au, Ni, Fe and/or Co. The gaseous hydrocarbon stream is a stream of a gaseous hydrocarbon, possibly with the addition of CO2, selected from methane, natural gas (NG), refinery gas or purge gas of oil up-grading processes and/or liquefied petroleum gas (preferably selected from natural gas, refinery gas, and/or purge gas of oil up-grading processes). The gaseous propellant is a gaseous hydrocarbon, possibly with the addition of CO2, selected from natural gas, refinery gas and/or purge gas of oil up-grading processes liquefied petroleum gas (preferably natural gas, refinery gas or purge gas of oil up-grading processes). An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for an equipment for effecting the process comprising at least the following sections: an inlet section into which liquid and gaseous reagent streams are fed, where the section comprises a device for nebulizing/vaporizing the liquid streams, where the device possibly is capable of utilizing vapor and/or a gaseous hydrocarbon stream as propellant; a mixing section comprising a chamber having a cylindrical or truncated-conical geometry, for mixing the reagent streams at the exit from inlet section and forming a possibly biphasic homogeneous reaction mixture; a reaction section comprising at least one structured catalytic bed containing a catalytic partial oxidation catalyst arranged on at least one layer and heating units of the structured catalytic beds, in which the reaction mixture at the exit from mixing section flows through each layer of the structured catalytic bed with a contact time of 0.01 to 100 ms (possibly 0.1 to 10 ms), producing a mixture of reaction products; and a cooling section for cooling of the mixture of reaction products leaving reaction section.

We attribute the increase in J(sc) to the structural evolution of pc-Si:H films toward denser and larger crystallites with reduced oxygen contamination. As a result, we have obtained efficiencies of 8.2% and 7.9% for solar cells grown at 21 Angstrom/s and 30 Angstrom/s, respectively.					3rd World Conference on Photovoltaic Energy Conversion3rd World Conference on Photovoltaic Energy Conversion	MAY 11-18, 2003MAY 11-18, 2003	WCPEC-3 Org Comm; Inst Elect, Informat & Commun Engineers; Japan Soc Aeronaut & Space Sci; Chem Soc Japan; Japan Sect Int Solar Energy Soc; Electrochem Soc Japan; Japan Solar Energy SocWCPEC-3 Org Comm; Inst Elect, Informat & Commun Engineers; Japan Soc Aeronaut & Space Sci; Chem Soc Japan; Japan Sect Int Solar Energy Soc; Electrochem Soc Japan; Japan Solar Energy Soc	Osaka, JAPANOsaka, JAPAN	10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2159-2330	2159-2349	*************	WOS:000222658800394

In this paper, we present a detailed study on fluid inclusions and stable isotopes of the Xiajinbao gold deposit, Hebei Province, China, aiming at discussing the ore source, evolution of ore-forming fluid and ore-forming mechanism of the deposit. The macroscopic geological characteristics, S and Pb isotopic analysis results show that the source of ore-forming materials is mainly from granitic magma, and subordinately from country rocks. H and O isotopic composition features indicate that the ore-forming fluid is mainly derived from magmatic water. Fluid inclusion characteristics show that the ore-forming fluid experienced boiling during the early mineralization stage, which led to the precipitation of gold. Fluid mixing dominated the precipitation of the ore-forming materials during the middle and late stages. The gold precipitation was caused by water/rock reaction throughout the whole ore-forming process.									4	2	0	0	0	0	6			1003-6326	2210-3384		WOS:000406388300016

The first step in this process is formation of the Fe(III)(HS-)TPP complex followed by an electrontransfer from HS- to Fe(III) and formation of Fe(II)TPP and HS center dot. The electron transfer process depends on the half-wave potential (E-1/2) of the complex. The E-1/2 of Fe(III)/(II)TPP was measured electrochemically and it was found to decrease from 0.061 to-0.14V vs. SHE (standard hydrogen electrode) with increasing solution pH from 4 to 9. The oxidation of Fe(II)TPP by O-2 is shown to follow a four-step reaction mechanism, and the reaction kinetic parameters were calculated using experimental data. The second-order rate constant of the reaction between Fe(III)TPP and HS- at pH 9 was found- within 95% confidence limit- to be about 30.5 21.0 M(-1)s(-1). This study provided valuable information about the oxidation characteristics of Fe(II)TPP by O-2 and the capability of Fe(III)TPP as a catalyst for the air/O-2 oxidation of HS-.

Without making any assumptions about specific dissolution mechanisms, the model is a vigorous stochastic exploration of all of the elementary reactions and basic processes involved in dissolution: bond breakage, bond formation, surface diffusion, and departure and arrival of Si- and Al- units. In the stochastic model, the interdependence of these elementary reactions and basic processes is strictly determined by the complicated three-dimensional surface structure in which interconnected Si- and Al- atoms share oxygen atoms. The modeling results are consistent with experimental data in various aspects, such as saturation state dependence of the dissolution rate, aluminum inhibition effects, surface chemistry evolution, anisotropic dissolution, and alteration product. The stochastic model integrates all microscopic information at the atomic scale and elucidates the reasons for the observed kinetic results in experimental studies, improving our fundamental understanding of aluminosilicate dissolution.									35	0	0	0	2	0	35			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000252968000022	18211053

However, Pt alloy formation with rare-earth (RE) elements through the traditional chemical route is still a challenge due to the vastly different standard reduction potentials. Here, we report a universal chemical method to prepare a series of Pt/RE (RE = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Lu) nanoalloys with tunable compositions and ultrasmall particle sizes (sub-2 nm). These Pt-RE nanoalloys were synthesized by a strong liquid metal reduction with high-speed shearing assistance at room temperature. Among the nine Pt-RE alloy catalysts, the PtNd/C shows the best hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity, stability, and durability compared to commercial Pt/C. The PtNd/C shows an overpotential of 25.9 mV at the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) with a Tafel slope of 19.5 mV/dec and excellent stability in the acidic medium. This work not only provides a general and scalable strategy for synthesizing noble metal-RE alloys but also highlights noble metal-RE alloys as sufficiently advanced catalysts and accelerates the research of noble metal-RE alloy in energy related applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000844302200001	35976031

In this context, herein we have synthesized two different types of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs, denoted as BMM-11 and BMM-12) constructed from the same metal salts (cobalt nitrate) and organic linkers (H4BPTC) at the similar solvothermal conditions. Interestingly, we learned that both crystalline materials can be conveniently converted into each other by a single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation method at their corresponding synthetic conditions. Meanwhile, we applied them directly as electrocatalysts into OER application where the pure BMM-11 and BMM-12 can achieve a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with an overpotential of 0.362 and 0.393 V, respectively, during which MOF degradation unexpectedly occurs. After electrolysis, the following microscopic, spectroscopic, as well as electrochemical measurements confirm that these initial MOF precursors are rapidly transformed into the mixed phases of CoOxHy, species consisting of CoOOH and Co(OH)(2), which are essentially active components for OER performance. Finally, we have also considered other strategies to improve MOF-derived composites in oxygen evolution activity, including bimetallic doping and physical grinding strategy. The approach described here can further be extended to other cobalt-based MOFs-derived electrocatalysts for water splitting.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000518088800013	32052630

The variations in double-layer capacitance, film resistance, and charge-transfer resistance during electrolysis were recorded at different potentials. A comprehensive deactivation mechanism of titanium anodes has been proposed by the growth of an insulating TiO2 layer at the coating-substrate interface due to the titanium substrate oxidation. The impedance interpretation of the deactivation mechanism in chloride solutions changes with an increase in potential due to an increase in oxygen evolution on the anode surface at higher potentials.									44	1	0	0	4	0	45			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000275586800063

FeS2 is the main component of pyrite, which is suspected to be a major contributor to coal spontaneous combustion (CSC). So, it has important significance to FeS2 on the characteristics of coal oxidation for prevention and treatment. This study used coal samples mixed with different proportions of FeS2 (2.0 mass%, 4.0 mass%, and 6.0 mass% mass percentage) were tested to investigate the characteristics of spontaneous combustion, as compared with the fresh sample. The CO and CO2 production rates, critical temperature, and dry cracking temperature during oxidation were analyzed. The temperatureprogrammed experiments was conducted to simulate low-temperature oxidation processes realistically. In-situ infrared spectroscopy was used to appraise the evolution of low-temperature (< 200.0 degrees C) oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, and oxygen-containing functional groups on the surfaces of the samples. Experimental results showed that FeS2 exhibited a strong influence as the temperature exceeded the dry cracking temperature. Adding 2.0 mass% and 4.0 mass% FeS2 showed a promoting effect on low-temperature oxidation; however, FeS2 became an inhibitor which reached 6.0 mass%. Furthermore, adding 2.0 mass% FeS2 showed the strongest promoting effect. From a microscale perspective, the promoting effect of FeS2 on coal oxidation was due to thermal release from FeS2 oxidation, enhancing the reaction between aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as methyl groups and methylene, and oxygen. Due to the reaction of FeS2, the acidic environment was conducive to the hydrolyzation of lipid structures into highly active alcohol or phenol structures, which in turn promoted the oxidation of the coal sample. These results are crucial for understanding the mechanism underlying the influence of FeS2 on CSC and mine safety protocols. (C) 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Herein, CeO2/Co3O4 nanowire arrays grown on Ni foam were fabricated as a free standing cathode of LOBs, featuring a controllable discharge/charge products evolution route. CeO2 served as active sites for nucleation, initial growth and decomposition of Li-2O2 . The embedded CeO2 nanocrystalline on Co3O4 substrate dominated the initial discharge/charge product evolution with multi-formation kinetics of crystal Li2O2 and Li2-xO2 at high current densities which leading to low overpotentials and efficient decomposition of discharge products. Owing to the stable structure, the CeO2 /Co3O4 nanowires were found to energetically favor the mass transport between the electrode/electrolyte interface during long cycle testing. As a consequence, excellent cyclability of 500 cycles at high current density (500 mA g(-1)) under a fixed capacity of 500 mA h g(-1) with low overpotentials of 0.2 V and 1.0 V for discharge/charge process (after 500 cycles) were achieved. The present work provides a new strategy and intrinsic insight in designing high-performance metal oxides electrocatalysts with a fine-tuned structure for LOBs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The nitrogen partial pressure was kept constant during every deposition whereas that of the water vapour was systematically changed from 0 to 0.1 Pa. The evolution of the deposition rate with an increasing amount of water vapour injected into the process was correlated with the target poisoning phenomenon estimated from the target potential. Structure and morphology of the films were analysed by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Films were poorly crystallised or amorphous with a typical columnar microstructure. Nitrogen, oxygen and titanium concentrations were determined by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy and nuclear reaction analysis, and the amount of hydrogen in the films was also quantified. Optical transmittance in the visible region and electrical conductivity measured against temperature were gradually modified from metallic to semiconducting behaviour with an increasing supply of the water vapour partial pressure. Moreover, an interesting maximum of the electrical conductivity was observed in this transition, for a small amount of water vapour. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

First, the substrate generation/tip collection mode was employed to extract the "true" cathodic current associated with the HER from the total current in the polarization curve. Compared to metallic Ni, the electrocatalytic activity of the HER is improved in the presence of the low-valence-state oxide of Ni. This result is in agreement with a previous claim that the dissociative adsorption of water can be-enhanced at the Ni/Ni oxide interface. Second, the surface interrogation scanning electrochemical microscopy (SI-SECM) mode was used to directly measure the coverage of the adsorbed hydrogen on Ni at given potentials. Simulation indicates that the hydrogen coverage follows a Frumkin isotherm with respect to the applied potential. On the basis of the combined analysis of the Tafel slope and surface hydrogen coverage, the rate determining step is suggested to be the adsorption of hydrogen (Volmer step) in the investigated potential window.									74	4	0	0	5	0	76			0002-7863			WOS:000398764000039	28276238

However, Pt atoms in the core of Pt NPs cannot be utilized for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the agglomeration of Pt NPs also reduces the enhancement effect. In this paper, we propose a simple and kinetically modulated post-synthetic strategy to encapsulate low-coordinated and monodispersed Pt clusters (PCs) with a mean size of 1.6 nm into the inner space of NH2-UiO-66 (U6N). The X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) data indicate that the PCs with low coordination numbers and short Pt-Pt bonds possess more unoccupied d orbitals, which enhance the interactions between PCs and the MOF. Consequently, such enhanced interactions result in the acceleration of electron-hole separation that is beneficial to the HER activity of U6N, as confirmed by ultrafast transient absorption spectra. This MOF with encapsulated PCs shows a H(2)production efficiency of 36.83 mmol h(-1)g(-1)and turnover number of 598 h(-1)under visible light with photosensitizer erythrosin B and sacrificial agent triethanolamine. The results suggest that such PCs can efficiently boost the photocatalytic HER of U6N, and our strategy may provide a new avenue for fabricating MOFs with excellent catalytic properties.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000556422000011

The C/O ratio in the SNe Ia progenitors (C-O white dwarfs) may be related to this variation. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of stellar mass (M) and metallicity (Z) on the C/O ratio and its distribution in the C-O white dwarfs by calculating stellar evolution from the main sequence through the end of the second dredge-up for M = 3-9 M. and Z = 0.001-0.03. We find that the total carbon mass fraction just before SN Ia explosion varies in the range 0.36-0.5. We also calculate the metallicity dependence of the main-sequence mass range of the SN Ia progenitor white dwarfs. Our results show that the maximum main-sequence mass to form C-O white dwarfs decreases significantly toward lower metallicity, and the number of SN Ia progenitors may be underestimated if metallicity effect is neglected. We discuss the implications of these results on the variation of SNe Ia, determination of cosmological parameters, luminosity function of white dwarfs, and galactic chemical evolution.									142	8	0	0	1	0	144			0004-637X			WOS:000079816000030

A number of concentric layers (zones) have been observed in a meridian section of the sample after shock-wave loading. The pressures in the converging shock wave and in the diverging shock wave reflected from the center of the sample have been estimated as a function of the radial position of Lagrangian particles on the basis of the calculation of pressure profiles P(R, t). The data on the phase composition of different zones are considered in respect to the pressures induced by the converging and diverging shock waves at their boundaries. It has been established that pressures below similar to 45 GPa cause only additional compacting of the material and deformation of aluminum and quartz. In this case, the quartz grain size substantially decreases up to the transition into the X-ray amorphous state. The attainment of a pressure of similar to 45 GPa initiates the solid-state reaction of SiO(2) decomposition, which leads to the precipitation of pure silicon and the evolution of oxygen. The beginning of the silicon precipitation and the chemical reaction of Al(2)O(3) formation are separated over the pressure scale. The critical pressure, which is necessary for the solid-state chemical reaction of the Al(2)O(3) formation is about 50 GPa.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0031-918X			WOS:000248392000011

The electrode exhibited a compact structure, with the IrO2-RuO2 binary oxide coatings appearing as finely dispersed crystals. The IrO2-RuO2 composite electrodes were used as the anode to degrade sulfamethazine (SMT) via the indirect oxidation process of hydroxyl radicals. The optimum degradation conditions of SMT were as follows: initial concentration: 50 mg/L; current density: 40 mA/cm(2) and initial pH: 6.0 at a supporting electrolyte (Na2SO4)concentration of 0.2 mol/L. The IrO2-RuO2 composite electrodes effectively removes chemical oxygen demand (COD) from actual wastewater: the removal rate was 49.17%. The after-treatment COD value was 107.83 mg/L lower than China's urban sewage COD discharge standard (120 mg/L). These results indicate that the electrocatalytic degradation of SMT with electrodes is feasible. Besides, the effects of the experimental conditions on the sensitivity of the experiment were studied by using an established mathematical model and an artificial neural network (ANN) model representing the first time, which can be used to effectively predict and guide the removal of COD from SMT-containing wastewater using IrO2-RuO2 composite electrodes. The modeling results show that reaction time was the most significant factor affecting SMT removal efficiency, whereas pH value was the most important factor affecting COD removal efficiency.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000670387500006

In both control and NaCl-washed particles which were depleted of the extrinsic 23 and 16 kDa polypeptide, the 18:3 treatment caused a 20% release of the 33 and 43 kDa polypeptides. In CaCl2 (or urea + NaCl)-washed particles, which were depleted of the 33 kDa polypeptide in addition to the 23 and 16 kDa polypeptides, the release of the 43 kDa polypeptide increased to 70%, whereas only 25% of the 47 kDa polypeptide was removed. These findings suggest (i) that the 33 and the 43 kDa polypeptides are neighbours in the photosynthetic membrane and (ii) that the 33 kDa polypeptide shields the 43 kDa polypeptide against the action of 18:3. Incubation of CaCl2 or (urea + NaCl)-treated PS II particles in the presence or absence of 18:3 resulted in the loss of only 2 of the 4 Mn atoms present per reaction center. this indicates that the 2 Mn atoms more firmly associated with PS II are not affected by the removal of the extrinsic 16, 23 and 33 kDa polypeptides, and the intrinsic 43 kDa polypeptide, nor by the treatment with linolenic acid.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0031-9317			WOS:A1991FW45300021

To date, selecting suitable conditions to reach desired porosity, composition and catalytic activity is based on trial-and-error-attempts, due to insufficient understanding of the electrochemically induced morphological and compositional changes of the nanoparticles. These changes are elucidated here by combining electrochemistry with identical location electron microscopy analyses and linking them to the electrocatalytic properties of the obtained nanocatalysts. Using AgAu alloy nanoparticles and the hydrogen evolution reaction as a model system, the influence of cyclic voltammetry parameters on the catalytic activity upon electrochemical dealloying is investigated. Increasing the number of cycles initially results in a decreased Ag content and a sharp improvement in activity. Additional dealloying increases the nanoparticle porosity, while marginally altering their composition, due to surface motion of atoms. Since this is accompanied by particle aggregation, a decrease in catalytic activity results upon extensive cycling. This transition between porosity formation and particle aggregation marks the optimum for nanocatalyst post-production. The gained insights may aid speeding up the development of new materials by electrochemical dealloying as an easy-to-control post-processing route to tune the properties of existing nanoparticles, instead of having to alter usually delicate synthesis routes as a whole.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000573889000020

We fabricated such nanostructure by the absorption of initiator and functional monomers, including acrylamide and phytic acid on graphene oxides, followed by UV-initiated polymerization, then by adsorption of cobalt ions and finally calcination to form N,P-doped graphene structures. Our experimental results show significantly enhanced performance for such engineered nanostructures due to the synergistic effect from nanoparticles encapsulation and nitrogen and phosphorus doping on graphene structures. The obtained Co2P@NPG modified cathode exhibits small overpotentials of only -45 mV at 1 mA cm(-2), respectively, with a low Tafel slope of 58 mV dec(-1) and high exchange current density of 0.21 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4. In addition, encapsulation by N,P-doped graphene effectively prevent nanoparticle from corrosion, exhibiting nearly unfading catalytic performance after 30 h testing. This versatile method also opens a door for unprecedented design and fabrication of novel low-cost metal phosphide electrocatalysts encapsulated by graphene.									258	12	0	0	9	0	261			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000379794200104	27267432

According to the selection rules of overtone and combination bands, most of them are attributed to the second-order Raman spectra of beta -carotene. Compared with the SERS of normal Pd OECC, the SERS of Pd OECC after strong illumination shows a decrease in scattering intensity and an increase in line widths, indicating changes of conformation and micro-environment of beta -carotene. The results of SERS are consistent with the changes of absorption spectrum of Pd OECC induced by strong illumination. There are no changes that can be ascribed to new vibration bands, so it is deduced that Pd OECC on the silver mirror is identical to that in the solution. In summary, SERS proved a good method to study the photodamage mechanism of photosynthesis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0577-7496			WOS:000166156800005

The influence of the electrocatalyst-anode material, applied current and time of treatment on both the surface chemistry and porous texture properties of the GAC has been analyzed. For comparison purposes, the same GAC has been treated with three of the classical chemical oxidants: HNO3, H2O2 and (NH4)(2)S2O8 at different concentrations and for different times. Results show that the anodic treatment in NaCl causes a remarkable oxidation of the AC without modifying significantly its textural properties. TPD profiles and the linear dependence of the amount of CO- and CO2-evolution against the oxidation level denotes that surface oxygen groups of similar nature and composition are formed anodically, regardless of the anode material. The achieved oxidation degree depends on the different ability of each anode for the electrochemical generation of highly oxidizing chlorine species, and it increases progressively with the applied current and the time of treatment. In general, for similar treatment times, the anodic treatment in NaCl can produce oxidation degrees much higher than the chemical treatment with (NH4)(2)S2O8, which has been found to be the most oxidative chemical studied in this work.

Various inorganic salts, such as NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, and AlCl3, could be used as the porogens. The porosities of the products could be tuned by the ratios of precursors, annealing temperatures, and kinds of salts. When KCl was adopted, the sample of K-GTCo0.6-900 showed a high BET surface area (773 m(2)g(-1)). Furthermore, the electmcatalytic results exhibited that the high surface area could enhance electmcatalytic activity for HER under alkaline condition.

Herein, binary zinc cobalt layered double hydroxide (ZnCo-LDH) films were directly grown on a conductive metal foil by a facile electrodeposition method. The as-deposited ZnCo-LDH films were composed of highly oriented nanowalls with the ab plane vertical to the substrate. The interconnected two-dimensional (2D) LDH nanosheets acted as basic units for the nanowall architectures, which exhibited excellent catalytic activity for electrochemical water oxidation in alkali solution. The onset overpotential of the optimal LDH catalyst for oxygen-evolving reactions is similar to 0.33 V in an alkali solution, superior or comparable to those of well-known Co-based electrocatalysts (e.g. Co3O4). The turnover frequencies (TOFs) of ZnCo-LDH catalysts show a linear dependence on the overpotentiats, higher than that of monometallic cobalt hydroxide at the overpotential beyond 0.55 V. For instance, at the overpotentiat of 0.7 V. the TOF value (3.56 s(-1)) of the optimal LDH is 1.7 times higher than that of monometallic cobalt hydroxide and is 4 times higher than that of LDH powder prepared by a co-precipitation method. The high catalytic activity is attributed to the highly sufficient exposure of accessible active sites on the vertically grown 2D nanosheets. Therefore, this study provides an effective way for preparing high-performance electrocatalysts based on LDH nanosheets, which are beneficial to practical engineering applications owing to their robust binding and integrated construction on metal substrates with any desirable shape.									263	19	0	0	15	0	269			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000340514500009

Electrochemical investigations including cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed to examine the electrocatalytic potential of the synthesized nanomaterials. Performed electrochemical (EC) studies designated Ag2O/gamma-Al2O3 as a robust electrocatalyst for WEOR. Standard benchmarking protocols were employed to appraise the activity of synthesized catalysts. All catalyst materials exhibited comparable activities by achieving an overpotential of nearly 300 mV at 10 mAcm(-2). Results demonstrated that an increase in Ag2O contents reduced the charge transfer resistance (R-ct) and augmented EC surface area, ensuing in reduced onset potential (0.98 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and a small Tafel slope (TS) of 0.85 V dec(-1). EC analysis revealed high WEOR performance at all Ag2O/gamma-Al2O3 modified electrodes, however maximum diffusion coefficient (D-o; 6.5 x 10(-6) cm(2)s(-1)), mass transport coefficient (mt; 7.63 x 10(-4) cm s(-1)), rate constant (k(o); 2.4 x 10(-4) cm s(-1)) and low R-ct (101 Omega) was observed for 5% Ag2O/gamma-Al2O3. This study scheme has proved to be cost-effective synthesis of Ag2O/gamma-Al2O3 catalysts providing better fallouts for activity and stability for water oxidation at ambient conditions.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000767881100015

The structure and morphology of original and oxidized CNTs have been characterized using Raman, FTIR, XPS, TG, N-2 cryonic adsorption and TEM techniques. The thermal behaviour of various CNTs-containing suspensions in decalin has been measured under microwave irradiation, and correlated with their electrical conductivity. The results show that the oxidation treatments not only introduce the oxygenated groups but also partially damage or even break the graphene layer structure of CNTs. The electrical conductivity of CNTs decreases consequently rendering the thermal behaviour of the oxidized CNTs inferior. The catalytic performance of Pt catalysts supported on the original and the oxidized CNTs has been evaluated in the reaction of hydrogen releasing from decalin under microwave irradiation and compared with that presented using conventional heating. The Pt catalysts supported on the oxidized CNTs performs worse than the Pt/CNT-Original catalyst in terms of average reaction rate and selectivity by taking whatever heating methods. The depressed catalytic activity can be ascribed to the limitation of hydrogen diffusion due to the entrapment of a majority of Pt particles inside the hollow tubes of the oxidized CNTs. The strong coupling effect of CNT suspensions with microwave can induce higher reaction temperatures, which can explain the superior catalytic performance under microwave irradiation than using conventional heating.

By varying the concentration of tris buffer at pH 8.0 during an incubation period it is shown that the destruction of oxygen evolution activity is accompanied by a corresponding emergence of an ability to photooxidize diphenylcarbazide, as evidenced by absorbance changes due to diphenylcarbazide at 300 nm. The temperature-sensitive oxidation of diphenylcarbazide is inhibited by DCMU and by high ionic strengths.

Oxygen functional groups form in the fibers prestabilized in air, providing active sites for dehydrogenation and intermolecular crosslinked reactions, which facilitates the formation of turbostratic graphite structure in partially carbonized fibers. The fibers prestabilized in nitrogen and their corresponding partially carbonized fibers are brittle feature, and have comparatively low tensile strength and elongation. The fibers prestabilized in air did not change the color of concentrated sulfuric acid until being etched in it for 6 h; by contrast, the fibers prestabilized in nitrogen were dissolved out only within 1 min. It indicates that the former has better chemical stability than the latter. The present work provides direct evidence that oxygen containing structure in prestabilized fibers is an essential precondition for obtaining high property carbon fibers.

However, the most reports focused on the noble metals such as Au, Ag and Pt and the high cost restricts the practical application. In this work, the ZnO films hybridized with Cu nano particles (NPs) are fabricated by a two-step dc magnetron sputtering method and used as the photoanodes in water oxidation. Various characterizations including XRD, AFM, XPS, TEM, UV-Vis and PL spectra have been conducted, respectively. Moreover, the PEC performance of the samples is also investigated. Compared with the bare ZnO photoanode, the Cu/ZnO photoanode shows higher photocurrent densities under illumination. The enhancement can be mainly ascribed to the improved visible absorption and electrons conductivity based on the surface plasmon resonance effect of Cu NPs. Therefore, it offers a brand new facile method for improving the performance of PEC reactions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The obtained catalytic results were correlated with the catalyst structure, which was characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, EDX, H-2-TPR and BET. The catalytic results indicated that the CuFe mixed oxide samples exhibited superior performance compared to its analogous single nano-oxide catalysts. The influence of the reaction condition variables, such as the solvent, reaction temperature, time, and amount of H2O2 oxidant, were investigated. Under optimized conditions, CuFe resulted in benzene conversion of 44% at a phenol selectivity of 91% and a corresponding combined hydroquinone/catechol/benzoquinone selectivity of 9%. In addition, the catalytic activity of the nano-oxide CuFe was significantly affected by the different calcination temperatures due to the induced catalyst structure, which was confirmed by the characterization results. This enhanced activity was due to the structural phases and redox modification resulting from the interface between the Cu and Fe metals, which was caused by varying calcination temperatures. The activity of CuFe does not require the formation of the typical favored CuFe2O4 spinel to achieve a highly active catalyst, which results from the enhanced redox potentials. CuFe is highly recyclable due to its magnetic nature, which results in an excellent ecofriendly catalyst for the direct synthesis of phenol from benzene hydroxylation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To investigate the relationship between PBS and PSII and to optimize the energy transfer efficiency from PBS to PSII, isolation of the PBS-PSII supercomplex is necessary. SPC (sucrose/phosphate/citrate) is a conventional buffer for isolating PBS-PSII supercomplex in cyanobacteria. However, the energy transfer occurring in the supercomplex is poor. Here, we developed a new buffer named SGB by adding 1M glycinebetaine and additional sucrose to SPC buffer. Compared to SPC, the newly developed SGB buffer greatly enhanced the associated populations of PBS with thylakoid membranes and PSII and further improved the energy transfer efficiency from PBS to PSII reaction centers in cyanobacteria in vitro. Therefore, we conclude that SGB is an excellent buffer for isolating the PBS-PSII supercomplex and for enhancing the energy transfer efficiency from PBS to PSII reaction centers in cyanobacteria in vitro.									1	1	0	0	1	0	1			0300-3604	1573-9058		WOS:000318282600005

Spatially resolved reactants are induced to react by laser heating of their interface. The spatially intermediate products are observed through X-ray absorption contrast. Limits to the technique include the ability to maintain controlled experiment geometry during compression and the ability to resolve chemical differences between reactants and products by X-ray absorption. The ability to make in situ observations at experimental pressure and temperature obviates the problem with quenching techniques for capturing liquid compositions in experiments with dimensions smaller than the diffusion length during quenching time. Partially molten Fe-alloy systems, of poor quenchability, are examined at DAC pressures and temperatures for relevance to Earth's core constitution and evolution. Determinations of eutectic melting in Fe-FeS match known results. Of the probable light elements that may alloy with Fe in the Earth's liquid outer core, Fe-FeS experiments show only modest quenching problems, but C and Si alloy experiments are highly vulnerable to quenching artifacts. The observed reactivity of FeS, Fe3C, FeSi, and FeO(OH) with Fe in DAC makes the observed non-reactivity between Fe and FeO more significant, reducing the probability that oxygen alone is the major alloy in Earth's molten outer core.

Herein, we report a straightforward method to manufacture a metal-free, hierarchically porous and N/S co-doped CNT-graphene 3D framework via one-step pyrolysis of the guanine-sulfate and OCNTs. The usage of guanine-sulfate as carbon precursor can yield very regular (2D nanosheet) and in situ nitrogen-doped carbons. By combining with OCNTs, the as-obtained graphene is found to strongly couple with the surface of CNTs, achieving the uniform distribution of both components. Such 3D hybrid shows high activity toward a set of important electrochemical reactions and high-performance in Zn-air batteries. Systematic electrochemical studies indicate the indispensability of both the optimal nitrogen configuration and well-developed porosity for excellent ORR/OER/HER performance. The amount of pyridinic-N and graphitic-N, rather than the total nitrogen content, has a more positive effect on ORR activity, particularly for the onset potential; while the favorable pore size distributions might guarantee a much well-developed diffusion-limited current region and considerable diffusion-limited current value. These results undoubtedly could provide meaningful guidance to develop highly efficient electrocatalysts.									64	3	0	0	2	0	65			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000457512700047

However, these materials may not be directly useful for applications requiring properties other than their natal ones. In recent years, strain has been shown to be an additionally useful handle to tune the physical and chemical properties of materials by changing their geometric and electronic structures. The strategies for producing strain are summarized. Then, the electronic structure of quasi-two dimensional layered non-metallic materials (e.g., graphene, MX2, BP, Ge nanosheets) under strain are discussed. Later, the strain effects on catalytic properties of metal-catalyst loaded with strain are focused on. Both experimental and computational perspectives for dealing with strained systems are covered. Finally, an outlook on engineering surface properties utilizing strain is provided.									44	4	0	0	5	0	45			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000383375900001	27376498

ACS CATALYSIS				8	3			2093	2110		10.1021/acscatal.7b03723				MAR 2018	2018	Catalyst preparation with plasmas is increasingly attracting interest. A plasma is a partially ionized gas, consisting of electrons, ions, molecules, radicals, photons, and excited species, which are all active species for catalyst preparation and treatment. Under the influence of plasma, nucleation and crystal growth in catalyst preparation can be very different from those in the conventional thermal approach. Some thermodynamically unfavorable reactions can easily take place with plasmas. Compounds such as sulfides, nitrides, and phosphides that are produced under harsh conditions can be synthesized by plasma under mild conditions. Plasmas can produce catalysts with smaller particle sizes and controllable structure. Plasma is also a facile tool for reduction, oxidation, doping, etching, coating, alloy formation, surface treatment, and surface cleaning in a simple and direct way. A rapid and convenient plasma template removal has thus been established for zeolite synthesis. It can operate at room temperature and allows the catalyst preparation on temperature-sensitive supporting materials. Plasma is typically effective for the production of various catalysts on metallic substrates. In addition, plasma-prepared transition-metal catalysts show enhanced low-temperature activity with improved stability. This provides a useful model catalyst for further improvement of industrial catalysts. In this review, we aim to summarize the recent advances in catalyst preparation with plasmas. The present understanding of plasma-based catalyst preparation is discussed. The challenges and future development are addressed.									229	19	0	0	8	0	233			2155-5435			WOS:000426804100055

Rational design and synthesis of highly efficient catalysts has become the ultimate goal of catalysis research. Thanks to the rapid development of nanoscience and nanotechnology, and in particular a theoretical understanding of the tuning of electronic structure in nanoscale systems, this element of design is becoming possible via precise control of nanoparticles' composition, morphology, structure and electronic states. At the same time, it is important to develop tools for in situ characterization of nanocatalysts under realistic reaction conditions, and for monitoring the dynamics of catalysis with high spatial, temporal and energy resolution. In this review, we discuss confinement effects in nanocatalysis, a concept that our group has put forward and developed over several years. Taking the confined catalytic systems of carbon nanotubes, metal-confined nano-oxides and 2D layered nanocatalysts as examples, we summarize and analyze the fundamental concepts, the research methods and some of the key scientific issues involved in nanocatalysis. Moreover, we present a perspective on the challenges and opportunities in future research on nanocatalysis from the aspects of: (1) controlled synthesis of nanocatalysts and rational design of catalytically active centers; (2) in situ characterization of nanocatalysts and dynamics of catalytic processes; (3) computational chemistry with a complexity approximating that of experiments; and (4) scale-up and commercialization of nanocatalysts.									192	21	0	0	18	1	196			2095-5138	2053-714X		WOS:000356861100014

We found that a suitable content of oxygen in an iron nano-catalyst particle can reduce the internal thermal mobility of Fe atoms in catalyst due to the formation of strong Fe-eO bonds. These strong FeeO bonds also cause reduction of the iron nano-catalyst particle diameter and hence accelerate the collisions of carbon atoms on the catalyst particles. Contrarily, the high electronegativity of oxygen will induce positive charges on the Fe surface and consequently slow down the thermal mobility of adsorbed carbon atoms, causing a reduction of the nucleation rate. By tuning these two opposing factors with the oxygen contents of the iron nanoparticles, potentially highly efficient syntheses of SWCNT including diameter control can be carried out. The current results indicated that in our simulations the optimum ratio of iron and oxygen was 6:1. The observed reduced iron mobility may have implications for Ostwald ripening and for the control of the catalyst shape. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The main objective was to understand how to limit or favor the magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)(2)) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) deposits that progressively passivate the cathode surface during the electrolysis of effluent initially containing calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+) and bicarbonate/carbonate (HCO3-/CO32-). As predicted by a new model taking into account the concomitant H-2 evolution reaction (HER), more mineral scaling (Mg(OH)(2) and CaCO3) was observed in decreasing order of d(elec) from 3 mm to 100 mu m at 4 mA cm(-2) . Contrastingly, no deposit was present at the lowest d(elec) (50 mu m), which was due to non-faradaic condition. The applied cathode potential (E-C) decreased with increase of d(elec), which intensified the H-2 gas bubbles production and minimized the electro-precipitation. Supplementary experiments with identical E-C highlighted the additional involvement of O-2 evolution at the anode towards the cathodic mineral scaling, whose role was intensified at submillimetric distances. Finally, novel predictive correlations have been proposed from impedance spectroscopy studies at cathode/electrolyte interface in order to link the charge transfer resistance (R-CT) and the double-layer capacitance (C-DL) with d(elec).									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000772753400006

An increase in the applied voltage forms microbubbles after water fills the capillary. A further increase in the voltage generates a surface discharge through the boundary of the bubble, elongating the bubble shape, and eventually forming plasma by electrical breakdown. This produces atomic oxygen, atomic hydrogen, and hydroxyl radicals from dissociation of water vapor. Also, a bactericidal test in normal saline solution showed that more than 99.6% of the bacterial cells were killed within 8 s, resulting from chlorine-containing species, in particular hypochlorous acid as a major bactericidal agent.

In this work, Ni films were deposited by the galvanostatic method on gold electrodes. The electrocatalytic activity for the electro-oxidation of methanol from these deposits was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and sampled current voltammetry (SCV). Cyclic voltammetry measurements showed that depending on the Au electrode roughness, the position NiOOH formation peak of the electrodeposited Ni deposits could differ. The deposits were divided depending on whether the NiOOH formation peak was below or above 0.39 V vs. Ag|AgCl reference electrode. Sampled current voltammograms showed that the former presented greater specificity for the oxidation of methanol, and the latter, showed electrocatalytic activity for both the oxidation of methanol and for the oxygen evolution reaction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1938-5862			INSPEC:20328779

In such a context, CO2 electrocatalytic reduction has been hotly studied due to the merits of ambient operational conditions and easy control of the reaction process by changing the applied potential. Among the various systems studied, Cu and Au are found to possess the highest Faradaic efficiency toward cathodic electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to hydrocarbons and CO, respectively. However, both of them suffer from large overpotentials owing to the limitations imposed by the scaling relations between the carbonaceous adsorbates. Therefore, establishing how to break the scaling relations for effective electrochemical conversion of CO2 has become an urgent research topic. The recent advances in breaking the adsorption energy scaling relations to reduce the overpotential, improve the catalytic activity and suppress the side reaction, are summarized. The origin of the scaling relations, their negative effects on CO2 electrocatalysis, and the strategies for breaking the limitations are discussed. Some suggestions for future study are also proposed.									240	7	0	0	15	1	240			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000383777300012

We will show that this in situ technique allows identifying the individual role of chemicals in the reaction media, helping our understanding of nanomaterial synthesis. We will notably demonstrate the key role of capping agents in anisotropic growth and selective etching processes which illustrate the necessity to consider the hybrid nature (i.e. organic/inorganic) of functional nanomaterials to unravel their formation mechanisms. We have also used gas-cell TEM to identify the nature of the active sites for O2 and H2 adsorption/dissociation on gold nanoparticles supported on TiO2.

However, exploring the promising electrocatalysts with high stability, activity and selectivity for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is still an important and long-standing challenge to accelerate the green production of NH3. Herein, through the first-principles high-throughput screening, we systematically investigated the potentiality of single transitionmetal (TM) anchored on defective C3N monolayer as TM-VCC candidates for N-2 fixation. We carried out a comprehensive screening and systematical evaluation for stability, catalytic activity and selectivity toward NRR on TMVCC candidates. Our results reveal that, among 26 candidates, Mn-VCC can significantly suppress HER and exhibit the outstanding NRR activity, with themost favorable limiting potential of -0.75 V through the distal pathway, which is better than the currently stepped catalyst Ru (0001). More impressively, such a satisfactory NH3 conversion is primarily ascribed to the strong back-donation interactions between d-electrons ofMn atomand the anti-orbitals of N-2 molecule, aswell as efficient charge transfer of electrochemical process. Our findings not only broaden the development prospect of SACs for N-2 reduction but also pave a way for rational design and rapid screening of highly active C3N-based catalysts for NRR.

Benefiting from the cactus-like architecture for fast mass transfer and more accessible active sites, and strong synergistic effects induced by the formation of Fe-B bond for optimizing electrical conductivity, as well as facilitating the generation of CoOOH unveiled by in situ UV-vis measurement during the OER process, CoB2O4@FeOOH/NF shows superior OER performance with a low overpotential of 255 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), and robust stability for 100 h at 100 mA cm(-2). The two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer (CoB2O4@FeOOH/NF||Pt/C/NF) using CoB2O4@FeOOH/NF as the anode requires a low cell voltage of 1.576 V at 100 mA cm(-2) for driving water splitting, and maintains steadily for 125 h without attenuation at 300 mA cm(-2).

Herein, we employed trace transition metals (TM) as dopants to induce the charge redistribution of CoP for the opti-mization of the intermediate adsorption/desorption. Electrocatalysts composed of a trace TM modified CoP (denoted as TM-CoP, TM = Ni, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu) nanoparticles anchoring on N-doped carbon were fabricated using a one-step low-temperature phosphorization. The introduction of TM atoms can modulate the electronic configuration of Co and P, and in-turns regulate the adsorption/desorption capacities of reactants. The carbon skeleton derived from ZIF-67 increases the efficiency of charge transfer/mass transport. The obtained Ni-CoP-2 (Ni: 2 wt%) catalyst possesses small overpotentials of 110 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 157 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH electrolytes, respectively. In addition, a water splitting electrolyzer assembled by Ni-CoP-2 can reach 10 mA cm-2 at a low hydrolysis potential of 1.69 V. This work proposes an electronic structure tailoring approach through trace heteroatom involvement to improve catalytic activity for total hydrolysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0306-2619	1872-9118		WOS:000868969600001

Herein we describe the recent progress on engineering the electrode-electrolyte and semi-conductor-cocatalyst interfaces with cocatalysts, electrolytes, and interfacial layers (interlayers) to increase the PEC efficiency. Introducing cocatalysts has been demonstrated to be the most efficient way to lower the reaction barrier and promote charge injection to the reactants. In addition, it has been found that electrolyte ions can influence the surface catalysis remarkably. Electrolyte cations on the surface can influence the water splitting and backward reactions, and anions may take part in the proton transfer processes, indicating that fine-tuning of the electrolyte parameters turns out to be an important strategy for enhancing the PEC efficiency. Moreover, careful modification of the interface between the cocatalysts and the semiconductor via suitable interlayers is critical for promoting charge separation and transfer, which can indirectly influence the surface catalysis. The mechanisms of surface catalysis are assumed to involve transfer of photogenerated holes to the surface active sites to form high-valent species, which then oxidize the water molecules. Many key scientific issues about the generation of photovoltage, the separation, storage, and transfer of carriers, the function of cocatalysts, the roles of electrolyte ions, and the influences of other parameters during PEC water splitting will be discussed in detail with some perspective views.									374	26	0	0	17	1	381			2155-5435			WOS:000391783200075

The experiments involved heating 49-54 mg batches of 63-125 mu m neat soil particles, thinly spread on a 0.001 in. thick stainless steel foil, at nominal rates of 1000 degrees C/s, to temperatures in the 350-1050 degrees C range, under 3 psig of helium. Above 500-600 degrees C the total weight loss increased strongly with increasing temperature. Devolatilization exceeded 21 wt % when soil was heated to 1033 degrees C and then maintained at this temperature for 5 s before cooling. For this heating regimen, CO2, CO, and tars were the major volatile products, material and carbon balances were good, but oxygen balances were only fair and hydrogen balances were poor, possibly because yields of chemical water were not quantified. A single first-order reaction kinetics model well describes the global release rates of most gaseous volatiles except CO2, which, because of apparent step-like evolution, is better fitted by a model consisting of two independent parallel first-order reactions. A multiple independent parallel first-order reaction kinetics model provides a good fit to the soil weight loss data.									19	0	0	0	13	0	19			0888-5885			WOS:A1996VB61000027		
J	Frangini, S.; Paoletti, C.; Della Seta, L.								Corrosion of inconel alloys for application as inert anodes in low-temperature molten carbonate electrolysis processes								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				46	28			14953	14961		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.06.028		APR 2021		APR 21 2021	2021	In this work, five different Inconel alloys were investigated as stable CO2/O-2 evolving anodes for possible use in molten carbonate CO2 and H2O electrolysis or CO2/H2O coelectrolysis processes. Experiments were conducted in the molten ternary Li2CO3-Na2CO3-K2CO3 carbonate eutectic at 500 degrees C, under a CO2 gas atmosphere. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic polarization using DC and pulsed modes of current application were used to evaluate the influence of chemical composition on the Inconel corrosion behavior and anode stability. Results indicated that Ti and Al alloying elements are critical factors in promoting Inconel alloy passivation in molten carbonates, thus allowing high anode stability to be achieved during multiple voltammetric cycles with electrodes made of Inconel 617, 718 and X-750 alloys. It was also found that the mode of current application dramatically affects the galvanostatic polarization results. Although rapid anode degradation was invariably observed in all the Inconel electrodes subjected to DC polarization, electrodes of Inconel 617 and Inconel X-750 alloys were totally immune to anode degradation under pulsed polarization conditions, thus confirming the anode stabilizing effect of (Ti + Al) alloying. The Inconel 617 showed also an excellent gas evolution electrocatalytic activity probably because of its high Co content. Active oxygen formation during anodic gas evolution was a hypothesized mechanism to explain the galvanostatic results. Drastic drop of active oxygen concentration and in particular of the corrosive superoxide ion is supposed to occur on the anode surface during the pulse off-time periods, thus improving Inconel anode stability.

The Rietveld refined XRD data confirmed the phase purity and tetragonal crystal structure up to x = 0.08. An additional hexagonal Fe doped BaSrTiO3 phase along with small amount of segregated Fe2O3 was also detected in x >= 0.08 samples. The average grain size as measured using FESEM was observed to be approximate to 0.67 mu m. The presence of both Fe2+/ Fe3+ ions in all the samples and a decreasing Fe3+ concentration with x was confirmed using XPS analysis. The remnant polarization value was found to decrease with increasing Fe concentration. The magnetization data reveal that all the samples exhibit magnetic ordering with x = 0.08 sample exhibiting best magnetic parameters. The M-E coupling strength approximate to 10.05 and 9.62% has been observed in x = 0.08 and x = 0.10 samples. The conductivity vs frequency measurements (at different temperatures) reveal that the samples conduct via correlated barrier hopping of electrons trapped at the singly charged oxygen vacancy sites.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0947-8396	1432-0630		WOS:000691429200002

Herein, catalyst nanoarchitecturing via functionally implanted cobalt nanoparticles in N-doped carbon host is fabricated by an ultrasonic method combined with controlled calcination process and served as an effective electrocatalyst for Li-O-2 batteries. The synthesized catalyst holds a three-dimensional porous network structure, which could offer numerous active sites and provide the channels for mass transfer. When employed as an oxygen electrode, the Li-O-2 battery shows improved discharge capacity of 3862 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 0.1 mA cm(-2) and superior cycling stability up to 40 cycles with a limited capacity of 500 mA h g(-1), owing to the porous carbon substrate with highly graphitic and better catalytic activity of implanted Co nanoparticles. The N-doped carbon with a high degree of graphitization is obtained by a catalytic pyrolysis method and Co as main catalyst also give a good reference for future design of efficient catalysts for electrochemical application.									19	1	0	0	1	0	19			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000436914100014

Herein, a photocatalytic system with a unique combination of P-doped Zn0.5Cd0.5S (pZCS) and noble-metal-free CoP is first fabricated to evaluate the synergy between them. The resultant sample achieves a significantly boosted photocatalytic H-2 evolution reaction (HER) with a rate of 5488.8 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), which is an almost 50-fold enhancement from its pristine ZCS counterpart. Impressively, the CoP-pZCS composite also demonstrates overall water splitting where no sacrificial reagent is used, with an H-2 evolution rate of 154.6 mu mol g(-1) h(-1). The sample is then tested for its HER activity in seawater, and 3956.0 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) of H-2 is acquired. The main factor that contributes to its high performance in seawater despite various distractions coming from the abundance of ions present is the synergistic relation between pZCS and CoP. The midgap state procured through the introduction of the P dopant has excellent electron-hole separating ability, and CoP further serves as an electron sink where the photogenerated electrons can rapidly assemble. Ultimately, the charge carrier recombination within the resultant composite is greatly hindered, thus a spectacular photocatalytic HER in seawater is enabled.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2367-198X			WOS:000646078000001

Measurement of absorbance at nine wavelengths enabled the determination of the evolution of CH 4 , C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 5 OH, CO, CH 2 O and CH 3 CHO during the pyrolysis of 2% C 2 H 5 OH/Argon mixtures. These measurements enabled almost complete tracking of oxygen and carbon during pyrolysis. The performance of five recently developed kinetic models was evaluated against the measurements. It was found that none of these models could reconcile all the measured time-histories simultaneously. Sensitivity and Rate-of-production analysis revealed that the thermal decomposition and H-abstraction reactions of ethanol are the key reactions that have a controlling influence on the species time-histories. Additional experiments were designed and conducted to infer the rate constants of these reactions. The details of these experiments, the rate constant determination methodology, and the implications of the updated rate constants on the model performance are discussed in the companion paper [1] . To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first detailed study of ethanol pyrolysis involving simultaneous measurement of multiple species in a shock tube using laser absorption spectroscopy.

High surface areas, tunable porosity, and functionalization are considered to be crucial to enhance the catalytic performance of carbon-based materials. Recently, the newly emerging metal organic frameworks (MOFs) built from metal ions and polyfunctional organic ligands have proved to be promising self-sacrificing templates and precursors for preparing various carbon-based nanomaterials, benefiting from their high BET surface areas, abundant metal/organic species, large pore volumes, and extraordinary tunability of structures and compositions. In comparison with other carbon-based catalysts, MOF-derived carbon-based nanomaterials have great advantages in terms of tailorable morphologies and hierarchical porosity and easy functionalization with other heteroatoms and metal/metal oxides, which make them highly efficient as catalysts directly or as catalyst supports for numerous important reactions. In this perspective, we intend to give readers a survey of the research advances in the use of MOFs as self-sacrificing templates and precursors to prepare carbon-based nanomaterials, mainly including heteroatom-doped porous carbons and metal/metal oxide decorated porous carbons for applications as catalysts in energy and environment-related electrocatalysis and traditional heterogeneous catalysis. Finally, some perspectives are provided for future developments and directions of MOF-derived carbon-based materials for catalysis.									815	43	0	0	81	0	827			2155-5435			WOS:000382714000028

The new model allows rigorous material and energy balances including rigorous treatment of drop-gas energy exchanges using a thermodynamic approach. A set of thermodynamic properties is computed for the black liquor solids based on the heating value of the liquor, the elemental analysis, and a heat-capacity algorithm. The processes of drying, devolatilzation (pyrolysis) and char burning are treated as occurring in parallel, eliminating the need for arbitrary criteria for transitions between process steps. Drying rates are computed using the local water vapor pressure (dependent on solids content and temperature) and a mass transfer resistance. The rates of volatilization of carbon and sulfur during pyrolysis are determined from Kobayashi-type models. Stochiometric algorithms tied to the volatilizing gas species are used to compute the rates of release of the elements hydrogen and oxygen. Evolution of Na, K, Cl, and residual C occur as a result of char burning reactions. These include reactions between char components and with furnace gases. Rate equations for the latter type of reactions combine mass transfer and chemical kinetic resistances. A NOx formation model tied to fuel N content is also included. The new model allows computation of parameters that relate directly to boiler fouling and plugging (the amount and composition of carryover, the amount and composition of other aerosols, and furnace exit gas velocity and temperature profiles). It also allows the prediction of the concentrations of air emissions, including TRS, CO, VOC, SO2, and NOx.

J	ZHANG, YX; FIELD, RJ								SIMPLIFICATION OF A MECHANISM OF THE METHYLENE-BLUE HS--O2 CSTR OSCILLATOR - A HOMOGENEOUS OSCILLATORY MECHANISM WITH NONLINEARITIES BUT NO AUTOCATALYSIS								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY				95	2			723	727		10.1021/j100155a043				JAN 24 1991	1991	Oscillations may be observed in the concentrations of the colored form of methylene blue (MB+) and oxygen during the methylene blue catalyzed oxidation of HS- by O2 in a continuous-flow stirred tank reactor (CSTR). Oscillations have not been observed in a closed reactor. The major reactive intermediates are MB., HS., H2O2, and O2-. A mechanism for this chemical oscillator proposed by Resch, Field, Schneider, and Burger has been simplified from 14 chemical reactions involving seven variables to eight chemical reactions involving five variables. This simplification allows the dynamic structure of the mechanism to be understood. In contrast with all but one other proposed oscillatory mechanism in completely homogeneous solution, this mechanism does not involve autocatalysis, although it does contain nonlinearities. The source of the oscillations is a double inhibition of radical-chain processes. That is, O2 inhibits the reduction of MB+ to MBH+ until MB+/MB. catalyzes the removal of most of the O2, while a product of the reduction, HS., inhibits the oxidation of MBH back to MB+ until it is in turn removed by O2, whose concentration is replenished by the CSTR flow. The latter inhibition occurs by the rapid reaction of O2- with HS., as it is O2- rather than O2 that actually reoxidizes MBH to MB+. The simplified model can be reduced even further to a less chemically accurate skeleton that also shows oscillations only in a CSTR.									30	1	0	0	3	0	30			0022-3654			WOS:A1991EU48600043

The O Is or N Is spectra were collected every 14 s while the surface was continuously exposed to a steady NO gas pressure. The difference in the binding: energies for the atomic oxygen (O Is less than or equal to 530.2 eV), atomic nitrogen (N Is similar to 397.2 eV) and molecular upright bonded NO molecules (O Is greater than or equal to 531.0 eV and N Is similar to 400 eV) allowed us to distinguish these surface species and to follow the evolution of the adsorbate layer. In addition to these dominating surface species a new species, characterized by O Is binding energy of 530.7 eV and N Is binding energy similar to that of the atomic nitrogen, was detected within a narrow coverage range. This state is tentatively assigned to a "lying down" NO bonding configuration, detectable at the timescale of the measurements. The uptake plots, constructed using the integrated intensity of the deconvoluted O Is and N Is spectra, are used to elucidate the effect of the reaction temperature and surface coverage and composition on the kinetics of dissociative and molecular NO adsorption of Rh(110).

The investigated architecture comprises a Ru(II) dye-sensitized TiO2 substrate tethered to an IrO2 nanoparticle catalyst. Our realistic modeling strategy and quantitative analysis of the relevant interfacial hole/electron transfer reactions indicates the slow hole injection into IrO2 and the fast dye excited-state quenching to IrO2 as the primary sources of the relatively poor cell efficiency experimentally observed. On the basis of this atomistic and electronic structure information, we propose and computationally test, against a prototype dye, a new class of Ru(II) sensitizers, which show potentially improved photoelectrochemical performances. This study constitutes a first step toward the computer-assisted design of new and more efficient materials for solar fuels production through dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells.									52	5	2	0	3	0	55			0002-7863			WOS:000354338500024	25866864

Solid state synthesis with different NpO(2)/Na(2)O ratios led to the following polycrystalline compounds: Na(2)Np(2)O(7) monoclinic (P12(1)1), alpha-Na(2)NpO(4) orthorhombic (Pbam), beta-Na(2)NpO(4) orthorhombic (Pbca), beta-Na(4)NpO(5) tetragonal (I4/mmm), Na(5)NpO(6) monoclinic (C2/m) and a cubic compound (Fm-3m) that could either be Na(3)NpO(4) or Na(4)NpO(4).

The photoelectrochemical (PEC) system, which produce hydrogen using water splitting by solar energy, is one of the most promising energy systems because it has abundant energy sources and good theoretical efficiency. GaN has recently been regarded as suitable photoelectrode that could be used to split water to generate hydrogen without extra bias because its band edge position include water redox potential (Vredox= 1.23 vs. SHE). GaN also shows considerable corrosion resistance in aqueous solutions and it is possible to control its properties, such as structure, band gap, and catalyst characteristics, in order to improve solar energy conversion efficiency. But, even if the band edge position of GaN make PEC reaction facilitate without bias, the overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction could reduce the efficiency of system. One of the ways to decrease overpotential is introduction of co-catalyst on photoelectrode. In this paper, we will investigate the effect of manganese dioxide (MnO2) as a co-catalyst. MnO2 particles were dispersed on GaN photoelectrode by spincoater and analyzed properties of the PEC system using potentiostat (PARSTAT4000). After coating MnO2, the flat-band potential (Vfb) and the onset voltage (Vonset) were moved negatively by 0.195 V and 0.116 V, respectively. The photocurrent density increased on MnO2 coated sample and time dependence was also improved. These results showed MnO2 has an effect as a co-catalyst and it would enhance the efficiency of overall PEC system.				수소를 생산하는 방법 중 하나로, 광전기화학적(photoelectrochemical; PEC) 물 분해 시스템은 높은 이론적 효율을 가진 친환경적이고 경제적인 방법이다. 광전극으로서 질화갈륨(gallium nitride; GaN)은 내화학성이 좋고 밴드갭이물의 산화환원준위(Vredox = 1.23 V vs. SHE)를 포함하여 외부 전압 없이 수소를 생산할 수 있는 시스템을 구축할 수 있다. 그러나 이때 발생하는 높은 산소 발생 과전압은 시스템의 반응 효율을 저하시킨다. 산소 발생 과전압을 줄이기 위한방법으로 광전극에 조촉매를 이용하는 방법이 많이 알려져 있다. 본 연구에서는 GaN 광전극에 입자 형태의 이산화망간(manganese dioxide; MnO2)을 조촉매로 도입하여 PEC 시스템의 특성을 분석하고자 한다. MnO2가 광전극에 잘 형성되었는지를 확인하기 위하여 표면분석을 수행하였고, potentiostat(PARSTAT4000)을 이용해 PEC 특성을 분석해 평가하였다. MnO2가 코팅됨에 따라 flat-band potential(Vfb)과 onset voltage(Vonset)가 각각 음의 방향으로 0.195 V, 0.116 V 이동하는 것이 확인되었다. 광전류밀도 값에 대해서도 MnO2 코팅 샘플이 더 높게 나타나며, 시간에 따른 광전류의 저하도 개선되었다. 이로부터 MnO2이 조촉매로서 효과가 있음을 확인하였고, PEC 시스템 전반에 걸쳐 효율 향상에 기여할 수 있을 것으로 기대된다.					1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1226-9360			KJD:ART002186906

The maximum effect of H2O2 on guard cells was observed at 10(-4) M. By switching on non-cyclic electron transfer in chloroplasts menadione and methyl viologen intensified H2O2 generation in the light, but prevented the CN--induced apoptosis in guard cells. The light stimulation of CN- effect on guard cell apoptosis cannot be caused by disturbance of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase function and associated OH center dot generation in chloroplasts with participation of free transition metals in the Fenton or Haber-Weiss type reactions as well as with participation of the FeS clusters of the electron acceptor side of Photosystem 1. Menadione and methyl viologen did not suppress the CN--induced apoptosis in epidermal cells that, unlike guard cells, contain mitochondria only, but not chloroplasts. Quinacrine and diphenylene iodonium, inhibitors of NAD(P)H oxidase of cell plasma membrane, had no effect on the respiration and photosynthetic O-2 evolution by leaf slices, but prevented the CN--induced guard cell death. The data suggest that NAD(P)H oxidase of guard cell plasma membrane is a source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) needed for execution of CN--induced programmed cell death. Chloroplasts and mitochondria were inefficient as ROS sources in the programmed death of guard cells. When ROS generation is insufficient, exogenous H2O2 exhibits a stimulating effect on programmed cell death.

More atomically dispersed Pt and abundant Pt-O-Ce structures were observed in the Pt/CA-c catalyst than in the Pt/CA-n catalyst. Both parent catalysts received significant enhancement on their catalytic CO oxidation activities if activated by 10% hydrogen at 400 degrees C before reaction. Between the two representative catalysts, the extent of activity enhancement upon activation was more pronounced for Pt/CA-c. We found that smaller Pt clusters with more active ionic Pt sites were generated on the activated Pt/CA-c catalyst, while agglomerated larger Pt particles with more metallic sites were formed on the activated Pt/CA-n. The facile formation of Ce(3+)was also indicative of more active metal-support interfaces in the activated Pt/CA-c catalyst. These results highlight the importance of regulating ceria support particles to enable a controlled anchoring and subsequent activation of Pt single atoms for low-temperature CO oxidation reaction.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			2199-692X			WOS:000574155900001

Thermokinetic properties as a mean for better understanding the nature of combustion process can be determined by an experiment using a Drop Tube Test Facility (DTTF) described thereinafter in this paper. The DTTF provides conditions occurring in a pulverized coal fired boiler by emulated oxygen concentration, temperature and reaction gas velocity. The DTTF presented in the paper was built recently at the Energy Research Center. Experimental data acquired from the DTTF are used in mathematical modeling using the code Fluent. The ANSYS Fluent 12.0 code can define different mathematical models of volatile evolution (devolatilization model) and char combustion (kinetic/diffusion surface reaction rate model) to simulate coal combustion. The single kinetic rate devolatilization model assumes that the rate of devolatilization is of first-order and the kinetic/diffusion-limited rate model assumes that the char combustion rate is determined either by kinetics or by a diffusion rate. In this paper, a char combustion model is defined in detail with specification of a basic equation for char combustion reaction rate. Then, an equation of particle temperature is defined for char combustion. Different values of activation energy and a pre-exponential factor are defined in an equation for calculation of the rate constant by Arrhenius. Resulting values are evaluated by decrease of pulverized coal char in the drop tube in dependence of time. The process of burnout is evaluated for comparison with experimental tests.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1425-5960			WOS:000277070500019

The asphaltenes recovered from the experiments were characterized by FT-IR, synchronous UV fluorescence, Py-GC-MS, and elemental analysis. The results show that important modifications related to the physicochemical maturation conditions affect the asphaltenes: (i) The asphaltenes yields are modified by temperature, pressure and by the presence of water. (ii) A progressive defunctionalization and increased aromatic content during maturation is recorded by the asphaltenes. This phenomenon is retarded by the presence of water in hydrous conditions. (iii) The asphaltenes expelled during hydrous pyrolysis have a different composition than the asphaltenes remaining in the bitumen. (iv) Data on the oxygen content of the asphaltenes strongly support the occurrence of interactions between asphaltenes and water, both in confined and hydrous pyrolysis. Therefore, it is suggested that hydrogen transfer reactions between water and the newly formed hydrocarbons are catalyzed by the asphaltenes and are based on a combination of reduction and oxidation reactions through a radical ion mechanism. (v) A comparison with the elemental composition of the residual kerogen leads to the conclusion that the excess of CO2 generated during hydrous pyrolysis is related to the oxidation of the asphaltenes. The study of the asphaltenes can bring important information concerning the chemical processes taking place during artificial maturation. It appears that the asphaltenes are not simple intermediates between the kerogen and the hydrocarbons during oil generation, but they actively participate to the chemical reactions involved in maturation.

Herein, a novel photocatalyst is synthesized by anchoring copper sulfide nanoparticles on oxygen-doped graphitic carbon nitride hollow nanospheres. g-C3N4 is bent to form a nanosphere structure, which promotes the interlayer photogenerated charge transfer, improves the specific surface area, and provides more reaction sites. Moreover, the hollow structure can enhance the utilization of light through the reflection and refraction of light in the cavity. The hollow nanospheres structure has a large number of reaction sites and enhanced light absorption due to internal reflection. After the introduction of copper sulfide, a built-in electric field is formed, which improves the separation and transmission of photogenerated carriers, and extends the light response range into the near-infrared (NIR) region. Consequently, the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of phenol and diclofenac reach 100% after vis-NIR irradiation for only 25 and 30 min, respectively. The radical trapping experiments and electron spin resonance analysis show that center dot O-2(-) plays an important role in the photodegradation process. This work provides a strategy for constructing broad-spectrum response photocatalysts.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2367-198X			WOS:000590566900001		
J	Gao, Bin; Wu, Caifang; Song, Yu; Zhou, Dan; Niu, Qinghe; Zhou, He; Jiang, Xiuming								Structural characterization of high fidelity for bituminous and semi-anthracite: Insights from spectral analysis and modeling								FUEL				315						123183	10.1016/j.fuel.2022.123183				MAY 1 2022	2022	Although molecular structure evolution in response to coalification process has been reported to be prevalent recently, their characterization accuracy for coals of different ranks still needs to be enhanced. In this paper, the occurrence information of the carbon skeleton structure, functional groups, and nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms in coals of different ranks (R-o,R-max = 0.99% for XZ-02, 1.39% for YT-09, 1.63% for YT-1 1, 2.29% for ZC-1 5) were extracted via ultimate and spectrum analysis. Then four molecular structure models were created using computer-aided molecular design (CAMD). Results show that the oxygen atoms in coal primarily exhibit phenolic hydroxyl groups, ether groups, and carbonyl groups. The nitrogen heteroatoms are present as pyrrole and protonated pyridine, and the sulfur heteroatoms mainly served as thiophene. The content of aliphatic structures gradually decreased as coalification continued. Their length first decreased (R-o,R-max < 1.9%) and subsequently increased (R-o,R-max > 1.9%). The content of aromatic structures gradually increased accompanied by the gradually cleaving of oxygen functional groups and alkyl side chain from the aromatic clusters. Hence, the degree of aromatization gradually increased, and condensation reactions dominated in the late stage of coalification. The initial molecular formulas and structural models were determined for the four coals. Also, the bonding modes among the aromatic clusters, aliphatic side chains, and oxygen functional groups within the molecular structure were adjusted based on the comparison between experiment and calculation spectra, finally creating the following molecular representations: C17H128O8N2 (XZ-02), C167H114O5N2S2 (YT-09), C151H96O7N2 (YT-11), and C146H80O4N2 (ZC-1 5). The fitting carbon spectra of these molecular representations were consistent with the experimental carbon spectra whose error is within the allowable range (relative error < 15%), verifying the applicability of the molecular structure model and the above method. Furthermore, the mechanism of coalification was discussed based on the variations of the side chains and chemical bonds. The above research can provide a theoretical reference for the molecular structural evolution for coals of different ranks and a high fidelity method to create molecular structure representation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000747449400001

Microstructural evolution of the base material and thickness of the oxide layers were assessed as a function of composition. Some of the observations with regard to the evolved base metal microstructure, including: a lath and beta rib/precipitates and lamellar structure, were found to be comparable to what is reported for Ti-Mo system. It was also shown that formation of a thinner oxide does not necessarily imply on the lower oxygen ingress. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Our calculations indicate that PtOx with a high concentration of oxygen binds more strongly to rutile than to anatase, indicating the formation of stronger interactions between Pt oxide and the rutile surface compared with anatase during the calcination stage under an oxidative atmosphere. X-ray photoelectron spectra quantification analysis illustrates that higher amounts of Pt oxide are obtained when impregnation is performed with a rutile support after calcination in comparison with that of anatase. After reduction, the stronger interaction between PtOx and rutile leads to a larger amount of partially charged and highly dispersed Pt nanoclusters on the surface, while the weaker interaction between PtOx and anatase illustrates the dispersion and sintering of higher amounts of metal nanoparticles on the anatase surface. Furthermore, the photocatalytic oxygen evolution test highlights the importance of understanding the interaction between the metal oxide and anatase/rutile for targeted synthesis of the supported catalyst.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000411862400044	28914946

The efficient MoOx catalyst stoichiometry on Si photocathode was optimized by controlling the deposition gas environment and the target during RF magnetron sputtering. The optimized MoOx stoichiometry on Si photocathode exhibited one of the highest photocurrent density of similar to-30 mA cm(-2) at -0.5 V vs RHE under AM 1.5 G illumination. Importantly, the deposition of MoOx on p-Si photocathode causes a significant cathodic shift in the overpotential, indicating the catalytic effect of MoOx. The valence band edge and electrochemical studies were used to analyze the band edge positions with respect to water redox potentials and the formation of p-n junction system. The results of this work demonstrate the advantage of employing a sulfur-free and oxygen-deficient MoOx catalyst on p-Si in p-n junction configuration for the efficient PEC water splitting process.									10	2	0	0	0	0	10			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000515195200067

Its main mechanism is thought to be Jeans escape of a steady hydrogen reservoir sourced from odd-oxygen reactions with near-surface water vapour(2,4,5). The observed escape rate, however, is strongly variable and correlates poorly with solar extreme-ultraviolet radiation flux(6-8), which was predicted to modulate escape(9). This variability has recently been attributed to hydrogen sourced from photolysed middle atmospheric water vapour(10), whose vertical and seasonal distribution is only partly characterized and understood(11-13). Here, we report multi-annual observational estimates of water content and dust and water transport to the middle atmosphere from Mars Climate Sounder data. We provide strong evidence that the transport of water vapour and ice to the middle atmosphere by deep convection in Martian dust storms can enhance hydrogen escape. Planet-encircling dust storms can raise the effective hygropause (where water content rapidly decreases to effectively zero) from 50 to 80 km above the areoid (the reference equipotential surface). Smaller dust storms contribute to an annual mode in water content at 40-50 km that may explain seasonal variability in escape. Our results imply that Martian atmospheric chemistry and evolution can be strongly affected by the meteorology of the lower and middle atmosphere of Mars.									84	3	0	0	3	0	84			2397-3366			WOS:000423482100012

I., Klimov, V. V., and Van Gorkom, H. J. (1996) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1273, 1-3]. Here it is shown by measurements of EPR signal II that oxidation of the secondary electron donor, Y-Z, is not inhibited. However, the reduction of Y-Z(+) is greatly slowed and occurs largely by back reaction with reduced accepters. Bicarbonate is shown to prevent the loss of fast electron donation to Y-Z(+). The release of about one or two free Mn2+ per photosystem II during formate treatment, and the fact that these effects are mimicked by Mn-depletion, suggests that formate may act by replacing a bicarbonate which is essential for Mn binding. Irreversible light-induced rebinding in an EPR-silent form of Mn2+ that was added to Mn-depleted DT-20 was indeed found to depend on the presence of bicarbonate, as did the reconstitution in such material of both the fast electron donation to Y-Z(+) and the UV absorbance changes characteristic of a functional oxygen-evolving complex. It is concluded that bicarbonate may be an essential ligand of the functional Mn cluster.									50	1	6	0	42	0	56			0006-2960			WOS:000071299600028	9405062

We have searched for complex organic molecules (COMs) in the young starless core L1521E, and report the first clear detection of dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3), methyl formate (HCOOCH3), and vinyl cyanide (CH2CHCN). Eight transitions of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) were also detected, five of which (A states) were used to determine an excitation temperature to then calculate column densities for the other oxygen-bearing COMs. If source size was not taken into account (i.e. if filling fraction was assumed to be one), column density was underestimated, and thus we stress the need for higher resolution mapping data. We calculated L1521E COM abundances and compared them to other stages of low-mass star formation, also finding similarities to other starless/pre-stellar cores, suggesting related chemical evolution. The scenario that assumes formation of COMs in gas-phase reactions between precursors formed on grains and then ejected to the cold gas via reactive desorption was tested and was unable to reproduce observed COM abundances, with the exception of CH3CHO. These results suggest that COMs observed in cold gas are formed not by gas-phase reactions alone, but also through surface reactions on interstellar grains. Our observations present a new, unique challenge for existing theoretical astrochemical models.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000661537200075

A simple model for diffusion and integration of a small number of chemical reaction rate equations allows simulations Of SiO2 photo-CVD to be performed, and this work shows that it is possible to assume that one SiOxHy, intermediate is the dominant precursor to SiO2 deposition. Three oxidants for use with SiH4 are investigated: O-2, H2O/O-2, and H2O2. The simulations allow determination of concentrations of important gas-phase species and estimated deposition rates as functions of time, probability of gas-phase species diffusing to the substrate and effective reaction chain length as functions of height, and deposition rate dependence on purge gas identity and vacuum ultraviolet light intensity. The results reflect our experimental results, including the dependence of deposition rate on experimental parameters and the time evolution of film growth, without adjusting known parameters (e.g., absorption coefficients, rate constants). The simulations provide strong support for the important role of the radical chain reaction OH + SiH4 = SiH3 + H2O; SiH3 + O-2 = SiH2O + OH. The simulations provide insight for the mechanism for SiO2 deposition by the thermal oxidation of SiH4 by O-2.									5	0	0	0	0	0	7			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000170621100010

Currently, because of its excellent electrical conductivity and good corrosion resistance in acidic media, cobalt phosphide (CoP) has become a representative non-noble-metal HER catalyst despite its inadequate catalytic activity. Herein, a strategy of multiple catalyst-structure engineering, which simultaneously includes doping, nanostructuring, and in situ nanocarbon coating, was employed to significantly improve the HER performance of CoP. CoP with optimized ruthenium doping and covered by ultrathin graphitic carbon shells shows remarkably high HER catalytic behaviour with a low overpotential of only 73mV at a current density of 10mAcm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 46mVdec(-1), close to that of the Pt/C benchmark, while maintaining excellent durability. Moreover, the ultrathin graphene shell has a significant positive effect on catalytic activity. This work demonstrates the necessity and validity of multifold structural control, which can be widely used to design various materials for different catalytic processes.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000445447300019	29981182

S-states test and flash induction test showed that Cr(VI) exposure increased the proportion of inactivated PSII (PSIIX) and PSII beta reaction centers, which increased the fluxes of dissipated energy. JIP test and Q(A)(-) reoxidation test demonstrated that Cr(VI) treatment induces inhibition of electron transport from Q(A)(-) to Q(B)/Q(B)(-) and accumulation of P-680(+).

Herein, ultrathin Fe-modified Ni hydroxysulfide (Fe-NiSOH) nanosheet arrays were grown in situ on Ni foam via a simple two-step oxidation strategy for efficient and stable large-current-density water/seawater oxidation. Systematic insights, including experimental and theoretical analysis, reveal that in situ S leaching from the electrode boosts its self-reconstruction and results in the more-ready generation of highly active Ni4+ species, which benefits from a reduced formation energy. Owing to its excellent physical and chemical properties, the Fe-NiSOH catalyst requires only low overpotentials of 207, 240, and 268 mV in alkaline water to deliver current densities of 10, 100, and 500 mA cm(-2), respectively, and it can work stably for 1100 hours at the commercially required current density of 500 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, it also exhibits excellent seawater oxidation activity and superior resistance to Cr corrosion, since it can run stably at 500 mA cm(-2) for over 900 hours. This work offers an efficient strategy to build rapidly self-reconstructing electrocatalysts to promote the formation of highly oxidized metal species for efficient and stable water/seawater oxidation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000860910300001

Emerging areas are identified that will require attention as the search continues for stable and efficient visible-light driven water oxidation systems that exploit the rational construction of different interface junctions. Increasing efforts have been focused on enhancing the performance of hematite-based photoanodes via morphology control, element doping, co-catalysts, surface modification, heterojunction construction, and via a combination between them. Particular attention has been given to heterojunctions, as these structures are more likely to utilize the benefits provided by combining elements with distinct properties, exhibiting functional behavior at the interfacial region, and increasing solar energy conversion by synergistic effects.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			2166-532X			WOS:000525259500001

The resulting CoOP@bio-C exhibits an overall superior ORR catalytic activity, stability and resistance to methanol crossover in alkaline media to commercial Pt/C, with onset and half-wave potentials of 0.91 and 0.81V in 0.1 M KOH, a limiting current density of -5.7 mA cm(-2), and a small Tafel slope of 57 mV dec(-1), representing the best result among the biomass-based carbon electrocatalysts. In particular, comparative studies reveal the significant effect of the work function of corresponding catalytic materials on the ORR electrocatalysis. Dual-doped CoOP@bio-C with a work function of 5.42 eV, closer to that of Pt (5.65 eV), displays much better electrocatalytic activity than single-doped Co3O4@bio-C, single-doped Co(PO3)(2)@bio-C and bio-C-800 catalysts with work functions of 8.35, 6.61 and 5.02 eV, respectively, due to its good adsorption nature to O-2 and desorption nature to the reaction intermediates. The present result will be surely helpful for the design and synthesis of biomass resource-based ORR catalysts with great application potential.									61	5	0	0	6	0	61			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000436516700045

While common strategies involve screening a wide range of materials with new chemical compositions or structures, a different approach to continuously, controllably, and effectively tune the electronic properties of existing catalytic materials for optimized activities has been demonstrated recently. Inspired by studies in lithium-ion batteries, systematical lithium electrochemical tuning (LiET) methods such as Li intercalation, extraction, cycling, and strain engineering, are employed to effectively tune the electronic structures of different existing catalysts and thus improve their catalytic activities dramatically. Herein, the advantages of the LiET method in electrocatalysis are introduced, and then some recent representative examples in improving the performances of important electrochemical reactions are reviewed briefly. Lastly, a few promising directions on extending the applications of the LiET method in electrocatalysis are proposed.									37	3	0	0	3	0	37			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000451568400021	30203515

The polymer electrolyte water electrolyzer (PEWE) has the potential to be a mainstay in the green hydrogen market in the future because of its superior performance. However, the development of PEWE is constrained by the slow progress of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA), which is an essential component of PEWE and largely determines the cost and performance of the system. Therefore, the MEA must be optimized from the aspects of reducing cost and improving performance to promote the development of PEWEs. In this review, we first discuss the recent progress of the materials and design strategies of MEA, including the cost, activity, and stability of catalysts, distribution and thickness of ionomers, and ion transport efficiency of ion exchange membranes (IEMs). Then, the effects of all components and interlayer interfaces on the ions, electrons, and mass transfer in MEA and, consequently, the performance of PEWE are analyzed. Finally, we propose perspectives on developing MEA by optimizing the catalyst activity and stability of IEM, interface contact between adjacent components, and evaluation methods of performance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000841718100005

Given their prominent presence and influence on the formation and evolution of celestial bodies, it is of fundamental interest to explore the nature of interactions between hydrogen and helium. Using an advanced crystal structure search method, we have identified a quaternary compound FeO2H2He stabilized in a wide range of P-T conditions. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations further reveal a novel superionic state of FeO2H2He hosting liquid-like diffusive hydrogen in the FeO2He sublattice, creating a conducive environment for H-He chemical association, at P-T conditions corresponding to the Earth's lowest mantle regions. To our surprise, this chemically facilitated coalescence of otherwise immiscible molecular species highlights a promising avenue for exploring this long-sought but hitherto unattainable state of matter. This finding raises strong prospects for exotic H-He mixtures inside Earth and possibly also in other astronomical bodies.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2095-5138	2053-714X		WOS:000834999200001	35928982

The electrodeposited composite coatings based on nickel seem to be very promising in this context. We studied the corrosion resistance of electrocatalytic Ni-TiO2 composite coatings fabricated by electrodeposition method using a plating solution based on deep eutectic solvents, a new environmentally friendly and affordable type of room-temperature ionic liquids. We investigated the corrosion behavior of Ni and Ni-TiO2 coatings (5 and 10 wt.% of TiO2) in a 3% NaCl aqueous solution as a corrosive medium. The corrosion parameters were determined by linear voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. It was established that the inclusion of titania particles in the Ni matrix and an increase in their content in the coating leads to a shift in corrosion potential towards positive values, a decrease in corrosion current density and an increase in polarization resistance. The observed effects of improving the corrosion resistance of coatings are associated with the barrier action of particles of the dispersed phase and the formation of corrosion microcells contributing to the inhibition of local corrosion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-6412		WOS:000815952000001

As a natural evolution to the rich oxidative chemistry that can mediate water oxidation catalysts, during the last decade, iron coordination complexes have emerged as a promising platform for investigation. In this chapter the main progress on the design of well-defined water oxidation (WO) catalysts based on iron is covered, as well as evidence for the WO proposed mechanisms. Ligand design is critical for the rationalization of the catalytic activity and therefore the different architectures are used as the crucial pillar structure of the chapter. Over the different sections, we present detailed characterization of reaction intermediates and provide insights into our understanding of the O-O bond formation event. In this regard, the most illustrative studies are those based on chemical oxidants. Electrocatalysis and electrode functionalization studies, although still very preliminary, indicate that possibilities toward applications could materialize. The few studies of the challenging light-driven water oxidation are also covered. Finally, multinuclear iron complexes are of particular interest, since they provide a clear route for the development of electrocatalysts. In addition, a discussion of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and polyoxometalates (POMs) is also included in this chapter.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			0898-8838	1557-8917	978-0-12-816082-4	WOS:000501573300005

In particular, the role of low to moderate heating temperatures, to the evolution of the original functional groups anchored on the GO skeleton, is closely investigated by Fourier transform infra red (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The study shows that, contrary to vacuum or inert ambient heating, heating under ambient atmosphere triggers concomitant reduction and oxidation reactions. Hydroxyl and epoxy groups are progressively eliminated, but at the same time newly formed carbonyls appear due to oxidation. Electrical measurements indicate that despite the presence of oxygen containing groups in the restored graphene sp(2) network, the conductivity enhances. The process, therefore, lends itself to the production of conductive reduced GO with increased functionalities suitable for application in gas sensor fabrication. The concept is evaluated with a humidity sensor where thermally reduced GO is prepared at different reduction temperatures. The evaluation unveils that a critical reduction temperature exists where sensor sensitivity is optimized. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Here, carbon nanotube-grafted, Co-Fe embedded, nitrogen-doped porous carbon nano-frameworks (CNT-Co-Fe/NC) were synthesized through the carbonization of Fe-doped zeolitic imidazolate frameworks and vulcanization of the CNT-Co-Fe/NC to form CNT-CoS2-Fe/NC. The CNT-CoS2-Fe/NC exhibited a superior OER performance with an overpotential of only 1.637 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and a Tafel slope of 197 mV/dec (which, for RuO2, is 112 mV/dec), whereas the CNT-Co-Fe/NC showed an excellent ORR performance with a Tafel slope of 71 mV/dec (which, for 20 wt% Pt/C, is 91 mV/dec). A ZAB was developed with a hybrid catalyst of 50 wt% CNT-Co-Fe/NC and 50 wt% CNT-CoS2-Fe/NC in the cathode, and it achieved an excellent specific discharge capacity of 814 mAh/g at 50 mA/cm(2), high power density of 245 mW/cm(2), and outstanding cycle stability of over 1800 cycles (300 h) at 10 mA/cm(2) with a very high retention of 95% and small potential gap of 0.68 V, compared to the corresponding values of 803.7 mAh/g, 215.3 mW/cm(2), 900 cycles: retention 92%, and potential gap 0.837 V for 150 h for the ZAB with a hybrid catalyst of Pt/C + RuO2. It is hypothesized that the ZAB with the novel hybrid catalyst exhibits its excellent catalytic activity and durability as a result of the synergistic effect of the catalyst's embedded heteroatoms and nitrogen-metal/carbon framework that enhances the ORR/OER performance, porous carbon nano-framework that enables rapid diffusion and electrical conduction, and carbon nanotubes that complete the external electrical connection between the catalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000747456300001

Further, an understanding of how the surface composition and structure of electrocatalysts may be controlled by external means is useful for their efficient production. Here, we report our study of surface composition and the dynamics involved in facet-dependent oxidation of equilibrium-shaped Pt3Co nanoparticles in an initially disordered state via in situ transmission electron microscopy and density functional calculations. In brief, using our advanced in situ gas cell technique, evolution of the surface of the Pt3Co nanoparticles was monitored at the atomic scale during their exposure to an oxygen atmosphere at elevated temperature, and it was found that Co segregation and oxidation take place on {111} surfaces but not on {100} surfaces.									45	5	0	0	4	0	48			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000407540300020	28686034

As ECL sensing platform, Au-Ag/g-C3N4 NCs could significantly improve the ECL intensity of luminol due to the good conductivity of Au-Ag NPs, electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the ability to adsorb luminol via p stacking interaction. In addition, it could load the thiol terminated aptamers of CEA via Au-S or Ag-S bonds. In the presence of CEA, the ECL response of the proposed biosensor decreased significantly due to the fact that the assembled protein layers hindered the electron transfer and the diffusion of ECL reactants toward the electrode surface. The proposed ECL sensor exhibited a good linear relationship with CEA in the range of 1.0-1.0 x 10(-6) ng/mL with a detection limit of 8.9 x 10(-7) ng/mL. The satisfactory results were obtained in the detection of CEA in human serum samples. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

Herein, by properly integrating an ultralow amount of Pt with earth-abundant elements, we report a facile dealloying-oxidation-phosphidation method for synthesizing a PtCu nanocluster decorated CoP nanosheet electrocatalyst (PtCu/CoP) with an ultralow Pt loading (2.8 mu g cm(-2)). With only 1/40 Pt loading of commercial 20% Pt/C, the as-prepared PtCu/CoP catalyst outperforms the Pt/C catalyst, requiring an overpotential as low as 20 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and showing a smaller Tafel slope of 28 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4. In 1.0 M KOH, the PtCu/CoP catalyst also shows a superior performance to that of Pt/C, with an overpotential of 40 mV (10 mA cm(-2)) and a Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1). Moreover, the PtCu/CoP catalyst can be continuously operated for 100 h in both acidic and alkaline media, with only insignificant degradation. This work provides an efficient strategy for designing a high performance HER electrocatalyst with ultralow Pt loadings.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2398-4902			WOS:000534220100043

Upon milling, RuO2 reacted with Ti to form Ti oxides. Ru-like hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) phase, and a cubic Ti-Ru(O) alloy. After 40 h of milling, the final product was primarily a Ti-Ru-O alloy with iron impurities from the steel balls and crucible. A high ball-to-powder weight ratio resulted in higher impurity (iron) content. Most of the iron in the powder did not exist as alpha-Fe particles but entered into the alloy lattice forming a Ti-Ru-(Fe)-(O) cubic phase. The incorporation of iron did not affect the catalytic performance very much. The electrocatalytical activity of the studied cathode materials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in a chlorate electrolyte was investigated by measuring the overpotential at 250 mA/cm(2) current density (eta(250)) Good performance was found for Ti/RuO2 ratios of 2:1 and 3:1. The HER eta(250) values for these electrodes were 300 mV lower than that for mild steel cathodes. The electrodes made of the new alloys were very stable in the chlorate electrolyte and had good resistance to poisoning from the solution. The origin of the catalytic activity resulted mainly from ruthenium, and the presence of titanium and oxygen in the alloys was indispensable for the stability of the electrodes.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:A1997YL46800037

The aqueous-phase chemistry and specific contributions of these species to the chemical and biocidal effects of air discharge plasma in water were evaluated using phenol as a chemical probe and bacteria Escherichia coli. The nitrated and nitrosylated products of phenol (4-nitrophenol, 2-nitrophenol, 4-nitrocatechol, 4-nitrosophenol) in addition to the hydroxylated products (catechol, hydroquinone, 1,4-benzoquinone, hydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone) evidenced formation of NO2 center dot, NO center dot and OH center dot radicals and NO+ ions directly by the air plasma at the gas-liquid interface and through post-discharge processes in plasma-activated water (PAW) mediated by peroxynitrite (ONOOH). Kinetic study of post-discharge evolution of H2O2 and NO2- in PAW has demonstrated excellent fit with the pseudo-second-order reaction between H2O2 and NO2-. The third-order rate constant k = 1.1 x 10(3)M(-2) s(-1) for the reaction NO2- + H2O2 + H+ -> ONOOH + H2O was determined in PAW at pH 3.3 with the rate of ONOOH formation in the range 10(-8)-10(-9) Ms-1. Peroxynitrite chemistry was shown to significantly participate in the antibacterial properties of PAW. Ozone presence in PAW was proved indirectly by pH-dependent degradation of phenol and detection of cis, cis-muconic acid, but contribution of ozone to the inactivation of bacteria by the air plasma was negligible.									692	31	2	0	176	1	710			0963-0252	1361-6595		WOS:000332289800025

The development of efficient and durable electrocatalysts for water splitting plays a crucial role in the energy conversion and storage process. Nickel selenide (NixSey), as a typical multifunctional electrocatalyst, has attracted great consideration owning to its component diversity, high conductivity, and regulated morphology/electronic structures. In NixSey, nickel has a unique valence electron configuration (3d(8)4s(2)) and acts as the main catalytic activity site. Compared with S and O, Se in NixSey not only has the same valence electrons and oxidation number but also has excellent intrinsic metal properties, which means better electrical conductivity and electrocatalytic activity. In addition, Ni and Se could form stoichiometric compounds (NiSe, NiSe2, Ni3Se2, Ni3Se4) and nonstoichiometric compounds (Ni0.85Se), which is ascribed to the electronegativity difference between Ni (1.9) and Se (2.4). In this review, the crystal structure, preparation methods, and practical applications of NixSey-based electrocatalysts are summarized. The merits and limitations of nickel selenide are discussed in terms of structure and composition. Finally, the challenges and opportunities faced by NixSey-based electrocatalysts in water splitting are discussed.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000697334900004

These microorganisms as higher plants, can use light energy to split water molecules and evolve oxygen in a process that produce storable energy-rich products from atmospheric carbon dioxide. Algae and cyanobacteria which can grow in the presence of nutrients and carbonate are expected to be utilised to maintain an oxygen-atmosphere and to constitute biomass in space shuttles.Irradiation was performed in gamma Co-60-sources of different activities; fluorescence techniques in vivo and SDS-PAGE analysis in vitro were used to determine PS-II efficiency during radiation stress. We determined the radiation target on PS-H by immunoblot. We built a miniaturised growth box that preserves constant pressure and temperature to measure automatically photosynthetic activity by a fluorescence sensor, directly in space during a mission in an ASI balloon.

In recent years, a vast collection of research has explored the possibility of reducing the Pt content in such catalysts by alloying with earth-abundant and cheap metals, enabling co-optimization of cost and activity. Here, using nanoparticle beam deposition, we explore the electrocatalytic performance of PtCu alloy clusters in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Elemental compositions of the produced bimetallic clusters were shown by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to range from 2 at. % to 38 at. % Pt, while high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) combined with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy indicated that the predominant cluster morphologies could be characterized as either a fully mixed alloy or as a mixed core with a Cu-rich shell. In contrast with previous studies, a monotonic decrease in HER activity with increasing Cu content was observed over the composition range studied, with the current density measured at -0.3 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) scaling approximately linearly with Pt at. %. This trend opens up the possibility that PtCu could be used as a reference system for comparing the composition-dependent activity of other bimetallic catalysts.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000587720300023	33154785

The oxide coatings on titanium were prepared by the sol-gel procedure from a mixture of inorganic oxide sols, which were obtained by forced hydrolysis of metal chlorides. The morphology of the coating was examined by scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical properties of activated titanium anodes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and polarization measurements in a H2SO4- and NaCl-containing electrolyte, as well as in seawater sampled on the Adriatic coast in Tivat, Montenegro. The anode stability during operation in seawater was investigated by the galvanostatic accelerated corrosion stability test. The morphology and electrochemical characteristics of the ternary coating are compared to that of a sol-gel-prepared binary Ti0.6Ru0.40O2 coating. The activity of the ternary coating was similar to that of the binary Ti0.6Ru0.4O2 coating in the investigated solutions. However, the stability in seawater is found to be considerably greater for the ternary coating.									19	0	0	0	1	3	19			0352-5139			WOS:000252412100023

The development of highly efficient catalysts is the key to achieving cost-effective and large-scale production of hydrogen. Recently, P-containing catalysts have gained a great deal of attention owing to their diverse chemical valence states, tunable structure and unique physicochemical properties. In this review, an overview of up-to-date progress in water splitting of P-containing photo- and electro-catalysts including elemental P, transition metal phosphides, metal phosphates/phosphonates and metal phosphorus trichalcogenides is provided. A general introduction to the water splitting mechanism and the activity origin of P-containing catalysts is briefly presented to provide rational guidance for the design of highly efficient catalysts. Notably, innovational strategies to design P-containing catalysts with enhanced catalytic activity are summarized with respect to modifying the phase, introducing foreign elements, tailoring morphology and engineering interfaces. In each section, we aim to deeply clarify the theory-structure-property relationship and provide underlying reasons behind enhanced catalytic performance. Finally, some challenges and research orientations of P-containing catalysts toward water splitting are briefly proposed from the perspectives of practical application and mechanism investigation.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000739543000001

Structure evolution and/or allotropic transformation occurred during the annealing process. A very thin well-defined SiO2 layer was also formed at the HfO2-Si interface as a result of annealing. The HfO2/SiO2 film showed a high dielectric constant, very low leakage current, extremely high dielectric strength, low dielectric loss, well-behaved capacitance-voltage characteristics and good stability, making it a viable candidate for applications in very-large-scale and ultralarge-scale integration circuits.									62	2	0	0	1	0	66			0040-6090			WOS:A1992HY24700018

In this study, instead of feeding reactive gas, the impacts of co-feeding ethanol or glycol on the pyrolysis of cellulose were investigated at varied pyrolysis temperatures (400 and 600 degrees C). The results showed that the co-feeding of the alcohols affected yields of bio-char and tar, evolution of light organics and heavy organics, elemental composition, formation of fused ring structures, crystallinity, thermal stability, distribution of functionalities in the bio-char. The co-feeding of both glycol and ethanol enhanced the formation of the heavy components with the is-conjugated ring structures and affected the production of the light organics such as furfural and glycolaldehyde. Glycol or its derivatives cross-polymerized with the organics in bio-char, increasing bio-char yield and made the bio-char more oxygen-rich. Ethanol, however, showed the converse effects. Co-feeding of the alcohols promoted crystallinity but showed distinct effects on thermal stability of the bio-char at the varied pyrolysis temperatures. Both pyrolysis temperature and structures of the alcohols determined their extents of involvement in the pyrolysis of cellulose. (C) 2020 Energy Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we synthesized a binder-free thin film of ultrathin sheets of bimetallic Cu-Fe-based metal-organic frameworks (Cu/Fe-MOFs) on a nickel foam via a drop-casting route. In addition to the scalable route, the drop-casted film-electrode demonstrates the lower UOR potentials of 1.59, 1.58, 1.54, 1.51, 1.43 and 1.37 V vs. RHE to achieve the current densities of 2500, 2000, 1000, 500, 100 and 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. These UOR potentials are relatively lower than that acquired by the pristine Fe-MOF-based film-electrode synthesized via a similar route. For example, at 1.59 V vs. RHE, the Cu/Fe-MOF electrode exhibits a remarkably ultra-high anodic current density of 2500 mA cm(-2), while the pristine Fe-MOF electrode exhibits only 949.10 mA cm(-2). It is worth noting that the Cu/Fe-MOF electrode at this potential exhibits an OER current density of only 725 mA cm(-2), which is far inconsequential as compared to the UOR current densities, implying the profound impact of the bimetallic cores of the MOFs on catalyzing UOR. In addition, the Cu/Fe-MOF electrode also exhibits a long-term electrochemical robustness during UOR.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2079-4991		WOS:000809083900001	35683771

Journal of colloid and interface science				629	Pt B			111	120		10.1016/j.jcis.2022.09.069				2022-Sep-16	2022	Developing high-activity, long-durability, and noble metal-free oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution (HER) cocatalysts are the bottlenecks for efficient overall water splitting (OWS). Here, novel cobalt vanadium oxides doped by nitrogen were synthesized by nitriding Co2V2O7@NF precursor at 300-450°C for OER and HER reactions. N-Co2V2O7@NF (350°C) and N-Co2VO4/VO2@NF (400°C) show remarkable OER and HER performance with overpotentials of 310mV and 224mV at high current density (100mAcm-2). Besides, they also revealed long-term solid stability even after 170 h and 700h of continuous performance. Furthermore, the N-Co2V2O7@NF(+)||N-Co2VO4/VO2@NF(-) OWS device possesses a cell voltage of 1.93V at 500mAcm-2 better than RuO2@NF(+)||Pt/C@NF(-) (2.02V) and can operate for 60h with almost no degradation. This extraordinary performance can be attributed to the nanosheet structure, which can maximize the exposure of active sites and accelerate the mass transfer. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that N-doping can fine-tune the d-band center and band gap to facilitate intermediate adsorption and electron motion. The method presented here can be applied in other novel N-doped electrocatalysts for the energy field.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1095-7103		MEDLINE:36152569	36152569

The exposure to 300 degrees C reduced 21-25% the weight of samples without affecting the structure and strength (similar to 50 MPa) of formulations with high LS/MK, and/or low Na2O/Al2O3. The exposure to 600 degrees C extended the reactions/dissolution of MK while 1-17% of the N-A-S-H/N-(C)-A-S-H was depolymerized due to a water attack on the stretched Si-O-T bonds, with bridging oxygens transformed into non-bridging oxygen, while limestone favored the formation of C-(A)-S-H; the residual strength was of 30 MPa. The exposure to 900 degrees C led to the formation of nepheline and decarbonization of the CaCO3, which significantly reduced the strength to residual values of up to 20 MPa. These findings bring new insights on the performance of the AAC-LSMK and the thermally induced structural changes, while highlighting their potential high-temperature applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0958-9465	1873-393X		WOS:000679319900001

Therefore, green hydrogen production via water electrolysis has been touted as a practical solution for large scale energy storage. To further secure an environmentally sustainable future the deployment of electric vehicles and energy generation/storage devices will need to continue. This puts a high demand on scarce resources such as expensive platinum group metals which also results in an emerging waste problem at the end of life of these technologies. However, this provides an opportunity to take advantage of a major metal containing waste stream for urban mining which could relieve the pressure on natural resources and reduce both material and energy consumption. In this review it is outlined that there is an emerging application for this waste, i.e. electrocatalyst fabrication for use in water electrolysis to produce green hydrogen. It is identified that not only are battery materials suitable, but other sources of metal waste such as mass produced materials like stainless steel and refined minerals can be repurposed. Therefore, recycling such waste streams not only relieves the stress on mining ever more scarce elements but presents an opportunity to develop cost effective catalysts for green hydrogen production.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000862297500001

Seeds of the common sunflower contain the 14-residue, backbone-macrocyclic peptide sunflower trypsin inhibitor 1 (SFTI-1) whose maturation from its precursor has a genetic requirement for asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP). To provide more direct evidence, we developed an in situ assay and used O-18-water to demonstrate that SFTI-1 is excised and simultaneously macrocyclized from its linear precursor. The reaction is inefficient in situ, but a newfound breakdown pathway can mask this inefficiency by reducing the internal disulfide bridge of any acyclic-SFTI to thiols before degrading it. To confirm AEP can directly perform the excision/ligation, we produced several recombinant plant AEPs in E. coli, and one from jack bean could catalyze both a typical cleavage reaction and cleavage-dependent, intramolecular transpeptidation to create SFTI-1. We propose that the evolution of ligating endoproteases enables plants like sunflower and jack bean to stabilize bioactive peptides.									64	2	0	0	45	0	65			1074-5521	1879-1301		WOS:000355153900005	25960260

Using a technique not previously applied to the low-temperature kinetics of either interstellar or solar-system ice analogs, we estimate an activation energy of 32 kJ mol(-1) for HSO4- formation. These results show that at the temperatures of the Jovian satellites, SO2 and O-3 will efficiently react making detection of these molecules in the same vicinity unlikely. Our results also explain why O-3 has not been detected on Callisto and why the SO2 concentration on Callisto appears to be highest on that world's leading hemisphere. Furthermore, our results predict that the SO2 concentration on Ganymede will be lowest in the trailing hemisphere, where the concentration of O-3 is the highest. Our work suggests that thermal reactions in ices play a much more important role in surface and sub-surface chemistry than generally appreciated, possibly explaining the low abundance of sulfur-containing molecules and the lack of ozone observed in comets and interstellar ices.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2041-8205	2041-8213		WOS:000390345300001

In this study, we report ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles uniformly dispersed on N, C modified mesoporous TiO2 (N-TiO2/C) composites with enhanced interfacial interaction for the electrocatalytic HER. The N, C modified TiO2 can make Ru easier to be oxidized compared to non-modified TiO2. Consequently, the interaction can be tailored through the electron transfer from Ru to N, C modified mesoporous TiO2. The obtained Ru@N-TiO2/C catalysts exhibit excellent HER performance over a wide pH range, especially in 1 M KOH with a low overpotential of 39 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 47 mV dec(-1) even surpassing that of Pt/C. Meanwhile, the Ru@N-TiO2/C catalysts also possess low overpotentials of only 82 mV and 116 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M PBS and 0.5 M H2SO4, which are comparable to that of Pt/C. This work provides a new perspective for tailoring the interaction between the metal and support for enhancing electro-catalytic properties.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000872412100001

In recent times, an enormous amount of research effort has gone into using CPMs as sacrificial templates to fabricate electrochemically functional materials. The inherently electrochemically active sites inside CPMs are notably abundant and being explored with respect to electrochemical reactions. In this review, electrochemically active sites and the space around them (metal ions, ligands, crystal structures, pores, and morphologies) inside CPMs are the focus and recent progress in the fields of metal-ion batteries, metal-air batteries, water splitting, and other related electrochemical devices has been summarized. Overall, this review provides guidance on the preparation of electroactive CPMs via rational design and modulation of active sites such as redox-active metal clusters and organic ligands, and the space around the electrochemically active sites, and their applications in electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems.									149	12	0	0	6	0	153			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000530353200003	32154522

The fresh silicic glasses have low delta O-18 isotope values between 5.6 parts per thousand and 5.1 parts per thousand whereas basaltic glasses from the same ridge section have normal MORB delta O-18 values. Additionally, two FeTi basaltic and all silicic glasses have high Cl (up to 1.1 wt.%) and K2O (up to 1.6 wt.%) contents, indicating assimilation of hydrothermally altered material. Modelling suggests that the fractionating magma assimilated up to 30% of hydrothermally altered material after 57% fractional crystallisation of the basaltic magma in a melt lens at less than 2 km depth. In contrast, the basaltic glasses show little assimilation and clinopyroxene-melt barometry indicates crystal fractionation in deeper melt sills. Relatively low H2O/Ce and Li/Ce ratios as well as the low delta O-18 values and high Cl and K concentrations in the silicic glasses suggest assimilation of altered crustal rock rather than a brine. While some of the variability in highly incompatible element ratios is best explained by crystal fractionation processes of FeTi-oxides (e.g., decreasing Nb/U) others require a reaction of the melt with residual amphibole and clinopyroxene (Cl/K, Tb/Yb, Hf/Sm, Ce/Yb). The initial onset of FeTi oxide crystallisation is associated with a reduced oxygen fugacity causing sulphide saturation and significant loss of S, Cu, and Co from the evolved melts. This change to more reducing melts as a result of oxide crystallisation is supported by the strong development of a negative Eu anomaly in the andesites and dacites indicating stronger partitioning of Eu into plagioclase. Reverse mineral zoning in the evolved lavas also indicates that replenishment by mafic melts occurs in the shallow melt lens. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	Yang, Junfeng; Su, He; Dong, Yanhui; Fu, Yunhao; Guo, Xingyuan; Sun, Hang; Yin, Shengyan				Yin, Shengyan/H-4549-2012				Soluble polyfluorene dots as photocatalyst for light-driven methylene blue degradation and hydrogen generation								NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY				45	3			1423	1429		10.1039/d0nj05037g				JAN 21 2021	2021	Recently, polymer dots (Pdots) possessing conjugated structures have attracted the attention of researchers for use as photocatalysts for H-2 evolution reactions. Herein, soluble Pdots (ca. 30 nm) based on the semiconducting polymer poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (PFO) were introduced as a photocatalyst for photodegradation activity and light-driven hydrogen generation by a nanoprecipitation method. A photodegradation activity study of these Pdots (PFO-Pdots) with methylene blue (MB) showed a good ability to degrade MB in aqueous solution under simulated light. Moreover, the PFO-Pdots exhibited a good H-2 production rate up to 1.20 +/- 0.04 mmol h(-1) g(-1) without platinum or rhodium as a cocatalyst. According to the I-V curves and transient photocurrent response study, it was obvious that a significant photocurrent of the PFO-Pdots was generated under light irradiation. The low recombination rate of the photogenerated carriers and shortened charge diffusion path led to a good photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate. These phenomena suggested that the conjugated Pdots only composed of C, H, and O elements had good photocatalytic activity, and it was a powerful supplement to existing polymer photocatalytic systems. Moreover, PFO-Pdots had better photocatalytic activity in water than pure PFO. This study shows that PFO-Pdots or conjugated Pdots may be promising candidates in the field of photocatalysis in the future.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000611678100031

The Journal of biological chemistry				295	16			5377	5389		10.1074/jbc.REV119.007741				2020-Apr-17	2020	Aldehyde oxidases (AOXs) are a small group of enzymes belonging to the larger family of molybdo-flavoenzymes, along with the well-characterized xanthine oxidoreductase. The two major types of reactions that are catalyzed by AOXs are the hydroxylation of heterocycles and the oxidation of aldehydes to their corresponding carboxylic acids. Different animal species have different complements of AOX genes. The two extremes are represented in humans and rodents; whereas the human genome contains a single active gene (AOX1), those of rodents, such as mice, are endowed with four genes (Aox1-4), clustering on the same chromosome, each encoding a functionally distinct AOX enzyme. It still remains enigmatic why some species have numerous AOX enzymes, whereas others harbor only one functional enzyme. At present, little is known about the physiological relevance of AOX enzymes in humans and their additional forms in other mammals. These enzymes are expressed in the liver and play an important role in the metabolisms of drugs and other xenobiotics. In this review, we discuss the expression, tissue-specific roles, and substrate specificities of the different mammalian AOX enzymes and highlight insights into their physiological roles.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1083-351X		MEDLINE:33509581	33509581

During this phase the progenitor CO WD can burn a small fraction of its carbon hydrostatically, releasing energy and ashes that make the star convective and able to capture electrons from the degenerate plasma. In this work we present simplified pre-supernova evolution models of CO WDs growing towards the Chandrasekhar mass accreting matter stably and evolving through the simmering phase towards ignition in order to explore the effects of different initial masses and cooling times in the final chemical composition of the WD before explosion. Preliminary results show that, as expected, denser systems at the start of the simmering phase undergo stronger neutronization. The amount of neutronization is less than what is found in the one-zone models of Chamulak et al. (2008), about a third, and can vary by about a factor of two depending on the exact path to explosion.					281st Symposium of the International-Astronomical-Union281st Symposium of the International-Astronomical-Union	JUL 04-08, 2011JUL 04-08, 2011	INAF; City Padova; Univ Padova, Dept Astronomy; INAF Padova Observ; ANEMOSINAF; City Padova; Univ Padova, Dept Astronomy; INAF Padova Observ; ANEMOS	Padova, ITALYPadova, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1743-9213	1743-9221	978-1-107-01981-2	WOS:000316706100067

The as-prepared Ni foam substrate exhibits homogeneous and porous nanowire arrays, which providing a number of active sites and electronic transmission channels for urea electrooxidation. The electroactivity of NiCo2O4/NF electrode toward the oxidation of urea in alkaline solution is evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Results show that the as-obtained electrode delivers an outstanding electrocatalytic activity and stability for urea electrooxidation. The NiCo2O4/NF electrode delivers a low open potential at 0.19 V versus Ag/AgCl with a corresponding current density of 570 mA cm(-2) in 5 mol L-1 KOH and 0.33 mol L-1 urea electrolytes. Meanwhile, detailed investigation is made for the electrocatalytic oxidation of urea by varying several reaction parameters, such as scan rate, urea and KOH concentrations. Benefiting from the unique structure and synergistic effects of Ni and Co, the NiCo2O4/NF electrode exhibit superior electrocatalyst activity and is considered to be a promising candidate catalysis material for direct urea fuel cell.									59	4	0	0	2	0	59			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000456762100029

Stochastic methods for aerosol chemistry: a compact molecular description of functionalization and fragmentation in the heterogeneous oxidation of squalane aerosol by OH radicals								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				17	6			4398	4411		10.1039/c4cp04927f				2015	2015	The heterogeneous oxidation of organic aerosol by hydroxyl radicals (OH) can proceed through two general pathways: functionalization, in which oxygen functional groups are added to the carbon skeleton, and fragmentation, in which carbon-carbon bonds are broken, producing higher volatility, lower molecular weight products. An ongoing challenge is to develop a quantitative molecular description of these pathways that connects the oxidative evolution of the average aerosol properties (e.g. size and hygroscopicity) to the transformation of free radical intermediates. In order to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism of aerosol oxidation, a relatively compact kinetics model is developed for the heterogeneous oxidation of squalane particles by OH using free radical intermediates that convert reactive hydrogen sites into oxygen functional groups. Stochastic simulation techniques are used to compare calculated system properties over ten oxidation lifetimes with the same properties measured in experiment. The time-dependent average squalane aerosol mass, volume, density, carbon number distribution of scission products, and the average elemental composition are predicted using known rate coefficients. For functionalization, the calculations reveal that the distribution of alcohol and carbonyl groups is controlled primarily by the initial OH abstraction rate and to lesser extent by the branching ratio between secondary peroxy radical product channels. For fragmentation, the calculations reveal that the formation of activated alkoxy radicals with neighboring functional groups controls the molecular decomposition, particularly at high O/C ratios. This kinetic scheme provides a framework for understanding the oxidation chemistry of a model organic aerosol and informs parameterizations of more complex systems.									34	0	0	0	6	0	33			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000349005900050	25578323

Exploring new candidates for further improving the performances of nickel-based catalysts and understanding the structure-activity relationship are still necessary to reduce the overpotential of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) thus advancing their application in electrochemical water splitting. Herein, we developed a facile two-step self-templated strategy for fabricating a three-dimensional (3D) nanoporous nickel/vanadium oxide (Ni/V2O3) nanoplate assembly as a new efficient catalyst for alkaline HER. It is found that by controllably annealing the Ni-V-O assembly as a single precursor, Ni and V2O3 components are uniformly integrated in the nanoporous composite, showing a synergistically enhancing effect on the HER. The resulting 3D nanoporous structure not only creates numerous active sites accessible for the HER but also provides a conductive open network towards efficient electron/mass transport. Consequently, the nanoporous Ni/V2O3 nanoplate assembly exhibits excellent catalytic performance for alkaline HER in terms of a low overpotential of 61 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 79.7 mV dec(-1) together with excellent long-term durability. These findings provide new insights into good design and construction of other highly active catalysts for diverse applications.									25	3	0	0	1	0	26			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000449701900023

The current paper is a study on the investigation of electrocatalytic properties of Ni-Mo-oxides in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by water electrolysis in the acidic, alkaline, and neutral electrolytes. The Ni-Mo-oxides of several compositions were formed on a titanium substrate employing a thermal-decomposition method. The morphology of the obtained coatings was investigated by scanning electron microscopy, and their crystallinity by X-ray diffraction. Linear Tafel polarization and chronoamperometry were used to determine the extrinsic and intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of the coatings (cathodes) in the HER. The most extrinsically active coating was found to be Ni0.6Mo0.8-oxide (in all three electrolytes), while this coating showed the highest intrinsic activity only in the neutral electrolyte. In the acidic and alkaline electrolyte, the Ni0.8Mo0.2-oxide coating was found to be most intrinsically active. In the alkaline electrolyte, the Ni0.8Mo0.2-oxide cathode had twice the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of the current state-of-the- art, pure nickel. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Agglomeration of Au clusters deposited onto semiconductor surfaces into larger particles is a major challenge. Metal oxide overlayers can be used to improve the stability of Au clusters on surfaces and avoid their agglomeration. The aim of this work is to investigate the inhibition of phosphine-protected Au-9 clusters beneath a Cr(OH)(3) overlayer to agglomerate under conditions of photocatalytic water splitting (i.e. UV irradiation). Au-9 was deposited on the surface of SrTiO3 using a solution impregnation method followed by photodeposition of a Cr(OH)(3) layer. After UV light irradiation for 7 hours for photocatalytic water splitting, uncovered Au clusters on SrTiO3 agglomerated into larger particles. However, agglomeration was inhibited when a thin Cr(OH)(3) layer was deposited onto the SrTiO3-Au-9 system. From careful XPS measurements, the chemical state of the overlayer is initially determined to be Cr(OH)(3) but upon heating at 200 degrees C for 10 min it converts to Cr2O3. Through photocatalysis experiments it was found that the Cr(OH)(3) overlayer blocks the sites for O evolution reaction on the SrTiO3-Au-9.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2633-5409		WOS:000772919900001

Despite recent advances in the synthesis of transition metal selenide nanostructures, the fabrication of porous nanosheet based binder-free electrode with more active sites remains a major challenge. Herein, the self-templating construction of a porous CoSe2 nanosheet array on carbon cloth (p-CoSe2/CC) has been reported by vapor selenizing the preprepared alpha-Co(OH)(2) nanosheet array precursor. Arising from large active surface area, fast diffusion of generated gas and strong structural stability, the as obtained p-CoSe2/CC can serve as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for both OER and HER in alkaline electrolyte, with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of 243 mV for OER and 138 mV for HER, respectively. Moreover, when p-CoSe2/CC is assembled as an alkaline electrolyzor, it only needs a cell voltage of 1.62 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and shows excellent long-term stability of 20 h. The versatile fabrication strategy with self-templated porous structure proves a new way to construct other advanced metal selenide for energy conversion and storage.									54	3	0	0	3	0	55			2168-0485			WOS:000449577200192

The use of homogeneous catalysts is advantageous in the elucidation of detailed catalytic mechanisms including the detection of active intermediates for water oxidation. In contrast, heterogeneous catalysts are advantageous for practical applications, because of their high catalytic activity and the ease with which they can be separated by filtration. However, it is quite difficult to identify the active intermediates on the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts, and therefore, the heterogeneous catalytic mechanism of water oxidation has not been clarified. Although investigations on homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts for water oxidation have been performed rather independently, the link between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts is becoming more important for the development of efficient WOCs. This microreview focuses on factors to determine if the actual catalysts for water oxidation are homogeneous or heterogeneous depending on the conditions under which the catalysts are used. Ligand oxidation of homogeneous catalysts sometimes results in dissociation of the ligands to form nanoparticles, which act as much more efficient catalysts for water oxidation.									101	0	0	0	7	0	102			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000336741600008

The new framework has been extensively verified by both temporal evolution and spatial distribution of several key species and gas temperature. Simulation results show that it accelerates the total CPU time by 3.16 times, accelerates the calculation of kinetics by 80 times, and accelerates the calculation of transport properties by 836 times.

Since native biotin synthesis does not always suffice for fast growth and product formation, microbial cultivation in research and industry often requires supplementation of biotin. De novo biotin biosynthesis in yeasts is not fully understood, which hinders attempts to optimize the pathway in these industrially relevant microorganisms. Previous work based on laboratory evolution of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for biotin prototrophy identified Bio1, whose catalytic function remains unresolved, as a bottleneck in biotin synthesis. This study aimed at eliminating this bottleneck in the S. cerevisiae laboratory strain CEN.PK113-7D. A screening of 35 Saccharomycotina yeasts identified six species that grew fast without biotin supplementation. Overexpression of the S. cerevisiae BIO1 (ScBIO1) ortholog isolated from one of these biotin prototrophs, Cyberlindnera fabianii, enabled fast growth of strain CEN.PK113-7D in biotin-free medium. Similar results were obtained by single overexpression of C. fabianii BIO1 (CfBIO1) in other laboratory and industrial S. cerevisiae strains. However, biotin prototrophy was restricted to aerobic conditions, probably reflecting the involvement of oxygen in the reaction catalyzed by the putative oxidoreductase CfBio1. In aerobic cultures on biotin-free medium, S. cerevisiae strains expressing CfBio1 showed a decreased susceptibility to contamination by biotin-auxotrophic S. cerevisiae. This study illustrates how the vast Saccharomycotina genomic resources may be used to improve physiological characteristics of industrially relevant S. cerevisiae.IMPORTANCE The reported metabolic engineering strategy to enable optimal growth in the absence of biotin is of direct relevance for large-scale industrial applications of S. cerevisiae. Important benefits of biotin prototrophy include cost reduction during the preparation of chemically defined industrial growth media as well as a lower susceptibility of biotin-prototrophic strains to contamination by auxotrophic microorganisms. The observed oxygen dependency of biotin synthesis by the engineered strains is relevant for further studies on the elucidation of fungal biotin biosynthesis pathways.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0099-2240	1098-5336		WOS:000540906600002	32276977

It is, therefore, of great significance to explore alternate non-noble-metal co-catalysts. Herein, a novel non-precious metal Mn2Co2C@C/Mn(2)N(0.86)composite (denoted as MCMN), composed of Mn(2)N(0.86)and N-doped graphitized carbon wrapped Mn2Co2C nanoparticles, was fabricated and then used to modify photocatalysts, such as g-C(3)N(4)and SrTiO(3)for the construction of MCMN/g-C(3)N(4)and MCMN/SrTiO(3)composite photocatalysts by a mechanical grinding method. When they were used for PC OWS under UV-Vis light irradiation, in the initial stage, the Mn(2)N(0.86)in MCMN was hydrolyzed, and novel non-precious metal MnOOH and Mn2Co2C@C (MC) dual cocatalysts were photo-derived to growin situon the surfaces of photocatalysts. In the new kind of MC/g-C3N4/MnOOH PC system, the metallic MC acts as a co-catalyst for H(2)generation, effectively trapping photoelectrons and accelerating H(2)evolution reaction; meanwhile, MnOOH acts as a co-catalyst for O(2)generation, favoring the adsorption of water molecules on the surface to boost the O(2)evolution reaction. Consequently, the optimized MC/g-C3N4/MnOOH showed a prominent H(2)evolution rate of 8.876 mu mol h(-1)for PC OWS, even higher than that of g-C(3)N(4)loaded with 1 wt% Pt, and the corresponding AQE reached 2.54% and 1.45% at 400 and 420 nm, respectively. A similar promotion was also obtained on the SrTiO(3)photocatalyst, demonstrating the versatility of this composite. This work provides a new avenue for the construction of novel noble-metal-free PC systems.									12	2	0	0	1	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000562931300030

Five OA components are identified using positive matrix factorization including hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA) and two types of oxygenated OA (OOA). The Pasadena OA elemental composition when plotted as H:C versus O:C follows a line less steep than that observed for Riverside, CA. The OOA components from both locations follow a common line, however, indicating similar secondary organic aerosol (SOA) oxidation chemistry at the two sites such as fragmentation reactions leading to acid formation. In addition to the similar evolution of elemental composition, the dependence of SOA concentration on photochemical age displays quantitatively the same trends across several North American urban sites. First, the OA/CO values for Pasadena increase with photochemical age exhibiting a slope identical to or slightly higher than those for Mexico City and the northeastern United States. Second, the ratios of OOA to odd-oxygen (a photochemical oxidation marker) for Pasadena, Mexico City, and Riverside are similar, suggesting a proportional relationship between SOA and odd-oxygen formation rates. Weekly cycles of the OA components are examined as well. HOA exhibits lower concentrations on Sundays versus weekdays, and the decrease in HOA matches that predicted for primary vehicle emissions using fuel sales data, traffic counts, and vehicle emission ratios. OOA does not display a weekly cycleafter accounting for differences in photochemical aging which suggests the dominance of gasoline emissions in SOA formation under the assumption that most urban SOA precursors are from motor vehicles.									185	6	0	0	63	1	189			2169-897X	2169-8996		WOS:000324933900034

Cubic symmetry (Fm $($) over bar$$ 3m) was observed for Ba-2(A(x)Bi(2-x))O-6-x/2 (A = Sr2+, Ca2+) compounds, except for Ba2Sr1/3Bi5/3O5.83 compositions where the structure crystallizes with monoclinic symmetry (I2/m). Creation of oxygen vacancies contributing towards a gradual contraction of the unit cell, are competing with Ca2+ or Sr2+ substitutions regarded as the partial replacement of Bi3+ leading to an increase of the unit-cell. The XRD patterns of the Ba-2(RuxBi2-x)O-6 (x = 1/2, 2/3) pseudo-cubic solid solutions are indexed using a body-centered monoclinic cell (I2/m), the unit cell volume decreasing as the Ru content increases. X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements of Bi L(III) near edge structure and EXAFS oscillations have revealed evidence of mixed valencies in these compounds and have given complementary and new information about the environment of bismuth which can be five or six-fold coordinated to oxygen atoms. The Bi L(III) edges exhibit a continuous evolution with increasing Ca or Sr doping level or with lowering Ru doping. The Bi L(III) edges are dominated by two main features due to 2p(3/2) --> 6d and 2p(3/2) --> 6s transtions due to the unfilled 6s states of Bi5+ only. Such a feature which is indicative of the absence of the lone pair allows an unambiguous determination of the highest valence states of these elements and to discriminate between Bi3+ and Bi5+. Detailed analysis of XAFS reveals that with increasing Ca or Sr doping, or with lowering Ru doping, the average Bi-O distance decreases continuously, in good agreement with XANES and XRD analysis.					1st European Conference on Synchrotron Radiation in Materials Science1st European Conference on Synchrotron Radiation in Materials Science	JUL 03-08, 1994JUL 03-08, 1994	CEA Aktiebolag, Stringnis, Sweden; Daresbury Rutherford Appleton Lab, Daresbury, UK; EG&G Ortec, Oakridge, USA; Elsevier Sci BV, Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Engn & Phys Sci Res Council, Swindon, UK European Union, Brussels, Belgium; ICI Chem & Polym, Runcorn, UK; Pilkington Technol Management Ltd, Ormskirk, UK; Princeton Instruments, Trenton, USA; Siemens, Karlsruhe, Germany; Spectrolab Res Labs Ltd, Newbury, UK; Unilever Res, Wirral, UK; VCH Publ, Cambridge, UKCEA Aktiebolag, Stringnis, Sweden; Daresbury Rutherford Appleton Lab, Daresbury, UK; EG&G Ortec, Oakridge, USA; Elsevier Sci BV, Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Engn & Phys Sci Res Council, Swindon, UK European Union, Brussels, Belgium; ICI Chem & Polym, Runcorn, UK; Pilkington Technol Management Ltd, Ormskirk, UK; Princeton Instruments, Trenton, USA; Siemens, Karlsruhe, Germany; Spectrolab Res Labs Ltd, Newbury, UK; Unilever Res, Wirral, UK; VCH Publ, Cambridge, UK	CHESTER, ENGLANDCHESTER, ENGLAND	12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0168-583X			WOS:A1995RF15800018

A modification of electrolyte composition is suggested in the presented paper for better corrosion inhibition and enhancement of the stability of the sulfuric acid-based electrolyte during charging process. Ten quaternary ammonium-based ionic liquids have been employed as additives to electrolyte. The differences between used compounds have been based on different types of anion in the molecule (sulfate and bisulfate) and the length of the substituent incorporated in the cation. The electrochemical window of the electrolyte in terms of onset potentials of hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, corrosion potential, corrosion current density and polarization resistance of the alloy in case of corrosion have been the parameters evaluated based on the undertaken experiments. It has been noted that the length of the side chain in the molecule has a great impact on the final properties of ionic liquids. Experiments have shown that hexadecyltrimethylammonium-based ionic liquids contributed to the most visible improvement in comparison to the other compounds. Significance of the anion in the molecule has been also observed, bisulfate anion appeared to be beneficial for the overall performance of the lead-calcium-tin alloy electrode.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1452-3981			WOS:000452568200079

The as synthesized nanocomposites were characterized using XRD (X-ray diffraction), FESEM (Field emission scanning electron microscopy), TEM (Transmission electron microscopy), XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) and BET (Surface Area and Porosity System). The observations showed uniform alpha-Fe2O3 nanorods approximately 100-200 nm in length and 50-100 nm in diameter that were hierarchically assembled onto the surface of the MWCNTs. The formation of the heterostructure was investigated by observing the evolution of the microstructure of the products at different reaction times. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) showed that the ability of the absorbing oxygen was enhanced by the formation of the heterostructure composites. Moreover, as a proof -of -concept presentation, the novel CNTs@alpha-Fe2O3 hierarchical heterostructure acted as a gas sensitive material. Significantly, the composites exhibited excellent sensing properties for acetone with high sensitivity, exceptional selectivity and good reproducibility. The response of the CNTs@alpha-Fe2O3 sensor to 100 ppm acetones at 225 degrees C was nearly 35, which was superior to the single alpha-Fe2O3 nanorods with a response of 16, and the detection limit of the sensor was 500 ppb. The enhanced properties were mainly attributed to the unique structure and p-n heterojunction between the CNTs and the alpha-Fe2O3 nanorods.									83	3	0	0	4	0	84			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000396801200054	28234460

In this area, very dilute and acidic CO2-rich waters [62-242 mg l(-1) in total dissolved solid (TDS), 4.0-5.3 in pH; group I) occur together with normal CO2-rich waters (317-988 mg l(-1) in TDS, 5.5-6.0 in pH; group II). The concentration levels and ages of group I water are similar to those of recently recharged and low-mineralized groundwater (group III). Calculation of reaction pathways suggests that group I waters are produced by direct influx of CO2 gas into group III type waters. When the groundwater is injected with CO2, it develops the capacity to accept dissolved solids and it can evolve into water with very high solute concentrations. Whether the water is open or closed to the CO2 gases becomes less important in controlling the reaction pathway of the CO2-rich groundwater when the initial pCO(2) is high. Our data show that most of the solutes are dissolved in the CO2-rich groundwater at pH > 5 where the weathering rates of silicates are very slow or independent of pH. Thus, groundwater age is likely more important in developing high solute concentrations in the CO2-rich groundwaters than accelerated weathering kinetics because of acidic pH caused by high pCO(2).					15th Hubbert Quorum15th Hubbert Quorum	DEC09, 2007DEC09, 2007		San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA	22	0	0	0	10	0	23			1468-8115	1468-8123		WOS:000252496000002

However, their photooxidation performance is generally weakened when suffering from the competitive adsorption of H2O. In a method inspired by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to generate intermediates with hydroxyl radicals on the anode electrode catalysts, an electric field was employed in this research and applied to the photooxidation of CHOH to prevent the competitive adsorption of H2O. Additionally, 0.5-5% Fe2O3 decorated TiO2 was employed to improve the photoelectrocatalytic activity. The influence of an electric field on hydroxyl-radical production was investigated by both density functional theory (DFT) with direct-imposed dipole momentum and photoelectrocatalytic experimental tests. The surface characterization of the photocatalysts, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), was conducted. DFT results show that a positive electric field with a strength of 0.05 angstrom/V was more favorable to produce hydroxyl on Fe2O3/TiO2(010) than was a negative electric field. Fe2O3 decoration can significantly boost hydroxyl formation, resulting from a decrease in the binding energy between the Fe of Fe2O3 and the oxygen and hydrogen atoms of H2O. The dissociated hydrogen atom of the H2O preferentially remained on the catalysts' surface rather than being released into the gas flow. The experimental results demonstrated that applying 150 V could not directly enhance the photooxidation of CHOH by either TiO2 or Fe2O3/TiO2 but that it could relieve the H2O inhibitory effect by more than 10% on the Fe2O3/TiO2.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0944-1344	1614-7499		WOS:000702635000015	34599445

Transition-metal phosphides (TMPs) have been known as one of the most promising candidates for the efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to their favorable intrinsic reactivity. However, structural engineering related to the gas bubbles evolution and tiny regulation of components concerned with the electronic structure remained as a significant challenge that requires further optimization. Herein, the nanoarrays (NAs) composed of ultrasmall Co2P and CoP nanoparticle-embedded N-doped carbon matrix (Co2P&CoP@N-C) are prepared and demonstrated an overpotential of 62.8 +/- 4.7 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. The nanoarray-structured electrocatalyst revealed the superaerophobicity and facilitates the detachment of the in situ formed hydrogen gas bubbles, ensuring abundant catalytic sites and electrode-electrolyte interface for the mass transfer process. The amount of P doping modulated the local electron density around Co and P atoms, which attains a favorable compromise to afford sufficient electrons for the electrocatalysis and inhibit the negative influence of H-2 desorption. Significantly, the lowered overpotential induced by the electrocatalyst surface architecture is much stronger than that of the component content and promotes the electrocatalytic activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000751894800026	34787391

The model was successful in descriving ignition of individual composite particles in a CO2 laser beam. However, it was unable to conclusively predict ignition of the same powder particles coated onto an electrically heated filament. In this work, ignition of fully-dense 2A1.3CuO nanocomposite powder prepared by arrested reactive milling was studied using a modified electrically heated filament experiment, located in a miniature vacuum chamber. Thin layers of the powders coated on a nickel-chromium filament were ignited at heating rates between 200 and 16,000 K/s. The ignition was accompanied by both optical emission and pressure signals. The pressure signals occurred before emission, with increasing delay at higher heating rates. Ignition temperatures were only slightly affected by the heating rate. The results are interpreted proposing that the low-temperature red ox reaction produces a metastable CuO1-x phase with 0 < x Lt1 which releases oxygen upon heating. It is shown that despite a relatively small heat release, the low-temperature reactions in nanocomposite thermites are important as producing destabilized, partially reduced oxides that decompose with gas release upon heating. In the present experiments, the gas release changed thermal properties of the powder coating, reducing the efficiency of hear exchange with the supporting filament and thus enabling its thermal runaway and ignition.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			2150-766X			INSPEC:13960771

Herein, a nanosized Cu0.5Co2.5O4 catalyst synthesized by co-precipitation by adjusting pH is applied to the anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) cell as an anode, which is demonstrated to have higher efficiency and stability than noble metal-based anodes. The composition (Cu/Co) and morphology of Cu0.5Co2.5O4 change as the pH increases and then nanoparticles are formed at pH 11, where oxygen vacancies are formed by the etching of Cu. In the density functional theory study, the electronic structure of Co modified by Cu in the Co3O4 lattice leads to an optimal adsorption strength, resulting in a free energy diagram in which the potential of Cu0.5Co2.5O4 (1.756 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) is more thermodynamically favorable than that of Co3O4 (1.951 V vs. RHE). The Cu0.5Co2.5O4 catalyst has a recorded overpotential of 285 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. Furthermore, the AEMWE cell using Cu0.5Co2.5O4 as an anode exhibited a current density of 1.3 A cm(-2) at 1.8 V, which is the highest performance among the reported papers and maintains around 80% energy conversion efficiency for 100 hours.									33	1	0	0	0	0	33			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000519704200042

The samples were irradiated by 2 MeV fast electrons and the behavior of radiation-produced defects is studied by means of infrared (IR) spectroscopy, monitoring the relevant bands in spectra. Regarding the VOn family, it was found that the presence of Ge affects the annealing temperature of VO defects as well as their fraction that is converted to VO2 defects. Both effects are discussed in relation with an impact of Ge on the concentration of self-interstitials that take part in the annealing of VO defects via two reaction paths VO + I -> O-i and VO + O-i -> VO2. Furthermore, two bands at 1037 and 1051 cm(-1) are attributed to the VO5 defect, although three other bands at 762, 967 and 1005 cm(-1) are believed to be associated with VnOm clusters containing carbon, most likely having a VOnCs structure. Regarding carbon-related complexes, it has been established that the annealing of the 862 cm(-1) band belonging to the CiOi defect is accompanied by the emergence of the 1048 cm(-1) band previously assigned to the CsO2i center. The evolution of the CiCs and the CiOiI bands is monitored and the identification of bands at 947, 967 and 1020 cm(-1) making their appearance in IR spectra over the temperature range where CiCs and C(i)Q(i)I defects are annealed out is discussed.					14th International Biannual Meeting on Gettering and Defect Engineering in Semiconductor (GADEST2011)14th International Biannual Meeting on Gettering and Defect Engineering in Semiconductor (GADEST2011)	SEP 25-30, 2011SEP 25-30, 2011	Johannes Kepler Univ, Inst Halbleiter & Festkorperphysik; Gesellschaft Halbleiterphysik & Technol; Zentrum Interkulturelle Studien Furstenfeld; Blue Chip Energy BmbHJohannes Kepler Univ, Inst Halbleiter & Festkorperphysik; Gesellschaft Halbleiterphysik & Technol; Zentrum Interkulturelle Studien Furstenfeld; Blue Chip Energy BmbH	Loipersdorf Spa & Conf Ctr, Loipersdorf, AUSTRIALoipersdorf Spa & Conf Ctr, Loipersdorf, AUSTRIA	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1012-0394		*****************	WOS:000303356300022

In the recent past, structure of PS II has been the focus of research in plant science. The report of X-ray crystallographic structure of PS II complex by the research groups of James Barber and So Iwata in UK (K.N. Ferreira et al. Science 303: 1831-38, 2004) is a milestone in the area of research in photosynthesis. It follows the pioneering and elegant work from the laboratories of Horst Witt and W. Saenger in Germany (A. Zouni et al. Nature 409: 739-743, 2001), and J. Shen in Japan (N. Kamiya and J. Shen, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100: 98-103, 2003). It is time to analyze the historic events during the long journey made by the researchers to arrive at this point. This review makes an attempt to critically review the growth of the advancement of concepts and knowledge on the photosystem in the background of technological development. We conclude the review with perspectives on research and technology that should reveal the complete story of PS II of thylakoid in the future.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000231949800002	16170631

During stable operation with a Cd(II) concentration of 20 mg/L, the average removal efficiencies of Cd(II) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were more than 85% and that of total phosphorus was greater than 70%, while the total nitrogen (TN) was only about 45%. The protein (PN) content in the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) increased significantly after Cd(II) addition, while polysaccharides displayed a decreasing trend (p < 0.05), indicating that EPS prefer to release PN to adsorb Cd(11) and protect bacteria from damage. Three-dimensional fluorescence spectral analysis showed that fulvic acid-like substances were the most abundant chemical components of EPS. The addition of Cd(II) adversely affected most denitrifying bacteria (p < 0.05), which is consistent with the low TN removal. In addition, quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that CzcA gene abundance decreased as the Cd (II) concentration increased, possibly because expression of the CzcA gene was inhibited by Cd(II) stress. The majority of CzcA gene sequences were carried by Pseudomonas, making it the dominant genus among Cd(II)-resistant bacteria.									15	3	0	0	10	0	17			0301-4797	1095-8630		WOS:000497253000063	31514000

Considering that operation conditions can often lead to simultaneous and related changes in a catalysts speciation and shape, herein we introduce a setup that combines SAXS and XAS in a configuration that allows optimum acquisition and corresponding data quality for both techniques. To determine the reliability of this setup, the latter was used to study the operando degradation of two carbon-supported Pt-nanoparticle (Pt/C) catalysts customarily used in polymer electrolyte fuel cells. The model used for the fitting of the SAXS curves unveiled the fractal nature of the Pt/C-electrodes and their evolution during the operando tests, and both X-ray techniques were complemented with control, ex situ transmission electron microscopy, and standard electrochemical measurements. Ultimately, the results obtained with this combined setup quantitatively agree with those reported in previous studies, successfully validating this apparatus and highlighting its potential to study the operando changes undergone by worse-understood (electro)catalytic systems.									34	1	0	0	0	0	33			2155-5435			WOS:000441112400024

Photoluminescence was used as a tool to control in situ the passivation of III-V semiconductors. A study of the influence of several experi mental parameters revealed that substrate temperature, excitation intensity, and excitation time can all modify photoluminescence. Photoluminescence measurements as a function of excitation intensity were used to study the progressive evolution of the InP surface after several processing steps. The thermal stability of the InP surface, the effect of oxygen plasma treatments, and SiO2 deposition using an oxygen plasma were investigated. Correlations between photoluminescence intensity measured at a fixed intensity on as-grown structures and interfacial electrical properties of the final InP/SiO2 structures as characterized by 1 MHz capacitance-voltage measurements were established. The reported results clearly demonstrate that in situ PL can be used to monitor, with confidence, the interfacial electrical properties of InP/SiO2 structures during the fabrication process.					185th Meeting of the Electrochemical-Society185th Meeting of the Electrochemical-Society	MAY 22-27, 1994MAY 22-27, 1994	Electrochem SocElectrochem Soc	SAN FRANCISCO, CASAN FRANCISCO, CA	9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0013-4651			WOS:A1997XH82800048

Unfortunately, relatively little information about physiological variability within natural populations of organisms is available. In particular, to begin to understand how physiological traits evolve we need information on the extent of physiological variability related to the extent of genetic variability over a range of environmental conditions experienced by individual populations. Clonal organisms may be particularly well-suited to such studies because they provide an opportunity to use replicated genotypes (i.e., clonemates) in controlled experiments, We are using the cosmopolitan sea anemone Haliplanella lineata to explore physiological variance in natural populations. Growth, absorption and routine rates of oxygen uptake do not vary among three clones from a single population when measured at 15 degrees C, the approximate midpoint in the seasonal range of water temperatures experienced by this population. Broad-sense heritabilities for routine rates of oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion (0.14 and 0.09, respectively), indicate a relatively low fraction of variance in these physiological rates is attributable to genetic variation among fi ce clones in this population, Although some literature indicates that such low heritabilities may be expected when physiological traits are measured at environmental mid-range as opposed to extremes, other evidence indicates that it will be difficult to predict the trend between environmental stress and genetic variance in physiological performance.

The SF data provide means of checking the substrate morphology with respect to cracks formed during the drying process and with respect to aggregates from used binder of poly(fluoroethylene) (PTFE) simultaneously to the electrochemical data. Electron microscopy results show that a GDE prepared with smaller PTFE particles exhibits less PTFE aggregation and more regular cracks. The SECM images show a more homogeneous distribution and higher level of oxygen reduction reaction activity for the GDE prepared with smaller PTFE particles. The quantitative comparison is enabled by the SF setup that maintains a constant working distance toward the sample in the variant of the redox competition mode, in which a cyclic voltammogram was recorded for every grid position of the microelectrode probe. Mass transport limitations of oxygen during the experiment are avoided by dedicated shape of the microelectrode body. Images of microelectrode currents at specific potentials were extracted to map the local electrocatalytic activity of the GDE. The GDEs were processed to membrane electrode assemblies and applied in HT-PEFC single cell tests. The polarization curve agree with the SECM results that GDEs produced with smaller PTFE particles favor the MEA performance. (C) The Author(s) 2017. Published by ECS.

However, the effect of atomic configurations of different surfaces on HER is still lacking theoretical insights. In this work, the HER activity on 29 surfaces of seven phases is systematically explored by density functional theory, taking into account water effect. The exchange current for each surface is also given. Totally, there are nine surfaces which own high exchange current (>0.1 mA/cm(2)), especially the hydroxylated (014)-C and (010) of TiP-MoC, (110) of beta-Mo2C, and (100)-C of alpha-Mo2C (1.410, 0.835, 0.687, and 0.464 mA/cm(2), respectively). Combining with the stabilities of the surfaces for each phase, the phases with high HER activity could be also screened out. The electronic properties, including electron transfer to adsorbed hydrogen and the shift of the electronic states coupled by oxygen and adsorbed hydrogen orbitals, are applied to uncover the termination of surface and water effect on HER. Our results are expected to contribute to the understanding of the HER on different surfaces of molybdenum carbides and give some evidence for control synthesis of high HER activity surfaces.									14	1	0	0	0	0	13			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000486360900006

With the initial amount of gold oxide on the electrode surface being constant, linear dependences of j(p) on v, log j(c) on E and log j(p) on E-p were established. It has been found that the parameters dE/d log j(c), dE(p)/d log j(p) and dE(p)/d log v at 1.2 V (SHE) > E > E-p are close to the theoretical value of 2.3RT/F. Such Tafel behaviour is expected for the cathodic process in the case of a reversible metal\metal oxide electrode. It has been proposed that the reversibility of the cathodic process may be determined by the equilibrium of the following surface reaction:Au . H2O+ 2H2O double left right arrow (Au(OH)(3))(s) + 3H(+) + 3e(-)where Au . H2O represents the gold surface atoms with electrostatically adsorbed H2O, and (Au(OH)(3))(s) is Au(OH)(3) in the form of the surface layer. This equilibrium may exist at the interface only when the Au(OH), layer is present on the electrode surface. The equilibrium potential of this reaction was evaluated as 1.28 +/- 0.01 V.

In this work, a novel in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry is constructed to differentiate the speciation and source of each gas product generated either during cycling or during storage in the presence of cathode chemistries of varying structure and nickel contents. It unambiguously excludes the trace moisture in electrolyte as the major source of hydrogen and convincingly identifies the layer-structured NCM cathode material as the source of instability that releases active oxygen from the lattice at high voltages when NCM experiences H2 -> H3 phase transition, which in turn reacts with carbonate solvents, producing both CO2 and proton at the cathode side. Such proton in solvated state travels across the cell and becomes the main source for hydrogen generated at the anode side.

J	Li, Fengmin; Zhang, Yue; Tian, Boyang; Zhou, Zheng; Ye, Li; Carozza, Jesse C.; Yan, Wensheng; Han, Haixiang; Xu, Chunhua								Phase evolution of the surface iron (hydr)oxides to the iron sulfide through anion exchange during sulfidation of zero valent iron								JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS				424						127486	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127486		OCT 2021		FEB 15 2022	2022	The naturally-formed iron (hydr)oxides on the surface of zero valent iron (ZVI) have long been considered as passivation layer and inert phases which significantly reduce the reaction activities when they are employed in environmental remediation. Although it seems there are no direct benefits to keep these passivation layers, here, we show that such phases are necessary intermediates for the transformation to iron sulfides through an anion exchange pathway during sulfidation of ZVI. The pre-formed (hydr)oxides undergo a phase evolution upon aging and specific phases can be effectively trapped, which can be confirmed by a combination of different characterization techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Xray powder diffraction (XRPD), and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. Interestingly, after sulfidation, the resultant samples originated from different (hydr)oxides demonstrate different activities in the Cr(VI) sequestration. The XANES investigation of Fe K edge and Fe L2,3 edge indicates Fe remains the same after sulfidation, suggesting a non-redox, anion exchange reaction pathway for the production of iron sulfides, where O2- anions are directly replaced with S2-. Consequently, the structural characteristics of the parent (hydr) oxides are inherited by the as-formed iron sulfides, which make them behave differently because of their different structural natures.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000719939500004	34736181

X-ray diffraction measurement indicates that single-crystal hexagonal GaN with its basal plane parallel to the Si(111) plane is grown. Using a scanning electron microscope, the macroscopic evolution of GaN grown on the AlOx/Si(111) substrate is found to be similar to that of GaN grown on a sapphire(0001) substrate. Cathodoluminescence (CL) spectrum shows a unique emission that consists of several peaks with the intensity comparable to that of the near-band-edge emission. Unique characteristics in CL spectrum are discussed in terms of a possible oxygen contamination of GaN grown on the AlOx/Si(111) substrate. (C) 1997 American Institute of Physics.

The precursor films were created by pulsed laser deposition. The obtained molybdenum disulfide films consisted of 2H-MoS2 nanocrystals with laminar packing of basal planes oriented perpendicular to the film surface. The increase in the sulfurization temperature from 500 degrees C to 800 degrees C provided better quality of local packing and, as a consequence, reduction of electric resistance, higher concentration of carriers (electrons) and their mobility. The application of metal oxide precursor MoOy resulted in higher efficiency of synthesis of high quality MoS2 nanofilms. The efficiency of activation of the electrochemical processes of hydrogen production in an acidic solution was lower with crystalline MoS2 nanofilms than with amorphous MoSx films. Nanocrystalline MoS2 films, however, manifested improved photo- and electrocatalytic characteristics in activation of reactions of hydrogen and oxygen evolution in an alkaline solution.									1	0	1	0	0	0	2			1063-7788	1562-692X		WOS:000624543600007

The function of plant aquaporin also plays an important role in the reaction of plant growth and abiotic stress. 46 aquaporins genes were identified through the search and screening of the genome sequence of Medicago truncatula. The sizes of the aquaporin genes of M. truncatula were centralized uniform. Most of them were encoded by 200~400 amino acids. The distribution of isoelectric point was more dispersed, from the minimum pH 4.80 (Medtr5g012810.1) to the maximum pH 9.83 (Medtr4g049340.1), and showed no obvious clusters. The structure of aquaporins in Medicago truncatula was more consistent (2~4 introns). A combination of chromosomal location and phylogenetic evolution analysis showed that two pairs of genes on the same locus of chromosome 2 of Medicago truncatula, Medtr2g017570.1 and Medtr2g017610.1, Medtr2g017590.1 and Medtr2g017620.1, were highly similar in gene sequences, which might be produced by gene amplification. The expression patterns of Medtr2g017590.1 and Medtr2g017620.1 were gathered in a cluster branch of one expression pattern although different. The functional relationship between these two genes is worthy of further study.			植物水孔蛋白不仅调控水分运输,同时还可以在植物细胞间传递气体如CO_2,和营养物质如硼(B)、硅(Si和活性氧(ROS)),是多功能的蛋白质。植物水孔蛋白的功能对于植物生长和非生物胁迫的反应也起到重要的作用。对蒺藜苜蓿基因组序列进行检索和筛选,共鉴定出46个水孔蛋白基因。蒺藜苜蓿水孔蛋白基因大小较为集中均一(绝大多数由200~400个氨基酸编码)。等电点的分布则较为分散,从最小pH 4.80 (Medtr5g- 012810.1)到最大pH 9.83 (Medtr4g049340.1),均有分布,并无明显的集群特征。蒺藜苜蓿水孔蛋白基因的结构较为一致(2~4个内含子)。结合染色体定位和系统进化分析,蒺藜苜蓿二号染色体上同一位点的两对基因,分别是Medtr2g017570.1和Medtr2g017610.1,Medtr2g017590.1和Medtr2g017620.1,基因序列几乎完全一致。应该是由于基因扩增产生的。而Medtr2g017590.1和Medtr2g017620.1两个基因的表达模式,虽然有差别,但是聚集在一个表达模式聚类分枝上。这两个基因功能上的相互关系,很值得进一步的研究。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1672-416X			CSCD:6278352

Using an equimolar mixture of Fe2+, Co2+, and Fe3+ during co-precipitation, a mixture of LDH, ((FeCoII)-Co-II)(2/3)Fe-1/3(III)(OH)(2)(CO3)(1/6)mH(2)O, and the target spinel CoFe2O4 can be obtained in the precursor. During calcination, the remaining Fe-II fraction of the LDH is oxidized to Fe-III leading to an overall Co2+:Fe3+ ratio of 1:2 as required for spinel crystallization. This pre-adjustment of the spinel composition in the LDH precursor suggests a topotactic crystallization of cobalt ferrite and yields phase pure spinel in unusual anisotropic platelet morphology. The preferred topotactic relationship in most particles is [111](Spinel)vertical bar[001](LDH). Due to the anion decomposition, holes are formed throughout the quasi monocrystalline platelets. This synthesis approach can be used for different ferrites and the unique microstructure leads to unusual chemical properties as shown by the application of the ex-LDH cobalt ferrite as catalyst in the selective oxidation of 2-propanol. Compared to commercial cobalt ferrite, which mainly catalyzes the oxidative dehydrogenation to acetone, the main reaction over the novel ex-LDH cobalt is dehydration to propene. Moreover, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of the ex-LDH catalyst was markedly higher compared to the commercial material.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000410329100003	28657661

Crystal structure and dielectric properties of the group of Bi1.5-2xZn1+2xNb1.5O7-x (with x = 0-0.3) compositions have been studied. The compounds departured badly from stoichiomeric compositions lead to structural distortion and unbalance of pyrochlore phase, till secondary phase occurs for x = 0.3. It can be inferred from Raman spectra that the concentration and ratio of species occupied B site is stable, while those of species occupied A site vary between the series compositions. It is reasonable to reckon that zinc dominantly occupies B site in pyrochlore structure with compositions varying. The experimental results show that dielectric constant (epsilon) decrease linearly while the temperature coefficient of dielectric constant (alpha(epsilon)) effectively increases with increasing of the x-value. Crystal distortion and structural defect resulting from chemical composition unbalance bring on the change of dielectric properties for the small x-value.

Nevertheless, the use of fuel cell technology has been limited by factors such as the high cost of the different components from which a fuel cell is constituted. One of such components is platinum, used because it is the best catalyst to carry out the electrochemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, responsible for the production of electrical energy. In the search of the optimization and/or substitution of platinum, it is important to count on a methodology that allows to make a diagnosis in situ of the state of the catalyst. This diagnosis involves aspects such as: the determination of the active sites, and loads and degradation that the catalyst can suffer during the operation of the cell. The present work consists of the development of a mathematical model that fed with the rate constants and the phenomena involved in hydrogen evolution reaction, produces like output data, the polarization curves (E vs I) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for this reaction. The monocrystalline Pt(111) and Pt(100) were considered like catalyst and diverse acids were used like electrolytes. The curves obtained with the mathematical algorithm show a correlation between the influence of the type and concentration of acids used like electrolytes and the current density due to the evolution of H(2). Finally, this model leaves an open possibility to explore the effect of different values involved in the reactions of a fuel cell, which will allow us to evaluate in situ the state and behavior of the catalyst.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0188-4999			WOS:000207733100003

Phosphorylation of D1 protein was not observed in a moss Ceratodon purpureus. To study the effect of protein phosphorylation on D1 degradation, thylakoids isolated from pumpkin leaves and Ceratodon were phosphorylated in vitro in the presence of ATP before being subjected to photoinhibitory illumination. The rate of photoinhibition of Photosystem II oxygen evolution was not influenced by phosphorylation conditions in pumpkin or Ceratodon thylakoids. D1 protein in its phosphorylated form in pumpkin thylakoids was degraded significantly more slowly whereas in Ceratodon the degradation of D1 protein occurred rapidly with or without the presence of ATP in the photoinhibitory medium. Depletion of Mg2+ ions also blocked the degradation of unphosphorylated D1 protein in pumpkin thylakoid membranes. We conclude that degradation of the D1 protein in higher plants is regulated by phosphorylation on the substrate level and its optimal rate requires the presence of Mg2+.

We report the use of MIMS to characterize the catalytic properties of oxalate oxidase (E.C. 1.2.3.4) from Ceriporiopsis subvermispora (CsOxOx). Oxalate oxidase is a manganese dependent enzyme that catalyzes the oxygen-dependent oxidation of oxalate to carbon dioxide in a reaction that is coupled with the formation of hydrogen peroxide. CsOxOx is the first bicupin enzyme identified that catalyzes this reaction. The MIMS method of measuring OxOx activity involves continuous, real-time direct detection of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production from the ion currents of their respective mass peaks. C-13(2)-oxalate was used to allow for accurate detection of (CO2)-C-13 (m/z 45) despite the presence of adventitious (CO2)-C-12. Steady-state kinetic constants determined by MIMS are comparable to those obtained by a continuous spectrophotometric assay in which H2O2 production is coupled to the horseradish peroxidase catalyzed oxidation of 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid). Furthermore, we used MIMS to determine that NO inhibits the activity of the CsOxOx with a K1 of 0.58 +/- 0.06 mu M. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Charging converts lead sulfate formed during discharge into active materials by reduction of Pb2+ ions. If this is controlled by mass transfer of the ions to the electrochemically active area, charging voltage can far exceed the OCV of a charged battery. Then, charge is partly consumed to electrolyse water, and for evolution of hydrogen and oxygen. It causes sulfation since regeneration of active materials will be incomplete. A mathematical model is developed incorporating resistance to mass transfer of Pb2+ ions into the rate of charge transfer reactions, changes in areas of active materials and sulfate particles, and dependence of electrodes' resistance on content of lead sulfate. It was used to show that this mechanism of sulfation does lead to failure of flooded LABs because of increased resistance of electrodes, and to predict cycle life. Capacity fade, and increased cycle life when recharging protocol uses lower DoD are other features of degradation which the model predicts. The model also predicts the observed increase in cycle life when conducting additives are added to the negative electrode. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

The photocatalysts are characterized by XRD, FSEM, HRTEM, XPS and UV-vis spectroscopic study. As for WO3-x NCs synthesized under different temperature, the highest photocatalytic efficiency was achieved for the W18O49 NCs prepared at 160 degrees C at C3H6 evolution rate of 145 mu mol h(-1) g(-1). When it comes to the WO3-x NCs obtained using different solvents, the sea urchin-like W18O49 microspheres synthesized in ethanol has the greatest activity for photocatalytic dehydration of IPA. Their outstanding photocatalytic performances may stem from the large amount of oxygen vacancies (OVs) on their surfaces. The above results suggest the high potential of WO3-x NCs in application for C3H6 production.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			2468-0230			WOS:000459836200029

Ferroelectric and multiferroic materials have attracted significant interest and could prove promising for photovoltaic applications. Here, we report the structural evolution and its relationship with the optical, magnetic, and ferroelectric properties of Ba0.92Bi0.08Ti(1-x)CoxO3, abbreviated as BBT:Cox (0 <= x <= 0.08) ceramic prepared by a solid-state reaction technique. Refinement analyses of X-ray data show that incorporating Co ions into the Ti sites of BBT host lattices gives rise to a single tetragonal phase with no evidence of a secondary phase. Direct evidence of Ti3+ surface defects and oxygen vacancies has been carried out via an XPS study. The optical research showed that the BBT bandgap was successfully tuned from 3.21 to 2.61 eV. The tuning in bandgap is explained based on the charge compensation and octahedral distortion mechanisms. In the room-temperature magnetic properties measurements, the pure BBT sample is diamagnetic, whereas the BBT:Cox sample is ferromagnetic. The reversible polarization induced by an electric field indicates the ferroelectric character of the ceramics at room temperature. The results obtained in this work may help construct intrinsic multiferroics to develop photovoltaic devices for next-generation applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000802314100005

The emerging catalyst with core-shell heterostructure has excited the potentiality of non noble-metal candidates. Herein, in order to enhance the sufficient exposure and utilization of actives sites and accelerate the electron transfer rate of catalyst, NixSy@MoS2 core shell nanorods decorated NiSe2 framework (NixSy@MoS2/NiSe2) electrocatalyst has been successfully prepared via interface engineering. As expected, the as-prepared catalyst shows an outstanding OER activity with a small overpotential of 360 mV to drive 100 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 64 mV dec(-1). More importantly, a low cell voltage of 1.40 V is achieved for the NixSy@MoS2/NiSe2 based water splitting electrolyzer at 10 mA cm(-2), and it shows negligible decrement after continuous operation for 100 h. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations further uncovered the synergetic catalytic effect between the NixSy@MoS2 core-shell nanorods and the NiSe2 framework played a key role in generating more charge carriers and declining the energy barriers in the process of forming intermediates.

In this work, the electrocatalytic activity of Pd supported on MoS2 and nitrogen, sulfur-doped reduced graphene oxide (Pd/MoS2/N,S-rGO) was investigated by two-step hydrothermal method followed by chemical reduction of Pd using sodium borohydride (NaBH4). The Structural and morphological structure of the sample was studied by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) techniques. The electrochemical hydrogen evolution (HER) performance of the electrocatalyst was studied by using Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV), Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), and Chronoamperometry (CA). The result shows a structural transformation in the MoS2 phase after the incorporation of Pd nanoparticles. The synthesized (Pd/MoS2/N,S-rGO) electrocatalyst shows a significantly lower overpotential of -42 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA/cm(2) and Tafel slope value of 38 mV.dec(-1). This study demonstrated with low palladium loading, the high activity of the electrocatalyst could have resulted from the cumulative effect of 1T MoS2, sulfur vacancy formation, and higher surface area of N,S-rGO.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000549319900044

B	Suseno, S.								Homo- and Heteronuclear Transition Metal Complexes Supported by Multinucleating Ligands								Homo- and Heteronuclear Transition Metal Complexes Supported by Multinucleating Ligands								357 pp	357 pp						2015	2015	This dissertation is mainly divided into two sub-parts: organometallic and bioinorganic/materials projects. The approach for the projects involves the use of two different multinucleating ligands to synthesize monoand multinuclear complexes. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis of a multinucleating tris(phosphinoaryl)benzene ligand used to support mono-nickel and palladium complexes. The isolated mononuclear complexes were observed to undergo intramolecular arene C-H to C-P functionalization. The transformation was studied by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, and represents a rare type of C-H functionalization mechanism, facilitated by the interactions of the group 10 metal with the arene pi-system. Chapter 3 describes the construction of multinickel complexes supported by the same triphosphine ligand from Chapter 2. This chapter shows how the central arene in the ligand's triarylbenzene framework can interact with dinickel and trinickel moieties in various binding modes. X-ray diffraction studies indicated that all compounds display strong metal-arene interactions. A cofacial triangulo nickel(0) complex supported by this ligand scaffold was also isolated and characterized. This chapter demonstrates the use of an arene as versatile ligand design element for small molecular clusters. Chapter 4 presents the syntheses of a series of discrete mixed transition metal Mn oxido clusters and their characterization. The synthesis of these oxide clusters displaying two types of transition metals were targeted for systematic metal composition-property studies relevant to mixed transition metal oxides employed in electrocatalysis. A series of heterometallic trimanganese tetraoxido cubanes capped with a redox-active metal [MMn3O 4] (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) was synthesized starting from a [CaMn3 O4] precursor and structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography and anomalous diffraction to conclusively determine that M is incorporated at a single position in the cluster. The electrochemical properties of these complexes were studied via cyclic voltammetry. The redox chemistry of the series of complexes was investigated by the addition of a reductant and oxidant. X-ray absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies were also employed to evaluate the product of the oxidation/reduction reaction to determine the site of electron transfer given the presence of two types of redox-active metals. Additional studies on oxygen atom transfer reactivities of [MMn 3O4] and [MMn3O2] series were performed to investigate the effect of the heterometal M in the reaction rates. Chapter 5 focuses on the use of [CoMn3O4] and [NiMn 3O4] cubane complexes discussed in Chapter 4 as precursors to heterogeneous oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. These well-defined complexes were dropcasted on electrodes with/without heat treatment, and the OER activities of the resulting films were evaluated. Multiple spectroscopic techniques were performed on the surface of the electrocatalysts to gain insight into the structure-function relationships based on the heterometallic composition. Depending on film preparation, the Co-Mn-oxide was found to change metal composition during catalysis, while the NiMn oxide maintained the NiMn3 ratio. These studies represent the use of discrete heterometallic-oxide clusters as precursors for heterogeneous water oxidation catalysts. Appendix A describes the ongoing effort to synthesize a series of heteromultimetallic [MMn3X] clusters (X = O, S, F). Complexes such as [ZnMn3O], [CoMn3O], [Mn3S], and [Mn4F] have been synthesized and structurally characterized. An amino-bis-oxime ligand (PRABO) has been installed on the [ZnMn3O] cluster. Upon the addition of O 2, the desymmetrized [ZnMn3O] cluster only underwent an outer-sphere, one-electron oxidation. Efforts to build and manipulate other heterometallic [MMn3X] clusters are still ongoing, targeting O2 binding and reduction. Appendix B summarizes the multiple synthetic approaches to build a [Co 4O4]-cubane complex relevant to heterogeneous OER electrocatalysis. Starting with the tricobalt cluster [LCo3(O2CR) 3] and treatment various strong oxidants that can serve as oxygen atom source in the presence Co2+ salt only yielded tricobalt mono-oxo complexes. Appendix C presents the efforts to model the H-cluster framework of [FeFe]-hydrogenase by incorporating a synthetic diiron complex onto a protein-supported or a synthetic ligand-supported [Fe4S4]-cluster. The mutant ferredoxin with a [Fe4S4]-cluster and triscarbene ligand have been characterized by multiple spectroscopic techniques. The reconstruction of an H-cluster mimic has not yet been achieved, due to the difficulty of obtaining crystallographic evidence and the ambiguity of the EPR results.									0	0	0		0	0	0					978-13-393-8376-7	INSPEC:16773384

Metallic Ni-based electrocatalysts are expensive and eco-hazardous. This has rendered the replacement or reduction of Ni content in Ni-based electrocatalysts a decisive criterion in the development of bifunctional electrocatalytic materials. In the current study, spinel/ilmenite composite nickel titanate (NTO) nanofibers were synthesised using sol-gel assisted electrospinning followed by pyrolysis at different soaking temperatures (viz., 773, 973, and 1173 K). The presence of a defective spinel NTO phase (SNTO) distributed uniformly along the nanofibers was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopy. The electron micrographs revealed the morphological change of NTO nanofibers from a mosaic to bamboo structure with an increase in pyrolysis soaking temperature. The electrocatalytic activity of NTO nanofibers obtained at different pyrolysis soaking temperatures for alkaline water-splitting was studied. The highly defective SNTO manifests properties similar to metallic Ni and favours H-2 evolution through the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by adsorbing more H+ ions on active sites. In contrast, the ilmenite NTO favours O-2 discharge. These results are explained based on the morphology of the NTO nanofibers. The mosaic structure which has higher porosity and greater SNTO content shows excellent HER performance. In contrast, the large bamboo structured NTO nanofibers which have lesser porosity and SNTO content cage the bigger (OH)(ads) ions at their catalytic sites to facilitate OER performance.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000481917100028	31384875

USE - As lithium mixed transition metal oxide, useful for cathode active material for a secondary battery (claimed), which is useful for mobile equipment. ADVANTAGE - The Ni-based lithium mixed transition metal oxide has composition that exhibits intercalation/deintercalation of lithium ions into/from mixed transition metal oxide layers (MO layers) and interconnection of MO layers via insertion of portion of MO layer-derived Ni ions into intercalation/deintercalation layers (reversible lithium layers) of lithium ions. This improves structural stability of crystal structure upon charge/discharge and exhibits superior thermal stability to provide excellent sintering stability. In addition, battery comprising such cathode exerts high capacity and high cycle stability. Further, with substantially no water-soluble bases present as lithium, mixed transition metal oxide can be prepared without addition of excess of lithium source; and the lithium mixed transition metal oxide exhibits excellent storage stability and chemical resistance, and decreased gas evolution, resulting in excellent high-temperature stability/safety and feasibility of mass production at low cost. The molar ratio of lithium to the mixed transition metal is 0.95:1 to 1.04:1, which leads to appropriate cation mixing, enhances structural stability and minimizes hindrance of Li+ migration during charge and discharge process. Therefore, lithium mixed transition metal oxide exhibits excellent stability, lifespan characteristics and rate characteristics. The conventional lithium transition metal oxide has crystal structure with no insertion of Ni2+ ions into metal oxide layer as effected by reaction of identical precursor materials under oxygen atmosphere, whereas lithium mixed transition metal oxide has a structure where relatively large amounts of Ni2+ ions are produced by carrying out reaction under oxygen-deficient atmosphere and portion of thus-produced Ni2+ ions are inserted into reversible lithium layers. Therefore, crystal structure is stably maintained to exert superior sintering stability, and secondary battery exhibits excellent cycle stability. It is shown that intercalation/deintercalation of lithium ions will not be hindered when a portion of nickel ions present transfer to and are immobilized in reversible lithium layers, without disintegration of crystal structure with maintenance of oxidation number of Ni ions inserted into reversible lithium layers, even when lithium ions are released during charge process, thus capable of maintaining a well-layered structure. As a result, since lifespan characteristics and safety of lithium mixed transition metal oxide are simultaneously improved due to lack of occurrence of additional structural collapse by oxygen desorption and prevention of further formation of Ni2+ ions, battery capacity and cycle characteristics can be significantly improved and desired level of rate characteristics can be exerted. The lithium mixed transition metal oxide is further substantially free of Li2CO3 as impurities due to stability of atomic-level structure, resulting from oxygen deficiency due to decrease in and decomposition of Ni3+ ions, and exhibits no degradation of crystal structure, even when subjected to high-temperature sintering under air atmosphere. As the oxide can be sintered at low temperature, it has small amounts of grain boundaries. In addition, as retention of unreacted lithium species on surfaces of particles is prevented, particle surfaces are substantially free of lithium salts such as lithium carbonates, and lithium sulfates. Further, there is no need to add an excess of lithium source, so it is possible to prevent problem associated with formation of impurities due to unreacted lithium source remaining in powder. The lithium mixed transition metal oxide can be prepared by solid-state reaction of Li2CO3 and mixed transition metal precursors in air atmosphere. Thus, it is possible to realize significant reduction of production costs and high-efficiency mass production. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - New lithium mixed transition metal oxide (A1) comprises: a composition of formula LixM'yO2 (I), and comprises mixed transition metal oxide (MO) layers comprising Ni ions, and reversible lithium layers which allow intercalation and deintercalation of lithium ions; where the MO layers and the reversible lithium layers are disposed alternately and repeatedly to form a layered crystal structure, and a portion of Ni ions derived from the MO layer are inserted into reversible lithium layers to interconnect the MO layers and the reversible lithium layers.M'=(M'1)1-k(A')k;M'1=(Ni)1-a-b((Ni)1/2(Mn)1/2)a(Co)b;a+b=0.65-0.85;b=0.1-0.4;A'=dopant;k=0-0.05;x+y=2;x=0.95-1.05.INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for the following:(1) a cathode active material (M'') for secondary battery comprising: the lithium mixed transition metal oxide (A1); and(2) a lithium secondary battery comprising: the cathode active material (M'').															0						DIIDW:2011F35878

Ocean redox chemistry exerts a strong control on the biogeochemical cycling of phosphorus, a limiting nutrient, and hence on primary production, but the response of the phosphorus cycle to this major ocean redox transition has not been investigated. Here, we use a geochemical speciation technique to investigate the phase partitioning of phosphorus in an open marine, early Neoproterozoic succession from the Huainan Basin, North China. We find that effective removal of bioavailable phosphorus in association with iron minerals in a globally ferruginous ocean resulted in oligotrophic (nutrient limited) conditions, and hence a probable global decrease in primary production, organic carbon burial and, subsequently, oxygen production. Nevertheless, phosphorus availability and organic carbon burial were sufficient to maintain an oxidizing atmosphere. These data imply substantial nutrient-driven variability in atmospheric oxygen levels through the Proterozoic, rather than the stable levels commonly invoked.Early Neoproterozoic marine productivity fell due to nutrient drawdown following a switch from an iron-rich to a sulfide-rich ocean, according to records of phosphorus geochemistry measured from sedimentary sections in North China.									34	2	0	0	6	0	36			1752-0894	1752-0908		WOS:000517739500002

Unfortunately, single-component photocatalyst still suffers from sluggish reaction kinetics. In this work, a noble-metal free photocatalytic system of nitrogen-doped carbon@Co embedded in carbon nanotubes (NC@Co-NCT)/cadmium sulfide (CdS) is fabricated by coupling CdS nanorods with the metal-organic framework-derived Co encapsulated nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) material. The optimal photocatalytic activity of NC@Co-NCT/CdS is determined to be 3.8 mmol h(-1) g(-1), which is approximate to 5.8 times of CdS. By combining the experimental evidences and density functional theory calculations, a novel photoelectron transfer channel in the heterojunction interfaces is revealed, expediting the migration and separation of photo-induced charge carriers of CdS. Moreover, the presence of Co nanoclusters can act as the active sites, boosting the H-2 evolution reaction. This study can present a new avenue to design advanced photocatalysts with high-efficiency electrons and holes separation.									21	2	0	0	1	0	21			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000664643900001	34160911

Our knowledge about the architecture of the reaction centre (RC) complex and the mechanisms of charge separation and stabilisation is well advanced. However, our understanding of the processes associated with the functioning of RC is incomplete: the photochemical activity of PSII is routinely monitored by chlorophyll-a fluorescence induction but the presently available data are not free of controversy. In this work, we examined the nature of gradual fluorescence rise of PSII elicited by trains of singleturnover saturating flashes (STSFs) in the presence of a PSII inhibitor, permitting only one stable charge separation. We show that a substantial part of the fluorescence rise originates from lightinduced processes that occur after the stabilisation of charge separation, induced by the first STSF; the temperature-dependent relaxation characteristics suggest the involvement of conformational changes in the additional rise. In experiments using double flashes with variable waiting times (Delta tau) between them, we found that no rise could be induced with zero or short Delta tau, the value of which depended on the temperature -revealing a previously unknown rate-limiting step in PSII.									25	1	0	0	24	0	25			2045-2322			WOS:000424634000009	29426901	
J	Jajoo, A; Bharti, S; Mohanty, P								Evaluation of the specific roles of anions in electron transport and energy transfer reactions in photosynthesis								PHOTOSYNTHETICA				39	3			321	337		10.1023/A:1015125008028				2001	2001	Ionic environment is important in regulating photosynthetic reactions. The roles of cations, Mn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Na+, and K+ as cofactors in electron transport, energy transfer, phosphorylation, and carbon assimilation are better known than the roles of anions, except for chloride and bicarbonate. Only a limited information exists on the roles and effects of nitrite, formate, sulphate, and phosphate. In this review, we evaluate and highlight the roles of some specific anions on electron transport as well as on excitation energy transfer processes in photosynthesis. Anions exert significant effects on thylakoid membrane conformation and membrane fluidity, possibly by redistributing the thylakoid membrane surface charges. The anion/cation induced phase transitions in the hydrophilic domains of the thylakoid membranes are probably responsible for the various structural and co-related functional changes under stress. Anions are also important in regulation of energy distribution between the two photosystems. Anions do not only divert more energy from photosystem (PS) 2 to PS1, but can also reverse the effect of cations on energy distribution in a valence-dependent manner. Anions affect also the structure of the photosynthetic apparatus and excitation energy distribution between the two photosystems.									12	3	0	0	12	0	14			0300-3604	1573-9058		WOS:000173545700001

Extensive analysis on the evolutionary genomic contexts considered herein to unravel its intergenomic relationship and metabolic adjustment acquired from the genomic content of Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus Delta H. We demonstrated its intergenomic distance, genome function, synteny homologs and gene families, origin of replication, and methanogenesis to reveal the evolutionary relationships between Methanobrevibacter and Methanothermobacter. Comparison of the phylogenetic and metabolic markers was suggested for its archaeal metabolic core lineage that might have evolved from Methanothermobacter. Orthologous genes involved in its hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis might be acquired from intergenomic ancestry of Methanothermobacter via Methanobacterium formicicum. Formate dehydrogenase (fdhAB) coding gene cluster and carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (cooF) coding gene might have evolved from duplication events within Methanobreviba cter-Methanothermobacter lineage, and fdhCD gene cluster acquired from bacterial origins. Genome-wide metabolic survey found the existence of four novel pathways viz. L-tyrosine catabolism, mevalonate pathway II, acyl-carrier protein metabolism II and glutathione redox reactions II in MRU. Finding of these pathways suggested that MRU has shown a metabolic potential to tolerate molecular oxygen, antimicrobial metabolite biosynthesis and atypical lipid composition in cell wall, which was acquainted by metabolic cross-talk with mammalian bacterial origins. We conclude that coevolution of genomic contents between Methanobrevibacter and Methanothermobacter provides a clue to understand the metabolic adaptation of MRU in the rumen at different environmental niches.

The abundances are obtained via detailed photoionization modelling which takes into account all the observational constraints ( including geometry and aperture effects) using the pseudo-3D photoionization code Cloudy_3D. The spectral energy distribution of the ionizing radiation is taken from appropriate model atmospheres. Incidentally we find from the new observational constraints that both stellar components contribute to the ionization: the "cool" one provides the bulk of hydrogen ionization, while the "hot" one is responsible for the presence of the most highly charged ions, which explains why previous attempts to model the nebula experienced difficulties.The nebular abundances of C, N, O, and Ne are found to be 1/3.5, 1/4.2, 1/70, and 1/11 of the solar value respectively, with uncertainties of a factor 2. Thus the extreme O deficiency of this object is confirmed. The abundances of S and Ar are less than 1/30 of solar. The abundance of He relative to H is 0.089 +/- 0.009.Standard models of stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis cannot explain the abundance pattern observed in the nebula. To obtain an extreme oxygen deficiency in a star whose progenitor has an initial mass of about 1 M-circle dot requires an additional mixing process, which can be induced by stellar rotation and/or by the presence of the close companion. We have computed a stellar model with an initial mass of 1 M-circle dot, appropriate metallicity, and initial rotation of 100 km s(-1), and find that rotation greatly improves the agreement between the predicted and observed abundances.									20	0	0	0	0	1	20			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000275752400044

Herein, we report the synthesis of nickel selenide (NiSe) supported by three-dimensional conducting nickel foam (NF) as a substrate via hydrothermal process for a short duration of only two-hours. Further, the addition of selenium (Se) and sulfur (S) in different ratios during the synthesis, resulted in the formation of well-ordered nickel seleno-sulfide (NiSeS/NF) nanostructures. Electron microscopy analysis revealed a unique hexagonal nanorod morphology of NiSeS grew on top of the NF, whereas NiSe/NF revealed the flake-like structures. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of these samples were studied in an alkaline (1 M KOH) environment. The addition of 'S' significantly enhanced the OER performance of NiSe/NF and the variation of OER performance with respect to different Se/S ratios was studied. The Se/S ratio of 0.75:0.25 delivered the best performance with a two-fold increase in overall current density with respect to NiSe/NF. At last, this work also shed light on formation of oxyanions and the conceivable mechanism after prolonged electrolysis.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the efficiency of water electrolysis suffers from the sluggish kinetics and high overpotential of OER. Although NiFe LDH is regarded as a promising OER catalyst, it faces the problem of poor conductivity, resulting in the limitations of HER performance. Herein, a hybrid nano-architecture of CoNiN@NiFe LDH as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting is fabricated via in-situ electrochemically assembling hierarchical NiFe LDH nanosheets on the surface of CoNiN. CoNiN@NiFe LDH shows excellent activities for OER with the overpotentials of 227 and 291 mV to deliver the current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, an alkaline electrolyzer with CoNiN@NiFe LDH as anode and cathode requires a cell voltage of 1.63 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, the excellent stability with 100 h towards overall water splitting outperforms most transition metal-based bifunctional electrocatalysts. The superior performance is attributed to the abundant active sites, the strong electronic interaction, and the corresponding metal (oxy) hydroxides species generated by in situ surface reconstruction and phase transformation.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000711224900004

FORMATION OF KETENE (H2CCO) IN INTERSTELLAR ANALOGOUS METHANE (CH4)-CARBON MONOXIDE (CO) ICES: A COMBINED FTIR AND REFLECTRON TIME-OF-FLIGHT MASS SPECTROSCOPIC STUDY								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				789	1					36	10.1088/0004-637X/789/1/36				JUL 1 2014	2014	The formation of ketene (H2CCO) inmethane-carbon monoxide (CH4-CO) ices was investigated upon its exposure to ionizing radiation in the form of energetic electrons at 5.5 K. The radiation-induced nonthermal equilibrium processing of these ices was monitored online and in situ via infrared spectroscopy complimented with postirradiation temperature programmed desorption studies exploiting highly sensitive reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ReTOF) coupled with single photon fragment-free photo ionization (PI) at 10.49 eV. The detection of ketene in irradiated (isotopically labeled) methane-carbon monoxide ices was confirmed via the nu(2) infrared absorption band and substantiated during the warm-up phase based on sublimation profiles obtained from the ReTOF-PI spectra of the corresponding isotopic masses. The experiments conducted with the mixed isotopic ices of (CD4)-C-12-(CO)-C-13 provide clear evidence of the formation of at least two ketene isotopomers ((D2CCO)-C-12-C-13 and (D2CCO)-C-13-C-13), allowing for the derivation of two competing formation pathways. We have also proposed underlying reaction mechanisms to the formation of ketene based on kinetic fitting of the temporal evolution of the ketene isotopomers.									45	0	0	0	1	0	45			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000338103400036

We report a new and efficient synthesis route to produce an active and stable catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline environments. The catalyst consists of manganese oxide (MnOx) supported onto glassy carbon (GC) particles, which serve as a support material that is more resistant to heat and corrosion than conventional high surface area carbon supports. Impregnation of the MnOx onto the GC particles followed by high-temperature calcination generates a catalytically active Mn3O4 surface with a nanostructured morphology. The MnOx-GC particles display high activity for the ORR in an alkaline electrolyte, comparable to that of best-known non-precious metal catalysts and within 0.15 V of a commercial Pt catalyst. Accelerated durability testing reveals excellent stability of the MnOx-GC catalyst, maintaining nearly 60% of its activity after 30,000 cyclic voltammograms. The catalyst was integrated into the cathode of an alkaline exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) with Pt at the anode, achieving a peak power density of 98 mW/cm(2) at 70 degrees C, demonstrating the viability of the MnOx-GC catalyst in a device environment.

We here report evidence for sequence insertions in the nuclear genomes of plants that are derived from noncoding regions of the mitochondrial genome. Fragments of mitochondrial group II introns are identified in the nuclear genomes of tobacco and a bean species. The duplicated intron sequences of 75-140 bp are derived from cis- and trans-splicing introns of genes encoding subunits 1 and 5 of the NADH dehydrogenase. The mitochondrial sequences are inserted in the vicinities of a lectin gene, different glucanase genes and a gene encoding a subunit of photosystem II. Sequence similarities between the nuclear and mitochondrial copies are in the range of 80 to 97%, suggesting recent transfer events that occurred in the basic glucanase genes before and in the lectin gene after the gene duplications in the evolution of the nuclear gene families. Overlapping regions of the same introns are in two instances also involved in intramitochondrial sequence duplications.									21	0	0	0	17	0	23			0022-2844			WOS:A1994NX16800005	7932778

In this work, we show at an atomic scale the Mg2+ diffusion pathways, kinetics, and reaction products at the Fe3O4/MgO heterostructures under different oxygen partial pressures but with the same thermal annealing conditions. Combining microscopic, optical, and spectroscopic techniques, we demonstrate that an oxygen-rich environment promotes facile Mg2+ incorporation into the Fe2+ sites, leading to the formation of Mg1-xFe2+xO4 spinel structures, where the corresponding portion of the Fe2+ ions are oxidized to Fe3+. Conversely, annealing in vacuum results in the formation of a thin interfacial rocksalt layer (Mg1-yFeyO), which serves as a blocking layer leading to significantly reduced Mg2+ diffusion to the bulk Fe3O4. The observed changes in transport and optical properties as a result of Mg diffusion are interpreted in light of the electronic structures determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Our results reveal the critical role of available anions in governing cation diffusion in the spinel structures and the need to prevent formation of unwanted reaction intermediates for the promotion of facile cation diffusion.									4	1	0	0	0	0	5			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000595533800039	33074667

Herein, a facile and effective route for the synthesis of N/S co-doped porous carbon by capitalizing on hetero-atom containing PAN as a doped carbon source and ZnCl2 as a volatile porogen is reported. Notably, the optimal porous carbon (denoted as FeZ-CNS-900) with a large specific surface area of up to 1730 m(2) g(-1) exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity with a half-wave potential of 0.881 V, which is 39 mV more positive than that of commercial Pt/C under alkaline conditions, as well as robust durability and methanol tolerance. Interestingly, the use of N/S co-doped porous carbon also offers comparable ORR activity yet much higher stability than that of Pt/C under acidic conditions. Finally, the implementation of FeZ-CNS-900 as the air-cathode catalyst for primary Zn-air batteries yields an open-circuit potential of 1.49 V, a high peak power density of 168 mW cm(-2), a large specific capacity of 778 mA h g(Zn)(-1) (corresponding to an energy density of 1020 W h kg(Zn)(-1)) and a remarkable durability.									31	2	0	0	0	0	31			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472225200038

Here, we provide an insight into defect relaxation in metastable ZnO nanoparticles, which are prepared via nonequilibrium laser ablation in liquid media, reflected by the Raman vibrations of surface optical (SO) and volume phonons, as well as by the evolution of luminescence. During the annealing process, the SO and volume phonon modes exhibit strong incompatibility and a unique "intermission" period in the temperature range from 300 degrees C to 400 degrees C, in which both the vibrations are completely suppressed in the Raman spectra. Combined with the corresponding defects-related photoluminescence spectra, it is demonstrated that there exists a delay between the reconstruction of the interfacial defects and annihilation of other intrinsic defects, including interstitial zinc and oxygen vacancy in the relaxation process, and that the sequence of different defects of ZnO in the order of instability is interfacial defect, interstitial zinc, and then oxygen vacancy. Such defect relaxation will deepen our understanding of some of the properties of semiconducting nanomaterials, including luminescence, photocatalysis, electronic transport, sensing and others.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000358207400081	26151820

Herein, we reported an original construction strategy of thin-leaf-shaped cobalt phosphide coupled with copper nanoclusters supported on nickel foam (NF) for HER. A simple electrochemical deposition technique is used to obtain the interface-engineered Co2P@Cu nanostructure. The resultant nanocomposite with a vertically staggered structure shows the enhanced electrochemical characteristics derived from the Schottky junction at the interface between Co2P and Cu, which has a large of active sites and low charge-transfer resistance. The Schottky effect promotes charge distribution, accelerates adsorption of hydrogen intermediates, and facilitates electron transfer in the Co2P. As a result, the Co2P@Cu composite drives the current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) for the alkaline HER to reach the lower overpotentials of 99.7 and 303.2 mV, respectively, and a smaller Tafel slope of 48.8 mV dec(-1) compared to the bare Co2P electrocatalyst. Moreover, the proposed electrode exhibits good HER durability with almost no loss of Cu based on 2000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry sweeps and 24 h of chronoamperometry test. This work offers a perspective for the additive engineering of non-noble metals to metal phosphides toward efficient HER. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Sickle Cell Hemoglobin in the Ferryl State Promotes beta Cys-93 Oxidation and Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Epithelial Lung Cells (E10)								JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY				290	46			27939	27958		10.1074/jbc.M115.651257				NOV 13 2015	2015	Polymerization of intraerythrocytic deoxyhemoglobin S (HbS) is the primary molecular event that leads to hemolytic anemia in sickle cell disease (SCD). We reasoned that HbS may contribute to the complex pathophysiology of SCD in part due to its pseudoperoxidase activity. We compared oxidation reactions and the turnover of oxidation intermediates of purified human HbS and HbA. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) drives a catalytic cycle that includes the following three distinct steps: 1) initial oxidation of ferrous (oxy) to ferryl Hb; 2) autoreduction of the ferryl intermediate to ferric (metHb); and 3) reaction of metHb with an additional H2O2 molecule to regenerate the ferryl intermediate. Ferrous and ferric forms of both proteins underwent initial oxidation to the ferryl heme in the presence of H2O2 at equal rates. However, the rate of autoreduction of ferryl to the ferric form was slower in the HbS solutions. Using quantitative mass spectrometry and the spin trap, 5,5-dimethyl-1pyrroline-N-oxide, we found more irreversibly oxidized beta Cys-93 in HbS than in HbA. Incubation of the ferric or ferryl HbS with cultured lung epithelial cells (E10) induced a drop in mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate and impairment of cellular bioenergetics that was related to the redox state of the iron. Ferryl HbS induced a substantial drop in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and increases in cytosolic heme oxygenase (HO-1) expression and mitochondrial colocalization in E10 cells. Thus, highly oxidizing ferryl Hb and heme, the product of oxidation, may be central to the evolution of vasculopathy in SCD and may suggest therapeutic modalities that interrupt heme-mediated inflammation.									34	0	0	0	28	0	34				1083-351X		WOS:000365757500042	26396189

Herein, a bilayer TiO2/alpha-Fe2O3 nanorod (NR) arrays photoanode was prepared with deposited Cu-doped NiOx (Cu : NiOx) hole transport layer (HTL) and Co-Pi oxygen evolution reaction (OER) cocatalyst for PEC water oxidation. The hierarchical TiO2/alpha-Fe2O3 composite obtained by a secondary hydrothermal process exhibited an inapparent bilayer structure by embedding the underlayer TiO2 NR arrays at the bottom part of the post-grown alpha-Fe2O3 NR arrays. The underlayer TiO2 NRs acted as an effective shuttling pathway for transferring photoelectrons generated in the upper hematite light absorber layer. A p-type inter-Cu : NiOx HTL was introduced to form a build-in p-n electric field between Cu : NiOx and alpha-Fe2O3 NRs, which improved the hole extraction from alpha-Fe2O3 to Co-Pi OER catalyst. As expected, the as-engineered TiO2/alpha-Fe2O3/Cu : NiOx/Co-Pi photoanode displayed an excellent photocurrent density of 2.43 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (V-RHE), up to 4.05 and 2.23 times greater than those of the bare alpha-Fe2O3 (0.60 mA cm(-2)) and TiO2/alpha-Fe2O3, respectively. The results demonstrate that the bottom-up engineering of electron-hole transport channels and cocatalyst modification is an attractive maneuver to enhance the PEC water oxidation activity in hematite and other photoanodes.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000627044400001	33650268

J	Olson, John S.								Kinetic mechanisms for O-2 binding to myoglobins and hemoglobins								MOLECULAR ASPECTS OF MEDICINE				84						101024	10.1016/j.mam.2021.101024				APR 2022	2022	Antonini and Brunori's 1971 book "Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands" was a truly remarkable publication that summarized almost 100 years of research on O-2 binding to these globins. Over the ensuing 50 years, ultra-fast laser photolysis techniques, high-resolution and time resolved X-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations, and libraries of recombinant myoglobin (Mb) and hemoglobin (Hb) variants have provided structural interpretations of O-2 binding to these proteins. The resultant mechanisms provide quantitative descriptions of the stereochemical factors that govern overall affinity, including proximal and distal steric restrictions that affect iron reactivity and favorable positive electrostatic interactions that preferentially stabilize bound O-2. The pathway for O-2 uptake and release by Mb and subunits of Hb has been mapped by screening libraries of site-directed mutants in laser photolysis experiments. O-2 enters mammalian Mb and the a and beta subunits of human HbA through a channel created by upward and outward rotation of the distal His at the E7 helical position, is non-covalently captured in the interior of the distal cavity, and then internally forms a bond with the heme Fe(II) atom. O-2 dissociation is governed by disruption of hydrogen bonding interactions with His (E7), breakage of the Fe(II)-O-2 bond, and then competition between rebinding and escape through the E7-gate. The structural features that govern the rates of both the individual steps and overall reactions have been determined and provide the framework for: (1) defining the physiological functions of specific globins and their evolution; (2) understanding the clinical features of hemoglobinopathies; and (3) designing safer and more efficient acellular hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) for transfusion therapy, organ preservation, and other commercially relevant O-2 transport and storage processes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0098-2997	1872-9452		WOS:000771745400003	34544605

Although various properties of a-C:H:Si:O have been investigated, no definitive structure of a-C:H:Si:O has ever been proposed, nor has its thermally-induced structural evolution been thoroughly studied. The aim of this work is to better understand the structure of a-C:H:Si: O through solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies. Deeper insights into the thermally-driven structural evolution are obtained by annealing a-C:H:Si: O between 50 degrees C and 300 degrees C under anaerobic conditions and taking NMR/EPR measurements after each step. EPR results show that the number of paramagnetic defects decreases by 70% with annealing at 300 degrees C. H-1 NMR shows the hydrogen concentration decreases with annealing temperature from 2 x 10(22) g(-1), and then levels off at approximately 0.7 x 10(22) g(-1) for anneals between 200 degrees C and 300 degrees C. The carbonesiliconeoxygen network exhibits some structural reorganization, seen directly as a slight increase in the sp(2)/sp(3) ratio in the C-13 NMR with annealing. These results combined with relaxation data are interpreted according to a two-component structure largely defined by differences in hydrogen and defect contents. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The HER Oietics of numerous binary and ternary Ni-alloys and composite Ni/metal-euride/C samples were evaluated in aquebus 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The highest HER mass-activity was observed for Ni-Cr materials which exhibit metallic Ni as well as NiOx and Cr2O3 phases as determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis. The onset of the HER is significantly improved compared to munerous binary dor ternary Ni-alloys, inCluding Ni Mg materials. It is likely that at adjacent Ni/NiOx sites, the oxide acts as a sink for OHads, while the metallic Ni acts as a, sink for the H-ads, intermediate of the HER, thus minimizing the high activation energy of hydrogen evolution via water reduction. This is confirmed by in situ XAS studies that show that the synergistic HER enhancement is due to NiO content and that the Cr2O3 appears to stabilize the composite NiO component-under HER conditions (where NiOx would typically be reduced to metallic Ni-0). Furthermore, in contrast to Pt, the Ni(O-x)/Cr2O3 catalyst appears resistant to poisoning by the anion.exchange ionomer (AEI), a serloua consideration when applied to an anionic polymer electrolyte interface. Furthermore, we report a: detailed model of the double layer interface which helps explain the observed ensemble effect in the presence of AEI.									96	2	0	0	1	0	98			1932-7447			WOS:000351189100026	26191118

INSECTES SOCIAUX				60	4			419	435		10.1007/s00040-013-0313-7				NOV 2013	2013	In the animal kingdom, living in group is driven by a tradeoff between the costs and the benefits of this way of life. This review focuses especially on the benefits of aggregation and crowding in woodlice (Crustacea: Isopoda: Oniscidea). Indeed, woodlice are well known to live in groups. Their aggregation behavior, as described in the early works of Allee, is regarded as a mechanism to prevent desiccation to which woodlice are extremely sensitive. However, it is now clear that there are additional benefits to aggregation in woodlice. Hence, this review addresses not only the limitation of water loss as the main factor explaining aggregation patterns, but also alternative explanations as reduction of oxygen consumption, increase in body growth, biotic stimuli for reproduction, better access to mates, possible shared defenses against predators, promotion of coprophagy as a secondary food source, sheltering behavior and the acquisition of internal symbionts. In addition, we place woodlice in the context of a terrestrialization process and propose that woodlice-the only suborder of Crustacea almost entirely composed of strictly terrestrial species-are a model taxon for studying the evolution of sociality through the transition from water to land. Further, we discuss other ultimate causes of aggregation preserved in terrestrial isopods in light of those explained in aquatic isopods and under the concept of exaptation. This knowledge could help understand, in this and other taxa, how the spatial closeness between conspecifics may promote the colonization of new environments and nonphysiological responses to climatic constraints.									39	1	0	0	36	0	39			0020-1812	1420-9098		WOS:000325707200002

This so-called 'mass-dependent' fractionation is well documented in terrestrial minerals(1,2). Evidence for 'mass- independent' fractionation (Delta(17)O = delta(17)O-0.52 delta(18)O), where deviation from this tight relationship occurs, has so far been found only in meteoritic material and a few terrestrial atmospheric substances(3). In the rock record it is thought that oxygen isotopes have followed a mass-dependent relationship for at least the past 3.7 billion years (ref. 4), and no exception to this has been encountered for terrestrial solids(5). Here, however, we report oxygen-isotope values of two massive sulphate mineral deposits, which formed in surface environments on the Earth but show large isotopic anomalies (Delta(17)O up to 4.6 parts per thousand). These massive sulphate deposits are gypcretes from the central Namib Desert and the sulphate-bearing Miocene volcanic ash-beds in North America. The source of this isotope anomaly might be related to sulphur oxidation reactions in the atmosphere and therefore enable tracing of such oxidation. These findings also support the possibility of a chemical origin of variable isotope anomalies on other planets, such as Mars(6).									86	8	0	0	14	0	93			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000088221100044	10910354

In this work, ultrafine S-doped RuP nanoparticles homogeneously embedded in a N, P, and S-codoped carbon sheet (S-RuP@NPSC) is synthesized by pyrolysis of poly(cyclotriphosphazene-co-4,4 '-sulfonyldiphenol) (PZS) as the source of C/N/S/P. The bondings between Ru and N, P, S in PZS are regulated to synthesize RuS2(800 degrees C) and S-RuP (900 degrees C) by different calcination temperatures. The S-RuP@NPSC with low Ru loading of 0.8 wt% with abundant active catalytic sites possesses high utilization of Ru, the mass catalytic activity is 22.88 times than 20 wt% Pt/C with the overpotential of 250 mV. Density functional theory calculation confirms that the surface Ru (-0.18 eV) and P (0.05 eV) are catalytic active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and the according charge redistribution of Ru is regulated by S and P with reverse electronegativity and electron-donor property to induce a synergistically enhanced reactivity toward the HER. This work provides a rational method to regulate the bonding and charge distribution of Ru-based electrocatalysts by reacting macromolecules with multielement of C/N/S/P with Ru.									41	2	0	0	4	0	41				2198-3844		WOS:000550443600001	32995134

Herein, we report the H-2 evolution performance of gallium doped TiO2 photocatalysts with varying degrees of Ga dopant. The gallium(III) ions induced significant changes in the structural, textural and electronic properties of TiO2 nanoparticles, resulting in remarkably enhanced photocatalytic activity and good stability for H-2 production. Ga3+ ions can act as hole traps that enable a large number of excited electrons to migrate towards the TiO2 surface, thereby facilitating electron transfer and charge separation. Additionally, the cationic dopant and its induced defects might introduce a mid-gap state, promoting electron migration and prolonging the lifetime of charge carrier pairs. We have discovered that the optimal Ga dopant concentration was 3.125 at% and that the incorporation of platinum (0.5 wt%) as a co-catalyst further improved the H-2 evolution rate up to 5722 mmol g(-1) h(-1). Pt not only acts as an electron sink, drastically increasing the electron/hole pair lifetime, but it also creates an intimate contact at the heterojunction between Pt and Ga-TiO2, thus improving the interfacial electron transfer process. These catalyst design strategies provide new ways of designing transition metal photocatalysts that improve green fuel production from renewable solar energy and water.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000423019600078	29302663	
J	Copi, CJ								A stochastic approach to chemical evolution								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				487	2			704	718		10.1086/304627				OCT 1 1997	1997	Observations of elemental abundances in the Galaxy have repeatedly shown an intrinsic scatter as a function of time and metallicity. The standard approach to chemical evolution does not attempt to address this scatter in abundances since only the mean evolution is followed. In this work, the scatter is addressed via a stochastic approach to solving chemical evolution models. Three simple chemical evolution scenarios are studied using this stochastic approach: a closed box model, an infall model, and an outflow model. These models are solved for the solar neighborhood in a Monte Carlo fashion. The evolutionary history of one particular region is determined randomly based on the star formation rate and the initial mass function. Following the evolution in an ensemble of such regions leads to the predicted spread in abundances expected, based solely on different evolutionary histories of otherwise identical regions. In this work, 13 isotopes are followed, including the light elements, the CNO elements, a few alpha-elements, and iron. It is found that the predicted spread in abundances for a 10(5) M. region is in good agreement with observations for the alpha-elements. For CN, the agreement is not as good, perhaps indicating the need for more physics input for low-mass stellar evolution. Similarly for the light elements, the predicted scatter is quite small, which is in contradiction to the observations of He-3 in H II regions. The models are tuned for the solar neighborhood so that good agreement with H II regions is not expected. This has important implications for low-mass stellar evolution and on using chemical evolution to determine the primordial light-element abundances in order to test big bang nucleosynthesis.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:A1997YA04000022

Windsor longpod and snap bean) plants, etiolated during germination, were exposed to intermittent light (2 min light every 2 hr) for up to 68 hr and then transferred to continuous white light. On transfer of the plants to continuous light (100 photons mu mol m(-2) s(-1), 24 degreesC), the quantum yield of oxygen evolution increased two-fold in about 30 hr. The chlorophyll content per unit leaf area or unit fresh weight increased dramatically, but the fresh weight per unit leaf area was relatively constant. The changes were expressed on the basis of fresh weight or leaf area. On this basis, the contents of photosystem (PS) I and II increased in continuous light, by a factor of 3 and 8, respectively. While the chlorophyll b content and the contents of apoproteins of light-harvesting chlorophyll-protein complexes (LHCIIb, CP29, CP26 and CP24) increased markedly, neither the total carotenoid content nor the de-epoxidation state of the xanthophylls [ratio of zeaxanthin(Z) + antheraxanthin(A) to (Z+ A + violaxanthin) was about 0.4)] responded significantly on transfer to continuous light. The fast rise of the flash-induced electrochromic signal (Delta A518) was well correlated with the increases in PS I and PS II reaction centres,and with chlorophyll b and total carotenoid contents. The increase in the quantum yield of oxygen evolution during greening in continuous light is attributed to a more balanced distribution of excitation energy between the two photosystems, facilitated by the increased number of PS II units, the increased antenna size of each unit and the enhancement of grana formation. The chloroplast in intermittent light was found to contain abundant xanthophyll cycle pigments and the psbS gene product, presumably adequate for photoprotection in continuous light as soon as chlorophyll a/b- protein complexes are synthesized. The results suggest that greening in continuous light is accompanied by adjustments that include enhanced quantum efficiency of photosynthesis and development of a capacity for harmless dissipation of excess excitation energy.									17	0	0	0	16	0	17			0301-1208	0975-0959		WOS:000167019800006	11355626

Consistently, these studies show evidence for a slowing of the final, oxygen-releasing step, S-3 (-->) S-0, of the catalytic cycle. To a degree, some of this work also shows a slowing of the earlier S-state transitions. To study these processes in more detail, we have investigated the effect of replacing Ca2+ with Sr2+ on the rates of the S-state transitions by using time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance. The results show a slowdown of the last transition in the cycle, consistent with a report from Boussac et al. [Boussac, A., Setif, P., and Rutherford, A. W. (1992) Biochemistry-31, 1224-1234], and of the earlier S-state transitions as well, which suggests that a common molecular mechanism is at work and that Sr2+ is less effective than Ca2+ in supporting it. While the oxidation of Y-z by P-680(+) has been extensively studied and can be understood within the context of nonadiabatic electron tunneling combined with rapid, non-rate-limiting proton transfer in the hole-system [Tommos, C., and Babcock, G. T. (2000) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1458, 199], the reduction of Y-z(.) by the Mn cluster cannot be described effectively by a nonadiabatic electron-transfer formalism. This indicates that this reaction is rate limited by processes other than electron tunneling. We discuss our results for Y-z(.) reduction and those of others for the activation parameters (E-a, A, KIE, and rates) associated with this process, in terms of both sequential and concerted proton-coupled, electron transfer. Our analysis indicates that concerted hydrogen-atom transfer processes best explain the observed characteristics of the S-state advances.									45	0	0	0	32	0	45			0006-2960			WOS:000166070000064	11123952

Modular electro-chemical synthesis (ModES) using a redox reservoir (RR) offers a promising membrane-free approach to improve energy efficiency and reduce waste through the pairing of multiple independent oxidative and reductive half-reactions; however, undesired ion-imbalance and induced pH changes in the existing ModES process limit sustained production. Here we present Ni(OH)(2) as a heterogeneous RR that can selectively store and transport the hydroxide ions involved in the target half-reactions by reversible conversion with NiOOH to enable an ion-balanced ModES of two common disinfectants, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium hypochlorite (NaClO). This hydroxide-balanced ModES realizes stable operation without appreciable pH swing to accumulate practically useful concentrations of H2O2 and NaClO up to 251 and 481 ppm, respectively. These results illustrate additional design principles for electrosynthesis without sacrificial auxiliary reactions and the need for ion-selective RRs for modular electrochemical manufacturing.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2374-7943	2374-7951		WOS:000744186200016	34963900

In all the models detailed nucleosynthesis prescriptions from supernovae of all types and low- and intermediate-mass stars are taken into account. We start by computing chemical evolution models for the Milky Way with different stellar nucleosynthesis prescriptions. Then, a comparison between model results and 'key' observational constraints allows us to choose the best set of stellar yields. Once the best set of yields is identified for the Milky Way, we apply the same nucleosynthesis prescriptions to other spirals (in particular M101) and dwarf irregular galaxies. We compare our model predictions with the [C,N,O/Fe] versus [Fe/H], log(C/O) versus 12 + log(O/H), log(N/O) versus 12+ log(O/H) and [C/O] versus [Fe/H] relations observed in the solar vicinity and draw the following conclusions. (i) There is no need to invoke strong stellar winds in massive stars in order to explain the evolution of the C/O ratio, as often claimed in the literature. (ii) The predicted [O/Fe] ratio as a function of metallicity is in very good agreement with the most recent data available for the solar vicinity, especially for halo stars. This fact again suggests that the oxygen stellar yields in massive stars computed by either Woosley & Weaver or Thielemann, Nomoto & Hashimoto without taking into account mass loss, reproduce the observations well. (iii) We predict that the gap observed in the [Fe/O] versus [O/H] at [O/H]similar to-0.3 dex should be observed also in C/O versus O/H. The existence of such a gap is predicted by our model for the Milky Way and is caused by a halt in the star formation between the end of the thick disc and the beginning of the thin disc phase. Such a halt is produced by the adopted threshold gas density for the star formation rate. (iv) This threshold is also responsible for the prediction of a very slow chemical enrichment between the time of formation of the solar system (4.5 Gyr ago) and the present time, in agreement with new abundance measurements. (v) The chemical evolution models for dwarf irregulars and spirals, adopting the same nucleosynthesis prescriptions of the best model for the solar neighbourhood, well reproduce the available constraints for these objects. (vi) By taking into account the results obtained for all the studied galaxies (Milky Way, M101, dwarf galaxies and DLAs) we conclude that there is no need for claiming a strong primary component of N produced in massive stars (M > 10 M-circle dot ). (vii) Moreover, there is a strong indication that C and N are mainly produced in low- and intermediate-mass stars, at variance with recent suggestions that most of the C should come from massive stars. In particular, intermediate-mass stars with masses between 4 and 8 M-circle dot contribute mostly to N (both primary and secondary) whereas those with masses between 1 and 3 M-circle dot contribute mostly to C. At the same time, our results suggest that the C yields computed for massive stars, without taking into account stellar rotation, are underestimated and should be at least a factor of 3 larger than the current values.									198	2	0	0	0	1	200			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000180741300009

The use of ethanol, an economic and safe precursor, for the fast growth of graphene on copper by a home-built CVD set-up was analysed. Full coverage of uniform single-layer graphene with high crystalline quality was found on aOE (c) 100 > textured Cu foils in just 30 s. The nucleation density of graphene islands was found to be independent of facets but the island shape showed facet dependence. Diamond-like islands were observed on Cu(100) facets while random shaped islands were seen on other facets. The last observation is discussed in terms of a competition between graphene-island growth and its relaxation rate on different facets. On Cu(100) slower island growth as compared to its relaxation leads to equilibrium shapes as opposed to other facets. Further, an observed evolution in graphene contrast in electron micrographs with time on different facets was discussed in terms of oxygen diffusion between graphene and Cu.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0250-4707	0973-7669		WOS:000367599000009

These proteins are particularly resistant, and maintain function, under a variety of cellular conditions such as pH extremes and elevated temperatures. Green fluorescent proteins are also abundant in several groups of marine invertebrates including reef-forming corals. While molecular oxygen is required for the post-translational maturation of the protein, mature GFPs are found in corals where hyperoxia and reactive oxygen species (ROS) occur due to the photosynthetic activity of algal symbionts. In vitro spin trapping electron paramagnetic resonance and spectrophotometric assays of superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like enzyme activity show that wild type GFP from the hydromedusa, Aequorea victoria, quenches superoxide radicals (O-2(center dot-)) and exhibits SOD-like activity by competing with cytochrome c for reaction with O-2(center dot-). When exposed to high amounts of O-2(center dot-) the SOD-like activity and protein structure of GFP are altered without significant changes to the fluorescent properties of the protein. Because of the distribution of fluorescent proteins in both the epithelial and gastrodermal cells of reef-forming corals we propose that GFP, and possibly other fluorescent proteins, can provide supplementary antioxidant protection.

This effect has been studied by means of impedance spectroscopy (IS). Insulating grain boundary barrier layers were detected also without interaction with Ni-inner electrodes, as they are applied in multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs). In moist firing atmospheres H2O vapor was found to react with oxygen vacancies, forming positively charged hydroxyl defects (OH)(O)(center dot) on regular oxygen sites in the crystal lattice. Hopping of protonic defects is supposed to raise the ionic conductivity. Re-oxidation in dry gas mixtures of O-2 and N-2, however, desorbs water from the dielectric material and improves the IR. DC-field stress heavily degrades the grain boundary barriers. Protons in the dielectric material largely accelerate the electrical degradation. Hydroxyl defects are also considered to be responsible for alterations of the dielectric temperature characteristics at the Curie point. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a series of covalent bonding oxygen-doped carbon nitride/graphitic carbon nitride hybrids (O-CN/CN) have been synthesized via solvothermal treatment using cyanuric chloride, cyanuric acid (derived from hydrolysis of cyanuric chloride) and urea-derived graphitic carbon nitride as precursors. In O-CN/CN hybrids, guest O-CN was covalently bonded with incomplete polycondensation -NHx derived from the host CN surface as verified by XRD, FT-IR, XPS and solid-state C-13 MAS NMR spectra. With assistance of Pt co-catalyst, the most efficient O-CN/CN-3 photocatalyst showed the highest H-2 generation rate at 6.97 mmol g(-1)h(-1) under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm) by 12.4 times as that of pristine CN (0.56 mmol g(-1)h(-1)). Moreover, the apparent quantum yield (AQY) was estimated as 21.4% at 425 nm irradiation for O-CN/CN-3. The improved photocatalytic performance was ascribed to the extended visible light absorption, the inhibited photo-induced charge carrier recombination and rapid charge carriers transfer that were confirmed by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, photoluminescence spectra, transient photocurrent responses, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity displayed unnoticeable deactivation within five recycles, further verifying that O-CN/CN hybrids were stable for visible-light-driven H-2 evolution. This present work promotes new insights into Z-scheme heterojunction engineering for graphitic carbon nitride.									92	0	0	0	8	0	92			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000504404800031

We observed experimentally that successive sodic and potassic alterations of feldspar can occur via a single self-evolved, originally Na-only, hydrothermal fluid. At 600 degrees C, 2kbar, sanidine ((K,Na)AlSi3O8) reacted rapidly with a NaCl fluid to form albite (NaAlSi3O8); over time, some of this albite was replaced by K-feldspar (KAlSi3O8), in contrast to predictions from equilibrium reaction modelling. Fluorine accelerated the process, resulting in near-complete back-replacement of albite within 1 day. These findings reveal that potassic alteration can be triggered by Na-rich fluids, indicating that pervasive sequential sodic and potassic alterations associated with mineralization in some of the world's largest ore deposits may not necessarily reflect externally-driven changes in fluid alkali contents. Here, we show that these reactions are promoted at the micro-scale by a self-evolving, kinetically-driven process; such positive feedbacks between equilibrium and kinetic factors may be essential in driving pervasive mineral transformations. This paper reveals that potassic alteration can be triggered by Na-rich fluids, indicating that pervasive sequential sodic and potassic alterations associated with mineralization in some of the world's largest ore deposits may not necessarily reflect externally-driven changes in fluid alkali contents.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2041-1723			WOS:000679964000005	34290248

In this study, the C3N4-modified Ti/PbO(2)electrode with tunable hydrophobic characteristics is fabricated by a facile electrodeposition process. It is found that the introduction of C(3)N(4)into the PbO(2)films changed the morphology, surface hydrophilicity, and hydrophobicity of the electrode, which promotes the photoelectrochemical active areas, generating efficiency of hydroxyl radicals. In addition, introducing C(3)N(4)into PbO(2)coating can enhance oxygen evolution potential and carrier density of PbO2. Photoelectrocatalytic degradation experiments show that the addition of C(3)N(4)can further improve the catalytic performance of PbO(2)and there exists a significant photoelectric synergism in photoelectrocatalytic process. These results demonstrate that the combination of reasonable surface hydrophobic characteristics and photoelectrocatalytic is a prospective approach for wastewater treatment.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000542797000013

We review the physics of the early universe, the proton to neutron ratio influence in the observed helium abundance, reaction networks, the formation of elements up to beryllium, the inhomogeneous Big Bang model, and the Big Bang nucleosynthesis constraints on cosmological models. Attention is paid to element production in stars, together with the details of the pp chain, the pp reaction, He-3 formation and destruction, electron capture on Be-7, the importance of B-8 formation and its relation to solar neutrinos, and neutrino oscillations. Nucleosynthesis in massive stars is also reviewed, with focus on the CNO cycle and its hot companion cycle, the rp-process, triple-alpha capture, and red giants and AGB stars. The stellar burning of carbon, neon, oxygen, and silicon is presented in a separate section, as well as the slow and rapid nucleon capture processes and the importance of medium modifications due to electrons also for pycnonuclear reactions. The nucleosynthesis in cataclysmic events such as in novae, X-ray bursters and in core-collapse supernovae, the role of neutrinos, and the supernova radioactivity and light-curve is further discussed, as well as the structure of neutron stars and its equation of state.

However, the effective synthesis of such bulk graphene reinforced magnesium (Mg) composites remains challenging because of the poor interfacial bonding and the aggregation of GNS. Here, GNS possessing about 12 at. % residual oxygen (similar to 7: 1 C/O ratio) was synthesized by a thermal reduction method. These residual oxygen in GNS is beneficial to increase the interfacial bonding between GNS and the matrix of alpha-Mg by MgO nanoparticles, which synthesized through the occurrence of a reaction between the residual oxygen and a-Mg in the composites. TEM analysis reveals that the in-situ synthesized MgO nanoparticles can significantly improve the interfacial bonding between GNS and a-Mg owing to the formation of semi-coherent interface of MgO/alpha-Mg and the distortion area bonding interface of GNS/MgO. By filling 0.5 wt. % of GNS, the yield strength and elongation of the composite increased by 76.2% and 24.3%, respectively as compared to the matrix alloy. The significant improvement in mechanical properties of the composites is mainly due to the grain refinement, strong interfacial bonding and dislocation strengthening. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, Co@CoO heterointerface catalysts are prepared via the controlled reduction of CoO nanosheets. The experimental quantifications of lattice strain and oxygen vacancy concentration on CoO, as well as the charge transfer across the Co-CoO interface are all linearly correlated to the catalytic activity toward the aqueous phase reforming of formaldehyde to produce hydrogen. Mechanistic investigations by spectroscopic measurements and density functional theory calculations elucidate the bifunctional nature of the oxygen-vacancy-rich Co-CoO interfaces, where the Co and the CoO sites are responsible for C-H bond cleavage and O-H activation, respectively. Optimal catalytic activity is achieved by the sample reduced at 350 degrees C, Co@CoO-350 which exhibits the maximum concentration of Co-CoO interfaces, the maximum concentration of oxygen vacancies, a lattice strain of 5.2% in CoO, and the highest aqueous phase formaldehyde reforming turnover frequency of 50.4 h(-1) at room temperature. This work provides not only new insights into the strain-vacancy-activity relationship at bifunctional catalytic interfaces, but also a facile synthetic approach to prepare heterostructures with highly tunable catalytic activities.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000705985300001	34636132

Herein, a series of noble metal doped ultra-small size (4 nm) M-Ni/NiO nanoparticles supported on CNT are rationally designed by a solvent-free microwave reduction method that is fast (60 s), simple, includes no surfactants, extensive (>1 g), and has high yield (82.7%). The Ir-Ni/NiO@CNT has superior performance with a low overpotential of 24.6 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, the turnover frequency (TOF) value up to 2.51 s(-1) and the exchange current density reaches 4.34 mA cm(-2), indicating that the catalyst has better intrinsic catalytic activity. It is further proved by density functional theory (DFT) that the NiO surface is conducive to the adsorption of OH* in the Volmer step while the Ni is inclined to adsorb H*, which synergistically promotes the water-splitting reaction, thereby increasing the catalytic rate of HER. It is believed that this work will provide valuable contributions and inspirations toward the large-scale production of high-performance Ni-based electrocatalysts for HER.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000751804400001	35128776

Here, layered Ni3S2/Ag/Ni3S2(N2A1) nanosheets have been grown directly on carbon clothviaa facile alternating electrodeposition method. Compared to the electrocatalyst Ni3S2/Ag(N1A1) with Ag as the innermost layer, the Ag/Ni3S2(A1N1) catalyst with Ni(3)S(2)nanosheets as the initial layer takes greater advantage of the low impedance for water splitting. Benefitting from the coexistence of different morphologies of Ni3S2, quasi-three-dimensional layered N2A1 exhibits excellent catalytic activity and stability toward OER, with an overpotential of 187 mV for 10 mA center dot cm(-2). Notably, based on the temperature-dependent measurement, the lower activation energy (E-a) of N2A1 is observed for the superior OER process. The roles of Ag in N2A1 were uncovered as affecting charge rearrangement, increasing electron transfer, and controlling morphology of Ni3S2.									18	0	0	0	2	0	18			2052-1553			WOS:000573315100011

Like the Li-ion battery industry, a big catch is often neglected regarding the environmentally-friendly preparation of electrode materials and the treatment of end-of-life electrode. The potential release of hazards poses a new challenge to sustainable development. Herein we designed a series of amorphous CoxM1-xWOy (M = Fe, Ni, Cu and Zn) OER catalyst that enabled the implementation of a life-cycle consideration. The metal dissolution from the catalyst in service was controlled in an "activation" step. The spent catalysts and the discharged metal ions from the synthesis and activation steps were recycled with high efficiency to make new batches of catalysts, delivering equally excellent OER activity of 253 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2). This materials design and synthesis consideration throughout the life cycle might inspire other scientists to develop "greener" yet high-performance materials for sustainable applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000712107500004

This reaction is known to take place in the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) incorporating four manganese, one calcium and one chloride cofactors, that is light-driven to cycle four intermediates, designated So through S-4, to produce four protons, five electrons and lastly one molecular oxygen, for indispensable resources in biosphere. Recent advancements of X-ray crystallography models established the existence of a catalytic Mn4Ca cluster ligated by seven protein amino acids, but its functional structure is not yet resolved. The O-18 exchange rates of two substrate water molecules were recently measured for four S-i-state samples (i=0-3) leading to O-34(2) and O-36(2), formations, revealing asymmetric substrate binding sites significantly depending on the S-i-state. In this paper, we present a chemically complete model for the Mn4Ca cluster and its surrounding enzyme field, which we found out from some possible models by using the hybrid density functional theoretic geometry optimization method to confirm good agreements with the 3.0 angstrom resolution PSII model [B. Loll, J. Kem, W. Saenger, A. Zouni, J. Biesiadka, Nature 438 (2005) 1040-1044] and the S-state dependence of O-18 exchange rates [W Hillier and T. Wydrzynski, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 6 (2004) 4882-4889]. Furthermore, we have verified that two substrate water molecules are bound to asymmetric cis-positions on the terminal Mn ion being triply bridged (p-oxo, lt-carboxylato, and a hydrogen bond) to the Mn3CaO3(OH) core, by developing a generalized theory of O-18 exchange kinetics in OEC to obtain an experimental evidence for the cross exchange pathway from the slow to the fast exchange process. Some important experimental data will be discussed in terms of this model and its possible tautomers, to suggest that a cofactor, Cl- ion, may be bound to CP43-Arg357 nearby Ca2+ ion and that D1-His337 may be used to trap a released proton only in the S-2-state.

The morphology and phase evolution of as-obtained fibers are characterized by TG-DTA, XRD, FT-IR and SEM, respectively. Typical ceramic fiber diameter is 100-200 nm, with length exceeding tens of microns. Rapid heating the nanofiber cathode at 1000 degrees C for 15 min results in homogeneous porous microstructure and good contact with the CGO electrolyte. EIS analysis of the nanofiber electrode gives a polarization resistance of 0.26 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C in air, two times smaller than that from the powder cathode with the same composition. The excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the well constructed microstructure of the fiber cathode, which can promote surface oxygen diffusion or adsorption processes on the cathode.

The orthorhombic Pbnm structure of the pure LaFeO3 powder was confirmed by X-ray diffraction. However, there was a changing tendency from the orthorhombic Pbnm structure into the rhombohedral R3c structure with the increase in Bi-doping. The structural and symmetric change of Bi-doped LaFeO3 samples was further verified by the Raman spectra which changed from fundamental 5 modes into 7 modes. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) revealed that more oxygen vacancies, Fe3+ and Fe4+, existed in Bi-doped LaFeO3 sample. Detailed CV, LSV and EIS analyses had provided conclusive evidence that the oxygen vacancy Fe3+ and Fe4+ played an important contribution to the electrocatalytic activity. The best ORR catalytic effect was observed in La0.85Bi0.15FeO3 catalyst. These results suggest that the Bi-doping is a significative effort to enhance the activities of perovskite electrocatalysts.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000460069500005

In this work, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) microtubes with tunable N-vacancy concentrations were controllably fabricated using an in situ soft-chemical method. The morphological evolution of C3N4 from the bulk to the porous tubular architecture, is discussed in detail with the aid of time-resolved hydrothermal experiments. We found that the NO removal ratio and apparent reaction rate constant of the g-C3N4 microtubes were 1.8 and 2.6 times higher than those of pristine g-C3N4, respectively. By combining detailed experimental characterization and density functional theory calculations, the effects of N-vacancies in the g-C3N4 microtubes on O-2 and NO adsorption activation, electron capture, and electronic structure were systematically investigated. These results demonstrate that surface N-vacancies act as specific sites for the adsorption activation of reactants and photoinduced electron capture, while enhancing the light-absorbing capability of g-C3N4. Moreover, the porous wall structures of the as-prepared g-C3N4 microtubes facilitate the diffusion of reactants, and their tubular architectures favor the oriented transfer of charge carriers. The intermediates formed during photocatalytic NO removal processes were identified by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, and different reaction pathways over pristine and N-deficient g-C3N4 are proposed. This study provides a feasible strategy for air pollution control over g-C3N4 by introducing N-vacancy and porous tubular architecture simultaneously.									134	9	0	0	32	0	136			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000462260000023	30807084

The main processes that occurred in the Sauvignon blanc wines during bottle ageing were hydrolysis of 3MHA and other acetate esters, hydrolysis of ethyl esters of fatty acids, and the formation of ethyl esters of branched acids. The kinetic parameters of ester hydrolysis, including reaction rate constants and activation energies, were determined, which allow prediction of future wine composition based upon storage temperature and time. It was found that 3MHA had the highest reaction rate constant, meaning that this compound is the most unstable, particularly at higher storage temperatures, and that it disappeared very fast during wine storage.

The films were deposited on (001) sapphire substrates at 400 A degrees C, at two different oxygen pressures (0 center dot 3 and 0 center dot 4 mbar) and two different target-substrate distances (30 and 40 mm). It is observed that in order to obtain good quality in the photoluminescence of the films, associated with oxygen stoichiometry, it is needed to maximize the time during which the plasma remains in contact with the growing film (plasma residence time), which is achieved by selecting suitable combinations of oxygen pressures and target to substrate distances. It is also discussed that for the growth parameters used, the higher probability for ZnO films growth results from the oxidation of Zn deposited on the substrate and such process takes place during the time that the plasma is in contact with the substrate. Moreover, it is observed that maximizing the plasma residence time over the growing film reduces the rate of material deposition, favouring the surface diffusion of adatoms, which favours both Zn-O reaction and grain growth.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0250-4707	0973-7669		WOS:000320280500006		
J	Ren Chunxing; Li Xiaoxia; Guo Li								Reaction Mechanisms in the Thermal Decomposition of CL-20 Revealed by ReaxFF Molecular Dynamics Simulations								ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA				34	10			1151	1162		10.3866/PKU.WHXB201802261				2018	2018	The thermal decomposition of condensed CL-20 was investigated using reactive force field molecular dynamics (ReaxFF MD) simulations of a super cell containing 128 CL-20 molecules at 800-3000 K. The VARxMD code previously developed by our group is used for detailed reaction analysis. Various intermediates and comprehensive reaction pathways in the thermal decomposition of CL-20 were obtained. Nitrogen oxides are the major initial decomposition products, generated in a sequence of NO2, NO3, NO, and N2O. NO2 is the most abundant primary product and is gradually consumed in subsequent secondary reactions to form other nitrogen oxides. NO3 is the second most abundant intermediate in the early stages of CL-20 thermolysis. However, it is unstable and quickly decomposes at high temperatures, while other nitrogen oxides remain. At all temperatures, the unimolecular pathways of N-NO2 bond cleavage and ring-opening C-N bond scission dominate the initial decomposition of condensed CL-20. The cleavage of the N-NO2 bond is greatly enhanced at high temperatures, but scission of the C-N bond is not as favorable. A bimolecular pathway of oxygen-abstraction by NO2 to generate NO3 is observed in the initial decomposition steps of CL-20, which should be considered as one of the major pathways for CL-20 decomposition at low temperatures. After the initiation of CL-20 decomposition, fragments with different ring structures are formed from a series of bond-breaking reactions. Analysis of the ring structure evolution indicates that the pyrazine derivatives of fused tricycles and bicycles are early intermediates in the decomposition process, which further decompose to single ring pyrazine. Pyrazine is the most stable ring structure obtained in the simulations of CL-20 thermolysis, supporting the proposed existence of pyrazine in Py-GC/MS experiments. The single imidazole ring is unstable and decomposes quickly in the early stages of CL-20 thermolysis. Many C-4 and C-2 intermediates are observed after the initial fragmentation, but eventually convert into stable products. The distribution of the final products (N-2, H2O, CO2, and H-2) obtained in ReaxFF MD simulation of CL-20 thermolysis at 3000 K quantitatively agrees with the results of the CL-20 detonation experiment. The comprehensive understanding of CL-20 thermolysis obtained through this study suggests that ReaxFF MD simulation, combined with the reaction analysis capability of VARxMD, would be a promising method for obtaining deeper insight into the complex chemistry of energetic materials exposed to thermal stimuli.									22	6	0	0	0	0	26			1000-6818			WOS:000431609600008

These electrocatalysts can be considered as candidate cathode and anode materials for anion-exchange membrane (AEM) alkaline alcohol fuel cells. A series of Ni-doped cobalt oxide (NixCo3-xO4) hierarchical nanostructures composed of one-dimensional nanorods was prepared by an inexpensive hydrothermal method. X-ray diffraction patterns showed that the NixCo3-xO4 crystallized in a cubic spinet phase. The electrochemical performance of the catalysts was investigated using a conventional cyclic vottammetry technique. The etectrocatalytic behaviour of the NixCo3-xO4 hierarchical nanostructures was compared with the behaviour of Co3O4 and Co0.33Ni0.67O. The synergistic behaviour of the Ni in the NixCo3-xO4 nanostructures was established with respect to the Ni content. NixCo3-xO4 hierarchical nanostructures show a better catalytic behaviour than Co3O4 and Co0.33Ni0.67O. Although the NixCo3-xO4 compositions all showed good catalytic behaviour, Ni1Co2O4 was identified as a superior bifunctional electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction and methanol oxidation reactions in alkaline media. The effect of the Ni content on the electrocatalytic properties of the NixCo3-xO4 hierarchical nanostructures was clearly shown. The use of these etectrocatalysts based on non-precious metals could have a commercial impact on the development of non-platinum electrocatatysts for application in AEM alkaline alcohol fuel cells.									72	3	0	0	4	0	72			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000340217900040	24990285

However, it remains a challenge to overcome short-time deactivation in that active site of Ti3+ coordinated with high-electronegative oxygen atom usually aggravates the tendency to high valence state. Herein, we design a unique configuration of P3+-O-v-Ti3+ in TiO2-x nanotube array via utilizing PH3 to synchronize the reaction during the transformation from amorphous TiO2 to anatase detective TiO2 (TiO2-x). The performance results and DFT simulations reveal that the 3 s orbital (M shell) of P3+ in PT1 has a delocalized electron pair and significantly changes the valence electron configuration in 3d orbital of Ti3+ in the configuration P3+-O-v-Ti3+, thus regulating its electronic structure and forming a midgap state at the band gap. The unique structure of P3+-O-v-Ti3+ allows Ti3+ to exist in a more stable form via modulating electronic structure and constructing a new channel for electron transfer, resulting in a remarkable photoelectrocatalytic performance and an unprecedented stability with the lifetime of over 39632 h in 1 M NaClO4 electrolyte at 1 mA/cm(2). This work not only provides an efficient way to prepare the stable photoelectrodes but paves the way to identify the roles of phosphorus with different valence states in catalytic activity and stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000774912200002

Three different ligands, with a decreasing order of coordinating ability as: 4-mercaptopyridine (MPy) > 4-aminothiolphenol (APT) > 4-mercaptobenzonitrile (MBN) are used and a maximum difference in ORR onset potential of 80 mV is observed between the MPy (highest onset potential) and MBN systems (lowest onset potential). The ORR activity of TMPPCo increases with the increase in binding strength of the axial ligand. A detailed mechanism study reveals that ORR on the three ligand coordinated TMPPCo systems shares the same 2-electron mechanism with H2O2 as the terminal product. Theoretical calculation into the structure of the ligand coordinated cobalt porphyrins uncovers the variation in atomic charge of the Co(11) center and altered frontier molecular orbital distribution among the three ligand systems. Both properties have great influence on the back-bonding formation between the Co(11) center and O-2 molecules, which has been suggested to be critical toward the O-2 adsorption and subsequent activation process.

In this respect, an impairment of photosynthesis would be responsible for light-dependent generation of toxic reactive oxygen species putatively contributing to death of symbionts and/or host cells. In some Symbiodiniaceae species, alternative photosynthetic electron flows (AEF) have been documented to occur upon a shift to high temperature, possibly contributing to photoprotection and to the balance of energetic ratio between photoproduced ATP and NADPH. By using a combination of in vivo spectrofluorimetric and oximetric techniques, we studied the capacity for electron rerouting toward oxygen and cyclic electron flow (CEF) around photosystem I in eight Symbiodiniaceae in culture belonging to Symbiodinium and Breviolum genera upon an acute shift from 25 to 33 degrees C. CEF capacity was determined as the kinetic of PSI primary donor P700 re-reduction in the presence of DCMU, a PSII inhibitor. An active oxygen uptake in light was estimated by comparing net oxygen evolution and relative electron transport rate of PSII at different light intensities. Among strains that showed elevated capacity for both AEF, some were thermotolerant while others were thermosensitive. Conversely, in some thermotolerant strains, capacities for these AEF were low upon acute heat stress. A principal component analysis of these results indicates that the long-term heat tolerant/bleached phenotype of cultured Symbiodinium and Breviolum spp. is not correlated with a capacity for different AEF across isolates during early onset of acute heat stress.									10	0	0	0	9	0	10				2296-7745		WOS:000491450600001

Herein, a new strategy is proposed by utilizing the small gas molecule of H-2 as the structure directing agent (SDA) to in situ induce Pt surface segregations over a series of PtNi5-n samples with extremely low Pt doping (Pt/Ni = 0.2). Impressively, the sample of PtNi5-0.3 synthesized under 0.3 MPa H-2 delivers an extremely low overpotential of 26.8 mV (-10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope of 19.2 mV dec(-1), which is superior to most of the previously reported PtxNiy electrocatalysts. This is substantially related to the strong H-2 in situ inducing effect to generate Pt-rich@Ni-rich core-shell nanostructure of PtNi5-0.3 with an ultrahigh Pt surface content of 46%. The specific mechanistic effects of H-2 during the PtNi5-n synthesis process are well illustrated based on the combined experimental and theoretical studies. The density functional theory mechanism simulations further unravel that the evolved active site of PtNi5-n can efficiently reduce the reaction Gibbs free energies; especially for the scenario of PtNi5-0.3, the downward-shifted d band center of the Pt active site significantly reduces the Pt-H bond strength, eventually resulting in the lowest absolute value of Delta G(H).									20	0	0	0	3	0	20			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000612639200001

Herein, using a combined experimental and computational approach, the key elements in the mechanism of the formic acid oxidation reaction on platinum have been completely elucidated, not only for the direct path, through an active intermediate, but also for the CO formation route. The experimental results suggest that the direct oxidation path on platinum takes place in the presence of bidentate adsorbed formate. However, the results reported here provide evidence that this species is not the active intermediate. Monodentate adsorbed formate, whose evolution to the much more favorable bidentate form would be hindered by the presence of neighboring adsorbates, has been found to be the true active intermediate. Moreover, it is found that adsorbed formic acid would have a higher acid constant than in solution, which suggests that adsorbed formate can be originated not only from solution formate but also from formic acid. The CO formation path on platinum can proceed, also from monodentate adsorbed formate, through a dehydrogenation process toward the surface, during which the adsorbate transitions from a Pt-O adsorption mode to a Pt-C one, to form carboxylate. From this last configuration, the C-OH bond is cleaved, on the surface, yielding adsorbed CO and OH. The results and mechanisms reported here provide the best explanation for the whole of the experimental evidence available to date about this reaction, including pH, surface structure and electrode potential effects.									51	1	0	0	0	0	50			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000413734800019

The structural ordering and time evolution of ordered Pt3Fe2 intermetallic core-shell nanocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction that exhibit increased mass activity (228%) and an enhanced catalytic activity (155%) compared to Pt/C has been quantified using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy. These catalysts were found to exhibit a static core-dynamic shell regime wherein, despite treating over 10 000 cycles, there is negligible decrease (9%) in catalytic activity and the ordered Pt3Fe2 core remained virtually intact while the Pt shell suffered a continuous enrichment. The existence of this regime was further confirmed by X-ray diffraction and the compositional analyses using energy-dispersive spectroscopy. With atomic-scale two-dimensional (2-D) surface relaxation mapping, we demonstrate that the Pt atoms on the surface are slightly relaxed with respect to bulk. The cycled nanocatalysts were found to exhibit a greater surface relaxation compared to noncycled catalysts. With 2-D lattice strain mapping, we show that the particle was about -3% strained with respect to pure Pt. While the observed enhancement in their activity is ascribed to such a strained lattice, our findings on the degradation kinetics establish that their extended catalytic durability is attributable to a sustained atomic order.									79	4	0	0	9	0	80			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000322417400053	23773037

The aim of the study is to investigate the resistance of stable isotope compositions of bioapatite carbonate (delta(13)C, delta(18)Oc) and phosphate (delta(18)Op) to isotopic alteration during early diagenesis. Rapid and significant carbon and oxygen isotope changes were observed in the carbonate and phosphate fractions of bone apatite before any detectable change occurred in the crystallinity or organic matter content. These observations indicate that chemical alterations of bone apatite are likely to start within days of death. Enamel crystallites are much more resistant than bone crystallites, but are not exempt of alteration. Non removable carbon and oxygen isotope enrichments were measured in the carbonate phase of bone (50-90%) and enamel (40%) after the acetic acid treatment. This result indicates that a significant part of C-13 and O-18-labelled coming from the aqueous fluid has been durably incorporated into the apatite structure, probably through isotopic exchange or secondary carbonate apatite precipitation. As a result, acetic acid pre-treatments that are currently used to remove exogenous material by selective dissolution, are not adequate to restore pristine delta(13)C and delta(18)Oc values of fossil apatites. Under inorganic conditions, kinetics of oxygen isotope exchange are 10 times faster in carbonate than in phosphate. On the opposite, during biologically-mediated reactions, the kinetics of oxygen isotope exchange between phosphate and water is, at least, from 2 to 15 times faster than between carbonate and water. Enamel is a more suitable material than bone for paleoenviron mental or paleoclimatical reconstructions, but interpretations of delta(18)Op or delta(13)C values must be restricted to specimens for which no or very limited trace of microbial activity can be detected.

First, measurement of matrix shrinkage in composites surface is carried out by Interferometric Microscopy for virgin samples (initial state) and for samples aged under oxygen pressure and air at atmospheric pressure: then, a model based on thermodynamics with Internal Variables and ABAQUS numerical simulations carried out on unidirectional composite realistic samples are employed for inverse identification of thermo-oxidative induced chemical strain and its evolution during conditioning. The identification is performed successfully and validated against chemical shrinkage profiles developing in pure resin systems. The model is then used for calculating thermo-oxidative induced stresses related to chemical shrinkage inelastic strains and for the prediction of the observed fibre/matrix debonding scenario. A Rayleigh-Ritz method is also developed for rapid prediction of matrix shrinkage in composite materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The results showed that the whole electrolysis process of this anode could be divided into three Stages consisting of 'active', 'stable' and 'de-active' ones. In the first two stages, the dissolution of coated oxides was dominated (with preferential loss of IrO2 component). It was found that, in these two stages, the preferential orientations of (110) and (101) planes in IrO2 rutile decreased with the electrolysis time, and that of (002) plane increased, while the preferential orientations remained to be stabilized in the 'de-active' region. This indicated that the loss mechanism of the catalyst coatings was changed. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements showed a slight increase in oxygen evolution reaction resistance of the oxide catalysts while a sharp rise in totally physical impedance of the whole anode in the 'de-active' region. X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) showed that the intensity of TiO2 rutile reflections increased with the electrolysis time, with a sharp increasing in 4 de-active' region. According to the experimental results the degradation mechanism for long service life Ti based coating anodes has been proposed.									8	18	0	0	0	0	20			1000-6818			WOS:000173367900004

Yet the magnitude of the increase in seawater sulfate concentrations over the course of the Eon remains largely unquantified. A rise in seawater sulfate concentrations has been inferred from the increased range of marine sulfide delta S-34 values following the Great Oxidation Event and was induced by two processes: enhanced oxidative weathering of sulfides on land, and the onset of marine sulfur redox cycling. Here we use mass balance and diagenetic reaction-transport models to reconstruct the sulfate concentrations in Proterozoic seawater. We find that sulfate concentrations remained below 400 mu M, and were possibly as low as 100 mu M, throughout much of the Proterozoic. At these low sulfate concentrations, relatively large sulfate-pyrite sulfur isotope differences cannot be explained by sulfate reduction alone and are only possible through oxidative sediment sulfur cycling. This requires oxygen concentrations of at least 10 mu M in shallow Proterozoic seawater, which translates to 1-10% of present atmospheric oxygen concentrations. At these oxygen and sulfate concentrations, the oceans would have been a substantial source of methane to the atmosphere (60-140 Tmol yr(-1)). This methane would have accumulated to high concentrations (more than 25 ppmv) and supported greenhouse warming during much of the Proterozoic Eon, with notable exceptions during the Palaeoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic eras.									48	1	0	0	16	0	49			1752-0894	1752-0908		WOS:000467814100014

LITHOS				246				128	133		10.1016/j.lithos.2015.12.017				MAR 2016	2016	The Great Oxidation Event (GOE) represents the first sustained appearance of free oxygen in Earth's atmosphere. This fundamental event in Earth's history has been dated to approximately 2450 million years ago (Ma), that is, hundreds of millions of years after the appearance of photosynthetic cyanobacteria in the fossil record. A variety of mechanisms have been suggested to explain this time lag between the onset of photosynthesis and atmospheric oxygenation, including orogenesis, changes in the areal extent and distribution of continental shelves, the secular release of hydrogen to space, and methanogenic bacterial stress. Recently, it has been proposed that subaerial volcanism during the early Proterozoic could have provided a large pulse of sulphate to the ancient oceans, the reduction of which liberated the oxygen to drive the GOE. Here we show that the Matachewan Large Igneous Province (LIP), which is partially preserved in Scandinavia and North America, is both exactly coincident with the onset of the GOE, and of sufficient magnitude to be the source of this sulphate release. We therefore propose that the volcanism associated with the emplacement of the Matachewan LIP was a principal driver of the oxygenation of our planet. (C) 2016 The Authors.

First-principles simulations reveal that in-situ S-doping optimizes the charge distribution of Co-N-4 sites and Co-O-C bonds, which reduces the formation energy of *OOH and then improves the ability of oxygen adsorption and hydrogen peroxide desorption. The optimized Co-CoO@NSC exhibits excellent catalytic activity with the overpotential of only 279 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and the halfwave potential of 0.89 V for ORR, outperforming that of most recent reported bifunctional electrocatalysts. Our Co-CoO@NSC catalyst indicates the Delta E (Delta E = E-j =10 (OER) E-1/2 (ORR)) of 0.68 V, which is smaller than the Pt/C + RuO2 system. Flexible solid-state Zn-air battery with Co-CoO@NSC-5 as air-electrode possesses a high power density (87.7 mW cm(-2)) as well as good bending flexibility. The simple synthesis method proposed in our paper is beneficial for inspiring the development for high active and stable bifunctional non-noble metal electrocatalysts in next-generation flexible electronic devices.									29	4	0	0	2	0	30			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000564494200001		
J	Kirschbaum, MUF; Oja, V; Laisk, A								The quantum yield of CO2 fixation is reduced for several minutes after prior exposure to darkness. Exploration of the underlying causes								PLANT BIOLOGY				7	1			58	66		10.1055/s-2004-830476				JAN 2005	2005	Previous work has shown that the apparent quantum yield Of CO2 fixation can be reduced for up to several minutes after prior exposure to darkness. in the work reported here, we investigated this phenomenon more fully and have deduced information about the underlying processes. This was done mainly by concurrent measurements Of O-2 and CO2 exchange in an oxygen-free atmosphere. Measurements of O-2 evolution indicated that photochemical efficiency was not lost through dark adaptation, and that O-2 evolution could proceed immediately at high rates provided that there were reducible pools of photosynthetic intermediates. Part of the delay in reaching the full quantum yield Of CO2 fixation could be attributed to the need to build up pools of photosynthetic intermediates to high enough levels to support steady rates Of CO2 fixation. There was no evidence that Rubisco inactivation contributed towards delayed CO2 uptake (under measurement conditions of low light). However, we obtained evidence that an enzyme in the reaction path between triose phosphates and RuBP must become completely inactivated in the dark. As a consequence, in dark-adapted leaves, a large amount of triose phosphates were exported from the chloroplast over the first minute of light rather than being converted to RuBP for CO2 fixation. That pattern was not observed if the pre-incubation light level was increased to just 3-5 mumol quanta m(-2) s(-1). The findings from this work underscore that there are fundamental differences in enzyme activation between complete darkness and even a very low light level of only 3 - 5 mumol quanta m(-2) s(-1) which predispose leaves to different gas exchange patterns once leaves are transferred to higher light levels.									9	1	0	0	9	0	10			1435-8603			WOS:000226888600007	15666215

In this work, low-loading (<20 wt%) Ni-confined in layered metal oxide anode catalysts (birnessite and lepidocrocite titanate) have been synthesized by facile ion exchange methodology and subjected to systematic electrochemical studies. It was found that Ni-intercalated on K-rich birnessite (Ni-KMO) presents an onset overpotential (eta(onset)) as low as 100 mV and overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2)(eta(10)) of 206 mV in pH = 14 electrolyte. By combining electrochemical methods and X-ray absorption and emission spectroscopies (XAS and XES), we demonstrate Ni sites are the active sites for OER catalysis and that the Mn(3+)sites facilitate Ni intercalation during the ion-exchange process, but display no observable contribution towards OER activity. The effect of the pH and the nature of the supporting electrolyte on the electrochemical performance was also evaluated.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000546391600042

In this study, oxygen-vacancies-functionalized Ni(OH)(2) (OVs-Ni(OH)(2)) nanosheets are synthesized by a photochemical method to serve as a catalyst for CO2 reduction. Characterization reveals that COOH* is the key intermediate for CO2-to-CO photoreduction. Experimental results and theoretical calculations confirm that OVs modification can greatly modulate the interaction strength between the OVs-Ni(OH)(2) and CO2, while lowering the energy barrier for COOH* formation, thereby preferentially facilitating CO2 reduction. As a result, the OVs-Ni(OH)(2) catalyst exhibits outstanding activity and selectivity for CO2-to-CO photoreduction with visible light. A CO evolution rate of 31.58 mu mol h(-1) (0.35 mg catalyst, 90228 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) with a selectivity of 98 % over OVs-Ni(OH)(2) was achieved, outperforming most analogous reported catalysts. Moreover, even under a low CO2 concentration of 0.04 % (representative of the CO2 concentration in air) and low reaction temperature (273 K, 0 degrees C), this catalyst can still trigger CO2 reduction. This work provides a new method to synthesize OVs-Ni(OH)(2) catalysts for efficient CO2 reduction and establishes a relationship between the OVs and the catalytic activity, which may guide the design of highly selective CO2 reduction catalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000795003200001	35445549

Herein, to further enhance the photoelectrochemical properties of ZnO-based photoanodes, we constructed composite ZnO nanoarray photoanodes with Fe-self-doped lanthanum ferrite (denoted as La1-xFe1+xO3/ZnO NRs), which had the effect of killing two birds with one stone. This improvement strategy differs from the previously popular multi-step modification process, and integrates the dual benefits of a heterojunction and cocatalyst using the same material, the doped LaFeO3, which bypasses the shortcomings of multi-step charge transfer. Gratifyingly, benefitting from the suitable energy bands and excellent electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activity of La0.9Fe1.1O3, the photoanode exhibits outstanding bulk charge separation and surface charge utilization efficiencies, as well as achieving a photocurrent density that is over three times higher than that of pristine ZnO NRs, with a small onset potential (0.33 V vs. RHE). This electrode modification concept provides guidance for the development of other highly active photoelectrodes.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000663883300001	34151924

The aluminum complexes 1 and 2 contained seven -membered C402A1 rings with the Al atom bonded to the oxygen atom and coordinated to the nitrogen atom. The reaction of tBu3Ga with the N-tert-butyl amide of succinic acid resulted in the formation of a mixture of 3 and 4. The gallium complex 3 was isostructural to 2, whereas the gallium atoms in the dinuclear compound 4 were bonded to the carboxylate oxygens only forming a central Ga2C2O4 ring. X-ray studies showed that the crystalline solid obtained after crystallization from the post-reaction mixture was composed of crystals of compound 3 and co-crystals of 3 and 4. In all reactions, only the OH protons of the ligand reacted with tBuM groups with an alkane evolution, while NH protons remained unreactive. The reaction of (Bu3Ga)-Bu-t with the N-tert-butyl amide of succinic acid in a 2:1 M ratio of the reagents in the presence of water proceeded with the formation of the unprecedented compound [(GatBu(2))(2)(OH){N(H)(Bu-t)C(O)CH(2)CH(2)COO11 (5) as the only product. Compound 5 was also obtained in the hydrolysis reaction of the mixture of compounds 3 and 4 isolated from the post -reaction mixture of tBu3Ga with the N-tert-butyl amide of succinic acid. The molecular and molecular packing in the crystal structures of 1-3 and 5 were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Crystal structure examinations showed laminar structures of 1, 3, and 5 and a packed crystal network of 2. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we report an effective strategy to tune the surface oxygen species linking site of polymeric CN, achieving more effective charge separation. A high photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of approximately 10225 mu mol h(-1).g(-1)under visible light irradiation (lambda>420 nm) and an impressive apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 5.7 % at 430 nm were recorded. Specifically, thermal treatment under a H(2)and then an air atmosphere allowed the oxygen species linker on the surface of CN to be changed from -C=O to N=C-OH and then -C-O-C-, resulting in unbalanced charge distribution, which significantly enhanced the photogenerated charge separation, further contributing to the high hydrogen production performance. This linker regulation strategy may provide a new path for the development of highly efficient photocatalysts.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000542661800001	32458562

Thus, Mn2O3, LaMnO3, and MgMn2O4 are found to be very good catalysts with turnover frequencies of 5 x 10(-4) s(-1), 4.8 x 10(-4) s(-1), and 0.8 x 10(-4) s(-1), respectively. Among the cobalt oxides, Li2Co2O4 and LaCoO3-especially the latter-exhibit excellent catalytic activity, with the turnover frequencies being 9 x 10(-4) s(-1) and 1.4 x 10(-3) s(-1), respectively. The common feature among the catalytic Mn and Co oxides is not only that Mn and Co are in the trivalent state, but Co3+ in the Co oxides is in the intermediate t(2g) (5)e(g)(1) state whereas Mn3+ is in the t(2g) (3)e(g)(1) state. The presence of the e(g)(1) electron in these Mn and Co oxides is considered to play a crucial role in the photocatalytic properties of the oxides.									136	4	0	0	22	0	139			0027-8424			WOS:000322086100024	23818589

However, the development of facile and high-yield techniques for the fabrication of SACs remains challenging. In this paper, we report a laser-induced solid-phase strategy for the synthesis of Pt SACs on graphene support. Simply by rapid laser scanning/irradiation of a freeze-dried electrochemical graphene oxide (EGO) film loaded with chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6), we enabled simultaneous pyrolysis of H2PtCl6 into SACs and reduction/graphitization of EGO into graphene. The rapid freezing of EGO hydrogel film infused with H2PtCl6 solution in liquid nitrogen and the subsequent ice sublimation by freeze-drying were essential to achieve the atomically dispersed Pt. Nanosecond pulsed infrared (IR; 1064 nm) and picosecond pulsed ultraviolet (UV; 355 nm) lasers were used to investigate the effects of laser wavelength and pulse duration on the SACs formation mechanism. The atomically dispersed Pt on graphene support exhibited a small overpotential of -42.3 mV at -10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction and a mass activity tenfold higher than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. This method is simple, fast and potentially versatile, and scalable for the mass production of SACs.									12	1	0	0	0	0	11			2047-7538			WOS:000686643100002	34408125

While most electrodeposited MnOx WO catalysts are obtained starting from Mn(II) precursors, the proposed protocol consists in the galvanostatic cathodic deposition of Fe-MnOx onto conductive FTO glasses, using KMnO4 and Fe(NO3)(3) as Mn and Fe precursors, respectively. In the absence of Fe, the Tafel slope drastically increases from 103 to 270mV dec(-1) when passing from low to high overpotentials. The slope change, instead, is progressively reduced when the Fe precursor is added to the deposition solution and a constant slope of 105mV dec(-1) is obtained in the whole overpotential range with an optimal Fe concentration of 1.00mM, Accordingly, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) shows that Fe addition improves both charge transfer and transport properties of the electrodeposited films. In particular, a five-fold decrease in charge transfer resistance at the catalyst/electrolyte interface was observed, suggesting a more facile oxygen evolving kinetics for Fe containing samples. Furthermore, the lower the iron content, the lower the film stability, as pointed out by chronopotentiometric measurements, and confimed by FESEM analysis and EIS as measured both before and after water electrolysis experiments. To establish structure activity relationships, an extended characterization of the electrodeposited films was carried out by means of Raman Microscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy, UVevis and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopies. The ensemble of the characterization results suggests that Fe3+ ions are actually incorporated within the electrodeposited film, with limited effects on the final Fe-MnOx structure, consisting in a defective MnO2 birnessite-type structure with significant fraction of surface Mn3+ species.

Optimal electrolytes contained iodide as well as lactic acid. Electrochemical experiments, such as cyclic voltammetry or measurements of open circuit potentials, were performed in different cell set-ups to distinguish between different possible reactions. At the applied potentials of E < -1.4 V, the hydrogen evolution reaction dominated at the implant surface, effectively lifting off the bacterial films. In addition, several disinfecting species are formed at the anode, such as triiodide and hydrogen peroxide. Ex situ tests with model biofilms of E. coli clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of the respective anolytes in killing the bacteria, as determined by the LIVE/DEAD (TM) assay.Using optimized electrolysis parameters of 30 s at 7.0 V and 300 mA, a 14-day old wildtype biofilm could be completely removed from dental implants in vitro.

Here, we design an ultrathin conductor system, in which the special partially occupied band serves as the mediator to simultaneously guarantee IR light harvesting and satisfy band edge positions, while the ultrathin configuration improves charge separation rates and surface redox kinetics. Taking the low cost and earth-abundant CuS as an example, we first fabricate ultrathin CuS layers, where temperature-dependent resistivities, valence-band spectra, and theoretical calculations affirm their metallic nature. Synchrotron-radiation photoelectron and ultraviolet visible--near-infrared spectra show that metallic CuS atomic layers could realize a new cooperative intraband interband transition under IR light irradiation, where the generated electrons and holes could simultaneously involve the carbon dioxide reduction and water oxidation reactions. As a result, CuS atomic layers exhibit nearly 100% selective CO production with an evolution rate of 14.5 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) under IR light irradiation, while the catalytic performance shows no obvious decay after a 96 h test. Briefly, benefiting from ultrahigh conductivity and a unique partially occupied band, abundant conductor materials such as conducting metal sulfides and metal nitrides hold great promise for applications as effective IR light responsive photocatalysts.									87	6	0	0	9	0	86			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000455561800059	30537829

MoO3-x quantum dots (QDs) with both different sizes and oxygen vacancy concentrations could be acquired through this facile and efficient method. The consumption of photoexcited holes played an important role in the morphology changes. In water/ethanol, intercalation of H+ originating from the oxidation of water by photoholes contributes to the acquisition of QDs. While in NMP, we provided a new insight and proved that photocorrosion induced by accumulated holes was responsible for the morphology evolution and acquisition of QDs.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000390787600011

With additional edge defects arising from the etched MoO3 compared to those in the intact MoN nanosheets, dr-MoN was capable of efficiently electro-catalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under both acidic and alkaline conditions with impressive activity and durability. The dr-MoN-0 catalyst possessed an ultrasmall onset overpotential of approximately 10 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte, which is competitive with that of the Pt/C catalyst. Overpotentials of only 125 mV and 139 mV are required to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm (2) for the dr-MoN-0 catalyst in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH, respectively. More importantly, the dr-MoN-0 maintained a prominent amperometric (I-t) durability during a 20 h test and also a superior cycling stability with negligible overpotential loss, all of which are among the best results for current MoN based HER catalysts. The exceptional performance was attributed to the defect-abundant structure which resulted in the formation of tiny cracks on the surface of the nanosheets and caused the additional exposure of active edge sites. These findings highlight the prospective potential of dr-MoN with additional active edge sites as highly efficient and stable platinum-free electrocatalysts towards the HER.									115	8	0	0	4	0	116			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000416340300019		
J	Zhou, Ting; Huang, Xingye; Mi, Zhen; Zhu, Yunyang; Wang, Rong; Wang, Changchun; Guo, Jia								Multivariate covalent organic frameworks boosting photocatalytic hydrogen evolution								POLYMER CHEMISTRY				12	22			3250	3256		10.1039/d1py00247c		MAY 2021		JUN 14 2021	2021	Multivariate covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a desirable platform for synergizing consecutive and multistep photocatalytic energy conversion via inherent functional modules. However, with a variation in the multicomponents in COFs, the ordering of a layered structure is impaired or even disappears, leading to notably weakened photocatalytic performance, as well as the incomplete understanding of the structure-to-performance relationships of multivariate COFs. Herein, we adopt an organobase-modulated multicomponent aldimine reaction to synthesize a series of beta-ketoenamine-linked multivariate COFs consisting of 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol (Tp) as a fixed node and dual-component containing tertiary phenyl (TP) and benzothiadiazole-derived (BT) units as a tailored strut. The various Tp(BTxTP1-x)-COFs maintain high crystallinity and porosity and enable the sophisticated regulation of optical bandgaps and energy band positions by simply varying the feed amounts of the two amine species. More interestingly, the multivariate COFs facilitate exciton dissociation and free charge generation by virtue of the strong electron-deficient BT moiety as an acceptor. In visible photocatalytic water splitting measurements, the maximum hydrogen evolution rate is achieved by a multivariate COF containing 5 mol% of the BT component, reaching as high as 9839 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), which is much higher than those of the parent COFs. With an increase in the BT moiety in the multicomponent skeletons, continuously declining performances are observed. It is likely that BT-induced excimer formation within the coaxial stacking layers may suppress the long-distance exciton diffusion towards the catalytic sites for the charge-carrier-triggered redox reaction. Our work opens up a promising route to modulate the photophysical properties of COFs via a facile bottom-up multicomponent design and sheds light on the structure-to-activity relationships of multivariate COFs in terms of their visible photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.									8	1	0	0	1	0	8			1759-9954	1759-9962		WOS:000651153100001

In the first stage, Ag-PVA is fabricated by mild thermal treatment of a spin-coated thin film, with the polymer functioning as the reducing agent for the embedded metal precursor ions as well as the stabilizer for the generated nanoparticles. In the second stage, an aqueous solution of potassium palladium chloride (K2PdCl4) is spread on this film under ambient conditions, whereupon Pd gets deposited on the Ag nanoparticles through a Galvanic displacement reaction and alloys with it. A crucial requirement of relatively large Ag nanoparticles that can act as the sacrificial template in the second stage is met by the addition of catalytic amounts of cupric ions in the first stage. A gradual variation of the concentration of K(2)PdCl4 solution used in the in situ process allowed a systematic demonstration of the evolution of the bimetallic nanoparticles with the eventual formation of hollow particles with Ag-Pd alloy walls. The high catalytic efficiency of the Ag-Pd hollow nanoparticle-embedded PVA thin film is demonstrated by its application in the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction.									27	0	0	0	3	0	27			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000325991700031

Detailed evolution of the electronic structures and chemical bonding of GO was presented. The enhanced intensity of pi* resonance and the appearance of splitting sigma* resonance in C K-edge XAS spectra suggest high extents of recoveries of pi-conjugation upon reduction using thermal annealing or hydrazine. Experimental results revealed that the carboxyl as well as epoxide and hydroxyl groups on the surface of GO were thermally reduced first, followed by the more difficult removal of carbonyl and cyclic ether groups at higher temperatures. The hydrazine reduction could remove epoxide, hydroxyl and carboxyl groups effectively, whereas the carbonyl groups were partially reduced with the incorporation of nitrogen species simultaneously. The residual oxygen functional groups on hydrazine-reduced GO could be further removed after modest thermal annealing. It was proposed that a combination of both types of reductions would give the best deoxygenation efficiency for the production of graphene. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It is based in topical or systemic delivery of photosensitizing drugs followed by irradiation with visible light. The subsequent photochemical reactions generate reactive oxygen species which are considered the principal cytotoxic agents to induce cell necrosis.In this work we present a PDT model that tries to predict the photodynamic effect on the skin with a topically administered photosensitizer. The time dependent inhomogeneous distribution of the photoactive compound protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) is calculated after obtaining its precursor distribution (Methyl aminolevulinate, MAL) which depends on the drug permeability, diffusion properties of the skin, incubation time and conversion efficiency of MAL to PpIX. Once the optical energy is obtained by means of the Beer Lambert law, a photochemical model is employed to estimate the concentration of the different molecular compounds taking into account the electronic transitions between molecular levels and particles concentrations. The results obtained allow us to know the evolution of the cytotoxic agent in order to estimate the necrotic area adjusting parameters such as the optical power, the photosensitizer concentration, the incubation and exposition time or the diffusivity and permeability of the tissue.

In this work, the Co3O4/Zn-Co-Mo/NF composite is prepared by a hydrothermal method and thermal annealing. The Zn-Co-Mo nanosheet arrays are synthesized on nickel foam (NF) to form a three-dimensional (3D) network to take advantage of the electrical conductivity and viscosity of NF. Co3O4 is produced directly in the 3D microchannels to achieve a large energy density and robust stability. In the test of the supercapacitor performance, the specific capacitance of Co3O4/Zn-Co-Mo/NF is 2169 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1). In addition, excellent long-term cycling stability is observed as manifested by specific capacitance retention of 85% after 4,000 cycles at a current density of 25 A g(-1). As a catalyst in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), Co3O4/Zn-Co-Mo/NF shows an overpotential of 128 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Our results confirm the dual functionality of the materials which have promising potential in energy storage and generation applications. (c) 2022 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS").

J	Sproviero, Eduardo M.								A DFT/B3LYP study of the mechanisms of the O-2 formation reaction catalyzed by the [(terpy) (H2O)Mn-III (O)(2)Mn-IV(OH2) (terpy)] (NO3)(3) complex: A paradigm for photosystem II								JOURNAL OF INORGANIC BIOCHEMISTRY				171				52	66		10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2017.02.014				JUN 2017	2017	We present a theoretical study of the reaction pathway for dioxygen molecular formation catalyzed by the [(terpy)(H2O)Mn-III(O)(2)Mn-IV(OH2) (terpy)](NO3)(3) (terpy = 2,2 ':6 ',2 ''-terpyridine) complex based on DFT-B3LYP calculations. In the initial state of the reaction, a partial oxido radical (0.44 spins) is formed ligated to Mn. This radical is involved in a nucleophylic attack by bulk water in the O-O bond reaction formation step, in which the oxido fractional unpaired electron is delocalized toward the outermost Mn of the mu-oxo bridge, instead of the ligated Mn center. The reaction then follows with a series of proton-coupled electron transfer steps, in which the oxidation state, as well as the bond strength of the OO moiety increase, while the OO-Mn(1) bond gets weaker until O-2 is released. In this model, basic acetate ions from the buffer solution capture protons in the proton-transfer steps. In each step there is reduction of the OO-Mn(1) binding strength, with concomitant increase of the O-O bond strength, which culminates with the release of O-2 in the last step. This last step is entropy driven, while formation of hydroperoxide and superoxide moieties is enthalpy driven. According with experiments, the rate-limiting step is the double oxidation of Mn(IV,III) or peroxymonosulfate binding, which occur prior to the O-O bond formation step. This supports our findings that the barriers of all intermediate steps are below the experimental barrier of 19-21 kcal/mol. The implications of these findings for understanding photosynthetic water-splitting catalysis are also discussed. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The utilization of solar illumination to produce H-2 from water electrolysis is an alternative route to address the issue. However, the reaction is a thermodynamically uphill task. Furthermore, designing a photocathode, which can use most of the incident radiation for the photoelectrochemical (PEC) reaction, plays an important role. Surface-modified p-Si can be an economically viable option. The sluggish electro-kinetics on the Si surface has been rectified with coatings of cocatalyst materials. In the current review, we have discussed the possible modifications performed on the p-Si surface to reduce the loss due to reflection and coating of the cocatalyst, e.g. MoS2 on p-Si to improve H-2 evolution. The facile charge carrier kinetics at the electrode-electrolyte interface has also been discussed. The development of cocatalysts has been focused on our previous experience for two decades. From surface plasmon resonance to heteroatom doping, that is, intentional defect formation and heterostructure design, we have included a comprehensive discussion on cocatalysts. The energetics of single atom replacement and its implications for efficiency has been included. This review gives insights into the currently emerging cocatalyst design for PEC water splitting. In this regard, the review presents insights into the phase transformation in MoS2 during the PEC process using operando techniques. A discussion on the effect of single atom replacement in the inactive basal-MoS2 plane has been included.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000621407000003

The effects of applied current density (5, 10, or 20 mAcm(-2)) and oxidation time (0 to 5 h) were evaluated following changes in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC). Current efficiency and specific energy consumption were also evaluated. Besides, the organic byproducts generated by EOP were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results show that current densities and oxidation time lead to a COD and TOC reduction. For the 20 mAcm(-2), changes in the kinetic regime were found at 3 h and associated to the oxidation of inorganic ions by chlorinated species. After 3 h, the oxidants act in the organic oxidation, leading to a TOC removal of 71%. Although, due to the evolution of parallel reactions (O-2, H2O2, and O-3), the specific energy consumption also increased, the resulting consumption value of 66.5 kWhkg(-1) of COD is considered a low energy requirement representing lower treatment costs. These results encourage the applicability of EOP equipped with Nb/BDD as a treatment process for the ROC.									9	1	0	0	2	0	9			1661-7827	1660-4601		WOS:000462664200141	30845691

Platinum-carbon films with Pt content up to 95-97 wt % were deposited using different sputtering regimes-DC (direct current) sputtering with and without application of a pulse negative bias voltage to the titanium substrate and also bipolar pulse sputtering with frequency of 10 kHz and 100 kHz. Composite platinum carbon targets were used for sputtering. Characteristics of platinum-carbon films were compared with those of platinum films deposited using the same regimes. The main methods of investigation were scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy; potentiostatic and potentiodynamic methods. The catalytic activity of platinum-carbon films increased with platinum content and at a platinum concentration of 95-97 wt % became higher than that of platinum films sputtered in the same regimes. It was proposed that carbon atoms deposited on the substrate limited the mobility of the deposited platinum species and inhibited Pt cluster growth. Platinum-carbon films produced by pulsed DC magnetron sputtering with pulsed frequency 100 kHz consisted of narrow Pt columns with dome nanotops forming a well-developed surface. The porosity and specific surface of these columnar nanopillar films were higher compared with those of pure platinum films deposited under the same conditions. Moreover, the platinum-carbon films deposited using a bipolar pulse regime with a frequency of 100 kHz had the highest specific surface, porosity (30%) and catalytic activity in hydrogen and oxygen evolution due to a high ion current density and reduced pulse duration which inhibited the growth of large platinum globules.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2073-4344			WOS:000454711500097

Here we report novel kinds of Mn,N co-doped porous Mo2C nanorods for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic solution, which are facilely fabricated based on Mn-modified MoOx-amine precursors. The obtained porous, monocrystalline nanorods without carbon impurities could not only provide abundant catalytic sites, but also facilitate electrolyte penetration and hydrogen release. Furthermore, the fine-tuned electronic structure of Mo2C nanorods with Mn,N dopants could produce more available active sites and reduce the hydrogen adsorption energy (Delta G(H*)). As a result, the optimized Mn,N co-doped Mo2C nanorods exhibit high HER activity with a low overpotential (eta(10) = 163 mV), a small Tafel slope (66 mV dec(-1)), and excellent long-term stability in acidic electrolyte. EPR and DFT calculations confirm that the high performance originates from new active sites (Mn site), a low charge-transfer resistance and an optimized adsorption-desorption behavior after Mn,N co-doping. This work may provide a new pathway to design and explore efficient non-noble metal water-splitting electrocatalysts via electronic engineering of their compositions and nanostructures.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2052-1553			WOS:000491293500027

Carbon-supported Pt single atoms or sub-nanometer-sized Pt clusters (Pt-c/C) are promising catalysts for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, critical challenges remain in the mass production of high-quality Pt-c/C catalysts. Herein, we report a facile synthesis method to achieve highly dispersed and highly dense Pt(c)s (average diameter of similar to 0.4 nm) on various carbon supports (CSs). A tannic acid (TA) monolayer (TA(i))-functionalized CS surface was achieved through pi-pi interactions without destroying the conjugated structure of CSs. TA(i) aids the adsorption of the Pt-c precursor monolayer on CSs in a facile impregnation process. Notably, the thermally treated TA fragment-stabilized Pt(c)s strongly anchored to the carbon surface to form a highly thermostable Pt-c/C catalyst, reported here for the first time. The synthesized Pt-c/C catalyst (Pt-c(250)/C) exhibits an exceptionally high Pt mass activity (i(mPt))/turnover frequency (TOF) at eta = 60 mV (154.5 A mg(-1)/156.1 s(-1)), which are similar to 106 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C (1.46 A mg(-1)/1.48 s(-1)) and superior to those of the state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000697471700001

However, manipulating the electronic structure and relevant physical properties of the catalysts is crucial in promoting their hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance but still a formidable challenge. In this work, we report a self-supported dual-metal doped on CoP3 nanowire arrays (NAs) and grown on carbon fiber cloth (Ni,Mn-CoP3 NAs) for alkaline HER. The optimized catalyst exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity, giving a low overpotential of 24 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 41 mV dec(-1) and can sustain for 24 h, which is superior to the commercial Pt/C catalysts at a large current density. On the basis of systematic experiments and density functional theory calculations, the synergistic regulation of dual-metal doping can re-form the electronic structure so as to enhance the electrical conductivity, improve the intrinsic HER activity, and increase the electrochemical surface area of CoP3. This work points out avenues in the reasonable design and development of dual-metal doped transition-metal phosphides as highly active, durable, and economically viable catalysts for various catalytic reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0003-6951	1077-3118		WOS:000822930100001

Herein, we report a facile, scalable and green synthetic methodology to fabricate porous carbon encapsulated transition metal nanocatalysts (M@TP: M = Cu, Ni, Fe and Co) using commercial tissue paper. The morphology, crystalline structure, chemical composition and textural properties of the M@TP nanocatalysts were thoroughly characterized. The catalytic activity of the M@TP nanocatalysts was investigated for the degradation of Congo red (CR) via peroxymonosulfate activation. Co@TP-6 was found to be the most active catalyst allowing 97.68% degradation in 30 min with a higher rate constant of 0.109 min(-1). The nanocatalysts also displayed a carbon shell thickness-dependent electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity, most likely due to the shielding effect of the carbon layers over the electron transfer (ET) processes at the metal core/carbon interfaces. Remarkably, the Ni@TP-6 electrocatalyst, with the smaller carbon shell thickness, showed the best electrocatalytic performance. They delivered an ultralow onset potential of -30 mV vs RHE, an overpotential of 105 mV at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) and an excellent electrochemical stability to keep the 92% of the initial current applied after 25000 s, which is comparable with the HER activity of the state-of-the-art Ni-based catalysts.

Some ingenious biological structures have highly efficient solar light absorption, matter transmission, and natural photocatalytic properties, such as leaves, sunflowers, seaweeds, algae, bacteria. Artificial photocatalysis, which involves CO2 reduction and water splitting to obtain green renewable energy or oxygen, is of great significance for solving the problem of energy shortages, achieving carbon neutrality, and building a sustainable society. In order to improve the efficiency of artificial photocatalysis, it is necessary to develop highly efficient photocatalysts by expanding ideas and drawing innovative inspiration from nature. Artificially constructed photocatalysts with bionic structures achieved by simulating natural organisms have gradually become an exciting research field with great potential in recent years. This article reviews bioinspired photocatalysts and photocatalytic systems from the aspects of principle, composition, construction method, and the achieved performance. It is expected that this review will help researchers develop a systematic and in-depth understanding for the biomimetic design of photocatalysts and photocatalytic systems.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2366-7486			WOS:000763594400001

The non-PGM substituents are often more financially beneficial but low in activity and durability in the acidic environment. In this study, cobalt phosphide catalysts, which are promising non-PGM alternatives for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and have enhanced durability and single-cell performance, were fabricated directly on carbon paper using the pulse electrodeposition method. As the dissolution potential (reported as -x vs saturated calomel electrode) of the pulse electrodeposition shifted in the positive direction, the P/Co ratio of the Co-P-x catalysts increased because of severe Co dissolution. Among the catalysts, Co-P-0.6, Co-P-0.5, and Co-P-0.4 (where the number indicates the negative dissolution potential) were rapidly degraded in acid, whereas Co-P-0.3, Co-P-0.2, and Co-P-0.1 showed high stability because of the relative amounts of CoP and Co2P phases. The acid-dissolved Co-P-0.3 catalyst showed the best half-cell performance (an overpotential of 143.85 mV at 10 mA/cm(2)) and durability, and the P-Co and Co delta+ surface states are critical for its performance. Single-cell tests using the Co-P-0.3 cathode revealed its remarkable performance of 1.89 A/cm(2) at 2.0 V-cell, indicating its promise as a non-PGM cathode material for PEMWEs.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000658906400001

Two different light configurations were used to isolate the effect of the irradiation wavelength (UV and visible light) on the textural and chemical features of the carbon photoanode, and its long-term photocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction. A complete characterization of the carbon showed that the photocorrosion of carbon anodes of low functionalization follows a different pathway than highly functionalized carbons. The carbon matrix gets slightly oxidized, with the formation of carboxylic and carbonyl-like moieties in the surface of the carbon anode after light exposure. The oxidation of the carbon occurred due to the photogeneration of oxygen reactive species upon the decomposition of water during the irradiation of the photoanodes. Furthermore, the photoinduced surface reactions depend on the nature of the carbon anode and its ability to photogenerate reactive species in solution, rather than on the wavelength of the irradiation source. This surface modification is responsible for the decreased efficiency of the carbon photoanode throughout long illumination periods, due to the effect of the oxidation of the carbon matrix on the charge transfer. In this work, we have corroborated that, in the case of a low functionalization carbon material, the photocorrosion also occurs although it proceeds through a different pathway. The carbon anode gets gradually slightly oxidized due to the photogeneration of O-reactive species, being the incorporation of the O-groups responsible for the decreased performance of the anode upon long-term irradiation due to the effect of the oxidation of the carbon matrix on the electron transfer.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1420-3049			WOS:000389918200188

A system presenting a pulsed ECR plasma and a constant high voltage of the target has the advantage of monoenergetic implantation. Depth distributions and chemical interactions were investigated by AES and XPS. Surface microstructure and friction forces on the nanometric scales were evaluated by AFM. We found that the depth of implantation can be controlled by the sample position relative to the extraction grid, which may have benefits for certain applications. The evolution of the implantation indicates that at room temperature, the chemical reactions involved lead to sub-stoichiometricor composite products. in the nitriding case, an increase in microroughness and a reduction of local friction forces on the nanometric scale were found.

Several photosynthetic parameters were measured on the intact leaf level including CO2 assimilation rates, O-2 evolution, photosystem II activities, thylakoid proton circuit and dissipation of excitation energy. Gross rates of O-2 evolution (J(O2), measured by analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence), net rates of O-2 evolution and CO2 assimilation responded in parallel to changes in light and CO2 levels. The C-4 subtypes had similar energy requirements for photosynthesis since there were no significant differences in maximal quantum efficiencies for gross rates of O-2 evolution (average value = 0.072 O-2/quanta absorbed,similar to 14 quanta per O-2 evolved). At saturating actinic light intensities, when photosynthesis was suppressed by decreasing CO2, ATP synthase proton conductivity (g(H)(+)) responded strongly to changes in electron flow, decreasing linearly with J(O2), which was previously observed in C-3 plants. It is proposed that g(H)(+) is controlled at the substrate level by inorganic phosphate availability. The results suggest development of nonphotochemical quenching in C-4 plants is controlled by a decrease in g(H)(+), which causes an increase in proton motive force by restricting proton efflux from the lumen, rather than by cyclic or pseudocyclic electron flow.									13	0	0	0	12	0	13			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000280921200002	20549356

However, the activity is still limited by the inefficient charge extraction. Here a highly conductive cable-like bicomponent titania photoanode, consisting of reduced anatase-coated TiO2-B nanowires, is proposed to simultaneously establish effective electron and hole transport channels separately, which meets the requirements of electronic dynamics for efficient water splitting. A synergistic effect of charge separation from the built-in electric field is demonstrated with this 1D TiO2-B/anatase heterojunction, in which a high electron collection efficiency of up to 97.1% at 0.6 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode is achieved. The efficient electron collection approaching the limitation is also attributed to the large electron conducting region in the photoanode. Moreover, the O-deficient amorphous layer is found to be more catalytic toward the oxygen evolution reaction through quantifying rate constants for charge recombination and charge transfer. It can reduce onset potential and suppress charge-carrier recombination simultaneously, prompting surface hole collection efficiency up to 95% at 0.6 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000443375900024

We summarize our current understanding of Au atom release on the (111) surface and the corresponding effects on adsorption and reactivity. Gold was selected for these investigations because of the recent intense interest in the activity of gold nanoparticles for several important catalytic reactions. Fundamental experimental studies on Au single-crystal surfaces have established that atomic O is extremely active for oxidation of CO and olefins, that the local bonding of O is an important factor in determining the reactivity and selectivity for oxidation, and that Au atom release is induced by electronegative adsorbates, such as O, Cl, and S. These experimental results guided our theoretical studies. Density functional theory is an extremely useful tool since it evaluates the energetics associated with the incorporation of gold into the adsorbate layer, while providing fundamental physical insight into the underlying cause of gold incorporation. We use our results from static DFT calculations along with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to understand the effect of surface morphology on the activity of gold for CO oxidation. Our investigation of Au atom release and incorporation induced by electronegative atoms clearly illustrates the importance of using experiments in combination with theory to establish the importance of and the underlying reasons for metal atom release and the affect on bonding and reactivity.					237th National Meeting of the American-Chemical-Society237th National Meeting of the American-Chemical-Society	MAR 22-26, 2009MAR 22-26, 2009	Amer Chem SocAmer Chem Soc	Salt Lake City, UTSalt Lake City, UT	15	0	0	0	1	0	15			1022-5528	1572-9028		WOS:000276979100008

The electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is one of the most promising strategies to synthesize value-added ammonia (NH3) under mild conditions with low energy utilization and less greenhouse gas emission. However, the lack of effective electrocatalysts remains the major hurdle for its practical applications. Ruthenium is generally considered a promising electrocatalyst for the electrochemical NRR. However, it exhibits a high overpotential corresponding to the potential determining step in the reduction pathway. Herein, using density functional theory, we systematically investigated the potential of a series of transition metal-doped Ru-based TM@Ru(0001) (TM = Sc-Zn, Y-Cd) single-atom alloys to evaluate their NRR activity. Among all the studied catalysts, it was found that the V doped Ru(0001) SAA exhibited a reduced kinetic barrier of about 1.14 eV as compared to that of the pure Ru(0001) corresponding to the potential determining step (PDS). In addition, it showed a significantly low negative limiting potential of -0.15 V for the PDS along with thermodynamical stability and high selectivity over the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The Climbing-Image Nudged Elastic Band (CI-NEB) method was employed to calculate the barrier height between various hydrogenation steps of the reduction reaction followed by the calculation of turnover frequency (TOF) for V@Ru(0001) using a microkinetic modelling approach. The TOF for V@Ru(0001) was found to be 4.24 x 10(-3) per s per site at 100 bar and 700 K, which is far better than that of the pure Ru(0001) surface. This report provides a new design strategy to improve the catalytic performance of Ru(0001) for effective NRR.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000742089900001

Various reactant mixtures (H-2 and O-2) fed simultaneously through a glass frit to the anodic electrode which was immersed in the electrolyte. Both positive and negative currents were applied between anode and cathode while all the reactants were followed by mass spectrometry.RESULTS: In the case of Pt electrode, it was found that application of small positive currents resulted in a reversible enhancement of both oxygen and hydrogen consumption rate, higher than the expected Faradaic one (I/2F). Pd and Rh electrodes exhibited lower catalytic activity at ambient temperature while positive current applications induced an acceleration of the catalytic reaction. Interestingly, modification of the catalytic activity of Pd and Rh electrodes was found to be irreversible even under negative current applications.CONCLUSION: Commercially available, carbon supported metal (Pt, Rh, Pd) catalysts, can be electrochemically promoted during hydrogen oxidation reaction in alkaline media. The rate enhancement could be explained by modification of the work function of the catalytic surface (thus the strength of the reactant's adsorption bond) during potential or current application as well as modification of the catalyst surface composition.

The thermodynamic model based on ion and molecule coexistence theory and conservation law of element atoms was established to analyze the change in aluminum and titanium along the height of ingot. The results show that low CaO slag is suitable for electroslag remelting of metal containing high titanium-to-aluminum ratio. As electroslag remelting process consists of slag temperature-rising and temperature-stable periods, TiO2 should be added into water-cooled copper mold during temperature-rising period in order to keep the thermodynamic equilibrium between titanium and aluminum, and the amount of TiO2 is the difference value calculated by the reaction between titanium and alumina at 1477 and 1677 degrees C.									15	4	0	0	0	0	15			1006-706X	2210-3988		WOS:000459200900003

Many synthetic techniques have been utilized in preparation of binary alloy NPs loaded TiO2. However, control of deposition site for alloy NPs on TiO2 is one of the challenging themes in TiO2 study. Herein, we present that site-selective Pt-Pb NPs deposition on rutile TiO2 nanorod by successive reduction in metal ions, photo-reduction of Pt4+ and followed by microwave assisted polyol reduction of Pb2+ (2-step method). The Pt-Pb NPs were site-selectively deposited on the reduction site on (110) surface of the rutile TiO2 nanorod. The photocatalytic activity of rutile TiO2 was significantly enhanced after Pt-Pb NPs loading for oxidative decomposition of AcOH in aqueous phase. The AcOH was completely oxide to CO2 and the CO2 evolution of the site-selectively Pt-Pb NPs deposited TiO2 was nearly six times higher than that of a bare rutile TiO2 and three times higher than randomly Pt-Pb NPs deposited TiO2. The well mating of the reduction reaction site on photocatalyst, TiO2, and deposition site for co-catalyst, Pt-Pb NPs, induces efficient electron injection from photocatalyst TiO2 to co-catalyst Pt-Pb NPs, promoting oxygen reduction reaction and reduction process of AcOH oxidative decomposition. The accelerated electron consumption in reduction process leads to smooth oxidative decomposition of AcOH at oxidation site. These findings suggest that the site-selective deposition of alloy NPs is a predominant way to bring out catalytic performance of co-catalyst alloy NPs on TiO2. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Motivated by this point, increasing attention has been given to the development of photocatalysts comprising intimately interfaced photoabsorbers and cocatalysts. Herein, a simple one-step approach is reported to fabricate a high-efficiency photocatalytic system, in which single-site dispersed iron atoms are rationally integrated on the intrinsic structure of the porous crimped graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) polymer. A detailed analysis of the formation process shows that a stable complex is generated by spontaneously coordinating dicyandiamidine nitrate with iron ions in isopropanol, thus leading to a relatively complicated polycondensation reaction upon thermal treatment. The correlation of experimental and computational results confirms that optimized electronic structures of Fe@g-C3N4 with an appropriate d-band position and negatively shifting Fermi level can be achieved, which effectively gains the reducibility of electrons and creates more active sites for the photocatalytic reactions. As a result, the Fe@g-C3N4 exhibits a highlighted intramolecular synergistic effect, performing greatly enhanced solar-photon-driven activities, including excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate (3390 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), lambda > 420 nm) and a reliable apparent quantum efficiency value of 6.89% at 420 nm.									52	2	0	0	2	0	52			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000496318800001	31725197	
J	Griffiths, JF; MacNamara, JP; Mohamed, C; Whitaker, BJ; Pan, JF; Sheppard, CGW								Temperature fields during the development of autoignition in a rapid compression machine								FARADAY DISCUSSIONS				119				287	303		10.1039/b102002l				2001	2001	Temperature and concentration fields have been investigated in the cylindrical combustion chamber of a rapid compression machine (RCM) by schlieren photography, chemiluminescent imaging and planar laser induced fluorescence of acetone and of formaldehyde in a 2-dimensional sheet across the diameter. The timescale of particular interest was up to 10 ms after the piston has stopped. Experiments were performed in non-reactive and reactive conditions. Acetone was seeded in non-reactive mixtures. Combustion was studied first in a system containing di-tert-butyl peroxide vapour in the presence of oxygen. The decomposition of di-tert-butyl peroxide generates methyl radicals, which are then oxidised if oxygen is present. The overall reaction is exothermic and is characteristic of a conventional thermal ignition. In addition, chemiluminescence, resulting from CH2O*, accompanies the oxidation process. The combustion of n-pentane was then investigated at compressed gas temperatures that spanned the range in which there is a negative temperature dependence of the overall reaction rate, typically 750-850 K. The response to thermal feedback in this more complex thermokinetic system can be the opposite of the "thermal runaway" that accompanies di-tert-butyl peroxide combustion. The purpose of making comparisons between these two types of systems was to show how the temperature field generated in the RCM is modified in different ways by the interaction with the chemistry and to discuss the implications of this for the spatial development of spontaneous ignition. As the piston of the RCM moves it shears gas off the walls of the chamber. This probably creates a roll-up vortex, but more importantly it also collects gas from the walls and moves it across the cylinder head pushing it forward into a plug at the centre. Thus, soon after the end of compression there is an adiabatically heated gas which extends virtually to the wall, but this incorporates a plug of colder gas at its core. Diffusive transport will occur, but the timescale is relatively slow, and the effect hardly shows until at least 10 ms post-compression. The consequence of "thermal runaway" on a timescale that is compatible with the development of this temperature field is that the reaction rate in the adiabatically compressed toroidal region accelerates faster than in the core, and goes to completion first. A somewhat similar pattern emerges during n-pentane combustion when the initial condition is set at the lower end of the negative temperature dependent range. By contrast, at adiabatically compressed gas temperatures close to the upper end of the negative temperature dependent region, the reaction rate in the cooler core develops faster than that in the surrounding zone, and the temperature difference is rapidly smoothed out. This does not lead to spatial homogeneity in all respects, however, because different rates and extents of reaction generate different concentrations of intermediates. This stratification has implications for the eventual spatial evolution of spontaneous ignition.

Hydrothermally synthesized Mn3O4 is incorporated into graphene mixed with melamine as a nitrogen source and annealed at a temperature between 700 degrees C and 1000 degrees C. The phase formation, purity and morphological behaviours of pre-formed Mn3O4 and MnO after annealing are systematically studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The MnO and N-doped graphene (MnO/NG) catalyst enhances ORR activity compared to other combinations of hybrid catalysts, such as Mn3O4/G and MnO/G, as observed from the linear sweep voltammograms. It is found that MnO/NG annealed at 900 degrees C demonstrates excellent ORR catalytic activity in O-2 saturated 0.1 M aqueous KOH electrolyte with a dominant 4e(-) transfer process, as confirmed by both RDE and RRDE measurements. The stability and durability of this optimized catalyst is ascertained by potential cycling between -0.8 and 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl up to 10 000 potential cycles; superior durability was found in comparison to the state-of-art Pt/C catalyst. This MnO/NG-900 hybrid catalyst is used as a cathode catalyst, and we fabricate a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) to validate the catalyst in an anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC). A peak power density of 13 mW cm(-2) at 30 degrees C under ambient pressure is realized; thus, our catalyst appears to be promising as an alternative non-precious metal catalyst for AEMFCs.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15				2046-2069		WOS:000385633100027

Spinel Co3O4 microcrystals with a windmill shape were grown on a flexible metal substrate. The microcrystals were then roughened by a surface impregnation treatment. A secondary nanostructure grew out of the blades of the windmills to form a micro/nano hierarchical structure. The as-grown micro/nano Co3O4 had an excellent electrochemical performance in the oxidation of water. The onset overpotential of the micro/nano Co3O4 electrocatalyst for the oxidation of water was about 0.29 V in alkaline solution and the overpotential of the optimum Co3O4 electrocatalyst was 0.41 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). These results suggest that the electrochemical performance is associated with the roughness and active surface of the Co3O4 electrodes. The turnover frequency of the optimized Co3O4 reached 0.39 s(-1) at an overpotential of 0.6 V, about 1.4 times higher than that for the pristine Co3O4 microcrystals. The turnover frequency of micro/nano Co3O4 is higher than, or comparable to, that previously reported for high-efficiency nanosized Co3O4 in alkaline solution. Stability tests indicated that these micro/nano Co3O4 electrocatalysts were highly durable towards the oxidation of water, with no structural change and no decrease in noticeable activity after operating for 12 h in oxygen-evolving reactions. This work verifies the contribution of surface roughness and an active surface to the electrochemical oxidation of water by the design of an optimum micro/nano Co3O4 electrocatalyst. Our current understanding of the catalytic role of a specific micro/nano structure is also strengthened.									45	1	0	0	0	0	46				2046-2069		WOS:000344526700012		
J	Carroll, Gerard M.; Gamelin, Daniel R.

Prior studies have demonstrated that modification of alpha-Fe2O3 photoanodes with the water-oxidation electrocatalyst Co-Pi enhances photon-to-current conversion efficiencies, particularly at less positive potentials, but the mechanism underlying this enhancement remains poorly understood. Different experimental techniques have suggested very different interpretations of the microscopic origins of this improvement. Here, we report results from photoelectrochemical and impedance measurements aimed at understanding the Co-Pi/alpha-Fe2O3 interface of mesostructured composite photoanodes. Contrary to expectations, these measurements reveal that alpha-Fe2O3 water-oxidation kinetics actually slow upon deposition of Co-Pi, but electron-hole recombination slows even more, resulting in a net enhancement of water-oxidation quantum efficiency. The negative shift in the J-V curve caused by Co-Pi deposition is found to result from the introduction of an alternative pathway for water oxidation catalyzed by Co-Pi, which allows the composite photoanode to avoid positive charge accumulation at the alpha-Fe2O3 surface. We detail the role of Co-Pi thickness optimization in balancing the slower recombination against the slower water oxidation kinetics to achieve the lowest water-oxidation onset potential. These results provide new insights into the microscopic properties of the catalyst/semiconductor interface in Co-Pi/alpha-Fe2O3 composite solar water-splitting photoanodes.									137	6	0	0	9	0	138			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000371077300025

Biomass contains all the substances in nature that in the recent past were living things, made from living organisms or their wastes. Biomass is carbon-based and is a mixture of organic molecules, including hydrogen, usually oxygen, and often nitrogen, and small amounts of other atoms such as alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, and heavy metals. Production and consumption of biomasses grew in sustainable procedures do not cause a net change in the CO2 content of the atmosphere. So, the biomasses can be regarded as carbon neutral due to the mentioned net carbon cycle they involve. Energy production from biomass sources is utilized to generate electricity and heat. These sources are renewable sources and CO2 production of these sources is natural and does not produce greenhouse gases. The development of practical techniques for sustainable energy generation from biomass is one of novel strategy to overcome air pollution and move towards the sustainable bioeconomy. This study reviews recent progress in Biomass-derived nanoelectrocatalysts for the sustainable energy development that includes biomass-based electrocatalyst synthesis, biomass-based nanoelectrocatalysts for water splitting, and biomass-based nanoelectrocatalysts for fuel cells. Finally provides future perspectives to motivate future research such as the necessity to increase agricultural and so food production while reducing inputs to balance biomass valorization for energy production versus biomass upgrading, and to develop practical techniques for cheap pretreatment and metabolic engineering of lignocellulosic and efficient strategies for the commercial-scale production of lignocellulosic based-biofuels.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000802217000001

It has an appropriate band gap energy of ca. 2.76 eV to absorb visible light, corresponding to an absorption edge of 450 nm. When Pt-Cr2O3 was co-loaded, BDV could split water under UV light and visible light. The amounts of the produced hydrogen and oxygen were about 7.27 and 3.82 mu mol respectively under the irradiation of visible light (lambda > 420 nm) for 2 h. This study indicated that the suitable band gap of BDV for overall water splitting might be attributed to the formation of new VB due to Bi6s participating in the electronic structure.									37	3	0	0	1	0	38			1011-372X			WOS:000268294700022		
J	Song, Peng; Li, Yan; Yin, Shuang								Mechanistic insights into homogeneous electrocatalytic reaction for energy storage using finite element simulation								CHINESE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING				42				285	296		10.1016/j.cjche.2021.12.001				FEB 2022	2022	The application of homogeneous electrocatalytic reactions in energy storage and conversion has driven surging interests of researchers in exploring the reaction mechanisms of molecular catalysts. In this paper, homogeneous electrocatalytic reaction between hydroxymethylferrocene (HMF) and L-cysteine is intensively investigated by cyclic voltammetry and square wave voltammetry for which, the second-order rate constant (k(ec)) of the chemical reaction between HMF+ and L-cysteine is determined via a 1D homogeneous electrocatalytic reaction model based on finite element simulation. The corresponding k(ec) (1.1 (mol.m(-3))(-1).s(-1)) is further verified by linear sweep voltammograms under the same model. Square wave voltammetry parameters including potential frequency (f), increment (E-step) and amplitude (E-SW) have been comprehensively investigated in terms of the voltammetric waveform transition of homogeneous electrocatalytic reaction. Specifically, the effect of potential frequency and increment is in accordance with the potential scan rate in cyclic voltammetry and the increase of pulsed potential amplitude results in a conspicuous split oxidative peaks phenomenon. Moreover, the proposed methodology of k(ec) prediction is examined by hydroxyethylferrocene (HEF) and L-cysteine. The present work facilitates the understanding of homogeneous electrocatalytic reaction for energy storage purpose, especially in terms of electrochemical kinetics extraction and flow battery design.

Herein, we developed an efficient method to access edge rich lattice-distorted MoS2 for highly efficient HER via in-situ sulphuration of atomic Co/Mo species that were well-dispersed in a formamide-derived N-doped carbonaceous (f-NC) substrate. Apart from others, pre-embedding Co/Mo species in f-NC controls the release of metal sources upon annealing in S vapor, grafting the as-made MoS2 with merits of short-range crystallinity, distorted lattices, rich defects, and more edges exposed. The content of atomic Co species embedded in MoS2 reaches up to 2.85 at.%, and its atomic dispersion has been systematically confirmed by using XRD, HRTEM, XPS, and XAS characterizations. The Co-doped MoS2 sample exhibits excellent HER activity, achieving overpotentials of 67 and 155 mV at j = 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. Density functional theory simulations suggest that, compared with free-doping MoS2, the edged Co doping is responsible for the significantly improved HER activity. Our method, in addition to providing reliable Pt-matched HER catalysts, may also inspire the general synthesis of edge-rich metal-doped metal chalcogenide for a wide range of energy conversion applications.(c) 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Results show that Co-0.3 (nm)/Pt(111) fabricated at temperatures lower than 393 K displays extra low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) spots outside the integer ones, indicating incoherent epitaxial growth of Co. A new IR band that is attributed to linearly bonded carbon monoxide (CO) on the Pt site influenced by neighboring Co atoms emerges at 2052 cm(-1) for 333 K fabricated Co-0.3 (nm)/Pt(111), in addition to the CO-Pt and CO-Co bands. With increasing fabrication temperature, the new band shifts to higher frequencies and reaches 2082 cm(-1) for 773 K fabricated Co-0.3 (nm)/Pt(111), which has a diffuse (1 x 1) LEED pattern. We evaluated the dependence of the deposition temperature on the lattice parameters of the Co-0.3 (nm)/Pt(111) and ascribed the band at 2082 cm(-1) to adsorbed CO on a Pt-enriched topmost surface having 6-fold symmetry. Although the incoherent epitaxial Co layer was unstable in 0.1 MHClO4 aqueous solution, the Pt-enriched topmost surface is rather stable and the ORR activity is 10 times higher than that for clean Pt(111). The activities for Pt-0.3 nm, (0.6 nm)/Co-0.3 nm/Pt(111) artificial sandwich (superlattice) surfaces were also evaluated. The obtained results indicate that the Co atoms located at the second atomic layer strongly modify the electrocatalysis of the topmost surface.									32	0	0	0	0	0	32			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000295058100024

However, the tedious heteroatoms doping pathways hinders the maximizing of catalytic performances. Herein, we synthesize a series of high-efficient Co and N, P heteroatoms co-doped carbon-based composites by first constructing a novel in-situ P-doped MOF with novel larger N, P-containing ligands and 2-methylimidazole as mixed ligands, and then calcining these MOFs at high temperature. During the pyrolysis process, the generated gases derived from the thermal decomposition of organic ligands are liberated from inner of P-ZIF materials to make the Co-Co2P@NC-P catalysts become loose and porous. When being used as electrode materials, the optimal Co-Co2P@NC-P-3-700 catalyst exhibits excellent ORR and OER activity, the ORR performance is superior to the Pt/C catalysts, and the OER performance can be comparable with the commercial RuO2 catalyst. Moreover, when applied in the assembled primary Zn-air battery, the performances of Co-Co2P@NC-P-3-700 catalyst can outperform the commercial Pt/C catalysts, exhibiting a high peak power density, specific capacity and a long-term stability.

However, it still remains a challenging task. This study reports on the use of a simple approach in the preparation of a flexible 3D self-supporting bifunctional catalyst. Ultrathin NiFe-based layered double hydroxide nanosheets (NiFe-LDH) have in this approach been strongly coupled to a metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived carbon nanoflake array, to be used in flexible Zn-air batteries. Importantly, the introduction of Co nanoparticles that were anchored onto the nitrogen-doped porous carbon (Co-NC) nanoflakes provided an abundance of active sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Moreover, the catalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process was improved by altering the local electronic structure of the Ni and Fe species in NiFe-LDH. The 3D interconnected con-ductive network structure, in addition to the strong coupling between NiFe-LDH and Co-NC, was found to give a catalyst with superior electrocatalytic OER performances. The overpotential was only 284 mV at 50 mA cm-2 in an alkaline medium, which is a result that outperforms the commercial RuO2 catalyst. This bifunctional catalyst did also exhibit a good catalytic performance that is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C towards ORR. Interestingly, when this catalyst was used as binder-free air cathode, the assembled flexible solid-state Zn-air battery demonstrated a favorable power density, cycling stability, and mechanical flexibility. The present work offers a facile and efficient strategy for the development and construction of self-supporting bifunctional OER/ORR electrocatalysts, to be used in wearable and flexible electronic de-vices.

Here, we describe our in-depth investigation of the relationship between the ORR activity and structure of the Pt-ML/Pd/C catalyst during the stability test. By virtue of the rotating disk electrode technique, an accelerated degradation test with the potential window of 0.65 to 1.05 V was applied to the Pt-ML/Pd/C to interrogate its long-term reliability in the ORR, the change of its electrochemical surface area, and its surface composition and components. The Pt-ML/Pd/C catalyst displayed a volcano-like mass/dollar activity profile in the stability test up to 100k cycles. The overall loss of the activity was recorded to be as low as 17% of the initial value. The ORR activity increased in the initial 20k cycles because the freshly prepared Pt-ML did not entirely encompass the whole Pd core, but it was integrated to a full coverage with a more stable configuration during the potential cycling owing to its self-healing property. Then, the activity decreased at a much slower rate than the standard Pt/C because the Pd-Pt core-shell structure due to its structural self-retaining property remained intact and impeded the electrochemical Ostwald ripening of the entire particles. Changes in the morphology and configuration of Pt-ML were mapped by combining our experimental investigation with model analyses. The proposed self-healing and self-retaining mechanisms account for the structure-dependent stability in the ORR and play cornerstone roles in formulating ORR core-shell electrocatalysts.									15	1	0	0	0	0	16			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000451600200014

Cysteine 65 is homologous to cysteine 20 of the D. gigas hydrogenase, and this cysteine is a ligand to the proximal [4Fe-4S] cluster, All three mutants retained some hydrogenase activity, All three mutants studied had H-2 oxidation-to-H-2 evolution activity ratios with whole cells of approximately 1.5, compared with 46 for the wild type, The changes preferentially deplete H-2 oxidation activity, while having less effect on evolution, The K64,65C-->S hydrogenase was partially purified and had a specific activity for the evolution reaction that was 22% that of the wild type, while the oxidation-specific activity was 2% that of the wild type, Because cysteine 65 provides a ligand to the proximal [4Fe-4S] cluster, this cluster can be altered without entirely eliminating enzyme activity, Likewise, the detection of H-2 evolution and H-2 oxidation activities with whole cells and membranes of the K294C-->S and K297C-->S mutants indicates that the [3Fe-4S] cluster can also be altered or possibly eliminated without entirely eliminating enzyme activity, Membranes with K294C-->S or K297C-->S hydrogenase mere uninhibited by O-2 in H-2 oxidation and uninhibited by H-2 in H-2 evolution, Wild-type membranes and membranes with K64,65C-->S hydrogenase were both sensitive to these inhibitors, These data indicate that the [3Fe-4S] cluster controls the reversible inhibition of hydrogenase activity by O-2 or H-2.									34	3	2	0	18	0	39			0021-9193			WOS:A1995RH81000010	7608067

Usually, noble metal deposited as a co-catalyst on CdS surface is required to achieve high photocatalytic activity. Thus, replacing noble metal via cheap and easy synthesis co-catalyst would be of great value for developing cost-effective photocatalyst. In this work, noble-metal-free defective Mo15S19 combined with CdS-diethylenetriamine (DETA) hybrid makes efficient separation of photoinduced carriers, and more importantly, reduced overpotential for hydrogen evolution reaction, thereby improved catalytic hydrogen evolution performance of designed composite. In particular, 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA systems exhibited a high rate of hydrogen production, reaching 3.61 mmol g(-1)h(-1), which is similar with 3%Pt/CdS-DETA and 9.5 and 2.19 times as high as that of CdS nanoparticles (NPs) and CdS-DETA, respectively. At the same time, photocorrosion resistance of 3%Mo15S19/CdS-DETA systems was dramatically improved. According to DFT theoretical calculations, it was found that the enhanced photocatalytic performance and anticorrosion are mainly due to efficient transfer of photoexcited electrons from CdS-DETA to Mo15S19.									34	3	0	0	2	0	34			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000454617200059

Herein, the N-doped porous graphene is coupled with Ni3Fe alloys (Ni3Fe/NPG) by the phase transformation method. By optimizing the Ni3Fe alloy content and nanoparticle size, the bifunctional Ni3Fe/NPG-1 electrocatalyst with a super-high specific surface area (1081.8 m(2) g(-1)), ultralow alloy loading content (2.4 wt %), and the best electrocatalytic activity and stability is obtained, which exhibits a low overpotential of 329 mV to achieve a 10 mA cm(-2) current density for the OER, and positive onset and half-wave potentials of 0.874 and 0.83 V for the ORR, superior to the state-of-the-art Pt/C and RuO2 and most highly active bifunctional catalysts reported to date. Furthermore, density functional theory calculation results prove that the synergetic effect is beneficial to favorable conjugated electronic environments and increasing OER/ORR catalytic activities. Impressively, the liquid ZAB with the optimized bifunctional catalyst shows a high voltage of 1.50 V, maximum power density of 143 mW cm(-2), outstanding cycling and mechanical stability, and superior charging-discharging performance. More importantly, the Ni3Fe/NPG-1 based all-solid-state ZAB also presents a superb open-circuit voltage of 1.45 V, high peak power density of 50.0 mW cm(-2), and cyclic durability for 150 cycles. The designed air-cathode and competitive catalytic performance contribute significant enlightenment toward the next-generation electrochemical devices.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2574-0962			WOS:000618839200070

The present study employs first principles calculations to demonstrate that the band gap energies of porous h-BN (p-BN) can be tuned by carbon doping to levels appropriate for the absorption of visible-light, and that the conduction band and valence band match well with the potentials of both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. Importantly, a strategy of carbon doping to improve the energy level of valence band maximum is also proposed. Moreover, the carbon-doped p-BN exhibits good separation between photogenerated electrons/holes and structural stability at high temperatures. The DFT results help the design of high-performance two-dimensional photocatalysts that avoid the use of metals.									19	3	0	0	1	0	19				2513-0390		WOS:000463986600009

Thylakoids are multilamellar structures, which express photosystems I and II, cytochromes and ATP synthase necessary for the light-dependent reaction of photosynthesis. Myelin is a multilamellar structure that surrounds many axons in the nervous system and has long been believed to act simply as an insulator. However, it has been shown that myelin has a trophic role, conveying nutrients to the axons and producing ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, it is tempting to presume that both membranous structures, although distant in the evolution tree, share not only a morphological but also a functional similarity, acting in feeding ATP synthesized by the ATP synthase to the centre of the multilamellar structure. Therefore, both molecular structures may represent a convergent evolution of life on Earth to fulfill fundamentally similar functions.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1				2046-2441		WOS:000729946100003	34905702

Biofilms are often thought to require high levels of cooperation because extracellular polymeric substances are a shared resource produced by one cell that can be used by others. Here we examine this hypothesis by using a detailed individual-based simulation of a biofilm to investigate the outcome of evolutionary competitions between strains that differ in their level of polymer production. Our model includes a biochemical description of the carbon fluxes for growth and polymer production, and it explicitly calculates diffusion-reaction effects and the resulting solute gradients in the biofilm. An emergent property of these simple but realistic mechanistic assumptions is a strong evolutionary advantage to extracellular polymer production. Polymer secretion is altruistic to cells above a focal cell: it pushes later generations in their lineage up and out into better oxygen conditions, but it harms others; polymer production suffocates neighboring nonpolymer producers. This property, analogous to vertical growth in plants, suggests that polymer secretion provides a strong competitive advantage to cell lineages within mixed-genotype biofilms: global cooperation is not required. Our model fundamentally changes how biofilms are expected to respond to changing social conditions; the presence of multiple strains in a biofilm should promote rather than inhibit polymer secretion.									345	3	3	0	283	0	353			0027-8424			WOS:000243761100036	17210916

X-ray diffraction gives typical birnessite-type patterns, with diffraction peaks at 2 theta = similar to 12.01 degrees and 24.7 degrees assigned to (001) and (002) planes. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra suggest differences in the stability of Mn(III) species in manganese-oxide layer, which is more stable in birnessite samples with divalent cations than samples with monovalent cations. The activity of samples for an anodic O-2-evolution reaction is considerably affected by electrostatic potential and Lewis acidity of the monovalent cation, following the sequence of Li+ > Na+ > K+ > Rb+ > Cs+. While for samples with intercalating divalent alkaline-earth cations, there was slightly lower activity for O-2 evolution, which may be correlated to different stability of Mn(III) species in the birnessite layers. In addition, we observed much higher O-2-evolution activity at an overpotential of ca. 220 - 230 mV if the samples were heat-treated between 300 - 500 degrees C once they were electrolytically deposited as LiMnO, films. Clearly dry heating causes changes in both the crystalline structure and electronic structure of manganese-oxide layers, as indicated by associated changes in water-oxidation activity.

Due to their high sensitivity to the redox state of the environment,the isotopic compositions of Fe and Mo as well as variations have been widely used to probe the redox conditions and the evolution of ancient ocean chemistry in favor of improved analytical techniques. Here, we summarized isotopic fractionation mechanisms and natural distribution of both iron and molybdenum isotopes,and further we summarized and partially reinterpreted the redox evolution of ancient oceans through time based on available Fe-Mo data compiled in this study. The process that causes the largest iron isotope fractionation is redox reaction and the iron in oxidation state is generally enriched in ~(56)Fe. Biotic and abiotic pyrite formations also produce a large Fe isotope fractionations. Isotopic fractionation of molybdenum in seawater is mainly caused by the adsorption process of dissolved Mo onto ferromanganese oxides or hydroxides in sediments. Fe-Mn (hydro) oxides tend to adsorb isotopically light molybdenum resulting in the isotopic composition of Mo in seawater heavier. However,the Mo sinks in euxinic settings cause almost no molybdenum isotope fractionation. The Fe-Mo isotope isotopic records through geological timegenerally suggest similar ocean redox evolution : Oceans older than 2. 3 Ga was mainly dominated by ferruginous condition, and there was a slight increase in oxygen content between 2. 6 and 2. 5 Ga. Earth' s surface was initially oxidized during 2. 3 to 1. 8 Ga, during which euxinic deposition of sulfide was elevated. Euxinic waters may have expanded greatly between 1. 8 and 0.8 Ga, and after that, Earth's surface had being gradually oxidized and the euxinic waters shrank substantially. Finally, suggestions are proposed for further work on the Fe-Mo isotope research in the context of ancient ocean chemistry.			Fe元素在自然界储量丰富,而Mo元素则是海水中储量最丰富的过渡金属元素。由于Fe,Mo对其所在环境的氧化还原条件非常敏感,近年来随着分析技术的进步,Fe与Mo同位素组成和变化被广泛用于鉴别古代海洋氧化还原状态及其演化。系统总结了古海洋化学研究中Fe与Mo同位素分馏机理和自然分布,并对当前获得的Fe-Mo同位素地史记录及其所指示的古海洋氧化还原状态进行了归纳与部分解释。造成Fe同位素分馏最明显的过程是氧化还原反应,氧化态的Fe通常具有更重的Fe同位素组成;此外,微生物作用及非生物作用下的黄铁矿生成过程也会产生明显的Fe同位素分馏。在海洋环境中Mo同位素的分馏主要与沉积物中铁锰(氢)氧化物吸附过程有关,铁锰(氢)氧化物吸附Mo的过程中,铁锰(氢)氧化物中倾向富集同位素较轻的Mo,造成海水中Mo同位素偏重,而硫化环境下的Mo沉积几乎不造成Mo同位素的分馏。Fe-Mo同位素的地史记录很好地说明了地质历史各时期海洋的氧化还原状态,在2.3Ga以前海洋主要为铁化的状态,其中在2.6~2.5Ga时氧含量略有增加;2.3~1.8Ga之间地球表面初步氧化,硫化物沉积增加;1.8~0.8Ga时海洋中的硫化环境得到了扩张;0.8Ga以后地球表层逐步氧化,硫化水体消退。最后,对古海洋化学研究中Fe-Mo同位素研究未来的工作重点给予了展望。						0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1001-8166			CSCD:4978082

Eosin Y (EY)-sensitized alpha-[AlSiW11(H2O)O-39](5-) (AlSiW11) (an Al3+ substituted Keggin polyoxometalate (POM)) for the hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm) has been carried out in the presence of triethanolamine as electron donor and Pt as co-catalyst. EY can coordinate with AlSiW11. The coordination association between AlSiW11 and EY is beneficial to the charge transfer from EY to AlSiW11 and to stability of EY. The system displays efficient and stable photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The average apparent quantum efficiency and turnover number of EY during 20 h irradiation (lambda > 420 nm) are 10.3% and 473, respectively. The highest quantum efficiency amounts to 28.0% under 520 nm monochromatic light irradiation.

In the electrochemical system, an ITO anode and cathode were immersed in 1 wt % SiO2 solution (pH 6.8). The electrodes were set to 15 V at room temperature under different durations of electrochemical treatment. The properties of the cathodic ITO film were analyzed after treatment. The ITO films varied from transparent to black and gray during the treatment. In2O3 underwent reduction and transformed to In, as indicated by X-ray diffractometry. The surface morphologies of the ITO samples revealed that the ITO crystals were damaged. The damage resulted in numerous aggregated particles forming on the film surface after electrochemical treatment. The major elements of the particles were confirmed to be oxygen and In. The electrical resistance of the treated ITO considerably increased because of the damage to the In2O3 crystals. The simulation of the diffusion model and experimental results indicated that the electrochemical reaction rate of ITO was controlled by the reactant diffusion in the ITO film.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1023-1935	1608-3342		WOS:000516575400024

We present an interface engineering strategy for constructing a bifunctional electrode material for an efficient water splitting process. Designed cadmium sulphide and Prussian blue nanorods (CdS-NRs@PBNPs) heterostructures acts as bifunctional electrocatalyst improved water splitting performance, for both HER and OER. For HER, the optimized hybrid CdS-NRs@PBNPs (1:1) showed significantly a low overpotentials of 126 mV and 181 mV at current densities of 10 mA cm-2 and 20 mA cm-2 respectively. For OER it displays an overpotential of 250 mV and 316 mV at current densities of 10 mA cm-2 and 20 mA cm-2. Additionally, the CdS-NRs@PBNPs (1:1) has demonstrated long-term stability. The hybrid's enhanced OER and HER activity is attributable to a synergetic impact between CdS-NRs and PBNPs, as well as the active site modification due to the presence of Cadmium and iron in the hybrid.

Membrane electrode assembly (MEA) has been the most primary part of the conventional polymer electrolyte fuel cells as well as unitized regenerative fuel cells. This paper summarizes the important steps and latest developments in the preparation of the assembly such as membrane treatment, preparation of electrodes followed by hot pressing for low temperature (<100 degrees C) polymer electrolyte fuel cells and unitized regenerative fuel cells. Various possibilities in the membrane selection for the assemblies are detailed out and their performances are compared with respect to the preparation methods. Catalysts play a very important role in supporting oxygen reduction as well as evolution reaction and primarily differentiate the MEAs of the cells. Hence, they are tabulated along with the possible supports. Also, importance of wet proofing the gas diffusion backing along with preparation of microporous layer with different materials and processes is also reviewed. Hot pressing which is conventionally used for preparing the assemblies makes a great difference when used with optimized operating parameters such as pressure, temperature and time during the pressing. A comparison between the various techniques used for MEA fabrication is summarized and is believed to be useful for researchers. In addition to an extended review on the preparative techniques for MEA manufacturing, the authors underline the performance of a unitized regenerative fuel cell (area = 22.5 cm(2)) by incorporating the salient steps involved during the preparation of membrane electrode assemblies.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1364-0321	1879-0690		WOS:000581605600055		
B	Singh, N.; Schwartzentruber, T.E.								Non-Boltzmann vibrational energy distribution model for shock-heated flows								AIAA Scitech 2020 Forum								10 pp.	10 pp.						2020	2020	Dissociation is strongly coupled to the vibrational energy population of the dissociating gas. High-temperature excitation results in the overpopulation of high-energy states which enhances the dissociation rate as high-vibrational energy states are strongly favored to dissociation. Dissociation then results in the depletion of the high-energy population and consequently a balance between excitation and dissociation is reached resulting in quasi-steady state (QSS). QSS is characterized by time invariant non-Boltzmann depleted distributions and therefore reduced dissociation rates relative to the equilibrium estimates. In the kinetics models developed thus far, either the non-Boltzmann effects are ignored or added as pre-factors in an ad-hoc manner to an equilibrium rate constant. Recently, using ah initio potential energy surfaces, direct molecular simulation (DMS) approach has simulated the evolution of air species at the conditions representative of post-shock conditions. Based on the DMS data, a simple physics based model to characterize the non-Boltzmann distributions is developed. The model is compared with zero dimensional DMS simulations for nitrogen and oxygen at constant temperature (isothermal) and constant energy (adiabatic) conditions. The non-Boltzmann distributions are then used in conjunction with state-specific dissociation rate constants to derive a non-equilibrium continuum dissociation model.

We employed a sol-gel route, in which a solution of Ru(III) and BI(III) in a mixture of citric acid and ethylene glycol was heated to form a polymeric precursor, followed by an annealing at higher temperatures during various periods. The oxide obtained was identified by X-ray diffraction analysis. The results revealed that the formation of homogeneous oxide with a single pyrochlore structure phase occured at or above 650 degreesC. Sample powders consisted of fine grains with homogeneous morphology and an average size of about 0.5 mum. This new preparation procedure yielded an electrode material with improved electrochemical activity compared to those elaborated through conventional methods.

The model nicely reproduces the main observational constraints of the solar neighborhood, and the calculated elemental abundances at the time of the solar birth are in excellent agreement with the solar abundances. By the inclusion of metallicity-dependent yields for the whole range of stellar masses we follow the evolution of 76 isotopes of all the chemical elements between hydrogen and zinc. Those results are compared with a large and recent body of observational data, and we discuss in detail the implications for stellar nucleosynthesis.									91	1	2	0	0	0	93			1432-0746			WOS:000169942100034		
J	Ma, Xiangjuan; Gao, Yang; Huang, Hanping; Ding, Jingfeng; Xia, Huilong								TREATMENT OF PAPERMAKING TOBACCO SHEET WASTEWATER BY ELECTROCOAGULATION AND BIODEGRADABILITY ENHANCEMENT								ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL				16	12			2781	2790		10.30638/eemj.2017.287				DEC 2017	2017	Papermaking tobacco sheet wastewater exhibits high content of fine suspended solids (SS), intensive color and low biodegradability. Through the process of electrocoagulation (EC) using aluminum anode and stainless steel net cathode, the performance of wastewater treatment and the evolution of the main components in wastewater were examined. Maintaining the pH of wastewater, with 40 mA/cm(2) of current density, 2.5 g/L of NaCl for a reaction of 6 min duration, 66.1% of the total chemical oxygen demand (CODt), 95.7% of turbidity, 91.7% of color and 97.5% of SS were removed. The corresponding aluminum anode and energy consumption for per kg COD removed were calculated as 39.56 g and 0.62 kWh, respectively. As the main recalcitrant components of wastewater, 40.5% of nicotine, 21.4% of beta-nicotyrine, and 47.5% of solanone were removed respectively. On the contrary, the process of EC proved to be unsuccessful in removing the organic acids such as oleic acid and palmitic acid. It was however observed that, the BOD5 on CODt ratio of wastewater increased from 0.075 to 0.426, indicating that the effluent was more suitable for biological treatment. Thus, electrocoagulation has proven to be an instrumental alternative for the pretreatment of papermaking tobacco sheet wastewater.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1582-9596	1843-3707		WOS:000423792300012

We examined the potential influence of irradiance on patterns of distribution of four Cosmarium strains isolated from various climatic zones and cultured long term (>15years) under a constant temperature-light regime. All the Cosmarium strains demonstrated physiological responses that were consistent with the light intensity prevailing at their source location, confirming that these responses are genetically preserved, as concluded from chlorophyll fluorescence and oxygen evolution rates measurements. Addition of inhibitors of chloroplast-encoded protein synthesis (chloramphenicol and streptomycin) and violaxanthin de-epoxidase (dithiothreitol) indicated that the Cosmarium strains developed sun- or shade-plant protection strategies, in accordance with the climate at their sampling sites. The polar Cosmarium strains exhibited a shade-plant strategyto suffer some photoinhibition, but acquire increasing protection from photoinhibited PSII centers, whereas the tropical strains displayed a sun-plant strategyto counteract photoinhibition of PSII by a high rate of repair of photoinhibited PSII reaction centers and a high xanthophyll cycle turnover.									15	0	0	0	14	0	16			0031-8655	1751-1097		WOS:000329304200022	23581815

Extensive characterization techniques such as XRD, BET, SEM, TEM, H-2-TPR and XPS were employed for analyzing the structure-performance relationship between physicochemical properties, such as specific surface area, vacancy/lattice oxygen and their mobility, reduction property and catalytic activity. Results indicated that the degradation activity of MnO2 catalyst greatly hinges on materials intrinsic properties, namely the vacancy oxygen generation, lattice oxygen content and their reduction behaviors. alpha-MnO2 exhibited the best catalytic activity (0.24 mu mol/min @ 240 degrees C) among the obtained MnO2 materials; however, its cycle stability was inferior to that of delta-MnO2 catalyst owing to the different moderating effect of potassium ions remained within the tunnels or mezzanines structure. In addition, delta-MnO2 showed an easiest reduction property among all the manganese oxides investigated. The findings will shed lights on designing of Mn-based catalysts with a higher VOCs combustion capacity.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000604558800006

Effective electrocatalyst with low dynamic overpotential and long durability is an important factor in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In present work, a cobalt oxide derived from zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) was anchored on bacterial cellulose (BC) to construct a ZIF-67/BC nanostructure firstly. Then, trace amount of palladium and platinum bimetal were deposited on the surface of ZIF-67/BC for various times via electrodeposition to form xPtPd@ZIF-67/BC (x was the electrodeposition time). The optimized electrocatalyst, 10PtPd@ZIF-67/BC with 0.07 wt% Pt and 0.23 wt% Pd loading showed superior electrochemical activity and HER performance in both acidic and alkaline media. The overpotential (@ 10 mA cm(-2)) was 59 and 33 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively. The corresponding Tafel slope was 17 and 87 mV dec(-1), respectively. The 10PtPd@ZIF-67/BC also displayed a good durability after 5000 cycles and 24 h of continuous electrolysis in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH. The ZIF-67/BC template could effectively enhance the H2O adsorption and improve dispersion of noble metalic nanoparticles. The presence of Pd enhanced hydrogen adsorption and further increased the electrocatalytic performance of 10PtPd@ZIF-67/BC. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Using multilayers of Photosystem II membrane particles, we investigated the time course of the disassembly of the Mn complex initiated by a temperature jump from 25degreesC to 47degreesC and terminated by rapid cooling after distinct heating periods. We monitored polarographically the oxygen-evolution activity, the amount of the Y-D(ox) radical and of released Mn2+ by EPR spectroscopy, and the structure of the Mn complex by x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS, EXAFS). Using 4 novel approach to analyze time-resolved EXAFS data, we identify three distinct phases of the disassembly process: (1) Loss of the oxygen-evolution activity and reduction of Y-D(ox) occur simultaneously (k(1) = 1.0 min(-1)). EXAFS spectra reveal the concomitant loss of an absorber-backscatterer interaction between heavy atoms separated by similar to3.3 Angstrom, possibly related to Ca release. (2) Subsequently, two Mn(III) or Mn(IV) ions seemingly separated by similar to2.7 Angstrom in the native complex are reduced to Mn(II) and released (k(2) = 0.18 min(-1)). The x-ray absorption spectroscopy data is highly suggestive that the two unreleased Mn ions form a di-mu-oxo bridged Mn(III)(2) complex. (3) Finally, the tightly-bound Mn-2(mu-O)(2) unit is slowly reduced and released (k(3) = 0.014 min(-1)).									52	1	2	0	38	0	56			0006-3495	1542-0086		WOS:000183123700061	12547817

J	Yamazaki, Yukari; Azami, Keisuke; Katoh, Ryuzi; Yamazaki, Suzuko					Yamazaki, Yukari/0000-0001-9373-8618			Developing Active TiO2 Nanorods by Examining the Influence of Morphological Changes from Nanorods to Nanoparticles on Photocatalytic Activity								ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS				1	10			5927	5935		10.1021/acsanm.8b01617				OCT 2018	2018	We synthesized rutile TiO2 nanorods with high crystallinity, i.e., degree of crystallinity greater than ca. 90%, by using a hydrothermal method and studied the effect of the morphological change from rod shape to subsphere by the subsequent thermal treatment. The photocatalytic activity was estimated for O-2 evolution from water oxidation because this reaction was hardly affected by the specific surface area of photocatalysts. Thermal desorption and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry measurements suggested the decomposition of residual glycolic acid in TiO2 nanorods at 272 and 590 degrees C. Observation with scanning electron microscopy and physical properties such as specific surface area and crystallite size indicated deformation of the rod shape to subsphere by the calcination above 600 degrees C. Time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements have revealed that the TiO2 nanorods possess the longest lifetime of photogenerated electrons among all samples. However, the O-2 evolution rate of the TiO2 nanorods was much lower than subsphere TiO2 obtained by calcination at 800 degrees C (TiO2-800). Photodeposition of Pt and PbO2 showed that the oxidation and the reduction sites were separated on TiO2-800 whereas their deposition distributed uniformly on the TiO2 nanorods. The Pt loading on the surface of the TiO2 nanorods increased the O-2 evolution rate whereas that on TiO2-800 was hardly affected, indicating that the Pt loading enhances the charge separation on the surface of the TiO2 nanorods. Therefore, the lower photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 nanorods is ascribed to the recombination process on the surface. The suppression of the recombination on the surface and thereby the utilization of the long lifetime of the photogenerated electrons is the key factor to develop superior TiO2 nanorods for photocatalysis.									14	0	0	0	0	0	13			2574-0970			WOS:000461401100061

In this work, we show that the surface Ti3+ defects in SrTiO3 (STO), characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, directly impact the photocatalytic activity of STO. O-2 species are found to absorb preferentially on Ti3+ defect sites. Hydrogen evolution under ambient air diminishes with the increase in the concentration of surface Ti3+. This is explained by the over-accumulation of Pt cocatalysts on the site of surface Ti3+ defects after the removal of adsorbed O-2.

However, its solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency is much below the industrial requirement (10%). This situation has stimulated intensive efforts to improve photocatalytic overall water splitting (namely, simultaneously providing unassisted oxidation and reduction of water), leading to the invention of novel catalysts in the recent years. The evaluation of these recent progresses constitutes this review article, with emphasis on the strategies employed for the development of catalysts. The catalysts were deeply reviewed and were classified into four types: (a) perovskite compounds, (b) metal oxides (sulfides and nitrides), (c) Bi- and In-based materials, and (d) multicomponent catalysts. Furthermore, the challenges that remain with the process and catalysts and the potential advances were discussed as an outlook for future research.									48	5	0	0	3	0	48			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000457751100004

The visible photoluminescence at room temperature from a-SiOx:H matrixes with different compositions, including different bonding environments for H atoms, has been studied in the as-deposited and annealed states up to 900 degrees C. Three commonly reported PL bands centered around 1.7, 2.1, and 2.9 eV have been detected from the same type of a-SiOx:H material, only by varying the oxygen content (x = 1.35, 1.65, and 2). Temperature quenching experiments are crucial to distinguish the 1.7 eV band, fully consistent with bandtail-to-bandtail recombination, from the radiative defect luminescence mechanisms attributed either to defects related to Si-OH groups (2.9 eV) or to oxygen-vacancy defects (2.1 eV). In the latter case, a red-shift of the PL peak energy as a function of annealing temperature is probably attributed to some matrix-induced strain effect.

The measured patterns and their evolution are interpreted via atomistic simulations. Described are quantitative observations of the changes in peak position, intensity and half width of the 111 diffraction peak of a palladium catalyst caused by modifying the gaseous environment. The results of the measurements are in line with an atomistic model proposed earlier and prove that the measured average lattice constant of palladium clusters evolves according to their surface relaxation. The evolution of the measured peak intensity suggests surface ordering effects and was used to propose a detailed structural model of nanocrystalline metal particles. The transition of palladium into beta-Pd-H in hydrogen under normal conditions was used as a structure probe and provided evidence for the presence of icosahedral clusters in a highly dispersed catalyst. The icosahedral phase is not significantly modified under hydrogen atmosphere and does not transform into the beta hydride.									50	0	0	0	1	0	50			1600-5767			WOS:000089515600010

Indeed, the need for cellular regulation of DNA led to the evolution of metallonucleases to catalyze and repair DNA strand breaks. Moreover, inorganic constructs such as cisplatin and bimetallic rhodium acetate exert antitumor activity by inner-sphere coordination to DNA. Because binding and cleavage of DNA is at the heart of cellular transcription and translation, it is an obvious target for therapeutic intervention and the development of diagnostic structural probes. To this end, new metal complexes have been designed that utilize or create open coordination positions for DNA binding and hydrolysis, generate reactive oxygen-containing species or other radicals for DNA oxidation, or perform direct redox reactions with DNA. The recent emerging themes are the development of bifunctional architectures containing multiple metal-binding or reactive sites, specialized ligand implementation, or incorporation of site-specific targeting substructures. This review describes their employment in novel reaction strategies that do not require bimolecular cofactors and as site-specific probes or cleavage agents.									278	6	0	0	91	2	285			1367-5931	1879-0402		WOS:000228607700007	15811797

In this study, sulfidated zero-valent iron (S-ZVI) was found to be able to simultaneously sequestrate these HA-complexed HMs. Specially, the HA-complexed Pb(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), and As(V) could be completely removed by S-ZVI within 60 min, while only 35-50% of them could be sequestrated within 72 h by unsulfidated ZVI. Interestingly, different from the S-ZVI corrosion behavior, the kinetics of HM sequestration by S-ZVI consisted of an initial slow reaction stage (or a lag phase) and then a fairly rapid reaction process. Characterization results indicated that forming metal sulfides controlled the HM sequestration at the first stage, whereas the enhanced ZVI corrosion and thus-improved adsorption and/or coprecipitation by iron hydroxides governed the second stage. Both metal-oxygen and metal-sulfur bonds in the solid phase could be confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis. Moreover, the transformation of S species from SO42-, SO32-, and S-2(2-) to S2- under reducing conditions could allow the sequestrated HMs to remain stable over a long period.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000776699100025	35174702

Tentatively named ''Magnetobacterium bavaricum,'' this bacterium is evolutionarily distant from all other phylogenetically characterized magnetotactic bacteria and contains unusually high numbers of magnetosomes (up to 1,000 magnetosomes per cell). The spatial distribution in the sediment was studied, and up to 7 x 10(5) active cells per cm3 were found in the microaerobic zone. Considering its average volume (25.8 +/- 4.1 mum3) and relative abundance (0.64 +/- 0.17%), ''M. bavaricum'' may account for approximately 30% of the microbial biovolume and may therefore be a dominant fraction of the microbial community in this layer. Its microhabitat and its high content of sulfur globules and magnetosomes suggest that this organism has an iron-dependent way of energy conservation which depends on balanced gradients of oxygen and sulfide.									193	16	0	0	146	1	207			0099-2240	1098-5336		WOS:A1993LP83500009	16349008

Here, we developed a novel hybrid catalyst with Ni nanosheet forests anchored on carbon paper. The hybrid catalyst exhibits high efficiency in electrooxidation of HMF to FDCA coupling with H-2 production in high purity. The Ni nanosheets have small crystal grain sizes with abundant edges, which is able to deliver an efficient HMF oxidation to FDCA (selectivity >99 %) at low potential of 1.36 V-RHE with high stability. The post-reaction structure analysis reveals the Ni nanosheets would transfer electrons to carbon and readily turn into NiOx and Ni(OH)(x) during the reaction. DFT results suggest high valence Ni species would facilitate the chemical adsorption (activation) of HMF revealing the reaction pathway.

Kerogens were isolated from their mineral matrix in order to obtain a complete recovery of the insoluble residue. Experiments were conducted under anhydrous conditions in order to calculate atomic balances for carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and sulfur. The pyrolysis products were fractionated by molecular weight and relative thermal stability. The kinetic scheme comprises four kinds of reactions: depolymerization reactions for kerogen and heavy products such as resins and asphaltenes. This type of reaction involves the most labile compounds, which are likely to be generated by C-O or/and C-S bond cracking. It produces heavy soluble compounds but very small amounts of gases and pure liquid hydrocarbons. C-C bond cracking of C6+ saturated chains. These reactions occur at higher apparent activation energies than the previous ones. They generate shorter aliphatic chains but again, very low amounts of methane and ethane. demethylation reactions of aromatic structures such as C-9-C-13 compounds, polycondensed C-14+ nuclei and the insoluble residue.

The kinetic scheme involves 11 chemical classes fractionated by molecular weight and thermal stability; among them 3 are stable (methane, a mixture comprising benzene/toluene/xylenes/naphthalene and coke), 8 are unstable (ethane, C3-C5, C-9-C-13 aromatics, C6-C-13 saturates, C-14+ unstable aromatics, C-14 + condensed aromatics and precoke). Although the two kerogens selected in this study are degraded with the same apparent activation energy and preexponential factor, stoichiometric coefficients must be specifically determined for each equation of the kinetic scheme in which kerogen cracking is included.									339	128	3	0	6	2	463			0146-6380			WOS:A1992KG70400015

Herein, a universal method is developed for the preparation of M-mTiO(2) spheres and their photocatalytic mechanism is unveiled. Fe-mTiO(2), Co-mTiO(2), Ni-mTiO(2), Cu-mTiO(2) spheres are successfully prepared by the developed method. Among all M-mTiO(2) samples, the Cu-mTiO(2) catalyst exhibits reversible photoactivation phenomenon during photocatalysis. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate on photoactivated Cu-mTiO(2) can reach 3.31 mmol g(-1) h(-1), which is much higher than those of other M-mTiO(2) and is 28.3 times of that of the mTiO(2). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the photoactivation of Cu-mTiO(2) is associated with the facile formation of oxygen vacancies on Cu-mTiO(2). The photoactivation induces the active site change and the light absorption increase of Cu-mTiO(2). The active site change has the dominant role for the enhancement of photocatalytic performance. On the photoactivated Cu-mTiO(2), the hydrogen production is through a reverse hydrogen spillover process. Our findings not only provide a universal method for the preparation of M-mTiO(2) but also deepen the understanding about the photoactivation and the hydrogen production mechanism.

Here, using density functional theory calculations, we present a theoretical study on tuning the band gap via biaxial strain and electric field to enhance photocatalytic performance of ZnO monolayer. Our theoretical calculations show that ZnO monolayer at 10% biaxial tensile strain has suitable band edge positions for photocatalytic water splitting, and its band gap reduces to 2.70 eV, which is smaller than that of the other widely studied photocatalysts. Meanwhile, the oxidation capacity of the ZnO monolayer at 10% biaxial tensile strain is increased, which is beneficial for improving the efficiency of the photocatalytic water splitting reaction. Thus, the ZnO monolayer at 10% biaxial tensile strain is a promising water splitting photocatalyst. Interestingly, the ZnO monolayers at 10% and 7.5% biaxial compressive strains are suitable for hydrogen production but not for oxygen evolution and can be considered to be a Z-type photocatalyst. Furthermore, we find that an external electric field has only a weak effect for enhancing photocatalytic performance. Our theoretical work shows that biaxial strain can effectively enhance the performance of the ZnO monolayer for photocatalytic water splitting.									18	1	0	0	2	0	19			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000472176900124

The ionomer-free and ionomer-containing thin-film catalyst layers are composed of Pt black and carbon-supported Pt catalysts of different metal loadings (5 and 20 wt%). The simplest El spectrum consisting of an arc or a semi-circle is obtained at high potentials with ionomer-free Pt catalyst layers. The most complex spectrum consisting of a high frequency (HF) arc and two semi-circles is observed in the mixed diffusion-controlled region of the ionomer-containing catalyst layer with high loading of carbon-supported Pt. The nature of the El spectrum is decided by the constituents of the thin-film catalyst layer and by the operating potential. The evolution of the El spectra with ionomer and carbon contents is underlined. The effect of rotation rate (rpm) of the electrode on the impedance spectrum is also investigated. A series of equivalent circuits is required to completely describe the El spectra of ORR. The kinetic parameters and the electrochemical surface area of the catalysts are derived from the impedance spectrum. (C) The Author(s) 2015. Published by ECS.

BIOCHEMISTRY				40	36			10832	10838		10.1021/bi011052j				SEP 11 2001	2001	The ferritins are a class of iron storage and detoxification proteins that play a central role in the biological management of iron. These proteins have a catalytic site, "the ferroxidase site", located on the H-type subunit that facilitates the oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) by O-2. Measurements during the past 10 years on a number of vertebrate ferritins have provided evidence that H2O2 is produced at this diiron ferroxidase site. Recently reported experiments using three different analytical methods with horse spleen ferritin (HoSF) have failed to detect H2O2 production in this protein [Lindsay, S., Brosnahan, D., and Watt, G.D. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 3340-3347]. These findings contrast with earlier results reporting H2O2 production in HoSF [Xu, B., and Chasteen, N.D. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 19965-19970]. Here a sensitive fluorescence assay and an assay based on O-2 evolution in the presence of catalase were used to demonstrate that H2O2 is produced in HoSF as previously reported. However, because of the relatively few H-chain ferroxidase sites in HoSF and the reaction of H2O2 with the protein, H2O2 is more difficult to detect in this ferritin than in recombinant human H-chain ferritin (EuHF). The proper sequence of addition of reagents is important for measurement of the total amount of H2O2 produced during the ferroxidation reaction.									61	1	0	0	52	0	62			0006-2960			WOS:000170877200012	11535059

Recent studies have shown that LG can react rapidly with hydroxyl (OH) radicals in the aqueous phase despite many mass balance receptor models assuming it to be inert during atmospheric transport. In the current study, aqueous-phase photooxidation of LG by OH radicals was performed in the laboratory. The reaction kinetics and products were monitored by aerosol time-off-light chemical ionization mass spectrometry (Aerosol ToF-IMS). Approximately 50 reaction products were detected by the Aerosol ToF-CIMS during the photooxidation experiments, representing one of the most detailed product studies yet performed. By following the evolution of mass defects of product peaks, unique trends of adding oxygen (+O) and removing hydrogen (-2H) were observed among the products detected, providing useful information for determining potential reaction mechanisms and sequences. Additionally, bond-scission reactions take place, leading to reaction intermediates with lower carbon numbers. We introduce a data analysis framework where the average oxidation state (OSc) is plotted against a novel molecular property: double-bond-equivalence-to-carbon ratio (DBE/#C). The trajectory of LG photooxidation on this plot suggests formation of polycarbonyl intermediates and their subsequent conversion to carboxylic acids as a general reaction trend. We also determined the rate constant of LG with OH radicals at room temperature to be 1.08 +/- 0.16x10(9)M(-1)s(-1). By coupling an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) to the system, we observed a rapid decay of the mass fraction of organic signals at mass-to-charge ratio 60 (f60), corresponding closely to the LG decay monitored by the Aerosol ToF-CIMS. The trajectory of LG photooxidation on a f44-f60 correlation plot matched closely to literature field measurement data. This implies that aqueous-phase photooxidation might be partially contributing to aging of BB particles in the ambient atmosphere.									56	2	0	0	28	0	59			1680-7316	1680-7324		WOS:000341993100015

While presently global H-2 production is predominated by fossil-fuel feedstocks, for future widespread utilization it is of paramount importance to produce H-2 in a decarbonized manner. To this end, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has been proposed to be a highly desirable approach with minimal negative impact on the environment. Both semiconductor light-absorbers and hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) catalysts are essential components of an efficient PEC cell. It is well documented that loading electrocatalysts on semiconductor photoelectrodes plays significant roles in accelerating the HER/OER kinetics, suppressing surface recombination, reducing overpotentials needed to accomplish HER/OER, and extending the operational lifetime of semiconductors. Herein, how electrocatalyst coupling influences the PEC performance of semiconductor photoelectrodes is outlined. The focus is then placed on the major strategies developed so far for semiconductor/electrocatalyst coupling, including a variety of dry processes and wet chemical approaches. This Review provides a comprehensive account of advanced methodologies adopted for semiconductor/electrocatalyst coupling and can serve as a guideline for the design of efficient and stable semiconductor photoelectrodes for use in water splitting.									66	4	0	0	2	0	66				2198-3844		WOS:000510787500001	32195077

XRD patterns reveal the formation of a single fergusonite phase, and the dependence of microwave dielectric properties on its structural characteristic was investigated based on Rietveld refinements together with complex chemical bond theory. The variation of dielectric constant is attributed to the Nb/Al1/3W2/3-O bond ionicity. The grain size and total lattice energy are both associated with quality factor, and the temperature coefficient is affected by oxygen and bond valence of the Nb site. Infrared reflectivity spectrum analysis illustrated that the permittivity is primarily due to ion polarization in the microwave frequency region. Notably, the following properties of NdNb1-x(Al1/3W2/3)(x)O-4 (x = 0.04) ceramics were obtained: epsilon(r) approximate to 19.04, Q x f approximate to 58219 GHz and (f) approximate to -41.14 ppm/degrees C.									35	3	0	0	0	0	35			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000450208000022	30357218

Modeling a microwave chemical vapor deposition reactor requires accurate determination of the electron energy distribution generated by the microwave electromagnetic fields and their interaction with the neutral gas because the distribution is highly nonthermal and the important dissociation and ionization rates are determined by the small fraction of high energy electrons. The electrons lose most of their energy to vibrational excitation of the gas which heats it through vibrational-translational energy exchange. The one-point model takes account in an approximate way of the effects of mass diffusion and thermal conduction to the reactor substrate and walls. We show time dependent calculations of the rise in gas temperature, the evolution of ion species, and the neutral species development in the pressure range of 40-110 Torr characteristic of conditions in an ASTeX reactor. We vary the input power and the input methane and oxygen fractions and compare with experimental measurements in the reactor.					40th National Symposium of the American-Vacuum-Society40th National Symposium of the American-Vacuum-Society	NOV 15-19, 1993NOV 15-19, 1993	AMER VACUUM SOCAMER VACUUM SOC	ORLANDO, FLORLANDO, FL	20	1	0	0	0	0	20			0734-2101			WOS:A1994NZ03000096

SMALL METHODS				3	6	SI				1800291	10.1002/smtd.201800291				JUN 12 2019	2019	Converting N-2 to NH3 is an extremely valuable process but a long-standing challenge in chemistry. The crux is the choice of catalysts, where single atomic catalysts (SAC) are always pursued as the altar of atomic catalysts. In this paper, double atomic catalysts (DAC) of TM2-C2N with SAC of TM-C2N (TM = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) are systematically compared. Unexpectedly, TM2-C2N are more suitable than TM-C2N as catalysts for NRR. Moreover, the Mn-2-C2N endows the highest catalytic activity with the lowest potential of -0.23 V versus RHE, which is the best among all reported calculation results for NRR under ambient conditions. As a result, a new way to design catalysts with DAC is provided.									150	12	0	0	2	0	151			2366-9608			WOS:000476756200002

However, in 1951 it was shown that two enzymes were needed and that glutathione was the required catalytic co-factor. The concept of a metabolic pathway defined by two enzymes emerged at this time. Its association to detoxification and anti-glycation defence are its presently accepted roles, since methylglyoxal exerts irreversible effects on protein structure and function, associated with misfolding. This functional defence role has been the rationale behind the possible use of the glyoxalase pathway as a therapeutic target, since its inhibition might lead to an increased methylglyoxal concentration and cellular damage. However, metabolic pathway analysis showed that glyoxalase effects on methylglyoxal concentration are likely to be negligible and several organisms, from mammals to yeast and protozoan parasites, show no phenotype in the absence of one or both glyoxalase enzymes. The aim of the present review is to show the evolution of thought regarding the glyoxalase pathway since its discovery 100 years ago, the current knowledge on the glyoxalase enzymes and their recognized role in the control of glycation processes.									171	2	1	0	140	0	176			0264-6021	1470-8728		WOS:000320908400001	23763312

Their synthesis into electronic materials and operation in chemical looping technologies are based on reduction and oxidation reactions that involve exchanges of ions and electrons. These processes result in the creation and diffusion of defects that determine the nanoscale crystal phases and morphologies within these materials and their subsequent bulk chemical and electrical behavior. In this study, samples of metal oxide composites undergoing cycles of reduction and oxidation are examined at the nano- and micro-scale; the interfacial characteristics of dissimilar metals and metal oxides within the composites are examined. Specifically, structural transformations during redox processes involving pure Fe, FeNi alloy, and CuNi alloy microparticles are investigated. In Fe and FeNi systems, nanowires and nanopores are observed to simultaneously form on the microparticle surface during oxidation, while no such structuring is observed in the CuNi system. Additionally, uniform FeNi microparticles are transformed into particles with a NiO-rich core and a Fe2O3-rich shell during oxidation, due to differences in the oxidation and ion diffusion rates of Ni and Fe. In all material systems, the oxidized form of the microparticles exhibited porous cores due to ion transport described by the Kirkendall effect. A fundamental understanding of these phenomena will help direct the fabrication of electronic oxide materials and the development of metal oxide-based oxygen carriers for chemical looping applications.									46	1	0	0	3	0	56			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000342763300038

Various A. fumigatus strains were used and the oxidative response was analysed by flow cytometry. A significant difference was observed between live and killed-conidia. A pigmentless strain gave an important intracellular oxidative response compared with pigmented strains. But no difference was observed between strains isolated from patients with invasive aspergillosis (IA) and bronchial colonisation. The modification of healthy phagocytes' oxidative response caused by A. fumigatus components is not sufficient to explain the virulence of fungus and to predict an evolution of patients with IA.									8	0	0	0	8	0	9			0933-7407	1439-0507		WOS:000235778400001	16466437

However, the nickel-rich layered cathode material exhibits insufficient high-voltage cycling stability ascribing to the phase transformation, surface side reactions, and lattice oxygen evolution. This work developed an effective inorganic coating strategy to construct LiNiO2/Na1-xNi1-yPO4 surface hybrid coating layer and Na bulk doping simultaneously by a simple wet-chemical method, improving the high-voltage performance of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM) effectively. It is found that the surface oxygen vacancy and surface residual lithium on NCM reacts with NaNiPO4 precursors at 500 degrees C to form LiNiO2 inner layer in addition to the Na1-xNi1-yPO4 outer layer, which is structurally coherent to the layered lattice of NCM. In the constructed hybrid layer, layered phase LiNiO2 firmly fixes on the NCM surface. At the same time, highly chemical stable Na1-xNi1-yPO4 with lattice tunnels can enable lithium-ion transport and act as a protecting layer to inhibit surface side reactions. In addition, Na bulk doping could enlarge lithium-ion diffusion channels and stabilize lattice structure. All these advantages contribute to improving the electrochemical performance of NCM. The results show that the surface treatment NCM cathode exhibit excellent cycling stability with a higher capacity retention of 88 % after 200 cycles under 25 degrees C and 86 % after 100 cycles under 55 degrees C, both at 1C. This method provides a feasible strategy to promote the high-voltage cycling performance of electrode material, thus improving the service life, energy density, and safety performance of Li-ion batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000861059400003

The microhardness data of the coatings were also statistically analyzed by using the Weibull distribution.

With increasing test temperature, the coatings showed an increase in wear rate.

Corrosion Behavior of Annealed Steels with Different Carbon Contents (0.002, 0.17, 0.43 and 0.7% C) in Freely Aerated 3.5% NaCl Solution								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				28	7	SI		4041	4052		10.1007/s11665-019-04137-5				JUL 2019	2019	Four annealed carbon steels with different carbon contents (0.002, 0.17, 0.43, and 0.7% C), consisting of ferrite, ferrite-pearlite and fully pearlite microstructures, were selected to understand the corrosion behavior of carbon steel as a function of carbon content in freely aerated 3.5% NaCl solution. Dynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance and linear polarization methods were used. The corrosion rate obtained from the different carbon steels was found to increase greatly from ultra-low carbon steel (0.002%) to low carbon steel (0.17%) due to the presence of pearlite in the low carbon steel. However, the increase in corrosion rate was marginal with the increase in carbon content from low carbon (0.17%) to medium (0.43% C) and high carbon steels (0.7% C). The mirostrucural evolution of the steels before and after polarization test without etching as observed by scanning electron microscopy could show that the corrosion behavior of the steels with the presence of pearlite was due to the combined effect from % pearlite, interlamellar spacing and cementite/ ferrite area ratio in pearlite. Pearlite morphology also led to the differential corrosion within the pearlite colony in all the steels except the steel with 0.002% C. Catalytic activity of cementite on enhancing oxygen reduction reaction attributes to the higher corrosion rates in case of the steels with the presence of pearlite.									22	1	0	0	0	0	22			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000488773700028

Herein, ZnSe/C composites with Zn-O-C bonds and 3D hierarchical structure were successfully prepared. Precisely, ZnSe nanoparticles are tightly riveted in the 3D carbon matrix crosslinking by Zn-O-C bonds. The 3D carbon network improves structure stability by restricting volume expansion. More importantly, experimental results along with DFT calculations reveal that Zn-O-C bonds served as electron/charge bridge accelerate charge/ion transfer, indicating fast reaction kinetics. Electrochemically, ZnSe/C composites show an ultra-long lifetime of 1000 cycles at 5 A g(-1) with a capacity of 281 mA h g(-1). Furthermore, the electrochemical mechanism of conversion and alloy reactions is revealed by monitoring the phase evolutions and internal impedance changes during the charge-discharge process. Remarkably, the superior cycling life arising from 3D carbon matrix and Zn-O-C bonds demonstrates ZnSe/C composites as reversible and promising anode materials for SIBs. Valence bond bridging such as metal-O-C bonds will have broad prospects for enhancing structural stability and electrochemical properties.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000746583100001

Highly efficient and robust electrocatalysts for the ethanol oxidation reaction are therefore desired. In this paper, we report a facile approach for synthesizing monodisperse PdSn/SnOx core/shell nanoparticles as high-performance catalysts for electrochemical ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). The mass current density of PdSn/SnOx reached 3.2 A mg(Pd)(-1) at 0.85 V vs. RHE in 1 M KOH solution, which is 3.2 times higher than that of the commercial Pd catalyst. More importantly, these PdSn/SnOx core/shell nanoparticles exhibit enhanced stability compared with the commercial Pd catalyst. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the strong d-p orbital coupling and sp-electron transfer in the PdSn alloy weaken the adsorption of carbonaceous species, e.g., the acetate-evolution intermediate *CH3CO and the poisoning species *CO, at Pd sites. Consequently, the destabilization of these species facilitates their coupling with *OH, leading to enhanced EOR activity and poison resistance. Meanwhile, we found that amorphous SnOx layers possess rich Sn-Sn ensembles with stronger adsorption of *OH, providing a shuttling path of hydroxide ions to surface sites.									21	0	0	0	3	0	21			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000581598800008

Perovskite oxides have been considered promising redox catalysts for two-step thermochemical H2O splitting cycles due to their remarkable oxygen exchange capacity at low thermal heating temperatures. This study is the first to investigate perovskite series of La1-x Ca (x) CoO3 for two-step thermochemical H2O splitting cycles. The Ca doping contents in La1-x Ca (x) CoO3 perovskites showed a significant effect on the O-2 and H-2 production performances. Increasing the Ca doping content has greatly increased O-2 evolution during the thermal reduction process. However, high Ca dopant content significantly weakened the reaction thermodynamics of the subsequent H2O splitting and led to lower re-oxidation yields. After tuning the Ca doping level from 0.2 to 0.8, La0.6Ca0.4CoO3 was identified as the best trade-off among the tested La1-x Ca (x) CoO3 perovskites. The thermal reduction and water splitting temperatures were also systematically investigated to optimize the thermochemical operational conditions. La0.6Ca0.4CoO3 showed maximum H-2 production of 587 A mu mol g(-1) when the two-step thermochemical H2O splitting carried out between 1300 and 900 A degrees C, eighteen times higher than that of CeO2 under the same experimental condition. More importantly, La0.6Ca0.4CoO3 also exhibited fairly good catalytic stability during the thermochemical cycling test and has strong potential for long-term applications.									18	1	0	0	1	0	19			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000424874900043		
J	Talon, S; Zahn, JP; Maeder, A; Meynet, G								Rotational mixing in early-type stars: The main-sequence evolution of a 9 M-circle dot star								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				322	1			209	217						JUN 1997	1997	We describe the main-sequence evolution of a rotating 9 M. star. Its interior rotation profile is determined by the redistribution of angular momentum through the meridian circulation and through the shear turbulence generated by the differential rotation; the possible effect of internal waves is neglected. We examine the mixing of chemicals produced by the same internal motions. Our modelization is based on the set of equations established by Zahn (1992) and completed in Matias, Talon & Zahn (1996). Our calculations show that the amount of mixing associated with a typical rotation velocity of similar to 100 km s(-1) yields stellar models whose global parameters are very similar to those obtained with the moderate overshooting (d/Hp similar or equal to 0.2) which has been invoked until now to fit the observations. Fast rotation (similar to 300 km s(-1)) leads to significant changes of the C/N and O/N surface ratios, but the abundance of He is barely increased. The modifications of the internal composition profile due to such rotational mixing will certainly affect the post-main-sequence evolution.									165	0	1	0	0	1	166			0004-6361			WOS:A1997XD11800029

Since in the interior of such a massive white dwarf nuclear burning progresses on microscopic scales as a sharp discontinuity, a so-called flamelet, which cannot be resolved by any numerical scheme, and since on macroscopic scales the burning front propagates due to turbulence, we make an attempt to model both effects explicitly in the framework of a finite-volume hydrodynamics code. Turbulence is included by a sub-grid model, following the spirit of large eddy simulations, and the well-localized burning front is treated by means of a level set, which allows us to compute the geometrical structure of the front more accurately than with previous methods. The only free parameters of our simulations are the location and the amount of nuclear fuel that is ignited as an initial perturbation. We find that models in which explosive carbon burning is ignited at the center remain bound by the time the front reaches low densities, where we stopped the computations because our description of combustion is no longer applicable. In contrast, off-center ignition models give rise to explosions which, however, are still too weak for typical Type Ia supernovae. Possible reasons for this rather disappointing result are discussed.									78	2	1	0	0	0	80			1432-0746			WOS:000081620700040

However, understanding the metal/oxide interface and their evolution under reaction conditions remains challenging. Herein, we investigate the interface between Au nanoparticles and a CeO2 substrate by environmental transmission electron microscopy with atomic resolution. We find that the Au nanoparticles have two preferential epitaxial relationships with the substrate, i.e. Type I (111)[-110]CeO2//(111)[-110]Au and Type II (111)[-110]CeO2//(111)[1-10]Au orientation relationships, where Type I is preferred. In situ observations in the presence of O-2 show that the gas can stimulate the supported Au nanoparticles to transform between these two orientations even at room temperature. Moreover, when increasing the temperature to 973 K, the transformation of an Au nanoparticle between the two orientation states and a non-crystalline state in the presence of O-2 is also observed. DFT calculations of the binding between Au and CeO2 in the two relationships are strongly influenced by the presence of oxygen vacancies. For a given position of a vacancy, there is a significant energy difference between the energy of the two types. However, for some positions, Type I is preferred, and for others, Type II, but the most favourable position of the vacancy for the two types has a very similar energy. This is consistent with the observation of both types of adhesion.									8	1	0	0	0	0	9			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000472559800049	31184684

Photosynthesis relies on these modified tetrapyrroles for the capture of solar radiation and its conversion to chemical energy. (Bacterio) chlorophylls have an isocyclic fifth ring, the formation of which has remained enigmatic for more than 60 y. This reaction is catalyzed by two unrelated cyclase enzymes using different chemistries. The majority of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria use BchE, an O-2-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster protein, whereas plants, cyanobacteria, and some phototrophic bacteria possess an O-2-dependent enzyme, the major catalytic component of which is a diiron protein, AcsF. Plant and cyanobacterial mutants in ycf54 display impaired function of the O-2-dependent enzyme, accumulating the reaction substrate. Swapping cyclases between cyanobacteria and purple phototrophic bacteria reveals three classes of the O-2-dependent enzyme. AcsF from the purple betaproteobacterium Rubrivivax (Rvi.) gelatinosus rescues the loss not only of its cyanobacterial ortholog, cycI, in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, but also of ycf54; conversely, coexpression of cyanobacterial cycI and ycf54 is required to complement the loss of acsF in Rvi. gelatinosus. These results indicate that Ycf54 is a cyclase subunit in oxygenic phototrophs, and that different classes of the enzyme exist based on their requirement for an additional subunit. AcsF is the cyclase in Rvi. gelatinosus, whereas alphaproteobacterial cyclases require a newly discovered protein that we term BciE, encoded by a gene conserved in these organisms. These data delineate three classes of O-2-dependent cyclase in chlorophototrophic organisms from higher plants to bacteria, and their evolution is discussed herein.									24	0	0	0	21	0	24			0027-8424	1091-6490		WOS:000403179300048	28559347

AGING CELL				9	4			519	526		10.1111/j.1474-9726.2010.00578.x				AUG 2010	2010	P>Species differences in life span have been attributed to cellular survival during various stressors, designated here as 'cell resilience'. In primary fibroblast cultures, cell resilience during exposure to free radicals, hypoglycemia, hyperthermia, and various toxins has shown generally consistent correlations with the species characteristic life spans of birds and mammals. However, the mechanistic links of cell resilience in fibroblast cultures to different species life spans are poorly understood. We propose that certain experimental stressors are relevant to somatic damage in vivo during inflammatory responses of innate immunity, particularly, resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS), low glucose, and hyperthermia. According to this hypothesis, somatic cell resilience determines species differences in longevity during repeated infections and traumatic injuries in the natural environment. Infections and injury expose local fibroblasts and other cells to ROS generated by macrophages and to local temperature elevations. Systemically, acute phase immune reactions cause hypoglycemia and hyperthermia. We propose that cell resilience to somatic stressors incurred in inflammation is important in the evolution of longevity and that longer-lived species are specifically more resistant to immune-related stressors. This hypothesis further specifies Kirkwood's disposable soma theory. We suggest expanding the battery of stressors and markers used for comparative studies to additional cell types and additional parameters relevant to host defense and to their ecological specificities.									20	0	0	0	16	0	20			1474-9718	1474-9726		WOS:000280195100007	20415721

Herein, an effective ORR catalyst based on Fe nanoparticles encapsulated by S,N-codoped few-layer defective carbon (Fe@S,N-DC) was synthesized via a microwave-assisted strategy. The obtained Fe@S,N-DC nanocomposite showed a remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward ORR in acidic media, with a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of +0.785 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which was 80 mV more positive than that of the sulfur-free counterpart (Fe@N-DC). Furthermore, due to the protection by the S,N-codoped carbon shell, the FegS,N-DC nanocomposite displayed apparent stability with only a 13 mV negative shift of E(1/2)( )after 10,000 cycles and excellent tolerance to methanol. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy measurements confirmed the formation of multiple defective sites on the S,N-codoped carbon surface and strong interfacial electron transfer from the Fe core to the outer carbon surface, as compared to the sulfur-free counterpart. The enriched electron density on the defective carbon surface of FegS,N-DC, induced by the interfacial electron transfer, facilitated the reduction of O-2 to OOH*, leading to enhanced ORR performance. These results shed light on the significance of S doping in Fe-N-C catalysts in the design of high-performance NPM catalysts for ORR in acidic media.									27	4	0	0	1	0	28			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000526543400031	32102541

In this review, first, the fundamentals of phosphorus allotropes, phosphorene, and black phosphorus, are briefly introduced, along with their structures, properties, and synthesis methods. Second, the readers are presented with an overview of their energy applications. Particularly in electrochemical energy storage, the large interlayer spacing (0.53 nm) in phosphorene allows the intercalation/deintercalation of larger ions as compared to its graphene counterpart. Therefore, phosphorene may possess greater potential for high electrochemical performance. In addition, the status of lithium ion batteries as well as secondary sodium ion batteries is reviewed. Next, each application for energy generation, conversion, and storage is described in detail with milestones as well as the challenges. These emerging applications include supercapacitors, photovoltaic devices, water splitting, photocatalytic hydrogenation, oxygen evolution, and thermoelectric generators. Finally the fast-growing dynamic field of phosphorene research is summarized and perspectives on future possibilities are presented calling on the efforts of chemists, physicists, and material scientists									275	23	1	0	11	0	278			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000427968900015

Herein, a novel P2/O3 intergrown Li-containing Na0.8Li0.27Mn0.68Ti0.05O2 cathode material prepared by Ti-substitution into Mn-site is reported. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of the biphasic composite structure and inactive d(0) element substitution, this P2/O3 electrode exhibits high initial charge/discharge capacity and excellent cycling performance. The combination of different characterization techniques including solid-state NMR, electron paramagnetic resonance, X-ray adsorption spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy gives insights into the local electronic environment, the redox chemistry, and also the microstructure rigidity of these cathode materials upon cycling. On the basis of comprehensive comparison with the Ti-free P2/O3-Na0.8Li0.27Mn0.73O2, the observed improvement on the electrochemical performance is primarily attributed to the mitigation of notorious Mn3+/Mn4+ redox and the enhanced stability of the oxygen charge compensation behavior. From the viewpoint of structure evolution, Ti-substitution restrains the Li+ loss and irreversible structural degradation during cycling. This study provides an in-depth understanding of the electronic and crystal structure evolutions after inactive d(0) element substitution and may shed light on the rational design of high-performance P2/O3 biphasic Mn-based layered cathodes.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000572965700053	32833421

The performance of the cell operating on 2-propanol is substantially higher than when it was operating on methanol at current densities lower than similar to200 mA/cm(2). The electrical efficiency of the direct 2-propanol fuel cell is nearly 1.5 times that of the direct methanol fuel cell at power densities below 128 mW/cm(2). Studies on the effects of electrocatalyst loading, of 2-propanol concentration, and of oxygen pressure on cell performance indicate that the cells operating on 2-propanol require lower anode and cathode loadings than cells operating on methanol. Cathode poisoning by 2-propanol is less severe than by methanol. Hydrogen gas evolution observed at the anode at low current densities indicated that catalytic dehydrogenation of 2-propanol occurred over the anode catalyst. A rapid voltage drop occurred at high current densities and after operating the cell for extended periods of time at constant current. The rapid voltage drop is an anode phenomenon.

Palladium and platinum overlayers here denote either the Pd and Pt mono- and bilayers deposited over (111) crystallographic plane of Pd, Pt, Cu, and Au monocrystals or the (111) crystallographic plane of Pd and Pt monocrystals with inserted one-atom-thick surface underlayer of Pd, Pt, Cu, and Au. The attention was focused on the bond lengths, hydrogen adsorption energetics, mobility of adsorbed hydrogen, and surface reactivity toward hydrogen electrode reactions. Both the ligand and strain effects were considered, found to lead to a significant modification of the electronic structure of Pd and Pt overlayers, described through the position of the d-band center, and tuning of the hydrogen adsorption energy in the range that covers approximately 120 kJmol-1. Mobility of hydrogen adsorbed on studied overlayers was found to be determined by hydrogen-metal binding energy. Obtained results regarding Pd layers on Pt(111) and Au(111) surfaces, in conjunction with some of the recent experimental data, were used to explain its electrocatalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction.									45	0	0	0	1	0	45			1687-7985			INSPEC:12642043

This technique can apply equally effectively to bare as well as modified BiVO4 by Mo-doping, heterojunction formation with WO3, and an oxygen evolution co-catalyst. Relative to FA, HMA forms BiVO4 films of smaller feature sizes, higher porosity, and increased three dimensional roughness, which decrease the diffusion distance of holes to the surface and thereby increase mainly the bulk charge separation efficiency (eta(bulk)) of the photoanodes. Thus, the HMA-treated BiVO4/WO3 film achieves the state-of-the art eta(bulk) of similar to 90% for water oxidation. Combination of a photoanode of NiOOH/FeOOH/BiVO4/WO3 (HMA, 6 min) with a 2p c-Si solar cell allows a solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency of similar to 5.0% in unbiased overall water splitting, which is also comparable to the state-of-the-art for a similar material combination.									31	0	0	0	2	0	31			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000386244400029	27714102

The analysis covers two data sets obtained in separate experimental campaigns. The first data set was obtained in a previous work (Mouton et al., 2013) in methane/oxygen/nitrogen flames (equivalence ratio range 1.95 < Phi < 2.32) at 26.7 kPa, whereas the second was performed in atmospheric ethylene/air flames (1.77 < Phi < 2.00). Both studies show similar trends, i.e. a gradual change of the fluence curves (evolution of the LII signal as function of the laser fluence) from the well-known S-shaped curve for mature soot found at high heights above the burner (HAB) and high equivalence ratio, to a nearly linear behavior for nascent soot found at low HAB and reduced equivalence ratio. With this change comes a decrease in the LII decay time (and hence inferred particle size). Also, this decay time appears to be almost constant with HAB in flames having the lowest equivalence ratio at which the incandescence signal could be detected. In these flames, so-called nucleation flames, the stability of the particle size with HAB suggests that recently nucleated particles have undergone marginal surface growth and coagulation. Existence of such nucleation flames is of great interest for improving the theoretical description of the nucleation step. Experimental results are analyzed by using a theoretical model for LII to determine the particle size evolution throughout the flame at various experimental conditions. We highlight the size difference from nascent soot particles up to mature soot, giving insight into the particle nucleation and the surface growth processes as a function of reaction time and flame conditions.

Temperature dependences of the yield of liquid and volatile products and kinetic parameters of the process have been obtained. The yields of oil, resin, asphaltene and volatile products in relation to the coal organic matter (COM) are 23.2, 16.1, 5.1 and 14.1%, respectively. CO2, CO, H2S and C-1-C-4 alkanes prevail in the composition of volatile products. The generation of oil, resin and asphaltene are found to have occurred in terms of the simultaneous chemical reactions of cleavage of the COM aliphatic C-C bonds, while the volatile products result from the consecutive transformations of the COM components in the bulk and SCW solution. Participation of H2O molecules in thermochemical transformations of COM leads to increase in the oxygen amount in the conversion products and residue by 13.2%. Hydrogen and heat evolution during zinc oxidation by SCW provides for the hydrogenation of COM in situ. Addition of zinc to coal results in increase in the volatile products yield up to 48.6% and decrease in the conversion residue yield up to 20.8%. Under these conditions the yield of resin does not change, while the yields of oil and asphaltene decrease up to 21.2 and 2.5%, respectively. Based on the sulfur balance it is revealed that approximate to 40% of sulfur atoms pass into ZnS owing to the reactions of H2S with Zn and ZnO resulting in the removal of H2S from the volatile conversion products.

Reactions between these new surface structures and/or reactive oxygen species in the electrolyte can lead to the formation of a cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the surface of the electrode, though the link between CEI composition and the performance of Li-excess materials is not well understood. To bridge this gap in understanding, we use solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) spectroscopy, dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) NMR, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to assess the chemical composition and impedance of the CEI on Li(2)RuO(3)as a function of state of charge and cycle number. We show that the CEI that forms on Li(2)RuO(3)when cycled in carbonate-containing electrolytes is similar to the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that has been observed on anode materials, containing components such as PEO, Li acetate, carbonates, and LiF. The CEI composition deposited on the cathode surface on charge is chemically distinct from that observed upon discharge, supporting the notion of crosstalk between the SEI and the CEI, with Li+-coordinating species leaving the CEI during delithiation. Migration of the outer CEI combined with the accumulation of poor ionic conducting components on the static inner CEI may contribute to the loss of performance over time in Li-excess cathode materials.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2296-2646			WOS:000563493400001	32850679

PCC6803 (S. 6803). Treatment of S. 6803 with 200 mu M acrolein for 3 d significantly and irreversibly inhibited its growth. To elucidate the inhibitory mechanism, we examined the effects of acrolein on photosynthesis. In contrast to dark conditions, the addition of acrolein to S. 6803 under conditions of illumination lowered the CO2-dependent O-2 evolution rate (photosynthetic activity). Furthermore, treatment with acrolein lowered the activity reducing dimethyl benzoquinone in photosystem II (PSII). Acrolein also suppressed the reduction rate for the oxidized form of the reaction center chlorophyll of photosystem I (PSI), P700. These results indicate that acrolein inhibited PSII activity in thylakoid membranes. The addition of 200 mu M acrolein to the illuminated S. 6803 cells gradually increased the steady-state level (Fs) of Chl fluorescence and decreased the quantum yield of PSII. These results suggested that acrolein damaged the acceptor side of PSII. On the other hand, acrolein did not inhibit respiration. From the above results, we gained insight into the metabolism of acrolein and its physiological effects in S. 6803.									14	0	0	0	13	0	14			0916-8451	1347-6947		WOS:000323868600009	23924728

K-feldspar rims and veinlets, which accompany garnet and amphibole coronitic textures in the orthorocks, are the mineralogic indicators of rock interaction with fluids containing potassium and sodium salts. The calcium content of garnet in the rocks systematically increases from the earliest generation of the mineral to the latest, which coexist with newly formed K-feldspar. According to the reactionCaAl2Si2O8 + 3SiO(2) + {4/3K(+) + 2/3H(2)O} = 4/3KAlSi(3)O(8) + 1/3Ca(3)Al(2)Si(3)O(12) + 4/3H(+)An Qtz fluid Kfs Grsfluid an increase in the calcium content of the garnet corresponds to an increase in the alkali activity in the fluid (at constant rand P) during corona growth. Calculation of temperature, pressure, oxygen, and alkali activities showed that the formation of garnet-K-feldspar-quartz coronas in metamangerites and metaanorthosites from the Adirondack Complex has taken place at T= 700-600 degrees C, P = 7-6 kbar under conditions of low oxygen and carbon dioxide activities and has resulted from the isobaric cooling of the rocks from metamorphic peak at high potassium and sodium activities in aqueous-chloride reduced fluid. The determining factor in the formation of fr which was caused by the high concentration of the Crt + Kfs + Qtz assemblage of the rocks was low a(H2O)(fl) potassium and sodium salts (up to X-salts =0.7) in the fluid. Two consequent stages were distinguished in the evolution of fluid in the Adirondack Complex: (I) high-temperature (700-600 degrees C) stage of rock interaction with aqueous fluid saturated with potassium and sodium chlorides and (2) low-temperature (<600 degrees C) stage of rock alteration by aqueous-carbon dioxide fluids.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0869-5911			WOS:000078723500007

Our computed results reveal that the monolayer and few-layered GeP3 systems can exhibit the good HER activity, where both the top sites over Ge and P atoms can serve as the most active sites. The correlative catalytic mechanisms are analyzed in detail. Further, we propose the effective strategy through applying the external strain to enhance the HER activity of these 2D layered GeP3 systems by optimizing the adsorption state of H* (Delta G(H*)) or electronic property. Imposing the compressive strain on the monolayer GeP3 and the tensile strain on the few-layered GeP3 can simultaneously endow them with the optimum Delta G(H*) value and good conductivity, bringing higher HER activity. Moreover, we have also constructed series of new sandwich nanostructures by alternately stacking the monolayer GeP3 and graphene, and all of them can uniformly exhibit the outstanding HER activity, due to the optimum Delta G(H*) value and good conductivity. Obviously, all these fascinating findings can be advantageous for achieving the highly efficient and nonprecious HER electrocatalysts based on the excellent GeP3 nanomaterials in the near future.									17	2	0	0	0	0	17			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000472176900034		
J	Seidel, Daniel				Seidel, Daniel/G-3291-2018	Seidel, Daniel/0000-0001-6725-111X			The Azomethine Ylide Route to Amine C-H Functionalization: Redox-Versions of Classic Reactions and a Pathway to New Transformations								ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH				48	2			317	328		10.1021/ar5003768				FEB 2015	2015	Redox-neutral methods for the functionalization of amine alpha-CH bonds are inherently efficient because they avoid external oxidants and reductants and often do not generate unwanted byproducts. However, most of the current methods for amine alpha-CH bond functionalization are oxidative in nature. While the most efficient variants utilize atmospheric oxygen as the terminal oxidant, many such transformations require the use of expensive or toxic oxidants, often coupled with the need for transition metal catalysts.Redox-neutral amine alpha-functionalizations that involve intramolecular hydride transfer steps provide viable alternatives to certain oxidative reactions. These processes have been known for some time and are particularly well suited for tertiary amine substrates. A mechanistically distinct strategy for secondary amines has emerged only recently, despite sharing common features with a range of classic organic transformations. Among those are such widely used reactions as the Strecker, Mannich, PictetSpengler, and KabachnikFields reactions, FriedelCrafts alkylations, and iminium alkynylations. In these classic processes, condensation of a secondary amine with an aldehyde (or a ketone) typically leads to the formation of an intermediate iminium ion, which is subsequently attacked by a nucleophile. The corresponding redox-versions of these transformations utilize identical starting materials but incorporate an isomerization step that enables alpha-CH bond functionalization. Intramolecular versions of these reactions include redox-neutral amine alpha-amination, alpha-oxygenation, and alpha-sulfenylation. In all cases, a reductive N-alkylation is effectively combined with an oxidative alpha-functionalization, generating water as the only byproduct.Reactions are promoted by simple carboxylic acids and in some cases require no additives. Azomethine ylides, dipolar species whose usage is predominantly in [3 + 2] cycloadditions and other pericyclic processes, have been identified as common intermediates. Extension of this chemistry to amine a,beta-difunctionalization has been shown to be possible by way of converting the intermediate azomethine ylides into transient enamines.This Account details the evolution of this general strategy and the progress made to date. Further included is a discussion of related decarboxylative reactions and transformations that result in the redox-neutral aromatization of (partially) saturated cyclic amines. These processes also involve azomethine ylides, reactive intermediates that appear to be far more prevalent in condensation chemistry of amines and carbonyl compounds than previously considered. In contrast, as exemplified by some redox transformations that have been studied in greater detail, iminium ions are not necessarily involved in all amine/aldehyde condensation reactions.									184	2	0	0	64	0	183			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000349806300019	25560649

However, the low energy efficiency and poor cycle-life impede the further development of rechargeable ZABs. It is desirable to improve the performance of ZABs by developing highly efficient, long-life time bifunctional air electrodes. We propose a Janus-typed integrated bifunctional air electrode, which consists of MnOx and NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) by means of electrodeposition on Ni foam. The Janus-typed integrated bifunctional air electrode can avoid positive oxidation of MnOx owing to the spatial separation of the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER). Moreover, based on the unique structure, the resulting air electrode exhibits better catalytic activity due to the combination of the unique advantages of MnOx and FeNi LDH, and the enhancement of active species transportation. This Janus-typed air electrode for rechargeable ZAB achieved an energy efficiency of 65.7% at 10 mA cm(-2), excellent stability over 110 h, and peak power density of 120 mW cm(-2). The Janus structure for the bifunctional electrode provides a valuable approach to develop high-performance rechargeable ZABs.

The evolution of microstructure, phase transition and energy storage properties were investigated to evaluate the potential as high energy storage capacitors. Relaxor ferroelectric Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 was introduced to stabilize the antiferroelectric state through modulating the M-1-M-2 phase transition. Enhanced energy storage performance was achieved for the 3 mol% Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 doped AgNbO3 ceramic with high recoverable energy density of 3.4 J/cm(3) and energy efficiency of 62% under an applied field of 220 kV/cm. The improved energy storage performance can be attributed to the stabilized antiferroelectricity and decreased electrical hysteresis Delta E. In addition, the ceramics also displayed excellent thermal stability with low energy density variation (< 6%) over a wide temperature range of 20 - 80 degrees C. These results indicate that Mn-doped (1-x)AgNbO3-xBi(0.5)Na(0.5)TiO(3) ceramics are highly efficient lead-free antiferroelectric materials for potential application in high energy storage capacitors.									41	0	0	0	1	0	41			0955-2219	1873-619X		WOS:000494891400007

Galvanostatic copper deposition is one of the best methodologies to calibrate the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalances (EQCM), a gravimetric sensor to evaluate changes in mass during the electrochemical reactions through the Sauerbrey equation. The simultaneous measurement of mass, current density, and motional resistance by an EQCM with motional resistance monitoring allows us to characterize the processes occurring on the electrode surface and at the interfacial regions with unprecedented detail. During the galvanostatic copper deposition, Cu(H2O)(4)(OH)(2) is accumulated close to the copper surface, generating a passive layer. This passive layer can act as Cu2+ reservoir for the Cu2+ -> Cu process since the copper deposition is not affected. The analysis of motional resistance evolution in different experimental conditions reveals that the passive layer is formed by the reaction of oxidizing agents generated at the counter electrode with the metallic copper surface. The simplistic Cu2+ -> Cu process is completed with a more detailed mechanism, which includes the passive layer formation/dissolution and the transport of species from the counter electrode surface (Pt) to the working electrode surface. The results further support the calibration procedure of EQCM by the galvanostatic deposition of copper in sulfuric solutions. However, we suggest applying high current densities, separating the counter electrode and quartzlgold resonant electrode about 0.5 cm, and keeping oxygen in solution for the EQCM calibration. Moreover, the better interval time to calculate the Sauerbrey's constant from charge and resonant frequency data is between 150 and 300 s.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0743-7463			WOS:000365464200013	26549628

Using first-principles calculations, we investigated the SACs with single transition metal (TM) atom supported on defective boron carbide nitride nanotubes (BCNTs) as NRR electrocatalysts. Our results suggest that boron-vacancy defects on BCNTs can strongly immobilize TM atoms with large enough binding energy and high thermal/structural stability. Importantly, the synergistic effect of boron nitride (BN) and carbon domains comes up with the modifications of the charge polarization of single-TM-atom active site and the electronic properties of material, which has been proven to be the essential key to promote N-2 adsorption, activation, and reduction. Specifically, six SACs (namely V, Mn, Fe, Mo, Ru, and W atoms embedded into defective BCNTs) can be used as promising candidates for NRR electrocatalysts as their NRR activity is higher than the state-of-the art Ru(0001) catalyst. In particular, single Mo atom supported on defective BCNTs with large tube diameter possesses the highest NRR activity while suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, with a low limiting potential of -0.62 V via associative distal path. This work suggests new opportunities for driving NH3 production by carbon-based single-atom electrocatalysts under ambient conditions.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000630175300001	33565653

In this work, we have found and investigated the chain-like nucleation and growth of oxides on the aluminum nanoparticle (ANP) surface, using molecular dynamics simulations with the reactive force-field (ReaxFF). After nucleation, the chain-like oxide nuclei could stay on the ANP surface and continue growing into an oxide shell, extend outward from the surface to form longer oxide chains, or detach from the ANP to generate independent oxide clusters, which is highly dependent on the oxygen content, temperature, and nanoparticle size. Our results emphasize the complicated interplay between the surface structure of nanoparticles and the environmental conditions in determining the formation of oxides, which provides insights into the atomic-scale oxidation mechanism of metal nanoparticles.									44	5	0	0	0	0	46			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000462950500028	30785726

However, a robust, generic synthetic strategy toward atomically dispersed catalysts is still lacking, which has limited systematic studies revealing their general catalytic trends distinct from those of conventional nanoparticle (NP)-based catalysts. Herein, we report a general synthetic strategy toward atomically dispersed precious metal catalysts, which consists of "trapping" precious metal precursors on a heteroatom-doped carbonaceous layer coated on a carbon support and "immobilizing" them with a SiO2 layer during thermal activation. Through the "trapping-and-immobilizing" method, five atomically dispersed precious metal catalysts (Os, Ru, Rh, Ir, and Pt) could be obtained and served as model catalysts for unravelling catalytic trends for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Owing to their isolated geometry, the atomically dispersed precious metal catalysts generally showed higher selectivity for H2O2 production than their NP counterparts for the ORR. Among the atomically dispersed catalysts, the H2O2 selectivity was changed by the types of metals, with atomically dispersed Pt catalyst showing the highest selectivity. A combination of experimental results and density functional theory calculations revealed that the selectivity trend of atomically dispersed catalysts could be correlated to the binding energy difference between *OOH and *O species. In terms of 2 e(-) ORR activity, the atomically dispersed Rh catalyst showed the best activity. Our general approach to atomically dispersed precious metal catalysts may help in understanding their unique catalytic behaviors for the ORR.									60	4	0	0	7	0	62			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000518024700067	31999424	
J	Chae, Ki-Woong; Park, Ta-Ryeong; Cheon, Chae Il; Cho, Nam In; Kim, Jeong Seog								Luminescence enhancement by the reduction-oxidation synthesis in monoclinic RE2O3 (RE=Eu, Gd) phosphors containing Eu3+ activator								JOURNAL OF LUMINESCENCE				132	9			2293	2301		10.1016/j.jlumin.2012.03.041				SEP 2012	2012	A novel synthesis was developed for enhanced luminescence in sesquioxide phosphors containing Eu3+ activator. It consisted of two annealing steps: reduction under vacuum with gaseous H-2 at 10 Torr and 1300 degrees C and re-oxidation at 300-1500 degrees C in air. The integrated luminescence intensity of the monoclinic Eu2O3 phosphor was enhanced ca. 21 times by this method compared with conventional processing. The photoluminescence (PL) intensity was maximized at re-oxidation temperatures of 500-1100 degrees C. The PL characteristics of monoclinic Eu2O3 and Gd2O3:0.06Eu samples were compared with a commercial cubic Y2O3:Eu phosphor. The evolution of physical characteristics during the two-step annealing was studied by Raman spectroscopy, XPS, XRD, PL decay analysis, and SEM. PL decay lifetime increased proportionally to the PL intensity over the range 0.5-100 mu s. Additional vibrational modes appeared at 490, 497, and 512 cm(-1) after the two-step annealing. The increase in PL intensity was ascribed to the formation of excess oxygen vacancies and their redistribution during annealing. Resonance crossovers between the charge transfer state and the emitting D-5(J) states are discussed in relation to reported luminescence saturation mechanisms for oxysulfides Ln(2)O(2)S:Eu3+ (Ln=Y, La).

The TiO2 films were prepared by radio frequency (RF)-Magnetron Sputtering at different deposition time ranging from 1 up to 8 h and then characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-vis-NIR) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) measurements and by photocatalytic water splitting measurements in a two-compartment cell. The highest H-2 production rate was attained with the photoelectrode prepared by 6 h-long TiO2 deposition thanks to its high content in the rutile polymorph, which is active under visible light. By contrast, the photoactivity dropped for longer deposition time, because of the increased probability of electron-hole recombination due to the longer electron transfer path.									10	2	0	0	0	0	10				1996-1944		WOS:000375158900065

It has been established that at low anodic polarizations, second electron transfer step is rate determining, whereas at high anodic polarizations, such step is diffusion transport of lead ions to the electrode surface. The presence of sodium laureth sulfate in the deposition electrolyte leads to a slight inhibition of the deposition of lead dioxide. It has been found that the morphology and structure of composite materials differs significantly from lead dioxide. With an increase in the additive content in the composite, there is a transition from large-grained deposits to materials with submicron and nano-sized crystals. It is shown that anionic surfactants, sodium laureth sulfate in particular, are included in the growing lead dioxide. The content of organic substance in the oxide can vary from 3.2 to 12.5 wt.%, forming a surfactant-oxide composite coating. The electrocatalytic activity of the materials involved was investigated with respect to oxygen evolution reaction and the oxidation of 4-chlorophenol. The calculated value of Tafel slope is 229 on non-modified PbO2, while on 10.2 wt.% sodium laureth sulfate-PbO2, it is 178 mV/dec. According to absorption spectra, the initial solution of chlorophenol is characterized by two peaks at 220 and 280 nm. At first, the electrolysis shows a decrease in the peak at 220 nm, as well as a slight increase in the peak at 280 nm and the appearance of the plateau at 240-270 nm, which is caused by a decrease in the concentration of 4-chlorophenol and accumulation of benzoquinone in the solution. A further increase in the time of electrolysis leads to the disappearance of the peaks at 220 and 280 nm, as well as the reduction of the plateau at 240-270 nm due to a decrease in the concentrations of both 4-chlorophenol and benzoquinone. Already after 4 h of electrolysis, the aromatic compounds are completely destroyed with the formation of only aliphatic electrolysis products (mainly maleic acid), which was evidenced by high performance liquid chromatography. The processes of electrooxidation of 4-chlorophenol on lead dioxide and PbO2-based composite materials proceed qualitatively in the same way and differ only in the rate.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000527237500001

The degree of neutronization in SN Ia ejecta holds clues to this process because it depends on the mass and the metallicity of the stellar progenitor, and on the thermodynamic history prior to the explosion. We report on a new method to determine ejecta neutronization using Ca and S lines in the X-ray spectra of Type Ia supernova remnants (SNRs). Applying this method to Suzaku data of Tycho, Kepler, 3C 397, and G337.2-0.7 in the Milky Way, and N103B in the Large Magellanic Cloud, we find that the neutronization of the ejecta in N103B is comparable to that of Tycho and Kepler, which suggests that progenitor metallicity is not the only source of neutronization in SNe Ia. We then use a grid of SN Ia explosion models to infer the metallicities of the stellar progenitors of our SNRs. The implied metallicities of 3C 397, G337.2-0.7, and N103B are major outliers compared to the local stellar metallicity distribution functions, indicating that progenitor metallicity can be ruled out as the origin of neutronization for these SNRs. Although the relationship between ejecta neutronization and equivalent progenitor metallicity is subject to uncertainties stemming from the C-12 + O-16 reaction rate, which affects the Ca/S mass ratio, our main results are not sensitive to these details.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000404347000035

Barium oxidation was completed, and a binary silicate compound, Ba2SiO4, had formed within 24 h at 300 degrees C. After 72 h at 650 degrees C, aluminum oxidation was completed, and an appreciable amount of BaAl2O4 had formed. Diffraction peaks consistent with hexagonal BaAl2Si2O8, BaAl2O4, beta-BaSiO3, and possibly beta-BaSi2O5 were detected after 24 h at 900 degrees C, Diffraction peaks for BaAl2O4 and BaAl2Si2O8 were observed after 35 h at 1200 degrees C, although SEM analyses also revealed fine silicate particles, Further reaction of this silicate with BaAl2O4 at 1350 degrees to 1650 degrees C yielded a mixture of hexagonal and monoclinic BaAl2Si2O8.

Compared with Pt, the activity difference of Rh in alkaline and acidic media is much smaller. Meanwhile, Ni(OH)(2) is proved to be an effective catalyst for water dissociation. Therefore, Rh-Ni(OH)(2)/ C nanocomposites with different Rh:Ni(OH)(2) ratios were synthesized by a co-deposition/ partial reduction method, and their microstructures as well as electrocatalytic properties were studied. The results show that Rh and Ni(OH)(2) display synergistic effect in Rh-Ni(OH)(2)/C nanocomposites. The Rh-Ni(OH)(2)/C nanocomposite with a molar ratio of Rh to Ni(OH)(2) of 1:1 exhibits the highest activity. It shows an overpotential of 36 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) anda Tafel slope of 32 mV dec(-1) for HER in alkaline media, which is superior to commercial Pt/C. In addition, the Rh-Ni(OH)(2)/C (1:1) nanocomposite shows excellent durability in alkaline media as well. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Samples surface chemistry was studied using temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and H-2 temperature programmed reaction experiments. The porous texture was determined by CO2 and N-2 adsorption isotherms at 273 K and 77 K, respectively. SO2 adsorption experiments were performed at 313 K on fresh and heat treated (N-2 1173 K) samples using gas mixtures of 2000 ppm SO2 in N-2 or 2000 ppm SO2/5% O-2 in N-2 Adsorption experiments on heat treated samples show that the presence of surface oxygen complexes impedes the SO2 adsorption and its oxidation to SO3. Additionally, no correlation has been found between the: amount of SO2 adsorbed and the number of active sites created by the evolution of oxygen complexes during heat treatment. The results obtained have been explained using the fundamentals of gas adsorption for microporous solids. The SO2 uptake is analyzed considering the SO2 oxidation to SO3 as a new variable that is strongly affected by the pore size distribution. An optimum pore size exists (i.e. pore size of about 7 Angstrom) in which the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 is favoured. A pore width enlargement decreases the conversion of SO2 to SO3 and, thus, the total amount of SO2 retained by the carbon sample. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The thermo-oxidative degradation results in a decrease in the absorption of the electronic transition band, reduction in intensity and slight shift in position of most of the IR absorptions, the loss of the 870 cm(-1) absorption shoulder, and the formation of hydroxyl, nitrile and carbonyl species. In both air and nitrogen ageing environment, the evolution of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O) and ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) is detected. The dopant decomposes to form ferric oxide and to produce chlorine and/or hydrogen chloride, which in turn reacts with the pyrrole moiety in both air and nitrogen atmosphere. The source of oxygen for the thermal oxidation in nitrogen is the oxygen present in the polymer, probably as a dopant, O-2(-). Thermal degradation results in ring-opening reactions and the formation of oxidation species, which shorten the conjugation length leading to a rapid loss of conductivity. The loss of conductivity does not correspond exactly with the loss or formation of any individual species, but is best matched by the production of water and the decrease in the 870 cm(-1) shoulder. This indicates that the mechanisms of thermo-oxidative degradation are complex and the conductivity decay is likely to be caused by a number of different mechanisms.

Recent findings demonstrate that incorporation of trace Fe impurities from commonly used KOH electrolytes significantly improves oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity over NiOOH electrocatalysts. Because nearly all previous studies detailing structural differences between alpha-Ni(OH)(2)/gamma-NiOOH and beta-Ni(OH)(2)/beta-NiOOH were completed in unpurified electrolytes, it is unclear whether these structural changes are unique to the aging phase transition in the Ni-(oxy)hydroxide matrix or if they arise fully or in part from inadvertent Fe incorporation. Here, we report an investigation of the effects of Fe incorporation on structureactivity relationships in Ni-(oxy)hydroxide. Electrochemical, in situ Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance measurements were employed to investigate Ni(OH)(2) thin films aged in Fe-free and unpurified (reagent-grade) 1 M KOH (<1 ppm Fe). We find that Ni films aged in unpurified electrolyte can incorporate >= 20% Fe after 5 weeks of aging, and the maximum catalyst activity is comparable to that reported for optimized Ni1-xFexOOH catalysts. Conversely, Fe-free Ni(OH)(2) films exhibit a substantially lower activity and higher Tafel slope for the OER. Films aged in Fe-free electrolyte are predominantly disordered beta-Ni(OH)(2)/beta-NiOOH if maintained below 0.7 V vs Hg/HgO in 1 M KOH and will overcharge to form a mixture of gamma- and beta-NiOOH above this potential. Fe-containing Ni(OH)(2) films evidence a lesser extent of beta-Ni(OH)(2) formation and instead exhibit NiOOH structural changes in accordance with the formation of a Ni-Fe-layered double hydroxide phase. Furthermore, turnover frequency calculations indicate that Fe is the active site within this phase, and above similar to 11% Fe content, a separate, Fe-rich phase forms. These findings are the first to demonstrate the in situ changes in the catalyst structure resulting from the incorporation of Fe electrolyte impurities within Ni-(oxy)hydroxide, providing direct evidence that a NiFe layered double (oxy)hydroxide (LDH) phase is critical for high OER activity.									598	19	0	0	32	0	605			1932-7447			WOS:000352329500035

In conclusion, the composition of Ordovician formation water have been mainly con-trolled by evaporation and condensation of ancient seawater, undergone a series of dilution input and mix-ing of meteoric water in the early period of Hercynian, the Carboniferous formation water have been relat-ed to dilution and filtration as well as chemical interaction between the meteoric water and gypsum-bearing or halite rocks; while the Triassic formation water maybe derived from mixing and rock interaction with meteoric water.			塔河油区的不同地质时代的油田水成分差异较大、成因复杂。该文根据对塔河油区油田水的常规成分、微量元素和同位素特征统计分析，并将不同地质时代的油田水与原始海水平均含量、氯化钠蒸发阶段中海水的含量相比反映其相对的浓缩程度，同时与淡水平均含量及水岩反应在结果来推测淡水淋滤等水岩反应作用程度。研究表明，塔河奥陶系中的油田水中C1-/Br-为322～337，接近残余海水中卤素元素中溴富集的低限值，同时相对富集卤素元素或挥发份组分和铁族元素中的铬、钒，因而具有典型海相碳酸盐岩中的油田水特征；而石炭系中油田水中为C1-/Br-为1399.8，具有贫溴的溶滤水特征；三叠系碎屑岩中油田水中相对富集了亲铜元素和高含量锗。上述油田水中大多均具有变质水的delta~18O、deltaD值，三叠系油田水delta~18O负偏更明显，指示了后期可能受淡水改造；奥陶系油田水主要受原始海水控制，早期存在大气水淋滤－淋溶作用，石炭系油田水经过含膏层过滤反应及大气水的淋滤；而三叠系油田水则经大气淡水的淋滤－水岩等复杂的地质过程而形成。						1	12	0	0	0	0	13			1001-6112			CSCD:1241790

Digestion of thylakoid membranes and isolated Photosystem II preparations with trypsin, followed by immunoblotting using spinach anti-22 kDa antibodies, leads to two observations: (1) the domain between the 2nd and 3rd transmembrane helices of the 22 kDa protein is stromally exposed, and (2) only in a reaction center complex preparation, lacking the chlorophyll a/b-light harvesting complex II, is there extensive protoelytic cleavage of the 22 kDa protein. We also found that after, but not prior to, selective extraction of the 22 and 10 kDa proteins from Photosystem II membranes, the chlorophyll a/b-light harvesting complex II can be separated from the Photosystem II reaction center core by precipitation with MgCl2. This result suggests that the 22 kDa polypeptide is located between the Photosystem II reaction center polypeptides and light-harvesting complex II; it is possible that the protein serves as a link between the two protein complexes. The presence of the 22 kDa protein in several species was also examined by immunoblotting with polyclonal spinach anti-22 kDa antibodies.									27	1	0	0	24	0	27			0005-2728			WOS:A1994QG26500019	7803450

As formaldehyde, a liquid at room temperature, can release hydrogen upon oxidation at a Cu electrode, this system can serve as a H-2 portable source. This study employs home - made single crystal electrodes of Cu(111) and Cu100-xNix (111) (x = 1.5 and 4.3) to highlight the surprising boosting effect of the Ni dopant (similar to 1.5% molar ratio) in a Cu electrode toward FOR in 0.1 M KOH. These ordered electrodes are made by an annealing and quenching method performed in the ambient air (without the involvement of vacuum). Their FOR activities in KOH are scrutinized by voltammetry and chronoamperometry, from which the Cu98.5Ni1.5 (111) electrode is found to be 12 folds more active than the Cu(111) electrode. An increase of Ni content from 1.5 to 4.3% in the Cu crystal does not substantiate the FOR activity. The rate-determining steps of FOR at these electrodes are probed in media of KOH and KOD, revealing a 50% lower FOR peak current at the Cu98.5Ni1.5 (111), but not the Cu(111), electrode in 0.1 M KOD thorn 0.1 M HCHO. The effect of Ni dopant on Cu(111) is considered theoretically by using density functional theory (DFT), showing that the adsorption of H2COOH-, the main species of alkaline HCHO, is increased by the Ni dopant in the Cu matrix. A tiny amount of Ni significantly modifies the electronic structure of the Cu substrate. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there are still many critical challenges for Li-O-2 batteries, such as huge overpotential caused by sluggish oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) kinetics, and inferior cycle life derived from severe side reactions. Designing highly efficient cathode catalysts should be a good choice for Li-O-2 batteries to solve the above problems. Herein, we developed Ir-coated Co nanoparticles confined into highly porous N-doped carbon nanocubes grafted with carbon nanotubes (Ir-Co/HP-NC/CNT) through carbonization of the Co/Zn-zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) and the subsequent Ir-coating. Introduction of Zn into the ZIF precursor not only makes Ir-Co/HP-NC/CNT have high porosity that can promote ion/electron transfer, but also improves the surface content of pyridinic/graphitic N and CoxN phases which accelerate ORR/OER kinetics. Moreover, theoretical calculation/experimental results further confirm that the synergy between the Ir-coating and Co/HP-NC/CNT can effectively alleviate undesired parasitic reactions and also enhance reversibility in Li-O-2 batteries by adjusting Li2O2 formation. As a result, Ir-Co/HP-NC/CNT based Li-O-2 batteries show a super-high discharge capacity of 13 200 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) and a very long cycling life up to 320 cycles at 500 mA g(-1) with a fixed capacity of 1000 mA h g(-1). Importantly, we have also designed large-size bulk-shaped Li-air batteries with Ir-Co/HP-NC/CNT cathodes that exhibit good performance even under bending conditions and effectively power practical electronic devices.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000683493900001

The purpose of this work is to analyze the effect of each alcohol on soot and gas products coming from the pyrolysis of the mixtures compared to the results observed in the pyrolysis of pure acetylene, taken as a reference. Results show that the presence of alcohols always reduces the formation of soot and that the lower the atomic carbon/oxygen (C/O) ratio in the reacting mixture, the higher the soot reduction achieved, mainly due to the enhancement of oxidation reactions by the presence of O in the fuel mixture. The experimental evolution of gas products at the reactor outlet is interpreted through a detailed gas phase chemical kinetic mechanism, which allows insight into the causes for soot reduction by the presence of the different alcohols. This analysis reveals that including methanol in the reacting mixture favours mainly the formation of CO, preventing most of the carbon coming from the alcohol to take part in soot formation and its precursors. The rest of the alcohols not only decompose into oxidation products but they can also form species that may contribute to soot formation. In particular, ethanol promotes the formation of CO and CH4, which come from competing reactions that prevent PAH formation, but also forms C2H4 that may contribute to soot precursors growth. Isopropanol contributes to disfavour PAH formation because it decomposes into CO and CH4, but it also forms C-2 and C-3 hydrocarbons that play an important role in PAH formation and growth. N-butanol enhances oxidation reactions to CO and CH4 formation in a lower degree than the rest of the alcohols and tends to decompose into small hydrocarbons, able to contribute to PAH formation and growth.

A detailed line shape analysis of As(3d) and Ga(3d) levels allows us to identify the oxide phases formed, and to follow their evolution up to coverages of 10 Angstrom. Equivalent amounts of Ga and As oxides are produced. The distribution of As oxides, in particular the As2O3/As2O5 oxide ratio, is found to depend on the electronic current density, whereas no differences are observed for Ga oxides. These changes are discussed in terms of the kinetic constraints introduced by the electron beam and the instability of the As2O5 species upon electron bombardment in vacuum.

As seen by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectroscopy, the mechanism of the electrodeposition included reactions with the used electrolyte as well as with traces of water as sources of oxygen and hydrogen. The lowest band gap energy (E-g) of the films of approximately 1.6 eV was observed for the film electrodeposited at -2.5 V in comparison to 1.9 eV for the films obtained at -2.25 and -2.75 V. The depth profiles of Si and O in the films were registered by XPS, secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GD-OES), which showed that Si and O were relatively uniformly distributed across the entire layer of the film. The n-type photoactivity was associated with the evolution of oxygen from the aqueous solution, and the p-type was attributed to the reductive deterioration of the amorphous SiOx deposit and simultaneous photodecomposition of the electrolyte.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000405469800006

Herein, a novel porous monolayered-Ti3C2Tx@NiCoP (P-Ti3C2Tx@NiCoP) nanostructure was synthesized with uniform distribution of bimetallic compounds for improved charge transfer capability and electrocatalytic activity. In experiments, H2O2-utilized oxidation formed a highly mesoporous structure with a maximized surface area of monolayered MXenes as the support. A subsequent solvothermal process followed by phosphidation enabled successful anchoring of highly HER-active NiCoP nanoclusters onto abundantly exposed terminal edges of the P-Ti3C2Tx support. The structural porosity of the P-Ti3C2Tx nanoflakes played an important role in creating additional room for embedding catalytically active species while stably imparting high electrical conductivity to accelerate charge transfer to NiCoP nanoclusters. With structural modification and effective hybridization, P-Ti3C2Tx@NiCoP showed highly enhanced HER activity with significantly lower overpotentials of 115 and 101 mV at a current density of -10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively, along with showing long-term stability over 60 h. As such, our approach of designing structurally modified-Ti3C2Tx and hybridizing with other electrocatalytically active species would function as a solid platform for implementing Ti3C2Tx-based hetero-nanostructures to achieve state-of-the-art performance in next-generation energy conversion applications.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000674764100001	34477770

Herein, self-supporting expanded graphite sheet (SSEGS) was developed as an ideal catalyst support through electrochemically intercalating flexible graphite sheet in alkaline solution. Electroless deposition was employed to synthesize Ni-Cu-P alloy on SSEGS and then an amorphous NiFe hydroxide/Ni-Cu-P/SSEGS (NiFe-OH/Ni-Cu-P/SSEGS) composite catalyst was further constructed through electrodeposition. Benefitting from the unique structural advantage of SSEGS and the synergistic effect between two amorphous Ni-based materials (Ni-Cu-P alloy and NiFe-OH), the resulting electrode exhibited superior bifunctional electrocatalytic performance in 1 M KOH. For H-2 evolution reaction and O-2 evolution reaction, the NiFe-OH/Ni-Cu-P/SSEGS composite catalyst could reach 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 75 and 240 mV, respectively. Remarkably, the twoelectrode system driven by NiFe-OH/Ni-Cu-P/SSEGS as the anode and cathode could afford 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.56 V vs. RHE. And after the 12 h stability test, the cell voltage at 10 mA cm(-2) increased by only 7 mV, indicating that the two-electrode system had excellent stability. The preparation of NiFe-OH/Ni-Cu-P/SSEGS material with superior bifunctional electrocatalytic performance has a significance influence to the development and expansion of hydrogen production technology.

Despite the enormous amount of research on single transition metal (TM) enhanced graphdiyne (GDY) material, its modification with slightly depleted uranium remains unexplored. Herein, we conducted relativistic density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the accumulation of atomic uranium inside size suitable GDY pore. The stability of graphdiyne-uranium (GDY-U) is corroborated in terms of short U-C bond distances (2.34-2.44 angstrom), with local depletion of charge and greater U(5f)C(p) molecular orbital overlap. The magnificent structural and electronic properties of GDY-U system qualify it for the investigation of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The HER performance of all exposed sites, including central metal atom and four dissimilarly coordinated acetylenic carbons has been examined and compared with that of pure GDY. As the overall HER interfacial descriptor, free energy change of the intermediate state (DGH*) at the central metal surface of GDY-U was found to be most favorable (0.153 eV) amongst all sites and far superior to those of pure GDY. In addition to the uranium surface, the coordinated carbons also show improved HER activity, indicating the enhancement of the system upon metal insertion. The calculated DGH* of the GDY-U system here is comparable to some of the recently reported GDY-TM materials, suggesting that atomic uranium could be an exceptional alternative for applied common catalysts.

The diffraction results show that the synthesized NCM111 has a well-defined layered hexagonal structure. The initial specific discharge capacity of a Li/NCM111 cell is 204.5 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 28 mA g-1 between 2.7 and 4.8 V. However, the cell suffers from poor capacity retention over extended charge-discharge cycles. The structural evolution of NCM111 electrode during electrochemical cycling is carefully investigated by in situ high-resolution synchrotron radiation diffraction. It is found that the nanodomain formation of a layered hexagonal phase H3 and a cubic spinel phase after charging to voltages above 4.6 V is the main source for the structural collapse in c direction and the poor cycling performance. This process is accompanied by the removal of oxygen, the transition metal (TM) migration and the crack generation in the nanodomains of the primary particles. These results may help to better understand the structural degradation of layered cathodes in order to develop high energy density LIBs. (c) The Author(s) 2018. Published by ECS.

These methods are thus unsuitable for electrical applications. Here we report that Ce4+ can act as an effective surface modification reagent for a broad range of substrates (chitinous butterfly wings, carbon paper, nickel foam, and polyethylene terephthalate planks) with various structural features owing to its strong oxidizing ability and Lewis acid nature. The modification yields discrete CeO2 seed layers on substrate surfaces in ca. 0.25-2 h, important for the subsequent conformal growth of CeO2 nanoparticles, Ni(OH)(2) nanowires, FeOOH nanosheets, and WO3 nanosheets into 3D architectured materials. The conformally synthesized FeOOH on nickel foam (NF) yields an overpotential of 241 mV at 10 mA cm(-1) for an oxygen evolution reaction. This value is comparable to a typical catalyst Ni(Fe)OOH-NF for which the Ni/Fe ratio must be well-optimized. This facile and versatile strategy might have broad applications in the conformal fabrication and application of 3D architectured materials, especially when applied in electrical applications of architectured materials (e.g. Li-ion battery).									4	2	0	0	0	0	4			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000459578800005	30664139

We adopt neutral and ion densities measured by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatiles EvolutioN (MAVEN) Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS), electron densities and temperatures measured by the Langmuir Probe and Waves, and ion temperatures measured by the Supra-Thermal and Thermal Ion Composition instruments on the MAVEN spacecraft. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, we find that loss of O-2(+) by dissociative recombination is balanced mainly by production due to the reaction of O+ with CO2, with a smaller contribution due to the reaction of CO2+ with O. We find that the O densities derived from this calculation are larger than those measured by the NGIMS instrument by a factor that averages about 4 over the range of 130-155km. This general conclusion is supported by a newly measured rate coefficient for the reaction of O with CO2+, which is smaller by a factor of about 6 than the only value in the literature, which was measured 47years ago.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			0094-8276	1944-8007		WOS:000410658800001

Initial oxidation of Ni(111) observed by electron emission microscopy: PEEM and MEEM								SURFACE SCIENCE				601	18			3988	3991		10.1016/j.susc.2007.04.048				SEP 15 2007	2007	The initial oxidation of Ni(111) in the temperature range of 550-700 K has been monitored by photoelectron emission microscopy (PEEM) and metastable-atom electron emission microscopy (MEEM). The PEEM and MEEM images show uniform patterns for the chemisorbed overlayer, reflecting the electronic homogeneity as seen at the mu m scale. During the nucleation and lateral growth of oxide, however, the mu m-scale pattern due to the formation of oxide domains appears and its evolution depends strongly on the substrate temperature and dose pressure of gaseous O-2. Our data indicate that the high-temperature oxidation is regarded as a successive multi-nucleation process in a reaction-diffusion field. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

According to the fact that the time evolution of the created hole can affect the molecular reaction and subsequent dynamics difference from its original structure, we studied the dominant frequency variation of caffeine charge oscillation after ionization of outer shell orbital. In this work, we determined the main orbitals participating in the total charge migration process by comparing the dipole moment peaks to the Fourier signals of the time dependent molecular orbitals (MOs) occupation. Having used the Bader charge analysis, we showed that different valence ionization of molecule resulted in a distinct charge migration between different regions, functional groups, and atoms of cations. We represented two interesting different cases: 1-for ionization out from 46th MO of caffeine, the MOs interfere of the cation resulted in a charge migration between oxygen atoms and upper nitrogen of five-membered ring, 2- for ionization out from 39th MO of caffeine, a different behavior of hole occurred according to which the hole spread throughout the whole molecule. Therefore, a specific MO ionization could result in a dramatically different migration and active site of cation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0020-7608	1097-461X		WOS:000663006800001

The synthesis of GNFs might be related to the anodic exfoliation of graphite surface via OH- intercalation, accompanying the dispersion effect of hydrogen/oxygen gases evolution. The preparation of NM NPs/GNFs should be resulted from repeated coupling processes, namely the cathodic deposition of NM NPs and the electrochemical exfoliation-dispersion of NM NPs-decorated graphite layer. The as-prepared products were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-disperse X-ray spectra (EDX), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and inductively coupled plasma (ICP).

The concentration of Pd2+ is the key factor for the density of Pd nanoparticles (Pd NPs) embedded in the carbon shells, which plays a role in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) properties. The ORR and SERS performances of FFPC nanocomposites under different concentrations of PdCl2 are investigated. The optimal ORR performance exhibits that onset potential and tafel slope can reach 0.937 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and 74 mV dec(-1), respectively, which is attributed to the synergistic effects of good electrical conductivity, large electrochemically active areas, and strong interfacial charge polarization. Off-axis electron holography reveals that interfacial charge polarization could facilitate the ORR of Pd NPs and defective carbon simultaneously and the shell with low density of Pd NPs is easier to form strong interfacial charge polarization. Moreover, FFPC-3 with maximum EF of 2.3 x 10(5) results from more hot-spots, local positive charge centers to attract rhodamine 6G molecules, and magnetic cores. This work not only offers a recyclable multifunctional nanocomposite with excellent performance, but also has instructional implications for interfacial engineering for electrocatalysts design.									67	5	0	0	5	0	68			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000459722300016	30650258

The morphology and average growth rate were indicated by scanning electron microscopy which showed that the morphology was highly related to the filament temperature (T-f) and the distance between the filaments and the polished Si (1 0 0) substrates (d(f)). The influence of T-f on the crystalline nature was studied by x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The evolution of stoichiometry and types of defects was indicated by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and slow positron implantation spectroscopy. When T-f was up to 1750 degrees C, tungsten oxide nanostructure was synthesized. A turning point of T-f was found at which the nature of crystallinity and of stoichiometry was the best. As T-f increased to 2100 degrees C or d(f) decreased, the film crystallinity decreased; correspondingly, the component ratio of stoichiometry WO3 decreased and lots of vacancy agglomerates were present. In order to develop the chemical phase from substoichiometry to stoichiometry, the oxygen gas concentration in the mixture gas during deposition should be raised to an appropriate level.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000257839700071

The available estimates of the oxidizing potential of P-680(+), the primary donor of PSII, yield value of about 1.15 V. Two main factors are suggested to add up and engender this high oxidizing potential, namely: (1) the electrostatic influence dominated by Arg-181 of the D2 subunit which elevates the oxidizing potential of P680(+) up to 1 V, some 0.1 V above the E-m value of a hydrogen-bonded chlorophyll a; and (2) the dynamic component of 0.10-0.15 V due to the experimentally demonstrated retarded protonic relaxation at the P-680 site.

Relative ratio of surface and bulk oxygen vacancy, as evidenced with positron annihilation lifetime and X-ray photoelectron spectra, was controllable via adjusting vacuum-deoxidized temperature and time. Photocatalytic performance of the pristine and deoxidized nanosheets for synchronous photocatalytic removal of Cr(VI) and methyl orange (MO) were thoroughly investigated. Control experimental results show that the photocatalytic activities of the BLTO2-x nanosheets significantly relied on vacuum-deoxidized temperature and time. The optimal deoxidized nanosheets as activated at 330 degrees C for 3 h, which has the largest relative concentration of surface oxygen vacancy, shows highest activity under visible light irradiation. Moreover, the synergetic effect for synchronous enhanced photocatalytic degradation of Cr(VI) and MO were observed over all BLTO12-x nanosheets. The detailed synergistic reduction-oxidation removal mechanism is proposed. The surface oxygen vacancy led to rise of valence band maximum, which is responsible for both widening of valence band and decreasing of band gap. The former enhances separation efficiency of photoinduced e-/h + pairs, and the latter extends photoresponse range into visible light region. As a result, compared with pristine BLTO, the visible-light catalytic activity of deoxidization-activated BLTO12-x was significantly enhanced. The vacuum-deoxidized strategy proposed in this work can introduce oxygen vacancy into the matrix of catalyst, which provides an effective way to design and prepare high-efficiency oxides based photocatalyst.

Copolymers exhibiting a random distribution of itaconic acid (IA) along the polymer chain were prepared through free radical polymerization. A regular distribution of IA in the PAI chain was achieved through the continuous addition of IA during polymerization, which compensated for the preferential consumption of IA. PAIs exhibiting block copolymer architectures, in which IA was located in one block, were also prepared by controlled/"living" radical polymerization techniques, in particular by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization. The arrangements of IA in the PAIs significantly affected the crystallite size of the PAIs. During thermal oxidative stabilization (TOS), the PAIs exhibiting regular and block architectures demonstrated superior oxygen uptake capabilities compared with the randomly structured PAIs, suggesting an enhanced efficiency in the structural evolution of the PAIs into carbon materials. The PAIs exhibiting block architectures also displayed the largest graphite crystal sizes upon subsequent carbonization, resulting in superior electronic conductivity. The carbon materials produced through a more efficient TOS and carbonization of the structurally tailored PAIs are promising materials for new applications in the field of advanced carbon technology.

The combination of cobalt and carbon spheres results in the formation of p-n heterojunction. Also, this combination was effective in the separation of photo generated electron-hole pairs. The photocatalytic property of the material was evaluated by employing it for the degradation of both anionic dye methyl orange and cationic dye malachite green in water and it is also used for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Different mass ratios such as 2, 4, 6 and 8 wt% of Co-carbon spheres were employed in the degradation process. However, Co-carbon spheres with mass ratio 6% displayed the best photocatalytic performance. The decoloration and mineralization efficiencies were 89.4% +/- 2.8 and 88.6% +/- 3.2 after 40 min of treatment respectively for methyl orange and malachite green. Scavenger studies further revealed the photo generated holes as the main oxidant and the synergistic effect of cobalt and carbon for excellent photocatalytic efficiency of the material.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			1369-8001	1873-4081		WOS:000587297900005

CATALYSIS TODAY				39	3			145	157		10.1016/S0920-5861(97)82240-7				DEC 17 1997	1997	Photocatalytic water oxidation to O-2 takes place at the solid/water phase boundary of an appropriately prepared thin AgCl layer in the presence of a small excess of Ag+. This water oxidation reaction shows self-sensitization: as the reaction proceeds, the sensitivity is extended from the near-UV-visible towards the red range. This means that new photo active colour centres are formed upon near UV illumination composed of reduced silver species. The quantum yield per redox equivalent for O-2 evolution upon illumination with near UV light (340-390 nm) is similar to 0.8 and it is the same upon illumination with blue light (420-480 nm). In the green range it is similar to 0.5. We discuss parameters controlling these reactions. Some of our observations parallel those made by Henry Fox Talbot 160 years ago when he made his first "photogenic drawings" on silver chloride containing paper.Zeolite microcrystals are investigated as hosts for supramolecular organization of clusters, complexes and molecules. They offer possibilities to design precise and reversible functionalities which have the potential to become useful in a solar energy conversion system because in favourable cases very stable materials have been obtained. The possibility to arrange zeolite microcrystals of good quality and narrow size distribution as dense monograin layers on different types of substrates allows the discovery of specific properties. In the present context, three functionalities are of special importance: intrazeolite ion transport, intrazeolite charge transport and intrazeolite excitation energy transport. All of them have been clearly demonstrated experimentally although there are still some controversies going on. The zeolite acts as a host in each case mentioned. It is not actively involved in the corresponding processes, but provides the necessary geometrical and chemical environment.Favourable conditions for finding an efficient antenna device are a high concentration of monomeric dye molecules with a large Forster energy transfer radius, high luminescence quantum yield and ideal geometrical arrangement of the chromophores, as well as an optimal size of the device. Very interesting supramolecular devices can be realized by enclosing dyes inside a microporous material such that the volume of the cages and channels is able to uptake monomers only, but not aggregates.

Since hydrogen is easier to produce under acidic conditions, the development of electrocatalysts with high activity and stability is particularly important in acidic electrolytes. Based on this, we systematically studied the active sites of transition metal atoms doped RuIr(1 1 1) surface (TM-RuIr(1 1 1), TM = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) through first-principles calculations. We find Zn-RuIr(1 1 1) has the best performance for HER and the Gibbs free energy change of the adsorbed H atom (oGH*)and exchange current reach -0.03 eV and 1.68 A cm-2, which is superior than Pt(1 1 1). Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (COHP) analysis shows the oGH* of adsorption surface with the same configuration is negatively correlated with calculated bond energy. Further Bader charge analysis reveals the doping transition metal changes the electronic properties of Ru atom and Ir atom near the doping site, thereby activating the Ru adjacent to the doped site so that the best active site migrates from Ir to Ru atom. The synergistic effect of Ru and Ir atoms promotes the HER activity on the surface. Our results help to understand the internal mechanism regulating HER activity on the RuIr surface and guide the design and synthesis of high-activity TM-RuIr catalysts.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000652605300005

By aid of the stabilization effects of uncoordinated groups and inherent pore-confinement of amine-functionalized metal-organic frameworks (NH2-MIL-125), two forms of Ru species including nanoparticles (NPs) and/or single atoms (SAs) can be firmly embedded in NH2-MIL-125 derived N-doped TiO2/C support (N-TC), and thus obtain two kinds of samples named Ru-NPs/SAs@N-TC and Ru-SAs@N-TC, respectively. In the synthetic process, the initial feeding amount of Ru(3+)ions not only strongly determines the final size and dispersion states of Ru species but also the morphology and defective structures of N-TC support. Impressively, Ru-NPs/SAs@N-TC exhibit superior catalytic activities to Ru-SAs@N-TC for either electrocatalytic or photocatalytic HER. This should be attributed to its larger specific surface area and benefiting from synergistic coupling of Ru NPs and Ru SAs. It is envisioned that the present work can provide a new avenue for development of high-efficiency and multifunctional hybrid catalysts in sustainable energy conversion.									62	5	0	0	3	0	63			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000539575800001

The CL Spectra were registered and compared with the classical KMnO4 and NaClO-H2O2 CL systems. The characteristic emission peaks at 1268 and 1050 nm were observed, which are consistent to the spectrum obtained from the NaClO-H2O2 system. Additional emission bands at 680 nm further confirmed the formation of singlet oxygen dimers. The high CL intensity and the chemically green nature of K2FeO4, prompt us to further develop it as a novel CL reagent. Sensitive response and wide calibration ranges were obtained for dopamine, ascorbic acid, and ethanol. The linear range for the determination of three analytes were 50 nM to 50 mu M for dopamine (LOD: 20 nM), 5.0 mu M to 1.0 mM for ascorbic acid (LOD: 2.21 mu M), and 0.5 mu M to 1.0 mM for ethanol (LOD: 0.30 mu M).

The enzymes contain a common active centre consisting of four copper ions. The key component for O-2 reduction is the trinuclear copper centre comprising one type II and a pair of type III copper ions. Although the crystal structures of many multicopper oxidases have been determined by X-ray crystallography, the geometric parameters in the trinuclear copper centre are different for each study. Recent studies have revealed that the redox state of copper ions is altered by X-ray irradiation. The reported crystal structures may represent mixtures of different stages of the catalytic reactions. In this review, we discuss recent findings related to the structure of the active site in multicopper oxidases.									35	2	0	0	24	0	37			0021-924X	1756-2651		WOS:000363005300002	26272825

The quartzites underwent a metamorphic evolution characterized by a peak stage (3.5 GPa and 730-820 degrees C) with the anhydrous assemblage coesite+kyanite I, followed by an early near-isothermal decompression stage (2.9 GIa and 705-780 degrees C) with growth of kyanite II, muscovite, and OH-rich topaz, and by decompression-cooling stages, represented by paragonite (1.9 GPa and 700-780 degrees C) and pyrophyllite (0.3 GPa and 400 degrees C) on kyanite (I and II) and OH-rich topaz, respectively. These rocks may exhibit unusually low delta O-18 and delta D values acquired before undergoing UHP metamorphism. Five distinct fluid generations are recognized.

A number of conclusions may be drawn from these relationships that have an effect on fluid evolution in deeply subducted continental rocks. (1) At a pressure of about 3.5 GPa alkali-alumino-silicate aqueous solutions, with compositions intermediate between H2O fluid and melt (H2O > 25 and <= 50 wt %) evolved from quartzites, probably generated by dehydration reactions. (2) During early decompression stages, at the transition from URP to high-pressure (2.9 GPa) conditions, brines Of external origin with higher water contents (82 wt % H2O) initiated the growth of OH-rich topaz and muscovite. (3) The subsequent decompression, at P < 2 GPa, was defined by a limited circulation of NaCl aqueous fluids, and CO2 infiltration. Overall, fluid inclusions and stable isotopes highlight a metamorphic fluid-rock interaction characterized by internally derived intermediate aqueous solutions at UHP, followed by infiltration of Cl-rich brines with higher water activities.									60	11	0	0	1	0	63			0022-3530	1460-2415		WOS:000247565100006

In this work, a Co(OH)(2) nanoparticle decorated CdS nanowire (Co(OH)(2)/CdS) based heterostructured photocatalyst was prepared via a solvothermal and subsequent co-precipitation method, and it was used for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The optimal Co(OH)(2)/CdS photocatalyst achieves a CO production rate of 8.11 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm), which is about 2 times higher than that of bare CdS. The experimental results show that a Co(OH)(2) cocatalyst possesses a great capability of consuming holes, which promotes the oxygen-producing half-reaction and accelerates charge separation, thus enhancing the CO2 photoreduction performance of CdS. Notably, without using complex synthesis processes, hazardous substances or expensive ingredients, Co(OH)(2)/CdS shows high light absorption, efficient charge separation and complete CO product selectivity. This work offers a new pathway for the construction of cost-effective photocatalytic materials to achieve highly efficient CO2 reduction activity by the integration of a Co(OH)(2) cocatalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000670016900001	34231595

The effect of titanium on oxidation resistance and microstructural change of composite coatings were studied. Titanium in superalloys reacted with [N] ions in composite coating due to interdiffusion. The position of reaction zone was determined by the relative content of [N] ions and metallic aluminum in coating. Doping of titanium in alumina lead to a decrease of charged oxygen vacancies but Ti-A1(center dot) forms in this process. The transportation of Ti-A1(center dot) in oxide scale resulted in the formation of TiO2 and a higher oxidation rate of coating.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0010-938X	1879-0496		WOS:000462108000006

In this study, reactive force field molecular dynamics and the GCMC method were utilized to investigate the degradation mechanism for a deformed C-S-H gel subjected to water attack. In the elastic region of the stress-strain relation, no water molecules invaded the deformed C-S-H gel tensioned along the y-direction. On the other hand, in the failure stage, the tension loading stretched/broke the Si-O-Si bond, resulting in the distortion of the "dreierketten'' silicate chain distribution and ordered zigzag sheets built by the calcium oxygen octahedron. More water molecules penetrated into the defective silicate sheets and dissociated into the Si-OH and Ca-OH surrounding the highly reactive non-bridging oxygen sites induced by the silicate chain breakage. The water invasion and hydrolytic reaction reduced the cohesive stress of the tensioned C-S-H structure. Furthermore, the cracks in the calcium silicate sheet connected with the interlayer region, enhancing the channel connectivity for the water transport. This resulted in the water dynamic transformation from the cage stage to the diffusive stage. The high mobility of confined water molecules further weakened the stability of the hydrogen bonds in the calcium silicate skeleton. Moreover, the tensile loading and water attack contributed to the silicate morphological rearrangement. The long silicate chains were first destroyed to form shorter chains and then re-polymerized to form a branch and ring structure to strengthen the weak interlayer regions.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000431821800052	29624195

A two-step method of electrodeposition with subsequently low-temperature phosphatizing is adopted. The physicochemical characterizations of the as-prepared Ni-Co-P/NF show that the surface is covered by metallic phosphide compounds (NiCoP, NiP and Co2P) with unique morphology, consisted of nanosheets randomly dispersed on villiform 3D integrated framework. The electrochemical characterizations demonstrate that Ni-Co-P/NF exhibits the highest performance for HER, in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution, compared to other as-prepared electrocatalysts. Specifically, it requires very low overpotential values of 85, 210 and 350 mV for delivering large current densities of -10, -500 and -1,500 mA cm(-2), respectively, revealing a low Tafel slope of 46 mV dec(-1). Besides, Ni-Co-P/NF also displays long-term durability lasting 24 h without obvious deactivation. This work highlights that the NiCoP, NiP and Co2P active phases play a crucial role for the good HER activity. In addition, the unique morphology with self-supported structure provides large electrochemical surface area, allowing the exposure of higher amount of active sites for HER. These self-supported electrocatalysts, without binder, could also improve the electrode's HER activity and stability. This work, therefore, provides a controllable and feasible strategy to synthesize bimetallic phosphides of unique morphology with high HER activity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It is shown that if spallation occurs predominantly in regions rich in heavy elements, i.e., close to supernovae, the linear relation recently obtained by Gilmore et al. (1992) between beryllium and oxygen abundances for Population II stars may be reproduced. Estimates of relevant timescales for mixing show that the decisive factor, the ratio of the timescale of cosmic-ray diffusion out of the locally enriched regions to the decay time of cosmic rays in the Galaxy as a whole, admits this scenario. Although energetically possible, it requires, however, very high local cosmic-ray fluxes (greater-than-or-equal-to 10(5) cm-2 s-1), which predicts gamma-ray fluxes above those observed from supernova remnants and the Galaxy. We therefore consider other models, such as those given by Duncan et al. (1992) or Prantzos et al. (1993), more probable.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			0004-637X			WOS:A1994MZ15200007

Development of highly efficient, economically viable, and electrochemically stable HER electrocatalysts has accordingly become a prerequisite for practical implementation of large scale water electrolysis. Mono/few-layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) based HER-electrocatalysts have recently garnered great interest due to their diverse tunable electrochemical properties. However, they still face intrinsic limitations such as self-aggregation, rare active sites, high electrical resistance, and long-term electrochemical instability. To tackle these challenges, we designed and synthesized a novel electrocatalyst comprising active site-rich rhenium diselenide (ReSe2) nanoflakes perpendicularly anchored on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheet support via a facile one-step hydrothermal synthesis. The rGO support provides a growing platform for few-layered ReSe2 nanoflakes while facilitating plentiful exposure of edge/corner sites of ReSe2, highly desirable for maximizing the catalytic activity of ReSe2@rGO. The synthesized ReSe2@rGO exhibits a low overpotential of 145.3 mV at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 40.7 mV.dec-1 for the HER process due to the synergistic combination of high surface density of unsaturated coordination sites, remarkably accelerated electron transfer, and enhanced electrochemical stability. This outcome suggests using structurally regulated hybridization of TMDs and graphene as a platform toolkit for developing high performance HER catalysts.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000623322400002

Developing electrocatalysts with high electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at an ultrahigh current density (> 1000 mA cm(-2)) still needs a breakthrough. Here, a bicontinuous nanoporous PtNiMg alloy with an ultralow noble metal content for the HER is fabricated by a facile high-temperature sintering method based on the nanoscale Kirkendall effect. A bicontinuous nanoporous alloy electrode with an ultralow content of approximately 1 at % Pt for the HER in an alkaline medium achieves an extremely low overpotential of 22 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope (30.9 mV dec(-1)) of the Volmer-Tafel mechanism. The alloy electrode for the HER at a wide current density of 1-2000 mA cm(-2) displays superior stability in alkaline media. The 3D bicontinuous nanoporous structure, perfect synergistic effect of Ni and Pt species, high structural stability and excellent conductivity of the 1-PtNiMg-900 alloy achieve outstanding electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability at an ultrawide range of HER current densities. This study greatly improves the electrochemical performance of Pt-based electrocatalysts for the HER via a novel fabrication approach and provides the possibility of large-scale industrial application for H-2 production.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000777263000002

The dye coordinated the IrO2 center dot nH(2)O nanoparticles through a malonate group and the porous TiOz electrode through phosphonate groups. Under visible illumination (lambda > 410 nm) in pH 5.75 aqueous buffer, oxygen was generated at anode potentials positive of -325 mV vs Ag/AgCl and hydrogen was generated at the cathode. The internal quantum yield for photocurrent generation was ca. 0.9%. Steady-state luminescence and time-resolved flash photolysis/transient absorbance experiments were done to measure the rates of forward and back electron transfer. The low quantum yield for overall water splitting in this system can be attributed to stow electron transfer (similar to 2.2 ms) from IrO2 center dot nH(2)O to the oxidized dye. Forward electron transfer does not compete effectively with the back electron transfer reaction from TiO2 to the oxidized dye, which occurred on a time scale of 0.37 ms.									754	16	1	0	113	2	762			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000264791600027	19119815

The electronic absorption and resonance Raman spectra revealed that the structures of heme binding site of all purified mutants were quite similar to that of the wild-type enzyme, although the fraction of the inactivated form, called "P420," was increased. In the reaction with H2O2, only trace amounts of the naphthalene hydroxylation product were detected by gas chromatography. We, therefore, conclude that the three mutants do not exhibit significant changes in the structural and functional properties from those of wild-type P450cam except for the stability of the axial ligand in the reduced form. The enhanced fluorescence in the whole-cell assay would reflect enhancement in the oxygenation activity below the detectable limit of the gas chromatography and/or contributions of other reactions catalyzed by the heme iron.

To identify the best operating conditions, a factorial design was carried out for each process. It was observed that after the optimization of the processes, chemical oxygen demand (COD) removals greater than 88% were achieved. In addition, it was observed that the use of the LED lamp required lower reagent concentrations compared to solar and UV-A sources. A kinetic study was carried out under the best conditions obtained and it was observed that the sources showed rapid evolution, reaching a COD removal equilibrium with 30 min of reaction. Reagent monitoring was also carried out, and it was observed that they were not limiting to the reaction. Phytotoxicity analysis was also satisfactory since the treated effluents allowed a higher relative growth and germination index of the cucumber roots compared to the raw effluent. Finally, the cost analysis indicated that the use of LED lamps resulted in a reduction in electrical consumption compared to the UV-A lamp, as well as a reduction in the cost of reagents due to the lower concentration of reagents required compared to processes assisted by natural sunlight and UV-A.									8	0	0	0	3	0	8			0944-1344	1614-7499		WOS:000604878400012	33394423

The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is receiving attention as an environmentally sustainable NH3 synthesis replacement for the traditional Haber-Bosch process owing to its near ambient reaction conditions (<100 degrees C and 1 atm). However, its NH3 yield and faradaic efficiency are extremely low because of the sluggish kinetics of N N bond disso-ciation and the hindrance from competitive hydrogen evolution. To overcome these challenges, we herein introduce a dual-functionalized ionic liquid (1-(4-hydroxybutyl)-3-methylimidazolium hydroxide [HOBIM]OH) for a highly dispersed ruthenium oxide electrocatalyst to achieve a biased NRR. The observed uniform distribution of RuO2 on the carbon fiber and increase in the surface area for N-2 adsorp-tion by limiting proton access can be attributed to the presence of imidazolium ions. Moreover, extensive N-2 adsorption contributes to enhanced NRR selectivity with an NH3 yield of 3.0 x 10(-10) mol cm(-2) s(-1) (91.8 lg h(-1) mg(-1)) anda faradaic efficiency of 2.2% at-0.20 VRHE. We expect our observations to provide new insights into the design of effective electrode structures for electrochemical NH3 synthesis.

However, the catalytic activity of existing electrocatalysts usually subjects to the limited amount of exposed active sites. Herein, we propose that self-assembled ultrathin NiCo2S4 nanoflakes grown on nickel foam (NiCo2S4/Ni foam) can serve as excellent electrocatalyst for HER in alkaline solution with high activity and stability. The NiCo2S4/Ni foam electrodes were prepared by the complete sulfidation of networked ultrathin NiCo-layered double hydroxide nanoflakes grown on Ni foam (NiCo-LDH/Ni foam). The advantages of this unique architecture are that the ultrathin and porous NiCo2S4 nanoflakes can provide a huge number of exposed active sites, the highly-conductive Ni foam can promote the transfer of electrons, and the three-dimensional-networked structure can facilitate the diffusion and penetration of electrolyte. Electro-chemical measurements reveal that NiCo2S4/Ni foam electrodes exhibit greatly improved performance than NiCo-LDH/Ni foam for HER in alkaline solution with low onset overpotential (17 mV), small Tafel slope (84.5 mV/dec) and excellent long-duration cycling stability (maintaining an onset overpotential of similar to 20 mV and an overpotential of 155 mV at 50 mA/cm(2) after testing for 100,000 s). In addition, the highly-flexible NiCo2S4/Ni foam electrodes show no obvious catalytic degradation after bending for 200 times, confirming the high flexibility and robustness under severe conditions.

Here we demonstrate novel self-supported hierarchical MoS2/CoS2 nanotube arrays as efficient pH-universal electrocatalysts, where Co metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are used as a precursor and sacrificial template to form one-dimensional CoS2 nanotubes surrounded by vertically aligned two-dimensional MoS2 nanosheets. Owing to the achievement of a unique hollow architecture with abundant exposed edges and accelerated reaction kinetics, the self-supported MoS2/CoS2 heterostructure exhibits a superior HER catalytic performance with long-term durability in acidic, neutral and alkaline electrolytes. Impressively, it delivers a current density of 10 mA cm 2 at low overpotentials of 90 mV in acidic media and 85 mV in alkaline media and small Tafel slope values of 30 mV dec 1 in acidic media and 34 mV dec 1 in alkaline media, respectively. Our first-principles calculations reveal that the strong interfacial interactions between MoS2 and CoS2 increase the electronic states at S-S edges and dramatically reduce the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen and the energy barrier for water dissociation. Overall, this work offers an exciting avenue for the rational design of hollow heterogeneous catalyst arrays by MOF-engaged interfacial engineering for scalable hydrogen generation.									88	4	0	0	6	0	90			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000471010900042

The solution quantitatively oxidizes hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and ascorbic acid to dehydroascorbic acid, itself being reduced to Mn-II. In the presence of excess reductant, the reactions follow simple first-order kinetics with no evidence for the accumulation of a significant amount of any intermediate manganese complex. The ascorbate anion shows overwhelming kinetic dominance over ascorbic acid, but no evidence is available for deprotonation of hydrogen peroxide. The preferred intimate mechanism for hydrogen peroxide is inner sphere but that for ascorbic acid is uncertain. For both reductants, increased extent of aquation leads to increased kinetic activity in the order: 1 < 2 < 3.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0008-4042			WOS:000080762100006

Herein, we have synthesized, firstly, three-dimensional (3D) urchin-like NiCo2@Ni1/3Co2/3S2@C catalyst composed of one-dimensional (1D) peapod-like structure, in which the nanoparticles of the peapod are characterized with a special structure: NiCo2 alloy as the core and thin Ni1/3Co2/3S2 layer as the shell. Notably, the internal NiCo2 core offers efficient routes for electron transfer and the external Ni1/3Co2/3S2 shell provides a great number of active sites for HER. Owing to the synergistic effect between the inner core and the outer shell, NiCo2@Ni1/3Co2/3S2@C catalyst displays excellent catalytic performance, including a low overpotential of similar to 41.0 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a corresponding small Tafel slope of similar to 39.2 mV dec(-1), and an excellent stability in acidic medium for 200 h, which is greater than many reported transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs). Simultaneously, the free energy of H* adsorption (Delta G(H*)) for NiCo2@Ni1/3Co2/3S2@C (about -0.10 eV) is extremely near to that for Pt (similar to 0.09 eV) by density functional theory (DFT) calculated results, which is significantly beneficial to HER performance.

Herein, using wafer-like Co(CO3)(0.5)(OH)center dot 0.11H(2)O as template followed by anion-exchange and further phosphorization process, it is synthesized a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical porous heterostructure with highly dispersed ultrafine metallic Co2P nanoparticles uniformly anchored on porous conductive CoWO4 nanofiber matrix, which not only promotes the electron transfer, but also avoids the deterioration of phosphide. In addition, the electron densities re-distribution within the heterostructure also contributes to the improved catalytic activity. Furthermore, the doping of W into Co2P gives proper H adsorption free energy Delta G(H). Impressively, the Co2P/CoWO4/Ni foam (NF) exhibits an overpotential of 81 mV at -10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slop of 47 mV dec(-1) along with supreme long-term durability at -40 mA cm(-2). The present work also demonstrates different dosages of Na2WO4 in the anion-exchange step will lead to different phase compositions and morphologies, giving rise to different HER electrocatalytic performances of the phosphorized samples.

Here we report a simple one-step scalable approach, where MoOx/MoS2 core-shell nanowires and molybdenum disulfide sheets are exposed to dilute aqueous hydrazine at room temperature, which results in marked improvement in electrocatalytic performance. The nanowires exhibit similar to 100 mV improvement in overpotential following exposure to dilute hydrazine, while also showing a 10-fold increase in current density and a significant change in Tafel slope. In situ electrical, gate-dependent measurements and spectroscopic investigations reveal that hydrazine acts as an electron dopant in molybdenum disulfide, increasing its conductivity, while also reducing the MoOx core in the core-shell nanowires, which leads to improved electrocatalytic performance.									159	7	0	0	5	0	162			2041-1723			WOS:000378007900001	27282871

In this work, a biasfree reactor device for the solar-driven conversion of CO2 to synthesis gas (syngas) has been developed. The integrated fluidic device consists of a cathode made of copper foam coated with low-cost nanosized zinc flakes as catalyst to perform the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to syngas, an adapted silicon heterojunction solar cell structure as photoanode with nickel foam as catalyst to facilitate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and a bipolar membrane separating the respective catholyte and anolyte compartments. The membrane allows for the operation of the catholyte and anolyte at different pH values. Stable and tunable hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide (H-2 : CO) ratios between 5 and 0.5 along with high CO Faradaic efficiencies of up to 85% and CO current densities of 39.4 mA cm(-2) have been demonstrated. Under photoelectrolysis conditions, the photovoltage of the photoanode was varied between 0.6 V and 2.4 V by connecting up to four heterojunction solar cells in series, and thus reducing the overall cell voltage solely by solar energy utilization. Bias-free operation of the integrated device has been achieved under ambient conditions with active areas for CO2RR and OER, respectively, of 10 cm(2). An operation current density of 5.0 mA cm(-2) was measured under 100 mW cm(-2) illumination of the complete device, which corresponds to a solar-to-syngas conversion efficiency of 4.3%.									90	3	0	0	5	0	91			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000412765600019

The surface morphology, compositions and crystallographic structure of 3D-sphere PbO2 electrode were investigated fully by using the field emission scanning electron (SEM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), respectively. The comparative studies between 3D-sphere PbO2 electrode and traditional flat PbO2 electrode (flat-PbO2) indicated that the 3D-sphere PbO2 electrode with novel structure had smaller grain size. The electrochemical performances of the 3D-sphere PbO2 electrode were carried out by using cyclic voltammograms (CV), linear sweep voltammograms (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and accelerated service life, respectively. The results show that the 3D-sphere PbO2 electrode has larger electrochemical active surface area, higher oxygen evolution potential and lower charge transfer resistance, leading to it possesses better stable service life on process of degradation than that the flat-PbO2 electrode. Furthermore, the 3D-sphere PbO2 electrode showed the best performance on degradation of phenol in simulated wastewater by bulk electrolysis. The removal efficiency of phenol could reach about 96.5% after 120 min under the optimal current density (30 mA cm(-2)) at room temperature, which was higher than that by using the flat-PbO2 electrode (73.1%). In addition, the reaction rate constant (k) of 3D-sphere PbO2 electrode degrading phenol solution was 0.0277 min(-1) which was 2.56 times larger than that of flat-PbO2 electrode (0.0108 min(-1)). Summarily, the 3D-sphere electrode is a promising electrode in treating wastewater. (c) 2017 The Electrochemical Society.

The cathodic polarization curves were almost linear and similar in all binary and ternary solution mixtures and resembled that of the hydrogen evolution reaction. However, in ternary solution mixtures of H3PO4, H2SO4, and HCOOH, the shape of the curves indicated composite reactions of hydrogen and oxygen reduction. Anodic polarization curves showed active, passive, and transpassive behaviors in all the solution mixtures. When H2SO4, CH3COOH, or HCOOH was added to H3PO4, the aggressive nature of the binary solution mixtures toward the alloy was intensified in the same order. Thus, maximum corrosion was observed in the case of binary solutions of H3PO4 with HCOOH. However, in the ternary solution mixtures, the corrosion of the alloy decreased. In the transpassive region, a secondary current peak and cur-rent plateau were observed in most cases. However, electropolishing was not achieved in these solution mixtures. The mass-transfer-controlled condition is probably not achieved in such cases even when a current plateau is observed. Resulting surface morphologies were characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), A smoothing action was observed in the transpassive region.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0010-9312			WOS:000176355600006

Here, we have fabricated ruthenium dioxide-poly(vinyl chloride)-Nafion (RuO2-PVC-Nafion) composite for direct glucose sensing in sodium hydroxide and phosphate buffer nonenzymatically for the first time. The restricted activity of the RuO2-PVC film electrode in alkaline pH is extended to neutral pH using Nafion as an outer membrane, which reduces the distance between Ru active sites by bridging effect and improves the electrode stability. The catalytic rate, measured in terms of change of RuO2 resistance, is similar irrespective of the medium for the high temperature annealed RuO2 (700 A degrees C), whereas the low temperature annealed RuO2 (300 A degrees C) is highly sensitive for the change in the pH of the solution. This is revealed by observing large Michaelis-Menten kinetic constant K (M) for the RuO2 (700 A degrees C) than the low temperature annealed RuO2 (300 A degrees C) due to effective increase in the catalytic active sites similar to oxygen evolution reaction. Contrast to this, the buffer solution does not influence significantly the apparent K (M) observed for RuO2 (300 A degrees C) and has greater impact on the high temperature 500 and 700 A degrees C annealed RuO2 samples. Cyclic voltammetry, chrono amperommetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction techniques are used for characterization of the sensor behavior. The RuO2-PVC-Nafion senses glucose selectively in the presence of potential interferences like fructose, galactose, mannose, sucrose, starch, uric acid, ascorbic acid, dopamine, and catechol in NaOH and phosphate buffer. Glucose sensing in the blood serum of the diabetic and nondiabetic patients is made. The results suggest that the RuO2-PVC-Nafion is a promising candidate for the development of nonenzymatic glucose sensors.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000316088000003

Herein, we report the synthesis of a new class of ultrathin metallic CuFeS2 nanosheets (NSs) with abundant exposed high-index {0 (2) over bar4} facets. They serve as a robust catalyst for the HER with a lower onset potential of 28.1 mV, an over-potential of only 88.7 mV (at j = 10 mA cm(-2)) and remarkable long-term stability in 0.5 M H2SO4, which make them the best system among all the reported non-noble metal catalysts. The theoretical calculations reveal that the mechanistic origin for such a high HER activity should be attributed to the excess S(2-)active sites on the exposed {0 (2) over bar 4} high-index facets of CuFeS2 NSs, which have a rather favorable Gibbs free energy for atomic hydrogen adsorption. The present work highlights the importance of designing ultrathin metallic chalcopyrite nanosheets with high-index facets in order to increase the number of active sites for boosting the HER performance.									49	4	0	0	2	0	49			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000411293800039	28654106

Interfacial engineering at the atomic level is the main approach to design high performance of electrocatalysts. Herein, an interfacial modulation strategy is proposed to fabricate monolayer amorphous MoS2 nanoparticles with an average of 3.5 nm in diameter stuck in multilayer N-doped carbon (MoS2/NC), boosting a high HER activity. The amorphous MoS2 could provide more edge active sites and NC layers endow the fast electron transfer. The XPS, Raman spectra and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the CeS bond in MoS2/NC provides the fast electron transfer and decreases H binding energy. Benefiting the unique sandwiched structure, the MoS2/NC boosts a low overpotential of 152.6 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 60.3 mV dec(-1), and outstanding long-term stability with 97.3% retention for over 24 h. This strategy provides a new opportunity and development of interfacial engineering for turning intrinsic catalytic activity for water splitting. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

J	Singer, D.								Why 37 degrees C? Evolutionary fundamentals of thermoregulation								ANAESTHESIST				56	9			899	+		10.1007/s00101-007-1220-y				SEP 2007	2007	Homeothermy is the result of an evolutionary process during which every increase in oxygen supply led to a consecutive increase in metabolic rate and, thus, to a new dependence on favorable ambient conditions. In response to the food scarcity of winter months, some inhabitants of temperate zones developed an ability to hibernate which is characterized by a fully thermocontrolled reduction in body temperature down to near zero values. Hibernation thus illustrates that in homeotherms, not only the body shell is poikilothermic, but also the core temperature is more variable than often assumed. However, in contrast to clinical hypothermia, natural torpidity does not consist of a cold-induced reduction in metabolic rate, but of an endogenous metabolic reduction with subsequent lowering of body temperature. As a factor of metabolic suppression, the pH has been suspected which, in hibernators, is kept constant at 7.4 by relative hypoventilation (pH-stat) which differs from its passive shift in the poikilothermic body shell (alpha-stat). In clinical hypothermia, temperature governs the metabolic rate in that, depending on the state of thermoregulation, either a cold defense reaction with an increased metabolic rate (accidental hypothermia) or a cold-induced reduction in metabolic rate (induced hypothermia) occurs. However, as can be learned from hibernators, the lower limit of hypothermia tolerance seems to be due to a uniform minimal metabolic rate rather than to the species-specific body temperature at which this metabolic limit is reached, depending on body size and basal metabolic rate. Accordingly, in judging the sequelae of hypothermia, the degree of cooling should be given less emphasis than the resulting effects on metabolic rate.									14	1	0	0	8	0	16			0003-2417	1432-055X		WOS:000249621700009	17763837

In the ozonation processes, the removal of substrate (COD) and aromatic compounds, the decreases in BOD5 and pH, and the ozone consumed in the reaction were evaluated. A kinetic study was conducted that led to the evaluation of the stoichiometric ratio for the chemical reaction, as well as the rate constants for the substrate reduction and ozone disappearance. In the single aerobic degradation treatment, the evolution of substrate and biomass was monitored during the process, and a kinetic study was performed by applying the Contois model to the experimental data, giving the specific biokinetic constant, the cell yield coefficient, and the rate constant for the microorganism death phase. Finally, a combined process was performed, consisting in the aerobic degradation of pre-ozonated wastewaters, and the effect of such chemical pretreatment on the substrate removal and kinetic parameters of the later biological stage is discussed.									19	2	0	0	14	0	22			1093-4529			WOS:000177310200010	15328694

Many oxidoreductases, including components of membrane-bound electron-transfer chains in living organisms, are extremely active when directly attached to an electrode, at which they display their inherent catalytic activity as electrical current. Electrocatalytic voltammograms, which show the rate of electron flow at steady-state, provide direct information on enzyme efficiency with regard to optimising use of available energy, a factor that would have driven early evolution. Oxidoreductases have evolved to minimise energy wastage (overpotential requirement') across electron-transport chains where rate and power must be maximised for a given change in Gibbs energy, in order to perform work such as proton pumping. At the elementary level (uncoupled from work output), redox catalysis by many enzymes operates close to the thermodynamically reversible limit. Examples include efficient and selective electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO or formate - reactions that are very challenging at the chemistry level, yet appear almost reversible when catalysed by enzymes. Experiments also reveal the fleeting existence of reversible four-electron O-2 reduction and water oxidation by blue' Cu oxidases, another reaction of great importance in realising a future based on renewable energy. Being aware that such enzymes have evolved to approach perfection, chemists are interested to know the minimal active site structure they would need to synthesise in order to mimic their performance.									45	2	0	0	10	0	46			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000464383500003	30426997

They display extremely low oxygen isotopic ratios, O-16/O-18 similar or equal to 1-10, C-12/C-13 >= 100, and enhancements up to 2.6 dex in F and in s-process elements from Zn to La, compared to solar. These abundances provide stringent constraints on the physical processes during and after the double-degenerate merger. As shown previously, O-isotopic ratios observed in RCB stars cannot result from the dynamic double-degenerate merger phase, and we now investigate the role of the long-term one-dimensional spherical post-merger evolution and nucleosynthesis based on realistic hydrodynamic merger progenitor models. We adopt a model for extra envelope mixing to represent processes driven by rotation originating in the dynamical merger. Comprehensive nucleosynthesis post-processing simulations for these stellar evolution models reproduce, for the first time, the full range of the observed abundances for almost all the elements measured in RCB stars: O-16/O-18 ratios between 9 and 15, C-isotopic ratios above 100, and similar to 1.4-2.35 dex F enhancements, along with enrichments in s-process elements. The nucleosynthesis processes in our models constrain the length and temperature in the dynamic merger shell-of-fire feature as well as the envelope mixing in the post-merger phase. s-process elements originate either in the shell-of-fire merger feature or during the post-merger evolution, but the contribution from the asymptotic giant branch progenitors is negligible. The post-merger envelope mixing must eventually cease similar to 10(6) yr after the dynamic merger phase before the star enters the RCB phase.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			0004-637X			WOS:000321673700059

The introduction of carbon substrates improves the electrical conductivity and stability of pFeMOF. The presence of carbon also reduces the size of pFeMOF crystallites, leading to more active sites. The catalysts were used to electrocatalysis of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Electrochemical measurements show that pFeMOF/PG has better electrocatalytic efficiency than pFeMOF/OMC, pFeMOF/MPC and pFeMOF. The HER on pFeMOF/PG displays a small onset potential of -34.37 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), a low Tafel slope of 73.06 mV dec(-1), a small over-potential of 154.71 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The catalytic effect for H2O2 is also satisfied. The linearity range of H2O2 is as wide as 5-4310 mu M, and the sensitivity is as high as 77.38 A mM(-1). Such splendid performances may be attributed to the crumpled structure of PG leading to evenly and smaller pFeMOF. Furthermore, abundant hierarchical pores of pFeMOF/PG result in larger electrochemically surface areas. Our work may provide a new approach to design efficient non precious metal catalysts.

In the cluster NGC 2419 we assume the presence of an extreme population directly formed from the AGB and SAGB ejecta, so we can directly compare the yields for a metallicity Z = 0.0003 with the chemical inventory of the cluster NGC 2419. At such a low metallicity, the HBB temperatures (well above 10(8) K) allow a very advanced nucleosynthesis. Masses similar to 6 M-circle dot deplete Mg and synthesize Si, going beyond Al, so this latter element is only moderately enhanced; sodium cannot be enhanced. The models are consistent with the observations, although the predicted Mg depletion is not as strong as in the observed stars. We predict that the oxygen abundance must be depleted by a huge factor (>50) in the Mg-poor stars. The HBB temperatures are close to the region where other p-capture reactions on heavier nuclei become possible. We show that high potassium abundance found in Mg-poor stars can be achieved during HBB by p-captures on the argon nuclei, if the relevant cross section(s) are larger than listed in the literature or if the HBB temperature is higher. Finally, we speculate that some calcium production is occurring owing to proton capture on potassium. We emphasize the importance of a strong effort to measure a larger sample of abundances in this cluster.									41	0	0	0	0	0	41			2041-8205			WOS:000312494600015

Substantial research has been dedicated to these areas in the last few decades. These reductions require both electrons and protons and their thermodynamic potentials often make them compete with hydrogen evolution reaction i.e., the reaction of protons and electrons to generate H-2. These reactions are abundant in the environment in microorganisms and are facilitated by naturally occurring enzymes. This review brings together the state-of-the-art knowledge in the area of enzymatic reduction of CO2, NO2- and H+ with those of artificial molecular electrocatalysis. A simple ligand field theory-based design principle for electrocatalysts is first described. The electronic structure considerations developed automatically yield the basic geometry required and the 2(nd) sphere interactions which can potentially aid the activation and the further reduction of these small molecules. A systematic review of the enzymatic reaction followed by those reported in artificial molecular electrocatalysts is presented for the reduction of CO2, NO2- and H+. The review is focused on mechanism of action of these metalloenzymes and artificial electrocatalysts and discusses general principles that guide the rates and product selectivity of these reactions. The importance of the 2(nd) sphere interactions in both enzymatic and artificial molecular catalysis is discussed in detail.									34	0	0	0	3	0	33			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000635214300006	33514959

While the first examples of high-entropy oxides and oxyfluorides show good cycling performance, they suffer from various problems. Here, we report on side reactions leading to gas evolution in Li-ion cells using rock-salt (Co0.2Cu0.2Mg0.2Ni0.2Zn0.2)O (HEO) or Li(Co0.2Cu0.2Mg0.2Ni0.2Zn0.2)OF (Li(HEO)F). Differential electrochemical mass spectrometry indicates that a robust solid-electrolyte interphase layer is formed on the HEO anode, even when using an additive-free electrolyte. For the Li(HEO)F cathode, the cumulative amount of gases is found by pressure measurements to depend strongly on the upper cutoff potential used during cycling. Cells charged to 5.0 V versus Li+/Li show the evolution of O-2, H-2, CO2, CO and POF3, with the latter species being indirectly due to lattice O-2 release as confirmed by electron energy loss spectroscopy. This result attests to the negative effect that lattice instability at high potentials has on the gassing.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20				2566-6223		WOS:000512565300001

Likewise, host plants have also evolved with diversified NLR proteins as a survival strategy to win the battle against pathogen invasion. NLR protein indeed detects pathogen derived effector proteins leading to the activation of defense responses associated with programmed cell death (PCD). In this interactive process, genome structure and plasticity play pivotal role in the development of innate immunity. Despite being quite conserved with similar biological functions in all eukaryotes, the intracellular NLR immune receptor proteins happen to be structurally distinct. Recent studies have made progress in identifying transcriptional regulatory complexes activated by NLR proteins. In this review, we attempt to decipher the intracellular NLR proteins mediated surveillance across the evolutionarily diverse taxa, highlighting some of the recent updates on NLR protein compartmentalization, molecular interactions before and after activation along with insights into the finer role of these receptor proteins to combat invading pathogens upon their recognition. Latest information on NLR sensors, helpers and NLR proteins with integrated domains in the context of plant pathogen interactions are also discussed.									10	1	0	0	10	0	12			0168-9452			WOS:000430523300009	29606220

Developing unique nanostructures of active components (e.g., metal oxides) and carbon materials is essential for their application in next generation electrode materials for fuel cells and metal-air batteries. Herein, a general approach for the production of 1D porous nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon fibers embedded with active ORR components, (M/MOx, i.e., metal or metal oxide nanoparticles) using a facile two-step electrospinning and annealing process is reported. Metal nanoparticles/nanoclusters nucleate within the polymer nanofibers and subsequently catalyze graphitization of the surrounding polymer matrix and following oxidation, create an interconnected graphite-metal oxide framework with large pore channels, considerable active sites, and high specific surface area. The metal/metal oxide@N-doped graphitic carbon fibers, especially Co3O4, exhibit comparable ORR catalytic activity but superior stability and methanol tolerance versus Pt in alkaline solutions, which can be ascribed to the synergistic chemical coupling effects between Co3O4 and robust 1D porous structures composed of interconnected N-doped graphitic nanocarbon rings. This finding provides a novel insight into the design of functional electrocatalysts using electrospun carbon nanomaterials for their application in energy storage and conversion fields.									43	6	0	0	3	0	45			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000427592400010	29356313

However, endowing the electrode-electrolyte interface with high stability and fast electron/ion transportation is still a great challenge. Herein, we report a bioinspired interfacial engineering strategy to construct a cactus-like hybrid electrode comprising CoSe2 nanoparticles embedded in an N-doped carbon nanosheet arrays penetrated with carbon nanotubes (CoSe2-NCNT NSA). Associated with the synergistic effect of highly active CoSe2 nanoparticles and N-doped carbon moieties and a stable 3D interconnected CNT network, the obtained self-standing electrode exhibits satisfactory catalytic activities towards oxygen evolution/reduction and hydrogen evolution, as well as an enhanced electrode-electrolyte interaction/interface area, and thus delivers superior performance for flexible Zn-air batteries. Remarkably, the fabricated flexible Zn-air battery with this CoSe2-NCNT NSA cathode achieves a high peak power density (51.1 mW cm(-2)), considerable mechanical flexibility, and excellent durability in a wide temperature range of 0 to 40 degrees C. Furthermore, the assembled Zn-air batteries can efficiently power a water-splitting device that adopts the CoSe2-NCNT NSA as both the anode and cathode, demonstrating promising potential in energy conversion and portable electronic applications.									26	1	0	0	0	0	26			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000617768200028	33514961

Herein, we discover a volcanic relationship between oxidation state and hydrogen evolution reaction activity based on Os single-atom catalysts. Firstly, a series of Os SACs with oxidation states ranging from + 0.9 to + 2.9 are synthesized via modifying the coordination environments, including Os-N3S1, Os-N-4, Os-S-6, Os-C-3, and Os-C4S2. A volcano-type relation between oxidation states and hydrogen evolution activity emerge with a summit at a moderate experimental oxidation state of + 1.3 (Os-N3S1). Mechanism studies illustrate that with increasing oxidation states, the adsorption of H atoms on Os is strengthened due to increased energy level and decreased occupancy of anti-bonding states of Os-H bond until the anti-bonding states become empty. Further increasing the oxidation states weakens hydrogen adsorption because of the decreased occupancy of Os-H bonding states. In this work, we emphasize the essential role of oxidation state in manipulating activity, which offers insightful guidance for the rational design of single-atom catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2041-1723		WOS:000863903100017	36195616

However, it is still a great challenge to develop electrocatalysts with high activity similar to platinum or even higher, especially those that can work under alkaline conditions. Ruthenium (Ru), as a cheap substitute for platinum, has been studied as a feasible substitute for (HER) catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction. In this paper, we designed and developed a novel Ru catalyst (Ru@CNT) supported on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes. Electrochemical tests show that even under alkaline conditions (1 M KOH), Ru@CNT still shows excellent catalytic performance and good durability. It only needs 36.69 mV overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and its Tafel slope is 28.82 mV dec(-1). The catalytic performance of the catalyst is comparable to that of 20% Pt/C. The significant activity is mainly attributed to the chelation of highly dispersed ruthenium atoms on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes. Secondly, the one-dimensional pore structures supported by nitrogen heterocarbon nanotubes can provide more opportunities for active centers. Excellent HER performance makes Ru@CNT electrocatalyst have a broad application prospect in practical hydrogen production.									9	1	0	0	1	0	9				2046-2069		WOS:000544401200002	35514595

TheCoNi/IL-rGO described excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the selective adsorption of bimetallic CoNi for chlorophene hydrodechlorination (HDC). The prepared electrocatalyst was characterized by SEM, TEM, XPS, Raman spectroscopy, XRD, and UV-vis spectroscopy. Results indicated that ILs could be functionalized by pi-pi stacking on the rGO surface. The optimal bimetallic CoNi NPs (Co-to-Ni weight ratio of 2.5: 2.5) with small particles sizes (3.33 +/- 0.03 nm) were uniformly dispersed on the surface of IL-rGO (mass ratio of IL: GO was 2: 1) among a series of as-prepared catalysts. The IL on the rGO surface could prevent rGO agglomeration and provide sufficient binding sites to anchor the CoNi NPs via electrostatic interaction. Co(2.5) Ni(2.5)/IL(2)-rGO demonstrated low impedance (7.5 Omega) and diffusion resistance due to the introduction of IL. Co(2.5) Ni(2.5)/IL(2)-rGO exhibited a high peak current (-0.35 mA), preferred two-electron selectivity and high H2O2 productivity (> 80%) toward ORR in an alkaline solution. The possible dechlorination mechanism of chlorophene was ascribed to the combination of adsorbed hydrogen on Co and adsorbed chlorophene on Ni.

A hybrid layer of various compositions of P2- and P3-SWNTs forms free-standing membranes (similar to 80 mu m in thickness), and their electrochemical performance was evaluated as an air electrode AEP(2/P3) in zinc-air batteries. Such bifunctionalized air electrodes showed uniform surface morphology with interconnected micron-sized porous structure with high porosity (similar to 70%). The N-2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K are of type IV with BET-specific surface areas of AE((60/40)) and AE((80/20)) to be 130.54 and 158.76 m(2) g(-1), respectively, thus facilitates high active surface area for active oxygen reduction/evolution reactions. BJH pore size distribution of AE((60/40)) and AE((80/20)) shows maximum pores with diameter < 15 nm. The zigzag interlaying of the SWNTs imparts mechanical stability and flexibility in zinc-air batteries. Zinc-air batteries with optimized compositions of P2- and P3-SWNTs in air electrode AE((60/40)) had ionic conductivity similar to 1 x 10(-2) S cm(-1) and delivered higher discharge capacity similar to 300 mAh g(-1) as compared to AE((80/20)) composition. The unique properties of AE((P2/P3)) studied in this work would enable flexible air electrode architectures in future metal-air batteries.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			1432-8488			WOS:000301983300034

These steps, known collectively as photoactivation, involve the photoassembly of the free inorganic cofactors to the cofactor-depleted PSII-(apo-WOC) driven by light and produce the active O-2-evolving core comprised of Mn4CaOxCly. We focus on the functional role of the inorganic components as seen through the competition with non-native cofactors ("inorganic mutants") on water oxidation activity, the rate of the photoassembly reaction, and on structural insights gained from EPR spectroscopy of trapped intermediates formed in the initial steps of the assembly reaction. A chemical mechanism for the initial steps in photoactivation is given that is based on these data. Photoactivation experiments offer the powerful insights gained from replacement of the native cofactors, which together with the recent X-ray structural data for the resting holoenzyme provide a deeper understanding of the chemistry of water oxidation. We also review some new directions in research that photoactivation studies have inspired that look at the evolutionary history of this remarkable catalyst. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, a room-temperature spontaneous redox approach to fabricate a core-shell-structured Au@CeO2 composite, with Au nanoparticle sizes below about 10 nm and a loading amount of 3.6 wt %, is reported for the NRR. The results demonstrate that as-synthesized Au@CeO2 possesses a surface area of 40.7 m(2) g(-1) and a porous structure. As an electrocatalyst, it exhibits high NRR activity, with an NH3 yield rate of 28.2 mu g h(-1) cm(-2) (10.6 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1), 293.8 mu g h(-1) mg(Au)(-1)) and a faradaic efficiency of 9.50 % at -0.4 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.01 m H2SO4 electrolyte. The characterization results reveal the presence of rich oxygen vacancies in the CeO2 nanoparticle shell of Au@CeO2; these are favorable for N-2 adsorption and activation for the NRR. This has been further verified by theoretical calculations. The abundant oxygen vacancies in the CeO2 nanoparticle shell, combined with the Au nanoparticle core of Au@CeO2, are electrocatalytically active sites for the NRR, and thus, synergistically enhance the conversion of N-2 into NH3.									45	5	0	0	1	0	46			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000467184600012	30767346

This route enabled nanomaterials presenting tuned morphology, surface composition and oxide-rGO interactions as revealed by the different characterization techniques. Indeed, nanostructures varied from broom-like, chrysanthemum-like to micro-sized sheet-like morphologies. The amount of Co(3)O(4)phase was shown to be gradually rising as the urea amount increases being always higher at the surface than in the bulk. Different oxide-rGO interactions have also been demonstrated, suggesting that high amounts of urea cause a decrease in the size of the nanoparticles and limit their superposition. The catalysts prepared at high urea concentrations showed more exposed electroactive surface and enhanced activity as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the most active nanocomposite exhibited remarkable stability, making it a very promising candidate for the elaboration of a stable and truly reversible air electrode in alkaline media.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000576084600001

Influence of preparation temperature on the average grain size of the particles is investigated, followed by discussion. At low preparation temperatures nucleation dominates the process while growth of the particles becomes a controlling factor at high temperatures. The as prepared anatase titania nanoparticles show a surface area as high as 180 m(2) g(-1). The transformation temperature of the high surface area nanoparticles from anatase to rutile is as high as 700-1000 degreesC, which is about 200 degreesC higher than that of the particles prepared by spray hydrolysis method.

PtRu/C and Ru/C catalysts were used in gas diffusion cathodes for the reduction of humidified CO2. An IrRuOx catalyst was used for the oxygen evolution from liquid water at the anode. This electrochemical reactor employed a perfluorosulfonic acid membrane electrolyte separator (Nafion((R))) and it was operated in a temperature range from 30 degrees C to 95 degrees C. The cathode catalysts were characterized by well- dispersed metal nanoparticles (2 nm mean particle size) on a carbon black support. Electrochemical polarization tests were carried out in the presence of CO2 or with humidified inert gas for comparison. The results evidenced that direct CO2 reaction on the catalysts surface was essentially occurring at low cell voltages (< 1.6 V), whereas the occurrence of water splitting (hydrogen evolution) was largely prevailing at high cell voltages. Methanol for the PtRu/ C catalyst, or a mixture of alcohols (methanol, ethanol and iso- propanol) for the Ru/ C catalyst were produced under steady- state chronoamperometric tests at low cell potentials (1.6 V). The productivity of methanol at the PtRu electrode increased significantly with temperature and showed maximum production rate at 1.25 V corresponding to a voltage efficiency better than 90%. A critical issue is represented by the parallel hydrogen evolution process, which occurs at significant rates in the overall range of potentials reducing the current efficiency for CO2 conversion.

J	Wombwell, Claire; Reisner, Erwin								Synthesis, structure and reactivity of Ni site models of [NiFeSe] hydrogenases								DALTON TRANSACTIONS				43	11			4483	4493		10.1039/c3dt52967c				2014	2014	A series of structural models of the Ni centre in [NiFeSe] hydrogenases has been developed which exhibits key structural features of the Ni site in the H-2 cycling enzyme. Specifically, two complexes with a hydrogenase-analogous four-coordinate 'NiS3Se' primary coordination sphere and complexes with a 'NiS2Se2' and a 'NiS4' core are reported. The reactivity of the complexes towards oxygen and protons shows some relevance to the chemistry of [NiFeSe] hydrogenases. Exposure of a 'NiS3Se' complex to atmospheric oxygen results in the oxidation of the selenolate group in the complex to a diselenide, which is released from the nickel site. Oxidation of the selenolate ligand on Ni occurs approximately four times faster than oxidation with the analogous sulfur complex. Reaction of the complexes with one equivalent of HBF4 results in protonation of the monodentate chalcogenolate and the release of this ligand from the metal centre as a thiol or selenol. Unrelated to their biomimetic nature, the complexes serve also as molecular precursors to modify electrodes with Ni-S-Se containing particles by electrochemical deposition. The activated electrodes evolve H-2 in pH neutral water with an electrocatalytic onset potential of -0.6 V and a current density of 15 mu A cm(-2) at -0.75 V vs. NHE.									41	0	0	0	4	0	41			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000332389700035	24366040

We combine in situ surface-enhanced IR absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) and electrochemical kinetic studies to probe the mechanistic basis for kinetic bifurcation between H-2 and CO production on polycrystalline Au electrodes. Under the conditions of CO2 reduction catalysis, electrogenerated CO species are irreversibly bound to Au in a bridging mode at a surface coverage of similar to 0.2 and act as kinetically inert spectators. Electrokinetic data are consistent with a mechanism of CO production involving rate-limiting, single-electron transfer to CO2 with concomitant adsorption to surface active sites followed by rapid one-electron, two-proton transfer and CO liberation from the surface. In contrast, the data suggest an H-2 evolution mechanism involving rate-limiting, single-electron transfer coupled with proton transfer from bicarbonate, hydronium, and/or carbonic acid to form adsorbed H species followed by rapid one-electron, one-proton, or H recombination reactions. The disparate proton coupling requirements for CO and H-2 production establish a mechanistic basis for reaction selectivity in electrocatalytic fuel formation, and the high population of spectator CO species highlights the complex heterogeneity of electrode surfaces under conditions of fuel-forming electrocatalysis.									222	4	0	0	26	0	223			0027-8424			WOS:000381293300005	27450088

While the majority of 2e(-) WOR studies have focussed on electrocatalyst design, little research has been carried out on the selection of the supporting electrolyte. In this work, we investigate the impact of potassium carbonate (K2CO3) electrolytes, and their key properties, on H2O2 production. We found that at electrolyte pH values (>9.5) where the carbonate anion (CO32-) was prevalent in the mixture, a 26.5 % increase in the Faraday efficiency (%FE) for H2O2 production was achieved, compared to bicarbonate (HCO3-) dominant solutions. Utilising boron-doped diamond (BDD) in highly concentrated K2CO3 solutions, current densities of up to 511 mA cm(-2) (in 4 m) and %FEs of 91.5 % (in 5 m) could be attained. The results presented in this work highlight the influence of CO32- on electrochemical H2O2 generation via the 2e(-) WOR and provide novel pathways to produce desirable commodities at the anode during electrochemical water splitting.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000750305300001	34935302

Nevertheless, the photocatalytic H2O2 production activity is greatly regulated by the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e- O2RR). Herein, we demonstrate a robust single atom photocatalyst (NiCN-x, Ni single atoms anchored on ultrathin g-C3N4) for artificial H2O2 production under visible light irradiation. A high H2O2 generation rate of 27.11 mmol g- 1h- 1 and an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 8.56 % at 400 nm are both obtained in the optimal NiCN-4 photocatalytic system. Furthermore, NiCN-4 catalyst shows relatively high selectivity of H2O2 with 87.3 % through using a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) measurement. Furthermore, NiCN-4 shows enhanced photocatalytic TC decomposition with degradation efficiency of 89.4 %. Based on DFT calculation, experimental results and advanced characterizations, we find that the high photocatalytic performance is attributed to the boosting 2e- O2RR process with the formation of Ni-mu-peroxide (Ni-OOH) and the unique electronic feature of Ni-Nx coordination sites. This study offers a new blueprint for the fabrication of single atom catalysts (SACs) to achieve artificial photosynthesis of H2O2 with high selectivity and degradation of organic pollutants.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000810334400002

This has been attributed to the lack in these materials of the chlorophyll a,b-binding (CAB) proteins, We now found that a thylakoid-like, oscillatory pattern of proton release was restored simply by the addition of glycerol which modifies the protein-protein interaction, Being a further proof for the electrostatic origin of the greater portion of proton release, this effect will serve as an important tool in further studies of water oxidation.

This study describes a simple synthesis of SnO2-x/Sb2O3 composite by the mechanical milling method. The coupling of SnO2-x possessing oxygen vacancies (OVs) with Sb2O3 is a new approach for obtaining materials with outstanding photocatalytic properties. For the photo-oxidation of isopropanol (IPA) within 5 h, the acetone yield over SnO2-x/Sb2O3 composite with mass ratio of 1:4 was 22.67 and 10.5 times higher than those of SnO2-x and Sb2O3, respectively, and the carbon dioxide output was 13.29 and 7.46 times higher than those of SnO2-x and Sb2O3, respectively. This results showed that the OVs-induced SnO2-x/Sb2O3 heterostructures have a very high IPA photo-oxidation catalytic degradation activity, even after six cycles with no obvious decline. Combination of defect engineering and heterojunction can be a powerful tool for obtaining broad light absorption and high photo-induced charge separation efficiency, which contributes to improving the photocatalytic IPA degradation property.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000527525600001

The presence of titanium in a low oxidation state is verified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thus confirming the existence of oxygen vacancies. Spherical aberration transmission electron microscopy studies indicate the dispersion of uniform Ru nanoparticles (average diameter: similar to 2 nm) on TiO2, and the existence of a part of Ru in the form of single atoms. The catalyst with 0.33 wt% Ru loading exhibits the best catalytic performance in the hydrolysis of NaBH4 (NaBH4 hydrolysis rate at 303 K is 60 L.min(-1).g(Ru)(-1)). Further, the catalyst performs well even after five cycles of use. (c) 12022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0925-8388	1873-4669		WOS:000779111300002

The obtained MOF is then used as a starting material for the synthesis of Co nanoparticles embedded in N,S-codoped carbon layer and supported on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (Co@NSC/MWCNTs) through the high-temperature calcination. Specifically, the calcination leads to the formation of N,S-codoped carbon-coated Co nanoparticles with simultaneous growth on the MWCNTs due to decomposition of the MOF. When used as the electrocatalyst, the Co@NSC/MWCNTs are found to have a higher activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and follow a four-electron pathway. The catalytic activity of the Co@NSC/MWCNTs is much higher than that of the pure MWCNTs and the MOFs/MWCNTs. Although the Co@NSC/MWCNTs still exhibit slightly higher overpotential for the ORR, it is indeed more kinetically facile than the commercial Pt/C catalyst, as demonstrated by its higher limiting current density and lower Tafel slope. Additionally, the Co@NSC/MWCNTs also show superior stability and better tolerance to methanol crossover and CO poisoning, compared with those of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. These results strongly suggest that the Co@NSC/MWCNTs could be used as one of the most promising ORR electrocatalysts for the ORR with great potential to replace the Pt/C. The work present here opens up a new route for the design of carbon-integrated ORR electrocatalysts with high performance from a great number of available and yet rapidly growing MOFs.									21	1	0	0	0	0	21			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000457774500039

In order to find efficient photocatalysts and electrocatalysts, materials with various composition, size, and surface/interface are investigated. In recent years, constructing suitable nanoscale hetero-interfaces can not only overcome the disadvantages of the single-phase material, but also possibly provide new functionalities. In this review, we systematically introduce the fundamental understanding and experimental progress in nanoscale hetero-interface engineering to design and fabricate photocatalytic and electrocatalytic materials for water splitting. The basic principles of photo-/electro-catalytic water splitting and the fundamentals of nanoscale hetero-interfaces are briefly introduced. The intrinsic behaviors of nanoscale hetero-interfaces on electrocatalysts and photocatalysts are summarized, which are the electronic structure modulation, space charge separation, charge/electron/mass transfer, support effect, defect effect, and synergistic effect. By highlighting the main characteristics of hetero-interfaces, the main roles of hetero-interfaces for electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting are discussed, including excellent electronic structure, efficient charge separation, lower reaction energy barriers, faster charge/electron/mass transfer, more active sites, higher conductivity, and higher stability on hetero-interfaces.

However, practical applications of g-CN in photoelectrochemical (PEC) and photoelectronic devices are still in the early stages of development due to the difficulties in fabricating high-quality g-CN layers on substrates, wide band gaps, high charge-recombination rates, and low electronic conductivity. Various fabrication and modification strategies of g-CN-based films have been reported. This review summarizes the latest progress related to the growth and modification of high-quality g-CN-based films. Furthermore, (1) the classification of synthetic pathways for the preparation of g-CN films, (2) functionalization of g-CN films at an atomic level (elemental doping) and molecular level (copolymerization), (3) modification of g-CN films with a co-catalyst, and (4) composite films fabricating, will be discussed in detail. Last but not least, this review will conclude with a summary and some invigorating viewpoints on the key challenges and future developments.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-4991		WOS:000833723400001	35889598

In the literature, there are two types of charge transfer mechanisms: (i) direct hole transfer from the valence band and (ii) indirect hole transfer via surface states. In this paper, we discuss both processes in the steady state regime through full driftdiffusion simulations considering the concomitant influence of the electric field and surface states at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. We discuss the role of surface states and valence band holes in the photo-anodic current. We subsequently analyze both hole transfer processes in a dynamic regime via the impedance spectroscopy (IS) method. We provide a solid criterion to discriminate both mechanisms and discuss some experimental examples from the literature.									78	2	0	0	5	0	78			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000371077300013

Inter-Chl tranfer of excitation energy was insensitive to the radiation inactivation indicating that the masses of CP47, CP43, and light-harvesting Chl a/b proteins are not included in the functional size of the oxygen-evolving PS II complex. The transfer of electrons from the secondary electron donor, Z, to Q(B) was catalyzed by a unit of only 65 kDa. The sizes of the complexes involved in these light-induced functions of PS II were dependent on the intensity of actinic light. Under saturating intensities of light, the functional size of the complex for transfer of electrons from Z to Q(B) was 38 kDa, with a corresponding decrease in the size of the oxygen-evolving PS II from 250 kDa to 125 kDa [Takahashi, Mano and Asada (1985) Plant Cell Physiol. 26: 383]. The protein of about 30 kDa functions in the photoreduction of the pheophytin molecule, as well as in the electron transfer from Z to Q(A). Under low-intensity light, complexes having the same sizes as those of the basal functional complexes under saturating-intensity light are further required, probably to stabilize separated charges in the PS II reaction center and the oxygen-evolving center.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6			0032-0781			WOS:A1990EP32400018

However, the construction of an active electrocatalyst with multiple sites that can promote the dissociation of water molecules still remains a great challenge. Herein, a partial-single-atom, partial-nanoparticle composite consisting of nanosized ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles (NPs) and individual Ru atoms as an energy-efficient HER catalyst in alkaline medium is reported. The formation of this unique composite mainly results from the dispersion of Ru NPs to small-size NPs and single atoms (SAs) on the Fe/N codoped carbon (Fe-N-C) substrate due to the thermodynamic stability. The optimal catalyst exhibits an outstanding HER activity with an ultralow overpotential (9 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)), a high turnover frequency (8.9 H-2 s(-1) at 50 mV overpotential), and nearly 100% Faraday efficiency, outperforming the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C and other reported HER electrocatalysts in alkaline condition. Both experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the coexistence of Ru NPs and SAs can improve the hydride coupling and water dissociation kinetics, thus synergistically enhancing alkaline hydrogen evolution performance.									52	1	0	0	7	0	52				2198-3844		WOS:000591914900001	33510999

However, the limited solubility of their discharge product, NaO2, leads to the surface-confined mechanism at high current densities, resulting in the poor energy density of Na-O-2 batteries. In this connection, a few protic phase-transfer catalysts, such as water and benzoic acid, have been examined to improve reversible capacity because they promote the solution-mediated mechanism. Herein, KO2, which is electrochemically generated from potassium trifluoromethanesulfonate dissolved in electrolytes during discharge, is introduced as a phase-transfer mediator for Na-O-2 batteries. The reaction mechanism of Na-O-2 batteries containing a KO2 mediator is clarified through ex situ XRD, cross-sectional SEM, and ICP analyses. KO2 plays the role of a phase-transfer mediator because the desolvation rate of KO2 is slower than that of NaO2. As a result, Na-O-2 batteries with KO2 show the solution-mediated mechanism rather than the surface-confined mechanism, thus delivering a high reversible capacity of approximately 6 mAh cm(-2). In addition, since KO2 is chemically and electrochemically more stable than previous protic phase-transfer mediators, Na-O-2 cells with KO2 show stable cycle performance, such as negligible capacity fading over 25 cycles.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000526331500006

The experiments show that Pb(II) haven't modified the evolution of oxygen in alkaline solutions, and the reaction taking place at 0.6 V-SCE is under the mixed control of ionic transport and charge transfer. Koutechy-Levich equation has been used to calculate the value of diffusion coefficient D and apparent heterogeneous rate constant k of Pb(II) oxidation reaction at 0.6 V-SCE. The calculation results indicate that Pb(II) itself has the negative influence on the diffusion of Pb(II). In addition, Pb(II) has the positive influence on the apparent heterogeneous rate constant of PbO2 electrodeposition process. The intermediate was discovered in PbO2 electrodeposition process using RRDE. XRD and SEM were employed to investigate the phase composition and surface microstructure of the synthesized deposit. The result confirms that PbO2 synthesized in an alkaline solution consists of pure a phase, but not all characteristic peaks are present and relative intensities are not in agreement with the ICDD card. The deposit shows the preferential orientation of growth in the (200) crystallographic plane, and the deposit is compact and uniform which is composed of rounded nanocrystallites.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1452-3981			WOS:000378559300082

It has been found that the hydrogen bond between H2SO4 and DMF molecules is a little shorter and stronger than that between H3PO4 and DMF. The H-bond strength is different both in acid-acid and (acid). DMF complexes for n = 1, 2. The polar solvent effect is taken into account by using the CPCM approach. The differences of geometric parameters of the H-bonds in the gas phase and DMF are analyzed. The potential energy surface (PES) of the proton transfer reaction in acid-DMF and (acid)(2)-DMF complexes was calculated. The calculations have shown that the gas phase PES has a single distinct minimum (with the exception of the (H2SO4)(2)-DMF). In DMF, the proton transfer reaction takes place in all complexes, if O-ACID ... O-DMF distance is constrained. The solvent effect favors a proton transfer from sulfuric acid to oxygen atom of DMF molecule and formation of stable ionic pairs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

WOC research has evolved into two major branches, namely molecular and heterogeneous catalysts. Manifold design principles and plenty of mechanistic insights have been developed in these individual fields after decades of investigations. Over the past years, a growing need for knowledge transfer between both sides has emerged in order to expedite the development and optimization of next-generation WOCs. In this review, we first provide selected recent highlights in the area of molecular WOCs with different nuclearities, together with current mechanistic insight. WOCs offering molecular integrity under operational conditions are ideal platforms for elucidating reaction mechanisms and well-defined structure-function correlations at the atomic level. Next, recent mechanistic advances and design strategies for heterogeneous WOCs are illustrated for representative examples, together with a discussion of their inherent limitations in mechanistic studies. Finally, illustrative cases of knowledge transfer between molecular and heterogeneous WOCs are discussed to highlight the advantages of combining the best of both catalyst types. For the sake of conciseness, this review focuses primarily on WOCs based on the first-row transition metals, which are attracting increasing attention for both fundamental studies and economic applications.									47	1	0	0	3	0	46			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000624298500008	33404560

The structural, morphological, and optical properties of the prepared nanocomposites are characterized by various physicochemical techniques. This synthesis process simultaneously makes the material porous, produces exfoliated sheets of g-C3N4, and disperses mixed metal oxides on the surface of g-C3N4 owing to the slow evolution of significant amount of gases such as H2O, CO2, NH3, and H2S. The dispersion of ZnO and ZnCr2O4 on the surface of the g-C3N4 exfoliated nanosheets results in a preferable resolution for visible-light-induced photocatalytic H-2 and O-2 evolution. An optimal g-C3N4 content (60%) in the ZnCr2O4@ZnO/g-C3N4 nanostructured composite results in maximum H-2 (847 mu mol in 2h) and O-2 (455 mu mol in 2h) production in the presence of CH3OH and AgNO3, respectively, as sacrificial reagents. The apparent conversion efficiencies for H-2 and O-2 evolution are 28.01 and 15.0%, respectively. The increased photocatalytic activity is attributed to the proper alignment of the band structure, synergistic effects owing to the good coordination between g-C3N4 (Lewis base) and Zn-II ions (Lewis acid), and the suppression of electron-hole recombination owing to the formation of g-C3N4 nanosheets.									53	1	0	0	9	0	53			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000410137900024

PloS one				17	1			e0261458	e0261458		10.1371/journal.pone.0261458				2022	2022	Alkaline-surfactant-polymer (ASP) flooding technology is used to maximize crude oil recovery. However, the extensive use of alkaline materials makes it difficult to treat the water used. Here, an improved multi-zone anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) using FeSO4 as electron acceptor was employed to treat the wastewater from ASP flooding technology, and the effects on major pollutants (hydrolyzed polyacrylamide, petroleum substances, surfactants suspended solids) and associated parameters (chemical oxygen demand, viscosity) were evaluated. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to follow the degradation and evolution of organic compounds while high-throughput DNA sequencing was used to determine the bacterial diversity in the ABR. The results obtained after 90 d of operation showed decreases in all parameters measured and the highest mean removal rates were obtained for petroleum substances (98.8%) and suspended solids (77.0%). Amounts of petroleum substances in the ABR effluent could meet the requirements of a national standard for oilfield reinjection water. GC-MS analysis showed that a wide range of chemicals (e.g. aromatic hydrocarbons, esters, alcohols, ketones) could be sequentially removed from the influent by each zone of ABR. The high-throughput DNA sequencing showed that the bacteria Micropruina, Saccharibacteria and Synergistaceae were involved in the degradation of pollutants in the anaerobic and anoxic reaction zones, while Rhodobacteraceae and Aliihoeflea were the main functional microorganisms in the aerobic reaction zones. The results demonstrated that the improved ABR reactor had the potential for the treatment of wastewater from ASP flooding technology.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2				1932-6203		MEDLINE:34995306	34995306

The principal aim of this work was to correlate the capability of the prepared material to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), under irradiation, with their photocatalytic activities in terms of conversion and selectivity for partial oxidation reactions. Photoelectrochemical studies revealed that MCN-TE represented the best material in terms of photoconductivity, whereas MCN-H2O2 was defective and evidenced a poor mobility of carriers. EPR studies showed a maximum generation of reactive oxygen species irradiating the MCN-TE sample. The photocatalytic activity of these materials in the selective oxidation of three different alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes, both under UV and natural solar light, showed that the highest conversion was obtained in the presence of the MCN-TE sample, whereas the most selective one was MCN-TE-H2O2. Under solar light irradiation the performances of the powders were generally better than those under UV light. The characterization of the C3N4-based materials well justified their photocatalytic activity. The pristine C3N4 materials were more active but less selective than those prepared in the presence of H2O2.					10th European Meeting on Solar Chemistry and Photocatalysis - Environmental Applications (SPEA)10th European Meeting on Solar Chemistry and Photocatalysis - Environmental Applications (SPEA)	JUN 04-08, 2018JUN 04-08, 2018	Univ AlmeriaUniv Almeria	Almeria, SPAINAlmeria, SPAIN	28	0	0	0	5	0	28			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000461462200005

The facile strategy included preparation of ZIF-8 core and ZIF-67 shell and later replacing the metal centers of ZIF with Fe ions and increasing the N content with N rich melamine. The metal and metal oxide components got captured and encapsulated in the N doped mesoporous carbon frameworks through a pyrolysis process at different temperatures. Fe, Co and CoO were trapped in the N doped mesoporous carbon networks through annealing and denoted as FCNCx. The activity and electrochemical stability of such prepared materials towards ORR and OER were tested in basic media. After analyzing rotating disk electrode studies, FCNC900 was seen to perform superior bifunctional electrocatalytic performance for both ORR and OER which was higher than Pt/C catalyst. Promising ORR performance of FCNC900 can be simply be judged from E-1/2 = 0.868 V (vs. RHE) and E-onset = 1.01 V (vs. RHE) while OER overpotential for same catalyst was 360 mV much smaller than others. Longer stability and high methanol tolerance of this catalyst was also investigated.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2196-0216			WOS:000462598900028

Spinel nanoferrites also possess the complementary benefit of facile and complete external magnet-aided recovery. Further improvement in the catalytic performance of spinel nanoferrites is currently a vibrant area of research. In this context, in the present investigation, Al has been incorporated into the lattice of spinel nanoferrites. Owing to its octahedral site preference, Al could actively participate in the reaction mechanism as octahedral sites are exposed upon the surface and catalytic activity is predominantly related to the metal ions present in these sites. Al content has varied from x = 0.2 to x = 1.0 when incorporated into the lattice of CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 as CoAlxFe2-xO4 and NiAlxFe2-xO4, respectively. Catalytic activity has been evaluated for the reduction of nitrophenols in the presence of NaBH4 as the reducing agent. The catalytic activity has been found to increase with increasing Al content up to x = 0.6, before decreasing with further increase in Al content. The effect of increasing Al content on the catalytic performance is thought to be related to synergistic interactions among the metal ions present in the surface-exposed octahedral sites.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000407304100060

Ion-permeable catalysts are found to form semiconductor-catalyst interfaces where the effective barrier height changes under operation yielding higher photovoltages and efficiencies relative to dense catalysts with the same catalytic activity. Such behavior is not captured by current equivalent circuit models, but is central to the study and design of efficient water-splitting systems.									74	2	0	0	10	0	74			0031-9007	1079-7114		WOS:000339069500019	24766026

The reaction of the manganese(II) complex with an oxidant, iodosylbenzene, produced a metastable high-valent manganese(IV)-oxo species at 0 degrees C. The high-valent Mn(IV)-oxo intermediate was characterized with a UV-vis spectrophotometer and an electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy. Reactivity studies of the Mn(IV)=O species revealed that the intermediate is capable of oxygenating PPh3 and N-dealkylating N,N-dimethyl-toludine.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1229-5949			WOS:000265240000029

The activity of HF/H2O treated silicon surfaces in ambient air before and after gate oxidation								Proceedings of the Second International Symposium on Cleaning Technology in Semiconductor Device Manufacturing								234	50						1992	1992	A strong correlation is observed among surface charge, contact angle and native oxide thickness in which, up to 10000 minutes of exposure time to ambient air, the liquid-HF/H2O and vapor-HF/H2O treated surfaces seem to undergo three distinct periods of evolution. The results indicate that the vapor-HF/H2O treatment yields surfaces with greater activity in ambient air. The trends, which are explained by considering the reaction between unpassivated trivalent silicon and hydroxyl groups, are shown to be consistent with XPS data on surface carbon, fluorine and oxygen. Following thermal oxidation, the total oxide charge, interface quality factor, oxide thickness, and contact angle are stable over time. This is attributed to the complete surface oxide coverage. The thermal oxide thicknesses of liquid-HF/H2O and vapor-HF/H2O treated surfaces are different and can be correlated to pre-oxidation surface XPS results.

Here, palladium (Pd) induced metallic (1T) MoS2 nanosheet array supported on carbon textiles (Pd-TMS/CT) was deliberately fabricated as a high-efficient freestanding cathode of Li-O-2 battery. Transforming semi-conducting 2H phase to the stabilized metallic 1T phase of MoS2 was induced by doping Pd using a spontaneous interfacial redox strategy. This novel class of 1T-MoS2 nanosheet array with unique electronic structures enables the electrode with fast reaction kinetics, high electrical transport rate, and proliferated catalytic active sites, which lead to a striking improvement of their intrinsic catalytic behavior in Li-O-2 battery. In addition, the synergistic effect with well-designed surface chemistry of MoS2 is favorable for the reversible formation and decomposition of products and the inhibition of side reactions on Pd-TMS/CT cathode. As a result, the battery with Pd-TMS/CT exhibits outstanding electrochemical behavior in terms of high discharge capacity of 7441 mA h g(-1), low overpotential, and especially the excellent electrochemical stability for over 2488 h (622 cycles). Moreover, due to its flexibility superiority, the assembled pouch-type battery based on Pd-TMS/CT cathode can stably operate in real air atmosphere under different bending and twisting conditions, which opens up a variety of potential applications of flexible devices with high energy density.									35	2	0	0	2	0	36			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000503381200152

With the discovery of graphene, two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have emerged as some of the most promising candidates for heterogeneous electrocatalysts due to their unique physical, chemical, and electronic properties. Here, we review 2D-nanomaterial-based electrocatalysts for selected electrocatalytic processes. We first discuss the unique advances in 2D electrocatalysts based on different compositions and functions followed by specific design principles. Following this overview, we discuss various 2D electrocatalysts for electrocatalytic processes involved in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle from their fundamental conception to their functional application. We place a significant emphasis on different engineering strategies for 2D nanomaterials and the influence these strategies have on intrinsic material performance, such as electronic properties and adsorption energetics. Finally, we feature the opportunities and challenges ahead for 2D nanomaterials as efficient electrocatalysts. By considering theoretical calculations, surface characterization, and electrochemical tests, we describe the fundamental relationships between electronic structure, adsorption energy, and apparent activity for a wide variety of 2D electrocatalysts with the goal of providing a better understanding of these emerging nanomaterials at the atomic level.									1119	72	0	0	53	0	1127			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000439010000008	29552883

Based on XPS analysis and the electrochemical measurements, the electrooxidation process can take place over the bared nickel surface by means of the predominant Ni(OH)(2) thin layer with formation of the Ni (OOH) as by product; the reactions were explained by a newly proposed mechanism. Later on, due to abundance of the conventional active layer, the oxidation process returns to the ordinary mechanism until exhaustion of the NiOOH layer then the oxidation reactions return back to be Ni(OH)(2)-dependent and so forth. Accordingly, it was discovered that the methanol oxidation process can be done continuously on the surface of the inactivated Ni-based materials by two successive mechanisms. Ni-decorated graphene was synthesized and exploited as an effective Ni-based electrocatalyst, the catalyst model was characterized by XRD, TEM and Raman spectroscopy analyses. Overall, the study introduces a novel characteristic for the nickel-based electrocatalysts and opens a new avenue for those cheap electrode materials to be exploited in the fuel cells.									31	1	0	0	0	0	31			0926-860X	1873-3875		WOS:000429763500014

Dichlorobenzene adsorbs weakly probably on Lewis acid sites through the chlorine atom. A very fast nucleophilic substitution on dichlorobenzene to a chlorophenate species occurs already at RT. On the contrary, adsorption of dibenzofuran is molecular, probably through the oxygen atom on Lewis sites. The aromatic rings of both molecules tend to be later oxidized to give carboxylate species. Parallel experiments with chloropropane show that dehydrochlorination occurs readily, hydrochloric acid is adsorbed quite weakly and that propene can be further oxidized. However, heavier oxidized species like cyclic anhydrides are also formed from chloropropane. The data suggest that the dechloration step of the phenyl ring could be not critical. On the contrary, the building-up of aromatic compounds from smaller molecules is possible and the oxidation of phenyl ring can be slow near reaction conditions. The possibility that the reaction between phenate species and chlorobenzenes give the "de novo" synthesis of dioxins is envisaged. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Especially, Pt alloying with Earthabundant metal can lower the cost of catalyst. Here, we introduce a one-pot approach to synthesize bimetallic PtCu and Ni-doped PtCu nanoalloy with porous structure. The as-synthesized Ni-doped Pt60Ni3Cu37 nanoalloys exhibit excellent electrocatalytic properties toward methanol oxidation in acidic medium. The mass activity of the as-synthesized Pt60Ni3Cu37 nanoalloys is 3.6 times and 5.3 times that of Pt55Cu45 nanoalloys and commercial Pt black for methanol oxidation in 0.2 M methanol solution. Besides, the stability of the as-synthesized Pt60Ni3Cu37 nanoalloys was much better than Pt55Cu45 nanoalloys and commercial Pt black. After 3600 s chronoamperometry test, the remaining values of the Pt60Ni3Cu37 nanoalloys are 3.7 times and 11.0 times that of Pt55Cu45 nanoalloys and commercial Pt black. And it is the first time to report that small amount of Ni dopants can boost the activity and stability of PtNiCu alloys toward methanol oxidation. (C) 2018 King Saud University.

Micropollutants detected in the effluent were subjected to different ozone doses related to different oxidation extents. Ozone confirmed its efficiency in terms of micropollutant reduction when applied to a municipal biotreated effluent. Accordingly, it achieved reductions exceeding 70% for 91% of the pollutants detected at high ozone dose. Organic matter transformation was also investigated by both controlling evolution of surrogates including chemical oxygen demand, dissolved organic carbon, UV254 absorbance, etc. - and the fate dissolved organic fractions by means of size exclusion chromatography followed by organic carbon detection. At ozone dose lower than the initial ozone demand of the effluent, ozone first attacked the hydrophobic aromatic compounds. At ozone dose higher than 50 mg/L, ozone probably solubilized suspended particles and principally oxidized high molecular weight molecules (> 1,000 Da) to convert them into more hydrophilic compounds. Therefore, most reactions of ozone with the micropollutants take place in competition with fast reactions of ozone with the hydrophobic fraction of the dissolved organic matter.									10	0	0	0	9	0	10			1203-8407			WOS:000288132800017

This study confirms the suggestion that a straight-line fit to the observations does not necessarily give the correct primordial He-4 abundance. This is especially true for the extrapolation of the Y versus N/H data which depends upon the relative contributions from secondary and primary nitrogen in low metallicity stars. The extrapolation of the O/H data is also slightly nonlinear even for primary oxygen in a closed-box model with instantaneous recycling due to the time dependence of the hydrogen mass fraction, the breakdown of the instantaneous recycling approximation, the production of helium, nitrogen, and oxygen in stars of different mass, and ejection of metal-poor material from low-mass stars. Our best fits to the data, even after excluding possible contamination of H n regions from neighboring Wolf-Rayet stars, gives Y(p) = 0.228 +/- 0.005 for O/H and Y(p) = 0.223 +/- 0.006 for N/H. These primordial helium abundances are as much as 2 sigma below the minimum helium abundance which can be produced in the standard homogeneous big bang model with three light neutrino flavors. This discrepancy may be due to shortcomings of the chemical evolution models, additional systematic errors in the determination of the helium and/or metal abundances in extragalactic H II regions, or effects of nonstandard primordial nucleosynthesis.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			0004-637X			WOS:A1993KG27700009

However, the scale relationships between the adsorption energies of the CO2 reduction intermediates severely restrict the catalytic performance of catalysts. Herein, we design Cu-M bimetal catalysts (BMCs) to break through the stubborn restriction of scaling relationships on catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) was used to investigate the CO2RR activity of Cu-based BMCs. It is found that the dual-atom sites (Cu site and M site) result in noteworthy deviations for the scaling relationships between COOH* and CO*. The Cu-Cr catalyst shows the best CO2RR activity towards CO production. Specifically, only a low overpotential of 0.326 V is required to enable CO2 reduction to CO. The Cu-Rh catalyst shows a good HER activity due to the lower absolute value. The electrons entering the antibonding orbital significantly increase the Pauli repulsion, which weakens the adsorption energy of atomic hydrogen on the catalysts. The d-band center (epsilon(d)) is not a good descriptor for the HER and CO2RR over BMCs. Cu-W and Cu-Mo have comparable reaction free energies of the first step involved in the HER and CO2RR processes, and are expected to be the most suitable catalysts for CO2RR-to-syngas.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000731942000001

Synthesis of such self-supported electrode still remains a big challenge due to the difficulty in the control over the 3D conducting network and the simultaneous growth of catalyst with well attachment on the conducting fibers. Herein, a self-supported Mo2C@carbon nanofibers (Mo2C@C NF) film has been successfully fabricated with outstanding electrocatalytic performance under optimized pyrolysis temperature and precursors mass ratio conditions. During the carbonation process, the Mo2C nanoparticles (similar to 16 nm) were simultaneously grown and well dispersed on the inter-connected carbon nanofibers, which formed a 3D conducting network. The as-formed 3D carbon network was strong enough to support direct electrocatalytic application without additional ink or supporting substrates. This particular electrode structure facilitated easy access to the active catalytic sites, electron transfer, and hydrogen diffusion, resulting in the high hydrogen evolution reaction activity. A low overpotential of 86 mV was needed to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) current density with outstanding kinetics metric (Tafel 43 mV dec(-1)) in 1 M KOH. Additionally, the self-supported Mo2C@C NF film, a binder-free electrode, exhibited extraordinary stability of more than 340 h.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000762037300001	35030547

The as-prepared nanostructured materials were characterized by various physico-chemical characterization techniques. Moreover, this unique synthetic approach produces 3D open porous network structure of MgCr-LDH nanoparticles, which were formed by stacking of numerous 2D nanosheets, for effective light harvestation, easy electronic channelization and unveil superlative PEC properties, including high current density (6.9 mA/cm(2)), small Tafel slope of 82 mV/decade, smallest arc of the Nyquist plot (59.1 omega cm(-2)) and photostability of 6000 s for boosting water splitting activity. In addition, such perfectly self-stacked 2D nanosheets in 3D MgCr-LDH possess more surface active defect sites as enriched 50% oxygen vacancy resulting a good contact surface within the structure for effective light absorption along with easy electron and hole separation, which facilitates the adsorption of protons and intermediate for water oxidation. Additionally, the Cr3+ as dopant pull up the electrons from water oxidation intermediates, thereby displaying superior photocatalytic H-2 and O-2 production activity of 1315 mu mol/h and 579 mu mol/h, respectively. Therefore, the open 3D morphological aspects of MgCr-LDH nanoparticles with porous network structure and high surface area possess more surface defect sites for electron channelization and identified as distinct novel features of this kind of materials for triggering significant PEC properties, along with robustly enhance the photocatalytic water splitting performances.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2045-2322			WOS:000805846400043	35661140

Pronounced asymmetries and strong dynamical interactions between shells are seen in 2D. Although instigated by turbulence, the dynamic behavior proceeds to sufficiently large amplitudes that it couples to the nuclear burning. Dramatic growth of low-order modes is seen as well as large deviations from spherical symmetry in the burning shells. The vigorous dynamics is more violent than that seen in earlier burning stages in the three-dimensional (3D) simulations of a single cell in the oxygen burning shell, or in 2D simulations not including an active Si shell. Linear perturbative analysis does not capture the chaotic behavior of turbulence (e. g., strange attractors such as that discovered by Lorenz), and therefore badly underestimates the vigor of the instability. The limitations of 1D and 2D models are discussed in detail. The 2D models, although flawed geometrically, represent a more realistic treatment of the relevant dynamics than existing 1D models, and present a dramatically different view of the stages of evolution prior to collapse. Implications for interpretation of SN1987A, abundances in young supernova remnants, pre-collapse outbursts, progenitor structure, neutron star kicks, and fallback are outlined. While 2D simulations provide new qualitative insight, fully 3D simulations are needed for a quantitative understanding of this stage of stellar evolution. The necessary properties of such simulations are delineated.									154	1	0	0	1	0	154			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000290676100005		
J	SCHMUTZLER, HJ; SANDHAGE, KH								TRANSFORMATION OF BA-AL-SI PRECURSORS TO CELSIAN BY HIGH-TEMPERATURE OXIDATION AND ANNEALING								METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS B-PROCESS METALLURGY AND MATERIALS PROCESSING SCIENCE				26	1			135	148		10.1007/BF02648986				FEB 1995	1995	Celsian (monoclinic BaO.Al2O3.2SiO(2)) is being considered as a matrix material for ceramic composites used in high-temperature structural applications. The present article describes the synthesis of celsian by the oxidation and annealing of solid, malleable, metallic Ba-Al-Si precursors. The phase and microstructural evolution after various stages of oxidation at 300 degrees C to 1260 degrees C in pure oxygen at 1 atm pressure have been examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron microprobe analyses (EPMA). Barium peroxide, BaO2, formed rapidly during oxidation at 300 degrees C, with aluminum and silicon remaining largely as unoxidized particles in a BaO2 matrix. Between 300 degrees C and 500 degrees C, barium orthosilicate, Ba2SiO4, formed by a solid-state reaction between barium peroxide and unoxidized silicon. Further exposure to temperatures between 500 degrees C and 1300 degrees C resulted in the oxidation of aluminum and of residual silicon. The oxidized silicon reacted with the barium orthosilicate matrix to yield higher silica-containing barium silicates that, in turn, reacted with alumina or mullite to form metastable hexacelsian (hexagonal BaO.Al2O3.2SiO(2)). Celsian was then obtained by further exposure to peak temperatures less than or equal to 1260 degrees C.									28	0	0	0	0	1	29			1073-5615			WOS:A1995QD55100015		
J	Song, Min; Long, Yong								Scientometric review of transition metal oxides for hydrogen energy production								ENERGY SOURCES PART A-RECOVERY UTILIZATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS				44	2			3720	3734		10.1080/15567036.2022.2069884				JUN 15 2022	2022	Hydrogen production from electrocatalytic and photo(electro)catalytic water splitting is regarded as a potential technology for clean energy production and sustainable energy storage, but the implementation is limited by the development of cost-effective and high-activity hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts. Transition metal oxides, a class of important functional materials with changeable elementary composition and crystal structures, have aroused scientists' attention for the investigation on HER. Under the circumstance, it is necessary to prepare a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of the development in this scientific area and identify the most potential materials, technologies, as well as the existing limitations and opportunities for the future commercialization. In this article, a scientometric study in the scientific area of transition metal oxides for electrocatalytic and photo(electro)catalytic HER was performed. In total, 1447 papers from Web of Science (WoS) database were extracted via the combination of relevant keywords and analyzed using various scientometric indices through Anaconda Prompt, ScientoPy, Citespace combined with Python. The investigation results indicate that the research in this field dated from 1992, and the development in this scientific area greatly accelerated from 2015. The top two types of publications in article and review share 83.8% and 13.4% of all the documents published in this area. Specifically, the most contributed countries in this field are China and United States. Journal of Materials Chemistry A is the most active journal in this scientific area. The analysis of important keywords in this research field hints that nanotechnology should be paid great attention to further promote the development of this area.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1556-7036	1556-7230		WOS:000788350500001

We investigated the physio-chemical characteristics and electrocatalytic abilities of the [Mo3S13](2-) clusters and their pyrolysis derivatives. TEM images of pyrolysis derivatives of [Mo3S13](2-) clusters indicated that some crystalline derivatives were surrounded by the amorphous derivatives at an annealing temperature of 200-270 degrees C, and some well-crystallized MoS2 with diameters of 50-100 nm were observed in the pyrolysis derivatives at 500 degrees C. Both the structure transition and the HER performance of [Mo3S13](2-) pyrolysis derivatives were mapped in terms of temperature. The atomic ratio of S:Mo significantly decreased from 3.48 to 1.89 as the annealing temperature increased, which indicated the multiple transition forms in pyrolysis derivatives. XPS, XRD, and Raman spectra also indicated the decreased density of edge sites and a poor extent of ordering in the layers of pyrolysis derivatives as the annealing temperature increased. These results corresponded well to the HER activities of the rGO/CNTs macrostructures anchored with different pyrolysis derivatives. The rGO/CNTs anchored with pyrolysis derivatives (annealed at 270 degrees C) of [Mo3S13](2-) exhibited an overpotential of similar to 178 mV (10 mA cm(-2)) with Tafel slope value located at 64.2 mV/dec, which showed relatively higher HER performances than most analogous single-metal molybdenum sulfide nanocomposites. They also exhibited a performance close to those of multimetal nanocomposites.									11	0	0	0	4	0	11			2168-0485			WOS:000431927500134

Au tips are found to grow on the apices of ZnSe NRs nonepitaxially to form an interface with no preference of orientation between Au(111) and ZnSe(001). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Au tips on ZnSe hybrid NRs gain enhanced adsorption of H compared to pristine Au, which favors the hydrogen evolution reaction. Photocatalytic tests reveal that the Au tips on ZnSe NRs effectively enhance the photocatalytic performance in hydrogen generation, in which the single Au-tipped ZnSe hybrid NRs show the highest photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of 437.8 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) in comparison with a rate of 51.5 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) for pristine ZnSe NRs. An apparent quantum efficiency of 1.3% for hydrogen evolution reaction for single Au-tipped ZnSe hybrid NRs is obtained, showing the potential application of this type of cadmium (Cd)-free metal-semiconductor hybrid nanoparticles (NPs) in solar hydrogen production. This work opens an avenue toward Cd-free hybrid NP-based photocatalysis for clean fuel production.									31	3	0	0	1	0	31			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000498908100001	31769587

Measurements have been made in the open-circuit potential using aqueous solutions with KOH concentrations in the range 1.0-6.0 mol dm(-3) and HO2- concentrations up 50 mmol dm(-3) at 25.0degreesC. Under these conditions, the system is controlled by activation, the charge-transfer resistance being much higher than ohmic, adsorption, and diffusion resistive elements. The double-layer capacities show that the wetted electroactive areas, much smaller than the total area, depend on the KOH concentration used for activation. True exchange current densities of about 1 muA cm 22 are obtained, while their apparent values are two orders of magnitude greater, since the sluggish reaction is compensated by the high electroactive area. The cathodic process is a first-order reaction with respect to the O-2 feed, and independent of HO2- and OH- concentrations. For the anodic one, a zero order for O-2 and a first order for HO2- and OH- are calculated. These results agree with the previously proposed mechanism for the O-2 reduction to HO2- on the same electrode from voltammetric studies. Indirect evidence on a weak adsorption of HO2- is found from the impedance diagrams. (C) 2002 The Electrochemical Society.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000180069000045

The PEC potential of the electrocatalyst depends on the chemical oxidation state of forming elements, which may strongly vary under the photoinduced charge flow. However, element-sensitive, real-time measurements of the oxidation state of the electrocatalyst are not generally possible using conventional X-ray absorption techniques. Here, we show that fixed-energy X-ray absorption voltammetry and chronoamperometry, which measure the X-ray absorption coefficient variations along with photocurrent, can follow in real time the redox kinetics of electrocatalysts. To demonstrate the validity, we investigate hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) photoanodes covered with a nickel hydroxide electrocatalyst and show that it is fully oxidized by photogenerated holes to nickel oxyhydroxide with Ni reaching a higher oxidation state (Ni-IV) than that observed under electrocatalytic oxygen evolution in dark conditions. Highly oxidized Ni results from charge accumulation in the overlayer and can be observed only in the case of thick layers (with low PEC performance). On the other hand, the average oxidation state of Ni reaches lower values, under operative conditions, for very thin layers, resulting in high PEC activity. We complete our study by presenting PEC activity and impedance spectroscopy analysis using different thicknesses of the electrocatalyst, thus giving a detailed picture of the multiple and complex charge transfer processes occurring at a semiconductor/electrocatalyst junction.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200017

Toward this goal, we report on the nanocasting synthesis of a three-dimensionally (3D) mesoporous CoP/CoCr2O4 heterojunction as efficient bifunctional electrodes for use in overall water splitting in alkaline media. The phosphorization of mesoporous CoCr2O4 nanocast from a KIT-6 hard silica template leads to phase transformation and separation, spontaneously forming a heterojunction between CoP and spine] CoCr2O4 with attractive nanostructured properties (large surface area of 83 m2/g with 4.8 nm diameter accessible mesopores). This phosphide-spinel oxide heterojunction catalyst yields excellent catalytic activity for both OER and HER with overpotentials of only 290 and 212 mV, respectively, to achieve the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Moreover, CoP/CoCr2O4 shows small Tafel slopes with outstanding durability and long-life stability in alkaline media. Finally, the bifunctionality of CoP/CoCr2O4 for both OER and HER was shown by producing symmetric electrodes in an alkaline water electrolyzer, resulting in a low cell voltage of 1.68 V with 24 h durability, making it among the best Co-based electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. Such bifunctionality suggests a cost-effective heterojunction-based system for water electrolysis using inexpensive earth-abundant metals. The simple route to achieving an effective bifunctional material, which can be applied to various transition-metal-based homo- or heterojunctions, offers a paradigm for templated bifunctional electrode materials.									26	1	0	0	1	0	26			2574-0962			WOS:000516665300050

However, such metal catalyst surfaces also serve as recombination sites for H-2 and O-2, forming H2O. We herein report the photon-induced fabrication of microporous SiO2 membranes that can selectively restrict passage of O-2 and larger hydrated ions while allowing penetration of protons, water, and H-2. The SiO2 layers were selectively photodeposited on Pt nanoparticles on SrTiO3 photocatalyst by using tetramethylammonium (TMA) as a structure-directing agent (SDA), resulting in the formation of core shell Pt@SiO2 cocatalysts. The resulting photocatalyst exhibited both improved overall water splitting performance under irradiation and with no H-2/O-2 recombination in the dark. The function of the SiO2 layers was investigated electrochemically by fabricating the SiO2 layers on a Pt electrode via an analogous cathodic deposition protocol. The uniform, dense, yet amorphous layers possess microporosity originating from ring structures formed during the hydrolysis of the silicate precursor in the presence of TMA, suggesting a double-role for TMA in coordinating silicate to cathodic surfaces and in creating a microporous material. The resulting layers were able to function as a molecular sieve, allowing for exclusive H-2 generation while excluding unwanted side reactions by O-2 or ferricyanide. The SiO2 layer is stable for extended periods of time in photocatalytic conditions, demonstrating promise as a nontoxic material for selective H-2 evolution.									27	1	0	0	1	0	27			2155-5435			WOS:000414724700066

Recently, great importance has been attached to metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived carbon-based materials due to the low cost and excellent performance. Herein, a novel zeolitic imidazole framework (ZnFe-ZIF) with a unique 3D flower-like morphology is synthesized in an aqueous solution, and then directly converted into Fe, N-codoped carbon frameworks with carbon nanotubes by a one-step pyrolysis process, which inherits the structure of the precursor. By virtue of advantageous structural features, sufficient active sites (especially efficient FeNx moieties), the as-obtained electrocatalyst possesses superior ORR performance in alkaline media with a half-wave potential of 0.89 V outperforming that of commercial Pt/C (0.84 V), and good approaching activity to Pt/C (0.78 V) in acidic media. In addition, it exhibits better stability and methanol/CO resistance than those of commercial Pt/C under both alkaline and acidic conditions. Moreover, the primary zinc-air battery using this electrocatalyst delivers a maximum power density of 131.7 mW cm(-2), and a high specific capacity of 720 mAh g(-1) and energy density of 880 Wh kg(-1) at 20 mA cm(-2).

However, effective approaches to precisely control heteroatom co-doping to guide catalytic activities are still lacking. Herein, a P and N-coordinated fullerene-like carbon (N,P-FC) multi-functional catalyst was constructed via a facile soft-template pyrolysis method, which achieves impressive activity for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO (CO2RR, 83.3% faradaic efficiency for CO (FECO), a high current density of similar to 24 mA cm(-2) at -0.8 V), along with high selectivity and long-term stability. The activity of N,P-FC for CO2RR is strongly dependent on the P/N atomic ratio. Also, N,P-FC possesses an impressive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance with a half-wave overpotential (E-1/2) of 0.910 V, 79 mV higher than that of commercial Pt/C, and it outperforms all documented carbon-based electrocatalysts. Combined theoretical calculation studies suggest that the P-coordinated C site is more active for CO2RR, while the N-coordinated neighboring C site is responsible for ORR in this catalyst. This work highlights a new concept for modulating surface charge redistribution by heteroatom co-doping and morphology control toward designing efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts.									67	10	0	0	3	0	68			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000473054500030

This is achieved by a careful control of the plating bath composition during the electrolysis. The resulting coatings show a multilayer structure and the desirable concentration profile for all the metallic species involved, as revealed by SEM and EDX analyses. The electrochemical active area of the deposits after leaching of the zinc was measured by cyclic voltammetry. They were of the order of 1100 and 4400 times the geometric area for Ni and Ni-Co, respectively. These highly porous structures are very active for hydrogen evolution in alkaline solutions, showing extremely low overpotentials for relatively high current densities, as well as good stability for long term operation. Other possible applications for these structures are briefly discussed.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			0021-891X			WOS:A1996UH86200009

Herein, under the guidance of DFT calculation results, a facile and effective strategy for synthesizing noble metal-free catalysts is used to construct heteroatoms co-doped carbon catalyst. The N, P, S tri-doped hollow carbon nanospheres (NPSCSs) are synthesized via template-induced polymer-derived strategy and carbonizationetching-carbonization process. The obtained NPSCSs display special hollow structure with large specific surface area of 1154.89 m(2)g(-1). As expect, NPSCSs as bifunctional oxygen catalyst exhibit high-performance electrocatalytic activity. More attractively, as the cathode catalysts of assembled the Zn-air batteries (ZABs), NPSCSs show high maximum power density and long cycle stability. This strategy providing a new way to obtain multiheteroatoms-doped electrocatalysts with excellent electrocatalytic activity and cycling stability.									27	2	0	0	1	0	28			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000472709100006

To unravel the mechanism of heterogeneous oxidation in the cellulose condensed phase, the real-time evolution of functional groups in cellulose char during oxidative pyrolysis was probed by the in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform technology, which is further analyzed by a homemade semi-quantitative analysis program based on the perturbation-correlation moving-window twodimensional correlation spectroscopy and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy. The experimental results show the obvious promotion effects of O2 on the direct oxidation of hydroxyls to unconjugated C--O and the cleavage of C-O-C in the development stage between the temperatures of the initiation and the maximum rate of weight loss, resulting in the lowered thermostability and devolatilization of cellulose. At elevated temperatures, the hydroxyls and C--O were further oxidized by O2 into carboxyls, and released at around 450 degrees C in the last decline stage, performing the second peak of the derivative thermogravimetry curve for oxidative pyrolysis. Through density functional theory calculation of the hydroxyl oxidation, a low-temperature oxidation mechanism competitive with the transglycosylation and other dehydration reactions was proposed. Its rate is determined by the initiating H abstraction, which highly depends on the spin density (population) for the transition state and pyrolysis temperature.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000861333100005

Using a standard LP30 lithium ion battery electrolyte as well as 1.0 M LiPF6 in either ethylene carbonate (EC) or dimethyl carbonate (DMC), respectively, the gas evolution rates during potentiodynamic cycling and in potential step experiments were monitored online, with high time resolution, in half-cell measurements. Following the potential and time dependent appearance of the reaction products and their fragments, the major gases evolved were identified as H-2, CO2 and CO. Their formation at the LNMO electrode at high potentials is explained by Ni4+ catalyzed dehydrogenation of organic carbonates, as evidenced in the potential step experiments from the correlation of the charge passed and the continuous gas formation even after decay of current down to zero. Differences in the potential dependent and in the time dependent product formation rates in the three electrolytes point to a non-additive behavior of the solvents EC and DMC in LP30. The results clearly illustrate the potential of this set-up for detailed studies of electrolyte degradation processes in modern battery systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been concluded that their electrocatalytic effects for the hydrogen evolution reaction (h.e.r.) rank in the following order: Ni-Mo-Fe > Ni-Mo-Cu > Ni-Mo-Zn > Ni-Mo-Co approximately Ni-Mo-W > Ni-Mo-Cr > Ni-plated steel. Further investigations on these electrocatalysts have revealed that the cathodic overpotential contribution to the electrolysis voltage can be brought down by 0.3 V when compared with conventional steel cathodes. The best and most stable hydrogen evolving cathode of these, namely Ni-Mo-Fe, exhibited an overpotential of about 0. 187 V for over 1500 h of continuous electrolysis in 6 M KOH at 300 mA cm-2 and 353 K. The salient features of the codeposits, such as physical characteristics, chemical composition, current-potential behaviour and the varying effects of the catalytic activation method were analysed with a view to correlating the micro-structural characteristics of the coatings with the hydrogen adsorption process. The stability under open circuit conditions, the tolerance to electrochemical corrosion and the long term stability of Ni-Mo-Fe codeposit cathodes were very encouraging. An attempt to identify the pathway for the h.e.r. on these codeposit cathodes was made, in view of the electrochemical parameters obtained experimentally.									90	8	0	0	1	0	93			0021-891X			WOS:A1992HR87500011

Previously, we have investigated all 26 potentially tetravalent dopants for efficient thermochemical splitting of CO2. Here, we fine-tune the dopant activity (x = 0.10 Zr4+, 0.10 Hf4+, 0.07 Ta5+, and 0.05 Nb5+) of all thermally stable ceria materials with an oxygen exchange capacity (OEC) surpassing that of pristine ceria (CeO2-delta), and we employ thermogravimetric analysis to evaluate long-term stability of their OEC over 50 consecutive redox cycles. Each cycle swings between 40 min ceria oxidation with approximately 500 mbar CO2 at 1000 degrees C and 90 min ceria reduction in about 0.01 mbar O-2 at 1500 degrees C. Along with analyses of phase purity and stability (PXRD), of composition and dopant concentration (EDX and ICP-MS), and of sintering via SEM, the cycling results show long-term stable OEC and kinetics of the oxygen exchange for Zr-, Hf-, and Nb-doped ceria, despite their distinctly sintered particle surfaces. This attractive performance is rationalized by characterizing oxidation states and oxygen vacancies and by excluding surface carbonation through Raman and FT-IR spectroscopy. Furthermore, we find that introducing stable oxygen vacancies in Ce0.95Hf0.05O2-delta by doping with additional 5% lower-valent Li+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Y3+, and Er3+ does not significantly accelerate the oxygen exchange kinetics. From this first comprehensive long-term stability study of systematically optimized ceria, we propose ceria co-doped with permutations of Hf4+, Zr4+, and Nb5+, yielding an optimal average dopant radius of 0.8 angstrom, as the benchmark redox material for thermochemical production of solar fuels.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000431506600039

Herein, we successfully constructed unique bifunctional CoN3 catalytic sites atomically dispersed on N-doped graphitic carbon nanosheets (CoSA/NCs), which enable Zn-air batteries with ultrahigh durability for over 6000 cycles (~ 2000 h). The 2D carbon construction and single-atom Co formation were achieved simultaneously in salt-assisted process employing CoCl2. CoCl2 serves as a recyclable template, a pore -making agent, and a catalyst for graphitization, which effectively enables the catalyst with abundant active sites catalyze ORR and OER. Our experimental and theoretical modeling results confirm that of CoN3 surpasses CoN4 in term of the ORR and OER catalytic activity. The Zn-air battery based on CoSA/NCs catalyst exhibits a high peak power density of 255 mW cm(-2). With unparalleled catalytic performance and low production cost, this catalyst paves the way for the potential large-scale application of Zn-air batteries.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000827134800003

Hemocyanin and hemocyanin-derived peptides have been linked to key aspects of innate immunity. In the present study, the full-length cDNA encoding hemocyanin in Sepiella maindroni (SmHc) was cloned and characterized. Bioinformatic analysis predicted that SmHc contains one open reading frame of 10,032 bp and encodes a polypeptide of 3343 amino acids. Sequence analysis showed that the predicted protein sequence of SmHc contained eight functional units (FUs). Phylogenic analysis revealed that SmHc clustered with the mollusc Hcs. Quantitative real-time PCR assay detected SmHc transcripts were in a wide range of tissues, but mainly distributed in gills. After hypoxia or bacterial challenge, the expression level of SmHc in the gills was significantly higher than that of the control group. These results suggested that SmHc might play important roles in oxygen transport and the modulation of immune response in S. maindroni. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicate that ultrafast electron-proton transfer from physisorbed water to the photohole initiates the photo-oxidation on the S-1 potential energy surface. The new mechanism readily explains the observation of mobile hydroxyl radicals in recent experiments. Two key driving forces for the photo-oxidation reaction are identified: localization of the electron-hole pair and stabilization of the photohole by hydrogen bonding interaction. Our findings illustrate the scope of recent advances in NAMD methods and emphasize the importance of explicit simulation of electronic excitations.									49	0	0	0	5	0	49			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000395906900062	28507672

The activity of these anodes was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (10 mV/s) and the stability was determined by chronopotentiometry (2.5 mA/cm2) in 1M H2SO4. The oxidation of 2-propanol was examined as a simple electroorganic model reaction. The quality of a first category of mixed oxides with general composition MnMe2O4 decreased in the order Me = Co, Ni, Fe. In a second group with the general formula MeMn2O4 a decrease in the order Me = Co, Cu, Fe, Ni, Ti, Zn, Cd, Ca, Mg, (Zn, Ge), Li was observed. The corresponding candidates of the second group were superior to those of the first. The anode service life tau of the optimum spinel anode CoMn2O4/Ti is dependent on the current density, according to j(lambda) tau = const. (lambda = 1.7). Thus high current densities are precluded. The mechanism has been discussed in terms of a heterogeneous redox catalysis: surface Mn(VII) states are formed in a slow electrochemical step. In a subsequent fast chemical oxidation of the organic molecule the original reduced state is regenerated. This also explains the comparatively good service life of these anodes.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			0930-7516			WOS:A1994PM32800007

The transformation of crystal structure from anatase to rutile was observed at T(c) almost-equal-to 873 K along with a drastic decrease in specific surface area. This led to a decrease in the amount of both surface hydroxyls and Ag+ adsorbed ([Ag+]ad) from an aqueous silver nitrate solution. For each powder, [Ag+]ad increased with pH of the suspension. Deposition of silver metal onto the TiO2 surface and evolution of molecular oxygen (O2) were observed by photoirradiation (at greater than 300 nm) on TiO2 suspended in a silver sulfate solution at room temperature. The overall stoichiometry of [4Ag+ + 2H2O = 4Ag + O2 + 4H+] was obtained from the results of irradiation of 1 h for each TiO2 powder. The initial rate of this photocatalytic reaction was evaluated from the amount of photodeposited silver during several photoirradiation durations of less than 5 min, and compared with [Ag+]ad. The lower photocatalytic activity of TiO2 of lower T(c), despite larger [Ag+]ad, was caused by the significant surface recombination of photoexcited electrons and positive holes, depressing the substantial rate of reduction of adsorbed Ag+.									65	3	1	0	6	0	68			1010-6030			WOS:A1992HM82100009

The thermal analysis of the reduction-nitridation of FeTiO3 powders is conducted by thermogravimetry/differential scanning calorimeter. The phase transition sequence of microwave carbothermal synthesis of TiN-Fe composite is: FeTiO3 -> Fe + TiO2 -> Fe + TiN. There is no any other oxygen-deficient titanium oxides detected. Particularly, FeTiO3 can be transformed into TiN-Fe composite completely at 900 degrees C for 60min by microwave heating. The increase in both the reaction temperature and dwelling time is in favour of the transformation of FeTiO3. The product morphologies are spherical about 2-5m in size. Then TiN is obtained with the removal of Fe and their oxides from TiN-Fe composite by acid leaching treatment. This method not only reduces the reaction temperature significantly through microwave heating but also can simplify the operation process effectively.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			1743-6753	1743-6761		WOS:000409214700008

However, the undesirable NH3 yield rate and Faraday efficiency make it a challenge to characterize and evaluate the performance of eNRR catalysts, which severely hinders the development of the eNRR in both the research field and industry applications. Recently, the precise detection protocols towards the produced NH3 from the eNRR, such as control measurements and quantitative isotope measurements, have made it possible to scientifically analyze the accurate catalytic performance. By virtue of the gradually developed detection strategies, atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADMCs) with high atomic utilization efficiency and unique electronic structures, have been recognized as promising catalysts to enhance eNRR performance. Herein, the current breakthroughs in designing ADMCs for the eNRR are summarized, which are necessary for the further development of the eNRR and ADMCs. In this review, firstly, the fundamental principles of the eNRR are presented to illustrate the evaluation criterion of eNRR performance and catalytic mechanisms. Secondly, the construction of ADMCs for the eNRR from both experimental and theoretical points of view is systematically summarized. Thirdly, the current progress with outstanding ADMCs in the eNRR is emphasized. Finally, the perspectives are discussed for constructing high-performance ADMCs in the eNRR.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000870783700001

Herein, we demonstrate a new kind of coordinately unsaturated manganese-based metal-organic framework (MOF) as an advanced cathode for ZIBs. Coordination unsaturation of Mn is performed with oxygen atoms of two adjacent -COO-. Its proper unsaturated coordination degree guarantees the high-efficiency Zn2+ transport and electron exchange, thereby ensuring high intrinsic activity and fast electrochemical reaction kinetics during repeated charging/discharging processes. Consequently, this MOF-based electrode possesses a high capacity of 138 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) and a long life span (93.5% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 3000 mA g(-1)) due to the above advantages. Such distinct Zn2+ ion storage performance surpasses those of most of the recently reported MOF cathodes. This concept of adjusting the coordination degree to tune the energy storage capability provides new avenues for exploring high-performance MOF cathodes in aqueous ZIBs.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000683741400055	34297523	
J	Yamamoto, Yasusi				Yamamoto, Yasusi/B-2637-2011				Quality Control of Photosystem II: The Mechanisms for Avoidance and Tolerance of Light and Heat Stresses are Closely Linked to Membrane Fluidity of the Thylakoids								FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE				7						1136	10.3389/fpls.2016.01136				AUG 2 2016	2016	When oxygenic photosynthetic organisms are exposed to excessive light and/or heat, Photosystem II is damaged and electron transport is blocked. In these events, reactive oxygen species, endogenous radicals and lipid peroxidation products generated by photochemical reaction and/or heat cause the damage. Regarding light stress, plants first dissipate excessive light energy captured by light-harvesting chlorophyll protein complexes as heat to avoid the hazards, but once light stress is unavoidable, they tolerate the stress by concentrating damage in a particular protein in photosystem II, i.e., the reaction center binding D1 protein of Photosystem II. The damaged D1 is removed by specific proteases and replaced with a new copy produced through de novo synthesis (reversible photoinhibition). When light intensity becomes extremely high, irreversible aggregation of D1 occurs and thereby D1 turnover is prevented. Once the aggregated products accumulate in Photosystem II complexes, removal of them by proteases is difficult, and irreversible inhibition of Photosystem II takes place (irreversible photoinhibition). Important is that various aspects of both the reversible and irreversible photoinhibition are highly dependent on the membrane fluidity of the thylakoids. Heat stress-induced inactivation of photosystem II is an irreversible process, which may be also affected by the fluidity of the thylakoid membranes. Here I describe why the membrane fluidity is a key to regulate the avoidance and tolerance of Photosystem II on environmental stresses.									63	1	0	0	53	0	64			1664-462X			WOS:000380892800001	27532009

We work towards resolving this issue by developing in situ variable temperature Raman spectroscopy as a means to better understand the formation of alpha-Fe2O3, using the conversion of gamma-FeOOH to alpha-Fe2O3 under varied gaseous environments as a model case. The sensitivity of Raman spectroscopy to structural changes provides mechanistic insights that are not readily available in more conventional approaches, such as thermal gravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. The Raman spectra are combined with conventional thermal analyses to interpret the photoelectrocatalytic performance of a series of alpha-Fe2O3 photoanodes prepared by systematic variation of a three-stage annealing protocol. The combined results suggest that protohematite, a form of alpha-Fe2O3 where trapped hydroxyl ligands are balanced by Fe(III) vacancies, forms between 200 degrees C and 400 degrees C in a reaction environment-dependent fashion. This protohematite is shown to be remarkably persistent once formed, degrading photoelectrocatalytic performance. This research advances understanding of the gamma-FeOOH to alpha-Fe2O3 structural transformation, illustrates a powerful method to study solid state phase transitions, and provides guidance for the synthesis of high quality alpha-Fe2O3 from a convenient precursor.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2515-7655			WOS:000685896800001		
J	Hoenigsberg, H. F.								From geochemistry and biochemistry to prebiotic evolution ... we necessarily enter into Ganti's fluid automata								GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH				6	2			358	373						2007	2007	The present study is just an overview of the opening of the geochemical stage for the appearance of life. But that opening would not have been sufficient for the intellectual discovery of the origin of life! The excellent works and many commendable efforts that advance this explanation have not shown the fundamental elements that participate in the theoretical frame of biological evolution. The latter imply the existence of evolutionary transitions and the production of new levels of organization. In this brief analysis we do not intend to introduce the audience to the philosophy of biology. But we do expect to provide a modest overview, in which the geochemical chemolithoautotrophic opening of the stage should be seen, at most, as the initial metabolism that enabled organic compounds to follow the road where a chemical fluid machinery was thus able to undertake the more '' sublime '' course of organic biological evolution. We think that Tibor Ganti's chemoton is the most significant contribution to theoretical biology, and the only course now available to comprehend the unit of evolution problem without the structuralist and functionalist conflict prevalent in theoretical biology. In our opinion Ganti's chemoton theory travels to the '' locus '' where evolutionary theory dares to extend itself to entities at many levels of structural organization, beyond the gene or the group above. Therefore, in this and subsequent papers on the prebiotic conditions for the eventual appearance of the genetic code, we explore the formation and the presence of metal sulfide minerals, from the assembly of metal sulfide clusters through the precipitation of nanocrystals and the further reactions resulting in bulk metal sulfide phases. We endeavor to characterize pristine reactions and the modern surfaces, utilizing traditional surface science techniques and computational methods. Moreover, mechanistic details of the overall oxidation of metal sulfide minerals are set forth. We hope that this paper will lead our audience to accept that in a chemically oscillating system the chemoton is a model fluid state automaton capable of growth and self-reproduction. This is not simply a matter of transmitting a pattern, as in inorganic crystals; such self-reproduction must be more complex than crystal growth. Indeed that is what Ganti's theoretical and abstract model offers to us all: we finally have a philosophy of evolutionary units in theoretical biology.									2	0	0	0	3	0	3			1676-5680			WOS:000251696400014	17624859

The kinetics and thermodynamics of redox reactions are important factors that determine hydrogen production efficiency. This efficiency is strongly influenced by the structural properties of active materials used in II-TWS reactions. Perovskite oxides are one of the promising active materials for II-TWS due to their superior oxygen exchange abilities. In this study, La1-xCaxMn0.8Co0.2O3 (LCMC) type perovskites with a wide range of calcium substitution (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8) were examined for hydrogen production in terms of their structural properties, kinetics, O-2/H-2 production capacities, and cyclabilities. According to our test results, La0.8Ca0.2Mn0.8Co0.2O3 (LCMC8282) and La0.6Ca0.4Mn0.8Co0.2O3 (LCMC6482) displayed higher H-2 production capacity with 256 mu mol g(-1) and 88 mu mol g(-1) as compared to the other selected perovskites. After three consecutive cycles, La0.8Ca0.2Mn0.8Co0.2O3 lost 83% of its H-2 production capacity whereas La0.6Ca0.4Mn0.8Co0.2O3 preserved 61% of its H-2 production capacity achieved in the first cycle.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1047-4838	1543-1851		WOS:000857954400004

However, the stability of Pd is known to be limited, yet still not fully understood. In this work, Pd dissolution is studied in acidic media using an online inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in combination with an electrochemical scanning flow cell (SFC). Crucial parameters influencing dissolution like potential scan rate, upper potential limit (UPL) and electrolyte composition are studied on a bulk polycrystalline Pd (poly -Pd). Furthermore, a comparison with a supported high -surface area catalyst is carried out for its potential use in industrial applications. For this aim, a carbon supported Pd nanocatalyst (Pd/C) is synthesized and its performance is compared with that of bulk poly -Pd. Our results evidence that the transient dissolution is promoted by three main contributions (one anodic and two cathodic). At potentials below 1.5 VRHE the anodic dissolution is the dominating mechanism, whereas at higher potentials the cathodic mechanisms prevail. On the basis of the obtained results, a model is thereafter proposed to explain the transient Pd dissolution.(C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Boron-doped diamond (BDD), mixed metal oxide (MMO) and platinum (Pt) used as anode materials were examined with Na2SO4 and NaCI as supporting electrolytes. Analysis of result showed that AO II degradation efficiency was strongly linked to the anode-electrolyte-current interaction. The differing performances recorded in these anode/electrolyte systems could be explained in terms of oxygen evolution over-potential and electro-generated oxidants, and BDD/NaCI system outperformed other systems in terms of decolorization and mineralization efficiency. Further kinetic study indicated that the electrochemical degradation of AO II might follow different reaction orders, depending on the anode material and supporting electrolytes adopted. As a consequence, the new results recorded above were mainly consistent with the low electrolyte concentrations employed (1.0 similar to 10.0 mM). Thus, we highlighted the importance of operating level selections in anodic oxidation processes, especially when different concentrations of supporting electrolytes were present in the reaction system.

Especially, the catalytic properties of materials may change dramatically when the macroscopic size of matter goes from bulk to nanometer to atomic level. It is very firmly believed that "Small size determines macroproperties, contains big science." Therefore, as chemists hope, it is very essential to rationally tune and characterize the size of materials and deeply understand the relationship between macroscopic catalytic properties and small structures. Herein, the recent progress in both multi-scale materials from nanoscale, sub-nano, clusters to atomic scale for various catalytic reactions is focused. Specifically, the catalytic reaction on the microstructures and the relationship between the small scale and big science are comprehensively summarized and discussed. This review systematically spans dimensions to reveal the catalytic performances of materials at different scales with a unique effect. This is crucial for rationally understanding the composition of materials and exploring their catalytic activity. Current opportunities, future challenges, and outlooks for the application of multiscale materials (NMs, sub-nano, cluster, and atomically dispersed materials) in catalysis, energy and environmental protection, etc. are summarized and outlined.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2688-4046			WOS:000867300700001

Generally, cobalt incorporation led to higher activities for the alcohol oxidation (AOR) compared to the Cu-only material and the results are compared with the competing oxygen evolution reaction (OER). On the Cu-Co hydroxycarbonates, the electrooxidation of vicinal alcohols such as glycerol and ethylene glycol requires lower overpotentials than EOR and OER. Cu leaching from the hydroxycarbonate structure was observed in the presence of vicinal alcohols. The impact of chemical and electrochemical leaching of copper from the catalysts has been studied. The chemically leached catalyst was found to show increased AOR activity compared to other hydroxycarbonates, enabling the formation of larger amounts of formic acid during GOR measured in a circular flow cell electrolyzer. The results highlight that Cu-Co hydroxycarbonates can be used as precursors to generate electrocatalytically active materials from Cu-Co hydroxycarbonates for the AOR in alkaline solution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000809272700001

The bottleneck of HDO is the formation of deactivating carbonaceous species on the catalyst surface. In this work, we have studied the deactivation pathways of catalysts based on noble metal nanoparticles (Pt-Pd) supported on mildly acid supports during the HDO of raw bio-oil. At conditions of accelerated deactivation, monitoring the evolution with time on stream of hydrocarbon and oxygenated compounds in the reaction medium, the intermediates on the catalyst surface and the nature-location of deactivating species, two parallel deactivation routes have been revealed: the deposition of (i) thermal or pyrolytic lignin from alkylmethoxy phenols, on the catalyst mesopores and favored at low temperature, and; of (ii) aromatic coke from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, starting on the catalyst micropores through condensation reactions and promoted by acidic sites and high temperature. Nevertheless, catalyst deactivation can be controlled within limits at harsh temperature conditions (450 degrees C) due to the preferential HDO of alkyl(methoxy) phenols into aromatics and the formation-hydrocracking steady state of the aromatic precursors of coke.									56	1	0	0	6	0	56			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000446283800052

Part 1: Pyrolysis Char Structure and Reactivity								ENERGY & FUELS				34	4			4243	4250		10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c00032				APR 16 2020	2020	CO2 and H2O have great influence on pyrolysis char structure and its reactivity. Particularly, the effect of CO2 and H2O on pyrolysis char kinetic parameters are unrevealed. Char structure and the corresponding combustion kinetic parameters play a very important role for designing and modeling oxy-fuel combustion. This work focuses on the effects of CO2 and H2O on pyrolysis gas, coal burnout degree, char structure, and corresponding combustion kinetic parameters. The volatile compositions were measured by gas chromatography. Coal burnout degree, char structure, and reactivity were measured by a drop tube furnace, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetric anaylsis, respectively. Our results indicate that a H2O-containing atmosphere results in decreasing char yield, developed and disordered char structure, and high reaction rate constant. All of these features are more obvious in a H2O-containing atmosphere than in a CO2-containing atmosphere. Moreover, a H2O-containing atmosphere reduces char-O-2 reaction rate, as well as coal burnout degree in a low oxygen atmosphere at early and middle combustion stages (i.e., burnout degree <80%), but increases at the end stage of combustion (i.e., burnout degree >80%). Our investigation will give basic kinetic parameters and features of char properties obtained in CO2 and H2O atmospheres.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000526324100025

Here, we present hydrothermally synthesized copper telluride nanowires (Cu7Te4-NW) for high activity water oxidation. The successful synthesis of nanoscale catalytic material is characterized through various techniques. The electrocatalyst exhibits the higher intrinsic catalytic performance at very low overpotentials (277 mV), smaller Tafel slope (33 mV dec(-1)), least charge transfer resistance (1.5 Omega), higher turnover frequency value (2.57 s(-1) @ 350 mV), and long-term durability (100 mA for 24 h @ 1.66 V vs RHE), surpassing the electrocatalytic efficiency for Oxides of noble metals i.e. Ru and Ir. DFT calculations demonstrate that the energy for hydroxyl attachment is highly favourable onto the porous substrate of Cu7Te4-NW, further approving its remarkable properties for heightened electrocatalytic water oxidation performance. The highly atypical OER catalytic performance is discovered for Cu7Te4-CF that can be succinctly attributed to its extraordinary structural attributes yielding greater surface area and highly exposed catalytic active sites. The novel catalyst of Cu7Te4-CF can be bench-marked as an alternative for previously scrutinized metal chalcogenides based electrocatalysts for OER due to its efficacious catalytic performance.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000760947000003

The core-shell nanoparticle, which comprises a thin layer of catalytically active shell over a subsurface core, represents an important class of electrocatalysts. Although the internal core does not participate directly in catalysis, it influences the properties of the shell in terms of activity and stability. Furthermore, the usage of platinum-group metals (PGMs) can be greatly reduced when earth-abundant elements serve as the core materials. Thanks to these advantages, core-shell nanoparticles have attracted ever-increasing research interest. In this Perspective, we focus on recent advances of core-shell electrocatalysts constituted by earth-abundant cores and noble-metal shells. We start by discussing the factors that can influence the electrocatalytic properties of core-shell nanoparticles and move on to briefly summarize their synthetic strategies. We further discuss the core-shell electrocatalysts in terms of different core materials (low-PGM alloys, nonprecious metals, nitrides, carbides, and oxides) and showcase their electrocatalytic properties in reactions involved in water electrolysis and fuel cells. We conclude by discussing the general trends and challenges in this field.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300007

In addition to traditional removal methods, nitric oxide can be removed by the electrochemical reduction method. In this study, Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta powders were synthesized using a solid-state reaction method. Symmetrical cells, with Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 as the electrolyte and Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta as the electrodes, were prepared as the electrochemical reactor for nitric oxide reduction. In the process of electrochemical reduction, nitric oxide reduction occurs at the cathode and oxygen evolution occurs at the anode. To study the nitric oxide reduction performance of the electrode, impedances of the symmetrical cell in different atmospheres were analyzed. For the nitric oxide conversion in symmetric cells, two different modes, dual chamber and single chamber, were applied. Results demonstrated that the denitrification performance of the double chamber was better but the single chamber mode had other advantages in its simple structure. Presliminary stability results of the single chamber symmetric cell show that the electrochemical reduction of nitric oxide in symmetric cells with BSCF performed most reliably.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2296-2646			WOS:000512046500001	32039157

The carbon family members include carbon dots, carbon nanotubes, carbon fibers, graphene, graphite, graphdiyne and hard carbon, etc. They can be divided into different dimensions, and their structures can be open and porous. Moreover, it is very interesting to dope them with other elements (metal or non-metal) or hybridize them with other materials to form composites. The elemental and structural characteristics offer us to explore their applications in energy, environment, bioscience, medicine, electronics and others. Among them, energy storage and conversion are extremely attractive, as advances in this area may improve our life quality and environment. Some energy devices will be included herein, such as lithium-ion batteries, lithium sulfur batteries, sodium-ion batteries, potassium-ion batteries, dual ion batteries, electrochemical capacitors, and others. Additionally, carbon-based electrocatalysts are also studied in hydrogen evolution reaction and carbon dioxide reduction reaction. However, there are still many challenges in the design and preparation of electrode and electrocatalytic materials. The research related to carbon materials for energy storage and conversion is extremely active, and this has motivated us to contribute with a roadmap on 'Carbon Materials in Energy Storage and Conversion'.									110	21	0	0	4	0	111			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000523473300007	32073755

Three methods were used to investigate the effect of different preparation current density on corrosion resistance of Ti /beta-PbO_2-WC composite electrode materials in the electrolytic zinc liquid.The results show that at low current density, the rate of PbO_2 deposition is slow and the WC particles cannot be completely coated, the coating is too thin and its corrosion resistance is bad.However, at high current density, the coating is being thicker but the coating quality is influenced by the intensified oxygen evolution reaction which leads to bad corrosion resistance; at the 25 mA·cm~(-2)current density, the composite electrode has smaller corrosion current density i_(corr) and larger polarization resistance Rp, greater corrosion reaction activation energy Ea,bigger charge transfer resistance R_t, and larger coating resistance R_d,which corresponds to that the electrode has the best corrosion resistance prepared at the current density.			本论文为了研究钛基beta-PbO_2-WC复合惰性阳极材料在电解锌液中的腐蚀行为,采用了电化学交流阻抗谱(EIS)测量技术和Tafel曲线分析技术,并结合电极的表面形貌分析,考察了不同电沉积电流密度对所制备复合电极在电解锌液中的耐蚀性的影响。结果表明:低电流密度时,PbO_2的沉积速度慢,不能完全包覆WC微粒并共沉积,镀层太薄耐腐蚀性能低;高电流密度时,镀层较厚但析氧副反应加剧影响镀层质量导致其耐蚀性受影响;电流密度为25mA·cm~(-2)时,复合电极具有较小的自腐蚀电流密度i_(corr)和较大的极化电阻Rp、较大的腐蚀反应活化能Ea、较大的电荷转移电阻Rt以及较大的镀层电阻R_d,对应于该条件制得的电极有最好的耐蚀性能。						0	0	0		0	0	0			1004-1656			CSCD:6177430

Previous studies conducted under oscillating CO/O-2 feedstream conditions, allowed the identification of carbonates as the C-containing storage species on the catalyst surface, with their decomposition being the origin of CO2 evolution dynamics during O-2 pulses.A deeper comparison of the time-resolved DRIFTS and MS data revealed some differences that were related to the different observation points of the two detectors. Two methods for the determination of penetration depth of IR radiation in catalysts beds were compared and discussed. From the analysis of DRIFTS data, two main pathways for carbonates decomposition were found at the beginning of the bed of the catalysts: one leading to CO2 and Ce(IV) sites and another to CO and Ce(III). The last one is active only above 673 K. The preference of one pathway against the other is strictly related to the Ce(III)/Ce(IV) ratio that shows strong variation during the entire cycle.

J	ONO, TA; IZAWA, S; INOUE, Y								STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL MODULATION OF THE MANGANESE CLUSTER IN CA2+-DEPLETED PHOTOSYSTEM-II INDUCED BY BINDING OF THE 24-KILODALTON EXTRINSIC PROTEIN								BIOCHEMISTRY				31	33			7648	7655		10.1021/bi00148a028				AUG 25 1992	1992	Depletion of functional Ca2+ from photosystem (PS) II membranes impairs O2 evolution. Redox properties of the Mn cluster as probed by thermoluminescence were modified differently in Ca2+-depleted PSII depending on the procedure for Ca2+ extraction. Ca2+ depletion by low-pH treatment gave rise to an abnormally modified S2 state exhibiting a thermoluminescence band with elevated peak temperature accompanied by a marked upshift in threshold temperature for its formation, whereas Ca2+ depletion by NaCl washing in the light followed by the addition of EDTA could generate a similarly modified S2 state only when the Ca2+-depleted PSII was reconstituted with the 24-kDa extrinsic proteins. These results indicated that manifestation of the abnormal properties of the Ca2+-depleted S2 state is significantly contributed by the association of the 24-kDa extrinsic protein to PSII. It was inferred that the 24-kDa extrinsic protein regulates the structure and function of the Mn cluster in the absence of functional Ca2+ through a conformational modulation of the intrinsic protein(s) that bind(s) both Mn and Ca. Features of the extrinsic protein-dependent modulation of the Mn cluster were discussed in relation to the function of Ca2+ in O2 evolution.									33	0	0	0	31	0	33			0006-2960			WOS:A1992JK53300028	1510950

We develop here a facile fabrication of nickel-molybdenum carbide heterostructures embedded in large-area (100 cm2) hierarchically assembled nitrogen-enriched carbon, forming Mott-Schottky array on nickel foam (Ni-Mo2C/ NC@NF). The Ni-Mo2C/NC array is directly applied as the bifunctional catalyst with high activity and durability in alkaline electrolyte. Particularly, an extremely low overpotential of 40 mV is needed to generate hydrogen. Density functional theory calculation revealed that the formation of Ni-Mo2C Mott/NC Schottky interfaces enables favorable electronic structures for electrocatalytic water splitting. Besides, 3D hierarchical structure provides exposed active sites, facilitates mass and charge transfer, graphitic shells enhance stability. A symmetric electrolyzer using Ni-Mo2C/NC@NF generates 10 mA cm-2 at 1.59 V and operates steadily for 150 h, which even outperforms the noble metal couple, Pt/C//RuO2 for water electrolysis. The scalability, activity and durability renders Ni-Mo2C/NC@NF potential industrial application. The assembly-carburization strategy could be further applied for preparing Co-Mo2C/NC@NF and Cu-Mo2C/NC@NF.									22	0	0	0	2	0	22			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000663214700005

In particular, for the single atom catalysts (SACs), to facilitate interaction between the single atom and supports, precisely engineering the conductivity represents a promising strategy to design SACs with high electrochemical efficiency. Here we show rhodium (Rh) SAC anchored on Co3O4 nanosheets arrays on nickel foam (NF), which is modified by a facile phosphorus (P-doped Rh SAC-Co3O4/NF), possessing an appropriate electronic structure and high conductivity for electrocatalytic reaction. With the introduction of P atom in the lattice, the electrocatalyst demonstrates outstanding alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with 50 mA.cm(-2) under overpotential of 268 mV, 6 times higher than that of Ir/C/NF. More interestingly, the P-doped Rh SAC-Co3O4/NF can get 50 mA.cm(-2) at only 1.77 V for overall water splitting. Both electrical conductivity studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the high conductivity at grain boundary improves the charge transfer efficiency of the Rh catalytic center. Furthermore, other noble-metal (Ir, Pd, and Ru) doped Co3O4 nanosheets arrays are prepared to exhibit the general efficacy of the phosphorus doping strategy.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000835608600001		
J	Sona, Moon; Shima, Jaegyu; Parka, Sanghun; Yoon, Nakyung; Jeong, Kwanho; Cho, Kyung Hwa								Seawater battery desalination with sodium-intercalation cathode for hypersaline water treatment br								DESALINATION				531						115713	10.1016/j.desal.2022.115713				JUN 1 2022	2022	The seawater battery desalination (SWB-D) system has a unique feature of storing energy while desalinating water. Contrary to other electrochemical processes, such as capacitive de-ionization or battery electrode deionization, SWB-D can be used to directly desalinate seawater owing to the high sodium uptake of the sodium metal composed anode. However, a relatively long time is required for desalination in this newly developed SWB-D because of the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction at the cathode, hindering the practical application of the SWB-D system for desalination. Hence, we propose using a sodium-intercalating cathode (nickel hex-acyanoferrate; NiHCF) instead of a capacitive material (carbon felt) in the SWB-D system to overcome this limitation. The redox reaction of NiHCF doubled the applied current from 1 to 2 mA (from 6.5 to 13.0 A m2) under an initial threshold voltage of 4.5 V, resulting in nearly twice the salt removal rate for the hypersaline water treatment (1.2 M NaCl). In addition, the energy efficiency of the system significantly increased from approximately 61% to 86%. Therefore, using an intercalation cathode in the SWB-D system can minimize the time required for hypersaline water treatment with a higher energy efficiency.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0011-9164	1873-4464		WOS:000855952700008

We designed such a heterostructure configuration as an ideal model to understand the impact of the. MnCo2O4 and NiCo2O4 on the photoelectrocatalytic performances. Results showed that the FTO/PPy/NiCo2O4 possess superior photocurrent density (11.37 mA cm-2) compared to the FTO/PPy/Co3O4 (7.26 mA cm-2), and FTO/PPy/MnCo2O4 (9.16 mA cm-2) at 1.23 V vs. reverse hydrogen electrode (RHE). Moreover, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of the FTO/PPy/NiCo2O4 was obtained 1.4 and 1.8-folds higher than those considered for the FTO/PPy/MnCo2O4 and FTO/PPy/Co3O4, respectively. Specific spinel configuration of NiCo2O4 on PPy films provided the highest ECSA to access the carrier charge and their contribution in the redox reaction. The highest value of the O2 (5.256 mu mol. h-1) was exuded from the surface of the FTO/PPy/NiCo2O4 by 2.5 and 1.8 orders of magnitude compared to those estimated for FTO/PPy/Co3O4, FTO/PPy/MnCo2O4.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000689172900001

Although considerable work has been done in understanding the passivity and corrosion potential of steel in various electrolytes, an important aspect of the current work is in assessing the effects of multiyear exposures of steel in waste simulants and their effects on corrosion potential. It is shown that SCC susceptibility of steel in nitrate increases at the long-term corrosion potential in solutions without organics (either by applying that potential or letting the corrosion potential increase over time). The long-term increase in corrosion potential results principally from a decrease in the passive current density with time of exposure. The present work shows that such a reduction in passive current density is accompanied by changes in the semi-conductive properties of the passive film, which itself may be a result of changes in stoichiometry of the film over time. Nitrite reduction is the most likely cathodic reaction with a small contribution from oxygen reduction. However, the presence of organic species in the environment can result in additional anodic reactions that may decrease the corrosion potential.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0010-9312	1938-159X		WOS:000454514000009

However, instabilities in the materials and devices, primarily due to reactions with water, have kept PSCs from entering the marketplace. Here, laser beam induced current imaging is used to investigate the spatial and temporal evolution of the quantum efficiency of perovskite solar cells under controlled humidity conditions. Several interesting mechanistic aspects are revealed as the degradation proceeds along a four-stage process. Three of the four stages can be reversed, while the fourth stage leads to irreversible decomposition of the photoactive perovskite material. A series of reactions in the PbI2-CH3NH3I-H2O system explains the interplay between the interactions with water and the overall stability. Understanding of the degradation mechanisms of PSCs on a microscopic level gives insight into improving the long-term stability.									271	8	2	0	2	0	274			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000387134800010

Herein, we successfully synthesized a nickel-embedded carbon nanotube (Ni-NCNT) catalyst to selectively convert the monosaccharides into sugar acids under mild condition. The Ni-NCNT catalyst was highly reactive towards glucose and xylose oxidation, reaching 90.8% yield of gluconic acid and 88.4% yield of xylonic acid under the optimal condition. Theoretical calculations revealed that the intrinsic reaction mechanism of xylose oxidation involves the activation of the oxidant, adsorption of xylose, dissociation of the formyl C-H bond in xylose, formation of chemisorbed xylonic acid, and desorption of xylonic acid. The dissociation of the formyl C-H bond and the formation of adsorbed xylonic acid are key steps in the oxidation of xylose. The OH-, instead of O-2, acted as a direct oxidant and was crucial for the xylose oxidation. The highly active and cost-effective Ni-NCNT developed in this study provided a promising route to generate valuable chemicals from biomass. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, stable 2H phase of MoS2 (2H-MoS2) exhibits low catalytic activity in HER due to the inert basal plane and S-edge. Thus, to exploit the basal plane and S-edge for additional electrocatalytic activity, a facile strategy is developed to prepare P-doped 2H-MoS2 film on conductive substrate via low-temperature heat treatment. Due to the inherent difficulty of P-doping into MoS2 crystal structure, oxygen (O)-doping is utilized to aid the P-doping process, as supported by the first-principles calculations. Interestingly, P-doping could dramatically reduce Mo valence charge, which results in the functionalization of the inert MoS2 basal plane and S-edge. In agreement with simulation results, P-doped 2H-MoS2 electrode exhibits enhanced catalytic performance in H-2 generation with low onset potential (130 mV) and small Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1). The enhanced catalytic performance arises from the synergistic effect of the activated basal plane, S-edge, and Mo-edge sites, leading to favorable hydrogen adsorption energies. Most importantly, improved cyclic stability is achieved, which reveals chemically inert properties of P-doped 2H-MoS2 in acidic electrolyte.									124	6	0	0	5	0	123			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000394680200007

The concentration of HCl added to the reaction solution was found to be crucial for the shape evolution of palladium nanocrystals from nanocubes bounded by {100} facets to octahedrons by {1 1 1} facets. Palladium nanocubes can be readily obtained at a fast reduction rate without the involvement of additional HCl. With the introduction of a certain amount of HCl to the precursor solution, truncated nanocubes with {111} facets were formed, and the increase of HCl led to the slower reduction rate and the formation of palladium cuboctahedrons enclosed by six {100} facets and eight {111} facets at the expense of gradual shrinkage of {100} facets. The probable mechanism of morphological transformation was proposed upon a batch of experiments. The shape-dependent catalytic performances of as-obtained palladium nanocrystals were investigated by the structure-sensitive reaction of formic acid oxidation. It was found that catalytic activities of palladium nanocrystals displayed a strong dependence on the facets exposed on the surface, and cubic palladium exhibited the best catalytic performance compared with cubooctahedral and octahedral palladium nanocrystals.									78	8	0	0	4	0	79			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000330543600041

However, the electrochromic mechanism in NiOx is not yet clear, and the ionic species involved are sometimes ambiguous, particularly in aprotic electrolytes. We demonstrate herein that the "net coloration effect" originates from newly generated high-valence Ni3+/Ni4+ ions during anion-dependent anodization, and the Li+ intercalation/deintercalation only plays a role in modulating the oxidation state of Ni. Unambiguous evidences proving the occurrence of anodization reaction were obtained by both chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry. Benefiting from the irreversible polarization of Ni2+ to Ni3+/Ni4+, the quantity of voltammetric charge increases by similar to 38% under the same test conditions, enhancing the corresponding electrochromic modulation by similar to 8%. Strong linkages between the coloration, evolution, and degradation observed in this work provide in-depth insights into the electrocatalytic and electrochromic mechanisms.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000441477100025	30047734

Because of the lack of useful biomarkers for BPD, the gene expression of tracheal aspirate fluid (TAF) cells in premature infants was analyzed.Methods: Of 148 consecutive patients, 26 preterm infants (gestational age < 34 weeks) were enrolled, who underwent assisted ventilation at birth for respiratory failure. Patients with congenital disorders were excluded. Half of these infants developed BPD. Interleukin (IL)-10, interferon (IFN)-gamma, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B mRNA of TAF cells were quantified on real-time polymerase chain reaction.Results: IL-10 (P < 0.01) and IFN-g (P = 0.03) but not TGF-beta 1 or PDGF-B mRNA levels at birth were higher in BPD than in non-BPD infants. IL-10 expression differentiated BPD with the highest sensitivity (92%) and specificity (77%). IL-10 levels correlated with TGF-beta 1 (P = 0.03) and IFN-gamma (P = 0.01), but not with PDGF-B levels. When BPD infants were classified according to comorbidity (group 1, six patients who suffered respiratory distress syndrome [RDS] but not chorioamnionitis [CAM]; group 2, five patients who had CAM but not RDS), PDGF-B levels were higher in group 2 (P = 0.01). High IL-10 expression was selected as a risk factor for BPD in infants who had CAM but not RDS (P = 0.01), although prolonged oxygen therapy was the most sensitive indicator for BPD (P < 0.01) on multivariate analysis.Conclusions: High IL-10 expression in TAF cells at birth could predict the evolution of BPD, but with less impact than oxygen requirement. PDGF might play a different role in the inflammatory process of premature lungs.									10	1	1	0	8	0	12			1328-8067	1442-200X		WOS:000302935400008	22066648

The gold nanoparticles are generated in situ in an organic medium prior to the oxidation reaction. Various gold salts, preferably AuCl3 and HAuCl4 center dot 3H(2)O, can be applied in the presence of nanoceria and the amine substrate acts as the reducing agent. The synergism between gold and ceria evacuated at 200 degrees C has a remarkable positive effect on the oxidation activity. The catalysts have been tested in the oxidation of dibenzylamine, N-tert-butylbenzylamine, and indoline. Apparently, the presence of organic and inorganic residue after the in situ catalyst preparation does not diminish the oxidation activity of gold. An alternative, less efficient route is the quantitative adsorption of [Au(PPh3)Cl] precursor onto ceria in an organic medium; and the subsequent ex situ evolution of gold nanoparticles (ca. 5 nm) via calcination at 250-400 degrees C. This catalyst is still ten-fold more active than conventional supported gold nanoparticles. In addition, it is free from impurities evolving during the in situ preparation and thus may find application in reactions other than amine oxidation.									74	1	0	0	10	0	75			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000279479100014

In the present study, in-situ irradiated Fourier transform infrared spectrometer and electron paramagnetic resonance were applied to probe the formation mechanisms of EPFRs during photo-transformation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on montmorillonite surface. EPFRs were only detected on Fe(III)-montmorillonite containing PAHs with relatively high electron-donating ability, such as anthracene (ANT), but not in the systems of Fe(III)-montmorillonite spiked with phenanthrene or Na(I)-montmorillonite. The 1/e lifetime of the EPFRs was much shorter under light irradiation (5.49 h) than in dark (30.3 h), suggesting that light irradiation facilitated the transformation of EPFRs. On the one hand, light irradiation promoted direct electron transfer from ANT to the mineral surface, accelerating the formation of PAHs-type radical cations. On the other hand, light irradiation induced the generation of reactive oxygen species, which facilitated the transformation from radical cations to oxygenic EPFRs, which finally led to ANT degradation. This work clarified the underlying mechanisms for EPFRs generation and evolution on clay minerals.									39	4	0	0	31	0	42			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000449127500010	30236946

The results show that proper conditions can converse N2O to a large amount of NO. The reduction ability of char to NO produced by N2O in different atmospheres is not much different, but it will be greatly reduced at high temperature, indicating that the ability of char to prevent the second rise of NO is limited. In the oxidizing atmosphere, three reaction paths of N2O heterogeneous reduction were verified through the reduction of N2O by char under different oxygen concentrations. Low O-2 concentration at low temperature improves the char's reducing capacity, while at high temperature it enhances the oxidation capacity of O-2, promoting the oxidation consumption of char. The coexistence of iodine and char will reduce the effect of iodine on inhibiting the formation of NO, as well as char's reducing capacity. The iodine can promote the decomposition of N2O and inhibit the adsorption of N and O on the char surface.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000612064900008

Poly[1,1'-bis(diorganosilylethynyl)ferrocenes] (2) were pyrolysed, under argon, up to 1350 degrees C to give FexSiyCz phases with good yields, owing to the incorporation of the cyclopentadiene groups in the carbon matrix and the participation of nearly all silicon and iron in the ceramic residue. The pyrolysis of poly[{(diorganosilylene) diacetylene} dicobalt hexacarbonyls] (3) at 1350 degrees C gave Co2Si and graphite-like carbon. Evolution of part of the carbon monoxide of 3 in the early stage of the pyrolysis (100 degrees C) showed that the cross-linking of the diacetylene units was induced by reactive cobalt species. Furthermore, at higher temperatures (200-500 degrees C), cobalt clusters catalysed the ceramic formation. Co2Si was shown to result from the reaction of SiC with Co above 1000 degrees C, both formed during the pyrolysis process. Finally, at 1100 degrees C, a carboreduction reaction led to the elimination of the oxygen incorporated in the carbon matrix during the cross-linking process.									47	0	0	0	3	0	49			0022-328X			WOS:A1996TX64400017

The unique reaction environment provided by the evolved ammonia allows for stabilization of oxygen vacancies and reduced oxidation states of metal ions within an oxide matrix without the need for any post-treatment with flammable reducing agents. According to comprehensive characterization, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), neutron powder diffraction, and UV-vis spectroscopy, oxygen deficiency is accompanied by reduced oxidation states of metal centers (Cu+ or V4+), resulting in oxides with mixed-valence metal oxidation states. The amount of oxygen vacancies can be tuned by changing the annealing temperature providing control over band gaps of ternary metal oxides and mid-gap states from reduced metal centers. All synthesized vanadates are n-type semiconductors based on negative photovoltages obtained from surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS). A decay of the photovoltage with increasing annealing temperatures is attributed to electron trapping and electron/hole recombination at V4+ and Cu+ mid-gap states. This work shows for the first time the impact of oxygen vacancies on the electronic structure of DES synthesized oxides for solar energy conversion applications.									30	0	0	0	2	0	30			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472465300066

In this paper, we demonstrate the dynamic response of the photosynthetic apparatus to changes in Mn bioavailability in cyanobacteria. Cultures of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 could grow on Mn concentrations as low as 100 nM without any observable effect on their physiology. Below this threshold, a decline in the photochemical activity of photosystem II (PSII) occurred, as evident by lower oxygen evolution rates, lower maximal photosynthetic yield of PSII values, and faster Q A reoxidation rates. In 77 K chlorophyll fluorescence spectroscopy, a peak at 682 nm was observed. After ruling out the contribution of phycobilisome and iron stress-induced IsiA proteins, this band was attributed to the accumulation of partially assembled PSII. Surprisingly, the increase in the 682-nm peak was paralleled by a decrease in the 720-nm peak, dominated by PSI fluorescence. The effect on PSI was confirmed by measurements of the P 700 photochemical activity. The loss of activity was the result of two processes: loss of PSI core proteins and changes in the organization of PSI complexes. Blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed a Mn limitation-dependent dissociation of PSI trimers into monomers. The sensitive range for changes in the organization of the photosynthetic apparatus overlaps with the range of Mn concentrations measured in natural environments. We suggest that the ability to manipulate PSI content and organization allows cyanobacteria to balance electron transport rates between the photosystems. At naturally occurring Mn concentrations, such a mechanism will provide important protection against light-induced damage.									41	0	0	0	38	0	41			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000285838300051	21088228

We observe that N and S dopants in TiO2 NTs lead to an enhancement of their visible-lightdriven photocatalytic response, thereby increasing their ability to split H2O molecules. The differences between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied impurity levels inside the band gap (Horn and LUIL, respectively) are reduced in these defective nanotubes down to 2.4 and 2.5 eV for N and S doping, respectively. The band gap of an No+So codoped titania nanotube is narrowed down to 2.2 eV (while preserving the proper disposition of the gap edges relatively to the reduction and oxidation potentials, so that slim < eoztHao < thus decreasing the photon energy required for splitting of H2O molecule. For C- and Fe-doped TiO2 NTs, some impurity levels lie in the interval between both redox potentials, which would lead to electron hole recombination. Our calculations also reveal in sulfur-doped SrTiO3 NTs a suitable band distribution for the oxygen evolution reaction, although the splitting of water molecules would be hardly possible due to an unsuitable conduction band position for the hydrogen reduction reaction.									86	3	0	0	5	0	86			1932-7447			WOS:000359683800075

We are proposing global carbon dioxide recycling to use renewable energy so that all people in the whole world can survive. The electricity will be generated by solar cell in deserts and used to produce hydrogen by seawater electrolysis at t nearby desert coasts. Hydrogen, for which no infrastructures of transportation and combustion exist, will be converted to methane at desert coasts by the reaction with carbon dioxide captured by energy consumers. Among systems in global carbon dioxide recycling, seawater electrolysis and carbon dioxide methanation have not been performed industrially. We created energy-saving cathodes for hydrogen production and anodes for oxygen evolution without chlorine formation in seawater electrolysis, and ideal catalysts for methane formation by the reaction of carbon dioxide with hydrogen.

In the early stage of deformation, preexisting scale fractures in a brittle and intergranular way. Due to the concentrated strain field formed in front of crack tip, t -> m martensitic transformation of t-ZrO2 takes place. With tensile strain increasing, multiple oxide regions consisting of t-ZrO2 dendrites form around fractures due to the combined action of oxidation, deformation and fracture. The formation and fracture of scales under large strains seriously deteriorate the surface finish and dimension accuracy of thermoplastic forming parts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0010-938X	1879-0496		WOS:000456902100017		
J	Liu, Peng; Zhang, Dexiang								Effect of hydrothermal treatment on the carbon structure of Inner Mongolia lignite								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				7	3	SI		493	503		10.1007/s40789-020-00356-7				SEP 2020	2020	Understanding the structural properties of lignite during hydrothermal treatment would aid in predicting the subsequent behavior of coal during the pyrolysis, liquefaction, and gasification processes. Here, hydrothermal treatment of Inner Mongolia lignite (IM) was carried out in a lab autoclave. The distribution of carbon in the lignite was monitored via solid C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and the functional groups of oxygen in lignite were determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The curve-fitting method was used to calculate the content of the functional groups quantitatively. The results show that hydrothermal treatment is an effective method for upgrading the lignite. The side chains of the aromatic ring in lignite are altered, while the main macromolecular structure remains nearly the same. The hydrothermal treatment of IM could be divided into three temperature-dependent stages. The first stage (<493 K) is the decomposition reaction of oxygen functional groups, where the O/C ratio decreases from 0.203 in raw IM to 0.185 for the IM treated at 493 K. In the second stage (493-533 K), hydrolysis of functional groups and hydrogen transfer between water and lignite occur. Here, the ratio of methylene to methyl increases from 0.871 in IM-493 to 1.241 for IM-533, and the content of quinone generates from the condensation of free phenol increased. The third stage (>533 K) involves breakage of the covalent bond, and the content of CH4 and CO in the emission gas clearly increase.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2095-8293	2198-7823		WOS:000703998400008

There are variety of factors that impact CO2R activity and selectivity, including the catalyst surface structure, morphology, composition, the choice of electrolyte ions and pH, and the electrochemical cell design. Many of these factors are often intertwined, which can complicate catalyst discovery and design efforts. Here we take a broad and historical view of these different aspects and their complex interplay in CO2R catalysis on Cu, with the purpose of providing new insights, critical evaluations, and guidance to the field with regard to research directions and best practices. First, we describe the various experimental probes and complementary theoretical methods that have been used to discern the mechanisms by which products are formed, and next we present our current understanding of the complex reaction networks for CO2R on Cu. We then analyze two key methods that have been used in attempts to alter the activity and selectivity of Cu: nanostructuring and the formation of bimetallic electrodes. Finally, we offer some perspectives on the future outlook for electrochemical CO2R.									1311	57	0	0	87	0	1311			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000473251600013	31117420

Using this newly developed method, we successfully observed almost identical phase diagrams during heating and cooling, indicating thermodynamic equilibrium. In addition, we obtained changes in the constituent phase fraction after quenching. Temperature-reversible changes in the dhcp-Nd fraction were observed from 475 degrees C to 650 degrees C, corresponding to a eutectic reaction in the Nd-Cu phase. The fcc-NdOx fraction decreased with the increase in the Nd2O3 fraction above 1000 degrees C, which behavior was attributed to a phase change from fcc-NdOx to high-temperature liquid and hcp-Nd2O3 phases. The measurements verify the thermodynamic database recently constructed for CALPHAD calculations of the Nd-Fe-B-Cu-O system by assuming the local thermodynamic equilibrium of the Nd oxides within the microstructure of the magnet.

However, the photocurrent density of BiVO4-based photoanode is still much less than its theoretical value of 7.5 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V-RHE. The performance of BiVO4 is generally considered to be hindered by its photocorrosion and sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction. Herein, a hybrid BiVO4-based photoanode is constructed by modifying nanoporous BiVO4 with a Fe-phenolic layer (FTA) and a case of molecular catalyst 1 ([CO4(H2O)(4)(HPMIDA)(2)(PMIDA)(2)](6-)). The FTA layer with abundant phenolic groups can protect BiVO4 from photocorrosion. With assembling catalyst 1 on FTA interlayer, an eye-catching photocurrent density of 5.5 mA/cm(2) is obtained at 1.23 V-RHE, which is much higher than that of bare BiVO4 (1.5 mA/cm(2)). The stability of 1/FTA/BiVO4 photoanode is investigated, maintaining 93% of the photocurrent density at 0.7 V-RHE after 3 h stability test. Systematic studies reveal that the excellent PEC activity comes from the protection of BiVO4 and the enhancement of surface reaction efficiency. These results support the concept of designing and assembling hybrid photoanode containing heterogeneous cocatalyst and molecular catalyst for efficient solar-fuel conversion.									41	2	0	0	3	0	41			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000496894300013

In order to characterize the main mechanisms governing the precipitation of HT compounds, potential sweeps or pulses were applied at both plates and foams dipped in nitrate and chloride baths, with and without Mg2+ and Al3+ precipitating cations. Moreover, nitrate reduction products were analyzed. The features of coatings and pH near foam supports were correlated to electrochemical results.Nitrate and oxygen reduction, as well as H-2 evolution, contributed to a pH increase during the electrodeposition of HT compounds, but nitrate reduction was responsible for the highest pH increase at the electrode-electrolyte interface. FeCrAlloy showed a low activity in nitrate reduction to nitrite and ammonia. Mg2+ and Al3+ precipitating cations fostered electrochemical reduction and modified reaction products. The shape of the support, foam or plate, did not significantly alter the electrical conductivity and reduction potentials, but it did affect current density and H-2 bubble formation.

The objective of the study is to explain the effect of the heat losses from lateral boundaries in the front smolder propagation. The developed numerical code is capable of predicting the fire initiation and the smoldering (slow-burning) characteristics of foam insulation materials. The finite volume discretization and the bi-conjugate gradient stabilized method are used to solve the system governing equations. The chemical kinetics model is based on a first order pyrolysis reaction, followed by oxidation of the porous fuel and the carbonaceous char residual. This second oxidation reaction might promote the transition from smoldering to,flaming and thus fire initiation. The gas and solid temperature, and the oxygen and the char mass fraction two-dimensional temporal evolutions are computed Different heat and mass transfer coefficients are used to simulate the heat losses to the surrounding Non-reacted foam regions are observed near the side wall, confirming experimental observations. The base case is chosen to represent the experimental conditions reported in the literature. The numerical predictions show very good agreement with the published experimental and J-D numerical results.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0354-9836	2334-7163		WOS:000255400700007

Regulating the surrounding environment of active sites, including electron structure and coordination environment via atom-level interface regulation, to design and construct an advanced SACs is of great significance for boosting electrocatalytic reactions. In this review, we systemically summarized the fundamental understandings and intrinsic mechanisms of SACs for electrocatalytic applications based on the interface site regulations. We elaborated the several different regulation strategies of SACs to demonstrate their ascendancy in electrocatalytic applications. Firstly, the interfacial electronic interaction was presented to reveal the electron transfer behavior of active sites. Secondly, the different coordination structures of metal active center coordinated with two or three non-metal elements were also summarized. In addition, other atom-level interfaces of SACs, including metal atom- atom interface, metal atom-X-atom interface (X: non-metal element), metal atom-particle interface, were highlighted and the corresponding promoting effect towards electrocatalysis was disclosed. Finally, we outlooked the limitations, perspectives and challenges of SACs based on atomic interface regulation.

Herein, a general approach for anode and cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is presented that enables to transfer the concept of surface Pourbaix diagrams from electrocatalysis to electrode materials employed in LIBs. This novel approach is exemplified at the example of the (111) facet for a single-crystalline spinel lithium titanate (LTO) model electrode by combining constrained thermodynamics and density functional theory calculations.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			2196-0216			WOS:000419269000027

Over geological time, chemical exchanges between those reservoirs have produced a diversity of reduced carbon materials that differ in their molecular structures and reactivity. This reactive complexity challenges the canonical dichotomy between the surface and deep, short-term and long-term organic carbon cycle. Old and refractory carbon materials are not confined to the lithosphere but are ubiquitous in the surface environment, and the lithosphere hosts various forms of reduced carbon that can be very reactive. The biological and geological pathways that drive the organic carbon cycle have changed through time; from a synthesis of these changes, it emerges that although a biosphere is required to produce organic carbon, mortality is required to ensure its export to the lithosphere, and graphitization is essential for its long-term stabilization in the solid Earth. Among the by-products of the organic carbon cycle are the accumulation of a massive lithospheric reservoir of organic carbon, the accumulation of dioxygen in the atmosphere and the rise of a terrestrial biosphere. Besides driving surface weathering reactions, free dioxygen has allowed the evolution of new metabolic pathways to produce and respire organic carbon. From the evolution of photosynthesis until the expansion of biomineralization in the Phanerozoic, inorganic controls on the organic carbon cycle have diversified, tightening the connection between the biosphere and geosphere.A review of the organic carbon cycle explores the interactions between the Earth's surface and deeper reservoirs, the expanding inorganic controls on the organic carbon cycle, and how these links have strengthened through geological time.									13	2	0	0	1	1	15			1752-0894	1752-0908		WOS:000552918600001

Further, the fast evolution of flexible and wearable opto-electronic systems, superior reliability, and ultra-long cycling lives of energy storage devices are of great importance. The poor kinetics of small reactions involved in next-generation energy devices are the main obstacles. The required electrode materials for these devices are emerging tasks for the betterment of these devices. Currently, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have gained pronounced interest as emerging and potential applicants as electrode materials for fruitful results. Herein, we have discussed the recent design principles for the fabrication of SACs for rechargeable batteries (Metal-air battery (Metal = Zn, Al, Li), Metal-sulfur battery, (Metal = Na, Li) and Metal-CO 2 battery (Metal = Zn, Li)) and fuel cells. Then, we have summarized the recent advances in assembling and performance of these batteries using SACs as electrode materials. Finally, we have elucidated the role of SACs to resolve the bottle-neck problems of these next-generation energy storage systems.

J	Wang, Gang; Cai, Weiquan; Fan, Ting; Ji, Yongfei								Nitrogen-doped graphdiyne for efficient electrocatalytic N-2 reduction: A first-principles study								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				570						151109	10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.151109		SEP 2021		DEC 30 2021	2021	Electrocatalytic fixation of N-2 has attracted intensive attention as an alternative for the Harbor-Bosh technique. In this work, the activity of N-doped graphdiyne (GDY) for electrochemical N-2 reduction reaction (NRR) was investigated with density functional theory. Four different models were considered, namely the Graph-N, spN-1, sp-N-2, and pyridinic-N GDY. Electronic structure analysis reveals that N-doing increases the positive charges on adjacent carbon atoms, which greatly promotes the adsorption and activation of N-2. The sp-N-2 GDY is the most active one among the substitutionally doped models with a limiting potential of -0.99 V. For pyridinic-N GDY, NRR follows a Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) pathway with a limiting-potential of -1.22 V. More importantly, we found that Graph-C vacancy created in the MvK path can efficiently reduce N-2 with a low limiting-potential of -0.41 V via a hybrid pathway. Besides, the selectivity for NRR over hydrogen evolution reaction is also enhanced on sp-N-2 GDY and the defective GDY with Graph-C vacancy. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of the activity and selectivity of N-doped GDY and suggests that the sp-N-2 and pyridinic-N doping greatly enhance the performance of GDY for NRR.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000711224900006

Herein, we report the cobalt aluminum hydroxide [Co1Al2(OH)(m)] supported on graphitic carbon nitride (g-CNx) composite materials for superior OER activity in alkaline conditions. One-pot microwave heating of aqueous solution of Co(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O and Al(NO3)(3)center dot 9H(2)O in the presence of g-CNx successfully produced Co1Al2(OH)(m) nanosheets impregnated on g-CNx. The composite catalyst requires a low overpotential of 0.32 V to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a low value of the Tafel slope (36 mV/dec). The catalyst has very high mass activity and turnover frequency values of 1211 mA mg(-1) and 0.62 s(-1) at 0.35 V, which are similar to 25 and 36 times higher compared to commercial IrO2, respectively. Most importantly, the electrocatalyst shows remarkably high stability compared to commercial 110 2 in alkaline medium. The two-dimensional sheet morphology, higher electrochemical surface area of the Co1Al2 (OH)(m) layered double hydroxide (LDH)/g-CNx composite, and strong interaction between the support and Co1Al2(OH)(m) LDH nanosheets could be the reason for superior activity and durability of the composite material.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000631407400047

The electro-chemical method was used to measure the mass transfer rate on a boiling surface. Potassium ferricyanide and hydrogen peroxide were used as the nonvolatile and volatile reaction species, respectively. It was found that for both volatile and nonvolatile species, the mass transfer rate was increased in the subcooled nucleate boiling region where the subcooled electrolyte temperature varied between 80 degrees C and 95 degrees C. This was a result of the enhanced micromixing effect. On the other hand, under the fully developed nucleate boiling region where the electrolyte temperature remained relatively constant at 96 degrees C, the increase in mass transfer rate with increasing heat flux was attributed to the increased macromixing effects. Also, the mass transfer rate for hydrogen peroxide was found to increase at higher rate than that of ferricyanide ions because of the volatile nature of hydrogen peroxide, allowing it to be transferred through both liquid and vapor phases during the reaction.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0010-9312	1938-159X		WOS:000360139100007

In addition, the photosynthetic characteristics of wild-type C. reinhardtii and cia3 mutants lacking the activity of carbonic anhydrase Cah3 were examined. Western blot analysis revealed the lack of cross reaction with antibodies to Cah3 in the mutant lacking the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center, in contrast to the mutant deficient in light-harvesting complex of PSII. These data show that the lumenal Cah3 is associated with polypeptides on the donor side of PSII reaction center. Using immunoelectron microscopy and antibodies to Cah3 from C. reinhardtii, we showed for the first time that the major part of thylakoid Cah3 is localized in the pyrenoid where the bulk of Rubisco is located. The rate of photosynthetic oxygen evolution and PSII photochemical efficiency were lower in C. reinhardtii cia3 mutant than in the wild type, especially in the cells grown at limiting CO2 concentrations. These observations show that Cah3 takes part in CO2-concentrating mechanism of the chloroplast. The results support our hypothesis [1, 2] that the carboxylation reaction in microalgae proceeds in the pyrenoid, a specific Rubisco-containing part of the chloroplast, which acquires CO2 from the lumen of intrapyrenoid thylakoids. We discuss significance of the pyrenoid as an autonomous metabolic microcompartment, in which Cah3 plays a key role in the production and concentration of CO2 for Rubisco. These functions may promote the photosynthetic efficiency owing to the effective CO2 supply for the Calvin cycle.									28	0	1	0	27	0	29			1021-4437	1608-3407		WOS:000271541300005

It is well known that standard GGA exchange and correlation in some cases is not sufficient to address reduction and oxidation reactions. Especially the formation energy of the oxygen molecule and the electron self-interaction for localized d and f electrons are known shortcomings. In this paper we show that despite the known problems, it is possible to calculate the stability of a wide range of rutile oxides MO2, with M being Pt, Ru, Ir, Os, Pb, Re, Mn, Se, Ge, Ti, Cr, Nb, W, Mo, and V, using the electrochemical series as reference. The mean absolute error of the formation energy is 0.29 eV using the revised Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) GGA functional. We believe that the reason for the success is due to the reference level being H-2 and H2O and not O-2 and due to a more accurate description of exchange for this particular GGA functional compared to PBE. Furthermore, we would expect the self-interaction problem to be largest for the most localized d orbitals; that means the late 3d metals and since Co, Fe, Ni, and Cu do not form rutile oxides they are not included in this study. We show that the variations in formation energy can be understood in terms of a previously suggested model separating the formation energy into a metal deformation contribution and an oxygen binding contribution. The latter is found to scale with the filling of the d band.									260	4	0	0	10	0	260			2469-9950	2469-9969		WOS:000262978400036

Because hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a common product of both oxidizing and reducing radicals generated during the VUV irradiation process, monitoring the variations in H2O2 levels can help us better understand the presence and relative dominance of different radicals. In this study, we systematically evaluated the effects of several selected anions on the formation of H2O2 under a variety of pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions. Results show that although addition of these anions inhibited the formation of H2O2, their H2O2-inhibition mechanisms are markedly different. At low concentrations (<= 1.0 mg/L), chloride reduced the generation of H2O2 primarily by consuming hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH); however, in high concentrations (11.0 mg/L), its light-screening effect was dominant. In comparison, the presence of bromide (<= 1.0 mg/L) inhibited H2O2 formation mainly by reacting rapidly with both center dot OH and H2O2. Carbonate and phosphorous species exerted influence mainly by consuming center dot OH. Along with irradiation, increasing pH significantly decreased H2O2 levels, confirming that H2O2 was formed mainly by center dot OH. In contrast, raising DO did not raise H2O2 maximum yields, confirming that reducing radicals like aqueous electrons (e(aq)(-)) and hydrogen atoms (center dot H) are not the key precursors of H2O2 in this process. Mathematically, the evolutions of H2O2 can be reliably modeled (R-2 >= 0.80) using a kinetics model incorporating H2O2 formation and decomposition kinetics. The results of this study may contribute to better understanding the use of VUV technology in water/wastewater treatment.									4	1	0	0	2	0	5			0013-9351	1096-0953		WOS:000639328800044	33472042

PCC 7942 cells to accumulate glycinebetaine when choline is supplemented exogenously. First, we observed two types of protective effect of glycinebetaine against beat-induced inactivation of photosystem II (PSII) in darkness; the codA transgene shifted the temperature range of inactivation of the oxygen-evolving complex from 40-52 degrees C (with half inactivation at 46 degrees C) to 46-60 degrees C (with half inactivation at 54 degrees C) and that of the photochemical reaction center from 44-55 degrees C (with half inactivation at 51 degrees C) to 52-63 degrees C (with half inactivation at 58 degrees C). However, in light, PSII was more sensitive to heat stress; when moderate heat stress, such as 40 degrees C, was combined with light stress, PSII was rapidly inactivated, although these stresses, when applied separately, did not inactivate either the oxygen-evolving complex or the photochemical reaction center. Further our studies demonstrated that the moderate heat stress inhibited the repair of PSII during photoinhibition at the site of synthesis de novo of the D1 protein but did not accelerate the photodamage directly. The codA transgene and, thus, the accumulation of glycinebetaine alleviated such an inhibitory effect of moderate heat stress on the repair of PSII by accelerating the synthesis of the D1 protein. We propose a hypothetical scheme for the cyanobacterial photosynthesis that moderate heat stress inhibits the translation machinery and glycinebetaine protects it against the heat-induced inactivation.

Nevertheless, their weak adsorption capacity for CO2 usually results in a rapidly decayed CO faradaic efficiency (FECO) in the course of pursuing a commercial CO current density (j(CO)) by increasing the overpotential. Herein, we axially graft pyridine molecules on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes to construct a metal-free composite electrocatalyst (Py-N4CNTs-800) with enhanced CO2 affinity for CO2ER to efficiently generate CO. Py-N4CNTs-800 exhibits a prominent FECO of 96% at -0.99 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) with a desirable j(CO) of 18.4 mA cm(-2), and FECO can even be maintained above 90% in a wide electrochemical potential window (-0.79 to -1.19 V). In situ infrared spectra unambiguously indicate that grafted axial pyridine molecules can facilitate the CO2 adsorption and suppress the occurrence of competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations enlighten that the introduction of pyridine molecules could dramatically stabilize the key intermediate *COOH, which effectively accelerates the reaction kinetics rate. Notably, Py-N4CNTs-800 delivers a promising j(CO) of 217 mA cm(-2) at -0.9 V in a flow cell, showing a bright prospect of function strengthened carbon nanomaterial for industrial applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000741067800001

However, kinetic data on that particular reaction are lacking due to the conjunction of the high reactivity of ALA in presence of oxygen and the diacetyl and ALA specific measurement difficulties. The use of a gas chromatographic technique coupled with a gas membrane sensor equipped bioreactor with a controlled atmosphere nonetheless allows the on-line acquisition of diacetyl production kinetics by lactococci cultures or directly from ALA. Thus, this paper provides kinetic data on both diacetyl microbiological production and extra-and intracellular ALA oxidative decarboxylation. The comparison of these kinetics shows that oxidative decarboxylation can account for diacetyl biological production and that this reaction is located at the intracellular level. Moreover, the evolution of the pattern of intracellular kinetics with and without heat treatment demonstrates the action of a thermolabile compound in oxidative decarboxylation.

Although TiO2 showed no visible light absorption, each of the MOx/TiO2 composites was capable of absorbing visible light. Activities during visible-light-driven water oxidation were examined using these materials in the presence of Ag+ as an electron acceptor. Co and Ni were found to be effective modifiers and promoted water oxidation with TiO2, whereas CoOx/TiO2 exhibited the highest activity. The catalytic activities of the MOx series during "dark" water oxidation were also investigated, employing an established photochemical water oxidation scheme with a Ru(II) trisdiimine complex as a redox photosensitizer in conjunction with weak visible light illumination. Under these conditions, the effect of light absorption by MOx/TiO2 on the reaction could be neglected. This investigation revealed that CoOx/TiO2 had by far the highest activity among the MOx/TiO2 composites. This work thus highlights the important role of the dark water oxidation process that occurs on the MOx surface in determining the overall efficiency of MOx/TiO2 during photocatalytic water oxidation.									12	0	0	0	1	0	11			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000466053600029

One of the most outstanding properties of these enzymes is the ability to catalyze the oxidation a wide range of organic substrates (both aromatic and aliphatic) through cytochrome P450-like reactions (the so-called peroxygenase activity), which involves the insertion of an oxygen atom from hydrogen peroxide. To catalyze this reaction, the substrate must access a channel connecting the bulk solution to the heme group. The composition, shape, and flexibility of this channel surely modulate the catalytic ability of the enzymes in this family. In order to gain an understanding of the role of the residues comprising the channel, mutants derived from PaDa-I, a laboratory-evolved UPO variant fromAgrocybe aegerita, were obtained. The two phenylalanine residues at the surface of the channel, which regulate the traffic towards the heme active site, were mutated by less bulky residues (alanine and leucine). The mutants were experimentally characterized, and computational studies (i.e., molecular dynamics (MD)) were performed. The results suggest that these residues are necessary to reduce the flexibility of the region and maintain the topography of the channel.									5	0	0	0	3	0	5				1422-0067		WOS:000565149900001	32785123

By applying accurate first-principles quantum calculations based on DFT with the screened non-local hybrid HSE06 functional, we bring rational insights at the atomic level into the influence of non-stoichiometric compositions on essential properties of tantalum (oxy) nitride compounds as visible-light-responsive photocatalysts for water splitting. Indeed, recent experiments show that such non-stoichiometry is inherent to the nitridation methods of tantalum oxide with unavoidable oxygen impurities. We considered here O-enriched Ta3N5 and N-enriched TaON materials. Although their structural parameters are found to be very similar to those of pure compounds and in good agreement with available experimental studies, their photocatalytic features for visible-light-driven overall water splitting reactions show different behaviors. Further partial nitration of TaON leads to a narrowed band gap, but partially oxidizing Ta3N5 causes only subtle changes in the gap. The main influence, however, is on the band edge positions relative to water redox potentials. The pure Ta3N5 is predicted to be a good candidate only for H+ reduction and H-2 evolution, while the pure TaON is predicted to be a good candidate for water oxidation and O-2 evolution. Non-stoichiometry has here a positive influence, since partially oxidized tantalum nitride, Ta(3-x)N(5-5x)O5x (for x >= 0.16) i.e. with a composition in between TaON and Ta3N5, reveals suitable band edge positions that correctly bracket the water redox potentials for visible-light-driven overall water splitting reactions. Among the various explored Ta(3-x)N(5-5x)O5x structures, a strong stabilization is obtained for the configuration displaying a strong interaction between the O-impurities and the created Ta-vacancies. In the lowest-energy structure, each created Ta-vacancy is surrounded by five O-impurity species substituting the five N sites characterizing one octahedral environment.									81	2	0	0	0	0	81			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000342072300035	25148446

Herein, exfoliated CoAl layered double hydroxides (CoAl-LDHs) were successfully decorated on alpha-Fe2O3 films by using layer-by-layer assembly method with the assistance of common anions (An-), such as NO3-, CO32-, SO42- and PO43-. Results indicated An--CoAl-LDHs/alpha-Fe2O3 photoanodes exhibited strong anion-dependent performance for PEC water oxidation. The NO3-, CO32-, SO(4)(2-)and PO43- engineered CoAl-LDHs/alpha-Fe2O3 displayed the photocurrent density at 1.23 V in 1 mol L-1 KOH of 1.90, 2.36, 3.19 and 4.30mAcm(-2), which were ca. 2.5, 3.1, 4.2 and 5.6 times that of bare alpha-Fe2O3 (0.76mAcm(-2)) respectively. Experimental studies indicated tetrahedral PO43- and SO42- were much more feasible for the assembly of CoAl-LDHs than that of triangular NO3- and CO32-, thus caused higher electrochemical surface area (ECSA). The anion with higher charge number and the tetrahedral configuration were more beneficial for the charge separation in bulk alpha-Fe2O3 and the charge transfer between CoAl-LDHs slabs. Mott-Schottky tests suggested p-n heterojunctions were formed at the interface of alpha-Fe2O3 and CoAl-LDHs, which could inhibit the surface charge recombination and further increase charge separation. As a result, PO43--CoAl-LDHs/alpha-Fe2O3 displays the best performance for PEC water oxidation. The strategy of engineering exfoliated CoAl-LDHs with anions on alpha-Fe2O3 in this work will stimulate us to fabricate highly efficient photoanodes with various anions and LDHs materials.									28	2	0	0	6	0	28			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000459903100050

XRD-powder data refinements (Rietveld method) have demonstrated that both compound series crystallize in the spinel structure (Fd (3) over barm) and exhibit similar inversion rates. This low-temperature route lead to metastable phases with crystallite sizes around 40 nm whereas particle sizes are larger than 1 mu m in the case of solid-state route. This preparative method largely described in the literature allows stabilizing reduced copper states thanks to the presence of reductive organic species, which are decomposed below T = 700 degrees C. The absorption spectra of the x = 0.15 composition exhibit strong differences depending on the synthesis route. These differences can be explained by the occurrence of Cu2+/Cu+ mixed valencies in compounds prepared by the low-temperature route; 33% of monovalent copper has been identified in the x = 0.15 composition prepared by low-temperature process, whereas the solid-state compound contains only divalent copper. Reductive properties of polyesterification reaction implying citric acid and low annealing temperature (T = 700 degrees C) are mainly responsible of the occurrence of the Cu2+/Cu+ mixed valencies. Actually, the annealing under air at T = 1000 degrees C of divided zinc-copper aluminates prepared at low temperatures (T = 700 degrees C) leads to the oxidation reaction Cu+ -> Cu2+ + e(-) confirmed by the evolution of magnetic measurements, ESR spectra, and optical absorption properties. Defects such as oxygen vacancies in the anionic network leading to reduction in the cations coordination number could also explain the strong evolution of optical absorption spectra especially around lambda = 700 nm where intervalencies transfer (Cu+/Cu2+) as well as intra-atomic d-d transitions (Cu2+ in a 5-fold coordination) can occur. Finally the occurrence of monovalent and divalent copper at the surface of such divided oxides, probably in tetrahedral sites, has been demonstrated by FTIR spectroscopy using the co-adsorption of CO and NO as probe molecules.									28	2	0	0	0	0	28			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000246209800036	17417834

In this work, we report a facile decoration of ruthenium species onto tungsten oxides to construct the Mott-Schottky heterojunction electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution. The resultant Ru-WO(2.72 )hybrid exhibits a superior Ru-based mass activity of 161.6 times higher than that of commercial Ru/C for hydrogen evolution, featuring a Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1) and 40 mV overpotential at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The uniform distribution of Ru species triggers a strong electron transfer across the Ru-WO2.72 Schottky barrier, resulting in a largely increased local electron density on the active Ru surface. Such electron enrichment induced by the Mott-Schottky effect at the metal-metal oxides interface is responsible for enhanced hydrogen production. This work demonstrates an effective strategy by Mott-Schottky effect to regulate electron distribution, which would evoke more inspiration in designing efficient electrocatalysis and beyond.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000788163800002

Herein, a bifunctional catalyst, cobalt-chromium phosphide (Co2Cr1-P) merged with a substrate of three-dimensional graphene foam (3DGF), was reported. The Co2Cr1-P@3DGF composite demonstrates remarkable electrocatalytic activities for the production of hydrogen and oxygen in 1.0 M KOH, which only requires a low overpotential of 118 and 270 mV to afford 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Additionally, when applying Co2Cr1-P@3DGF as a catalytic electrode for alkaline overall water splitting, the demanded cell voltage at 10 mA cm(-2) is merely 1.56 V. The superior performance is attributable to the incorporation of the Cr element into CoP and the good conductivity of the 3D graphene network substrate.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2052-1553			WOS:000599443400012

However, the overall solid oxide co-electrolysis process is complicated, involving both electrochemical reaction and reverse water gas shift reaction. The present paper offers a brief overview of the fundamental knowledge related to solid oxide co-electrolysis cells, such as working principle, thermodynamics and Nernst potentials. In addition, chemical equilibrium co-electrolysis models are reviewed, which have been developed to reveal the systematic relationship between the operating conditions and the Nernst potential as well as the gas composition evolution. Finally, the electrochemical performances recently reported on a number of solid oxide co-electrolysis cells are summarized, and cell degradation mechanisms occurred on solid oxide cells using Ni-based cermets cathode are also reviewed.

The samples for EPR measurements were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen at different times after H2O2 was added at 3- and 10-fold molar excess to 100 mu M metHb in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 37 degrees C Precautions were taken to remove all catalase from the haemoglobin preparation and no molecular oxygen evolution was detected during the reaction. On addition of H2O2 the EPR signals (- 196 degrees C) of both high spin and low spin metHb rapidly decreased and free radicals were formed. The low temperature (- 196 degrees C) EPR spectrum of the free radicals formed in the reaction has been deconvoluted into two individual EPR signals, one being an anisotropic signal (g(parallel to) = 2.035 and g(perpendicular to) = 2.0053), and the other an isotropic singlet(g = 2.0042, Delta H = 20 G). The former signal was assigned to peroxyl radicals. As the kinetic behaviour of both peroxyl (ROO(.)) and nonperoxyl (P-.) free radicals were similar, we concluded that ROO(.) radicals are not formed from P-. radicals by addition of O-2. The time courses for both radicals showed a steady state during the time required for H2O2 to decompose. Once all peroxide was consumed, the radical decayed with a first order rate constant of 1.42 x 10(-3) s(-1) (1:3 molar ratio). The level of the steady state was higher and its duration shorter at lower initial concentration of H2O2. The formation of the rhombic Fe(III) non-haem centres with g = 4.35 was found. Their yield was proportional to the H2O2 concentration used and the centres were ascribed to haem degradation products. The reaction was also monitored by EPR spectroscopy at room temperature. The kinetics of the free radicals measured in the reaction mixture at room temperature was similar to that observed when the fast freezing method and EPR measurement at - 196 degrees C were used.									33	0	1	0	20	0	34			1071-5762	1029-2470		WOS:A1996UG13900003	8731011

In addition to the electrical conductivity and stability, the number of inner tubes or walls also influence the electrocatalytic activity of the supported catalysts. Here we study the electrocatalytic activity of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) supported on CNTs (Pt/CNTs) as a function of number of walls towards ORR in both alkaline and acid solutions. The results indicate that the mechanism of ORR on Pt/CNTs does not change with the number of walls of CNTs support but the number of walls of CNTs supports has a significant effect on the electrocatalytic activity of supported Pt NPs. Pt NPs supported on double-walled CNTs (DWCNTs) exhibit a much better activity for ORR, as compared with that supported on single-walled and multi-walled CNTs (SWCNTs and MWCNTs). The high electrocatalytic activity of DWCNTs-supported Pt NPs is contributed to the fast electron transfer between the outer wall and inner tubes of DWCNTs for ORR through electron tunnelling process under the electrochemical polarization driving force.									9	2	0	0	0	0	9			1533-4880	1533-4899		WOS:000492366900011	31635609

However, today's development of the electrochemical NO3- reduction reaction (NO3RR) is hindered by the lack of eligible electrocatalysts and clear mechanism clarification. Here, the application potentials of the tetragonal transition-metal phosphide monolayers (M2P, M = Co, Ni, Ru and Pd) as NO3RR electrocatalysts for NH3 synthesis have been comprehensively and originally studied using density functional theory. Through comparing the relative energies of various possible products along the NO3RR process, a novel alternating pathway is proposed and it is beneficial to avoid the formation of N-containing by-products. Selecting the d-band center (epsilon(d)) as an effective descriptor, a volcano-type plot of the NO3RR limiting potential is established. The Ni2P monolayer stands near the top of the volcano plot with the limiting potential of -0.37 V, but its selectivity can be greatly reduced when applying the electrode potential. Then, a Ru-doped Co2P monolayer is constructed to modulate the epsilon(d) close to the value at the volcano top and its limiting potential is -0.38 V, exhibiting excellent activity. In addition, the Ru-doping process is thermodynamically favorable and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction is significantly suppressed even with the application of electrode potentials. This work not only provides an atomic understanding of the NO3RR process and but also offers a reliable descriptor to help design promising electrocatalysts.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000700268100001

To correctly choreograph the substrates spatially and temporally, MOs evolved a variety of strategies, which involve structural flexibility. Besides classical domain and loop movements, flavin-containing MOs feature conformational changes of their flavin prosthetic group and their nicotinamide cofactor. With similar mechanisms emerging in various subclasses, their generality and involvement in selectivity are intriguing questions. Cytochrome P450 MOs are often inherently plastic and large movements of individual segments throughout the entire structure occur. As these complicated and often unpredictable movements are largely responsible for substrate uptake, engineering strategies for these enzymes were mostly successful when randomly mutating residues across the entire structure.									19	0	0	0	12	0	19			0959-440X	1879-033X		WOS:000502884900006	30831329

This work suggests to exploit the so-called "salt effect" to improve the vapor phase oxidation method in terms of safety and flexibility. Increasing the relative volatility of acid, the addition of Mg(NO3)(2) salt to the HNO3 + H2O solution allows (i) obtaining vapors with HNO3 at the azeotropic concentration from a more diluted liquid solution ( i.e. operating under safer conditions), and (ii) varying the concentration of HNO3 in the vapor phase even above the azeotropic concentration limit ( with improved process flexibility). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy, thermo-gravimetry, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy systematic analyses are carried out on pristine and oxidized nanotubes in order to assess their functionalization degree, surface chemistry and structural evolution. The most relevant finding of this preliminary study is that the nanotube functionalization extent increases linearly with the HNO3 vapor concentration. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

The distribution of N-GQDs on the 3D MoS2-rGO framework was confirmed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray elemental mapping, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy techniques. The resultant 3D nanohybrid was successfully demonstrated as an efficient electrocatalyst toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under alkaline conditions. The chemical interaction between the electroactive N-GQDs and MoS2-rGO and the increased surface area and pore size of the N-GQDs/MoS2-rGO nanohybrid synergistically improved the ORR onset potential to +0.81 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Moreover, the N-GQDs/MoS2-rGO nanohybrid showed better ORR stability for up to 3000 cycles with negligible deviation in the half-wave potential (E-1/2). Most importantly, the N-GQDs/MoS2-rGO nanohybrid exhibited a superior methanol tolerance ability even under a high concentration of methanol (3.0 M) in alkaline medium. Hence, the development of a low-cost metal-free graphene quantum dot-based 3D nanohybrid with high methanol tolerance may open up a novel strategy to design selective cathode electrocatalysts for direct methanol fuel cell applications.									62	2	0	0	3	0	63			2470-1343			WOS:000392719300028	31457177

The electrochemical behaviour of the CoFe2O4/1 M KOH interface was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and impedance techniques. The studies allowed finding out the redox reactions occurring at the oxide surface. The results were compared with colloidal electrodes prepared by alkaline precipitation of Fe(II) or Fe(III) hydrous oxi-hydroxides on platinum electrodes. In addition, it has been concluded that the processes are diffusion-controlled and the diffusion of the hydroxide ion, through the oxide, acts as the rate-determining step. The diffusion coefficient of OH- through the oxide film was determined using cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques.									10	0	0	0	0	1	10			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000289850200013

USE - A system for providing inerting gas to a protected space for on-board systems for any type of vehicle or for on-site installation in fixed systems, such as military vehicles, heavy machinery vehicles, sea craft, ships, submarines, etc., particularly aircraft and other vehicles having fire suppression systems, emergency power systems, and other systems that may involve electrochemical systems. ADVANTAGE - The solubility of oxygen in water varies inversely with temperature, and the system can be controlled to add heat to the process water to promote dissolution and evolution of gas phase oxygen so that it can be separated and removed. The process water can be contacted with a heat source upstream of a liquid-gas separator. A separate heat source can be used, such as a heater or a heat exchanger with a heat rejection side in fluid and/or thermal communication with a heat source. The heat source can also be the electrochemical cell/stack itself. The enthalpy of the chemical reactions resulting from electrolytic generation of inert gas occurring on each side of the separator are balanced, with water molecules being split on the anode side and atoms combined to form water on the cathode side. Accordingly, the electrical energy entered into the system results in generation of heat. Disposition of the gas outlet in the flow path downstream of the cell/stack allows for heat generated by the cell/stack to promote evolution of oxygen for separation and removal from the process water. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A system for providing inerting gas to a protected space comprises electrochemical cell (10) comprising cathode (14) and anode (16) separated by a separator comprising proton transfer medium; power source arranged to provide voltage differential between anode and cathode; cathode fluid flow path (23) in operative fluid communication with cathode between cathode fluid flow path inlet and cathode fluid flow path outlet (24); anode fluid flow path (25) in operative fluid communication with anode, between an anode fluid flow path inlet and an anode fluid flow path outlet; cathode supply fluid flow path (22) between air source and cathode fluid flow path inlet, and an inerting gas flow path in operative fluid communication with cathode fluid flow path outlet and protected space; anode supply fluid flow path (22') between process water source and anode fluid flow path inlet; process water fluid flow path (26') in operative fluid communication with anode fluid flow path inlet and anode fluid flow path outlet, including gas outlet (60) that discharges gas from process water fluid flow path; and gas discharge valve (56) in fluid communication with gas outlet and operative to allow fluid communication between process water fluid flow path and discharge side of gas outlet in response to gas on process water fluid flow path, and to block fluid communication between process water fluid flow path and discharge side of gas outlet in response to a lack of gas on the process water fluid flow path.

CSM coupled to a reliable high-throughput screening assay-coefficient of variance below 10%- has been used to enhance turnover rates in the fungal laccase variant T2 from Myceliophthora thermophila. The influence of the highly conserved pentapeptide 509-513 on the redox potential of blue-copper containing enzymes is well described. We focused combinatorial saturation mutagenesis in residues Ser510 and Leu513. Libraries were constructed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by in vivo overlap extension IVOE- of the PCR products. This methodology provides a simple manner to build CSM libraries avoiding extra PCR reactions, by-products formation and in vitro ligation steps. After exploring more than 1,700 clones, mutant (7E1) with similar to 3-fold higher kinetics than parent type was found. 7E1 showed one synonymous mutation (L513L, CGT/FTG) and one beneficial mutation S510G (TCG/GGG) that can not be achieved by conventional error-prone PCR techniques. Mutation S510G seems to affect the C-terminal plug, which modulates the transit of water and oxygen to the trinuclear copper cluster.									33	0	0	0	30	0	34			1386-2073	1875-5402		WOS:000242752900001	17168677

The results of this assessment indicate that the shallow groundwater in the study area is weakly alkaline and brackish. Concentrations of K+, Cl- and NO3- are highly variable in groundwater and are the highest in areas with intensive human land use activities. The TDS content of groundwater gradually increases from the recharge area to the discharge area, and the chemical composition gradually changes from SO42--HCO3--Na+Mg2+ to SO42--Na+-Mg2+. Overall, the chemical composition and groundwater types in the study area are primarily affected by water-rock reactions, and certain areas are more affected by human activities. Isotopic evidence indicates that the main source of shallow groundwater in the study area is snowmelt.									15	1	0	0	5	0	16			1866-6280	1866-6299		WOS:000474585400003

In this work, a novel covalent organic polymer (COP)-based photocatalyst with trace ending groups was prepared by the efficient irreversible kinetic coupling reaction, i.e., nickel(0)-catalyzed Yamamoto-type Ullmann cross-coupling, using pyrene as electron donor and countpart, e.g., phenanthrolene, benzene, pyrazine, as electron acceptor. The newly developed optimal photocatalyst (termed as COP-TP3:1) has a 14-fold improvement in the H-2 evolution rate from 3 to 42 mu mol h(-1) under visible light compared with the sample without donor acceptor structure. Moreover, COP-TP3:1 also performs excellent photocatalytic activity under different water quality (deionized water, municipal water, commercial mineral water, and simulated seawater (NaCl 3 wt %)). Significantly, ignored decrease in H-2 evolution can be observed after 20 hours cycling H-2 production, and the performance is only reduced by about 7% even after discontinuous cycles of photocatalysis and storage for a month. The donor acceptor units with trace ending groups contribute to suppress electron holes recombination kinetics and the N coordination sites in electron acceptors conduce to anchor Pt (as the cocatalyst) onto the surface of photocatalyst, both of which are conducive to the outstanding photocatalytic activity and stability. Accordingly, this work can provide guidance to design a stable and efficient photocatalyst by copolymerization for visible-light-driven H-2 production.									56	1	0	0	6	0	56			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000444793000077	30125498

Part II. Hydroxylation Effects								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				112	49			19710	19717		10.1021/jp8067602				DEC 11 2008	2008	This paper deals with the assignment of photoluminescence excitation spectra of hydroxylated MgO powders thanks to a combined theoretical and experimental approach. Experimentally, despite the numerous types of hydroxyl groups formed upon hydroxylation of bare MgO surfaces, only three types of luminescent species are observed. TD-DFT excitation energy calculations are performed on hydroxylated MgO clusters modeling planes, edges, corners, kinks, and divacancies. The results indicate that the photoluminescence excitation properties do not depend primarily on the coordination of oxygen Of O(LC)H groups (LC= low coordination), which can be satisfactorily explained by theoretical calculations. The hydroxylation state of the surface can thus be more accurately followed by the thermal evolution of the bands characteristic of bare surface irregularities. In addition, O(LC)H groups are themselves directly implied in the excitation process only if they are located on convex areas of the surface and if L <= 3, L being defined as the number of magnesium neighbors. Otherwise, the observed excitation modes of OH groups rather correspond to perturbations of excitation modes of the related dehydroxylated surface. The emission process is followed experimentally by lifetime measurements, which enable one to visualize energy transfer between surface species.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			1932-7447			WOS:000261426600078

Herein, we synthesized a series of carbon-based hierarchical nanostructures through the controlled pyrolysis of Co-MOF (metal organic framework) precursors followed by in situ phosphidation. Two kinds of catalysts were prepared: metal nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanotubes, and metal nanoparticles dispersed on the carbon surface. The results proved that the metal nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanotubes exhibit enhanced ORR electrocatalytic performance, owed to the enriched catalytic sites and the mass transfer facilitating channels provided by the hierarchical porous structure of the carbon nanotubes. Furthermore, the phosphidation of the metal nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanotubes (P-Co-CNTs) increases the surface area and porosity, resulting in faster electron transfer, greater conductivity, and lower charge transfer resistance towards ORR pathways. The P-Co-CNT catalyst shows a half-wave potential of 0.887 V, a Tafel slope of 67 mV dec(-1), and robust stability, which are comparatively better than the precious metal catalyst (Pt/C). Conclusively, this study delivers a novel path for designing multiple crystal phases with improved catalytic performance for energy devices.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6				1420-3049		WOS:000726591000001	34771081

The wollastonite formed by reaction of these fluids with non-siliceous calcite marble. The skarn formed at the contact of the syenitic Diana Complex and was subsequently overprinted by Grenville-age granulite facies metamorphism and retrograde hydrothermal alteration during uplift.Calcite marbles adjacent to the deposit have generally high deltaO-18 values (c. 21 parts per thousand), typical of Grenville marbles which have not exchanged extensively with externally derived fluids. Carbon isotopic fractionations between coexisting calcite and graphite in the marbles indicate equilibration at 675-degrees-C, consistent with the conditions of regional metamorphism. Oxygen isotopic ratios from wollastonite skarn are lower than in the marbles and show a 14 parts per thousand variation (-1 parts per thousand to 13 parts per thousand). Some isotopic heterogeneity is preserved from skarn formation, and some represents localized exchange with low-deltaO-18 retrograde fluids.Detailed millimetre- to centimetre-scale isotopic profiles taken across skarn/marble contacts reveal steep deltaO-18 gradients in the skarn, with values increasing towards the marble. The gradients reflect isotopic evolution of the fluid as it reacted with high deltaO-18 calcite to form wollastonite. Calcite in the marble preserves high deltaO-18 values to within <5 mm of the skarn contact. The preservation of high deltaO-18 values in marbles at skarn contacts and the disequilibrium fractionation between wollastonite skarn and calcite marble across these contacts indicate that the marbles were not infiltrated with significant quantities of the fluid. Thus, the marbles were relatively impermeable during both the skarn formation and retrograde alteration. Skarn formation may have been episodic and fluid flow was either chaotic or dominantly parallel to lithological contacts. Although these steep isotope gradients resemble fluid infiltration fronts, they actually represent the sides of the major flow system. Because chromatographic infiltration models of mass transport require the assumption of pervasive fluid flow through a permeable rock, such models are not applicable to this hydrothermal system and, by extension, to many other metamorphic systems where low-permeability rocks restrict fluid migration pathways. Minimum time-integrated fluid fluxes have been calculated at the Valentine deposit using oxygen isotopic mass balance, reaction progress of fluid buffering reactions, and silica mass balance. All three approaches show that large volumes of fluid were necessary to produce the skarn, but silica mass balance calculations yield the largest minimum flux and are hence the most realistic.									51	0	0	0	2	0	51			0263-4929			WOS:A1994PC77100002

In this study, we provide a facile approach for the design and fabrication of efficient and stable electrocatalysts through wet chemical methods. The carbon material, obtained by the dehydration of sucrose sugar, provides high surface area for the deposition of NiO nanostructures and the resulting NiO/C catalysts show higher activity towards the OER in alkaline media. During the OER, a composite of NiO with 200 mg C can produce current densities of 10 and 20 mA cm(-2) at a bias of 1.45 V and 1.47 V vs. RHE, respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy experiments showed the lowest charge transfer resistance and the highest double layer capacitance in the case of the NiO/C composite with 200 mg C. The presence of C for the deposition of NiO nanostructures increases the active centers and consequently a robust electrocatalytic activity is achieved. The obtained results in terms of the low overpotential and small Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1) for non-precious catalysts are clear indications for the significant advancement in the field of electrocatalyst design for water splitting. This composite material based on NiO/C is simple and scalable for widespread use in various applications, especially in supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2046-2069			WOS:000459499900048	35515914

Specifications differ for these technologies to meet economic viability but state-of-the-art prototypes all rely on the powerful catalytic properties of the platinum metal as a catalyst for hydrogen production and uptake. Yet, this scarce and expensive metal is not itself a sustainable resource and its replacement by low cost and readily available materials is a requisite for these technologies to become economically viable. Here we revisit the preparation of bioinspired nanomaterials for hydrogen evolution and uptake (Le Goff et al., Science, 2009, 326, 1384-1387) and show that molecular engineering combined with three dimensional structuring of the electrode material allows the preparation of stable materials based on nickel bisdiphosphine catalytic units with performances in a 0.5 M sulphuric acid aqueous electrolyte that approach those of commercial platinum-based materials (0.05 mg(Pt) cm(-2)) assessed under similar, technologically relevant, operational conditions.									49	1	0	0	2	0	49			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000372243600023

Light absorption showed a wavelength-specific increase, especially in the acclimation to the blue parr of the spectrum. The total amount of absorbed photons was similar for blue and white light and much higher than red light treatment at the end of the experiment. The optimal quantum yield (F-v/F-m) was not affected by the treatments but under blue light photosynthetic rate (measured as O-2 evolution) was always lower in comparison with white and red light, despite the increase in absorption and photosynthesis observed after 14 days of acclimation to blue light. The operational quantum requirement for O-2 evolution (QR') was 41 mol absorbed photons mol(-1) O-2 in blue light, almost double chat of the QR' values for white and red light. The uncoupling between absorption and oxygen production seems to be located in the water hydrolysis step, since only 28 % of the excitons reaching the reaction centres promoted water hydrolysis. This is probably caused by a little overlap of photosystems II and I under blue light. However, differences in photosynthesis were not enough to explain the observed growth rates. Biomass production under blue light was much lower than under white and red light. A low efficiency in the investment of the assimilated carbon into new biomass is pointed out, since blue light-grown thalli showed high rates of organic carbon release to the external medium (up to 63 % of assimilated C, disregarding respiration), while for white and red light-grown thalli the organic carbon release accounted for about 30 %. The total amount of heterosides (floridoside, L-isofloridoside and D-isofloridoside) accumulated in the cell was 122 mu mol g(-1) dry wt. under blue light, and 385 and 447 under white and red light, respectively These concentrations correlated with growth rate. As observed with the results, the effect of white light was a combination of blue and red light. We suggest that the effect of light quality on the growth rate of P. leucosticta involves both the photosynthetic performance and the capability to maintain assimilated C inside the cell under each spectral band, and is mediated by changes in the accumulation of the main photosynthetic products, namely the heterosides.									23	9	0	0	21	2	33			0176-1617	1618-1328		WOS:000088764100014

Therefore, knowledge of the possible modes and bifurcations of electron transport that affect ROS signaling provides insight into the interrelationship of mitochondrial respiration with cellular metabolism. Here, a bifurcation analysis of a sequence of the electron transport chain models of increasing complexity was used to analyze the contribution of individual components to the modes of respiratory chain behavior. Our algorithm constructed models as large systems of ordinary differential equations describing the time evolution of the distribution of redox states of the respiratory complexes. The most complete model of the respiratory chain and linked metabolic reactions predicted that condensed mitochondria produce more ROS at low succinate concentration and less ROS at high succinate levels than swelled mitochondria. This prediction was validated by measuring ROS production under various swelling conditions. A numerical bifurcation analysis revealed qualitatively different types of multistationary behavior and sustained oscillations in the parameter space near a region that was previously found to describe the behavior of isolated mitochondria. The oscillations in transmembrane potential and ROS generation, observed in living cells were reproduced in the model that includes interaction of respiratory complexes with the reactions of TCA cycle. Whereas multistationarity is an internal characteristic of the respiratory chain, the functional link of respiration with central metabolism creates oscillations, which can be understood as a means of auto-regulation of cell metabolism.									17	0	0	0	11	0	17				1553-7358		WOS:000309510900034	23028295

This enzyme is able to catalyze the hydrolysis of the original p-nitrophenyl-sulfate (PNPS) substrate and the promiscuous p-nitrophenyl-phosphate (PNPP) one with comparable reaction kinetics. Based on the obtained results, a multistep mechanism including activation of the nucleophile, the nucleophilic attack, and the cleavage of the SO (PO) bond is proposed. Regarding the phosphate monoester, the results indicate that only some steps of the promiscuous reaction are identical to those in the native process. Differences concern mainly the last step in which the His115 residue acts as a general base to accept the proton by the O atom of the FGly51 in the PNPS, whereas in PNPP, the Asp317 protonated residue works as a general acid to deliver a proton by a water molecule to the oxygen atom of the CO bond. The shapes of the relative potential- energy surface (PES) are similar in the two examined cases but the rate-determining step is different (nucleophile attack vs. nucleophile activation). The influence of the dispersion contributions on the investigated reactions was also taken into account.									44	3	0	0	22	0	46			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000314217100040	23280779

Herein, a mesoporous NiFe-oxide nanocube (NiFe-NC) system is developed from a NiFe Prussian blue analog metal-organic framework as an efficient bifunctional catalyst for overall water-splitting. The NiFe-NCs with similar to 200 nm side length have a Ni/Fe molar ratio of 3:2 and is a composite of NiO and alpha/gamma-Fe2O3. The NCs demonstrate overpotentials of 271 and 197 mV for OER and HER, respectively, in 1 M KOH at 10 mA cm(-2), which outperform those of 339 and 347 mV for the spherical NiFe-oxide nanoparticles having a similar composition. The electrolyzer constructed using NiFe-NCs requires an impressive cell voltage of 1.67 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Along with a mesoporous structure with a broad pore size distribution, the NiFe-NCs demonstrate the qualities of a desired corrosion-resistant water-splitting catalyst with long-term stability. The exposure of active sites at the edges and vertices of the NCs was validated to play a crucial role in their overall catalytic performance.									181	11	0	0	7	0	183			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000417669300029	29115827

It is used for the production of solid (charcoal), liquid ( tar and other organics) and gaseous products. These products are of interest as they are possible alternate sources of energy. The study of pyrolysis is gaining increasing importance, as it is not only an independent process, it is also a first step in the gasification or combustion process, and has many advantages over other renewable and conventional energy sources. Studies have been conducted on pyrolysis of biomass and other substances by several researchers. The actual reaction scheme of pyrolysis of biomass is extremely complex because of the formation of over a hundred intermediate products. Mode ling of pyrolysis includes chemical kinetics model, heat transfer model and mass transfer model. Various kinetic models, heat and mass transfer models reported in the literature and our previous study are reported in the present review with experimental validations to provide the current status of the study. Plasma pyrolysis provides high temperature and high energy for reaction as the reaction sample is rapidly heated up to a high temperature. This review also covers the experimental and modeling study status of plasma-assisted pyrolysis.

JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY				124	25			7459	7471		10.1021/ja011621a				JUN 26 2002	2002	A key component required for an understanding of the mechanism of the evolution of molecular oxygen by the photosynthetic oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) in photosystem II (PS II) is the knowledge of the structures of the Mn cluster in the OEC in each of its intermediate redox states, or S-states. In this paper, we report the first detailed structural characterization using Mn extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy of the Mn cluster of the OEC in the S-0 state, which exists immediately after the release of molecular oxygen. On the basis of the EXAFS spectroscopic results, the most likely interpretation is that one of the di-mu-oxo-bridged Mn-Mn moieties in the OEC has increased in distance from 2.7 Angstrom in the dark-stable S-1 state to 2.85 Angstrom in the S-0 state. Furthermore, curve fitting of the distance heterogeneity present in the EXAFS data from the S-0 state leads to the intriguing possibility that three di-mu-oxo-bridged Mn-Mn moieties may exist in the OEC instead of the two cli-y-oxo-bridged Mn-Mn moieties that are widely used in proposed structural models for the OEC. This possibility is developed using novel structural models for the Mn cluster in the OEC which are consistent with the structural information available from EXAFS and the recent X-ray crystallographic structure of PS II at 3.8 Angstrom resolution.									152	0	0	0	62	0	152			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000176338400038	12071755

Herein, a hierarchically structured Ni-Co-P film was fabricated via a gas templating electro-deposition method. This film exhibits remarkably high catalytic performance for the HER in 1 M KOH with respective current densities of -10 and -500 mA cm(-2) at the overpotentials of -30 and -185 mV with a Tafel slope of 41 mV dec(-1). A controlled potential electrolysis experiment demonstrates that the as-prepared Ni-Co-P film is an efficient and robust catalyst with a faradaic efficiency close to 100%. Systematic characterization suggests that the unique hierarchical structure and the mutual participation of nano-sized Ni/Co based components are responsible for the high HER catalytic activity.									43	0	0	0	1	0	43			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000399390300036

The efficiency of the overall process strongly depends on the joint exploitation of good absorber domains and interfaces with minimized recombination pathways. To this end, we report on the effective coupling of thin-layer hematite with amorphous porous nickel-iron oxide catalysts prepared via pulsed laser deposition. The rational design of such composite photo electrodes leads to the formation of a functional adaptive junction, with enhanced photoanodic properties with respect to bare hematite. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy has contributed to shed light on the mechanisms of photocurrent generation, confirming the reduction of recombination pathways as the main contributor to the improved performances of the functionalized photoelectrodes. Our results highlight the importance of the amorphous catalysts' morphology, as dense and electrolyte impermeable layers hinder the pivotal charge compensation processes at the interface. The direct comparison with all-iron and all-nickel catalytic counterparts further confirms that control over the kinetics of both hole transfer and charge recombination, enabled by the adaptive junction, is key for the optimal operation of this kind of semiconductor/catalyst interfaces.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000505626900034	31797662

Here, we propose atomic Pt substitution in V2CTx MXene to modulate the electronic structure and promote catalytic activity toward HER. Pt-V2CTx exhibits high HER performance with a low overpotential of 27 mV at -10 mA cm(-2) in acidic media, comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. X-ray absorption spectroscopy and DFT calculations indicate that the Pt atoms are efficiently confined to the V vacancy sites of V2CTx , accompanied by a unique electronic structure. The atomic substitution of Pt with higher occupied d states at the Fermi energy of Pt and surface oxygen sites can significantly indicate an optimum hydrogen binding free energy (Delta G(H)*), promoting HER performance. This work introduces further prospects for developing efficient electrocatalysts by feasible electronic regulation and highly improved catalytic activity through rational atomic engineering.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000787898700003

The electro-oxidation of methanol has been studied in a three-electrode configuration for the application of such formulations in direct methanol fuel cell anodes. The presence of the additives produces an increase of catalytic activity, as a consequence of the ability of these metal oxides to form surface oxygen species which react with methanolic intermediates adsorbed on Pt. Among them, iridium oxide presents the highest catalytic enhancement. The stability of this additive has been investigated by potential cycling in 2 M methanol up to 1100 cycles in the interval 0.3-1.0 V vs. RITE. After an initial activation stage, the catalytic activity toward MOR decreases with cycles regardless the presence of the IrO2 additive, indicating no influence of the promoter on Pt-Ru degradation mechanisms. Even if the promoter enhances MOR activity, dissolution of Ru at highly positive potentials causes an irreversible damage which is not compensated by the promoter.

The results showed that the as-synthesized powders exhibited an irregular polyhedral morphology with the average particle size of 155 nm and possessed a single-crystalline structure. From a fundamental aspect, we demonstrated the molten-salt assisted formation mechanism that the molten salts could accelerate the diffusion rate of the reactants and improve the chemical reaction rate of the reactants in the system to induce the synthesis of the high-purity nanocrystalline powders. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the oxidation of the as-synthesized HfB2 powders at 773-1073 K in air was the weight gain process and the corresponding oxidation behavior followed parabolic kinetics governed by the diffusion of oxygen in the oxide layer.									31	1	0	0	0	0	31			2226-4108	2227-8508		WOS:000517849100004

One of the major synthetic targets for these reactions is the direct and selective hydroxylation of alkanes to alcohols, however, which faces many severe challenges in controlling chemoselectivity, regioselectivity and stereoselectivity. In nature, the oxidative metalloenzymes is capable of selectively catalyzing the insertion of oxygen into inert C-H bonds of alkanes, such as methane monooxygenases (MMO), soluble butane monooxygenases (sBMO), fungal peroxygenases and Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s). Among them, P450s that catalyze a variety of oxygenation reactions have attracted special attentions because of some intrinsic advantages. P450s are widely distributed in plants, animals and microorganisms and over 41000 sequences of P450 genes have been named from various databases, which enhances the potentials of P450s in developing the oxidative biocatalysts. In addition, compared with MMOs, P450s that have smaller molecule weight (similar to 45 kDa) are simple and amenable to recombinant expression and engineering. Herein, we reviewed the recent progress of alkanes hydroxylation by P450 enzymes either in its natural forms or engineered variants, as well as chemical activated systems. The related background and the catalytic mechanism of P450s for alkanes hydroxylation were firstly discussed. The representative examples by natural P450s mainly from CYP153, CYP52 and other P450 families were then outlined. The strategies of rational design and directed evolution on P450s engineering were then summarized focusing on the native/non-native alkane substrates. Three unusual strategies, including substrate engineering, decoy molecule, and dual-functional small molecule co-catalysis, were also discussed on their applications for activating P450s to hydroxylate non-native small alkanes. Finally, we perspective the challenges and solutions that faced by P450 enzymes in the development of new biocatalytic systems toward selective hydroxylation of alkanes. In conclusion, cytochrome P450 enzymes in both of their native and modified form are promising biocatalysts for alkanes hydroxylation and need further be investigated to gain the practical industrial applications.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			0567-7351			WOS:000558811500004

Herein, by means of density functional theory (DFT) computations, the catalytic performance of a series of single metal atoms supported on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) for NRR is evaluated. Among all the candidates, the Gibbs free energy change of the potential-determining step for five single-atom catalysts (SACs), namely Ti, Co, Mo, W, and Pt atoms supported on g-C3N4 monolayer, is lower than that on the Ru(0001) stepped surface. In particular, the single tungsten (W) atom anchored on g-C3N4 (W@g-C3N4) exhibits the highest catalytic activity toward NRR with a limiting potential of-0.35 V via associative enzymatic pathway, and can well suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. The high NRR activity and selectivity of W@g-C3N4 are attributed to its inherent properties, such as significant positive charge and large spin moment on the W atom, excellent electrical conductivity, and moderate adsorption strength with NRR intermediates. This work opens up a new avenue of N-2 reduction for renewable energy supplies and helps guide future development of single-atom catalysts for NRR and other related electrochemical process.									217	18	0	0	3	0	217			2366-9608			WOS:000476756200011

The aim of the research was to determine: (1) morphology in sun leaves as long term acclimation to high light; (2) short term responses to high light, i.e. during the course of the day; (3) evolution of responses during the growing season and the ageing process. Sun leaves differ from shade leaves by their lower trapping capacity (expressed by the ratio F-V/F-M) and higher capacity to reduce end acceptors beyond PSI (expressed by phase I-P of the FT). These features were assessed at pre-dawn, when the entire plant is fully dark-adapted. Short term responses (differences between midday and pre-dawn assessments) occur especially in sun leaves, indicating that the photosynthetic machinery reacts to the high excitation pressure by increasing photochemical and non-photochemical de-excitation processes. Other responses concern the inactivation of the oxygen evolving system and a stability loss of the tripartite system reaction centre (RC) - harvesting light complex - core antenna, expressed by the onset of K and L-bands at midday. Sun leaves are well acclimated to high light from a structural and functional point of view, however, the irradiance at midday provokes conditions of instability in the photosynthetic machinery, possibly through reactive oxygen species (ROS) production at both PSII and PSI sides. The temporal patterns across the growing season indicate the progression of senescence processes, that are more pronounced in sun leaves which present a permanent (chronic) condition of photoinhibition. Differences between sun and shade leaves decrease over time.									31	0	0	0	28	0	32			1126-3504	1724-5575		WOS:000310594400021

However, the internal structure evolution, the pathways and the dynamics of the proton/intercalated anion migration, as well as the functioning mechanism of Mn dopant to stabilize the layered structure during cycles remain unclear. Here, we unveil that irreversible oxidization of Mn3+ at the initial CV cycles, which will remain as Mn4+ in the NiO2 slabs after the first oxidization to effectively suppress the phase transformation from alpha-Ni(OH)(2)/gamma-NiOOH to beta-Ni (OH)(2)/beta-NiOOH and further maintain the structural integrity of electrode. With a synergistic combination of theoretical calculations and various structural probes including XRD and H-2 MAS solid state NMR, we decode the structure evolution and dynamics in the initial CV (cyclic voltammetry) cycles, including the absorption/desorption of hydrogen containing species, migration of intercalated anions/water molecules and the change of interlayer space. This present work elucidates a close relationship between doping chemistry and structural reliability, paving a novel way of reengineering supercapacitor electrode materials.

Electroreforming of organic substances such as methanol to generate hydrogen has been considered an innovative strategy. Herein, graphene (G) supported Pd-3-Co-1(Pd-3-Co(1/)G) catalyst was synthesized and employed as cathode catalyst to facilitate hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the electrochemical methanol reformation (ECMR) process. The structural characteristics of synthesized Pd-3-Co-1/G were determined by FE-SEM, HR- LEM, EDX, XRD, FT-IR, UV, XPS, and ICP-OES techniques. Furthermore, the electrocatalytic behavior of the proposed catalyst was evaluated by CV, LSV and EIS techniques in 0.5 M H2SO4. Electrochemical studies revealed that Pd-3-Co-1/G exhibited a large electrochemically active surface area (120 m(2) g(-1)), good long-term stability, low Tafel slope value (46 mV dec(-1)) and small WI value (12 Omega). The practical utility of the developed catalyst towards hydrogen production in ECMR cell was tested at various experimental conditions using membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) which were prepared using commercial Pt-Ru/C as anode and Pd-3-Co-1/G as cathode electrocatalysts respectively. The synthesized Pd-3-Co-1/G electrocatalyst exhibited superior cell performance for 50 h at 60 degrees C cell temperature with a cell voltage and current density of 058 V and 150 mAcm(-2), respectively. The improvement in electrocatalytic activity could be attributed to alloying Pd with Co and the use of G as carbon support, which in turn enhanced the HER activity of Pd. Hence, the prepared Pd-3-Co(1/)G can be used as an alternative to cathode electrocatalyst for HER in ECMR cells.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1040-0397	1521-4109		WOS:000771001100001

This study is to utilize the biomass of soybean straw as the supporting carbon materials to prepare nitrogen and cobalt dual-doped porous biocarbon electrocatalysts (CoNASS) possessing high content of N (1.92%), embedding cobalt nanoparticles and sponge-like structure with high specific surface area (1185.00 m(2) g(-1)) as well as appropriate pore diameter (similar to 2.17 nm). Meantime, CoNASS exhibits a good electrocatalytic activity with a half-wave potential of 0.786 V (vs. RHE), comparable to a half-wave potential of 0.827 V (vs. RHE) for the commercial Pt/C. The detections of electrochemical kinetics show the electron transfer number of CoNASS is in the range of 3.84-3.92, which indicates 4-electron pathway dominantly occurs in ORR. And the limiting diffusion current density of CoNASS at 1600 rpm is around 5.8 mA cm(-2) slightly higher than that of the benchmark Pt/C (5.6 mA cm(-2)). This work opens a new avenue to utilize soybean straw, one of agriculture waste of large quantity, to prepare high efficient and low-cost catalysts for ORR.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2046-2069			WOS:000459183800022	35514627

It has been shown that SCS temperature and composition of the products are governed by changing the AHM-organic fuel ratio, the type of organic reducer, the rate of gaseous oxygen flow, and quantity of ammonium nitrate. A solution combustion synthesis method allowed to produce molybdenum carbide at the first stage only from the AHM-glycine system. In the other studied systems, carburization process was stimulated by the subsequent programmed heating of the SCS product, sometimes with addition of a certain amount of carbon source up to 1200 degrees C with V-h = 20-100 degrees min(-1). The catalytic activity and selectivity of Mo2C was tested on the model reaction of isopropyl alcohol conversion. A new phenomenon showing the temperature influence on the selectivity of either propylene or acetone formation was revealed.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000441513200002

Possible mechanisms of water oxidation in oxygen evolving complex of photosystem II								MOLECULAR PHYSICS				116	5-6	SI		717	745		10.1080/00268976.2018.1428375				2018	2018	Possible mechanisms for water cleavage in oxygen evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II (PSII) have been investigated based on broken-symmetry (BS) hybrid DFT (HDFT)/def2 TZVP calculations in combination with available XRD, XFEL, EXAFS, XES and EPR results. The BS HDFT and the experimental results have provided basic concepts for understanding of chemical bonds of the CaMn4O5 cluster in the catalytic site of OEC of PSII for elucidation of the mechanism of photosynthetic water cleavage. Scope and applicability of the hybrid DFT (HDFT) methods have been examined in relation to relative stabilities of possible nine intermediates such as Mn-hydroxide, Mn-oxo, Mn-peroxo, Mn-superoxo, etc., in order to understand the O-O (O-OH) bond formation in the S-3 and/or S-4 states of OEC of PSII. The relative stabilities among these intermediates are variable, depending on the weight of the Hartree-Fock exchange term of HDFT. The Mn-hydroxide, Mn-oxo and Mn-superoxo intermediates are found to be preferable in the weak, intermediate and strong electron correlation regimes, respectively. Recent different serial femtosecond X-ray (SFX) results in the S-3 state are investigated based on the proposed basic concepts under the assumption of different water-insertion steps for water cleavage in the Kok cycle. The observation of water insertion in the S-3 state is compatible with previous large-scale QM/MM results and previous theoretical proposal for the chemical equilibrium mechanism in the S-3 state . On the other hand, the no detection of water insertion in the S-3 state based on other SFX results is consistent with previous proposal of the O-OH (or O-O) bond formation in the S-4 state . Radical coupling and non-adiabatic one-electron transfer (NA-OET) mechanisms for the OO-bond formation are examined using the energy diagrams by QM calculations and by QM(UB3LYP)/MM calculations . Possible reaction pathways for the O-O and O-OH bond formations are also investigated based on two water-inlet pathways for oxygen evolution in OEC of PSII. Future perspectives are discussed in relation to post HDFT calculations of the energy diagrams for elucidation of the mechanism of water oxidation in OEC of PSII.[GRAPHICS].									24	0	0	0	7	0	24			0026-8976	1362-3028		WOS:000425786100016

Despite extensive effort, it remains unclear whether PTDH catalysis proceeds via an associative or dissociative mechanism. Here, primary H-2 and secondary O-18 kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) were determined and used together with computation to characterize the transition state (TS) catalyzed by a thermostable PTDH (17X-PTDH). The large, normal O-18 KIEs suggest an associative mechanism. Various transition state structures were computed within a model of the enzyme active site and H-2 and O-18 KIEs were predicted to evaluate the accuracy of each TS. This analysis suggests that 17X-PTDH catalyzes an associative process with little leaving group displacement and extensive nucleophilic participation. This tight TS is likely a consequence of the extremely poor leaving group requiring significant P-O bond formation to expel the hydride. This finding contrasts with the dissociative TSs in most phosphoryl transfer reactions from phosphate mono- and diesters.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000454751800002	30525552

For quenched films of 2 mu m thickness, the data indicate a low density of c-axis nuclei near the substrate, apparently due to a reduced oxygen concentration deep inside the precursor layer. Significant non c-axis growth was also observed; the majority of this material nucleates away from the substrate.

J	de Wijn, R; van Gorkom, HJ								S-state dependence of the miss probability in Photosystem II								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				72	2			217	222		10.1023/A:1016128632704				2002	2002	The oxygen production of dark-adapted Photosystem II upon illumination by a series of single-turnover flashes shows a damped period four oscillation with flash number. The damping is attributed to 'misses' resulting from a statistical probability that a reaction center fails to produce a stable charge separation after a saturating flash. The origin of misses is of interest because its probable dependence on flash number, in principle, affects the quantitative interpretation of all measurements on phenomena associated with the period four oscillation. We show that the kinetics of chlorophyll fluorescence yield transients induced by a flash series can be used to estimate the relative amplitudes of the miss probability on each flash. It is concluded that a major part of the misses must be caused by failure of the reduction of the oxidized primary electron donor chlorophyll P680(+) by the secondary donor tyrosine Y-Z before the charge separation is lost by recombination. The probability of this failure is found to increase with the oxidation state of the oxygen-evolving complex: more than half of it occurs upon charge separation in the S-3 state, which is attributed to the presence of Y-Z(ox) S-2 in Boltzmann equilibrium with YZS3.									34	0	0	0	26	0	34			0166-8595			WOS:000176760200009	16228520

Herein, for the first time, a facet junction engineered hexagonal CdS single crystal with exposing {0001} and {10 (1) over bar0} facets was synthesized by hydrothermal reaction via adjusting the molar ratio of S2-/Cd2+ precursor. The co-exposed {0001} and {10 (1) over bar0} facets on hexagonal CdS single crystals with continuous band bending and well-defined epitaxial interfaces showed highly efficient visible-light-induced H-2 evolution. The maximum photocatalytic H-2 production rate of 24.33 mmol h(-1) g(-1) is obtained over the facet-junction engineered hexagonal CdS-5 single crystals with an apparent quantum efficiency of 11.18% at 470 nm, which is about 5.27 times greater than CdS-1 nanoparticles. Also, superior photostability is also achieved, even after 25 consecutive cycles during 100 h light irradiation keeping impregnated in strong alkaline sacrificial agent beyond 20 days, the initial photoactivity is still remained. The enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution activity and photostability can be ascribed to the type-II band alignment between the co-exposed {0001} and {10 (1) over bar0} facets that significantly promoted the separation rate of photo-generated electrons and holes. And the small amount of sulfur vacancies are also benefit for the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of CdS-5. The time-resolved fluorescence (TRPL) decay and photoelectrochemical test further proved the effective spatial charge separation. This work provides a feasible and simple strategy for designing of facet-junction engineered CdS single crystals with highly efficient photocatalytic activity and unprecedented photostability.									67	3	0	0	5	0	68			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000457952600071

In this study, we investigated the reactivity of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) for activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to decompose diverse organic contaminants. Cu2O exhibited a strong catalytic dependence on the crystal morphology, and cubic Cu2O was more reactive than the octahedral and rhombic dodecahedral structures for catalytic degradation of bisphenol A with PMS. Chemical quenching tests, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), solvent exchange and selective oxidation experiment were corporately conducted to illustrate that Cu2O-catalyzed PMS did not produce free radicals or singlet oxygen. In contrast, a surface-confined metastable intermediate would be formed via outer-sphere interactions between PMS and Cu2O, which directly attacked the organic substrate. Such a reaction pathway is intrinsically distinct from the electron-shuttling regime in carbon (or noble metal)/persulfate systems via the conductive surface of the catalyst, and the outer-sphere interactions let the activated PMS demonstrate a higher oxidizing capacity toward organic contaminants. Therefore, this study dedicates to providing new insights into the copper-catalyzed AOPs and vital supplementary to the ongoing dialogue of the nonradical catalysis in persulfate-based oxidation.									59	1	0	0	28	0	60			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000509618300013	31704121

In this composite material, Cu2O particles with a size of about 6-10 nm were dispersed evenly in the nitrogen doped carbon matrix. After calcination, some coordinated nitrogen atoms were doped in the lattice of Cu2O and replace oxygen atoms, thus generating a large number of oxygen vacancies. In Cu/Cu2O@NC, the existence of oxygen vacancies has been confirmed by electron spin resonance (ESR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Under visible light irradiation, Cu/Cu2O@NC exhibits excellent H-2 production with the rate of 379.6 mu mol h(-1) g(-1). Its photocatalytic activity affects organic dyes, such as Rhodamine B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO). In addition to photocatalysis, Cu/Cu2O@NC also exhibits striking catalytic activity in reductive conversion of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol with in presence of sodium borohydride (NaBH4). The conversion efficiency reaches almost 100% in 250 s with the quantity of Cu/Cu2O@NC as low as 5 mg. The outstanding H-2 production and organic pollutants removal are attributed to the oxygen vacancy. We expect that Cu/Cu2O@NC will find its way as a new resource for hydrogen energy as well as a promising material in water purification.									33	3	0	0	1	0	34			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000424226200034	29349461

At low metallicity, our simulations confirm that the deuterium abundance is very close to the primordial value. The chemical evolution of the deuterium abundance that we derive here agrees quantitatively with analytical chemical evolution models. We furthermore find that the relation between the deuterium and oxygen abundance exhibits very little scatter. We compare our simulations to existing high-redshift observations in order to determine a primordial deuterium fraction of (2.549 +/- 0.033) x 10(-5) and stress that future observations at higher metallicity can also be used to constrain this value. At fixed metallicity, the deuterium fraction decreases slightly with decreasing redshift, due to the increased importance of mass-loss from intermediate-mass stars. We find that the evolution of the average deuterium fraction in a galaxy correlates with its star formation history. Our simulations are consistent with observations of the Milky Way's interstellar medium (ISM): the deuterium fraction at the solar circle is 85-92 per cent of the primordial deuterium fraction. We use our simulations to make predictions for future observations. In particular, the deuterium abundance is lower at smaller galactocentric radii and in higher mass galaxies, showing that stellar mass loss is more important for fuelling star formation in these regimes (and can even dominate). Gas accreting on to galaxies has a deuterium fraction above that of the galaxies' ISM, but below the primordial fraction, because it is a mix of gas accreting from the intergalactic medium and gas previously ejected or stripped from galaxies.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000432660300007

At early times (50-mu-s), the optical absorption spectra confirm the presence of the primary intermediate (I(m)). This intermediate has an Fe-O2 stretching mode in the resonance Raman spectrum at 568 cm-1 that was used as a marker for its population. By following the change in intensity of this mode, the first-order rate constant for the decay of I(m) was measured to be 4.5 X 10(3) s-1. The formation of the next intermediate (II(m)) of the enzyme with a 607-nm peak in the optical absorption difference spectrum was monitored by its optical absorption spectrum and displays a first-order rate constant for its formation, which is the same as the rate constant for the decay I(m). The resonance Raman spectrum of I(m) and II(m) are nearly identical, indicating the the pi-electron depletion of the porphyrin macrocycle in cytochrome a3 is the same for these two intermediates. The absorption spectrum and the resonance Raman spectrum of an intermediate formed by mixing oxygen with CO-bound mixed-valence cytochrome c oxidase and allowing O2 to spontaneously replace CO are the same as those of II(m) formed in the photolysis experiments. II(m), formed in this way, decays biphasically to the resting form of the enzyme.									39	0	0	0	26	0	39			0002-7863			WOS:A1990EQ05100001

In this environment, the low metabolic demand and the high oxygen concentration reduce the need for hemoglobin(s) [Hb(s)]. The extreme condition is represented by the icefish (Channichthyidae, Notothenioidei), the only vertebrates that lack Hb. We obtained the nucleotide sequence coding for the beta-globin chain of the single major Hb form in six red-blooded notothenioids. These included Gymnodraco acuticeps, one of the closest species to the Hb-less icefish, which is also the only known fish having a single Hb without Bohr effect. This species shows a higher rate of nonsynonymous substitutions (K-A), in contrast with the homogeneity of synonymous substitution (K-S) rates, and K-A/K-S ratios significantly greater than one in the majority of comparisons. These results are suggestive of positive selection, diversifying the single major Hb toward specialized functions. A single Hb that is free to diversify means that its role in routine oxygen transport can be reduced in the presence of a combination of physiological, ecological, and environmental factors. Although a reduced "routine" function for Hb, as is apparent in G. acuticeps, might, indeed, evoke the lack of Hb in icefish, evidence of diversifying selection reported here is at variance with the hypothesis of a simple trend from a single Hb toward the Hb-less condition.									41	0	1	0	36	0	48			0027-8424			WOS:000075143900047	9671736

The target TiO2 coatings were fabricated using the prepared Ti coatings by a heat treatment process involving pretreatment in carbon powder, followed by oxidation in air, and reduction in carbon powder. The results show that Ti2CO coatings are formed and micro-cracks appear in the surface of the coatings during pretreatment. The Ti2CO coatings and micro-cracks are beneficial for forming rutile TiO2 coatings with nano-fiber morphology during subsequent oxidation. During reduction, oxygen vacancies, which promote the narrowing of band gap, are generated in the lattice of rutile TiO2. The visible-light photocatalytic activity of the target TiO2 coatings is effectively enhanced more than 8 times, compared with the TiO2 coatings prepared solely by oxidation of Ti coatings. The ability to fabricate highly visible-light photoactive TiO2 materials by simple and safe heat treatment in carbon powder opens up new opportunities in various areas, such as the preparation of powders, nanowires, films.

Observation of palisades is considered as a clinical indicator of the transition from a noninvasive to an invasive tumour. In this paper we propose a computational model to study the influence of the hypoxic switch in palisade formation. For this we produced three-dimensional realistic simulations, based on a multiscale hybrid model, coupling the evolution of tumour cells and the oxygen diffusion in tissue, that depict the shape of palisades during its formation. Our results can be summarized as follows: (1) the presented simulations can provide clinicians and biologists with a better understanding of three-dimensional structure of palisades as well as of glioblastomas growth dynamics; (2) we show that heterogeneity in cell response to hypoxia is a relevant factor in palisade and pseudopalisade formation; (3) we show how selective processes based on the hypoxia switch influence the tumour proliferation.

The results revealed that the effects of heat stress on PSII were characterised by two distinct domains of temperatures: moderately elevated temperatures (30-37.5 degrees C) and severely elevated temperatures (higher than 37.5 degrees C). In moderately elevated temperatures, no changes in the maximal efficiency of PSII photochemistry (F-v/F-m) and photochemical quenching (q(P)) were observed. The decrease in the quantum yield of PSII electron transport (Phi(PSII)) and the efficiency of excitation energy capture by open PSII reaction centers (F-v'/F-m') was reversible and was due to a significant increase in non-photochemical quenching (q(N)). In severely elevated temperatures, the further decrease in Phi(PSII) and F-v'/F-m' was irreversible and was associated with a decrease in F-v/F-m, which was a result of the decrease in the oxygen-evolving complex activity and of an inhibition of electron transport at the acceptor side of PSII. Our results suggest that heat stress displayed multiple effects on PSII. The following sequential events leading to an inhibition of PSII electron transport in the descending order of sensitivity to heat stress can be proposed: excitation energy capture by open PSII reaction centers --> the oxygen-evolving complex of PSII --> the acceptor side of PSII.									52	21	0	0	54	0	74			0176-1617			WOS:000085757500018

However, templates are commonly utilized for the preparation of HPCs, and the postremoval of the templates is uneconomical, time-consuming, and harmful for the environment in most cases. Herein, a new humidity-induced nontemplating strategy is developed to prepare 1D HPC with rich topologies and interconnected cavities for catalysis and energy storage applications. Porous electrospun nanofibers as calcination precursors are prepared via a humidity-induced phase separation strategy. A nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon nanofiber (HPCNF), loading Co/Co3O4 hetero-nanoparticles as exemplary nonprecious-metal active substance (Co/Co3O4@HPCNF), is fabricated through the subsequent hydrothermal and pyrolysis treatment. The internal mesopore and cavity structure can be simply controlled by varying environment humidity during the electrospinning process. Benefiting from the unique topology, Co/Co3O4@HPCNF exhibits superior bifunctional activity when being used as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions. Moreover, the hybrid catalyst also demonstrates a remarkable power density of 102.5 mW cm(-2), a high capacity of 748.5 mAh g(Zn)(-1), and long cycle life in Zinc-air batteries. The developed approach offers a facile template-free route for the preparation of HPCNF hybrid and can be extended to other members of the large polymer family for catalyst design and energy storage applications.									28	3	0	0	2	0	28			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000532531100001	32406150

Here, 3D hierarchically assembled lotus shaped porous MnO2 is synthesized using a simple aqueous solution based chelating agent (citric acid) mediated growth of MnCO3 followed by calcination at 350 degrees C. MnCO3 in other shapes, such as rods, spheres and nano-aggregates, is also synthesized just by varying the chelating agents. It is observed that the geometry and strength of the chelating ligands has a crucial role in the controlled shape selective synthesis and based on this a probable chelating agent driven formation mechanism is discussed. The synthesized porous MnO2 shapes exhibit excellent shape dependent catalytic oxidation of alpha-pinene to verbenone using molecular oxygen as the oxidant. The lotus shaped porous MnO2 shows superior activity, with 94% conversion of alpha-pinene and 87% selectivity of verbenone, to that of other MnO2 shapes. The activity is reasonably high compared to heterogeneous as well as homogeneous catalysts reported in the literature and bulk MnO2 with respect to both their conversion and selectivity. The synthesized lotus shaped MnO2 also showed good catalytic activity towards oxidation of allylic compounds to corresponding ene-ones using molecular oxygen as oxidant and is reusable.									61	0	0	0	2	0	62			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000323132700025

Here, novel visible-light-driven MoS2/SnNb2O6 2D/2D nanosheet heterojunction for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was designed and fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method. The as-prepared 2D/2D heterojunctions not only offer extended visible light absorption range but also accelerate the separation and transfer efficiency of charge carriers owing to the typical 2D interface. Therefore, the MoS2/SnNb2O6 2D/2D heterojunctions showed superior H-2 evolution photocatalytic performance compared with bare MoS2 and SnNb2O6 nanosheet. The optimal H-2 production rate of as-prepared MoS2/SnNb2O6 heterojunction was up to 4.3-fold and 5-fold as high as that of bare SnNb2O6 and MoS2. This works will provide a new perspective on the development of 2D/2D nanosheet heterojunction photocatalysts with high performance for water splitting. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) data showed a single, alpha-Ag2S (acanthite), crystalline phase present while surface and bulk chemical analyses, performed using X-ray photoelectron (XPS) and energy dispersive (EDS) spectroscopies, showed 2:1 Ag:S ratio. Direct and indirect bandgaps obtained from Tauc plots were 1.3 and 2.3 eV, respectively. Detailed surface chemical analysis showed the presence of three distinct sulfur species with majority component due to the Ag2S chemical bonds and minority components due to two types of oxygen-sulfur bonds. Conductivity of the resulting composite material was shown to change with the reaction time thus enabling to obtain controlled conductivity composite material. The synthesis method presented is based on the low solubility of Ag2S and is potentially green, no by-product producing, as all Ag2S nucleated outside the host material can be recycled into the process via dissolving it in HNO3.

Competing by two rare-earths the A-site, La(2-x)Lux(Z)r(2)O(7) ceramics were found transparent only in porefree microstructures with similar grain sizes of pyrochlore (PY) and defective fluorite (DF) phases. Mutual solubilities of Lu and La in both phases were found by imaging and energy-dispersive spectroscopy analysis in scanning electron microscope. The dual-phase microstructures were developed with liquid-phase resulted from the exothermal reactions, creating a miscibility gap between two structures to moderate their competing grain growth. Change in grain growth behaviors in liquid-phase is described by a nucleation line in La2Zr2O7-Lu2Zr2O7 phase diagram. Variations of solution levels in DF grains and co-existing of dual-phase grain clusters in common orientation were revealed in transparent ceramics by electron backscattered diffraction, resulted by epitaxial relation of two phases promoted by the liquid-phase. Oxygen vacancies and various hole states common in both phases were revealed by characteristic cathodoluminescence peaks. The collective effects of pores, phase and grain boundaries, oxygen vacancies on scattering or absorption of visible light enables to establish a hierarchical microstructure. transparency relationship in such complex oxide ceramics, which could be tailored or further optimized by controllable sintering.

Appropriate catalytic materials are needed to minimize the energy required to electrochemically split the water molecule, and electrode with high specific areas are sought to maximize the electrolyte/electrode interface. We use Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) bundles as templates for water splitting electrodes fabrication. Appropriate catalyst materials are thermally evaporated on CNTs, to exploit both their good electrical conductivity and large specific area, while optimizing over-potential towards Hydrogen Evolving Reaction (HER) or Oxygen Evolving Reaction (OER) through the deposited catalysts. Electrodes morphology and surface chemistry are characterized, before and after electrolysis, by means of scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Our electrodes are able to perform water oxidation and water reduction near their thermodynamical limit. Performances of these electrodes, taking into account the extremely low loading mass of catalytic material (10(-2) mg cm(-2)) with respect to other reported systems, are among the best HER and OER system reported so far. Finally, a working electrolyser, capable to operate at the interesting low voltage of a single AA battery (1.5 V) and output a stable current (>2.0 mA cm(-2)) for at least 20 h, is successfully assembled and tested.

The evolution of AlOX, on the CH3-SAMs was studied by comparing with that on hydrophilic OH-terminated silicon dioxide (OH-SiO2) The AlOx grown on the CH3-SAM surfaces underwent growth instability and developed significantly rough surface morphologies while the AlOx on the OH-SiO2 maintained atomically smooth surface morphologies. The structural integrity of the CH3-SAMs was also found to be disturbed substantially at the onset of the ALD process with H2O. In order to improve the surface morphology of AlOx, on CH3-SAM surfaces, a two-stage ALD process was developed. In the two-stage ALD process for AlOx the first stage utilized n-propanol as the oxygen source and the second stage proceeded with H2O. The optimized two-stage ALD process significantly improved the surface morphology of AlOx films and effectively protected the structural integrity of underlying CH3-SAMs.					World Congress on Engineering and Computer Science (WCECS 2007)World Congress on Engineering and Computer Science (WCECS 2007)	OCT 24-26, 2007OCT 24-26, 2007	Int Assoc EngineersInt Assoc Engineers	San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA	1	0	0	0	0	0	1					978-988-98671-6-4	WOS:000253617900008

The Various stages in the evolution of the final catalyst from the initially deposited precursor were successfully imaged. It is found that the structure of the alumina substrate exerts a dramatic influence on the structure and stability of the silver deposit. On Al2O3(0001), sintering in I bar oxygen at 780 K causes a quasi-2D network of metallic Ag to collapse to large well-formed hemispherical particles on the bare oxide surface. On Al2O3(11 (2) over bar 0), precursor decomposition leads initially to the formation of quasi-1D Ag nanowires that decorate the faceted step edges and extend for many hundreds of nanometres. This is entirely different from the behaviour of vacuum-deposited Ag. These nanowires are much more stable against sintering in 1 bar oxygen at 780 K. Their formation and stability suggest a particularly favourable wetting interaction between Ag and the (1 (1) over bar 02) plane of alpha-alumina. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The morphology evolution of Co3O4 nanostructures which depends upon the reaction time, with and without CTAB or NH4F is investigated in detail, which is used to further demonstrate the growth mechanism of Co3O4 nanoarrays with different morphologies. CO is chosen as a probe molecule to evaluate the catalytic performance over the synthesized Co-based oxide catalysts, and the effect of morphological transformation on the catalytic activity is further confirmed via using TEM, H-2-TPR, XPS, Raman spectroscopy and in situ Raman spectroscopy. As a proof of concept application, core-shell Co3O4 NAs-8 presenting hierarchical nanosheets@nanoneedle arrays with a low density of nanoneedles exhibits the highest catalytic activity and long-term stability due to its low-temperature reducibility, the lattice distortion of the spinel structure and the abundance of surface-adsorbed oxygen (O-ads). It is confirmed that CO oxidation on the surface of Co3O4 can proceed through the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism via using in situ Raman spectroscopy. It is expected that the in situ synthesis of well-defined Co3O4 monolithic catalysts can be extended to the development of environmentally-friendly and highly active integral materials for practical industrial catalysis.									56	4	0	0	7	0	57			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000431030000049	29658017

These groundwaters, along with fresh to brackish meteoric ground and surface waters from the BMC, have been analyzed to determine their major, trace element and stable isotopic (0, H, C, and B) compositions. Saline groundwaters (total dissolved solids = 22-45 g/L) are characterized by relatively high Na/Ca ratios compared to brines from the Canadian Shield and low Na/Cl-molar and delta B-11 isotopic compositions (-2.5%(o) to 11.1%(o)) compared to seawater. Although saline waters from the Canadian Shield commonly have oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions that plot to the left of the global meteoric water line, those from the BMC fall close to the water line. Fracture and vein carbonate minerals at the Restigouche deposit have restricted carbon isotopic compositions of around -5%(o) to -6%(o). The carbon isotopic compositions of the saline waters at the Restigouche deposit (+12%(o) delta C-13(DIC)) are the result of fractionation of dissolved inorganic carbon by methanogenesis. We suggest that, unlike previous models for shield brines, the composition of saline waters in the BMC is best explained by prolonged water-rock reaction, with no requirement of precursor seawater. We suggest that elevated Br/Cl ratios of saline waters compared to seawater may be explained by differential uptake of Br and Cl during groundwater evolution through water-rock reaction.

Manganese-bearing skarn minerals are common within the deposit. The ore-forming process can be divided into five stages: Prograde skarn stage (I), retrograde skarn stage (II), oxide stage (III), quartz-sulfide stage (IV), and carbonate stage (V), with this evolution being typical of Fe skarns. Magnetite, which formed mainly during the retrograde skarn and oxide stages, includes banded (BO), disseminated (DO), and massive (MO) magnetite. Backscattered-electron images indicate that magnetite within the massive ores can be further classified as primary (MO-1) and secondary (MO-2) magnetite.Magnetite within all ore types exhibits a strongly negative correlation between Si and Fe3+ contents, indicating that Si was incorporated into intra-crystalline sites of magnetite by substitution of Si4+ for Fe3+. Positive correlation among Al, Mn, Mg, and Si contents indicate that these elements behaved similarly during magnetite formation. The delta O-18(V-SMOW) values of MO-1 magnetite range from 4.3 parts per thousand to 4.7 parts per thousand, higher than magmatic magnetite (1 parts per thousand-4 parts per thousand), while the BO and DO magnetite have lower delta O-18(V-SMOW) values of 1.7 parts per thousand to 2.4 parts per thousand and 1.8 parts per thousand to 2.5 parts per thousand respectively. Its anomalous oxygen isotopic composition indicates that most magnetite in the Akesayi Fe deposit precipitated from evolved ore-forming fluids formed by reaction between country rocks and primary magmatic fluids during the early stages of mineralization, with input from meteoric water during the later stages of mineralization. Trace-element patterns indicate that the different types of magnetite share a common source, with variations in the magnetite geochemistry amongst the different ore types of the Akesayi Fe deposit reflecting variations in the extent of fluid-rock interaction, dissolution-reprecipitation, mineral precipitation, temperature, and oxygen fugacity (fO(2)). The different types of magnetite of the Akesayi skarn Fe deposit form distinguishable populations in (Ca + Al + Mn)-(Ti + V) and (Ni/(Cr + Mn))-(Ti + V) discrimination diagrams, with the range of compositions possibly indicating more variable magnetite compositions in skarn deposits than previously thought.									3	2	0	0	0	0	4			0169-1368	1872-7360		WOS:000612803900002

The as synthesized mesoporous mesoporous La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 nanowires with relatively high oxygen vacancy concentration and ratio of Mn4+/Mn3+ show high specific surface area of 31.03 m(2) g(-1), higher than the most of reported perovskite oxides. More importantly, more catalytic active sites can be exposed at the three-phase interface of ORR due to high specific surface area. The mesoporous mesoporous La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 nanowires exhibit high half-wave potential and catalyze near 4 e(-) ORR process. Besides, the one-dimensional mesoporous mesoporous La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 -based Zn-air batteries show high peak power density of 113.86 mW cm(-2). Simultaneously, density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that strengthened electrocatalytic mechanism of La1-xSrxMnO3 catalysts originates from lower formation energy of oxygen vacancy and more positive O 2p band center because of Sr dopants, which is consistent with the experimental results. Consequently, this investigation not only provide a new idea for developing mesoporous perovskite oxides nanowires but also reveals enhanced electrocatalytic mechanism of La1-xSrxMnO3 catalysts.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000595342400005

These synthesized microgel is simultaneously used as a soft template and phosphorus dopant to fabricate nitrogen, phosphorus co-doped mesoporous graphene framework (NP-PG) via a facile hydrothermal process containing graphene oxide and ammonia. Self-assembly of graphene oxide sheets and microgels induced by their electrostatic interaction enable a tight contact between them, which would confine the phosphorus doping mostly in the pore walls. The obtained NP-PG, as a metal-free electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction, shows a comparable electrocatalytic activity to commercial Pt/C catalyst with a peak potential of -0.18 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and long-term durability. Additionally, it can also be used as a supercapacitor electrode to achieve a high specific capacitance of 245 F g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) and 95% of capacitance retention even after 3000 cycles at 5 A g(-1).

Its high transmittance, low thermal expansion, ease of polishing and relative availability make it a perfect candidate for use at 157-nm for photomasks and potentially for other short wavelength optical elements.In the course of investigating composition-property relationships of F-doped, dry silica glasses, the effect of fluorine concentration on color center formation as a function of excimer laser exposure was considered. A series of glasses with fluorine concentrations from 0 to 1.8 wt% was studied.Using the 157-nm exposure wavelength, all glasses developed the silicon E' center, characterized by its absorption at 215-nm. Also noted was the non-bridging oxygen hole center (NBOHC) which appears in the UV at 260-nm. A band at 165-nm, identified as the oxygen deficient center (ODC) was also observed. This band was most pronounced in higher F concentration glasses, with the lowest F and non-F containing glasses showing no 165-nm band evolved. The assignment of the ODC is based on the fluorescence of the center and its reaction with oxygen, which causes diminishment of the band.The evolution of the color center formation (absorption) can limit the lifetime of optics by driving down transmission with use. For the 157-nm wavelength the absorption of importance is the one that appears at the 165-nm, the ODC. The exact atomic structure of the ODC is not important for this discussion; in fact, the defect is described by two different structures, the metal-metal bond and the divalent silicon:(O)(3)Si-Si(O)(3) and O-Si-O(2+)The ODC has significant absorption at 157-nm and so minimizing its formation during exposure would be advantageous for optics life.

Molten salt CO2 capture and electrochemical transformation (MSCC-ET) process is a desirable method due to a high CO2 solubility, a wide potential window of molten salts and easily-controlled electrode reactions. Generally, electro-splitting CO2 in molten salts begins with CO2 absorption reactions to form CO32-, which is then followed by the carbon deposition at the cathode and O-2 evolution at the anode. As a result, CO2 is electro-converted to O-2 and carbon with different morphologies, compositions, microstructures and functional properties. This report introduces the MSCC-ET process, summarizes the reactions occurring in the molten salts and at the electrode surfaces, as well as the morphological variations of the cathodic products. The inert anode materials, cost estimation and scale-up evaluation of the process are then discussed. It is presumed that with a comprehensive understanding of the electrode reactions during electrolysis and the functional properties of carbon materials obtained during CO2 electro-splitting can provide a foundation for further developing this environmentally friendly process.

Here we present a geophysical approach based on field data and joint geophysical-petrological modelling to quantify the average rate of metamorphic transformations at the 10-100-kilometre and million-year scales. The model simulates the eclogitization of Indian lower crust as it penetrates beneath southern Tibet. Metamorphic transformation of the lower crust is tracked by its densification, the effect of which is then compared to observed gravity anomalies. From the modelling we find that the Indian lower crust's overall densification requires a partially hydrated initial composition. Moreover, the modelled evolution of this densification compared to what is predicted by pressure-temperature-density grids is consistent with delayed, far-from-equilibrium metamorphism. The Indian lower crust descends underneath the Himalaya until beneath southern Tibet in a thermodynamically metastable state until the first dehydration reactions are reached. This observation is used to determine the average rate of metastable rock transformation to an eclogite facies assemblage, constrained at between similar to 6 x 10(-9) and 5 x 10(-7) g/cm(2)/year, and reaction affinity at 0.8-1.6 kJ/mol oxygen. Compared to field and laboratory data, this range of results matches the effective rates typically associated with regional metamorphism. This fit and correlation across the scales legitimates the use of transformation rates determined at small scales in large-scale geodynamic studies.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0263-4929	1525-1314		WOS:000647853500001

Metal-free graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is an efficient visible-light-driven photocatalytic material. In this study, a kind of narrow-band-gap g-C3N4 has been synthesized at high synthesis temperature under hydrogen argon mixture. And then a two-step method of ultrasonication and calcination treatment was used to synthesize ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets with much bigger specific surface area. The results of characterization analysis indicate that the as-prepared ultrathin narrow-band-gap g-C3N4 nanosheets show great light absorbance in visible light and high photogenerated charge separation capability. And the as-prepared ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets exhibit significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible light (lambda > 480 nm).									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000501006500018

In order to study the evolutionary dynamics of gpx gene family in allotetraploid fish species, we identified a total of 14 gpx genes in common carp Cyprinus carpio, while 9 gpx genes were discovered in the diploid progenitor-like species Poropuntius huangchuchieni. Comparative genomic analysis and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the common carp gpx genes had significant expansion and were divided into five distinct subclades. Exon-intron distribution patterns and conserved motif analysis revealed highly conserved evolutionary patterns. Transcript profiles suggested that different gpx genes had specific patterns of regulation during early embryonic development. In adult tissues, gpx genes had a relatively broad expression distribution, most of which were highly expressed in the gills, intestines, and gonads. RT-qPCR studies showed that most gpx genes were downregulated during the initial cd(2+) treatment stage. Dietary supplementation of Bacillus coagulans at different concentrations (Group 2 of 1.0 x 10(7) cfu/g, Group 3 of 1.0 x 10(8) cfu/g, and Group 4 of 1.0 x 10(9) cfu/g) induced different regulatory responses of gpx subclades. This result suggested that the appropriate concentration of B. coagulans can improve gpx gene expression when exposed to heavy metal cadmium treatment, which may play a vital role in the resistance to oxidative stress and immune responses. This study has expanded our understanding of the functional evolution of the gpx gene family in common carp.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0378-1119	1879-0038		WOS:000759512700003	35176426

Among various materials, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are considered promising candidates for catalysts and electrodes for electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems. Their diverse range of chemical properties make them highly versatile platforms for developing hybrid nanostructures, including flexible two-dimensional LDH nanostructures with various di-/tri-valent metals. Hybrid LDHs also exhibit unique structural attributes, including 3D hierarchical porous features and heterointerfaces, as well as optimized electrical conductivity and stability, which are crucial to achieving highly efficient multifunctional nanomaterials for electrochemical energy device applications. This review presents recent developments in the design, synthetic routes, structural/chemical modification strategies, and applications of hybrid LDHs as multifunctional nanomaterials for overall water splitting and electrochemical supercapacitors. Recent advances in modification strategies are critically assessed to determine their effect on the physicochemical properties of hybrid LDHs. The hybrid nanostructures' alteration of energy barriers in the electrocatalytic reactions is also discussed. Finally, this review concludes with future outlooks for hybrid LDH nanostructures.									40	2	0	0	1	0	40			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000624755900005

The resulting anodized nanoporous tin oxide (ANPTO) film has columnar-type pore channels with around 50 nm in diameter and is optically transparent. Electrochemical measurements with Fe(CN)(6)(3-) as a redox probe clearly revealed that the ANPTO film could be used for a working electrode with a large internal surface area. Moreover, it was found that ANPTO film had a wider anodic potential window (> ca. 2.0 V) than conventional metal oxide electrodes, such as FTO and indium tin oxide film electrodes (> ca. 1.3 V). The wide anodic potential window improves applicability of a transparent metal oxide electrode for various electrochemical oxidation reactions, which are often interfered by oxygen evolution in water. These results conclude that the ANPTO film can be used as an advanced transparent nanoporous film electrode. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Most of these studies have focused on a particular action of sulfide-its disruption of aerobic metabolism by the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration-and on the adaptations of sulfide-tolerant animals to avoid this toxic effect (1). We propose that sulfidic environments impose another hitherto overlooked type of toxicity: exposure to free radicals of oxygen, which may be produced during the spontaneous oxidation of sulfide, thus imposing an oxidative stress. Here we present evidence that oxygen- and sulfur-centered free radicals are produced during the oxidation of sulfide in seawater, and we propose a reaction pathway for sulfide oxidation that is consistent with our observations. We also show that chemiluminescence at visible wavelengths occurs during sulfide oxidation, providing a possible mechanism for the unexplained light emission from hydrothermal vents (2, 3).									75	0	0	0	61	0	78			0006-3185			WOS:000078835400006	25575385

A covalent organic framework (COF) has a precise and controllable structure, high pi-pi conjugation, large surface area, and porosity and shows great potential as an OER electrocatalyst. However, the relative conductivity and inherent instability greatly limit the further improvement of its performance. Herein, imine-based COF-supported Co/CoO nanoparticles (Co/CoO@COF) were developed for the high-performance electrocatalytic OER. For the Co/CoO@COF catalyst, Co/CoO could form a conjugation effect with the COF, which can increase the electron cloud density of the delocalized large pi bond, then improve the conductivity. The combination of Co/CoO and COF effectively enhances the structural stability of the catalyst and enriches the catalytic active sites. Under alkaline conditions, the Co/CoO@COF shows a very low overpotential of 278 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and a Tafel slope of 80.11 mV dec(-1) which is better than that of commercial RuO2.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000691697500001	34533186

Here, we demonstrate a novel approach to directly use waste eggshells as a reactor system for controlled synthesis of nanostructures formed on different substrates. This approach can recycle and transform the "trash" of waste eggshells into "treasure" of unique reactor systems for nanofabrication. The eggshell reactor system can provide unique conditions for the formation of nanostructures on various substrates. Using Co(OH)(2) as a model, amorphous Co(OH)(2) nanorod arrays, which cannot be synthesized conventionally by direct mixing of precursors, have been successfully formed on various substrates, including Ni foam, metal foil, and glass. To illustrate their potential applications, we use the as-fabricated amorphous Co(OH)(2) nanorod arrays on Ni foam as (1) binder-free electrodes for rechargeable alkaline batteries, demonstrating impressively good electrochemical performances, and (2) electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction, demonstrating improved electrocatalytic performances as compared to their crystalline counterpart. We believe the idea outlined here, using eggshell reactor system, can be further expanded to synthesize many different functional materials and precursors which can find additional applications, including self-cleaning, catalysis, sensor, electrochromic devices, etc.									24	1	0	0	0	0	24			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000394481800023	28165716

Hydrothermal and solvothermal approaches are considered to be less effective toward achieving high concentration of aliovalent donor dopants in a host oxide when compared to other synthesis methods that use long chain hydrocarbon solvents, fatty acids, and fatty amines as precursors. Because of this, although they have several advantages such as sustainability, ease of use, relatively inexpensive reagents and apparatus, and reduced environmental impact, they are excluded from the list of potential synthesis methods. Herein, an effective Zn2+ substitution with aliovalent Ga3+ in the ZnO host lattice is demonstrated, and it is achieved by increasing the reductive power of the solvothermal synthesis conditions by either solvent substitution or the addition of reducing agents. This increase results in an increased oxidation affinity of the medium. This in turn promotes Ga3+ incorporation into the ZnO lattice, by skewing the reaction equilibrium toward oxygen evolution.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1862-6300	1862-6319		WOS:000488073000001

Simultaneously, anisotropic properties will be exhibited by the materials with low crystal symmetry, allowing the tuning of the PEC properties by controlling the crystallographic orientation and exposed facets. Therefore, we synthesized copper tungstate films (CuWO4) with highly exposed (100) crystal facets by regulating anions in the precursor solution. According to experimental characterization and density functional theory calculations, the CuWO4 film with a high exposure ratio of the (100) crystal facet has promoted charge transport with trap free mode and reduced recombination of electrons and holes. Meanwhile, the oxygen evolution reaction is promoted on the (100) facet because of the relatively low energy barrier. Compared to the CuWO4 with other mixed exposure facets, CuWO4 with a highly exposed (100) facet presents a twofold current density (0.38 mA/cm2) and one-fifteenth electron transit time (0.698 ms) and also has great stability (more than 6 h). These results provide an easy way to enhance the PEC performance by modulating the exposure facets of the film electrode.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000875530400001	36228181

Present results indicate that turtle Hb displays a very low O2 affinity and a very small sensitivity to allosteric effectors and temperature. Furthermore, the amplitude of the Bohr effect for O2 binding is strongly reduced. In parallel, EPR and absorbance spectroscopic properties of the nitrosylated derivative of turtle Hb suggest that the hemoprotein is in a low-affinity conformation, even in the absence of allosteric effectors. These findings suggest the existence of unusual molecular mechanisms modulating the basic reaction of Hb with O2, Which may be linked to specific physiological needs related to the diving behavior of the turtle.									23	0	0	0	22	0	23			0006-3002			WOS:A1992JT18000003	1327156

In vivo quantification of photosystem II (PSII) function by direct chlorophyll fluorescence revealed that dark chilling (8 degrees) inhibited PSII function in the extreme chill sensitive genotype, Java 29 (JAs) mainly by deactivating reaction centers and inhibiting the conversion of excitation energy to electron transport and electron transfer from reduced plastoquinone to the PSI end electron acceptors. Further analysis of the normalized fast fluorescence transients, revealed that in JAs, upon dark chilling, disengagement of the oxygen evolution complex (Delta V-K band) occurred which coincided with a concomitant decrease in O-2 evolution measured in vitro. The chilling resistant Maple Arrow (MAr), though one night cold stress lead to a decrease in fluorescence emission at 2 ms (-Delta V-J band) indicating a decrease in the Q(A)(-) concentration due to cold-induced slow-down of electron donation from P-680, however showed clear signs of recovery after the second and third cold nights. The moderate chill sensitive genotype, Fiskeby V (FBm) responded in a fashion intermediate to above-mentioned extremes. A second experiment showed that in JAs the inhibitory effect increased with increasing time of exposure to light following dark chilling. Our data demonstrated that significant differences exist in the cold tolerance of different soybean genotypes: (a) In respect to activity criteria, expressed by the quantum yields for primary photochemistry phi(po) = TRo/ABS, for electron transport from photosystem II to photosystem I as phi(Eo) = ETo/ABS and the efficiency, (phi(Ro) = REo/ABS, to reduce the end electron acceptors of photosystem I up to NADP; (b) In respect to stability criteria, dependent on structure and conformation, such as the capability of energetic cooperativity (grouping) among photosynthetic units quantified by the grouping probability for exciton movements within the energetically connected group of entire photosynthetic units. Therefore analyzing the O-J-I-P fluorescence transient according to the JIP-test offers a practical and sensitive in vivo screening test for dark chilling tolerance in soybean. (C) 2014 SAAB.

Through image processing and analysis, we quantitatively characterize the RTCVD process. Larger and more compact graphene grains are found on CuO substrate. Furthermore, contrary to the hot wall CVD which exhibit instantaneous nucleation characteristics, our system exhibit substrate dependent non-constant nucleation rates. The coverage evolution can be well described by Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) model, with the exponent varies from 3.9 to 2.1 for Cu and CuO substrate, respectively. Putting the measured fractal dimensions into the JMAK model, we find exponents related to non-equilibrium nucleation rates that qualitatively agree with observations. Our analysis suggests that new nucleation centers are more efficiently suppressed on CuO substrate during the RTCVD process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite these merits, hematites modest oxygen evolution reaction kinetics and its poor efficiency in delivering photogenerated holes, especially holes generated by green photons, to the electrode/solution interface, render it ineffective as a practical water-splitting catalyst. Here we show that hole delivery and catalytic utilization can be substantially improved through Ti alloying, provided that the alloyed material is present in ultrathin-thin-film form. Notably, the effects are most pronounced for charges photogenerated by photons with energy comparable to the band gap for excitation of Fe(3d) -> Fe(3d) transitions (i.e., green photons). Additionally, at the optimum Ti substitution level the lifetimes of surface-localized holes, competent for water oxidation, are extended. Together these changes explain an overall improvement in photoelectrochemical performance, especially enhanced internal quantum efficiencies, observed upon Ti(IV) incorporation.									56	0	0	0	3	0	57			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000347138000032	25414974

This review briefly introduces the basic principles and influencing factors of [(001)-(101)-TiO2]. On this basis, the effect of heterostructures formed by different materials and modification methods on its photocatalytic activity are elaborated in detail. Mainly formed heterostructures mentioned in this review include oxygen vacancy/Ti3+-[(001)-(101)-TiO2] heterostructures, noble metal-[(001)-(101)-TiO2] heterostructures, metal sulfide-[(001)-(101)-TiO2] heterostructures, metal oxide-[(001)-(101)-TiO2] heterostructures and carbon material-[(001)-(101)-TiO2] heterostructures. The light absorption range and charge separation mechanism of (001)-(101)-TiO2 after modification are discussed. Moreover, the application of photocatalytic redox reaction in simulating photosynthesis to prepare new energy (hydrogen evolution and CO2 reduction), environmental purification and sterilization is introduced in detail. Finally, various measures of designing (001)-(101)-TiO2 nanostructures for further applications in energy production and environmental remediation are discussed.									6	1	0	0	1	0	7			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000589659200001	33150712

Modification of the electrochemical behaviour and semiconductive properties of passive film formed on steel surface in the presence of tartrate were characterised by a range of electrochemical techniques in saturated calcium hydroxide. In the presence of tartrate in saturated calcium hydroxide with addition of 0.14M sodium chloride pitting corrosion initiation was postponed for 622mV up to potentials of oxygen evolution reaction. The hypothesis on the competitive adsorption between the chloride ions and tartrate anion through the surface complex formation was applied on the studied system.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0947-5117	1521-4176		WOS:000363469400019

The properties of the VO2 films were investigated for thermo-optical switching applications. Synthesized VO2 film displays a phase transition at 65 - 68 degreesC. It exhibits an abrupt change in optical reflectivity over the phase transition temperature range. Results for VO2 on a highly reflective metal layer are strongly dependent on the VO2 thickness. The optical switching has a major hysteresis of about 15 degreesC between the heating and cooling branches. The evolution of the surface morphology with the oxidation time was studied with a SEM. The VO2 film was patterned on microplatforms by metal lift-off technique. We conclude that the evaporation followed by oxidation is an effective method to produce active VO2 film for thermo-optical switching devices.

The role of synthesis temperature on the structural, morphological, and optical properties of the prepared zinc oxide samples was deeply investigated. The obtained photoluminescence and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy outcomes will be used to discuss the surface structure defects of the prepared samples. The results indicated that the prepared samples are polycrystalline in nature, and the sample prepared at 700 degrees C revealed a tremendously c-axis oriented zinc oxide. The temperature -driven morphological evolution of the zinc oxide nano-coalesced microstructures was perceived, resulting in transformation of quasi -mountain chain-like to pyramidal textured zinc oxide with increasing the synthesis temperature. The results also impart that the sample prepared at 500 degrees C shows a higher percentage of the zinc interstitial and oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, the intensity of the photoluminescence emission in the ultraviolet region was enhanced as the heating temperature increased from 500 C to 700 degrees C. Lastly, the growth mechanism of the zinc oxide nano -coalesced microstructures is discussed according to the reaction conditions.									35	0	0	0	1	0	35			1996-1944			WOS:000375158900086	28773425

The hydrogen uptake rate of these Pd-MgOx-Mg samples shows a peculiar dependence on the thickness of the MgOx layer. For thin oxide layers (small added amounts of oxygen) the hydrogen rate uptake increases, compared with pure Pd-Mg samples. Thicker oxide films (larger amounts of added oxygen) cause a monotonic decline of the hydrogen uptake rate. However, even very large oxygen exposures/uptakes cannot prevent hydrogen uptake completely. MgOx is thus only a partial but not a perfect diffusion barrier for hydrogen. Repeated hydriding-dehydriding cycles increase the hydrogen uptake rate by Pd-MgOx-Mg samples, compared with the rate during the first cycle. The results are discussed in terms of a combined effect of the MgO, layer, affecting both hydrogen transport and nucleation of the hydride phase.									83	2	1	0	0	0	88			0925-8388			WOS:A1996UK44000011

The physicochemical properties of the catalyst were characterized via X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The electrochemical properties of the catalyst were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS), chronopotentiometry and Tafel curve measurements in 0.1 mol L-1 H2SO4 at room temperature. The test results showed that the catalytic properties of IrO2/SnO2 depended on the mass ratio of iridium to tin, and that the optimal mass ratio was 2:1. The optimized catalyst was applied to a membrane electrode assembly (MEA), and the stationary current-potential relationships were determined. With an IrO2/SnO2 (2:1) anode, a 40% Pt/C cathode and a total noble metal (Ir, Pt) loading of 1.2 mg cm(-2), the terminal applied potential difference of the water electrolysis was 1.70 V at 2 A cm(-2) and 80 degrees C.

Photothermal beam deflection (PBD) spectroscopy determines enthalpy changes (Delta H) and apparent volume changes which are coupled with electron transfer in the S-state cycle (Krivanek R, Dau H, Haumann M (2008) Biophys J 94: 1890-1903). Recent PBD results on formation of the Q (A) (-) /Y (Z) (aEuro cent+) radical pair suggest a value of Delta H similar to the free energy change, Delta G, of -540 +/- A 40 meV previously determined by the analysis of recombination fluorescence, but presently the uncertainty range of Delta H values determined by PBD is still high (+/- 250 meV). In the oxygen-evolving transition, S-3 -> S-0, the enthalpy change may be close to zero. A prominent non-thermal signal is associated with both Q (A) (-) /Y (Z) (aEuro cent+) formation (< 1 mu s) and the S-3 -> S-0 transition (similar to 1 ms). The observed (apparent) volume expansion (Delta V of about +40 (3) per PSII unit) in the S-3 -> S-0 transition seems to revert, at least partially, the contractions on lower S-transitions and may also comprise contributions from O-2 and proton release. The observed volume changes show that the S-3 -> S-0 transition is accompanied by significant nuclear movements, which likely are of importance with respect to energetics and mechanism of photosynthetic water oxidation. Detailed PBD studies on all S-transitions will contribute to the progress in PSII research by providing insights not accessible by other spectroscopic methods.									9	1	0	0	4	0	10			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000271795400034	19330462

The synthetic approach includes fast generation of hydrogen bubbles as well as fast deposition of Co-P, which played a key role in forming a porous Co-P foam structure. The Co-P foam exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity and stability in both acidic and alkaline solution. Its HER activity was recorded with an over potential of 50 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 131 mV in 1 M KOH at 10 mA cm(-2), which is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C (eta@10 mA cm(0.5 M H2SO4)(-2): 33 mV, (eta 10) (mA), (1M) (KOH): 80 mV). The Co-P foam (eta@10 mA cm(-2): 300 mV) exhibits better OER activities than Ir/C (n@10 mA cm(-2): 345 mV) and RuO2 (eta@10 mA cm(-2): 359 mV) in 1 M KOH solution. The excellent performance of the Co-P foam as an HER and OER catalyst can be attributed to the charge separation between Co and P in Co-P foam as well as the porous foam structure providing a large electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). The ECSA of the Co-P foam was calculated to be 118 cm(2), which was 2.4 times higher than that of a Co-P film (49 cm(2)).									107	7	0	0	6	0	106			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000390083200008

The following main conclusions can be identified with respect to irradiated TRISO fuel: first, the relatively low oxygen potential within the fuel particles with respect to PWR fuel leads to chemical speciation that is not typical of PWR fuels, e.g., the relatively volatile behaviour of barium; secondly, the safety-critical fission-product caesium is released from the urania kernel but the buffer and pyrolytic-carbon coatings could form an important chemical barrier to further migration (i.e., formation of carbides). Finally, significant releases of fission gases from the urania kernel are expected even in nominal conditions. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Among them, polymeric carbon nitride (CN) has drawn much attention as a promising metal-free photocatalyst. As it is known, a number of promising co-catalysts have been developed to improve catalytic reactions, Pt nanoparticles is still among the best co-catalysts for CN in photocatalytic H-2 evolution, due to the suitable Fermi level to transfer excited electrons and the low overpotential for H-2 reduction. Herein, we report the interface engineering of urea derived bulk CN and Pt co-catalyst by using a small portion of N-doped carbon (N-C) as a transition layer with a boosted photocatalytic activity up to 7 times. It was revealed that the activation energy of the Pt co-catalyst for water reduction was lowered in the presence of N-C, and the intimate interaction between CN and N-C, ascribing to the similar elemental composition and crystal structure, promoted the efficient separation and migration of charge carriers. This study may open a new avenue to develop CN-based photocatalysts for solar fuel conversion with even higher activity by photocatalyst/co-catalyst interface engineering.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0743-7463			WOS:000487859300008	31464446

The hierarchical structure can provide lots of pathways for fast ion diffusion and charge transfer, and expose abundant catalytic sites. Meanwhile, the activity of FeNi-O-rGA is boosted by the optimized metaloxygen bond strength in FeNi3 alloys. Partial oxidized FeNi nanorods are strongly coupled with rGA by the formation of metal-O-C bonds, which can impede the aggregation of FeNi3 alloys and increase the utilization of active sites. The special structure and partially oxidized FeNi nanorods for FeNi-O-rGA can result in excellent OER activity and catalytic stability. Only 215 mV of overpotential is required to drive the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) as well as the Tafel slope of 50.9 mV/dec in 1 mol/L KOH. The change of surface chemistry of FeNi-O-rGA is confirmed by XPS after the OER test, which indicates the highly catalytic stability of FeNi-O-rGA due to the formation of intermediate metal oxyhydroxide.

To actualize the large-scale hydrogen production, it is paramount to develop low-cost, earth-abundant, efficient, and stable electrocatalysts. Among those electrocatalysts, alternative architectural arrays grown on conductive substrates have been proven to be highly efficient toward water splitting due to large surface area, abundant active sites, and synergistic effects between the electrocatalysts and the substrates. Herein, the advancement of nanoarray architectures in electrocatalytic applications is reviewed. The categories of different nanoarrays and the reliable and versatile synthetic approaches of electrocatalysts are summarized. A unique emphasis is highlighted on the promising strategies to enhance the electrocatalytic activities and stability of architectural arrays by component manipulation, heterostructure regulation, and vacancy engineering. The intrinsic mechanism analysis of electronic structure optimization, intermediates' adsorption facilitation, and coordination environments' amelioration is also discussed with regard to theoretical simulation and in situ identification. Finally, the challenges and opportunities on the valuable directions and promising pathways of architectural arrays toward outstanding electrocatalytic performance are provided in the energy conversion field, facilitating the development of promising water splitting systems.									235	15	0	0	12	0	237			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000471335500006

Herein, we show that a novel nanohybrid with CoS nanosheets vertically grown on carbon cloth (CoS/CC) can be used as an efficient self supported hydrogen-evolving cathode for water splitting over a wide pH range. This material affords a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at a small overpotential of 192 mV and 212 mV in basic and acidic media, respectively, along with a long-term stability for over 50 h. The unique 3D structure constructed by the vertically arranged nanosheets and the intimate contact between the CoS nanosheets and the underlying conductive carbon are believed to be responsible for the excellent catalytic performance.

The electrochemical properties were investigated by polarization, impedance spectroscopy and chrono-potentiometric measurements. A decrease of the ohmic contact resistance between the bipolar plates and the electrode backing layer was obtained by using an appropriate thickness for the gas diffusion layers/current collectors as well as by an optimization of stack compression. The amount of H-2 produced was similar to 90 1 H-1 at 60 A (600 mA cm(-2)) and 75 degrees C under 300 W of applied electrical power. No significant leakage or gas recombination was observed. The stack electrical efficiency was 75% and 88%, at 60 A and 75 degrees C, with respect to the low and high heating value of hydrogen, respectively.

LSM-YSZ composite layer was placed on the interface between electrode/electrolyte as a reaction active layer, subsequently LSM as an intermediate layer and LSCF as a current collector were deposited by screen printing. The type of the LSM-YSZ composite powders used in the cell fabrication influenced the microstructure of the catalytic bottom layer. Furthermore, the addition of the polymeric resin to the particulate paste permits us to produce a nanoporous electrode of high porosity and surface area after thermal decomposition and crystallization. The electrochemical cell of such a microstructural feature showed a significantly improved electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen reduction.

Recently, the atomically dispersed metal catalysts have attracted increasing attention due to their ultimate atom utilization and great potential for highly cost-effective and high-efficiency HER electrocatalyst. Herein, we propose a high-temperature treatment strategy to furtherly improve the HER performance of atomically dispersed Pt-based catalyst. Interestingly, after appropriate high-temperature treatment on the atomically dispersed Pt-0.8@CN, the Pt species on the designed N-doped porous carbon substrate with rich defect sites can be re-dispersed to single atom state with new coordination environment. The obtained Pt-0.8@CN-1000 shows superior HER performance with overpotential of 13 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and mass activity of 11,284 mA/mgPt at -0.1 V, much higher than that of the pristine Pt-0.8@CN and commercial Pt/C catalyst. The experimental and theoretical investigations indicate that the high-temperature treatment induces the restructuring of coordination environment and then the optimized Pt electronic state leads to the enhanced HER performances. This work affords new strategy and insights to develop the atomically dispersed high-efficiency catalysts.

Cocatalyst loading is essential for activation of such oxynitride photocatalysts. However, cocatalyst nanoparticles form aggregates and exhibit weak interaction with photocatalysts, which prevents eliciting their intrinsic photocatalytic performance. Here, we demonstrate efficient utilization of photoexcited electrons in a single-crystalline particulate BaTaO2N photocatalyst prepared with the assistance of RbCl flux for H-2 evolution reactions via sequential decoration of Pt cocatalyst by impregnation-reduction followed by site-selective photodeposition. The Pt-loaded BaTaO2N photocatalyst evolves H-2 over 100 times more efficiently than before, with an apparent quantum yield of 6.8% at the wavelength of 420nm, from a methanol aqueous solution, and a solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency of 0.24% in Z-scheme water splitting. Enabling uniform dispersion and intimate contact of cocatalyst nanoparticles on single-crystalline narrow-bandgap particulate photocatalysts is a key to efficient solar-to-chemical energy conversion. Activation of narrow-bandgap photocatalysts holds key to applicable solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion. Here, the authors demonstrate effective sequential cocatalyst decoration for such narrow-bandgap photocatalysts to realise highly-efficient hydrogen evolution and Z-scheme water splitting.									59	4	0	0	4	0	57			2041-1723			WOS:000620682300010	33579929

Doping engineering is widely utilized to tailor the electrical property, while investigation on the dopant-induced modification of active sites remains elusive. To address this issue, we construct an ideal model of atomically-thin layers and hence deliberately create element doping on their surface. As an example, freestanding N-doped MoO3 single-layers are first synthesized by virtue of a lamellar intermediate. Positron annihilation spectrometry discloses that N-doping leads to increased (V0V0 center dot center dot)-V-center dot divacancies relative to intact MoO3 single-layers, while the similar electrochemical active area implies that the increased (V0V0 center dot center dot)-V-center dot divacancies accounts for the former's 6 times higher H-2 evolution activity. In addition, density-functional calculations revealed that the presence of (V0V0 center dot)-V-center dot center dot divacancies results in increased states density near the valence band edge, which favors their improved electronic conductivity, verified by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. This work demonstrates that N-doping confined in MoO3 atomic-layers increase the concentration of (V0V0 center dot center dot)-V-center dot center dot divacancies, which are first verified to be highly active sites for H-2 evolution. Thus, doping engineering in atomic-layers opens new opportunities for achieving efficient catalytic performances through tailoring the catalytically active sites. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The strong oxidation ability of BDD electrode is mainly attributed to the hydroxyl radicals, which can degrade organics efficiently, and occupy an important position in the BDD electro catalytic system. In this paper, BDD electrode was prepared by hot flame chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) and characterized by XRD, SEM and Raman, using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultraviolet spectrophotometer (UV) two different methods for detecting the center dot OH concentration in BDD electrode. Results show that: the concentration of hydroxyl radical in the BDD electrode can be measured by two kinds of methods, and the results are basically consistent.

It was shown that the initial step in both processes involves a rapid reactant adsorption on the metal surface. The adsorbate consists of molecular ethyne, partially dehydrogenated hydrocarbon residues C2Hx and C-2-oxygen-containing species in a ratio dependent on the electrode potential. The maximum electrode coverage is achieved in the potential range 0.2-0.4 V, whereas the major part of the adsorbate is ethyne itself. Ethane was identified as the main volatile product of the cathodic hydrogenation of the surface species. A trace amount of 1-butene was formed in a slow side reaction. Evolution of a mixture of ethane and ethene was observed in the presence of bulk reactant. Measurements at various sweep rates revealed that electrooxidation of the preadsorbed ethyne to CO2 at E > 0.8 V is much faster than its electroreduction in the hydrogen potential region. The optimal conditions for monitoring and/or utilization of ethyne in an electrochemical cell working in a programmed step potential mode are specified. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

These hazardous phenomena not only lead to the loss of calorific values of coals but also pose serious fire issues in the coal mining, handling and utilisation industries. Coals usually demonstrate diverse characteristics in the phenomena of self-heating and spontaneous combustion, because of their differences in chemical constituents, physical structure, sizes and weathering conditions. For this reason, the understanding and ranking of the tendency of coals towards self-heating and spontaneous combustion have practical importance in providing guidance for safe mining and fire prevention during their transport and storage. So far various approaches have been made to evaluate the liability of coals to self-heating and spontaneous ignition, which are based on the studies of the effects of coal and oxygen interaction, such as oxygen uptake by a coal, generation of oxidation products as well as evolution of heat. This paper provides a summary on the relevant techniques for determining the potential of coals towards self-heating and spontaneous ignition. Three conventional techniques, i. e. 'oxygen adsorption', crossing-point temperature (CPT) and adia-batic calorimeters, are introduced, and the methods developed in recent decades are also discussed, with the focus on the technique based on DTA/DSC, basket heating and Chen's method. The information provided for individual techniques includes their development history, indices established for testing, operation procedures for measuring the values of indices and the principles for ranking the propensity of coals towards self-heating and auto-ignition. Analysis of the features of these test methods indicates that the methods introduced in recent decades have been more concentrated on the evaluation of the capacity of coals to generate oxidation products and the apparent (intrinsic) kinetic data of chemical reactions occurred during the coal-oxygen interactions, compared to three conventional ones. It is also concluded that, the existing test methods examine the self-heating and auto-ignition behaviour of coals from different observation angles; therefore, the indices determined by individual methods only reveal the true potential of self-heating and auto-ignition of coals to a certain extent.			煤自加热和自燃现象是煤暴露在空气中经历氧化反应表现出的特性,是煤开采、运输和存储过程中导致火灾事故的上要原因.对研究煤与氧气相瓦作用效果的方法和随之产生的煤自燃倾向性测定方法进行了概述,包括发展历史、测定参数和操作要点.不仅介绍了3种传统技术,即"氧吸附"法、交叉点温度法(CPT)和绝热量热计法,还以基丁DTA/DSC的测试方法,篮热法和陈氏方法为重点,探讨了近几十年开发和应用的主要技术和方法.通过对不同测试方法功能的比较和分析,阐明了它们各自的优缺点.						1	7	0	0	0	0	8			1009-6094			CSCD:3574497

Complex 1 displayed an overpotential (eta) of 1.07V at 1 mAcm(-2) and an observed rate constant (k(obs)) of 13.5 s(-1) at eta 1.0 V in pH 9.0 phosphate buffer solution, whereas 2 exhibited a significantly smaller eta (0.70 V) to reach 1 mAcm(-2) and a higher k(obs) (50.4 s(-1)) than 1 under identical test conditions. Additionally, 2 displayed better stability than 1 in controlled potential electrolysis experiments with a faradaic efficiency of 94% for O-2 evolution at 1.58 V, when a casing tube was used for the Pt cathode. A possible mechanism for 1- and 2-catalyzed O-2 evolution reactions is discussed based on the experimental evidence. These comparative results indicate that fine-tuning the structures of tetradentate N-4 ligands can bring about significant change in the performance of copper complexes for electrochemical water oxidation.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000416158500035	28868648

However, the investigation of EMSIs at nanoscale under different environments has not been well studied. In this work, gas-phase synthesized Pt NP and thermally grown CuO nanowire (NW) EMSI evolution is characterized via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Peak-Force Kelvin probe force microscopy, in order to describe the chemical state and surface potential of the nanocatalysts. Changes in the system's EMSIs after NP deposition and thermal annealing have important effects for different nanomaterials' applications. A significant amount of charge transfer was observed on the CuO NWs after deposition of Pt NPs, which greatly enhanced the catalytic performance of this material for methanol oxidation. Heating the Pt NP-CuO NW system elevated the Pt oxidation states and slowed the charge transfer such that the system exhibited different CO gas sensing mechanisms at two different temperatures, one related to the EMSI at 200 degrees C and the other related to oxygen spillover at 250 degrees C. This description of the CuO-NW-supported Pt NP electronic interactions under different reaction environments highlights the importance of EMSI tailoring for supported Pt nanocatalysts.									8	1	0	0	0	0	9			2574-0970			WOS:000566778600101

Two methods were used to immobilize these Co corroles on carbon nanotubes (CNTs): Co 5,15-bis(pentafluorophenyl)-10-(4)-(1-azido)phenylcorrole (1) was grafted on CNTs via covalent bonds, whereas Co tris(pentafluorophenyl)corrole (2) was directly loaded through simple physical adsorption. When examined in alkaline media, covalently grafted Co corroles displayed much higher electrocatalytic ORR efficiency than simply adsorbed analogues. ORR half-wave potential at 0.85 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode was achieved by using grafted Co corroles with PPh3 axial ligand, which represents the state-of-the-art performance for molecular catalysis under alkaline conditions. Remarkably, 1 with PPh3 ligand outperforms 1 with py ligand in terms of anodically shifted half-wave potential by 130 mV, but 2 with either PPh3 or py axial ligand displays almost identical efficiency. These results show that (1) improved ORR performance can be achieved by using axial ligand of stronger electron-donating ability but (2) immobilization method may weaken catalyst design for molecular electrocatalysis. Therefore, caution should be paid when analyzing structural effects of molecular catalysts that are loaded on supporting materials.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000558662500010

Compared with the majority of carbon materials, it has electron-rich properties, basic surface functionalities and H-bonding motifs due to the presence of N and H atoms. It is thus regarded as a potential candidate to complement carbon in material applications. In this review, a brief introduction to g-C3N4 is given, the methods used for synthesizing this material with different textural structures and surface morphologies are described, and its physicochemical properties are referred. In addition, four aspects of the applications of g-C3N4 in catalysis are discussed: (1) as a base metal-free catalyst for NO decomposition, (2) as a reference material in differentiating oxygen activation sites for oxidation reactions over supported catalysts, (3) as a functional material to synthesize nanosized metal particles, and (4) as a metal-free catalyst for photocatalysis. The reasons for the use of g-C3N4 for such applications are also given, and we expect that this paper will inspire readers to search for further new applications for this material in catalysis and in other fields.									753	41	1	0	77	1	778			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000343018200001	25215903

Water electrolysis, powered by renewable energy sources, is regarded as the most environmentally friendly and efficient technology for hydrogen production. Generally, the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process at the anode predominantly limits the efficiency of water electrolysis. Therefore, developing highly efficient electrocatalysts to accelerate the OER kinetic process has always been a crucial and hot topic. Recently, transition metal oxide (TMO)-based materials have attracted much attention as OER electrocatalysts because of their facile fabrication, low cost, and synergistic effects between the coupled metals. However, further enhancement of the catalytic performance of TMO encounters a bottleneck originated from the limited regulation strategies.Typically, regulation strategies of metal oxide-based electrocatalysts could be classified into three different levels. (1) For the bulk TMO electrocatalyst, reducing the particle size would generate more catalytically active sites, which is usually adopted as the basic method to enhance the overall catalytic activities. However, simple reduction in the particle size demonstrated limited promotion of the catalytic performance, because the intrinsic activity of individual sites is still very low. (2) To further enhance the catalytic activity of TMO, mesoscale modulation strategies are proposed, which usually involve the optimization of interfaces where the active sites are embedded in, including surface reconstruction, constructing heterostructure, and phase engineering. (3) In addition to the interface modulation, more remarkable regulation strategies focus on enhancing the catalytic performance at the atomic level, such as heteroatom doping, defect engineering, and so on. In addition to the modulation of electrocatalysts themselves, recent advances demonstrated that external field effects can also manipulate the catalytic property of TMO-based electrocatalysts by coupling the field with the active sites. All these strategies would afford considerable opportunities on fundamental investigation and practical applications of TMO-based electrocatalysts.In this Account, we highlighted recent progress of the regulation strategies for TMO-based electrocatalysts. We started with the introduction of two different basic mechanisms of OER process. Then we conducted an in-depth discussion about the regulation strategies used to enhance the OER activities of TMO-based electrocatalysts, including defect engineering, surface reconstruction, phase engineering, interface engineering, and application of an external field. We end the Account with a summary of current challenges for TMO-based electrocatalysts for OER and point out some possible opportunities for the future designing of highly efficient TMO-based electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2643-6728		WOS:000862362700001		
J	Di Donato, A; Malgarini, G; Oeters, F; Zhang, LY								A model of post-combustion and heat transfer at smelting reduction with a foamy slag								STEEL RESEARCH				70	10			386	394		10.1002/srin.199905657				OCT 1999	1999	A smelting reduction reactor with post-combustion in a foamy slag has two slag layers. In the lower, iron oxide from the slag is reduced to iron by carbon. In the upper, the gas from the reduction is post-combusted to CO2+H2O. The post-combustion heat is transferred from the rising post-combustion gas to the upper slag, and, therefrom, by slag circulation to the lower slag layer where the endothermic reduction reaction takes place. Unavoidably, slag circulation also transfers part of the char into the upper slag where it is oxidised. A kinetic postcombustion and heat transfer model describes these phenomena. The main process parameters, namely real post-combustion degree, carbon oxidation, heat transfer efficiency, distribution of temperatures of gas and slag in the single regions of the reactor, coal consumption, and iron production rate are given as functions of the ratio of post-combustion oxygen to gas evolution rate of the system. The main influences on which heat efficiency and off-gas temperature as the most important output parameter depend are discussed. Controlled stirring and a regular gas through-put are of primary importance. The required values are given. A comparison with pilot plant results of the CSM process shows good agreement with the model results.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0177-4832			WOS:000085096800002

Since the existing literature does not have any models that investigate the impact of both angiogenesis and molecular signaling pathways on treatment, we propose a novel multi-scale, agent-based computational model that includes both angiogenesis and EGFR modules to study the response of brain cancer under tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) treatment.Results: The novel angiogenesis module integrated into the agent-based tumor model is based on a set of reaction-diffusion equations that describe the spatio-temporal evolution of the distributions of micro-environmental factors such as glucose, oxygen, TGF alpha, VEGF and fibronectin. These molecular species regulate tumor growth during angiogenesis. Each tumor cell is equipped with an EGFR signaling pathway linked to a cell-cycle pathway to determine its phenotype. EGFR TKIs are delivered through the blood vessels of tumor microvasculature and the response to treatment is studied.Conclusions: Our simulations demonstrated that entire tumor growth profile is a collective behaviour of cells regulated by the EGFR signaling pathway and the cell cycle. We also found that angiogenesis has a dual effect under TKI treatment: on one hand, through neo-vasculature TKIs are delivered to decrease tumor invasion; on the other hand, the neo-vasculature can transport glucose and oxygen to tumor cells to maintain their metabolism, which results in an increase of cell survival rate in the late simulation stages.									32	2	0	0	25	0	36			1471-2105			WOS:000310628000001	22935054

For instance, before the development of a persistently oxygenated deep ocean, the ocean interior likely alternated between states buffered by reduced sulfur ("euxinic") and buffered by reduced iron ("ferruginous"), with important implications for the cycles and hence bioavailability of dissolved iron (and phosphate). Even after atmospheric oxygen concentrations rose to modern-like values, the ocean episodically continued to develop regions of euxinic or ferruginous conditions, such as those associated with past key intervals of organic carbon deposition (e.g. during the Cretaceous) and extinction events (e.g. at the Permian-Triassic boundary). A better understanding of the cycling of iron and sulfur in an anoxic ocean, how geochemical patterns in the ocean relate to the available spatially heterogeneous geological observations, and quantification of the feedback strengths between nutrient cycling, biological productivity, and ocean redox requires a spatially resolved representation of ocean circulation together with an extended set of (bio)geochemical reactions.Here, we extend the "muffin" release of the intermediate-complexity Earth system model cGENIE to now include an anoxic iron and sulfur cycle (expanding the existing oxic iron and sulfur cycles), enabling the model to simulate ferruginous and euxinic redox states as well as the precipitation of reduced iron and sulfur minerals (pyrite, siderite, greenalite) and attendant iron and sulfur isotope signatures, which we describe in full. Because tests against present-day (oxic) ocean iron cycling exercises only a small part of the new code, we use an idealized ocean configuration to explore model sensitivity across a selection of key parameters. We also present the spatial patterns of concentrations and delta Fe-56 and delta S-34 isotope signatures of both dissolved and solid-phase Fe and S species in an anoxic ocean as an example application. Our sensitivity analyses show that the first-order results of the model are relatively robust against the choice of kinetic parameter values within the Fe-S system and that simulated concentrations and reaction rates are comparable to those observed in process analogues for ancient oceans (i.e. anoxic lakes). Future model developments will address sedimentary recycling and benthic iron fluxes back to the water column, together with the coupling of nutrient (in particular phosphate) cycling to the iron cycle.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1991-959X	1991-9603		WOS:000653629600002

By-products such as formaldehyde and formic acid are usually also formed during electrolyses, with the latter formed at a similar rate as that of methanol. In this study, V2O5 was added to the composition of the GDE to improve its selectivity for methanol. TiO2/RuO2/V2O5 powder hot-pressed with PTFE resulted in a GDE suitable for oxidative electrosynthesis with simultaneous oxygen evolution. By feeding the TiO2/RuO2/V2O5/PTFE GDE with methane, it was possible to enhance its selectivity for methanol at low values of current density. Furthermore, the formation of formic acid and formaldehyde was suppressed, allowing for higher current efficiencies. The addition of 5.6% of V2O5 increased the electrode's current efficiency to 57% at 2.0 V, which is 2-fold higher than the efficiency achieved in the absence of vanadium oxide. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Symbiotic corals play a central role in the creation of biologically rich ecosystems based on mutualistic symbioses between the invertebrate coral and dinoflagellate protists from the genus Symbiodinium. In this study, we experimentally establish that Symbiodinium photosynthesis, both as a free-living unicellular algae and as part of the symbiotic association with the coral Stylophora pistillata, is 'wired' to the circadian clock mechanism with a 'free-run' cycle close to 24 h. Associated photosynthetic pigments also showed rhythmicity under light/dark conditions and under constant light conditions, while the expression of the oxygen-evolving enhancer 1 gene (within photosystem II) coincided with photosynthetically evolved oxygen in Symbiodinium cultures. Thus, circadian regulation of the Symbiodinium photosynthesis is, however, complicated as being linked to the coral/host that have probably profound physiochemical influence on the intracellular environment. The temporal patterns of photosynthesis demonstrated here highlight the physiological complexity and interdependence of the algae circadian clock associated in this symbiosis and the plasticity of algae regulatory mechanisms downstream of the circadian clock.									31	0	0	0	30	0	32			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000317482100003	23554392

Metal phosphides (MPs) have been explored as cheap advanced materials in various catalytic fields. MP materials are usually synthesized through gas-solid phosphorization reaction in a trial-to-error manner, but their formation mechanism and the origin of controlled synthesis remain unclear. Here, we combine in situ thermogravimetric analysis-mass spectrometry (TG-MS) and quasi-in situ X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis to probe the transformation mechanism from metal oxides (MOs) to MPs during the phosphorization process mediated by hypophosphite. Temperature, time, and the amount of hypophosphite are revealed as the driven forces while oxophilicity and crystallinity as the impeded forces, simultaneously control the component and defect level of a series of MP (M = Ni, Co, W, Mo, and Nb). The asobtained WO2.9/WP is proved to be an efficient Z-scheme photocatalyst for oxidative coupling of methane with the total C-2(+) production and C2H4 selectivity in C2+ products reaching 10.75 mu mol.g(-1) and 98.25%. Our work provides a fundamental understanding of the phosphorization treatment and thereby guides a viable synthetic route to the controlled synthesis of MOx-delta, MP, MOx-delta/MP, and MP/M heterostructured materials.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000805903200005

Notwithstanding, the process suffered from long hydraulic retention time, and the activation regime remained unclear. Herein, using Pd/Al2O3 catalyst as particle electrode for initiating PDS oxidation in the cathodic cell can degrade various organic pollutants with varying the kinetic constants from 0.0256 min(-1) to 0.0645 min(-1), which were at least 5-fold higher than that in previous studies. The reactive oxygen species were determined to be SO4 center dot-/center dot OH. These radicals were readily formed from the single-electron reduction of PDS by electro-induced atomic hydrogen (indirect reduction mechanism), while direct two-electron transfer from electro-generated H-2 to PDS consumed its oxidation capacity without yielding radical due to the higher energy barrier. Revealing the mechanism of electrochemically unleashing the oxidative power of PDS into SO4 center dot- can rationalize the design of scalable electrode for PDS-based water purification.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000724532100007

ALD chemistries between dimethylberyllium and two different oxygen sources, H2O and O-3, are governed by different reaction mechanisms, resulting in different film properties. At growth temperatures ranging from 150 to 300 degrees C, the properties of the BeO films grown using H2O are temperature-independent. In contrast, the BeO films grown using O-3 at low temperatures (<200 degrees C) show high concentrations of carbon and hydrogen, possibly owing to the incomplete removal of the ligands of the precursor, leading to a low film density. This correlates with the evolution of the rough surface and the microstructure composed of few nanometer-sized grains. The low-quality BeO films grown using O-3 at low temperatures (<200 degrees C) show a decreased band gap (E-g: 7.77.9 eV) and dielectric constant (epsilon(r): 5.66.7). Above 250 degrees C, these properties recovered to the levels (E-g similar to 9.4 eV and epsilon(r) similar to 8.1) of the BeO films grown using H2O, which show high values of E-g similar to 9.19.4 eV and epsilon(r) similar to 8. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the O-3-ALD process requires relatively more thermal energy than H2O-ALD does, to produce high-quality BeO films.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1932-7447			WOS:000408179500054

In this work, for the first time, CdS quantum dots and carbon nanodots (CDs) were successfully co-immobilized in the cages of MIL-101 by one-step double solvents method followed by heating treatment. The optimum photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate of CD/CdS@MIL-101(50) composite with CDs content of 5.2 wt% exhibits a H-2 evolution rate of 14.66 mu mol h(-1) without noble metal assisted under visible-light irradiation, which is 8.5 and 18.6 times higher than that of CdS@MIL-101 and bare CdS, respectively. The improved photocatalytic H-2-production activity of CD/CdS@MIL-101 ternary composite is predominantly attributed to the effect of CDs, which mainly serves as an electron collector to efficiently prolong the lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers from CdS@MIL-101 heterostructure. This work provide a new strategy of one-step double solvents method to co-incorporate two functional species to the pores of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to improve the photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity of host photocatalyst.									121	8	0	0	14	0	121			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000457952600035

Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s, CYP) are widespread in nature and are involved in the biosynthesis of many natural products. P450s are heme-containing enzymes that use molecular oxygen and the hydride donor NAD(P)H (coupled via enzymic redox partners) to catalyze the insertion of oxygen into C-H bonds in a regio- and stereo-selective manner, effecting hydroxylation and several other reactions. With the rapid development of systems biology, numerous novel P450s have been identified for the biosynthesis of natural products, but there are still several challenges to the efficient heterologous expression of active P450s. This review covers recent developments in P450 research and development, including the properties and functions of P450s, discovery and mining of novel P450s, modification and screening of P450 mutants, improved heterologous expression of P450s in microbial hosts, efficient whole-cell transformation with P450s, and current applications of P450s for the biosynthesis of natural products. This resource provides a solid foundation for the application of highly active and stable P450s in microbial cell factories to biosynthesize natural products.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0738-8551	1549-7801		WOS:000751742500001	35129020

Formic acid is used to probe the adsorption properties of surface sites, and formates are common intermediates in many catalytic reactions. Here we focus on the interaction of FA with a prototypical anatase TiO2(101) surface by using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS), electron-stimulated desorption (ESD), and density functional theory (DFT) to assess the coverage-dependent evolution of different FA-derived surface species at low temperatures (80-240 K). We find that isolated FA adsorbs at 80 K in both monodentate (MD) and bidentate (BD) configurations on top of undercoordinated Ti sites (Ti-5c). The MD form is likely deprotonated and readily converts upon annealing to deprotonated bridging BD on two neighboring Ti-5c sites. DFT calculations show that molecularly bound MD FA is metastable and readily converts to a deprotonated state in the proximity of subsurface oxygen vacancy. The stability of the MD species increases as the availability of the paired Ti-5c sites for BD formation diminishes at high coverages. Upon surface saturation, a mixed configuration of alternating MD and BD species with a coverage of 2/3 FA/Ti-5c represents the most favorable configuration. This is in contrast with the adsorption of FA on rutile TiO2(110) and many other oxides, where bidentate formate species dominate.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000574908200037

X-ray crystallographic structural analyses revealed that compound 1 is a binuclear Mo-S-glycinate complex, a glycinate ligand is coordinated to each molybdenum atom through its amine nitrogen and carboxylato, oxygen, respectively, and the third glycinate acts as a bridge through its two carboxylato, oxygens linking the two molybdenum atoms. Compound 2 is also a binuclear Mo-S complex with two nitrilotriacetate ligands, each of which is coordinated to a molybdenum atom via its two beta-carboxylato oxygens and a nitrogen atom. Simultaneously, each molybdenum atom in 1 and 2 is chelated to a terminal oxygen and two bridging sulfurs to complete the octahedral configuration. Their catalytic activities in the reduction from C2H2 to C2H4 as well as other binuclear Mo-S-polycarboxylate complexes, a [Fe4S4] single cubane and a chainlike Mo-Fe-S compound were investigated and it was found that 1 exhibited relatively good catalytic activity.

J	AHLGREN, E; POULSEN, FW								THERMOELECTRIC-POWER OF YSZ								SOLID STATE IONICS				70				528	532		10.1016/0167-2738(94)90366-2				MAY-JUN 1994	1994	Thermoelectric power of an yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) thermocell, Pt\YSZ\Pt, has been determined at 1273 K in different atmospheres. The atmospheres used have been mixtures Of O-2-inert gases, CO-CO2, and H-2-H2O. Oxygen partial pressures ranged between 1 and 10(-21) atm. The yttria content in the YSZ was 8 mol%. The dependence on temperature of the thermoelectric power of YSZ in air has also been measured between 600 and 1100-degrees-C. The thermoelectric power was determined to be 0.486 mV/K in air at 1 atm, the colder end was positive relative to the hotter end. The transported entropy of O-2- in yttria-stabilized zirconia is calculated from a combination of thermodynamic and measurement data and is found to be 33 JK-1 mol-1, independent of oxygen partial pressure and temperature. It is shown that the major contribution to the measured thermoelectric power comes from the entropy change of the electrode reactions. It is possible, from the thermoelectric power of a YSZ thermocell, experimentally to determine approximative values of the single electrode reversible heat evolution in an SOFC. These calculations give that 60 kJ/mol e- will be evolved at the cathode when air is the cathode gas and 41 kJ/mol e- will be consumed at the anode in a mixture of 98% H-2 and 2% H2O, at 1273 K when the total gas pressure at both cathode and anode is 1 atm.					9th International Conference on Solid State Ionics9th International Conference on Solid State Ionics	SEP 12-17, 1993SEP 12-17, 1993	DELFT UNIV TECHNOL; UNIV TWENTE; MINIST ECON AFFAIRS (NETHERLANDS); ROYAL NETHERLANDS CHEM SOC; INT SCI FDN, NEW YORK; ELECTROCHEM SOC INC, HIGH TEMP MAT DIV; NETHERLANDS AGCY ENERGY & ENVIRONM; NETHERLANDS ENERGY RES FDN; ELSEVIER SCI PUBL B V; TNO; DSM; BURGOMASTER & ALDERMAN THE HAGUE; INT SOC SOLID STATE IONDELFT UNIV TECHNOL; UNIV TWENTE; MINIST ECON AFFAIRS (NETHERLANDS); ROYAL NETHERLANDS CHEM SOC; INT SCI FDN, NEW YORK; ELECTROCHEM SOC INC, HIGH TEMP MAT DIV; NETHERLANDS AGCY ENERGY & ENVIRONM; NETHERLANDS ENERGY RES FDN; ELSEVIER SCI PUBL B V; TNO; DSM; BURGOMASTER & ALDERMAN THE HAGUE; INT SOC SOLID STATE ION	THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDSTHE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS	29	1	0	0	0	0	30			0167-2738			WOS:A1994NY91100087

In this report, we compare the photocatalytic activity and selectivity for bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) microcrystals with different morphologies to partially oxidize methane to methanol. Bipyramidal BiVO4 microcrystals comprising {102} and {012} surface facets were found to be both more active and more selective for methane to methanol conversion compared to platelet microcrystals that expose {001} facets as their top and bottom surface. The selectivity of the bipyramidal BiVO4 microcrystals for methanol production was over 85% for reaction times between 60 and 120 min with mass activity between 112 and 134 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) during this period. These activities are among the highest reported for photocatalytic methane to methanol conversion using illumination conditions comparable to solar irradiation and without the need for sacrificial reagents. Photochemical deposition of metal salts indicates that photoexcited electrons and holes react selectivity at different facets of the platelet and bipyramidal BiVO4 microcrystals. Combining the photodeposition results with surface energy calculations, we propose that the high selectivity for methanol observed using bipyramidal BiVO4 microcrystals arises due to efficient extraction of photoexcited holes from surfaces that have intermediate reactivity for oxidation.									49	5	0	0	4	0	50			2574-0970			WOS:000461401300019

One way to increase the performance is to increase the electrochemically active surface area available for the oxygen evolution reaction. In this study, we use high ion flux, low energy helium plasma exposure to nanostructure sputtered iron thin films. Subsequent annealing in air at 645 degrees C leads to the formation of PEC active hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) phase in these films. The surface area, as derived from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), was seen to increase 10-40 times with plasma exposure. The photocurrent density increased by 2-5 times for the plasma exposed films as compared to the unexposed films. However, the less nanostructured film showed a higher photocurrent density. These findings were explained by detailed chemical and structural characterization in combination with electrochemical characterization and attributed to the presence of secondary elements in the film as well as to the presence of secondary iron oxide phases apart from hematite. This work demonstrates the complex effect of plasma exposure on both film morphology and chemical composition of PEC thin films and provides further understanding on how this technique can be used for nanostructuring of other functional films.

An integrative approach using advanced analytical electron microscopy techniques (UHR FE-SEM, HR-TEM, and BF/HAADF-STEM, coupled with EDX) in combination with spectroscopy allowed the determination of the structural characteristics of this composite nanomaterial. Advanced imaging clearly revealed the tubular structure of the MnO2 nanotubes (diameter of 30-80 nm and length of 3-5 mu m) and the arrangement of the discrete Co3O4 deposits (10-40 nm). Remarkably, high-resolution and spherical aberration-corrected STEM imaging allowed for the determination of the crystalline arrangement of the nanomaterials, particularly at the interface between MnO2 and Co3O4 particles with high spatial sub-Angstrom resolution, revealing the distribution and high structural consistency of the novel composite materials produced. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy confirmed that MnO2 corresponded to the crystallographic phase cryptomelane (K-2-xMn(8)O(16)), while the dopant cobalt nanoparticles adopted a cobaltite (Co3O4) phase. We demonstrated the catalytic properties of the composite MnO2-Co3O4 nanotubes as an electrocatalyst material for oxygen evolution, where it showed superior behaviour, with a significantly higher catalytic activity (6.8 times) than pure MnO2 in the OER region.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1466-8033			WOS:000400423400008

However, the fabrication of arrays usually suffers from complicated synthetic routes and the indispensable use of substrates. Herein, a novel BiOX/Bi/BiOX (X = Cl, Br) double-side nanosheet array catalyst, with vertically aligned BiOX nanosheets symmetrically grown on the two sides of horizontal Bi nanoplates, is first constructed by a facile solution-phase solvothermal route in the absence of any substrates. Both l-cysteine and ethylene glycol are found to play critical roles in the formation of Bi nanoplates and the growth of BiOX nanosheets. Thanks to the synergism of double-side metal-semiconductor array, BiOX/Bi/BiOX presents significantly boosted performance for photocatalytic selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, far surpassing Bi/BiOX and pristine BiOX. Additionally, BiOX/Bi/BiOX also exhibits superior photoelectrocatalytic performance with excellent hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction activity. The electrochemical analysis and photoluminescence results reveal that the middle Bi nanoplate can function as a fast transport channel for photogenerated electrons, significantly accelerating the separation of photogenerated carriers. This work provides a general substrate-free strategy to construct array catalysts with double-side structure and reveals the outstanding advantages toward improved photocatalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-7350			WOS:000800842800001		
J	Ye, Xieweiyi; Xue, Yakun; Li, Kaijia; Tang, Wen; Han, Xiao; Zhang, Xibo; Song, Zhijia; Zheng, Zhiping; Kuang, Qin								Design of ternary Pt-CoZn alloy catalysts coated with N-doped carbon towards acidic oxygen reduction								MATERIALS ADVANCES				2	16			5479	5486		10.1039/d1ma00475a		JUL 2021		AUG 21 2021	2021	Improving the activity and durability of Pt-based electrocatalysts used in the acidic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a great task for the commercial application of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells. Alloying with transition metal elements is one of the most promising strategies, but it is still accompanied by poor catalyst durability due to the leaching of transition metal components. Herein, we report a facile pyrolysis approach for fabricating N-doped carbon-coated Pt-based ternary alloy nanoparticles (Pt-CoZn@NC) by using Co/Zn-based bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate framework-encapsulated Pt nanoparticles (Pt@CoZn-ZIF) as precursors. After optimizing the experimental conditions, the Pt-CoZn@NC-800-10% catalyst exhibited outstanding activity (E-1/2: 0.917 V vs. RHE) and stability (E-1/2 after 5000 cycles: 1 mV), which are superior to those of binary Pt-based alloy catalysts (i.e., Pt-Co@NC and Pt-Zn@NC) and commercial Pt/C catalysts in the acidic ORR. Such enhanced performances are attributed to the favourable ternary alloy structure, which promoted electronic interactions among metal species (Pt, Co, and Zn). A ZIF-derived NC matrix helps to improve the conductivity and catalytic durability due to an increased number of active sites. This work provides a feasible strategy for preparing efficient and stable Pt-based ternary alloy ORR electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2633-5409		WOS:000679985100001

The platinum skin (Ptskin) is in situ deposited on the surface of Pd nanoparticle in the electrospun Pd/ C catalyst layer. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping of the cross-section of a single fiber confirms that the distribution of Pd/C@ Pt-skin catalysts and Nafion1 ionomer matches well in the E-U electrode. The high porosity and large electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of the E-U electrode mitigates the oxygen transfer resistance. The peak power density of the E-U electrode arrives at 0.62 W cm(-2) with a Pt loading of 19 mg cm(-2), which is higher than that of the conventional electrode (0.55 W cm(-2)) with a Pt loading of 100 mg cm(-2). The degradation rate of peak power density of the E-U electrode is only 4.8% after accelerated stability test (AST) for 30000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles, demonstrating a better durability than that of the conventional electrode. The enhanced durability of the E-U electrode is attributed to nanofiber structure and interaction between Pd and Pt in the Pd/C@ Pt-skin catalyst.

We investigated herbicide binding to monomeric and dimeric photosystem II core complexes (PSIIcc) isolated from Thermosynechococcus elongatus by a combination of different methods (isothermal titration and differential scanning calorimetry, CD spectroscopy and measurements of the oxygen evolution) yielding binding constants, enthalpies and stoichiometries for various herbicides as well as information regarding stabilization/destabilization of the complex. Herbicide binding to detergent-solubilized PSIIcc can be described by a model of single independent binding sites present on this important membrane protein. Interestingly, binding stoichiometries herbicide:PSIIcc are lower than 1:1 and vary depending on the herbicide under study. Strong binding herbicides such as terbutryn stabilize PSIIcc in thermal unfolding experiments and endothermically binding herbicides like ioxynil probably cause large structural changes accompanied with the binding process as shown by differential scanning calorimetry experiments of the unfolding reaction of PSIIcc monomer in the presence of ioxynil. In addition we studied the occupancy of the Q(B) sites with plastoquitione (PQ9) by measuring flash induced fluorescence relaxation yielding a possible explanation for the deviations of herbicide binding from a 1:1 herbicide/binding site model.

Enlightened by mimicking natural Z-scheme photosynthesis, the artificial visible light-driven water splitting photocatalyst of NiO/carbon dots/BiVO4(NiO/CDs/BiVO4) composite was constructed. The designed NiO/CDs/BiVO4 as all-solid-state Z-scheme photocatalyst exhibits efficient photocatalyatic activity for overall water splitting without any cocatalysts or scavengers. In the Z-scheme system, the NiO and BiVO4 can respectively act as H-2 evolution and O-2 evolution photocatalysts, while the CDs can serve as solid electron mediator. The optimal NiO/CDs/BiVO4 photocatalyst shows the H-2 and O-2 production rates of 1.21 and 0.60 mu mol.h(-)(1), respectively, with the CDs concentration in the composite of 5 wt% and the mass ratio of NiO to BiVO4 of 3. The incorporation of CDs employed as the solid-state electron mediator boosts the effective electron transfer and charges separation, resulting in the improved photocatalytic activity of the designed Z-scheme system.									55	6	0	0	9	0	55			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000450105700013

We characterized the physiological H-2 consumption/evolution reactions in mutants having deletions of the structural genes of two hydrogenases in various combinations. This made possible the separation of the functionally distinct roles of the three hydrogenases. Data showed that Hox hydrogenase (unlike the Hup and Hyn hydrogenases) catalyzed the dark fermentative H-2 evolution and the light-dependent H-2 production in the presence of thiosulfate. Both Hex(+) and Hup(+) mutants demonstrated light-dependent H-2 uptake stimulated by CO2 but only the Hup(+) mutant was able to mediate O-2-dependent H-2 consumption in the dark, The ability of the Hex(+) mutant to evolve or consume hydrogen was found to depend on a number of interplaying factors including both growth and reaction conditions (availability of glucose, sulfur compounds, CO2, H-2, light). The study of the redox properties of Hox hydrogenase supported the reversibility of its action. Based on the results a scheme is suggested to describe the role of Hox hydrogenase in light-dependent and dark hydrogen metabolism in T roseopersicina BBS. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, developing extremely capable catalysts to enhance catalytic behavior and mitigate oxidation-reduction overpotential of LOBs is of huge challenge and significance. Attributable to their economically friendly and great activity, transition metal oxides (TMO) have incurred lots of attention as alternative electrocatalysts to replace the currently used noble metal-based catalysts. In this work, we fabricate a highly efficient TMO (the MIL-88A heated at 500 degrees C under protective flow, M8-Fe3O4@NC-500) electrocatalyst as advanced cathodes, which attributed to its unique structure, numerous dendritic-shaped carbon layer was anchored inplane into the micrometer-long spindle-shaped prisms with evenly distribution and contains abundant Fe-N/Graphitic N active sites. Therefore, the LOBs (based on M8-Fe3O4@NC500/AB cathode) deliver superior electrochemical performance with large specific capacities of 14866.1 mAh g(-1), low overpotentials (1.31 V), and steady cycling stability (553 cycles, limited 500 mAh g(-1), under 0.05 mA cm(-2)). Our work provides a novel vision to rationally design and synthesize a powerful TMO electrocatalyst (with the 2D carbon nanosheet coating) for the LOBs cathode.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1359-8368	1879-1069		WOS:000703009700002

The films were obtained via potentiostatic deposition at potential values ranging from -2.25 to -2.75 V. The mechanism of the electrodeposition involved reactions with the used electrolyte and with traces of water as sources of oxygen and hydrogen, as interpreted from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The photoactivity of the deposits deceased at potential -2.75 V. The highest observed photocurrent was ca. 60 pA/cm2 and it was registered in organic solution. The band gap energies determined by XPS technique were approximately 2.5, 2.3 and 3.7 eV for films electrodeposited at -2.25, -2.5 and -2.75 V, respectively. The depth profiles of Si, 0 and Fl in the films were registered by glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GD-OES), which showed that the film thickness was ca. 0.4 mu m. The n-type photoactivity was associated with oxygen evolution from the aqueous solution (0.1 M HClO4, pH 1), whereas the time instability as a function of time observed for the photocurrent was associated with morphological changes of the films as seen by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and their oxidation detected by XPS and FTIR spectroscopies.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000456759300039

It is demonstrated on various chiral monolayers, in which their conversion efficiency is limited. On the other hand, relatively high spin polarization (SP) is observed on bulk chiral materials; however, their poor electronic conductivities limit their application. Here, the design of chiral MoS2 with a high SP and high conductivity is reported. Chirality is introduced to the MoS2 layers through the intercalation of methylbenzylamine molecules. This design approach activates multiple tunneling channels in the chiral layers, which results in an SP as high as 75%. Furthermore, the spin selectivity suppresses the production of H2O2 by-product and promotes the formation of ground state O-2 molecules during the oxygen evolution reaction. These potentially improve the catalytic activity of chiral MoS2. The synergistic effect is demonstrated as an interplay of the high SP and the high catalytic activity of the MoS2 layer on the performance of the chiral MoS2 for spin-dependent electrocatalysis. This novel approach employed here paves way for the development of other novel chiral systems for spintronics and spin-dependent electrochemical applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2198-3844		WOS:000794240800001	35481673	
J	Cui, Zhenhai; Nian, Yue; Zhang, Ao; Zang, Jian; Zhu, Yanshu; Ruan, Yanye; Fan, Jinjuan; Zhang, Lijun								Exogenous Malate Application Inhibits the Photochemical Activity of Photosystem II in Rice Leaves								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND BIOLOGY				17	6			1265	1269		10.17957/IJAB/15.0029				2015	2015	Malate is a carrier that transfers CO2 and NADPH from mesophyll cells (MC) to vascular bundle sheath cells (BSC) in C-4 plant photosynthesis. It likely plays a key role in regulating photosystem II (PSII) photochemical activity. We used the C-3 plant rice to study the effect of exogenous malate (200 mu M) from roots on PSII activity. The malate treatment increased leaf malate content, NADPH/NADP ratio, and the initial fluorescence yield (F-0) and decreased photosynthetic oxygen evolution, the maximum fluorescence (F-m), the maximal efficiency of PS II photochemistry (F-v/F-m), and the number of active PSII reaction centers per excited cross section (RC/CSm). Malate treatment also increased the initial fluorescence yield (F-0') and decreased the maximum fluorescence (F-m') and maximal efficiency of PS II photochemistry (F-v'/F-m') from light-adapted leaves. Based on these results, we concluded that higher concentrations of exogenous malate inhibit photosynthesis and PSII photochemical activity, perhaps in part because of the rise in NADPH/NADP ratio in chloroplasts in C-3 rice plants.

Spectrally Resolved Emission Measurements from Pyrolyzing Ablators in an Inductively Coupled Plasma Facility								55th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting								25 pp.	25 pp.						2017	2017	The pyrolysis mechanics of Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablators (PICA) makes it a valued material for use in thermal protection systems for spacecraft atmospheric re-entry. The present study of the interaction of pyrolysis gases and char with plasma gases in the boundary layer over PICA and its substrate, FiberForm, extends previous work on this topic that has been done in the UVM 30 kW Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) Torch Facility. Exposure of these material samples separately to argon, nitrogen, oxygen, air, and carbon dioxide plasmas, and combinations of said test gases provides insight into the evolution of the pyrolysis gases as they react with the different environments. Measurements done to date include time-resolved absolute emission spectroscopy, location-based temperature response, and flow characterization of temperature, enthalpy, and enthalpy flux. Flow characterization tests construct a general knowledge of the test condition temperature, composition, and enthalpy. Tests with relatively inert argon plasmas established a baseline for the pyrolysis gases that leave the material. Key pyrolysis species such as CN Violet bands, NH, OH and Hydrogen Alpha (Halpha) lines were seen with relative repeatability in temporal, spectral, and intensity values. Tests with incremental addition, and static mixtures, of reactive plasmas provided a preliminary image of how the gases interacted with atmospheric flows and other pyrolysis gases. Evidence of a temporal relationship between NH and Halpha relating to nitrogen addition is seen, as well as a similar relationship between OH and Halpha in oxygen based environments. Temperature analysis highlighted the reaction of the material to various flow conditions and displayed the in depth material response to argon and air/argon plasmas.					55th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting55th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting	9-13 Jan. 20179-13 Jan. 2017		Grapevine, TX, USAGrapevine, TX, USA	0	0	0		0	0	0					978-1-62410-447-3	INSPEC:16678507

These enzyme forms are detected in vivo under stress conditions and during development at the start of the asexual morphogenetic transitions. CAT-1 heme b is oxidized to heme d by singlet oxygen. Here, we describe functional and structural comparisons of the non-oxidized enzyme with the fully oxidized one. Using a broad H2O2 concentration range (0.01-3.0 M). non-hyperbolic saturation kinetics was found in both enzymes, indicating that kinetic complexity does not arise from heme oxidation. The kinetics was consistent with the existence of two kinds of active sites differing more than 10-times in Substrate affinity. Positive cooperativity for one or both of the saturation curves is possible. Kinetic constants obtained at 22 degrees C varied slightly and apparent activation energies for the reaction of both components are not significantly different. Protein fluorescence and circular dicroism of the two enzymes were nearly identical, indicating, no gross conformational change with oxidation. Increased sensitivity to inhibition by cyanide indicated a local change at the active site in the oxidized catalase. Oxidized catalase was less resistant to hi-h temperatures, high guanidinium ion concentration, and digestion with subtilisin. It was also less stable than the non-oxidized enzyme at an acid pH. The overall data show that the oxidized enzyme is Structurally different from the non-oxidized one. although it conserves most of the remarkable stability and catalytic efficiency of the non-oxidized enzyme. Because the enzyme in the cell can be oxidized under physiological conditions, preservation of functional and structural properties of catalase Could have been selected through evolution to assure an active enzyme under oxidative stress conditions.

However, electrocatalytic materials generally improve one of these properties at the expense of the other. Here, using density functional theory calculations and electrochemical surface science measurements, we explore atomic-level features of ultrathin (hydroxy) oxide films on transition metal substrates and demonstrate that these films exhibit both excellent stability and activity for electrocatalytic applications. The films adopt structures with stabilities that significantly exceed bulk Pourbaix limits, including stoichiometries not found in bulk and properties that are tunable by controlling voltage, film composition, and substrate identity. Using nickel (hydroxy) oxide/Pt(111) as an example, we further show how the films enhance activity for hydrogen evolution through a bifunctional effect. The results suggest design principles for this class of electrocatalysts with simultaneously enhanced stability and activity for energy conversion.									133	4	0	0	9	0	133			2058-7546			WOS:000405744700006

Herein, this paper demonstrates a series of novel multi-TpyCo(2+)-based low-molecular-weight supramolecular hydrogelators and further discovers the spontaneous gelation mechanism by experimental and calculation results. The hydrogen bond and pi-pi conjugation have a synergistic driving effect in gelation. In particular, the hydrogen bond between the free Cl anion and H2O molecules serves as a "bridge bond" to connect nearby structural units, contributing to forming a stronger network structure. Owing to the difference of the spatial confinement effect of the gelator, gelled (Tpy)(x)Co-x displays a conductivity-dependent activity for the oxygen evolution reaction, and (Tpy)(4)Co-4 presents the lowest overpotential of 264 and 301 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. More importantly, with (Tpy)(4)Co-4 as the air cathode, liquid rechargeable Zn-air batteries exhibit an ultrastable cycling stability of more than 1100 h (5500 cycles @2 mA cm(-2)) and a high energy efficiency of 65.3% with negligible performance decay. Moreover, the fabricated (Tpy)(4)Co-4-based quasi-solid-state battery displays a superior stability of 270 h (1 mA cm(-2) at 25 degrees C) and 25 h (0.5 mA cm(-2) at -40 degrees C).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000800274000001		
J	Shen, Shen; Fu, Jia Jia; Wang, Hong Bo								Unravelling the favorable photocatalytic effect of hydrogenation process on the novel g-C3N4-TiO2 catalysts for water purification								DIAMOND AND RELATED MATERIALS				114						108292	10.1016/j.diamond.2021.108292				APR 2021	2021	Exploring desirable and photostable homostructured catalysts is an explosive scientific hotspot for energy crisis and wastewater treatment. Efficient pollutants removal from wastewater is an attractive route to sustainable development. We here present an ideal photocatalyst that incorporates both g-C3N4 and TiO2 sheets (TNs), creating a novel nanomaterial of the type g-C3N4/TNs catalyst. The obtained photocatalyst can accelerate the interfacial charge transfer rate. Subsequently, we prepared 2:1O(-)-g-C3N4/TNs photocatalysts by H-2 treatment, which not only generated more active defects on 2:1O(-)-g-C3N4/TNs surface, but also produced oxygen vacancies. As measured by the degradation of CR (CR), the as-prepared g-C3N4/TNs samples perform outstanding removal properties due to high photocurrent response under visible light irradiation, which are transcend than bulk g-C3N4 or pure TNs separately. Specially, the obtained 2:1O(-)-g-C3N4/TNs catalysts exhibit the highest photocatalytic rate for decomposition of CR (86.7%, 2 h), which was 107.5, 7.167, and 1.43 times higher than that of TNs, g-C3N4, and 2:1 g-C3N4/TNs. The decisive factor in enhancing the photocatalytic ability of this optimal sample is the richly available reaction sites exposed by hydrogenation process.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0925-9635	1879-0062		WOS:000760895600001

They are known to correlate with body mass, but their association with gene (protein) functions is poorly understood. In this study, we collected data on the metabolic rate and lifespan of various organisms and investigated the relationship of these parameters with their genomes. We showed that the proportion of genes in a functional category, but not genome size, was correlated with mass-specific metabolic rate and maximal lifespan. In particular, the proportion of genes in oxic reactions (which occur in the presence of oxygen) was significantly associated with these two biological parameters. Additionally, we found that temperature, taxonomy, and mode-oflife traits had little effect on the observed associations. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering the biological functions of genes when investigating the relationships between genome, metabolic rate, and lifespan. Moreover, this provides further insights into these relationships, and may be useful for estimating metabolic rate and lifespan in individuals and the ecosystem using a combination of body mass measurements and genomic data.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6			2045-2322			WOS:000354090200002	25943793

We present a purification procedure based upon oxidation of the raw material in oxygen atmosphere at elevated temperatures and a subsequent treatment in HCl. It is shown that this procedure results in the removal of the majority of the impurities comprising carbonaceous species and metal catalyst particles. The purification and the evolution of SWCNT material using this procedure are monitored using optical absorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy including electron energy-loss spectroscopy as well as electron diffraction. Furthermore, the method has a sufficiently high yield of about 50% to be applicable for a large-scale purification.									29	0	0	0	2	0	29			0947-8396			WOS:000187132500011

A "two-step" reduction-reoxidation procedure has been used to obtain nanosized ceramic manganite Nd0.70Ba0.30MnO3 (II). The parent microsized manganite Nd0.70Ba0.30MnO3 (I) was prepared by usual ceramic technology in air. Then the sample was annealed in vacuum. The grain size of the reduced sample, determined by scanning electron microscopy, decreased from similar to 5 mu m down to similar to 100 nm. To obtain the oxygen stoichiometry nanosized sample, the Nd0.70Ba0.30MnO2.60 was again annealed in air. It is established that the (I) sample is a pseudocubic perovskite, whereas (II) is tetrahedral as a consequence of Nd3+ and Ba2+ ions as well as the ordering of oxygen vacancies. The (I) sample is a ferromagnet with T-C approximate to 140 K. It has metal-insulator transition at T-MI approximate to 135 K and a peak of magnetoresistance similar to 50% in a field of 9 kOe. For the (II) sample, the critical points of phase transitions move to higher temperatures, T-C approximate to 320 K and T-MI approximate to 310 K. The magnetoresistance of the (II) sample at room temperature (T approximate to 293 K) is about 7% in a field of 9 kOe. The magnetotransport properties are interpreted in the framework of the nanosized effect.					8th International Workshop on Beam Injection Assessment of Microstructures in Semiconductors8th International Workshop on Beam Injection Assessment of Microstructures in Semiconductors	JUN 11-14, 2006JUN 11-14, 2006		St Petersburg, RUSSIASt Petersburg, RUSSIA	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1063-7826	1090-6479		WOS:000246392000004

Herein we report an annealing approach to synthesize binder-free,self-supported heterogeneous copper oxide (CuO) on conductive electrodes for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), producing electrodes with excellent electrocatalytic properties such as high efficiency, low overpotential, and good stability. The catalysts were grown in situ on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) by electrodeposition from a simple Cu(II) salt solution, followed by annealing at a high temperature. Under optimal conditions, the CuO-based OER catalyst shows an onset potential of <0.58 V (vs Ag/AgCl) in 1.0 M KOH at pH 13.6. From the Tafel plot, the required overpotentials for current densities of 0.1 and 1.0 mA/cm(2) are only 360 and 430 mV, respectively. The structure and the presence of a CuO motif in the catalyst have been identified by high-energy X-ray diffraction (HE-XRD), Cu K-edge X-ray absorption (XAS) spectra including X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). To the best of our knowledge, this represents the best catalytic activity for CuO-based OER catalysts to date.									117	3	0	0	6	0	118			1932-7447			WOS:000368754700003

The physical and mechanical properties of the copolymers are similar to those of PMMA, except that the bulk copolymers are slightly crosslinked, and are better than those of PMMA flame retarded to a similar extent by some phosphate and phosphonate additives. Examination of the some of the gaseous products of pyrolysis and combustion, and of chars produced on burning, show that flame retardation occurs in the copolymers by both a condensed-phase and a vapour-phase mechanism. The condensed-phase mechanism is shown to involve generation of phosphorus acid species followed by reaction of these with MMA units giving rise to methacrylic acid units. The methacrylic acid units subsequently form anhydride links, which probably impede depolymerization of the remaining MMA sequences, resulting in evolution of less MMA (the major fuel when MMA-based polymers burn). By undergoing decarboxylation, leading to interchain cyclisation and, eventually, to aromaticisation, the anhydride units are probably also the principal precursors to char.

The reduction process proceeds via proton insertion into the RuO2(110) lattice. For electrode potentials (0 to -50 mV vs standard hydrogen electrode), the layer spacing of RuO2(110) increased, maintaining the octahedral coordination of Ru (SXRD). Continuous proton insertion at -100 to -150 mV leads to the transformation of the lattice oxygen of RuO2 to OH and water, which destroys the connectivity among the Ru-O-6 octahedrons and eventually leads to the loss of crystallinity (SXRD) in the RuO2(110) film at -200 mV accompanied by a swelling of the layer with a well-defined thickness (XRR). During the protonation process, soluble Ru complexes may form. With XPS the transformation of RuO2(110) to a hydrous RuO2 layer is followed, a process that proceeds first homogeneously and at higher cathodic potentials heterogeneously by re-deposition of previously electrochemically dissolved Ru complexes.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			1932-7447			WOS:000459836900007

Results show that cobalt(II) ions do not form complexes with DOPA, whereas can form coordination bonds with PDA oligomers after the initiation of polymerization, leading to irregular shaped complex particles. When both cobalt(II) and Fe(III) ions are present in the polymerization system, Fe(III) ions, which are able to form complexes with DOPA before the initiation of polymerization, play a dominant role in determining the morphology of the complex nanostructure, leading to hybrid complex nanospheres. Furthermore, the Co(II)-Fe(III)-PDA complex nanospheres can be easily converted to mesoporous N-doped carbon nanospheres with embedded CoFe2O4/CoFe nanoparticles. Electrochemical studies suggest that these nanospheres exhibit enhanced bifunctional electrocatalytic performance over commercial Pt/C towards ORR and OER. They also show good stability with steady cycling performance for over 300 cycles when used as a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst in a rechargeable zinc-air battery cell.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000456501100021

The model is an upgrade of a previous one that took into account only fragmentation during the heat up and devolatilization stage. The model calculates the temperature and oxygen profiles within the particle, the evolution of internal porosity as a consequence of both devolatilization and carbon combustion, the mechanical stress caused by temperature gradients, and by volatiles-generated overpressure inside the particles. Eventually the model calculates the probability of rupture of the particle based on the Weibull (1939) theory. The model has been used to simulate heating of coal particles under inert conditions at different heating rates and temperatures showing good agreement with previous work. The model has been further used to simulate heating under oxidative conditions in order to highlight the role of combustion on fragmentation phenomena.					9th Mediterranean Combustion Symposium9th Mediterranean Combustion Symposium	JUN 07-11, 2015JUN 07-11, 2015	Combust Inst; Int Ctr Heat & Mass TransferCombust Inst; Int Ctr Heat & Mass Transfer	Rhodes, GREECERhodes, GREECE	5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0010-2202	1563-521X		WOS:000375480000023		
J	Seewald, JS								Organic-inorganic interactions in petroleum-producing sedimentary basins								NATURE				426	6964			327	333		10.1038/nature02132				NOV 20 2003	2003	Petroleum deposits form as a consequence of the increased temperatures that accompany progressive burial of organic matter deep within sedimentary basins. Recent advances in petroleum geochemistry suggest that inorganic sedimentary components participate in organic transformations associated with this process. Water is particularly important because it facilitates reaction mechanisms not available in dry environments, and may contribute hydrogen and oxygen for the formation of hydrocarbons and oxygenated alteration products. These findings suggest that petroleum generation and stability is influenced by subsurface chemical environments, and is a simple function of time, temperature and the composition of sedimentary organic matter.									375	92	0	0	27	1	456			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000186660800054	14628062

The practical applications of metal-free electrocatalysts in metal-air batteries or fuel cells, nevertheless, have been hampered by their unsatisfactory catalytic performance due to insufficient catalytic active sites. In this work, a novel N-rich graphene nanospheres (NGNs) have been achieved by adopting an edge engineering strategy through annealing the mixture of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and edge-rich graphene nanospheres (GNs) composed of graphene nanoflakes. Benefiting from the exposure of edge defects in the GNs, the N loading surprisingly achieved as high as 14.01 at%. The half-wave potential and limiting current density of the synthesized NGNs-900 catalyst can reach 0.872 V and 4.25 mA cm(-2), respectively, which are superior to that of the commercial Pt/C. Based on the experimental and theoretical results, the synergistic effect of graphitic-N and pyridinic-N in NGNs catalysts has been distinguished as the origin of the boosted ORR performance. This work proposes a facile synthesis strategy to optimize the N-doped carbon-based catalysts for ORR, which have great potential to replace noble-metal catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000814399900001

However, its insufficient durability relatively to its high system cost is a bottleneck of that technology when compared to alkaline water electrolysis. In this work,. the influence of the ageing protocols on PEM WE performances is investigated. From electrochemical and physico-chemical analyses it was found that high temperature degrades the membrane more than the current density does. High F- content from the perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) membrane degradation was found on the cathode side. Such a result supports the 2 e- oxygen reduction reaction mechanism that generates hydrogen peroxide which is known as detrimental compound for the PFSA membranes. The monitoring of the fluoride rate might be a suitable parameter to estimate the membrane thickness change. In our test conditions at 80 degrees C the membrane thinning rate was found to be 25 nm/h using SEM images which was twice the value found from fluoride measurements.

Here, we demonstrate the capacity of a wide-spread, non-native sea anemone to buffer its colony biomass accumulation rate across environments by modulating ramet body size through environmentally dependent growth, fission, and catabolism. In 2015, thermal reaction norms for growth and fission behavior were constructed using clonal lines of the sea anemone Diadumene lineata. In 2018, variation in growth patterns under a factorial cross of temperature level and oxygen availability was examined to test the hypothesis that individual ramet size is regulated by oxygen limitation in accordance with optimal size theory. Across a wide range of temperatures, colonies accumulated a similar amount of biomass despite a radical shift from unitary to clonal growth, supporting fission as a mechanism to buffer growth rates over a range of conditions. Individual body size appears to be regulated by the environment with increased temperature and reduced oxygen modifying fission and mass-specific growth patterns, leading to the production of smaller-bodied ramets in warm conditions. However, whether anemones in common garden conditions reduce individual body size through catabolism or fission depends on the region of origin and may relate to differences in seasonal temperature patterns among coastlines, which influence the energetic benefits of fission rate plasticity.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000496464000006		
J	Vrettos, JS; Stone, DA; Brudvig, GW								Quantifying the ion selectivity of the Ca2+ site in photosystem II: Evidence for direct involvement of Ca2+ in O-2 formation								BIOCHEMISTRY				40	26			7937	7945		10.1021/bi010679z				JUL 3 2001	2001	Calcium is an essential cofactor in the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II (PSII). The removal of Ca2+ or its substitution by any metal ion except Sr2+ inhibits oxygen evolution. We used steady-state enzyme kinetics to measure the rate of O-2 evolution in PSII samples treated with an extensive series of mono-, di-, and trivalent metal ions in order to determine the basis for the affinity of metal ions for the Ca2+-binding site. Our results show that the Ca2+-binding site in PSII behaves very similarly to the Ca2+-binding sites in other proteins, and we discuss the implications this has for the structure of the site in PSII, Activity measurements as a function of time show that the binding site achieves equilibrium in 4 h for all of the PSII samples investigated. The binding affinities of the metal ions are modulated by the 17 and 23 kDa extrinsic polypeptides; their removal decreases the free energy of binding of the metal ions by 2.5 kcal/mol, but does not significantly change the time required to reach equilibrium. Monovalent ions are effectively excluded from the Ca2+-binding site, exhibiting no inhibition of O-2 evolution. Di- and trivalent metal ions with ionic radii similar to that of Ca2+ (0.99 Angstrom) bind competitively with Ca2+ and have the highest binding affinity, while smaller metal ions bind more weakly and much larger ones do not bind competitively. This is consistent with a size-selective Ca2+-binding site that has a rigid array of coordinating ligands, Despite the large number of metal ions that competitively replace Ca2+ in the OEC, only Sr2+ is capable of partially restoring activity. Comparing the physical characteristics of the metal ions studied, we identify the pK(a) of the aqua ion as the factor that determines the functional competence of the metal ion. This suggests that Ca2+ is directly involved in the chemistry of water oxidation and is not only a structural cofactor in the OEC. We propose that the role of Ca2+ is to act as a Lewis acid, binding a substrate water molecule and tuning its reactivity.									144	2	2	0	85	0	148			0006-2960			WOS:000169610100021	11425322

Nonetheless, the phase modulation of iron/nickel phosphides nanocrystals or related nanohybrids remains challenging, and their electrocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) performances are not fully investigated. Here, the phase-controlled synthesis of iron/nickel phosphides nanocrystals armored with porous P-doped carbon (PC) and anchored on P-doped graphene (PG) nanohybrids, including FeP-Fe2P@PC/PG, FeP-(NixFe1-x)(2)P@PC/PG, (NixFe1-x)(2)P@PC/PG, and Ni2P@PC/PG, are realized by thermal conversion of predesigned supramolecular gels under Ar/H-2 atmosphere and tuning Fe/Ni ratio in gel precursors. Thanks to phase-modulation-induced increase of available catalytic active sites and optimization of surface/interface electronic structures, the resultant pure-phase (NixFe1-x)(2)P@PC/PG exhibits the highest electrocatalytic activity for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution in alkaline media. Remarkably, using it as a bifunctional catalyst, the fabricated (NixFe1-x)(2)P@PC/PG parallel to(NixFe1-x)(2)P@PC/PG electrolyzer needs exceptional low cell voltage (1.45 V) to reach 10 mA cm(-2) water-splitting current, outperforming its mixed phase and monometallic phosphides counterparts and recently reported bifunctional catalysts based devices, and Pt/C parallel to IrO2 electrolyzer. Also, such (NixFe1-x)(2)P@PC/PG parallel to(NixFe1-x)(2)P@PC/PG device manifests outstanding durability for OWS. This work may shed light on optimizing TMPs nanostructures by combining phase-modulation and heteroatoms-doped carbon double-confinement strategies, and accelerate their applications in OWS or other renewable energy options.									28	1	0	0	0	0	28			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000649966400001		
J	Dau, Holger; Haumann, Michael				MIchael, Haumann/A-7087-2013	Dau, Holger/0000-0001-6482-7494			Time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy leads to an extension of the classical S-state cycle model of photosynthetic oxygen evolution								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				92	3			327	343		10.1007/s11120-007-9141-9				JUN 2007	2007	In oxygenic photosynthesis, a complete water oxidation cycle requires absorption of four photons by the chlorophylls of photosystem II (PSII). The photons can be provided successively by applying short flashes of light. Already in 1970, Kok and coworkers [Photochem Photobiol 11:457-475, 1970] developed a basic model to explain the flash-number dependence of O-2 formation. The third flash applied to dark-adapted PSII induces the S3 -> S4 -> S0 transition, which is coupled to dioxygen formation at a protein-bound Mn4Ca complex. The sequence of events leading to dioxygen formation and the role of Kok's enigmatic S-4-state are only incompletely understood. Recently we have shown by time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy that in the S3 -> S0 transition an interesting intermediate is formed, prior to the onset of O-O bond formation [Haumann et al. Science 310:1019-1021, 2005]. The experimental results of the time-resolved X-ray experiments are discussed. The identity of the reaction intermediate is considered and the question is addressed how the novel intermediate is related to the S-4-state proposed in 1970 by Bessel Kok. This leads us to an extension of the classical S-state cycle towards a basic model which describes sequence and interplay of electron and proton abstraction events at the donor side of PSII [Dau and Haumann, Science 312:1471-1472, 2006].									41	1	0	0	23	0	41			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000248806500006	17333506

But some of its shortcomings also limit its development, such as a large band gap and weak catalytic ability under visible light. The photocatalytic performance of titanium dioxide has been improved by doping nonmetal boron (B) and noble metal rhodium (Rh) in the current study. In general, a metal's electron-deficient state can be regarded as the active sites in a hydrogen evolution reaction. The electron-deficient state of Rh delta+ contributes to its high ability to grab electrons. The light absorption range of Rh nanoparticles (NPs) can reach the visible light band. TiO2 with special morphology is synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method, and B-doped titanium dioxide with an oxygen vacancy is obtained by adding a B source into the precursor solution. The influence of nonmetal ion doping on oxygen vacancy is studied. The Rh/B-TiO2-550 photocatalyst is synthesized by depositing Rh NPs onto B-TiO2, and the bifunctional photocatalyst with a visible light response is successfully prepared. The Rh/B-TiO2-550 catalyst shows good performance in the degradation of hydrogen and pollutants produced in the photocatalytic decomposition process. Under the irradiation of a 300 W xenon lamp, the hydrogen production reaches 108.67 mu mol in 3 h, and the degradation effect of OPP reaches 99.48%.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000664557400001

The as-synthesized 1D fiber with a Co/Fe ratio corresponding to a 0.5:1 microfiber (CoFe-LDH0.5 fiber) showed the highest oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity by demanding an overpotential value of 267 mV while the corresponding powder material demands an overpotential value of 312 mV at pH = 14. In addition, the neutral OER activity of the catalysts was also verified in 0.2 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS), and the same CoFe-LDH0.5 fiber demands a lower overpotential value of 300 mV while the CoFe-LDH1 fiber and CoFe-LDH1.5 fiber demand 320 and 340 mV overpotential, respectively. Hence, we have obtained the interesting result that the incorporated 1D fibrous material with lower cobalt content showed a higher activity than the other fibrous materials. A magnetic study shows that the presence of cobalt ions with a lower concentration ensures the higher ferromagnetic (FM) interaction among the cobalt ions which in turn polarize the overall electronic spin of the hydroxide entity. The polarization of the electronic spin results in lowering the energy barrier by omitting the spin inversion barrier.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000859344200001

This work develops a metal-organic framework-engaged replacement-pyrolysis approach to obtain highly dispersed Ru nanoparticles immobilized on the vacancy-rich Ni-NiO@C hollow microsphere (Ru/Ni-NiO@C). Fine annealing at 400 degrees C introduces nickel and oxygen vacancies on Ru/Ni-NiO@C surface, resulting in an improved electrical conductivity and rapid mass-charge transfer efficiency. Ru/Ni-NiO@C with a hollow micro/nanostructure and interconnected meso-porosity favors the maximal exposure of abundant active sites and elevation of hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity. Experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that an electronic effect between Ru and Ni-NiO@C, in conjunction with nickel/oxygen vacancies in the NiO species could synergistically optimize hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and hydroxide binding energy (OHBE). The HBE and OHBE optimizations thus created confer Ru/Ni-NiO@C with a mass activity over 7.75 times higher than commercial Pt/C. Our work may provide a constructive route to make a breakthrough in elevating the hydrogen electrocatalytic performance.(c) 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Herein, a core-shell structure of MoS2 encapsulating Sr-Co perovskite microcrystalline (SC@MoS2) was used to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for degradation of organics. Levofloxacin (LVF) degradation by SC@MoS2/PMS system was improved obviously, and 0.2-SC@MoS2 exhibited the optimized activation for PMS with best LVF degradation performance (97%) within 15 min. In the 0.2-SC@MoS2/PMS system, the dosage of catalyst was the key determinant of LVF degradation. Simultaneously, 0.2SC@MoS2 achieved outstanding reusability and good degradation capacity of different contaminants. The encapsulation of molybdenum disulfide layer facilitated electron transfer between PMS and core-shell structure. According to the EPR analysis and quenching experiments, both radicals (SO4 center dot- and center dot OH), and nonradical (O-1(2)) were involved in the degradation of LVF. Under visible light irradiation, O-2(center dot-)& nbsp;participated in the reaction and enhanced LVF degradation efficiency, because the valence band and conduction band of components are different. Furthermore, the density functional theory (DFT) calculation, intermediates determination and Toxicity Estimation Software Tool (T.E.S.T) analysis provided meaningful support in the degradation pathways and ecological risks of LVF residues.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000780429900003

Meanwhile, an intricate preparation process and inferior catalytic stability limit their widespread applications. Here, a tree-like freestanding electrode (TFE) decorated with a defect-enriched heterogeneous nanostructure is fabricated via a unique one-step rapid electrodeposition combined with a high-frequency pulse current and flow field. For the first time, the finite element method and coarse-graining molecular dynamics simulation collectively reveal that the additive manufacturing condition and growth mechanism of a dendritic self-supporting electrode can be induced through different high-frequency electrical parameters with a flow field. Benefiting from the novel open macro-morphology, abundant heterostructure, and rich oxygen vacancies, the electrode presents the ability for rapid bubble release, available active centers, and optimized charge distribution, leading to the synergistic effect of superior electron conduction and high intrinsic catalytic activity. Consequently, the TFE used as a work electrode illustrates a superb catalytic effect toward overall water splitting, driving a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at a small voltage of 1.49 V. Meanwhile, the TFE exhibits extraordinary pseudocapacitance, delivering an areal specific capacitance of 2732 mF/cm(2) at 100 mA/cm(2) with excellent cycling stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-0485			WOS:000661302000020

To this end, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to predict the lowest energy structure of the defect. Thereafter, the dipole-dipole interaction method was employed to calculate the local vibration modes (LVM) of this lowest energy structure. We found that the CsO2i; defect is characterized by two LVM frequencies at 1064.7 and 1140.1 cm(-1) . These values are quite close to experimental bands of earlier studies at 1048 and 1094 cm(-1) (deviation similar to 1.6 and 4.2%) reported in the literature, both attributed to the CsO2i; defect. Next, infrared Spectroscopy (IR) measurements were carried, out at room temperature (RT), on electron irradiated Si samples. A band at 1048 cm(-1) was observed. It is grown in the spectra upon annealing out of the 830 cm(-1) band of the vacancy-oxygen center (VO) and the 861 cm(-1) band of the carbon interstitial-oxygen interstitial center (CiOi). ;; Furthermore, isochronal anneals were carried out to monitor the evolution of the band. The analysis and examination of the results lead us to suggest that the 1048 cm(-1) band originates from the CsO2i; complex, formed according to the reaction: VO + CiOi -> CsO2i; The other band at 1094 cm(-1) is most probably masked by the very strong band of O; (1107 cm(-1), at RT) in Si.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1369-8001	1873-4081		WOS:000633204900002		
J	Liu, Wenbo; Zhang, Deguang; Wang, Runwei; Zhang, Zongtao; Qiu, Shilun								2D/2D Interface Engineering Promotes Charge Separation of Mo2C/g-C3N4 Nanojunction Photocatalysts for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution								ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES				14	28			31782	31791		10.1021/acsami.2c03421		JUL 2022		JUL 5 2022	2022	The focus of designing and synthesizing composite catalysts with high photocatalytic efficiency is the regulation of nanostructures and optimization of heterojunctions. By increasing the contact area between the catalysts, additional reaction sites can be established and charge carriers can be transferred and reacted faster. Here, two-dimensional (2D) Mo2C is prepared via a novel approach by carbonizing precursors intercalated by low-boiling solvents, and a composite catalyst Mo2C/graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with 2D to 2D structure optimization was synthesized through the self-assembly of 2D Mo2C and 2D g-C3N4. The hydrogen production rate of the photocatalyst at the optimal ratio is 675.27 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), which further exceeds 2D g-C3H4. It is 5.1 times that of the 7 wt % B/2D Mo2C/g-C3N4 photocatalyst and also 3.5 times that of 0.5 wt % Pt/g-C3N4. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the fact that Mo2C as a cocatalyst can rapidly transfer the photogenerated electrons of g-C3N4 to the surface of Mo2C, and the 2D to 2D structure can provide abundant reaction sites for photogenerated electrons to prevent their recombination with holes. This study provides new ideas and techniques for the development of 2D platinum-like cocatalysts and the optimization of nanojunctions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000828400300001	35786834

Herein, we report the growth of highly loaded (47 wt%) NiFe LDH nanodots (ca. 3 nm) on N-doped three-dimensional (3D) macro/mesoporous carbon (nNiFe/3D MPC). The defect-rich mesopores on the wall of 3D MPC are shown to play a critical role in the high-load and size-limited growth of NiFe LDH, by providing abundant adsorption sites for precursor cations to cause instantaneous nucleation, and at the same time acting as confined reactors for size-limited growth. Also by overcoming the conductivity and active site exposure problems of NiFe LDH, the unique structure of nNiFe LDH/3D MPC evokes intimate interfacial coupling of NiFe LDH and N-doped carbon, and enhanced stabilization of the nanodots through space confinement, making it an excellent bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst. It exhibits a record low potential gap of 0.71 V between the OER and ORR in 0.1 M KOH for a single non-precious electrocatalyst, with the OER and ORR activity surpassing those of most of the reported NiFe LDHs and N-doped carbons, respectively, and endows a rechargeable Zn-air battery with high power density and durability.									108	9	0	0	4	0	107			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000443116700032

CHEMISTRYSELECT				2	9			2797	2802		10.1002/slct.201700484				MAR 23 2017	2017	Atoms on charged graphitic carbon surface are relevant to various electrochemical problems, understanding the adsorption and diffusion of adatoms under charging conditions is essential towards using graphene-like materials in electrochemistry. Using density functional calculations, we show that electron or hole doped graphene can strongly change the mobility of H and O adsorbed atoms. Interestingly, charge doping affects the diffusion of H and O in opposite ways, namely, electron doping increases/reduces, while hole doping reduces/increases the diffusion barrier of H/O respectively. Specifically, on neutral graphene the diffusion barriers of H and O are 1.01 and 0.74eV, which are, upon a hole doping level of +5.9 x 10(13) cm(-2), 0.77 and 0.90eV, and upon an electron doping level of -5.9 x 10(13) cm(-2), 1.36 and 0.38eV. Thus, within the harmonic transition state theory, at room temperature, the diffusion rate of O can be decreased or increased by 470 or 1 x 10(6) times, while that of H can be increased or decreased by 1 x 10(4) or 7 x 10(5) times, respectively for the above hole or electron doping density. The difference between H and O atomic transport at charged graphene is interpreted in terms of the difference in geometric and bonding changes upon charge doping.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2365-6549			WOS:000398581000024

The potential energy surfaces for the manipulation as a function of tip position are determined from atomistic modelling of the MgO(001) surface interacting with a Mg terminated MgO tip. These energies are then used to model the dynamical evolution of the system as the tip oscillates and at a finite temperature using a kinetic Monte Carlo method. The manipulation process is strongly dependent on the lateral position of the tip and the system temperature. It is also found that the expectation value of the point at which the vacancy jumps depends on the trajectory of the oscillating cantilever as the surface is approached. The effect of the manipulation on the operation of the NC-AFM is modelled with a virtual dynamic AFM, which explicitly simulates the entire experimental instrumentation and control loops. We show how measurable experimental signals can result from a single controlled atomic scale event and suggest the most favourable conditions for achieving successful atomic scale manipulation experimentally.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000242598200026

Cobalt-iron metal oxide catalysts were synthesized using the microwave-assisted hydrothermal methods by varying the molar ratios of cobalt and iron. When the cobalt to iron ratio was 2:1, its electrolytic cell yielded the onset potential of only 1.56 V at 10 mA cm(-2), which is close to the thermodynamically reversible potential. When its cell potential was at 1.8 V, the cell current density was approximately 130 mA cm(-2). The results of the stability test showed a steady-state cell current density of 130 mA cm(-2) and remained constant for more than 16 h at a continuous cell potential of 1.8 V. Compared with other catalysts, cobalt-iron metal oxide catalysts showed lower overpotential and lower Tafel slope than did conventional precious metal catalysts such as PtO2 and IrO2. Cobalt-iron metal oxide catalysts serve as an inexpensive route to large-scale commercialization through facile synthesis for enhanced electrochemical water splitting.

Herein, flower-like Al0.9/CuO composed of modified CuO nanosheets was synthesized by a hydrothermal synthesis method under the conditions of high alkaline concentration, in which aluminum hydroxide was dissolved and regenerated on CuO nanosheets. The as-obtained flower-like Al0.9/CuO presents a higher faradaic efficiency of multicarbon (C2+) products 77.6% at -0.95 V vs. RHE for eCO2RR in an H-type cell than other flower-like Alx/ CuO and achieves C2+ product faradaic efficiency of 75.2% and partial current density of 752.5 mA cm-2 in a flow cell. Characterization results show that Cu(I)/Cu(0) interface is formed along with the existence of oxygen defects and d-band center shifting toward low-energy region on flower-like Al0.9/CuO compared with traditional CuO nanosheets. Evenly dispersed Cu(0) and oxygen vacancy on the nanosheet promote the absorption and activation of CO2, while Cu(I) adjacent to Cu(0) regulated by aluminum species improves the adsorption of *CO intermediates, beneficial to the C-C coupling to C2+ products in eCO2RR. Therefore, this work provided a strategy to efficiently modulate the distribution of electron and ingredient on the copper based electrocatalyst to improve the performance of C2+ products in eCO2RR.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000804640300005

Meanwhile, understanding the reduction mechanism of CO2 on the catalyst surface is imperative for advancing catalyst design and the eventual industrialization under mild conditions. In this work, the catalytic role of bismuth/copper interface towards CO2RR is elaborately investigated via a combination of near ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS), ambient-pressure scanning tunneling microscopy (NAP-STM) and density function theory (DFT). It is demonstrated that the initial deposition of Bi on Cu results in the formation of Bi-Cu heterogenous structure, while the interface is buried at the thick coverage. Upon CO2 exposure, Bi is oxidized at interface due to the activation of CO2 on Cu sites and subsequent migration of oxygen to Bi, while Cu+ is induced afterwards in annealing acting as the further dissociation site. Compared with the pure Cu(1 1 1), the fraction of oxidation including both lattice and defective oxygen is significantly higher on the Bi/Cu interface, indicating the synergistic effect of BiCu interface in the activation of CO2. Thus, our work clearly reveals the dissociation site evolution of the Bi-Cu bimetallic heterostructure and might promote the design of Cu-based catalysts for advancing thermocatalytic CO2RR.

PCC6803 grown at 25 and 35 degrees C were studied. Hill reactions in cells, thylakoid membranes and purified PSII core complexes were measured at high temperatures or at their growth temperatures after high-temperature treatments. In the presence of 2,5-dichloro-p-benzoquinone as an electron acceptor, which can accept electrons directly from Q(A), the temperature dependence of the oxygen-evolving activity was almost the same in thylakoid membranes and in the purified PSII complexes from cells grown at 25 or 35 degrees C. When duroquinone, which accepts electrons only through Q(B) plastoquinone, was used as an electron acceptor, the temperature dependence was the same for purified PSII core complexes but was different between thylakoids isolated from the cells grown at 25 and 35 degrees C. No remarkable difference was observed in protein compositions between thylakoids and between purified PSII complexes from cells grown at 25 or 35 degrees C. However, the fluidity of thylakoids, measured by electron flow to P700, was affected by the growth temperature. These results suggest that one of the major factors which cause the changes in the thermosensitivity of PSII is the change in the fluidity of thylakoid membranes. As for the acclimation of PSII in thylakoids to high temperatures, one of the main causes is the decrease in the high-temperature-induced formation of non-Q(B) PSII due to the decreased fluidity in the cells grown at 35 degrees C.									27	2	1	0	25	0	31			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:000243131300003	17056616

A rapid decline of the activity of Co/SiO2 catalysts to zero was observed with reduction temperature increasing from 400 to 600 degreesC. This effect could not be simply explained by a sintering of cobalt particles or by the reaction of Co with the support and alloys or compound formation. The TEM, H-2 chemisorption, O-2 uptake, and magnetic measurements revealed that at T-red greater than or equal to 500 degreesC coverage (encapsulation) of the metal with a thin, most probably SiO2, overlayer was likely to be the reason. Both Co/SiO2 catalysts reduced at T-red > 500 degreesC exhibited a higher and growing with reduction temperature resistance to oxidation when exposed to oxygen or air as it was evidenced by oxygen uptake, magnetic data, and decreasing H-2 chemisorption capacity. At higher temperature (greater than or equal to 700 degreesC) the formation of a thicker, easily observable with TEM, SiO2 or SiOx, overlayer covering the Co particles took place. As a consequence, the catalysts reduced at 900 degreesC were nearly insensitive to the exposure to air. Oxygen uptake and magnetic measurements ruled out the hypothesis on the Co-Si solid solution or cobalt silicide formation at least in quantities higher than the reliability limits of the experimental methods used. The sintering of Co particles and the significant growth of the mean size of Co crystallites was observed at reduction temperatures of 800 and 850 degreesC for nonporous and porous silica, respectively. An apparent growth of the cobalt content to 107 and 114% of the initial value was noted after reduction at 700 and 900 degreesC, respectively, for both catalysts studied, probably due to the strong support dehydroxylation and/or partial reduction.

In this work, catalytic effects of Ca(OH)2 on the pyrolysis of coal were investigated by fixed-bed and in-situ pyrolysis time-offlight mass spectrometry. The catalytic pyrolysis reactivity and chemical structure of coal/chars were analyzed by means of TG, XPS, XRD, FTIR, N2 adsorption/desorption and Ex-situ electron paramagnetic resonance. The results showed that the calcium primarily exists in the form of "Ca-organic" structure in coal, and the loading of calcium could promote the release of gas and water and reduce the yield of char and tar during coal pyrolysis. Moreover, the yields of alkyl benzene, phenols, naphthol, and dihydroxybenzene are significantly different under the condition with or without the calcium addition, and the generation of tar and products distribution have an obvious dependency on calcium compounds in coal. It was demonstrated that the Ca(OH)2 could change the thermal reaction process of oxygen-containing functional groups in coal during pyrolysis process, thereby regulating the distribution of pyrolysis products (tar, gas and char). Calcium species has a significant effect on the thermal conversion of phenols and carboxylic acids structure into tar. Finally, the catalytic process of Ca(OH)2 on the pyrolysis of the coal was discussed.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000709517700007

And most important is that half-wave potential and onset potential have barely change after 2000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry. As a result, the porous carbon materials exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity while maintaining high stability in alkaline KOH solution. (c) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In this work, we for the first time came up with a convenient and effective method for selectively etching amphoteric Al and the sulfurization of CoAl-LDH in one step (at room temperature) to synthesize a kind of porous and amorphous CoSx(OH)(y) nanosheet (PA-CoSx(OH)(y)). Compared with CoAl-LDH, and only etched and only sulfurized CoAl-LDH (abbreviated to OE-CoAl-LDH and OS-CoAl-LDH), PA-CoSx(OH)(y) exhibited a much better electrochemical OER activity. Moreover, the OER performance of PA-CoSx(OH)(y) can be further enhanced by being directly loaded on nickel foam (NF). When the current density reached 10 mA cm(-2), the overpotential of PA-CoSx(OH)(y)/NF was only 261 mV. Adjustment of the physical structure and electronic state of the catalyst can significantly improve the electrocatalytic performance. The porous and amorphous properties of PA-CoSx(OH)(y) exposed a large amount of active sites and enhanced the electrocatalytic performance. The synergy effect between S and OH and the oxygen vacancies would regulate the electronic structure of the catalyst. This causes it to have outstanding OER electrocatalytic activity and stability in alkaline medium.									65	4	0	0	0	0	66			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000452482900038

The spontaneous partial replacement of the transition metal by Pt resulted in Pt(Cu)/GC, Pt(Ni)/GC, and Pt(Co)/GC electrodes whose composition and depth profile were obtained by energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and sputter-etch Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). Following electrochemical conditioning (involving electrode exposure to the oxygen and hydrogen evolution potential regimes), all deposits displayed typical Pt Surface electrochemistry in acid solutions. Pt(Cu) catalysts exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation both during voltammetric and constant potential experiments. The behavior of Pt(Ni) and Pt(Co) depended oil the method of assessment; ill short-term voltammetric experiments, they were inferior to pure Pt, whereas in long-term constant potential experiments they outperformed it. The superior methanol oxidation activity of Pt(Cu) among all catalysts tested is interpreted in terms of the effect of Cu, Ni, and Co on methanol dissociative chemisorption and CO poison removal at/from the Pt surface.									182	4	0	0	4	0	183			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000275708600064

Oxygen evolution assays have been used to show that the 33 kDa polypeptide is not assembled into a functional Photosystem II complex in the cytoplasmic membranes. This may be due to the absence of other Photosystem II components.									17	0	0	0	17	0	17			0950-382X	1365-2958		WOS:A1992JC20400011	1630319

Herein, we demonstrate the fabrication of SO42- anions bridged MOF-derived Cu3N-Cu3P heterostructure coated by ultrathin N, P, S-tri-doped carbon (NPSC) on nickel foam (Cu3N-Cu3P/NPSCNWs@NF) via an interface reconstruction strategy. The first-principle simulation demonstrates that both Cu3N, Cu3P and NPSC own good electrical conductivity, suggesting these species can lead to efficient electrocatalytic performance. The remarkable features of high intrinsic conductivity and interfacial heterostructures at Cu3N-Cu3P/NPSCNWs@NF have ensured excellent water splitting electrocatalytic activity with a low potential of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH over 24 h, and additionally the resultant electrode exhibits impressive response for HER with an ultralow potential of 109 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in neutral-pH media over 30 h.									22	2	0	0	2	0	22			2196-0216			WOS:000513102700037

Herein, we report the facile synthesis of hollow Co3O4 microspheres composed of porous, ultrathin (<5 nm), single-crystal-like nanosheets via a novel "self-template" route. The successful preparation of these hollow Co3O4 nanomaterials includes three main steps: (1) the synthesis of solid cobalt alkoxide microspheres, (2) their subsequent self-template conversion into hollow cobalt hydroxide microspheres composed of ultrathin nanosheets, and finally (3) thermal treatment of hollow cobalt hydroxide microspheres into the hollow Co3O4 material. The as-obtained hollow Co3O4 nanomaterial possesses a high BET surface area (similar to 180 m(2) g(-1)), and can serve as an active and stable water oxidation catalyst under both electrochemical and photochemical reaction conditions, owing to its unique structural features. In the electrochemical water oxidation, this catalyst affords a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (a value related to practical relevance) at an overpotential of similar to 0.40 V. Moreover, with the assistance of a sensitizer [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) (bpy 2,2'-bipyridine), this nanomaterial can catalyze water oxidation reactions under visible light irradiation with an O-2 evolution rate of similar to 12 218 mmol g(-1) h(-1). Our results suggest that delicate nanostructuring can offer unique advantages for developing efficient water oxidation catalysts.									182	6	0	0	13	0	183			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000337786700018	24700250

While the oxidation mechanism of coal has not been comprehensively demonstrated. In this work, the oxidation mechanism of carboxyl group, a typical oxygen-functional group of coal, was systematically investigated by preparing a model compound of carboxylated graphene. For direct oxidation of carboxylated graphene (GCM), the onset potential was close to 1.2 V at ambient temperature. The apparent activation energy for hydrogen production was dramatically diminished by electrolysis of GCM slurry. The products analysis indicated that carboxyl groups can be oxidized to CO and CO2 at 90 degrees C around 1.6 V Fe3+ was sufficient to oxidize carboxyl groups to generate Fe2+ at 90 degrees C. The chemical oxidation of carboxyl groups was a first-order reaction accompanied by adsorption, oxidization and desorption stages. In the presence of Fe2+/Fe3+, electrolysis initiated at about 0.5 V. A gentle slope of voltage from 0.6 V to 1.2 V was observed in the continuous electrolysis and the regeneration of Fe2+ became the limiting step for a long period of time. The results are essential to guide the application of CAWE. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0360-5442	1873-6785		WOS:000649666700009

The samples YBCO and SiO2+ YBCO are fabricated by a conventional solid-state reaction method, in ambiance conditions. We analyze these samples using X-ray diffraction (XRD), resonant Raman, environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), and Photoluminescence (PL) as a function of temperature in the range from 77 to 837 K. The XRD confirm that the doped YBCO still displays a perovskite structure with the orthorhombic Pmmm phase. The Rietveld refinement confirms that SiO2 nanoparticles induce not only a strong effect on the oxygen's O(5) and O(8) positions but also an elongation of the unit cell along the c-axis. The PL intensity of pure YBCO is more intense than the doped one that is mainly composed of two bands located at 2.4 eV and 1.88 eV. We simulate the PL intensity with temperature using the Bose-Einstein model with two activation energies corresponding to some specific vibration mode energies. The simulation reveals that the exchange energy between different levels in pure and doped YBCO is conducted by only two vibrations modes that are strongly linked to the oxygen and copper atoms in the YBCO matrix. We determine the evolution of Raman mode frequencies at 340 and 500 cm(-1) with temperature using the Lorentzian function at q = 0 of the Balkanski model.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0350-820X			WOS:000429909100006

The as-prepared birnessite presented three-dimensional microflowers composed of two-dimensional ultrathin nanosheets. Degradation results indicated that the prepared delta-MnO2 possessed excellent abilities for removal of rhodamine B (RhB). Typically, 50 mL of RhB (10 mg L-1) could be degraded completely with a 10 mg sample in 5 min without any additives such as hydrogen peroxide, peroxysulphate or any supplementary means such as microwaves or ultrasound. The samples were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and N-2 gas adsorption-desorption and thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) techniques. The mechanism of the degradation process was proposed and it was discussed that a redox reaction between birnessite and RhB occurred in an acidic environment. Clearly, the as-prepared birnessite provides great potential for the rapid degradation of dyes and organic pollutants. As it has easily available starting materials, a simple method for synthesis and undemanding degradation conditions, the as-prepared birnessite has high practical value in treating environmental pollutants.									29	3	0	0	9	2	30			2046-2069			WOS:000372253200092

Most of the carbonate is calcite cement occurring as patches, nodules and horizons and consisting of equant and/or drusy sparry calcite, pervasive blocky calcite and rare poikilotopic calcite spar. O-18-depleted values (from - 17 to -8 delta parts per thousand) of the CRP-3 carbonates suggest that the precipitating fluids were a mixing between marine and meteoric waters from melting glaciers. The 5 180 record exhibits a number of steps in an upward increasing trend that are thought to reflect the evolution of ice-sheet growth over the late Eocene to early Oligocene in response to a global cooling trend. Low carbonate delta C-13 values in the CRP-3 drillcore suggest that organic reactions have played a significant role in modifying the pore fluid chemistry. Some anomalously light carbon compositions (down to -25 parts per thousand) are interpreted to record methane-derived CO2 addition to the system. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A binuclear Mn-Ca metal center binding one substrate H2O on each ion is proposed to be the minimal unit of the redox center. A model for the water oxidizing metal cluster is built with molecular modeling software (HyperChem 8.0 Pro). Mn, being a transitional metal with variable valency is redox active, while Ca is redox inert. Formation and deprotonation of H2O+ on Mn-III may be favorable compared to Ca. Deprotonation of H2O+ yields a stable species HO- on Mn-IV by transfer of one electron from Mn-III as a consequence of first photoact. Similarly, during second photoact, it may lead to formation of Mn-V = O. The O-O bond may be formed in the third photoact between O on Mn and H2O on Ca. Subsequently, HO2- may be formed, leading to formation of O-2. Molecular models are built for each transition states.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0301-1208	0975-0959		WOS:000308831400004	23077785

When larvae descended from an upper normoxic layer into a lower hypoxic layer, they displayed a characteristic avoidance reaction consisting of a burst of fast swimming that always ended in an upward direction leading the larva away from the hypoxic region. Each swimming burst lasted for approximately 2-3 s, with a maximum speed of approximately 25 mm s(-1), which is approximately four times the maximum swimming speed observed in the normoxic layer. The avoidance reaction was present in larvae from 6 h until 64 h post hatching. At 72 h we observed 50 % mortality as a result of starvation. The avoidance reaction was correlated with the O-2 concentration but not with the Na concentration nor with salinity or with salinity gradients. The avoidance response was observed at O-2 levels ranging from 4.7 to 0.8 mg O-2 l(-1) For all concentrations below 3.8 mg O-2 l(-1), the distribution was significantly different from that observed in normoxic control layers of the same salinity. No avoidance responses were observed at 6.6 mg O-2 l(-1). We propose that the avoidance reaction of larvae of M. beryllina to hypoxic water is an innate behavioural adaptation to the hypoxic conditions present in the estuaries that are the spawning, hatching and nursery grounds of this species.									19	0	0	0	18	0	19			0022-0949			WOS:000083749300017	10504323

Using clean and unpassivated TiH2 based powder compact, together with cleaning effect of in-situ dehydrogenation during heating the powder compact resulted in a low oxygen content of 0.26% in final extrusion consolidated alloy. The nature of cleaning effect during sintering was proved to be a reduction reaction of TiO2 + 4[H] = Ti + 2H(2)O (g). Besides, solution & aging treatment produced a unique composite lamellar microstructure, which mainly consists of fine alpha platelets and beta-transformed structures containing high number density of ultrafine acicular alpha precipitates. Such composite lamellar microstructure gave rise to extra geometrically necessary dislocations during tensile deformation and brought about significant dislocation hardening together with high global strain. Consequently, this Ti-6Al-4 V alloy exhibited a superior ultimate tensile strength of up to 1320 MPa and meanwhile a high elongation to fracture of not less than 12.5%.									30	1	0	0	0	0	31			0921-5093	1873-4936		WOS:000466249400037

It has been proven to be indispensable for proper functioning of the oxygen evolving complex. By interaction with other extrinsic proteins (PsbQ, PsbO and PsbR), it modulates the concentration of two cofactors of the water splitting reaction, Ca2+ and Cl-. The crystallographic structure of PsbP from Spinacia oleracea lacks the N-terminal part as well as two inner regions which were modelled as loops. Those unresolved parts are believed to be functionally crucial for the binding of PsbP to the thylakoid membrane. In this NMR study we report H-1, N-15 and C-13 resonance assignments of the backbone and side chain atoms of the PsbP protein. Based on these data, an estimate of the secondary structure has been made. The structural motifs found fit the resolved parts of the crystallographic structure very well. In addition, the complete assignment set provides preliminary insight into the dynamic regions.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			1874-2718	1874-270X		WOS:000361440100027	25903141

At near-zero gravity, Ra < 600 can be achieved and the effects of convection suppressed. To systematically vary the Ra without varying the mixture stoichiometry, reactor pressure, or vessel size, cool flames are studied experimentally in a closed, unstirred, static reactor subject to different gravitational accelerations (terrestrial, 1g; Martian, 0.38g; Lunar, 0.16g; and reduced gravity, similar to 10(-2)g). Representative results show the evolution of the visible light emission using an equimolar n-butane:oxygen premixture at temperatures ranging from 320 to 350 degrees C (593-623 K) at subatmospheric pressures. For representative reduced-gravity, spherically propagating cool flames, the flame radius based on the peak light intensity is plotted as a function of time and the flame radius (and speed) is calculated from a polynomial fit to data. A skeletal chemical kinetic Gray-Yang model developed previously for a one-dimensional, reactive-diffusive system by Fairlie and co-workers is extended to a two-dimensional axisymmetric, spherical geometry. The coupled species, energy, and momentum equations are solved numerically and the spatio-temporal variations in the temperature profiles are presented. A qualitative comparison is made with the experimental results. (c) 2006 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Due to their high selectivity, low cost, and highly tunable properties, O- and N-doped carbon catalysts are appealing for this process. However, the relative effects of O and N dopants on the catalytic performances of carbon are not well understood. In this work, we present highly active and selective 2e(-) O-2 reduction catalysts based on doped carbon nanohorns (CNH) synthesized by the gas-injected arc-in-water (GI-AIW) method. The effects of O and N dopants incorporated during the synthesis and the post-treatment are investigated. We discovered that the selectivity of CNH may be more sensitive to changes in N dopant than to changes in O dopant. Our doped CNH catalyst exhibits an early onset potential of 0.85 V vs RHE, >80% selectivity, and excellent stability even after 5,000 cycles and 12 h of flow electrolysis. Our gas diffusion device can generate H2O2 at a practical concentration of 56 mM per hour, corresponding to a production rate of 0.74 mol h(-1)g(cat)(-1). These results suggest that regulating both O and N dopants is an effective design strategy for an efficient carbon catalyst, which is essential in the electrosynthesis of H2O2 from O-2.									4	1	0	0	1	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000734199200002

Nanostructured materials are becoming a hot topic of research, especially in electrochemical treatment for environmental applications that is strongly related to the rise of graphene and subsequent 2D materials that emerged in the last ten years. Nano-structuration allows bringing new properties of the materials such as number of active sites and conductivity improvement. It can therefore enhance the heterogeneous catalysis mechanism at electrode surface. This is primordial since it makes increase the rate of electrochemical reactions that can be the rate limiting steps in electrocatalytic treatment. Such advanced materials contribute to make advanced electrochemical processes as "greener" processes than the conventional ones.This paper aims to be a comprehensive, critical, and accessible review of general interest. The literature covers mainly the last ten years' period due to the recent topic, especially the last five years with the considerable increase of number of publications in this period. The contents particularly devote efforts to establish links between the nanostructured-based electrode properties and electrochemical treatment efficiency through the mechanisms involved.

The model is based on a simple set of reactions and contains a single adjustable parameter p (0 & LE; p & LE; 1). The latter is found from Al-27 solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments in the regime where R = x/y & GE; 1, aided by new experiments on the magnesium and zinc aluminosilicate systems. The parameter p decreases linearly as the cation field strength of M+ or M2+ increases, as per the observation previously made for the degree of aluminum avoidance [Lee et al., J. Phys. Chem. C 120, 737 (2016)]. The results indicate that as the cation field strength increases, there are less fourfold coordinated aluminum atoms to contribute toward the glass network, and Al-O-Al bonds become more prevalent in a progressive breakdown of Loewenstein's aluminum avoidance rule. The model gives a good account of the composition-dependent fraction of non-bridging oxygen (NBO) atoms for R & GE; 1, as assessed from the results obtained from solid-state NMR experiments. An extension of the model to (M2O3)x(Al2O3)(y)(SiO2)(1-x-y) glasses leads, however, to an excess of NBO atoms, the proportion of which can be reduced by invoking network-forming fivefold coordinated Al atoms and/or oxygen triclusters. The model provides a benchmark for predicting the structure-related properties of aluminosilicate materials and a starting point for predicting the evolution in the structure of these materials under the extreme conditions encountered in the Earth's interior or in processes such as sharp-contact loading.& nbsp;(c) 2022 Author(s).

Herein, Pd-modified defective HNb3O8 photocatalyst (denote as Pd/HNb3O8-H-2) consisting of dispersive Pd sites and abundant surface oxygen vacancies (V(O)s) was prepared via the thermal treatment of Pd2+-incorporated HNb3O8 in H-2/Ar gas. The existence of Pd favors the formation of V(O)s on HNb3O8, enabling the synchronous construction of Pd and V-O dual active sites. The spectroscopy and photoelectrochemical studies demonstrate the advantages of Pd/HNb3O8-H-2 photocatalyst in promoting the separation and migration of photoinduced charge carries. The Pd/HNb3O8-H-2 photocatalyst exhibits the outstanding performance toward photocatalytic proton reduction coupled with selective benzyl-alcohol oxidation, achieving the optimal production rates of H-2 and benzaldehyde as high as 3.17 and 2.76 mmol.g(cat)(-1) h(-1), respectively. The experimental and theoretical investigations have expounded the synergistic mechanism of Pd and V-O dual active sites in boosting photocatalytic coproduction of H-2 and benzaldehyde.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000706860000005

Based on experiments on electrochromic absorption transients and the reduction rate of the primary electron donor, P-680, it has been speculated that the oscillations of these variables reflect the net charge of the center as calculated from the difference between electron abstraction and proton release into the medium. We compared proton release with electrochromism in thylakoids and core particles, and under variation of the rate of proton release. We found no equivalent of the variations of the extents and the rates of proton release in electrochromism. The oscillatory pattern of the latter reflects the topological properties of the stepped charge storage relative to the position and orientation of electrochromically responsive pigments rather than responding to proton release from the periphery.									21	0	0	0	12	0	21			0014-5793			WOS:A1994PU12400022	7957950	
J	Li, Jun; Ahmed, Raheel; Shi, Huanwei; Wang, Yan								An extension of gases-brine mutual solubility models to include geochemical reactions: Modeling and applications								JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY				249						104030	10.1016/j.jconhyd.2022.104030				AUG 2022	2022	Accurate and quantitative numerical modeling of phase behavior and speciation of gas-water-rock systems is crucial for fluid and rock evolution analysis, and important in scientific research and engineering applications. In our previous work, mutual solubility models of series gases and brine have been developed for wide temperature, pressure and composition ranges. The gas components included CO2, CH4, H2S, N-2 and O-2. The existing experimental data can be reproduced accurately. In this paper, the models are extended to include water-rock interactions by means of a full coupling with the open-source software package PHREEQC. With the new coupled model, the solubility of gases and various minerals can be correctly and reliably reproduced. The pro-posed numerical framework is properly implemented and it can be applied in different scenarios of gas-water-rock interactions. Three practical applications have been investigated: calculation of uranium in situ leaching, CO2 geological storage and natural gas souring are provided in the paper. The application cases have additionally proven the stability and reliability of the proposed model.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-7722	1873-6009		WOS:000814287100003	35671638

In this work, the chiral transition from the epoxidation of (-)-alpha-pinene to alpha-pinene oxide and successive hydrolysis to (-)-pinanediol has been studied as an archetype of the asymmetric catalysis by Raman optical activity (ROA) and the DFT calculation. Minor changes of the absolute configuration of the chiral products from (-)-alpha-pinene to (-)-pinanediol lead to the dramatic variation in ROA spectra indicating that the chirality is delocalized in the whole molecule rather than only concentrated on the chiral centers. The oxygen atom of alpha-pinene oxide contributes strong ROA signals while the two hydroxyl groups of (-)-pinanediol give no apparent contribution to the chirality in terms of ROA signals. Isolation of the two symmetric anisotropic invariants shows that the predominant contribution to the ROA signals stems from the electric dipole-magnetic dipole invariant, and the bond polarizability model is indeed found to be a good approximation for molecules composed of entirely axially-symmetric bonds in alpha-pinene oxide and (-)-pinanediol. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using ROA to sensitively monitor the variation of the chirality transition during the chiral reactions either in the chemical or biological system.									11	1	0	0	2	0	11			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000275385700026	20449393

The FLP-FLCN photocatalyst can effectively oxidize benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with superior selectivity (>99%) under the visible light irradiation conditions. Moreover, a conversion rate of 82.6 mmol/(g h) from toluene to benzaldehyde is achieved after 24 h of photoreaction. The fine structural analysis including synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure and photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemistry signifies that the enhanced photocatalytic activity of FLP-FLCN is mainly contributed from the synergistic electronic coupling at the FLP-FLCN interface. The photogenerated hole-electron pairs and superoxide anion radicals play a crucial role in facilitating the C-H oxidation reaction. In addition, the FLP-FLCN can be reused for at least five cycles to efficiently photocatalytic conversion of benzyl alcohol without obvious loss of photocatalytic activity and microstructures. These findings provide a novel strategy to synthesize a metal-free nanocatalyst for the visible-light-driven photocatalytic conversion of specific organic transformation with high selectivity and superior conversion rate.									15	0	0	0	3	0	15			2168-0485			WOS:000571390000024

The XRD pattern of Co2Mn1O delta (molar ratio of Mn:Co = 1:2) indicates a Co3O4 phase, and most Mn incorporates into Co3O4 lattice to form a solid solution. Minor distributed Mn species occur structure reforming, totally converting to a stable Co-Mn solid solution during oxidation process. Meanwhile, Co2Mn1O delta features a porous core-shell morphology, the core and shell of which are made up of Co-Mn solid solution, giving rise to a high surface area. The optimized synergistic effect of manganese and cobalt improves low temperature reducibility and produces rich surface active Co3+ species and surface-absorbed oxygen over Co2Mn1O delta. As a result, it exhibits a prominent excellent catalytic activity, and delivers good thermal stability in the presence of 5 vol % H2O and 5 vol % CO2. In situ DRIFTs analysis displays the reaction path of C3H8 over Co2Mn1O delta, where dominate intermediate species formate are easily decomposed into CO2. The synthesized porous core-shell Mn-Co-O can be a promising candidate replacing non-noble catalysts toward C3H8 oxidation at low temperature.									16	1	0	0	3	0	16			2168-0485			WOS:000526375000037

However, owing to a lack of active sites, GDY just serves as a catalyst support in the electrocatalytic process, especially OER. Developing a new monomer with highly active centers for GDY is an effective strategy to overcome this unfavorable factor. Herein, a metalloporphyrin-based GDY analogue (Co-PDY) with a unique -conjugated structure was innovatively designed and prepared through a Glaser-Hay coupling reaction on copper foam. Cobalt centers of metalloporphyrin moieties can provide numerous electrocatalytic sites for OER; also, the electrons can be transferred rapidly through the butadiyne linkages in the electrocatalytic process. The expanded pore structure (2.34 nm) of Co-PDY also serves as an effective transmission channel for small molecule diffusion to maintain the following catalytic process. These three factors altogether endow Co-PDY with excellent OER catalytic performance, including a small overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of (99 mV dec(-1)), and promising long-term stability and durability. Meanwhile, the Co-PDY/CF electrode also displayed an acceptable electrocatalytic performance for HER in alkaline media. Profiting from the above characteristics, Co-PDY can be regarded as a promising electrocatalyst for new energy devices.									53	3	0	0	3	0	54			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463824300047

Building an effective Co phosphide/(hydroxide) oxide interface could be a viable way to improve the hydrogen evolution activity of Co phosphide catalysts under alkaline conditions, which however remains unexplored and challenging. In this communication, we report the facile development of a CoP-CeO2 hybrid nanosheet film on Ti mesh (CoP-CeO2/Ti) from easily made Co3O4-CeO2 via a selective phosphidation strategy. In 1.0 M KOH, such CoP-CeO2/Ti achieves a geometrical catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a pretty low overpotential of 43 mV, 27 mV less than that for CoP/Ti. Remarkably, our CoP-CeO2/Ti also shows superior durability over CoP/Ti, suggesting that CeO2 greatly stabilizes the CoP catalyst. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that CoP-CeO2 possesses a lower water dissociation free energy and a more optimal hydrogen adsorption free energy than CoP. This selective phosphidation strategy is universal in engineering the transition metal phosphide/oxide interface for applications.									163	6	0	0	4	0	163			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000423981200008

However, the mild and effective methods for synthesizing cobalt oxide and vacancies are rarely proposed. In this work, via an innovative one-step hydrothermal process, we synthesized Co3O4-based catalyst, which was successively proven rich with oxygen vacancies (V-O) and cobalt vacancies (V-Co). As an electrocatalyst for benzyl alcohol (BA) oxidation, the vacancy-rich Co3O4 on nickel foam (NF) with optimized electronic structure displayed a super high conversion (> 99%) and selectivity (> 99%) for benzoic acid (BAc) with excellent recyclability, representing one of the best Co-based catalysts. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray adsorption near-edge structure (XANES) technologies coupled with density functional theory calculations (DFT) demonstrated the obvious electronic delocalization caused by vacancies not only lowered the adsorption energy of BA and improved the intrinsic activity of catalytic Co sites for faster reaction kinetics, but also narrowed the band gap for better electrical conductivity. This work opens up a new simple synthetic idea to construct the high-performance electrocatalysts by tuning electronic structure.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000604580400010

Development of inexpensive, active, and durable heteroatom doped carbon-based ORR catalysts can lead to significant cost reduction of these electrochemical energy devices, which therefore has recently attracted enormous research attentions. This work reports a three-dimensional porous composite (P-g-C3N4@NH2-CB) for the highly efficient ORR catalyst. P-g-C3N4@NH2-CB was prepared by mixing phosphorus-doped graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (P-g-C3N4 NSs) with NH2-functionalized carbon black (NH2-CB) via a novel self-assembly approach. The NH2-CB was rationally chosen as the spacer that enables the self-assembled with the P-g-C3N4. NSs driven by the electrostatic interaction. The intercalation of NH2-CB induces the transformation of 2-D P-g-C3N4 NSs into a 3-D composites material of higher surface area, thereby exposing more ORR active sites. The P-g-C(3)N4@NH2-CB exhibited a remarkable ORR activity with an electron transfer number of 3.83 and Tafel slope of 89 mV dec(-1) in alkaline electrolyte, which is comparable to the ORR performance on Pt/Vulcan XC-72. It is found that the incorporated P atoms as well as employing NH2-CB spacer not only reduces the overpotential of ORR, but also enhances the ORR activity of carbon nitride-based materials, owing to the synergistic effect between P and N in tri-s-triazine rings of carbon nitrides and the optimum interaction between the oppositely charged P-g-C3N4 and NH2-CB.									52	6	0	0	2	0	54			0743-7463			WOS:000389557400001	27805815

The initial kinetics of catalysis are investigated as a function of [BrO3-], [Ru-Adams], temperature and [anion], where ''anion'' = ClO4- Cl- or Br-. An electrochemical model of heterogeneous redox catalysis, in which the two participating redox couples are both electrochemically irreversible, is used to interpret most of the kinetic data. The observed inhibition of the initial rate of the redox reaction by Cl- and, especially, Br- ions is tentatively attributed to competitive adsorption. In the presence of organic species, such as methanol, ethanol and propan-1-ol, which are more easily oxidised than water by bromate ions, the rate of BrO3- ion reduction is significantly faster, i.e. ca 24-34 times.									26	2	0	0	13	0	28			0043-1354			WOS:A1995RH94500023

In this manner, the evolution of the STO bulk conductivity was tracked at 300 degrees C during STO thin film deposition and during deposition on a quartz cover to isolate illumination effects from deposition effects. These measurements revealed an increasing bulk conductivity during covered measurements. Impedance spectroscopy under applied bias voltages indicates that these changes are not caused by photovoltages but by an enhanced oxygen incorporation compensated by electron hole generation under UV illumination. This enhanced conductivity persists after illumination. The combination of across-plane and in-plane measurements further indicates the formation of a layered system, allowing to estimate conductivity and thickness of the newly formed oxygen vacancy deficient layer. This results in a similar to 30 times more conductive top layer with a thickness of similar to 40 mu m. The driving force induced by the UV illumination which is responsible for this stoichiometry change corresponds to a p(O-2) difference of around six orders of magnitude. Results of in situ measurements show that the real deposition of a thin film leads to a more complex layered system where the growing film interacts with the illuminated top layer of the substrate and possibly introduces additional oxygen vacancies. These changes have a strong influence on any grown thin film either by oxidation/reduction potential or lattice parameter changes. (C) 2020 Acta Materialia Inc.

Oxygen is the third most common element in the Universe. The measurement of oxygen lines in metal-poor unevolved stars, in particular near-UV OH lines, can provide invaluable information about the properties of the Early Galaxy.Aims. Near-UV OH lines constitute an important tool to derive oxygen abundances in metal-poor dwarf stars. Therefore, it is important to correctly model the line formation of OH lines, especially in metal-poor stars, where 3D hydrodynamical models commonly predict cooler temperatures than plane-parallel hydrostatic models in the upper photosphere.Methods. We have made use of a grid of 52 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres for dwarf stars computed with the code (COBOLD)-B-5, extracted from the more extended CIFIST grid. The 52 models cover the effective temperature range 5000-6500 K, the surface gravity range 3.5-4.5 and the metallicity range -3 < [Fe/H] < 0.Results. We determine 3D-LTE abundance corrections in all 52 3D models for several OH lines and Fe I lines of different excitation potentials. These 3D-LTE corrections are generally negative and reach values of roughly -1 dex (for the OH 3167 with excitation potential of approximately 1 eV) for the higher temperatures and surface gravities.Conclusions. We apply these 3D-LTE corrections to the individual O abundances derived from OH lines of a sample the metal-poor dwarf stars reported in Israelian et al. (1998, ApJ, 507, 805), Israelian et al. (2001, ApJ, 551, 833) and Boesgaard et al. (1999, AJ, 117, 492) by interpolating the stellar parameters of the dwarfs in the grid of 3D-LTE corrections. The new 3D-LTE [O/Fe] ratio still keeps a similar trend as the 1D-LTE, i.e., increasing towards lower [Fe/H] values. We applied 1D-NLTE corrections to 3D Fe I abundances and still see an increasing [O/Fe] ratio towards lower metallicites.

Herein, we demonstrate the in situ growth of ultrathin FeFx nanolayers on Fe2O3 photoanodes, acting as a highly efficient OER cocatalyst to accelerate hole transfer for improved PEC activity. By virtue of its ultrathin structure and high electronegativity, ultrathin FeFx not only promotes the rapid hole transfer among the anode/cocatalyst interfaces but also maximizes the contact areas between the electrode and the reactants. As expected, this photoanode exhibits a remarkably improved photocurrent density of 2.4 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V (reversible hydrogen electrode, AM 1.5 G), up to 12 times enhancement with respect to the pristine Fe2O3 sample. Moreover, a notably negative shift (0.1 V-RHE) on the onset potential has been simultaneously achieved. This work represents a new, simple and highly efficient approach to suppress charge recombination and accelerate the hole transfer for water oxidation, which may serve as an alternate candidate for creating high-efficiency PEC water splitting systems.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000448413100004

We tailor catalytic activity of the cathodes by adjustment of morphology of TiOx nanotubular support layer along with variation of RuOx loaded mass and assess its performance using electrochemical methods and wavelet analysis.The highest energy efficiency of hydrogen evolution is observed in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte to be ca. 64% at -10 mA/cm(2) for cathodes of the most developed area, i.e. smaller diameter of tubes, with enhanced RuOx loading. The efficiency is favored by detachment of small hydrogen bubbles what is revealed by wavelet analysis and is expressed in pure noise at wavelet spectrum. At increased current density, -50 or -100 mA/cm(2), better efficiency of composite cathodes is supported by titania nanotubes of larger diameter due to an easier release of large hydrogen bubbles manifested in less periodic events appeared in the frequency region of 5-12 s at the spectra.We have shown that efficiency of the catalysts is determined by a pre-dominant type of hydrogen bubble release at different operation regimes depending on specific surface and a loaded mass of ruthenia.

Life is the most complex outcome of the 13.7 billion years evolution of our Universe. Human has just recently found that life has experienced a long coevolution with its earth environments through the deep geological time. At the beginning of its planetary evolution, Earth lost its highly reduced atmosphere that contained relatively high of hydrogen, ammornia and methane and turned to a secondary atmosphere contained high of carbon dioxide, dinitrogen and water by differentiation. In the first 700 million years with a hot, global climatic temperature, the strong reactions between the water-carbon dioxide atmosphere and the ultramafic crust produced abundant secondary earth materials including clay minerals and carbonates. Those clay minerals migh have catalyzed the indigenous synthesis of organic matter for the prebiotic evolution toward life; while the deposition of massive carbonates sequestrated the atmospheric carbon dioxide that significantly weakened the greenhouse effect and led to the formation of the earliest oceans only ca. 150 million years after Earth's formation. Though the Earth environments before the Later Heavy Bombardment at ca. 4.1-3.8 billion years was already suitable for life to start, the oldest lithological evidence of life is around 3.71 billion years old. The current controversies on the origin of life include two basic questions: hot or cold, gene first or metabolism first. The Hot Origin theory is supported by the observed interactions between hot water and mafic rocks in producing small organic molecules; the Cold Origin theory insists that the cold temperature is essential for the inorganic synthesis of amino acids and the stability of primary genetic materials. On the other side, astronomists prefer that the exogenous input of organic carbon, water and transition metals by comets and meteorites might be a significant contribution to the prebiotic evolution of life in the early time. Life is a star material. All the cosmic evolutionary stages contributed to the emergence and evolution of life on Earth. The Big Bang produced hydrogen, the main sequence evolution of stars cooked carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, silicon and iron, and even supernova, the dramatic ending of massive stars, produced various heavy radioactive isotopes that powers the highly active geodynamic processes of Earth's interior. Hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, silicon and some metals find their usefulness in biochemistry by having chemical reactions with water-carbon based chemical systems. The various extreme conditions on Earth, such as high or low temperatures, strong photo or ionic radiations, high or low pH values, lacking of nutrients, etc., provide constraints for life on the other planets/moons of our solar system, or on the increasing numbers of Earth-like exoplents. In the observable universe, water is the best chemical solvent for life, and only carbon can make the backbone for life. The unique physical properties of water and incomparable biochemical properties of carbon, combined with their high cosmic abundances, strongly suggest life as we can understand should be common in the Universe; and our understanding of extremophiles and the evolutionary pathway of life on Earth suggest that at least microbial life should be common in the Universe.			宇宙创生于大爆炸,在其后的恒星形成和星系演化过程中各种生命所需的元素不断合成.45.6亿年前,太阳系在银河系的宜居带形成并开始演化,与此同时,地球在太阳系的宜居带上开始朝宜居行星演化.在地球的前生命演化阶段水的海洋已经形成,且拥有丰富的简单有机碳化合物、具催化功能的过渡金属化合物及携带能量的氢气、硫化氢和甲烷等.上述各种物质聚集在近地球表面高能、专门化的、封闭的微小地球化学单元中逐渐演化为初步具有生化功能的单元,最终脱离地球化学反应空间的约束而形成能够独立进行能量代谢和遗传物质合成的生命个体.从能量和地球化学的角度看,将氢气/甲烷合成为有机质的生化过程在早期和现代地球上均不难发生,这也是生命自养起源说的基本假设.地球早期还原大气可经由太阳辐射形成简单有机分子,而陨石和彗星也可将星际有机分子输送到地球,因此地球早期的海洋可能是充满简单有机分子和营养盐的环境,此环境支持生命异养起源假说.从前生命有机化学演化到第一个细胞的形成可能只需要很短的时间.虽然目前已知的地球上最古老的微生物化石是35亿年前形成的叠层石,但在地球的海洋形成之时,即38.5亿年前,生命就可能已经存在于地球上了.						2	4	0	0	0	0	4			0023-074X			CSCD:5846323

Furthermore, the effect of the hydrothermal process time (t = 1, 2, and 3 h) for the WO3 photoanode and drop-casting process of the MoS2 nanosheets (4, 8, and 12 times) to obtain the optimum amount of the material (MoS2 and MoOX) for the PEC performance of the WO3/#n-MoS2 and WO3/#n-MoS2-MoOX (n = 4, 8, and 12) photoanodes were investigated. The photocurrent density of the WO3/MoS2-MoOX photoanode was approximately 2.15 mA.cm(2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which was 8.6 and 1.2 times higher compare to pure WO3 and WO3/MoS2 photoelectrodes, respectively. The incident photon current efficiency of the WO3/MoS2-MoOX photoanode is approximately 27.5%, which is a significant improvement over that of bare WO3. The WO3/MoS2-MoOX photoanode produced 54.5 mu molcm(-2) of H-2 and 25.8 mu molcm(-2) of O-2 after 2 h, at 1.23 V vs. RHE and 100 mWcm(-2). The electrochemical kinetics clearly showed that water oxidation reaction was accelerated. The WO3/MoS2-MoOX photoanode, which was developed through simple and facial drop casting of MoS2 nanosheets onto WO3 photoanode, resulted in effective photo-generated carrier separation and enhanced oxygen evolution reactions on the anode surface.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000803691200003

Partial replacement of the original metal cation with another cation, namely, doping, can be used to tailor the ORR activity of perovskite, for which a metal has been exclusively used as the dopant component in the past. Herein, phosphorus is proposed as a non-metal dopant for the cation site to develop a new perovskite family with the formula of La0.8Sr0.2Mn1-xPxO3-delta (x=0, 0.02, 0.05, and 0.1; denoted as LSM, LSMP0.02, LSMP0.05, and LSMP0.1, respectively). Powder XRD patterns reveal that the solubility of phosphorus in the perovskite structure is around 0.05. Rotating ring-disk electrode experiments in the form of linear-sweep voltammetry scans demonstrated the best ORR performance for LSMP0.05, and also revealed close to a four-electron ORR pathway for all four compositions. A chronoamperometric test (9000 s) and 500 cycle accelerated durability test demonstrated higher durability for LSMP0.05 relative to that of LSM and the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst. The higher ORR activity for LSMP0.05 is attributed to the optimised average valence of Mn, as evidenced by combined X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy data. Doping phosphorus into perovskites is an effective way to develop high-performance electrocatalysts for ORR.									20	3	0	0	0	0	21			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000434322000001	29411451

ZIF-L with leaf-like morphology is used as a core, and FeTPP molecules will induce the partial decomposition of ZIF-L. The ZIF-8 shell is formed and encapsulates FeTPP in the yolk-shell structure by adding Zn ions and 2-methylimidazole (Hmim). After pyrolysis, FeCo bimetallic nitrogen doped porous carbon (FeCo-C/N) exhibits ORR performance comparable to commercial Pt/C (20 wt%), with a significant decrease in cost. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the Fe site in FeCo-C/N contributes to the improved ORR performance by reducing the formation energy of *OOH formation. Thus, a Zn-air battery with FeCo-C/N as an electrocatalyst exhibits significantly improved performance (a high peak power density of 397.25 mW cm(-2), and good rechargeable stability). The synthesis strategy presented in this work provides new opportunities for designing yolk-shell structured 2D MOFs for applications in energy conversion and storage.									56	6	0	0	3	0	57			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000536690000051

To fabricate active electrocatalysts, the creation of new structures that can be easily constructed has always been a research interest. Ni-Fe based alloys are generally known as active OER catalyst. However, in this study, a novel Ni-Fe micro/nano urchin-like structure is reported to be active for both HER and OER. This is the first report of the fabrication of this morphology by a fast, one-step, and affordable electrodeposition method as an efficient HER/OER electrocatalyst. The optimized Ni-Fe coating on Cu substrate demonstrated promising HER activity with low overpotentials of-124 and-243 mV at the current densities of-10 and-100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, the fabricated Ni-Fe urchin-like catalyst is highly active toward OER, requiring overpotentials of only 292 and 374 mV to deliver 10 and 100 mA cm(-2). The unique structure of the synthesized coating with an abundant number of micro/nano-scale cones is suggested to play a vital role in the superior HER/OER activity of the catalyst. This article introduces a cost-effective method for the fabrication of a novel urchin-like Ni-Fe alloy as a highly active bifunctional water splitting electrocatalyst.

However, the anion redox reaction brings problems such as poor cycling performance and serious voltage decay, which can be improved by the doping method. Herein, Al3+ cation and (BO3)3-/(BO4)5- polyanion are introduced into the LRM cathode materials to achieve double site occupation and charge regulation of the structure. It results in excellent electrochemical properties, especially in terms of cycling stability. The doped sample shows a discharged capacity of 239 mAh g-1 at 0.01 C after 100 cycles and a capacity retention rate of 92.0 % (higher than 77.9 % of the pristine sample). Through the brand newly-developed in-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, the joint regulation of Al3+ and (BO3)3-/(BO4)5- inhibits the attack of singlet oxygen on the electrolyte and makes the cathode electrolyte interphases (CEI) film more uniform. First-principles calculations show that the introduction of electron holes and the reduction of the covalency between transition metal and O are key factors in the improvement of electrochemical property and structural stability of the modified materials.

As a result, the range of technologies deployed for this application has increased and more recently includes advanced oxidation processes such as photocatalysis. The complexity of lignin is challenging however, and therefore model compounds, which represent key linkages in the native structure, have become crucial as both a tool for evaluating novel technologies and for providing an insight into the mechanism of conversion. Previously, the beta-O-4 dimer, the most abundant linkage found in native lignin, has been extensively used as a model compound. Described herein, however, is the first report of photocatalytic TiO2 technology for the degradation of a beta-5 model dimer. Under low power UV-light emitting diode irradiation, complete degradation of the beta-5 compound (6.3 x 10(-3) mg ml(-1) min(-1)) was achieved along with formation and subsequent removal of reaction intermediates. Investigation into the mechanism revealed within the first 2 min of irradiation there was the formation of a diol species due to consumption of the alkene sidechain. Although the data presented highlights the complexity of the system, which is underpinned by multiple oxidative reaction pathways, an overview of the key photocatalytic processes are discussed including the impact of acetonitrile and role of reactive oxygen species.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2515-7655			WOS:000655316700001

However, it remains unclear how the incorporated Ru catalysts function to enhance the batteries' performance. Herein, we report Ru nanocrystal-catalyzed carbon nanotube-based aprotic Li-O-2 batteries with electrochemical performances that can match or even surpass some of the best literature results. The catalytic mechanism of Ru nanocrystals has been studied by a combination of Coulometry and in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS). It has been found that through the synergy of water additive in electrolyte and Ru-based catalysts, the charging reaction overpotential can be brought down to 0.12 V (usually eta > 1 V). Moreover, an isotope-labeled DEMS study on the electrochemical oxidation of (Li2CO3)-C-13 indicated that Ru nanocrystals also have the capability to decompose Li2CO3, a detrimental by-product formed in almost all aprotic Li-O-2 batteries, at a surprisingly low potential of similar to 3.5 V vs. Li/Li+ (usually > 4.0 V). The capabilities of Ru nanocrystals to decompose Li2O2, LiOH, and Li2CO3 at low voltages, which drastically decreases the degradation of electrode and/or electrolyte, are crucial to achieve outstanding electrochemical performances for Li-O-2 batteries.

Herein, we report a novel strategy for preparation of Co/N doped hierarchical porous carbon microspheres (Co/NHPCMS), via pyrolysis ZIF-67@SA/NaHCO3 microspheres prepared by in-situ growth of ZIF-67 on electrospray Co-SA/NaHCO3 microspheres. ZIF-67 nanocrystals were well distributed on the ions cross-linked alginate/NaHCO3 microspheres. The pyrolysis of ZIF-67@SA/NaHCO3 microspheres could provide abundant active sites and rich porous structure. More importantly, NaHCO3 plays an essential role in obtaining large mesopores and high pore volume, which is benefit to facilitate the diffusion of reactants. With these merits, Co/NHPCMS-600 exhibits an outstanding ORR electrocatalytic performance with a half-wave potential of 0.827 V. Besides, Co/NHPCMS-600 catalyst exhibits superior catalytic stability and tolerance to methanol in the ORR. This work provides a promising route based on sustainable biomass toward high performance electrocatalyst in the field of energy conversion.									23	1	0	0	2	0	23			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000472183900060

Our aerobic life is based on this strategy, mastered by the natural Photosystem II enzyme, using a tetranuclear Mn-oxo complex as oxygen evolving center. Within artificial devices, water can be oxidized efficiently on tailored metal-oxide surfaces such as RuO2. The quest for catalyst optimization in vitro is plagued by the elusive description of the active sites on bulk oxides. Although molecular mimics of the natural catalyst have been proposed, they generally suffer from oxidative degradation under multiturnover regime. Here we investigate a nano-sized Ru-4-polyoxometalate standing as an efficient artificial catalyst featuring a totally inorganic molecular structure with enhanced stability. Experimental and computational evidence reported herein indicates that this is a unique molecular species mimicking oxygenic RuO2 surfaces. Ru-4-polyoxometalate bridges the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous water oxidation catalysis, leading to a breakthrough system. Density functional theory calculations show that the catalytic efficiency stems from the optimal distribution of the free energy cost to form reaction intermediates, in analogy with metal-oxide catalysts, thus providing a unifying picture for the two realms of water oxidation catalysis. These correlations among the mechanism of reaction, thermodynamic efficiency, and local structure of the active sites provide the key guidelines for the rational design of superior molecular catalysts and composite materials designed with a bottom-up approach and atomic control.									72	0	0	0	2	0	72			0027-8424			WOS:000318031900024	23479603

In this study, comparative degradation of norfloxacin (NOR) was investigated in the UV/IOs/Ox systems adopting four different common iron oxides. It was found that the type of IOs would lead to rather different NOR degradation patterns following the order of goethite (alpha-FeOOH) > hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) > maghemite (gamma-Fe2O3) approximate to magnetite (Fe3O4). center dot OH was the main ROS and effects of parameters (dosage of IOs, NOR and Ox, pH) on the pseudo-first-order k(obs)(NOR) were evaluated in the four systems. Results showed that the surface structures of IOs instead of catalyst amounts would be more responsible for the degradation efficiency. Evolutions of center dot OH, H2O2 and Fe2+ indicated the surface interfacial reactions would also contribute for the NOR degradation, but depended on the type of IOs. ATR-FTIR examinations demonstrated that catalytic activity of IOs correlated highly (R-2 = 0.999) with the amounts of bidentate mononuclear iron-Ox surface complex but correlated poorly with the amounts of monodentate mononuclear and outer sphere complexes. Different intrinsic properties of IOs such as the species of surface hydroxyl groups (-OH) would result in changing the proportion of the three surface complexes. Besides, the minor reduction transformation of NOR by the carbon dioxide anion radical (CO2 center dot- ) was verified by density function theory (DFT) calculation, further confirmed the involvement of both center dot OH and CO2 center dot- for NOR degradation.

J	DENISSENKOV, PA								TURBULENT DIFFUSIVE MIXING IN EARLY B-TYPE MAIN-SEQUENCE STARS								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				287	1			113	130						JUL 1994	1994	Recently Gies & Lambert (1992) have reported on results of a composition analysis of a representative sample of early B-type stars. Their primary purpose was to verify a conjecture made earlier by Lyubimkov (1991) that almost every early B-type main sequence star displayed in its atmosphere CN-cycled material, i.e. an enhanced N abundance accompanied by a deficit of C. Though Gies & Lambert have revealed a source of systematic error in Lyubimkov's approach, nevertheless, they did confirm the presence of products of the CN-cycle in some of the B-stars. In the present study the evolution of a 10 M. star has been computed from the initial main sequence up to the first dredge-up phase. Hydrogen burning nuclear reactions have been taken into account in detail. To interpret the available observational data on the N overabundance in B-stars rotationally induced turbulent diffusive mixing has been assumed to operate in the radiative envelope of the stellar models. We have used a prescription for the diffusive mixing given by Zahn (1983). The main results obtained include a theoretical reproduction of the observational correlation between the N overabundance and the relative age of B-stars and a possible explanation of the nature of the microturbulence in atmospheres of B-stars proposed for the first time. It has also been shown that turbulent diffusion can transport Na synthesized in the convective core into the radiative envelope of the star, which could be responsible for the anomalous Na excesses observed in yellow supergiants. Besides that, the abundance ratio Mg-25/Mg-26 in the atmospheres of especially fast rotating stars has been found to decrease strongly enough to be detectable by means of isotopic composition analysis, and its determination could be an observational test for the considered turbulent diffusive mixing.									53	1	0	0	0	0	53			0004-6361			WOS:A1994NV51400019

Here, we report boron-modulated osmium (B-Os) aerogels with rich defects and ultra-fine diameter as a pH-universal HER electrocatalyst. The catalyst shows the small overpotentials of 12, 19, and 33 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic, alkaline, and neutral electrolytes, respectively, as well as excellent stability, surpassing commercial Pt/C. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows that interventional interstitial B atoms can optimize the electron structure of B-Os aerogels and stabilize Os as active sites in an electron-deficient state under realistic working conditions, and simultaneously reveals the HER catalytic mechanisms of B-Os aerogels in pH-universal electrolytes. The density functional theory calculations also indicate introducing B atoms can tailor the electronic structure of Os, resulting in the reduced water dissociation energy and the improved adsorption/desorption behavior of hydrogen, which synergistically accelerate HER.While noble metals can be active electrocatalysts for producing renewable H-2, there are relatively few works examining osmium materials. Here, the authors prepare boron-doped osmium aerogels for H-2 evolution electrocatalysis plus examine the mechanism using computational and in situ characterization.									30	0	0	0	2	0	29				2041-1723		WOS:000764258100012	35241652

In this work a composite of N-doped worm-like carbon with embedded MoFeNi and MoC nanoparticles was prepared via a simple floating catalyst chemical vapour deposition (FCCVD) method. The composite shows high CO2 reduction and evolution activities. When used as a binder-free cathode for Li-CO2 batteries, low overpotential and long cycleability are achieved which are comparable with those of Li-O-2 batteries. The composite produced in this work show promise as a binder-free cathode for lithium-air batteries operated in the presence of O-2 and CO2.									49	2	0	0	3	0	49			2405-8297			WOS:000406777800018

These isoforms, D1:1 and D1:2, confer functional advantages for photosynthetic growth at low and high light intensities, respectively. D1:1, D1:2, and seven point mutations in the D1:2 background that are native to D1:1 were expressed in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We used these nine strains to show that those strains that confer a higher yield of PSII charge separation under light-limiting conditions (where charge recombination is significant) have less efficient photochemical turnover, measured in terms of both a lower WOC turnover probability and a longer WOC cycle period. Conversely, these same strains under light saturation (where charge recombination does not compete) confer a correspondingly faster O-2 evolution rate and greater protection against photoinhibition. Taken together, the data clearly establish that PSII primary charge separation is a trade-off between photochemical productivity (water oxidation and plastoquinone reduction) and charge recombination (photoprotection). These trade-offs add up to a significant growth advantage for the two natural isoforms. These insights provide fimdamental design principles for engineering of PSII reaction centers with optimal photochemical efficiencies for growth at low versus high light intensities.									26	1	0	0	18	0	26			0002-7863			WOS:000332922600051	24548276

Treatment of the excised or rooted youngest adult leaf on 40 mM KNO3, illuminated for 3.5 hrs. greatly increased the leaf NO3- content. The rates of photosynthetic O2 evolution of low-NO3- and high-NO3- leaves were similar at all incident light intensities studied. Thus NO3- had not effect on photochemical reactions, but alternatively depressed the rate of CO2 fixation. Study of photosynthetic carbon flow using C-14 as a tracer, did not show any effect of NO3- on the chloroplast Benson-Calvin cycle reactions. However, important changes in assimilation pathways out of the chloroplasts appeared, such as: decrease of the carbon flow to carbohydrate biosynthesis, 35% decrease of sucrose biosynthesis, to the benefit of malate and the amino acids like aspartate, glutamate, serine and glycine. The 50% deficit of net sucrose synthesis observed after short-term NO3- treatment was due to the simultaneous decrease of CO2 uptake (-21%) and the decrease of C flow to the sucrose-phosphate synthase dependent reaction (-30%). This situation, which appeared immediately after the leaves had been transferred from low to high nitrate nutrition, was probably transient and preceded the slow development of the situation most often described where CO2 fixation increases under high nitrate nutrition and can provide carbon residues for protein as well carbohydrate metabolism.									12	1	0	0	10	0	13			0764-4469			WOS:A1991FJ48700005

The NO cycle takes place in the deepest layer of a H-burning core or shell, when the temperature exceeds T similar or equal to 30 x 10(6) K. The O depletion observed in some globular cluster giant stars, always associated with a Na enhancement, may be due to either a deep mixing during the red giant branch (RGB) phase of the star or to the pollution of the primordial gas by an early population of massive asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, whose chemical composition was modified by the hot bottom burning. In both cases, the NO cycle is responsible for the O depletion.Aims. The activation of this cycle depends on the rate of the N-15(p, gamma)O-16 reaction. A precise evaluation of this reaction rate at temperatures as low as experienced in H-burning zones in stellar interiors is mandatory to understand the observed O abundances.Methods. We present a new measurement of the N-15(p, gamma)O-16 reaction performed at LUNA covering for the first time the center of mass energy range 70-370 keV, which corresponds to stellar temperatures between 65 x 10(6) K and 780 x 10(6) K. This range includes the N-15(p, gamma)O-16 Gamow-peak energy of explosive H-burning taking place in the external layer of a nova and the one of the hot bottom burning (HBB) nucleosynthesis occurring in massive AGB stars.Results. With the present data, we are also able to confirm the result of the previous R-matrix extrapolation. In particular, in the temperature range of astrophysical interest, the new rate is about a factor of 2 smaller than reported in the widely adopted compilation of reaction rates (NACRE or CF88) and the uncertainty is now reduced down to the 10% level.									38	0	0	0	0	0	38			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000295168100066

For this purpose, six electrocatalysts including Graphene Oxide (GO), functionalized reduced graphene oxide with nitrogen and sulfur atoms (N,S-rGO), Zinc-Aluminum layered double hydroxides (ZnAl-LDH), and ZnAl-LDH/N,S-rGO hybrids in three weight ratios of 1:1, 1:3, and 1:5 (the weight ratio of N,S-rGO is 1) are synthesized by the hydrothermal method. The physical properties, morphology, and structure of the synthesized electrocatalysts are determined by using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM), Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDX), the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman analysis. Electrochemical measurements are implemented by using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Linear Scanning Voltammetry (LSV), and chronoamperometric. Also, the electron transfer number is calculated by K-L plot. The obtained results for all samples are compared with the % 20 Pt/C commercial catalyst. Based on the results of the physical tests, in addition to the uniform distribution and the correct deposition of the synthesized electrocatalysts, the particle size also reached the nanometer range. According to the electrochemical results, among the synthesized electrocatalysts, the ZnAl-LDH/N,S-rGO with 1:1 wt ratio has the best electrochemical activity. This result indicates a well synergistic and interaction effect between N,S-rGO and ZnAl-LDH for the ORR. The onset potential is obtained to be similar to 0.01 V vs Ag/AgCl. The average of electron transfer number by this electrocatalyst is 3.60, which indicates that it is close to the 4e pathway for the ORR. The electrocatalytic stability was favorable in the alkaline medium. It can be concluded that the Layered Double Hydroxides (LDHs) improve the electrical conductivity, the electrocatalytic activity, the active surface area, and the stability for the oxygen reduction reaction after the combination with carbon bases. To be clear, the combination of N,S-rGO and ZnAl-LDH with several concentrations has been investigated for the first time on the ORR applications. The sensitivity analysis is implemented to determine the optimal concentration. This study proposes a new approach for using N, S-rGO composite to improve the low electron conductivity of LDHs.

J	BOONE, CW; KELLOFF, GJ; FREEDMAN, LS								INTRAEPITHELIAL AND POSTINVASIVE NEOPLASIA AS A STOCHASTIC CONTINUUM OF CLONAL EVOLUTION, AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO MECHANISMS OF CHEMOPREVENTIVE DRUG-ACTION								JOURNAL OF CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY								14	25					17G	1993	1993	The progression of intraepithelial and postinvasive neoplasia depends on the occurrence of clonal evolution, defined as the continuous development of mutations and selective clonal expansions in the neoplastic cell population. The two continuously repeating events of clonal evolution, mutation and clonal expansion, occur at unpredictable times and locations. Therefore the neoplastic process is best characterized as a stochastic, i.e., probabilistic, continuum. The rate of intraepithelial neoplastic progression is continuously driven by the dosage level of exposure to mutagens and mitogens. For example, in chronic smokers the length of time before development of lung cancer depends on the number of cigarettes smoked per day.A commonly held misconception is that human carcinogenesis develops after an initial short period of mutation followed by a long period of stimulated proliferation (the multistage model). This incorrect idea derives from the sequential nature of the consecutive two- or three-step operational protocols imposed on experimental animal models by the experimenter. In reality, human carcinogenesis develops as the result of simultaneous and continuous exposure to mutagens and mitogens over the entire period of tumor development. A recent example is the finding that the intraepithelial neoplasia of colorectal adenomas continuously progresses through serial waves of mutation and clonal expansion.The rational design of chemopreventive agents should be based on blocking the two parameters which continuously drive neoplasia: mutagenesis and mitogenesis. In addition to blocking exposure, chemopreventive agents may act at many points during activation and DNA adduction of mutagens, or during stimulation of the proliferation signal pathway by mitogens. Based on the chemopreventive strategy of blocking mutagenesis and mitogenesis, chemopreventive agents are classed as either antimutagenic or antimitogenic. A third class, the antioxidants, are both antimutagenic and antimitogenic, and operate by the common mechanism of breaking free radical chain reactions initiated by reactive oxygen species. In the program of the Chemoprevention Investigational Studies Branch, Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, National Cancer Institute, preclinical development of antimutagens, antimitogens, and antioxidants is well under way, and some of these agents are highlighted here.

A strain-guided perforation of graphene through oxidative etching is reported, where nanopores nucleate selectively at the bulges induced by the prepatterned nanoprotrusions underneath. Using reactive molecular dynamics and theoretical models, the perforation mechanisms are uncovered through the relationship between bulge-induced strain and enhanced etching reactivity. Parallel experiments of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of graphene on SiO2 NPs/SiO2 substrates verify the feasibility of such strain-guided perforation and evolution of pore size by exposure of varied durations to oxygen plasma. This scalable method can be feasibly applied to a broad variety of 2D materials (e.g., graphene and h-boron nitride) and nanoprotrusions (e.g., SiO2 and C-60 nanoparticles), allowing rational fabrication of 2D material-based devices.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000481582300001	31419054

Ultrathin and coiled carbon nanosheets (UC-CNS) were successfully synthesized via chemical vapor deposition method using tungsten carbide (WC) as substrate. After the WC@UCCNS was immersed in HF/HNO3/H2O solution, UC-CNS was completely stripped away from the WC substrate without obvious destruction, and possessed coiled edges and more oxygen-containing functional groups for anchoring Pt nanoparticles. Another obtained product (WO3) could be used as a tungsten source to produce UC-CNS repeatedly. The purified UC-CNS, with thicknesses of 3.45-5.61 nm, possessed high specific surface area (547 m(2) g(-1)) and high degree of graphitization (I-G/I-D = 1.43). Pt loaded on the UC-CNS exhibited high electrocatalytic activity and extremely high stability for methanol oxidation reaction even after 14,000 potential cycles. We believe UC-CNS can be widely used in fuel cells and other related green chemical applications.									6	1	0	0	1	0	6			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000532683200022

The enhanced photocatalytic performance of WO3-x powders was systematically investigated. With the reduction temperature increasing, WO3 gradually transformed to the mixture of WO2.9, WO(2.72 )or WO2, while the corresponding morphologies changed from irregular particles to homogeneous nano-sheets and then to larger nano-rods. The nano-sheet sample containing WO2 and WO2.9 exhibits the optimum catalytic activity due to the special heterostructure. In this heterostructure, the conduction band electrons of WO2.9 can occupy the nearest valence band and subsequently combine with the adjacent internal holes in WO2.9 inhibiting the self-recombination of excited electron-hole pairs in WO2.9 to improve the photocatalytic properties.									13	2	0	0	1	0	14			2452-2139			WOS:000497986000016

Herein, we develop a co-catalyst with a 2D lamellar structure, in which MoC quantum dots are embedded in a carbon membrane uniformly (MoC-QDs/C). With the introduction of MoC-QDs/C, the flower-like MoC-QDs/C/ZnIn2S4 composite shows an unprecedented enhancement of photocatalytic performance, compared with that of pure ZnIn2S4. The optimal hydrogen generation rate of MoC-QDs/C/ZnIn2S4 is almost 48 times as much as that of pure ZnIn2S4. Besides, the enhancement mechanism is also demonstrated that MoC-QDs/C can accelerate carriers' separation and decrease the overpotential of hydrogen evolution effectively during the photocatalytic water splitting process. Moreover, this study not only provides a high-efficiency and potential co-catalyst for photocatalytic H-2 production, but also is expected to come up with a new design scheme for a transition metal carbide-containing co-catalyst.									52	4	0	0	2	0	52			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000448412000025		
J	Yan, Bo; Song, Haili; Yang, Guowei								A facile and green large-scale fabrication of single atom catalysts for high photocatalytic H2 evolution activity								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				427						131795	10.1016/j.cej.2021.131795		AUG 2021		JAN 1 2022	2022	Atomically dispersed metal catalysts, which have maximized atom utilization efficiencies, have demonstrated high activities for the Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, there is a lack of simple strategies for the preparation of Single-atom catalysts (SACs). Herein, we report a clean and robust electrochemical method for synthesizing a series of SACs. This methodology employs a Carbon nitride (CN) suspension in pure water as a bath solution and a pure metal target as an easily removable precursor instead of a strong ionic electrolyte. The simplicity of this system facilities the large-scale production and direct use of SACs without any subsequent processing. The mass loading of metal atoms is precisely adjusted using the applied electric field intensity and the processing time. We demonstrate the atomic dispersion and the coordination structure of metal atoms in the prepared SACs using aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The experimental results show that the Ag1/CN SAC exhibits a higher HER activity than that of Pt nanoparticles on CN, even at low mass loadings. For instance, based on metal loading, Ag1/CN exhibits a record-high photocatalytic HER rate of 1688.9 mmol h-1 g- 1metal, much higher than that of Pt nanoparticles (328.5 mmol h-1 g- 1metal), which confirms the super-high utilization efficiency of Ag atoms. Density functional theory calculations and experiments suggest that this high photocatalytic activity was attributable to a reduced H2 evolution barrier, good proton adsorption and H2 desorption properties. This work provides a novel approach for the synthesis of durable SACs with excellent photocatalytic activities.									11	0	0	0	0	0	10			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000718301900002

Pd and Pt are widely used for catalysis owing to their remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward water splitting and fuel cell reactions. Supporting materials play a paramount role in defining electrocatalytic properties such as durability, selectivity, and activity. The conventional supporting material such as carbon black is unable to fit all the requirements under the severe operating conditions of fuel cells due to its poor corrosion resistance and limited mass transport of fuels to active catalyst sites. Nowadays the scientific research is being concentrated on devising different altered carbonic and carbon-free supporting materials for catalysts to improve the catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity of noble metal electrocatalysts. Lately, Pt, Pd and their alloy catalysts supported on modified carbonaceous and carbon-free materials have attracted solid interest owing to their prominent characteristics contributing to the remarkable fuel cell efficacy. Therefore, it is reasonable to explore this theme, regarding a variety of supporting materials, their advantages, drawbacks and future perspectives. In this mini-review, we selectively summarize recent advancements on several types of key supporting materials: carbon (graphene, carbon nanotubes, mesoporous carbon, and doped carbon nanostructures), non-carbon (transition metals oxides, borides, nitrides, and carbides) and hybrid nanocomposites.									25	1	0	0	0	0	26			1002-0071	1745-5391		WOS:000574759700002

This study introduces a nanodomain tungsten oxide (WO3) interface to 1T-WS2, opening a new route for facilitating the transfer of a proton to active sites, thereby enhancing the HER performance. After H2S plasma sulfurization on the W layer to realize nanocrystalline 1T-WS2, subsequent O-2 plasma treatment led to the formation of amorphous WO3 (a-WO3), resulting in a patchwork-structured heterointerface of 1T-WS2/a-WO3 (WSO). Addition of a hydrophilic interface (WO3) facilitates the hydrogen spillover effect, which represents the transfer of absorbed protons from a-WO3 to 1T-WS2. Moreover, the faster response of the cathodic current peak (proton insertion) in cyclic voltammetry is confirmed by the higher degree of oxidation. The rationale behind the faster proton insertion is that the introduced a-WO3 works as a proton channel. As a result, WSO-1.2 (the ratio of 1T-WS2 to a-WO3) exhibits a remarkable HER activity in that 1T-WS2 consumes more protons provided by the channel, showing an overpotential of 212 mV at 10 mA/cm(2). Density functional theory calculations also show that the WO3 phase gives higher binding energies for initial proton adsorption, while the 1T-WS2 phase shows reduced HER overpotential. This improved catalytic performance demonstrates a novel strategy for water splitting to actively elicit the related reaction via efficient proton transport.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000820881000001	35549071

Here, we design and fabricate self-supported hybrid-metal hydroxyl fluoride [CoxFey(OH)F] nanosheet arrays on nickel foam (NF) as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst through a facile one-step hydrothermal method. The experimental results demonstrate that the values of x and y in CoxFey(OH)F can not only regulate the ratio value of M2+/M3+ but also control the morphology, thus providing abundant active sites for water splitting. DFT calculations further disclose that the different ratios of Co and Fe can tune the potential determining step, leading to a reduced energy barrier for electrocatalytic reactions. In particular, Co0.21Fe0.28(OH)F has lower charge transfer resistance, abundant active sites, and a larger electrochemical surface area, which can achieve an overpotential of 195 mV for the OER and 73 mV for the HER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, in 1 M KOH. It can be simultaneously used as both a cathode and anode to form a two-electrode cell for overall water splitting, which requires a low voltage of 1.53 V at 10 mA cm(-2). Further study shows that the reconstruction of the structure and morphology during the OER makes this electrocatalyst show better OER catalytic performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000797047400001

The Ta-doped TiO2 nanorods, prepared by a solvothermal synthesis, underwent nitridation to possess visible-light absorption under mild conditions, even at 623 K under an ammonia flow. The TiO2: Ta/N powders modified with a RuO2 cocatalyst were active under visible light up to 540 nm for water oxidation for producing O-2 in the presence of reversible electron acceptors (IO3- or Fe3+), while TiO2: N exhibited negligible activity. The results of time-resolved infrared absorption spectroscopy indicated that co-doping Ta with N into TiO2 prolonged the lifetime of photogenerated free electrons, leading to high photocatalytic activity. Simultaneous H-2 and O-2 evolution via water splitting was achieved using a combination of RuO2-modified TiO2: Ta/N, Ru-loaded SrTiO3:Rh and an Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple under visible-light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm) and under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight.									71	2	0	0	2	0	71			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000403228200028

At pH 7, porosity evolution was observed to occur at high potentials, above that required for oxygen evolution, and within the nominal domain of the Pourbaix diagram where silver would be expected to form a passivating oxide. Electron microscopy shows that a small pore (similar to 5 nm) NPG is formed over a potential regime of 1.3-2.0 V vs normal hydrogen electrode, but electrochemical measurements show that the specific capacitance of samples over the same voltage range rises nearly threefold. The observations are explained in terms of residual surface oxides passivating the pores behind the dissolution front, which is itself acidified (and thus corrosive) due to an accumulation of protons associated with oxide formation and water dissociation. A model is proposed that is consistent with the electrochemical and microscopy results. This method of fabricating NPG has advantages of simplicity and safety, and the porosity formation mechanism may be extended to other systems.

Burbidge, G.R. Burbidge, A.G.W. Cameron, W.A. Fowler, and F. Hoyle. Significant advances in the intervening years include (a) observations of elemental and a few isotopic ratios in many more extra-solar-system sites, including metal-poor dwarf irregular galaxies, where very little has happened, and supernovae and their remnants, where a great deal has happened, (b) recognition of the early universe as good for making all the elements up to helium, (c) resolution of heavy element burning in stars into separate carbon, neon, oxygen, and silicon burning, with fine tuning of the resulting abundances by explosive nucleosynthesis in outgoing supernova shock waves, (d) clarification of the role of Type I supernovae, (e) concordance between elements produced in short-lived and long-lived stars with those that increased quickly and slowly over the history of the galaxy, and (f) calibration of calculations of the evolution and explosion of massive stars against the detailed observations of SN 1987A. The discussion presupposes a reader (a) with some prior knowledge of astronomy at the level of recognizing what is meant by an A star and an AGB star and (b) with at least a mild interest in how we got to where we currently are.									57	0	0	0	2	0	59			0935-4956			WOS:A1991FR71100001

In this study, we prepare a composite consisting of intermetallic Ni3Fe and NC (NC@NiFe) via simply heating under ammonia and argon mixed gas atmosphere (Ar/NH3), aiming to further increase the nitrogen content. Compared to NC@NiFe, the NH3-derived electrocatalyst has more N atoms which are in the form of pyridinic N in carbon structure, significantly improving the electron transport efficiency and reaction kinetics, and thereby further boosting the electrocatalytic activity. This work demonstrates that the introduction of ammonia gas flow during calcination is a simple and effective strategy to increase the nitrogen content for engineering NC-based electrocatalysts toward high-performance water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000743377000001

Soluble inorganic redox mediators (RMs) like LiI and LiBr have been shown to enhance round-trip efficiency where different solvents can greatly shift the redox potential of the RMs, significantly altering the overpotential during charging, as well as their oxidizing power against the discharge product. Unfortunately, other design requirements like (electro)chemical stability with the electrode as well as reactive discharge products greatly constrain the selection of solvent, making it impractical to additionally design the solvent to provide optimal RM performance. In this work, we demonstrate that interhalide RMs based on LiI/LiBr and LiI/LiCl mixtures can enable tuning of the oxidizing power of the RM in a given solvent. I-Br interhalides I2Br- to IBr2- showed increasing chemical oxidizing power toward Li2O2 and LiOH with increasing Br, and DEMS measurements during charging of Li-O-2 cells demonstrated that these I-Br interhalide RMs led to increased O-2 evolution with respect to LiI and reduced charging potential and CO2 evolution with respect to LiBr.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000758093800001	35099933

Herein, we synthesized an intermetallic (FexCo1-x)(2)B OER catalyst (GB-(FexCo1-x)(2)B) with controllable grain boundary densities by a facile ball-milling method. Benefiting from the modulation of both grain boundary density and electronic structure, the GB-(Fe0.66Co0.34)(2)B supported on reduced graphene oxide shows a low OER overpotential of 221 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 38.2 mV dec(-1). The experimental and theoretical calculated methods demonstrate that the Fe introduction into the intermetallic Co2B catalyst can produce the higher grain boundary density and modulate the electronic structure, respectively.

PCC 6803								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY				248	3			731	740						SEP 15 1997	1997	Two missense mutants, A263P and S264P, and a deletion mutant des-Ala263, Ser264, have been constructed in the D1 protein of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp PCC 6803. All were expected to induce a significant conformational change in the Q(B)-binding region of photosystem II (PSII). Although the des-Ala263. Ser264-D1 mutant accumulated some D1 protein in the thylakoid membrane it was unable to grow photoautotrophically or evolve oxygen. Thermoluminescence and chlorophyll fluorescence studies confirmed that this deletion mutant did not show any functional PSII activity. In contrast, [S264P]D1 was able to grow photoautotrophically and give light-saturated rates of oxygen evolution at 60% of the rate of the wild-type control strain, TC31. The A263P missense mutant was also able to evolve oxygen at 50% of TC31 rates although it did not readily grow photoautotrophically. Thermoluminescence. flash oxygen yield and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements indicated that in both missense mutants electron transfer from Q(A) to Q(B) was significantly impaired in dark adapted cells. However, Q(A) to Q(B) electron transfer could be photoactivated in the mutants by background illumination. Both the A263P and S264P mutants also showed an increase in resistance to the s-triazine family of herbicides although this feature did not hold for the phenolic herbicide, ioxynil. Of particular interest was that the two missense mutants, especially S264P, possessed a slower rate of turnover of the D1 protein compared with TC31 and in vivo contained detectable levels of a 41-kDa adduct consisting of D1 and the alpha subunit of cytochrome b(559). When protein synthesis was blocked by the addition of lincomycin, D1 degradation was again slower in S264P than TC31. The results are discussed in terms of structural changes in the Q(B)-binding region which affect herbicide and plastoquinone binding and perturb the normal regulatory factors that control the degradation of the D1 protein and its synchronisation with the synthesis of a replacement D1 protein.									24	0	0	0	22	0	24			0014-2956			WOS:A1997XX54700013	9342224

Here, a kind of novel noble-metal-free composite photocatalyst with high hydrogen evolution performance was synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method. In the composite, MXene slice with excellent conductivity was used to promote the activity of CdS-MoS2 catalyst. A prominent H-2 generation rate of 9679 mu mnol.g(-1).h(-1) for the ternary composite was obtained under the irradiation of visible light (lambda = 420 nm). It exhibited a great enhancement by a factor of 251.3% in comparison with CdS-MoS2. The exceptional performance of CdS-MoS2-MXene was mainly arised from the high carrier mobility of MXene, which facilitates the separation of photoinduced electron-hole pairs. The present findings would provide a new direction towards exploring MXene-based composite photocatalysts with high photocatalytic performance in water splitting.									104	16	0	0	5	0	106			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000456951700003

Work reported here focuses on the identification of plausible mechanistic pathways from CO2 to various C-1 products including methane. It is found that Fe-N-x sites convert only CO, CO2 and CH2O into methane, whereas CH3OH appears to be an end product. Distinctly different pH dependence of the catalytic CH4 evolution from CH2O in comparison with that of CO2 and CO reduction indicates differences in the proton participation of rate-determining steps. By comparing the experimental observations with density functional theory derived free energy diagrams of reactive intermediates along the CO2 reduction reaction coordinates, we unravel the dominant mechanistic pathways and roles of CO and CH2O during the catalytic CO2-to-CH4 cascades and their rate-determining steps. We close with a comprehensive reaction network of CO2RR on single-site Fe-N-C catalysts, which may prove useful in developing efficient, non-Cubased catalysts for hydrocarbon production.									102	7	0	0	6	0	100			2380-8195			WOS:000475827900023

The test is based on the infrared measurement of either the C-12/C-13 or the O-16/O-17 ratio of red dwarfs in post-common-envelope binaries (PCEBs). In certain cases (main-sequence red dwarf secondaries in PCEBs without planetary nebulae), as well as determining whether or not accretion has occurred during the CE phase, we can determine the amount of mass accreted during the CE phase and hence the initial mass of the red dwarf component prior to the CE phase. In the other cases considered (low-mass red dwarfs in PCEBs and red dwarfs in PCEBs with planetary nebulae), we can only say whether or not accretion has occurred during the CE phase.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0035-8711			WOS:A1995QH16900003		
J	Li Han-Wei; Sun An-Bang; Zhang Xing; Yao Cong-Wei; Chang Zheng-Shi; Zhang Guan-Jun								Three-dimensional PIC/MCC numerical study on the initial process of streamer discharge in a needle-plate electrode in atmospheric air								ACTA PHYSICA SINICA				67	4					045101	10.7498/aps.67.20172309				FEB 20 2018	2018	Streamer, which usually appears at the initial stage of atmospheric pressure air discharge, acts as a precursor of lightning. It also occurs as large discharges (called sprites) in upper atmosphere, far above the thundercloud. The streamer discharge has many potential applications in industry, such as gas or water cleaning, ozone generation, assisted combustion, etc. The streamer discharge is difficult to investigate both experimentally and computationally, because of its non-linear and multi-scale characteristics. Various studies on streamer discharge have been carried out, and some progress has been made. However, some things remain to be further understood, i.e., the law of particles motion and the factors influencing streamer discharge. In this paper, we use a pre-established three-dimensional (3D) particle model (PIC/MCC) to study streamer discharge with a needle-plate electrode in air. To simplify the condition, we only use nitrogen-oxygen mixture to represent dry air, regardless of other components such as CO2, H2O gases, etc. In this model, we take photoionization, attachment and detachment processes into account. The adaptive mesh refinement and adaptive particle weight techniques are used in the code. In order to facilitate the simulation, we artificially put a Gaussian seed right on the top of the needle electrode. We adjust some computational parameters to analyze how the streamer discharge starts and evolves from the needle electrode. Many factors can influence streamer discharge during its evolution, from among which we choose three important parameters: voltage amplitude, gas component, and the radius of curvature of the needle electrode tip, to study the generation and evolution of streamer discharge, and focus on inception cloud, streamer branches, and electric fields. The simulation results show that the radius of inception cloud increases with the increase of voltage amplitude, and the diameter of steamer channel and the number of branches also increase with voltage increasing. We choose 4 kV as a proper simulation voltage for next two parts of simulations. By comparing the results obtained in the cases of different gas components (pure oxygen and different ratios of nitrogenoxygen mixtures), we discover that the nitrogen-oxygen mixture ratio significantly affects the total number of streamer branches. With 0.1% oxygen, discharge grows irregularly with small protrusions on streamers. In the pure oxygen case, streamer seems to have much more thin branches than in other cases. Needle geometry directly changes the inception cloud of the streamer and its morphology, especially when the tip becomes blunter. In this circumstance, electric field strength around the electrode decreases, and inception cloud can be barely seen. Instead, a single-channel streamer discharge develops right toward the plate electrode, later this single-channel streamer splits into branches.									5	6	0	0	0	0	9			1000-3290			WOS:000428113200016

Prominent examples of tuned properties are the local surface plasmon resonance for sensing applications and adsorption energies for applications in catalysis. Laser synthesis of colloidal nanoparticles is well suited for generating alloy nanoparticles of desired compositions. Not only bulk alloys but also compacted mixtures of single-metal micropowders can serve as ablation targets. However, it is still unknown how mixing of the individual metals transfers from the micro- to the nanoscale. This work experimentally contributes to the elucidation of the mixing processes during the laser-based synthesis of alloy nanoparticles. Key parameters, such as the initial state of mixing in the ablation target, the laser pulse duration, the laser spot size, and the ablation time, are varied. Experiments are performed on a cobalt-iron alloy, relevant for application in oxidation catalysis, in ethanol. The extent of mixing in the targets after ablation and in individual nanoparticles are studied by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and by cyclic voltammetry at relevant conditions for the oxygen evolution reaction, as model reaction. The results point at the benefits of well pre-mixed ablation targets and longer laser pulse durations for the laserbased synthesis of alloy nanoparticles.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000737750100030

Herein, dual-cation Fe, Al-co-doped NiSe(2)nanoparticles on reduced graphene oxide (Fe, Al-NiSe2/rGO) were prepared as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. The dual-cation doping can induce a stronger electronic interaction between the foreign atoms and host catalyst, for optimizing the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates. Meanwhile, the leaching out of Al from the crystal structure of the target product during the alkaline wash creates more defects and increases the active site exposure. As a result, the Fe, Al-NiSe2/rGO catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activities for both the OER and HER with an overpotential of 272 mV @eta(10)for the OER in 1.0 M KOH and 197 mV @eta(10)for the HER in 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. A two-electrode electrolyzer using Fe, Al-NiSe2/rGO as the anode and cathode shows a low voltage of 1.70 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This study emphasizes the synergistic contribution of the dual-cation co-doping effect and more defects created by Al leaching to boost the performance of water splitting.									17	1	0	0	1	0	18			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000545253700041	32573626	
J	Kuroda, Yoshiyuki; Nishimoto, Takeshi; Mitsushima, Shigenori				Mitsushima, Shigenori/AAX-9510-2021				Self-repairing hybrid nanosheet anode catalysts for alkaline water electrolysis connected with fluctuating renewable energy								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				323						134812	10.1016/j.electacta.2019.134812				NOV 10 2019	2019	Water electrolysis is a core technology in the conversion of renewable energy to hydrogen, which is useful for energy storage and transportation. Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) is one of the most suitable technologies because of its low cost and applicability to large-scale production of hydrogen; however, the AWE system exhibits electrode degradation under fluctuating electricity from renewable energy such as solar and wind energies. In this study, we demonstrate the use of a hybrid cobalt nanosheet (Co-ns), comprising brucite-type cobalt hydroxide modified with the tripodal ligand tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, to form a highly stable self-repairing catalyst layer on a nickel anode under cycled potential. The Co-ns is functionalized by organic modification as a self-repairing catalyst with high catalytic activity, high dispersibility in an alkaline electrolyte, and protection of the nickel anode from corrosion. The Co-ns supplied from the alkaline electrolyte forms a catalyst layer via the anodic reaction on the surface of the nickel anode. This catalyst layer is detached under cycled potential simulating the fluctuating electricity of renewable energy; however, it is repaired by the constant current electrolysis simulating the steady state operation of AWE. The reaction between the Co-ns and nickel anode strengthens the connection between the catalyst layer and substrate. Furthermore, the Co-ns is less influential to the activity of a commercial cathode, indicating applicability to the conventional AWE system without changing the manifold structure. Consequently, the specially designed Co-ns catalyst shows great potential as a novel self-repairing function in an AWE system, which will enable stable operation under fluctuating electricity from renewable energy.

Ni/CeO2, prepared by a sol-gel method with only one heat treatment step, was used to catalyze methane decomposition for the generation of H-2. The solid byproduct, Ni/CeO2/carbon nanotube (CNT), was further employed as an electrocatalyst in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for H-2 production. The Ni/CeO2 catalyst exhibits excellent activity for methane decomposition because CeO2 prevents carbon encapsulation of Ni nanoparticles during the preparation process and forms a special metal-support interface with Ni. The derived CNTs act as antenna to improve conductivity and promote the dispersion of agglomerated Ni/CeO2. In addition, they provide H-2 diffusion paths and prevent Ni/CeO2 from peeling off the HER electrode. Although long-term methane decomposition reduces the HER activity of Ni/CeO2/CNTs (owing to degradation of the delicate Ni/CeO2 interface), the tunable nature of the synthesis makes this an attractive sustainable approach to synthesize future high-performance materials.									57	7	0	0	1	0	59			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000460682800007	30565883

Control experiments confirm that the optimal nickel content in Ni-C-500 is 16 wt% and the optimum calcination temperature is 500 degrees C. The hydrogen evolution rate on Ni-C-500 in the presence of Eosin Y and triethanolamine (TEOA) reaches 13.5 mmol/g(cat)/h in the first hour, which is even higher than that on commercial Pt/C catalyst (11.4 mmol/g(cat)/h). The carbon support facilitates the transfer of photogenerated electrons from photosensitizer to Ni-based nanocrystals, efficiently preventing the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes during the photocatalytic procedure. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further demonstrate that the NiO islands on Ni(111) surface facilitate the adsorption of water molecules because of the interaction between the oxygen atom of NiO island and the hydrogen atom of water. Furthermore, produced H-ad around NiO island of Ni(111) surface is more easily to form hydrogen on Ni/NiO hybrid nanostructure than on clean Ni(111) surface.[GRAPHICS].									4	1	0	0	0	0	5			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000646490200002

The title oxide combines a fair resistance to corrosion with an optimal band gap E-g of 1.32 eV. The intercalation of a small amount of oxygen should be accompanied by a partial oxidation of Cu+ into Cu2+ implying a p-type semiconductivity. The S2- oxidation inhibits the photocorrosion and the H-2 evolution increases parallel to polysulfides S-n(2-) formation. Most of H-2 is produced when p-CuCrO2 is connected to n-Cu2O formed in situ. H-2 liberation proceeds mostly on CuCrO2 while the oxidation of S2- takes place over Cu2O surface and the hetero system Cu2O/CuCrO2 is optimized with respect to some physical parameters. The photoactivity is dependent on preparation conditions and lowering the synthesis temperature through nitrate route leads to an increase in specific surface area S-sp. The photoelectrochemical H-2 production is a multistep process where the rate determining step is the arrival of electrons at the interface because of their low mobility. Prolonged irradiation (> 80 min) leads to a pronounced decrease of the photoactivity; the tendency toward saturation is due to the undesired back reduction of polysulfides S-n(2-) in a closed system and to their strong absorption in the visible region (lambda(max) = 520 nm).

Despite tremendous efforts on the development of alternative catalysts, platinum (Pt) is still the most efficient catalyst for HERs. Nevertheless, it remains a great challenge to output sufficient catalytic activity with a low Pt loading. In this research, Prussian blue analogues (PBA) of nickel hexacyanoferrate (Ni-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2)) nanocubes were used as the active substrate to enhance the HER activity of Pt by fabricating a Pt-Ni-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) interface. The Ni species of Ni-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) play key roles in contributing to the water dissociation and improving the HER kinetics, as well as helping to maintain the catalytic activity of Pt during a long-term durability test in both acidic and alkaline media. As a result, the new Ni-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2)/Pt hybrid catalyst exhibits a superior catalytic property for HERs in both sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and potassium hydroxide with a low Pt loading of only 4.0%. Impressively, a low overpotential of 59 mV is achieved at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in H2SO4, and a high mass current density of 3.75 mA g Pt-1 is obtained at an overpotential of 70 mV, which outperforms currently reported Pt-based catalysts in acid electrolyte. It is believed that this work will inspire the design of PBA-based hybrid nanomaterials with improved or new functionalities for energy conversion and catalysis applications.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			2052-1553			WOS:000438238300024

In the genome of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 there are two genes, ho1 (sll1184) and ho2 (sll1875), encoding HO isoforms. Reverse transcription-PCR indicated that ho1 is constitutively expressed, and ho2 is induced under micro-oxic conditions. A mutant lacking ho1 (delta ho1) failed to grow under aerobic conditions while it did grow at a significantly slower rate than the wild type under anaerobic (micro-oxic) conditions. When micro-oxically grown delta ho1 was incubated under aerobic conditions, the cells underwent chlorosis with a significant decrease in phycocyanin accompanied by anomalous accumulation of protoporphyrin IX. These results suggested that HO1 is essential for aerobic growth as the sole HO and is dispensable under micro-oxic conditions. A mutant lacking ho2 (delta ho2) grew under both aerobic and micro-oxic conditions like the wild type at low light intensity (50 mu mol(photon) m(-2) s(-1)). At higher light intensity (120 mu mol(photon) m(-2) s(-1)) the delta ho2 mutant showed significant growth retardation under micro-oxic conditions. It is suggested that HO2 operates as a dominant HO under high light and micro-oxic environments and acts as an accessory HO at low light intensity. Constitutive expression of HO2 in a neutral site of the chromosome restored aerobic growth of delta ho1, suggesting that HO2 has an activity high enough to substitute for HO1 under aerobic conditions. The differential operation of two isoforms/enzymes in cyanobacterial tetrapyrrole biosynthesis to adapt to low oxygen environments is discussed, including three other reactions.									25	0	0	0	25	0	26			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:000295932800004	21828104

If this interpretation is correct, we predict a potentially detectable boron abundance for this star: B/H approximately 2 x 10(-12). Subsequent Population II LiBeB observations, and in particular further observations of Population II Li-6, are shown to be crucial to our understanding of the primordial and early galactic creation and destruction mechanisms for light elements.									59	0	0	0	1	0	59			0004-637X			WOS:A1993LW90100009

Under such conditions, bonding patterns established for molecular systems near ambient conditions change dramatically, causing profound effects on numerous physical and chemical properties and leading to the formation of new classes of materials. Representative systems are examined to illustrate key phenomena, including the evolution of structure and bonding with compression; pressure-induced phase transitions and chemical reactions; pressure-tuning of vibrational dynamics, quantum effects, and excited electronic states; and novel states of electronic and magnetic order. Examples are taken from simple elemental molecules (e.g. homonuclear diatomics), simple heteronuclear species, hydrogen-bonded systems (including H(2)O), simple molecular mixtures, and selected larger, more complex molecules.

However, this integration demands spatial charge separation and unique interface properties for a trade-off between oxidation and reduction reactions. In the current work, defect engineering of NiO/SnO2 nanoparticles aided in altering the optoelectronics and interface properties and enhanced photocatalytic activity. After annealing the catalysts in a N-2 atmosphere, the hydroxyl groups were replaced by water molecules through surface modification. The photoexcited holes accumulated on SnO2 break the water molecules and facilitate the reduction of protons on NiO; this is known as spatial separation. Meanwhile, direct hole oxidation, an oxygen reduction reaction, ensures the degradation activity in this 2-fold system. By defect engineering, the limitations of SnO2 such as higher H2O adsorption, wide bandgap (reduced from 3.02 to 1.88 eV), and electronic properties were addressed. The H-2 production in the current work has attained a value of 3732 mu mol/(g h), which is 2.9 times that of the previous best reported under sunlight. Recyclability tests confirmed the stability of vacancies by promoting the reoxidation of defect states during photocatalytic activity. Additionally, efforts were made to study the effect of defect density on the photocurrent, the electrical resistance, and the mechanism of photocatalytic reactions. Electrochemical characterizations, UPS, XPS, UV-DRS, and PL were employed to understand the influence of defects on the bandgap, charge recombination, charge transport, charge carrier lifetime, and the interface properties that are responsible for photocatalytic activity. In this regard, it was understood that maintaining the optimal defect concentration is important for higher photocatalytic efficiencies, as the defect optimality preserves key photocatalytic properties. Apart from characterizations, the photocatalytic results suggest that excess defect density triggers the undesired thermodynamically favored back reactions, which greatly hampered the H-2 yield of the process.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000731384700001	34894647

This process is based on the energy of photons, which is used to split water and use its electrons to reduce carbon atoms to create organic molecules and thus fix the light energy into a chemical form. Two photosytems working in series are involved in light harvesting and conversion. Both are multi-protein supercomplexes composed of a core complex, where the photochemical reaction takes place, and an antenna system involved in light harvesting. In plants and green algae, the antenna of photosystem II, the photosynthetic complex involved in water splitting, comprises the Light Harvesting Complex II (LHCII) trimers, the most abundant membrane protein on earth. LHCII is composed of highly conserved Lhcb isoforms and all green organisms count a high number of Lhcb. In vascular plants they are classified in three distinct subclasses, Lhcb1, 2 and 3, while in algae and non-vascular plants, these isoforms are less differentiated and called Lhcbm proteins. In this review, we compare LHCII proteins of different organisms, from green algae to angiosperms, and discuss the role of the modifications that occurred through evolution. We highlight the various functions of the different isoforms in photosynthesis, ranging from light harvesting, a common role to all these proteins, to regulations of photosynthesis that rely on specific isoforms.									25	0	0	0	22	0	25			1389-2037	1875-5550		WOS:000432470400010	29473498

All the synthesized samples have been successfully characterized by PXRD, SEM, EDX and UV-Visible spectroscopy. All these samples are used for study the photodegradation of methylene blue in aqueous solution under visible light irradiation. It has been found that incorporation of TiO2 NPs and TiO2/Ag2O nanocomposite into Ti(BTC) shifts the band gap towards more visible region, elevates the yield of O2 center dot- and OH center dot- radicals and enhances the photodegradation efficiency of methylene blue in the presence of visible light. Amongst all the synthesized samples, TiO2/Ag2O@Ti(BTC) shows maximum photocatalytic activity towards photodegradation of methylene blue as compared to all other synthesized samples. It is observed that after 60 min, TiO2/Ag2O@Ti(BTC) shows minimum absorption of 0.02 as compared to TiO2 (0.17), TiO2/Ag2O (0.052), Ti(BTC) (0.32) and TiO2@Ti(BTC) (0.21). It reveals that methylene blue has been successfully degraded by synthesized samples and maximum activity has been shown by TiO2/Ag2O@Ti(BTC). Further, electrochemical water splitting activity of these samples has been studied. It has been found that TiO2/Ag2O@Ti(BTC) shows maximum catalytic activity towards both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It generates maximum current density 97.15 and - 110 mA cm(-2) towards both OER and HER, respectively, as compared to all other samples.[GRAPHICS].									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1735-207X	1735-2428		WOS:000584439900001

The films thus prepared are characterized by XRD, SEM, and EDX spectroscopy as a function of deposition time (i.e., 5 min - 20 min). It is remarkably shown that the film growth rate is 0.8 nmSec(-1) using this AACVD method and a commercially available precursor, which is similar to 10 times higher as compared to the electrochemical synthetic routes. As a result, 250 nm thick cobalt oxide films are generated only in 5 minutes of deposition time. The water oxidation reaction for this film started at similar to 0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl with current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is achieved at similar to 0.75 V that corresponds to an overpotential of 484 mV. This current density is further increased to 60 mA cm(-2) at similar to 1.5 V (vs Ag/AgCl). Electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) calculations are also performed which indicated that the synergy between Au-film acting as electron sink and the cobalt oxide film acting as catalytic layer are more pronounced than the surface area effects.

J	NAIR, PM; RAMASWAMY, NK								ISOLATION OF 34-KDA PROTEIN FROM SPINACH-CHLOROPLASTS HAVING FERROXIDASE AND H2O2-DEPENDENT DARK O2 EVOLUTION ACTIVITIES								INDIAN JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY & BIOPHYSICS				28	1			22	29						FEB 1991	1991	A latent form of 'Ferrooxidase' exhibiting ferrocyanide-dependent O2 uptake was detected in the isolated spinach chloroplasts. Presence of a cationic detergent hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) in the medium was essential to induce this activity. The association of this enzyme activity with photosystem II (PSII) particles as well as the ability of PSII particles to show oxidation of H2O2 (catalase like activity) indicated its possible relationship with water oxidation system. The protein catalysing this activity was purified to homogeneity and its molecular mass was found to be 34 kDa. The purified protein showed a complete dependence on an electron acceptor, namely ferricyanide, for the oxidation of H2O2. While with ferrocyanide in the presence of CTAB, the protein exhibits the ferrooxidase activity. For both activities, a sharp pH optima at 6.1 was observed. The k(m) for H2O2 was 12.2 mM. The purified enzyme protein contained 4 atoms of calcium and 2 atoms of iron per mole of the enzyme. Unlike catalase, the enzyme reaction was insensitive to sodium azide even at 500-mu-M concentration. The enzyme was found to be sensitive to metal chelators like ethylene-glycol-bis-(beta-aminoethylether) N, N+ tetra acetic acid (EGTA) (2mM), alpha,alpha-dipyridyl (500-mu-M) and 1,10-orthophenanthroline (200-mu-M). The sensitivity of the reaction to alpha,alpha-dipyridyl and 1,10-orthophenanthroline suggested the involvement of Fe2+ in the reaction. Inhibition of enzyme activity by EGTA and restoration of activity by supplementation of CaCl2 to the EGTA-dialysed sample confirmed the absolute requirement for calcium for this activity. Calcium was absent in the EGTA-dialysed enzyme. Apart from these inhibitors, NaF and NH2OH were potent inhibitors of the enzyme reaction. The K(i) for NaF and NH2OH were 4-mu-M and 1.35 mM respectively. Inhibition of enzyme activity by inhibitors of water oxidation in chloroplasts such as Tris, NH4+, F- and NH2OH indicated the possibility of involvement of this protein in OEC.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0301-1208			WOS:A1991EZ73400004	2055597

The complexes were characterized by spectroscopic methods, molar conductivity measurements, and elemental analysis. The complexes were investigated as water oxidizing catalysts by several electrochemical techniques. Our findings revealed that the nature of the central metal ion plays an essential role in the stability of the complexes and their electrocatalytic activity. Although all modified electrodes with complexes showed good activities for water oxidation compared with bare carbon paste electrode, nevertheless, NiL showed a much superior electrocatalytic activity in basic solution in terms of onset potential and Tafel slope. Experiments indicated that at pH = 11, NiOx is probably a heterogeneous catalyst for the oxidizing of water in the presence of NiL. However, about CoL, it was revealed that a high valent cobalt oxo intermediate is active in the electrocatalytic process. On the other hand, field-emission scanning electron microscope images showed the formation of nanorods on the electrode surface. However, upon our observations, it was difficult to determine the real role of CoL in the water oxidation reaction. Surprisingly, the results indicated that CuL is not stable under electrochemical conditions, and after performing the amperometry for a long time, its electrocatalytic activity decreases.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			0268-2605	1099-0739		WOS:000607784400001

In this minireview, we examine the state-of-the-art strategies for tailoring PCNs for efficient photocatalytic, electrocatalytic, and photoelectrochemical water oxidation, including heteroatom doping and interface engineering from band structure alignment (e.g., by coupling inorganic or organic semiconductors) to hybridization with nanoscale cocatalysts (e.g., nanosheets, nanoarrays, nanoparticles, and quantum dots) and sub-nanoscale cocatalysts (e.g., metallic molecular clusters and single-atom catalysts). Through establishing the structure-activity correlations, we aim to present a clear roadmap for providing insights into the design strategies, structure modification, and the improved catalytic performances of PCN-based materials in different catalytic water oxidation processes. For future guidance, we also propose some outlooks on the perspective and challenges of PCNs towards a better application in catalytic water oxidation.									22	1	0	0	6	0	22			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000524947900004	32196063

The photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of Pt(111)/TiO2 was 1.6 times higher than that of Pt(poly)/TiO2. The corresponding apparent activation energy on Pt(111)/TiO2 was about 2.39 KJ/mol, while on Pt(poly)/TiO2, it was about 4.83 KJ/mol. The difference in the apparent activation energies was probably due to the diversity in the number of surface atoms at corners and edges between the Pt(poly) and Pt(111) nanoparticles. The photocurrent of Pt(111)/TiO2 was also bigger than that of Pt(poly)/TiO2, implying that the surface structure of Pt(111) nanoparticles can improve the transfer efficiency of photo-induced electrons from the conduction band of TiO2 to Pt nanoparticles. As a result, the surface structure of Pt nanoparticles played an important role in the reactivity and kinetics performance of hydrogen evolution. Therefore, the photocatalytic properties of Pt/TiO2 strongly depended on the surface structure of Pt nanoparticles.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1687-4110	1687-4129		WOS:000376910200001

Here, we developed a thermo-photo catalytic process with a visible-light-responsive Pt/WO3 catalyst and realized highly efficient visible-light driven methane conversion for the first time. The conversion efficiency was enhanced by 4.6 and 14.7 times compared to room-temperature photocatalysis and thermal catalysis at 150 degrees C, respectively. Furthermore, the production of liquid oxygenates (mainly CH3OH) was found to proceed via photocatalysis with high apparent quantum efficiencies of 5.9%, 4.5%, and 1.9% at 350, 420, and 450 nm, respectively, while CO2 evolution was contributed by photoassisted thermal catalysis. Solid isotope evidence further confirmed that CH3OH, HCHO, and CO2 were produced via parallel rather than sequential reactions. These observations provide a valuable guide for designing a visiblelight driven system for methane conversion with high efficiency and controllable selectivity.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1948-7185			WOS:000685690500011	34339207

In this study, for the first time, we investigate the pseudocapacitive storage mechanism of both ClO4- and Na ions in carbon cathode/anode with a novel NH3 plasma strategy at room temperature. Interestingly, the implementation of pseudocapacitance greatly enhances the capacity in cathodes and the kinetics in anodes, effectively reducing the mismatch between two electrodes. With the ingenious NH3 plasma strategy, which breaks the barriers of conventional methods of synthesizing N-functional carbon materials, various types and substances of N/O pseudocapacitive sites can be controlled directionally and accurately. The time-sensitive NH3 plasma treatment utilized in this work has been demonstrated to be a state-of-art method for producing high content of pyridinic-N/C=O bond and introducing ultrafast pseudocapacitance on the surface of the samples. Impressively, in-situ/ex-situ characterizations demonstrate the highly reversible evolution of Pyridinic-N and C=O during the charging/discharging processes in cathodes/anodes, which is well consistent with electrochemical results and DFT calculations, presenting the "adsorption-pseudocapacitive reactions" and "adsorption-pseudocapacitive reactions-intercalation" mechanisms for cathodes and anodes respectively. Furthermore, the SICs deliver an energy density of 107 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 200 W kg(-1). The current results are expected to be a powerful tool and an exciting opportunity to accelerate the practical application of SICs and achieve high-performance cathodes and anode materials.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000664199200001

J	Nomura, M; Kidena, K; Hiro, M; Murata, S								Mechanistic study on the plastic phenomena of coal								ENERGY & FUELS				14	4			904	909		10.1021/ef990257m				JUL-AUG 2000	2000	Highly coking coal, Goonyella coal, and slightly coking coal, Witbank coal, were submitted to ruthenium ion catalyzed oxidation (RICO) reaction to clarify the structural features of the two coals. Expected structural differences between the two coking coals were meager but interesting: Witbank coal has a little bit larger amount of longer methylene bridges (C15-C25) and longer alkyl chains (C15-C30) than Goonyella coal. Combined use of C-13 NMR and H-1 NMR spectra gave valuable information of the average aromatic ring size: Goonyella coal has larger aromatic rings than Witbank coal on average. To obtain the information about the evolution of volatile materials during heating which are supposed to be significant for the appearance of coal plasticity, two steps of heat treatment of the coals were performed: the first step is heating to the softening temperature, and the second step is heating the resulting sample to resolidification temperature. Witbank coal gave a relatively larger amount of tar in the first step of the heating than in the case of Goonyella coal, while Goonyella coal gave a larger amount of tar in the second step of the heating compared with the corresponding fraction of Witbank coal. These strongly suggest that a larger amount of metaplast, which is indispensable for the appearance of fluidity, could be produced during the plastic range (the temperature range from the softening temperature to the resolidification temperature) in the case of Goonyella coal, this leading to its higher Gieseler maximum fluidity. We previously reported that these two coking coals have almost the same amount of transferable hydrogen. Therefore, Witbank coal is supposed to consume relatively large amounts of transferable hydrogen for the formation of tar during the heating to softening temperature, probably via oxygen functional group related reactions and carbon-carbon bond breaking reactions. Due to a lower amount of transferable hydrogen in the char, subsequent bond cleavage reactions at the plastic range lead to recombination to show a very low value of its Gieseler maximum fluidity, although the three-dimensional structure framework of Witbank coal collapses to a small extent.									31	2	0	0	0	0	32			0887-0624			WOS:000088348400022

A molecular dynamics simulation investigation								FUEL				186				561	570		10.1016/j.fuel.2016.08.107				DEC 15 2016	2016	An in-depth understanding about the transformation of molten coke ash is significant to uncover the mechanism of coke reaction at high temperature inside a blast furnace. The evolution of local structural order and fluidity of molten coke ash (SiO2-Al2O3-CaO) with the reduction of SiO2 at a fixed Al2O3/CaO ratio was investigated by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. While [SA] tetrahedral was the main structural units forming Si-O network, due to the high levels of Al2O3 in coke minerals [AlO4] and a small amount of [AlO3] were the two key structural units forming the Al-O network. The effect of chemical composition on the bond length of Si-O, Al-O and Ca-O is very weak, while the coordination number of Al-O can be slightly influenced by the reduction of SiO2 due to the unstable structure of Al-centered polyhedron compared with [Sat]. The concentration of bridging oxygen decreases, while that of tricluster oxygen increases with the reduction of SiO2 from the system. Al-centered polyhedrons prefer to be connected by O triclusters, while Si-centered polyhedron favor a link by bridging oxygen. With the decrease of SiO2, more [AlO4] will change from edge-sharing to corner-sharing with similar units. The angular distribution of Si-O-Si exhibits an asymmetric shape with the average value around 151, while two peaks were observed in the Al-O-Al angular distribution because of the edge-sharing (similar to 90 degrees) and corner-sharing (similar to 122 degrees) features in Al-centered polyhedrons. With the reduction of SiO2 from the system, the diffusivity of all atoms increase considerably since the amount of strong Si-O bond decreases. Viscosity estimated from MD simulation decrease with the reduction of SiO2. The good agreement between MD simulated data and experimental data indicates that MD simulation can be adopted to estimate the property change of molten coke ash at high temperature.

Biochemically, all known Lase are oxygenases that utilize molecular oxygen to oxidize a substrate (a luciferin; literally the 'light-bearing' molecule), with formation of a product molecule in an electronically excited state. The color of the light may differ, even though the same luciferin/Lase system underlies the reaction. Filters or differences in Lase structure are responsible in some cases; in others a secondary emitter associated with a second protein is involved. In the coelenterates a green fluorescent protein, whose chromophore is derived from the primary amino-acid sequence, results in a red shift of the emission. In the bacteria accessory proteins causing either blue- or red-shifts have been isolated from different species; the chromophores are noncovalently bound. Although radiationless energy transfer has been implicated in the excitation of such accessory emitters, this may not be so in all cases.

The construction of high-efficiency and durable electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in a wide pH range and seawater is critical to overcoming the sluggish kinetic process. Herein, we develop an efficient catalytic material composed of a single-atom Ru-N-4 site and Ru nanoparticles anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon (Ru-1+(NPs)/N-C) through the coordination-pyrolysis strategy of the melamine formaldehyde resin. The Ru, catalyst shows outstanding HER activity with the smallest overpotentials, the lowest Tafel slopes, the highest mass activity and turnover frequency, as well as excellent stability in both acidic and alkaline media. Moreover, Ru-1+(NPs)/N-C shows comparable hydrogen production performance and a higher faradic efficiency to 20% Pt/C in natural seawater and artificial simulated seawater. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the strong synergistic effects between the Ru-N-4 site and Ru nanoparticles modify the electronic structure to accelerate the HER kinetics. Ru nanoparticles can effectively realize dissociation of H2O to generate adsorbed hydrogen and also promote the single-atom Ru-N-4 site to combine adsorbed hydrogen to H-2 and desorption. This work provides a new perspective for designing high-efficiency hydrogen production electrocatalysts for large-scale seawater electrolysis.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000800295400037	35333511

Devolatilization is described by a generic boundary condition at the particle surface that accounts for both convective and diffusive phenomena during pyrolysis. The heating rate history of the particle is obtained by solving for intra-particle heat transfer and heat exchange between the particle and its surroundings. The time evolution of volatile release is captured by using the particle mean temperature to calculate the devolatilization rate from a single kinetic rate law with CPD-fitted parameters. The assumed volatile composition includes both light gases and larger hydrocarbons to represent tars. A skeletal kinetic mechanism for pyrolysis and oxidation of hydrocarbon and oxygenated fuels containing 52 species and 452 reactions is used to accurately describe homogeneous chemistry. Particle heat-up, pyrolysis, ignition and envelope flame stabilization are characterized in four gas atmospheres differing in oxygen content and the use of either N-2 or CO2 as balance gas. In agreement with the experimental evidence, enhanced oxygen levels shorten ignition delay time tau(ign) and result in a higher intensity of the combustion process according to temperature and radical production peaks for all studied mixtures. For the studied oxy-mixtures the presence of CO2 in substitution of N2 delays ignition. The observed behavior is coherent with the different thermo-physical properties of the gas mixtures. The sensitivity of predicted ignition delay to a set of uncertainties is also discussed. It is found that while the absolute values of predicted ignition delay time are functions of potential particle preheating, particle Reynolds number and the chosen criterion to extract ignition delay, the relative trends among the gas mixtures remain in line with the experimental evidence.

Conversely, hydrogen peroxide acts as a second messenger in signal-transduction pathways. H2O2 is degraded by peroxidases and catalases, the latter being able both to reduce H2O2 to water and to oxidize it to molecular oxygen. Nature has evolved three protein families that are able to catalyze this dismutation at reasonable rates. Two of the protein families are heme enzymes: typical catalases and catalase-peroxidases. Typical catalases comprise the most abundant group found in Eubacteria, Archaeabacteria, Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia, whereas catalase-peroxidases are not found in plants and animals and exhibit both catalatic and peroxidatic activities. The third group is a minor bacterial protein family with a dimanganese active site called manganese catalases. Although catalyzing the same reaction (2 H2O2 -> 2 H2O + O-2), the three groups differ significantly in their overall and active-site architecture and the mechanism of reaction. Here, we present an overview of the distribution, phylogeny, structure, and function of these enzymes. Additionally, we report about their physiologic role, response to oxidative stress, and about diseases related to catalase deficiency in humans.									289	36	2	0	239	3	326			1523-0864	1557-7716		WOS:000257468000005	18498226	
J	Eng, J; Bent, BE; Fruhberger, B; Chen, JGG								Modifying surface reactivities by a carbide overlayer: A vibrational study of the reaction mechanisms of cyclohexene and 1,3-cyclohexadiene on Mo(110) and (4x4)-C/Mo(110) surfaces								LANGMUIR				14	6			1301	1311		10.1021/la970709s				MAR 17 1998	1998	The dehydrogenation and thermal decomposition mechanisms of cyclohexene and 1,3-cyclohexadiene on clean Mo(110) and carbide-modified (4 x 4)-C/Mo(110) surfaces have been studied using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). On the clean Mo(110) surface, partial dehydrogenation of a fraction of the cyclohexene molecules occurs at temperatures as low as 80 K. When the surface is heated to 150 K, the HREEL spectra obtained are characteristic of a C6H9 intermediate, as seen by a comparison with HREEL spectra reported for C6H9 On Pt(111).(1,2) At higher temperatures, competing C-C and C-H bond cleavage reactions lead to the formation of surface carbon and the evolution of hydrogen. In contrast, on the carbide-modified surface, the primary reaction pathway for cyclohexene is selective dehydrogenation to form benzene and hydrogen. In the case of 1,3-cyclohexadiene, the HREEL results suggest that dehydrogenation to form benzene occurs at 80 K on the clean Mo(110) surface, based on a comparison with the HREEL spectrum for benzene directly dosed onto Mo(110) at 80 K. However, upon heating, most of the benzene decomposes to form surface carbon and hydrogen, as shown by TPD studies. On the carbide-modified surface, the primary reaction pathway for 1,3-cyclohexadiene is selective dehydrogenation to form benzene, which desorbs at 313 K. Furthermore, the HREEL results also indicate that a competing reaction pathway occurs to form a surface intermediate which most likely has an tilted aromatic c-C-6 ring, such as a surface phenyl species.

Commercial carbon blacks were functionalized with nitrogen and Fe and/or Mn ions using pyrolysis and acid leaching. The resulting solid powder catalysts were found to be active and highly CO selective electrocatalysts in the electroreduction of CO2 to CO/H-2 mixtures outperforming a low-area polycrystalline gold benchmark. Unspecific with respect to the nature of the metal, CO production is believed to occur on nitrogen functionalities in competition with hydrogen evolution. Evidence is provided that sufficiently strong interaction between CO and the metal enables the protonation of CO and the formation of hydrocarbons. Our results highlight a promising new class of low-cost, abundant electrocatalysts for synthetic fuel production from CO2.									400	25	0	0	22	0	410			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000360628500006	26227677

In natural photosynthesis, chlorophyll pigments start the multi-electron transfer processes resulting in water-oxidation and NADP(+)-reduction. The photochemical properties of compound 1 were characterised by measuring absorption and fluorescence spectra. Electrochemical measurements in water revealed well-suited redox potentials of 1 for both proton-reduction to H-2 as well as water-oxidation to O-2. The tin(IV) porphyrin was then used as a photosensitiser in model systems for light-induced proton-reduction in aqueous solution, where an optimization of the experimental conditions was carried out to achieve reaction rates comparable to those found for [Ru(bipy)(3)](2+), a standard dye in artificial photosynthesis. By employing UV/ Vis-spectroelectrochemistry, we found that the porphyrin ligand of 1 is redox non-innocent in water. A complex set of reduction reactions of the porphyrin macrocycle occurs during photocatalytic experiments involving the ligand's chlorin form as a key intermediate. On the basis of these results, a potential reaction sequence for light-driven H-2-formation is formulated, where the reductive quenching of 1 forms the initial reaction step and reduced forms of 1 serve as hydride transfer agents to the H2 evolution catalyst. The spectroscopic, electrochemical and catalytic properties of SnTPPC make this compound class an attractive, affordable and easily accessible choice for photosensitisers in artificial photosynthetic systems. Finally, the detected complicated redox reactions of the porphyrin ring in water offer a possible explanation of why the chlorophylls of P680 or P700 are carefully wrapped in a water-free part of the PSII and PSI proteins.									58	0	0	0	5	0	58			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000337122000023	24556846

We investigated the diversity, abundance, and transcriptional levels of the gene encoding the large subunit form II of the RuBisCO enzyme (cbbM) in the pelagic microbial community at a continental-shelf site off central Chile over 2 years. We focused on cbbM genes affiliated with the sulfur-oxidizing gamma-proteobacteria cluster, whose members are known to dominate in oxygen-deficient marine environments and are highly abundant in the study area. Phylogenetic analysis of cbbM sequences suggests the presence of a novel group of chemolithoautotrophs, closely related to the SUP05/ARCTIC96BD-19 Glade. Through (RT)-qPCR, we studied the cbbM gene abundance and transcript dynamics over an annual cycle, finding a significantly higher number of cbbM copies per unit volume in months of active upwelling and at depths in which oxygen was scarce or absent. The same temporal pattern was observed at the transcriptional level. We also analyzed the relative expression of key genes for carbon, nitrogen and sulfur cycling in six metatranscriptomic datasets, for two characteristic periods within the annual cycle: the anoxic upwelling and the suboxic downwelling. Our results indicate that coastal waters of the subtropical ESP contain transcriptionally active populations of carbon fixing pelagic bacteria, whose dynamics is controlled, in large part, by fluctuations in oxygen levels. They also suggest that chemolithoautotrophic processes coupled to the sulfur and nitrogen cycles become increasingly important for the carbon economy of marine coastal waters as oxygen concentrations decline.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4				2296-7745		WOS:000457690600213		
J	CUI, CQ; TSEUNG, ACC								REACTIVE DEPOSITION OF ULTRAFINE COBALT POWDERS .1. ELECTROCHEMICAL INVESTIGATION								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE				28	2			461	468		10.1007/BF00357824				JAN 15 1993	1993	During the reactive deposition of cobalt powders, Co(OH)2 colloidal layers are formed at the electrode surface; the individual cobalt crystals are isolated by the Co(OH)2 colloid around the grain boundaries so that their growth is inhibited and ultrafine cobalt crystal grains are formed, which are loosely attached to the titanium substrate. The existence of Co(OH)2 colloid layer at the electrode surface depresses the hydrogen evolution reaction in the deposition process and accelerates the decrease of the interfacial Co2+ concentration. Therefore, compared to the normal deposition of cobalt powders, it has several unique advantages: (1 ) ultrafine cobalt powders (0.4-0.6 mum) can be produced; (2) the amount of Co(OH)2 in the powders is decreased; (3) there is a wider range of current density for the formation of cobalt powders.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0022-2461			WOS:A1993KM82300026

A step-scheme CdS/MnOx-BiVO4 photocatalyst was synthesized by spatial deposition of MnOx and one-dimensional (1D) CdS nanowires on a three-dimensional (3D) decahedron BiVO4 surface. The photocatalytic activity of CdS/MnOx-BiVO4 for the overall water-splitting reaction was investigated without sacrificial reagent under visible light irradiation. The synthesized photocatalysts were thoroughly analyzed using high-end characterization techniques. The 5CdS/MnOx-BiVO4 exhibited the highest H-2 and O-2 production rates of 1.01 and 0.51 mmol g(-1) h(-1), respectively, with an apparent quantum yield of 11.3% in the absence of any sacrificial reagent. The excellent photoactivity is due to the presence of oxygen vacancies along with effective charge separation/transfer properties and strong interaction of cocatalysts (MnOx and Pt) with the photocatalysts (BiVO4 and CdS) in the 5CdS/MnOx-BiVO4 heterojunction. The significance of the presence of MnOx and Pt cocatalysts on the selective facets of BiVO4 for efficient overall water splitting reaction is highlighted in this work.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000703995900034	34521201

Electrolytic pre-pickling is shown to be a key process towards facilitating the pickling process for material annealed both in the production-line and in laboratory experiments. The mechanism for the neutral electrolytic process on duplex 2205 and austenitic 316 steels has been examined and the oxide scale found to become thinner as a function of electrolytic pickling time. Spallation or peeling of the oxide induced by gas evolution did not play a decisive role. A maximum of about 20% of the current supplied to the oxidised steel surface goes to dissolution reactions whereas about 80% of the current was consumed in oxygen gas production. This makes the current utilisation very poor, particularly against the background of reports that in indirect electrolytic pickling only about 30% of the total current, supplied to the process, actually goes into the strip. A parametric study was therefore carried out to determine whether adjustment of process variables could improve the current utilisation.									21	1	0	0	0	0	22			0947-5117	1521-4176		WOS:000231329800001

But, until recently, techniques able to monitor simultaneously and distinguish between RO2 species ("speciated" detection) have been scarce, which has limited the understanding of complex systems containing these radicals. Mass spectrometry using proton transfer ionization has been shown previously to detect individual gas-phase RO2 separately. In this work, we illustrate its ability to speciate and monitor several RO2 simultaneously by investigating reactions involving CH3O2, CH3C(O)O-2, c-C6H11O2, and (CH3)(3)CO2. The detection sensitivity of each of these radicals was estimated by titration with NO to between 50 and 1000 Hz/ppb, with a factor from 3 to 5 of uncertainties, mostly due to the uncertainties in knowing the amounts of added NO. With this, the RO2 concentration in the reactor was estimated between 1 X 10(10) and 1 X 10(12) molecules cm(-3). When adding a second radical species to the reactor, the kinetics of the cross-reaction could be studied directly from the decay of the first radical. The time-evolution of two and sometimes three different RO2 was followed simultaneously, as the CH3O2 produced in further reaction steps was also detected in some systems. The rate coefficients obtained are (in molecule(-1) cm(3) s(-1)): KCH3O2+CH3C(O)O2 = 1.2 X 10(-11), KCH3O2+t-butylO2 = 3.0 X 10(-15), Kc-hexylO2+CH3O2 = 1.2 X 10(-13), Kt-butylO2+CH3C(O)O2 = 3.7 X 10(-14), and Kc-hexylO2+t-butylO2 =1.5 X 10(-15). In spite of their good comparison with the literature and good reproducibility, large uncertainties (x5/5) are recommended on these results because of those in the detection sensitivities. This work is a first illustration of the potential applications of this technique for the investigation of organic radicals in laboratory and in more complex systems.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			1089-5639			WOS:000415141000015	29035543

We report a novel 2D CxNy, C6N3, comprising sp-N and sp2-C atoms. Density functional theory calculations indicate that electronically, thermally, and dynamically stable C6N3 is metallic even when cut into very narrow nanoribbons. C6N3 adsorbed single atoms of 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals to fabricate single-atom catalysts (SACs) for an electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Among all SACs studied, Ti-, Cr-, Zr-, and Hf-embedded C6N3 had excellent overall performance including promising stability, moderate binding strength of H and H2, and good electrical conductivity. Our results suggest a novel C6N3 with an sp-N skeleton that has great potential for HER. More investigations are needed to further understand the properties and applications of C6N3 in other fields.

For comparison, the GPS Si3N4 obtained from highly pure Si3N4 powder (B5) was examined. The oxidation reaction was followed every minute by measuring the evolved N2 and NO using a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The weight changes of the bodies before and after the oxidation were measured and their oxidized surfaces were analyzed by SEM and EDX. The oxidation behavior of GPS Si3N4 with Y2O3 and Al2O3 additives obeyed as asymptotic kinetics possibly due to the formation of protective scales. The N2 evolution rate, the parabolic rate constant of the initial oxidation stage, the amount of N2 evolved, and the weight gain increased with an increase in the amount of Al2O3. The SEM observation of the oxidized surface revealed that the proportion of a crystalline phase identified as Y2O3.2SiO2 decreased and a glassy phase increased with increasing Al2O3 content.									1	0	0		0	0	1			0514-5163			INSPEC:4456825

The ZnFe2O4-ZnO heterojunction thin-film exhibited high efficiency to get hydrogen with photoelectrochemical method under visible-light irradiation. The property with photoinduced charge-transfer of p-type ZnFe2O4 was improved significantly by Cooperating with n-type ZnO. The heterojunction at the interface between the ZnO and ZnFe2O4 efficiently reduced the recombination of photoinduced electron-hole pairs, and thus increasing the lifetime of charge carriers and enhancing the photo-current efficiency of the ZnFe2O4-ZnO heterojunctions.

Herein, a facile and practical method is developed to in-situ grow Fe-Co Prussian-blue-analog (PBA) nanocages with an open hole in each face center on Ni(OH)(2)/NF substrate to form the hierarchical cage-on-plate structure. Furthermore, the Fe-Co PBA nanocages attached to Ni(OH)(2)/NF plates are hydrogenated and nitrogenized into FeCoNi/ NF and FeCoNiN/NF electrodes, respectively. As-prepared electrodes successfully retain the 3D hierarchical micro-nano structures of Fe-Co PBA@Ni(OH)(2)/NF precursor and can be used as a bifunctional water-splitting catalyst for overall water splitting. Compared to FeCoNi/NF, FeCoNiN/NF shows more efficiency and durability in the electrolytic water splitting tests in alkaline media. For the FeCoNiN/NF electrocatalyst, ultralow over potentials for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are only 56 and 290 mV at current densities of 10 and 500 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, overpotentials for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are 267 and 374 mV at current densities of 50 and 500 mA cm(-2). The FeCoNiN/NF electrode can act both the cathode and the anode for overall water splitting, this electrolyzer only requires a cell voltage of 1.492 V to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-)2(.) This electrolyzer can stably deliver a viable high current density of 625 mA cm(-2) for 40 h to meet the condition of industrial application. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Water electrolysis driven by a renewable resource of energy, such as wind and solar, is a promising pathway to achieve this goal, which requires highly active and cost-effective electrode materials to be developed. In this comprehensive review, we introduce the utilization of hierarchical nanostructures in electrocatalytic and photoelectrochemical applications. The unique emphasis is given on the synthetic strategies of attaining these hierarchical structures as well as to demonstrate their corresponding mechanisms for performance improvement. Rather than simply discussing all the methods that can be used in nanofabrication, we focus on extracting the rules for structural design based on highly accessible and reliable methods. Examples are given to illustrate the versatility of these methods in the synthesis and manipulation of hierarchical nanostructures, which are concentrated on nonprecious transition metals or their alloys/compounds. Through this study, we aim to establish valuable guidelines and provide further insights for researchers to facilitate their design of more efficient water splitting systems in the future.									240	16	0	0	10	0	242			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000423878500012

The WO3 synthesized using free (NR) and inorganic templates (NS and NT) thru a new sonication/hydrothermal route was comprehensively characterized utilizing XRD, TEM-SAED, photoluminescence, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance, Raman, FTIR and N-2 adsorption techniques. Herein, the WO3 NT with an average diameter of 2.9 nm and energy gap of 2.3 eV shows the best HER activity with an overpotential of -500 mV to offer a current density of 8.0 mA cm(-2) that strikingly enhanced into 14 mA cm(-2); at -410 mV, under visible light illumination (lambda > 420). The electrochemical properties determined by cyclic voltammetry, EIS and Tafel plots argued that the activity of WO3 NT is accelerated due to small size, enhanced wettability (WO3 center dot H2O); so as to facilitating the reaction with the electrolyte, together with the 1D assisted electron transfer. It was also emphasized that the HER activity is mainly controlled by the high oxygen vacancies; emphasized via XPS technique, decreased resistances and crystal orientations when using WO3 NTs rather than the high surface texturing properties devoted for the WO3 NRs (S-BET = 54.3 m(2) g(-1), V-p, = 0.084 cm(3) g(-1), pore radius = 6.5 nm). This wok provides a new approach for synthesizing a free Pt WO3 NTs photo-electrocatalyst with excellent stability; towards a remarkable HER, as examined via chronopotentiometry technique for 100 h.

The amount of Mg2+ dopant was demonstrated to have profound influence on the evolution of textural and structural properties, the functionality of active phases and the catalytic behavior of the as-synthesized ternary catalysts (Cu, ZnO and Mg2+). The Cu-1Mg/ZnO catalyst with 1 wt% MgO loading was found to be helpful for enhanced Cu dispersion and an increased amount of active surface Cu-0 sites, which promoted catalytic activity in dimethyl oxalate (DMO) hydrogenation to ethylene glycol (EG) effectively. Further increasing the Mg2+ concentration results in the aggregation of surface metal Cu nano-particles (NPs), and thus causes the reduction in the number of surface active Cu-0 sites and the activity of the Cu/ZnO based catalyst. However, the high density of the surface Cu+ sites and O2- centers generated in the Cu-4Mg/ZnO catalyst with 4.0 wt% MgO loading facilitates superb hydrogenation activity. Under the optimized reaction conditions, the Cu-4Mg/ZnO catalyst shows 100% DMO conversion and an EG yield of 95% for longer than 300 h. During the DMO hydrogenation process, Cu-0 sites are assumed to afford atomic hydrogen by dissociative adsorption and spillover. The reaction rate greatly depends on the dissociative adsorption of DMO molecules by the surface Cu+ and oxygen vacancies, originating from tight contact between the Cu NP ZnO matrix and Mg2+ dopant. Additionally, the strengthened metal-support interaction (MSI) originating from the enhanced chemical interaction between the Mg2+ modified ZnO substrate and the Cu NPs leads to excellent stability.									13	4	0	0	2	0	15			2046-2069			WOS:000413893000045

Vapor-phase thermal etching of oxides is appealing for achieving highly conformal etching of high aspect ratio features. We show that tungsten hexafluoride (WF6) can be used to selectively etch amorphous TiO2 films versus other oxides including Al2O3. Chemical vapor etching (CVE) of TiO2 by WF6 was studied with quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), spectroscopic ellipsometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and thermodynamic modeling. The XPS results show evidence for a WOxFy layer that forms on of the TiO2 films during the etch process, which may act as a surfactant layer to help enable fluorination of the TiO2. Direct CVE of TiO2 by WF6 is strongly temperature dependent, where etching proceeds readily at 220 degrees C, but not at T <= 170 degrees C. This is consistent with thermodynamic modeling showing that the etching rate is determined by the volatilization of metal fluoride and WF2O2 product species. We also show that, at low temperature, BCl3 can be used as a coreagent with WF6 to achieve self-limiting atomic layer etching (ALE) of TiO2. At 170 degrees C, the rate of ALE saturates at similar to 0.6 angstrom/cycle, which is similar to 2X the rate of TiO2 ALD at the same temperature. Experimental QCM analysis shows selectivity for TiO2 ALE vs Al2O3 as predicted by thermodynamic modeling. We also demonstrate and describe how etching reactions during initial cycles can differ from those during steady-state ALE, and we draw a physical analogy between rate evolution in ALE and well-known rate evolution during nucleation in atomic layer deposition (ALD). This work expands understanding of surface reactions in CVE and ALE and the range of reactants and materials that can be active for advanced thermal ALE processing.									27	0	0	0	0	0	28			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000408519800012

We report unexpected inter-nanorod lithium-ion transport, where the reaction fronts and kinetics are maintained within the neighbouring nanorod. Notably, this is the first time-resolved visualization of lithium-ion transport within and between individual nanorods, where the impact of oxygen deficiencies is delineated. Initially, fast lithium-ion transport is observed along the long axis with small net volume change, resulting in two lithiated silver hollandite phases distinguishable by orthorhombic distortion. Subsequently, a slower reaction front is observed, with formation of polyphase lithiated silver hollandite and face-centred-cubic silver metal with substantial volume expansion. These results indicate lithium-ion transport is not confined within a single nanorod and may provide a paradigm shift for one-dimensional tunnelled materials, particularly towards achieving high-rate capability.									41	2	0	0	3	0	41			2041-1723			WOS:000401959700001	28537250

Herein, we systematically investigated the influence of the supporting two-dimensional (2D) substrate (rGO, g-C3N4, BCN, MoS2, and WS2) on the electrocatalytic performance of CoS2 nanoparticles (NPs) for overall water splitting. CoS(2)NPs decorated onto rGO, g-C3N4, BCN, MoS2, and WS2 sheets were synthesized by adopting a facile hydrothermal technique using cobalt salt and sulfur source as precursors. Compared to unsupported CoS2, the synthesized nanohybrids supported on 2D materials, namely, CoS2/rGO, CoS2/g-C3N4, CoS2/BCN, CoS2/MoS2, and CoS2/ WS2 exhibited significantly higher water oxidation and reduction and overall water splitting efficiencies in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution, with CoS2/MoS2 and CoS2/WS2 catalysts being the most effective ones. In the case of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), CoS2/WS2 performed as the best catalyst and was able to provide a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 130 mV, whereas it only required 298 mV to generate the same current density for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The bifunctional nanohybrid CoS2/WS2 catalyst achieved a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) over 96 h for the alkaline overall water splitting at a cell voltage of 1.6 V. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also performed to further describe and determine the HER catalytic performance of the studied catalysts. Comparing the absolute values of the studied catalysts' Gibbs free energy of adsorbed hydrogen intermediate, H*, (vertical bar Delta G(H)*vertical bar), revealed that both CoS2/MoS2 and CoS2/WS2 hybrid catalysts exhibited the best surface stability and the highest HER catalytic performance.									11	1	0	0	0	0	12			2574-0962			WOS:000621660800026

The development of this technology and its combination with gasification are of increasing interest for syngas impurities control. Therefore, the present study aims to numerically assess the feasibility of implementing MILD combustion to a two-stage entrained flow gasifier for reducing nitrogen-containing impurities (mainly HCN, NH3, and NO) in the produced syngas. Specifically, a conventional combustion gasifier (CCG) is modified to a MILD combustion gasifier (MCG) by replacing the original burners with a conceptually designed MILD burner. Detailed comparisons have been made between CCG and MCG in terms of combustion characteristics and evolutions of the nitrogen-containing impurities. The results show that the present conceptually designed MILD burner can achieve more uniform temperature and species distributions in comparison with the conventional burner. Different from the preferable neutralization reactions with NO in the CCG combustor, HCN and NH3 tend to be oxidized to form NO in the MCG combustor, resulting in higher NO content at the MCG combustor outlet. As a result, concentrations of HCN and NH3 in syngas at the MCG gasifier outlet can be reduced by 22% and 9% respectively compared to those at the CCG gasifier outlet. Furthermore, results from the equilibrium-reaction-network model show that the final NO emission from MCG is 14% less than that from CCG.									9	0	1	0	0	0	10			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000468734300045

However, the pursuit of photocathodic bioassays with excellent detection performance is still in the infancy. Herein, an advanced signal amplifier of platinum-based nanocatalyst with efficient oxygen reduction capability was explored to build a high-performance photocathodic immunoassay. The target model of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9, Ag) was used for describing the sensing platform. Specifically, the nontoxic Au/CuBi2O4 photocathode was first prepared by decorating Au nanoparticles on CuBi2O4 nanofilm and was used as the matrix to anchor capture CA19-9 antibody (Ab(1)). Platinum (Pt) nanoparticles were loaded on graphene (GR) nanosheet to form Pt/GR nanocomposite, which was utilized as signal amplifier conjugating with signal CA19-9 antibody (Ab(2)). When specific sandwich immunoreaction happened, the Pt/GR played the role of an efficient nanocatalyst to accelerate the reduction reaction of electron acceptor of oxygen in the electrolyte, causing evidently enhanced cathodic photocurrent signal. By incorporating this superior signal amplification strategy into the anti-interference photocathodic immunoassay, highly sensitive and specific detection of target Ag was realized. This work pioneers a new perspective for the design of advanced photocathodic bioanalysis for various targets of interest.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0956-5663	1873-4235		WOS:000574928300007	32892117

The thermophoretic sampling technique was employed to capture soot particles directly at different positions along the flame boundary. Transmission electron microscopy was applied to obtain the particle morphology evolution. Moreover, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis, Raman spectroscopy analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were performed to study the nanostructure and oxidation reactivity of soot from the quartz plate sampling. It was found that soot inception rate was reduced in CO2 atmosphere, indicating CO2 could inhibit soot formation through inception process. However, He promoted soot formation since the soot agglomerate amount was larger than those in flames with CO2 and N-2. High correlations were found between soot nanostructure and reactivity. The soot from CO2 atmosphere had shortest fringe length and largest fringe tortuosity related with highest oxidation reactivity. On the contrary, soot from He diluted flame exhibited prevalent fullerenic-like nanostructures with evident large or small shells, and also had a higher carbonization degree resulting in lower oxidation reactivity.

A novel nanocrystalline high entropy (Be,Mg,Ca,Sr,Zn,Ni)(3)O-4 oxide has been successfully synthesized through mechanochemical treatment followed by sintering and air quenching. The present research work focuses on the possibility of single-phase formation in the aforementioned high entropy oxide despite the great difference in the atomic sizes of reactant alkaline earth and 3d transition metal oxides. Structural properties of (Be,Mg,Ca,Sr,Zn,Ni)(3)O-4 high entropy oxide were explored by confirmation of its single-phase Fd-3m spinel structure by x-ray diffraction (XRD). Further, nanocrystalline nature and morphology were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Among thermal properties, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that the (Be,Mg,Ca,Sr,Zn,Ni)(3)O-4 high entropy oxide is thermally stable up to a temperature of 1200 degrees C. Whereas phase evolution in (Be,Mg,Ca,Sr,Zn,Ni)(3)O-4 high entropy oxide before and after sintering was analyzed through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Electrochemical studies of (Be,Mg,Ca,Sr,Zn,Ni)(3)O-4 high entropy oxide consists of a comparison of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of water and hydrazine hydrate oxidation. Values of activation energy for water oxidation (9.31 kJ mol(-1)) and hydrazine hydrate oxidation (13.93 kJ mol(-1)) reveal that (Be,Mg,Ca,Sr,Zn,Ni)(3)O-4 high entropy oxide is catalytically more active towards water oxidation as compared to that of hydrazine hydrate oxidation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is also performed to get insight into the kinetics of both types of reactions.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2093-8551			WOS:000624292400011

The formation, nucleation, and adsorption of LixOy (x and y = 0, 1, and 2) and (Li2O2)(n) clusters with n = 1-4 on the surface of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were investigated by periodic density functional theory calculation. The results showed that both Li2O2 and Li2O on CNT electrodes are preferentially generated by lithiation reaction rather than disproportionation reaction. The free energy profiles demonstrate that the discharge potentials of 2.54 and 1.29 V are the threshold values of spontaneous nucleation of (Li2O2)(2) and (Li2O)(2) on a CNT surface, respectively. The electronic structure indicates that Li2O2 is a p-type semiconductor, while Li2O exhibits the properties of an insulator. Interestingly, once Li2O2 molecules condense into large clusters, they will be repelled away from the CNT surface and continue to grow into large-sized Li2O2. Our results provide insights into the full understanding of the electrochemical reaction mechanism and product formation processes of lithium oxides in the cathodes of Li-O-2 batteries.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1948-7185			WOS:000526339000032	31951140

Dense specimen having the composition of 1:20 weight ratio of talc with respect to CoNiCrAlY was prepared using the Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) technique. The aim of the present article is to investigate the reactivity and microstructure evolution of the beta/gamma-CoNiCrAlY based cermet. The resulting microstructures were analysed and their compositions determined using standard analytical techniques such as SEM, TEM and X-ray diffraction. After fabrication, the bulk of the material is shown to contain a continuous oxide layer of MgAl2O4 at the periphery of metallic particles, resulting from the reaction between aluminium, which has diffused from the bulk of CoNiCrAlY grains, with magnesium and oxygen delivered during the high temperature decomposition of the talc phase. Thermodynamic calculations results are found to be consistent with the experimental observations. The oxidation behaviour at a high temperature of this cermet was also investigated. It was shown that at its external surface a continuous double layer is formed - one external film at the surface of the sample made of MgAl2O4 and the second one more internal in between the later and the cermet made of alpha-Al2O3. The oxide scale is protective with low oxidation kinetics typical of alpha alumina growth (k(p) = 1.8.10(-7)mg(2).cm(-4).s(-1) at 1050 degrees C in flowing dry air). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The Pt-free 1T/2H-MoS2/CdS/MnOx hollow core-shell nanocomposites are fabricated via a continuous hydrothermal-chemical method; therefore, the OER co-catalysts MnOx and CdS shell are deposited on the surface of SiO2 nanosphere templates continuously via hydrothermal-chemical method. Subsequently, the SiO2 templates are etched via chemical method and the 2H-MoS2/CdS hollow core-shell heterojunction and 1T-MoS2 HER co-catalyst are introduced via one-step hydrothermal method. Evaluated by photocatalytic performance, the 1T/2H-MoS2/CdS/MnOx exhibits an enhanced HER performance of about similar to 50 folds than that of single CdS hollow nanosphere, and achieves a decent overall water splitting performance of about similar to 1668.00(H-2)/824.61(O-2) mu mol/g.h, which can be mainly ascribed to the well HER/OER synergy and formation of hollow core-shell structure. Therefore, the 1T-MoS2 with quick electron transport and decent solid/liquid interface can promote the photogenerated electron diffusing, the MnOx with mixed Mn3+/Mn4+ ions can activate the hole-related species for OH- oxidation and promote H2O2 decomposition, the 2H-MoS2/CdS heterojunction can separate the charge carrier and meet the potential to achieve overall water splitting. Additionally, the 1T/2H-MoS2 with decent lattice matching can improve the charge carrier transport, the 1T-MoS2 with sufficient specific surface areas can increase active sites and the hollow core-shell structure can increase solar efficiency which is also beneficial for enhancing the overall water splitting performance and stability.

The catalytic performance is closely related to the conductivity, active sites and reaction Gibbs free energy of the catalyst. A general guideline for improving catalytic performance is to obtain porous carbon-based materials with a high surface area, plentiful defects and metal compound loading. Here, defect-rich nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (RGO) with molybdenum (Mo)-based compound loading was designed through a two-step method. The peroxide-assisted step under low-temperature carbonization with an air atmosphere promotes the formation of defects, and the hydrothermal process improves the crosslinking degree to form a porous structure at a high carbonization temperature. The obtained catalysts exhibit excellent and durable electrocatalytic performance over a broad pH range. In addition, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results clearly reveal the presence of defects. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that the RGO and Mo-based compounds have an efficient synergetic effect on the catalytic activity. This work provides clues for the development of new catalysts for water splitting to produce hydrogen.									67	0	0	0	5	0	67			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000653229500228

Developing highly active, stable and low-cost electrocatalysts plays a critical role for achieving efficient production of hydrogen by electrolysis for practical applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of Co3O4 spinel oxides by simple calcination of commercially available cobalt salts at different temperatures (400, 600 and 800 degrees C) and the disordered structure induced highly enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an alkaline medium (1.0 M KOH). Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) indicated the formation of a normal spinel Co3O4 structure at 400 (Co3O4-400) and 600 degrees C (Co3O4-600) calcination, whereas disordered Co3O4 at 800 degrees C (Co3O4-800). HR-TEM analysis revealed the formation of spherical crystalline particles in Co3O4-400 and featureless aggregated crystalline particles at higher temperatures. The d-spacing analysis using PXRD and the lattice fringe pattern showed a decrease of the spacing with increasing calcination temperature, which suggested higher strain for Co3O4-800. The electrocatalytic HER activity of Co3O4-400 and Co3O4-600 in an alkaline medium showed moderate activity. Co3O4-400 and Co3O4-600 required an overpotential of 293 and 240 mV, respectively, to achieve a geometric current density of 10 mA cm(-2). In contrast, disordered Co3O4-800 required a very low overpotential (93 mV) for producing the geometric current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Electrochemical impedance studies showed faster kinetics and charge transfer for disordered spinel Co3O4-800 and supported the enhanced HER activity. The electrocatalytic stability studies for Co3O4-800 were tested up to 48 h at 100 mA cm(-2) current density and confirmed the excellent stability. Thus, a low-cost earth abundant HER electrocatalyst was fabricated by a simple method.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000810615100001

This work presents the investigation on using a Panzhihua (China) magnetite as oxygen carrier for chemical looping reforming of methane (CLRM). The reactivity for coproduction of syngas and hydrogen was tested by an isothermal redox experiment using methane as a reducing fuel and steam as an oxidizing gas. The kinetics study was performed on both the fresh and recycled magnetite oxygen carriers. In the redox experiments, the produced hydrogen and syngas in a H-2/CO molar ratio of 2.0 can be stably obtained with high selectivity (ca. 95.1% for syngas and ca. 96.2% for H-2). The yields of hydrogen from the original and calcinated magnetite after successive cycling are 4.94 and 5.25 mmol/g, respectively. From the kinetic study via a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) method, it is found that the reduction of original magnetite to wilstite is well represented by the phase boundary controlled (contracting cylinder) mechanism, and the 1-D nuclei nucleation and growth integrated with diffusion mechanism can be successfully applied to describe the reduction of calcined magnetite. The activation energy for the reduction of original magnetite is 93.02 kJ/mol, which slightly decreases to 86.90 kJ/mol after successive cycling due to the formation of pores inside the oxygen carriers. This work gives full evidence to the feasibility of using magnetite concentrates as low-cost oxygen carrier for the CLRM system.									76	6	0	0	10	0	78			0306-2619	1872-9118		WOS:000425075600001

Applications of this theory to PCET reactions in iron bi-imidazoline complexes, oxoruthenium polypyridyl complexes, osmium-benzoquinone systems, amidinium-carboxylate salt bridges, DNA-acrylamide complexes, and rutheium polypyridyl-tyrosine systems are summarized. The mechanistic insight gained front theoretical calculations on these model systems is relevant to PCET in more complex biological processes such as photosynthesis and respiration.

At present, there is not an economical and effective method of inhibiting NO(x)emission from sintering flue gas. Therefore, controlling the conditions of fuel combustion is extremely required for the reduction in NOx. The current research investigated the effects of different combustion parameters on the formation of NO(x)for three type of coals. The formation of NO(x)decreased with increasing temperature and heating rate while it increased when oxygen content in an atmosphere increased. Anthracite coal replacement with coke up to 100 pct promoted a decrease in the formed NO(x)amount andX(NO)by 21 and 53 pct, respectively. The addition of CaO and FeO enhanced the conversion of nitrogen to NOx, especially at temperatures below 1273 K (1000 degrees C). Taking both the oxidation reaction to form NO(x)and reduction reaction of NO(x)to form N(2)into account, the activation energy (E-A) values of anthracite and coke were evaluated to be 2.2 and 3.6 kJ/mol, respectively. The combustion of semi-anthracite coal emitted the largest amount of NOx, but the anthracite coal containing less fuel-N than other coals showed the highest value ofX(NO), which indicates that nitrogen content in coal is not the major factor affecting the formation of NOx. The change in nitrogen functionality after combustion process might be the reason for the unpredicted results in theX(NO). The pyrrolic-N in anthracite coal might be considered to be the major functional form that directly affects the conversion of nitrogen to NO.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1073-5615	1543-1916		WOS:000558130100005		
J	Schilling, Julian; Frost, B. Ronald; Marks, Michael A. W.; Wenzel, Thomas; Markl, Gregor								Fe-Ti oxide-silicate (QUIlF-type) equilibria in feldspathoid-bearing systems								AMERICAN MINERALOGIST				96	1			100	110		10.2138/am.2011.3596				JAN 2011	2011	Silicate-oxide equilibria (abbreviated as QUIlF) have proven to be very powerful tools for reconstructing the temperature and oxygen fugacity evolution of magmatic systems containing magnetite and ilmenite with olivine, quartz, or pyroxenes. In this paper, we extend these QUIlF equilibria to include rocks where silica activity is controlled by equilibria between feldspars and feldspathoids.We present data on the orthomagmatic assemblage of titanomagnetite + ilmenite + feldspar + nepheline + compositionally variable olivine, which we call AUNIlF:NaAlSi(3)O(8)+4Fe(2)TiO(4) = NaAlSiO(4)+4FeTiO(3)+2Fe(2)SiO(4) Albite Ulvospinel Nepheline Ilmenite FayaliteThe AUNIlF reference curve (with unit activities for albite, nepheline, and fayalite) is stable at oxygen fugacities >= 2 log units below the QUIlF surface at temperatures of about 700 to 800 degrees C, temperatures typical of late-magmatic stages. At temperatures > similar to 800 degrees C, the AUNIlF reference assemblage would only be stable at unrealistically low f(o2) conditions more than 5 log units below FMQ (where FMQ is the fayalite-magnetite-quartz buffer), which explains the rarity or absence of orthomagmatic AUNIlF assemblages. We determine the most reduced conditions indicated by displaced AUNIlF assemblage from Mont Saint-Hilaire (Quebec, Canada) to be Delta FMQ = -1.15 at similar to 800 degrees C (olivine is Fa(67) and a(SiO2) = 0.41) and conclude that AUNIlF assemblages involving pure fayalite do not stably occur in terrestrial magmatic systems.The stability field of naturally occurring AUNIlF assemblages is a function of albite, nepheline, and olivine compositions and is controlled by the ratio of silica activity to fayalite activity (a(SiO2)/a(Fa)). At values higher than similar to 0.77 for a(SiO2)/a(Fa), olivine is Fa <similar to 70 when silica activity is buffered by the nepheline-albite equilibrium. In these situations, AUNIlF is stable at oxygen fugacities >= -1.15 (Delta FMQ). At values below a(SiO2)/a(Fa) similar to 0.77, the AUNIlF equilibrium is shifted to lower oxygen fugacities and ilmenite becomes unstable relative to ulvospinel. Analogous to the construction and application of AUNIlF, a QUIlF-type reaction curve for potassic systems (KULIlF) involving leucite and alkali feldspar is presented and applied to naturally occurring assemblages. Potassic rocks invariably crystallize forsteritic olivine in the presence of ilmenite and magnetite, reflecting higher oxygen fugacities during crystallization than their sodic counterparts. As a result of low fayalite component in olivine, the as a(SiO2)/a(Fa) ratio becomes >= 4 in assemblages of potassic systems consisting of alkali feldspar, magnetite, leucite, ilmenite, and olivine.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0003-004X			WOS:000285988400013

Partial substitution of Se with O atoms can improve its catalytic efficiency. This work discovered that the surface activity of the substitutional O-doped single-layer GaSe surfaces (GaSe1-xOx, for x <= 22%) and their bandgap sizes are dependent on the detailed atomic configuration of the dopants, as revealed from density functional theory. For GaSe1-xOx at low O contents, where all O atoms are favorably separated by at least one-GaSe-Ga- unit, the surface activity for the HER is insignificantly improved by increasing dopant concentration. By contrast, when more O dopants are available and arranged in adjacent positions (O-Ga-O), the hydrogen adsorption efficiency of GaSe1-xOx increases and their bandgaps are reduced with increasing dopant concentration. These important features are attributed to weakening of the Ga-O covalent interaction in these more localized dopant arrangements, which in turn strengthens the O-H bonds. This weakened Ga-O covalent bond also descends the conduction band minimum toward the Fermi level, resulting in bandgap reduction and thus favoring visible-light absorption. Optimal atomic configurations (all having localized O-dopant arrangements) have been identified, and they exhibit almost thermoneutral hydrogen adsorption free energy Delta G(H) and small bandgaps (2.09-2.21 eV), making them promising materials to perform an efficient HER. Fine-tuning the Ga-O interaction by applying tensile strength T-s parallel to the 2D surface of up to 1% further reduces their bandgaps to 1.95-2.05 eV. Our theoretical predictions suggest that controlling the atomic configuration of dopants provides opportunities for engineering single-layered GaSe1-xOx materials with surface reactivity and bandgaps that suit photocatalytic water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000821168800001		
J	Lund, Tina; Kneller, James P.					Kneller, James/0000-0002-3502-3830			Combining collective, MSW, and turbulence effects in supernova neutrino flavor evolution								PHYSICAL REVIEW D				88	2					023008	10.1103/PhysRevD.88.023008				JUL 16 2013	2013	In order to decode the neutrino burst signal from a Galactic core-collapse supernova (ccSN) and reveal the complicated inner workings of the explosion we need a thorough understanding of the neutrino flavor evolution from the proto-neutron star outwards. The flavor content of the signal evolves due to both neutrino collective effects and matter effects which can lead to a highly interesting interplay and distinctive spectral features. In this paper we investigate the supernova neutrino flavor evolution in three different progenitors and include collective flavor effects, the evolution of the Mikheyev, Smirnov & Wolfenstein (MSW) conversion due to the shock wave passage through the star, and the impact of turbulence. We consider both normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchies and a value of theta(13) close to the current experimental measurements. In the Oxygen-Neon-Magnesium (ONeMg) supernova we find that the impact of turbulence is both brief and slight during a window of 1-2 seconds post bounce. This is because the shock races through the star extremely quickly and the turbulence amplitude is expected to be small, less than 10%, since these stars do not require multidimensional physics to explode. Thus the spectral features of collective and shock effects in the neutrino signals from Oxygen-Neon-Magnesium supernovae may be almost turbulence free making them the easiest to interpret. For the more massive progenitors we again find that small amplitude turbulence, up to 10%, leads to a minimal modification of the signal, and the emerging neutrino spectra retain both collective and MSW features. However, when larger amounts of turbulence is added, 30% and 50%, which is justified by the requirement of multidimensional physics in order to make these stars explode, the features of collective and shock wave effects in the high (H) density resonance channel are almost completely obscured at late times. Yet at the same time we find the other mixing channels-the low (L) density resonance channel and the nonresonant channels-begin to develop turbulence signatures. Large amplitude turbulent motions in the outer layers of more massive, iron core-collapse supernovae may obscure the most obvious fingerprints of collective and shock wave effects in the neutrino signal but cannot remove them completely, and additionally bring about new features in the signal.									29	3	0	0	0	0	29			1550-7998	1550-2368		WOS:000321860200001

In this work, amorphous molybdenum phosphide (MoP) nanocrystals were synthesizedviathe colloidal synthesis by heating MoCl5(Mo source), 1-octadecene (solvent and reducing agent) and trioctylphosphine (P source) at 340 degrees C for 6 h. Subsequently, the amorphous nanocrystals were converted into crystalline nanocrystals through annealing. Broad XRD peaks in conjunction with diffuse rings in the SAED pattern confirmed the amorphous nature of the as-synthesized nanocrystals. Alternatively, sharp XRD peaks and spotty diffraction rings in the SAED pattern confirmed the crystalline nature of the annealed nanocrystals. The amorphous nanocrystals were small, highly dispersed and had a semi-spherical morphology. The annealed nanocrystals retained their dispersity and semi-spherical morphology but increased significantly in size due to Ostwald ripening. XPS and EDS analysis demonstrated that the amorphous and crystalline nanocrystals had a composition corresponding to that of MoP. Both catalysts exhibited electrocatalytic activity and stability which compare favourably to other non-noble metal HER catalysts. Benefiting from a high density of unsaturated active sites and low charge transfer resistance (R-ct), the amorphous MoP exhibited superior activity compared to the crystalline MoP nanocrystals. To achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), amorphous and crystalline MoP required an overpotential of 235 and 317 mV in acidic media, respectively. The negligible decrease in the catalytic activity of the MoP nanocrystals for up to 1000 cycles indicated their potential as catalysts in hydrogen generation. These findings demonstrate that colloidal synthesis can be used to prepare amorphous MoP nanocrystals with well-defined morphology which exhibit electrocatalytic activity that is superior to that of its crystalline counterpart.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000562010300014

Photo-electro-oxidation of formic acid is dominated by formation of CO2, whereas incomplete oxidation of formaldehyde and methanol prevails, with the selectivity for CO2 formation increasing with increasing potential and light intensity. The mechanistic implications for the photo-electro-oxidation of the organic molecules and its competition with water oxidation, which could be derived from this novel approach, are discussed.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000364525800018	26382643

A control strategy based on the dissolved oxygen concentration, measured on line, is utilized. To detect the end of the reaction period, the automated system search for the moment when the dissolved oxygen has passed by a minimum, as a consequence of the metabolic activity of the microorganisms and right after to a maximum due to the saturation of the water (similar to the self-cycling fermentation, SCF, strategy). The dissolved oxygen signal was sent to a personal computer via data acquisition and control using MATLAB and the SIMULINK package. The system operating under the automated strategy presented a stable operation when the acclimated microorganisms (to an initial concentration of 350 mg 4CP/L), were exposed to a punctual concentration peaks of 600 mg 4CP/L. The 4CP concentrations peaks superior or equals to 1,050 mg/L only disturbed the system from a short to a medium term (one month). The 1,400 mg/L peak caused a shutdown in the metabolic, activity of the microorganisms that led to the reactor failure. The biomass acclimated with the SCF strategy can partially support the variations of the toxic influent since, at the moment in which the influent become inhibitory, there is a failure of the system.					3rd World Water Congress of the International-Water-Association3rd World Water Congress of the International-Water-Association	APR 07-12, 2002APR 07-12, 2002	Int Water AssocInt Water Assoc	MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIAMELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA	12	0	0	0	10	0	12			0273-1223			WOS:000184016100024	12862233

This difficulty has limited our understanding regarding why the HER kinetics are more sluggish in alkaline media compared to acidic media. Herein, we utilized the surface interrogation mode of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SI-SECM) to investigate the surface adsorbed species that form during the HER in alkaline media on polycrystalline platinum, Pt(poly). To deconvolute the different adsorbed intermediates, we developed a detailed COMSOL-based kinetic model to rapidly simulate the SI-SECM titration reactions under our experimental conditions. Utilization of this rapid-kinetic model overcomes the limitation of SI-SECM not having the ability to simultaneously resolve multiple surface adsorbed intermediates. We demonstrate that these numerical simulations can separate the potential dependant formation of the underpotential deposition of hydrogen (H-(UPD)) from the overpotential deposition (H-(OPD)) of hydrogen. In addition, our simulations show that a spectator species may also exist on the surface during HER potentials. Our simulations also show that at full H-2-producing potentials, the surface of Pt(poly) is fully saturated with intermediates. Comparison between the potential-dependent adsorption of H((OPD))and Tafel analysis reveal that the Heyrovsky step is likely rate-determining in alkaline media. However, in alkaline media the Heyrovsky step transitions from first-order in H((OPD))at low H((OPD))coverage to zero-order at high H((OPD))coverage, due to surface saturation of adsorbed intermediates. Tafel analysis in acidic media shows that the Heyrovsky step is likely rate-determining, but remains first-order in H(ad)over a larger potential range. These fundamental insights reveal that a sluggish Heyrovsky step is a major contributor to the attenuated kinetics of the HER in alkaline media.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2196-0216			WOS:000581064200001

In this study, hydroxyl-grafted oxygen-linked tri-s-triazine-based polymer (HGONTP) is achieved through the polycondensation of hydrothermally pretreated dicyandiamide (DCDA). The content of C-O-C linkers and terminal OH groups in HGONTP can be regulated by the cyclization and hydrolysis degrees of DCDA through the replacement of the pendant NH2 groups with OH groups. The HGONTP photocatalyst exhibits an outstanding light absorption from UV to near-IR, possessing a narrow band gap of 2.18 eV, a hydrophilic surface, a large specific surface area of 96.1 m(2) g(-1), and reduced charge recombination. As a result, HGONTP exhibits a hydrogen evolution rate 27.7-fold higher than that for pristine g-C3N4 (6.54 vs 0.236 mmol g(-1) h(-1)). The apparent quantum yield reaches 12.6% at 420 nm and 4.1% at 500 nm. In addition, the photocatalytic conversion efficiency of CO2 to CO reaches as high as 3.3 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) without cocatalysts and sacrificial agents. The selectivity of CO2 to CO achieves 88.4%. The proposed strategy paves a new avenue to design high-performance polymeric photocatalysts used in water.									28	2	0	0	4	0	29			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000529924800040	32282182

One of the major goals is to develop versatile catalysts that inherit the high catalytic efficiency of enzymatic processes, while being effective for a broad scope of substrates. In this field, the study of aldehyde catalysts has achieved significant progress. This review summarizes the application of aldehydes as sustainable and effective catalysts in different reactions. The fields, in which the aldehydes successfully mimic enzymatic systems, include light energy absorption/transfer, intramolecularity introduction through tether formation, metal binding for activation/orientation and substrate activationviaaldimine formation. Enantioselective aldehyde catalysis has been achieved with the development of chiral aldehyde catalysts. Direct simplification of aldehyde-dependent enzymes has also been investigated for the synthesis of noncanonical chiral amino acids. Further development in aldehyde catalysis is expected, which might also promote exploration in fields related to prebiotic chemistry, early enzyme evolution,etc.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6				2046-2069		WOS:000573815400051	35515689

We propose that dramatically improved performance may be achieved by combining two independent TMDC while optimizing such descriptors as rotational angle, bond length, distance between layers, and the ratio of the bandgaps of two component materials. In this paper we apply the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) process of artificial intelligence incorporating these descriptors together with quantum mechanics (density functional theory) to predict novel structures with predicted superior performance. Our predicted best system is MoTe2/WTe2 with a rotation of 300 degrees which is predicted to have an overpotential of 0.03 V for HER and 0.17 V for OER, dramatically improved over current electrocatalysts for water splitting.									35	3	0	0	0	0	36			1948-7185			WOS:000512223400042	31927930

Boron, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur doping greatly affect the electrochemical properties of Li2S/graphene. Here, we investigate the interfacial binding energy, lithium adsorption energy, interface diffusion barrier, and electronic structure by first-principles calculations to unveil the diverse effects of different dopants during interfacial lithiation reactions. The interfacial lithium storage follows the pseudocapacitylike mechanism with intercalation character. Two different mechanisms are revealed to enhance the interfacial lithium adsorption and diffusion, which are the electron-deficiency host doping and the vacancylike structure evolutions with bond breaking. The synergistic effect between different dopants with diverse doping effects is also proposed. The results give a theoretical basis for the materials design with doped graphene as advanced materials modification for energy storage.									10	1	0	0	1	0	10			2331-7019			WOS:000424634700003

With a custom designed photoelectrochemical cell, we perform operando grazing incidence X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements on the oxynitride semiconductor SrTaOxNy during photocatalytic solar water splitting. We show that the nature of the A-site (Sr) and its evolution during operation have large impacts on the overall stability and catalytic activity of the material, leading to an enriched BO2 (Ta(OH)/TaO(OH)) like surface. However, this usually beneficial effect with respect to increased surface hydrophilicity has complications for the efficiency of the photocatalytic process, as the OH and O(OH) intermediates formed are in competition between O-2 generation and NOx species formation in the initial stages of operation. Operando characterisation of the evolution of the electronic structure of the photocatalyst proves to be an invaluable tool for the rational design and discovery of new and better performing materials.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000702432700001

The present investigation employs two additional techniques to characterize the extent of electron transport inhibition induced by the addition of substituted anthraquinones to the suspending medium of spinach chloroplasts. Results are presented for spectrophotometric assays of the rate of electron transfer to an exogenous electron acceptor, 2,6-dichloroindophenol (DCIP) and for electrochemical determinations of the rate of oxygen evolution in anthraquinone-treated chloroplasts. In general, amino-substituted anthraquinones are ineffective inhibitors, maintaining electron transfer rates to DCIP at levels ranging from 50 to 90% of normal rates and yielding rates of O2 evolution averaging at 70% of the rate in untreated chloroplasts. In contrast, hydroxy-substituted anthraquinones efficiently block Photosystem II electron transport, resulting in low rates of DCIP photoreduction ranging from 0 to 20% of normal values and reducing O2 evolution rates to an average of 30% of the rate observed for untreated chloroplasts. Relative rates of DCIP photoreduction for anthraquinone-treated chloroplasts show a strong linear correlation with the reported relative F(max) chlorophyll fluorescence intensities. Relative O2 evolution rates are observed to correlate with the Stem-Volmer fluorescence quenching parameter K(sv). We suggest that slight differences in the extent of inhibitory activity of an anthraquinone as measured by the three techniques are consistent with certain known Photosystem II heterogeneities. The similarities in relative rankings of inhibitory effects for the 9,10-anthraquinones, however, demonstrate that the three techniques employed (measurements of F(max) chlorophyll fluorescence, DCIP photoreduction rates, and O2 evolution rates) are alternative assays of anthraquinone-induced Photosystem II electron transport inhibition.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0031-8655			WOS:A1992HB08500017	1603842

Here, the doping of Sb in TiO2 NRs along with co-integration of plasmonic gold nanoparticles and an amorphous lanthanum-cobalt double hydroxide (LaCo(OH)(x)) oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) is found to improve visible-light absorption, rapid electron-hole pair separation, fast electron transportation, and the surface photocatalytic reaction of the photoanode, resulting in the ameliorated water oxidation performance. The Sb-doped TiO2 NRs exhibit a reduced band gap, improved photoconductivity, and an excellent photocurrent density (1.03 mA.cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)). The anchoring of Au nanoparticles on Sb-TiO2 NRs significantly improves visible-light absorption and the photocurrent density because of the localized surface plasmon resonance effect. Herein, LaCo(OH)(x) is demonstrated as a photo-electrocatalyst and incorporated with a TiO2 NR-based photoanode for the first time. Integration of a suitable amount of the LaCo(OH)(x) OEC with Au/Sb-TiO2 NRs significantly improves photocarrier separation, photogenerated charge transportation, and the surface photo-electrocatalytic reaction and reduces the charge transfer resistance, delivering above 10 mA/cm(2) photocurrent density at 2.06 V vs RHE and resulting in the enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity and photostability for water oxidation. The LaCo(OH)(x)-electrodeposited Au/Sb-TiO2 NR sample exhibits a hydrogen production rate of 21.4 mu mol.cm(-2).h(-1) at the counter electrode under illumination. This work demonstrates a strategic design of a TiO2-based photoanode integrating doping with plasmonic nanostructures and cocatalysts for solar fuel production through water splitting.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11				2574-0970		WOS:000668366800053

Here, a Ni modified low-crystalline Ni-Ge containing hydroxide with Lewis acid sites was synthesized in highly reductive NaBH4 solution and exhibited 9.3 mu mol g(cat).(-1) h(-1) CO and 3.5 mu mol g(cat).(-1) h(-1) CH4 generation rates under visible light irradiation, and even achieved a 3.8 mu mol g(cat).(-1) h(-1) CO evolution under infrared light irradiation. The wide-spectrum light harvesting resulted from the light absorption from the localized surface plasmonic resonance of Ni nanoparticles. In addition, the Lewis acid can activate C=O bonds to decrease the kinetic barriers of CO2 reduction. The design concept that rationally combines the advantages of expanding the spectral response and activating CO2 may offer a new strategy for efficient solar energy utilization.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000457554300012	30566151

Herein, a tractable hydrothermal protocol coupled with subsequent nitridation is found to enable uniform growth of the Ni3N/Ni0.2Mo0.8N heterostructure microspheres assembled by the uniform nanorod arrays on the nickel foam framework (Ni3N/Ni0.2Mo0.8N/NF). The as-obtained Ni3N/Ni0.2Mo0.8N/NF catalyst exhibits multifunctional superior performance for both overall water and urea electrolysis. For HER, the low overpotentials of 55 and 65 mV can be only required to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline and neutral electrolytes, respectively. Furthermore, for UOR a ultrasmall potential of 1.328 V (vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2) occurs, which is much lower than that required for OER process. When applying the Ni3N/Ni0.2Mo0.8N/NF as anode for OER and cathode for HER, the water electrolyzer requires low cell voltages of 1.487 and 1.724 V to achieve 10 and 200 mA cm(-2), respectively. More significantly, the urea electrolyser presents ultralow cell voltages of 1.348 and 1.514 Vat 10 and 200 mA cm(-2) and remarkable longevity for over 500 h. Such impressive performances exceed most reported noble-metal-free catalysts and even vie for the benchmarking noble metal catalysts, heralding its tremendous utilitarian prospects for the cost-effective and energy-saving hydrogen generation.									41	0	0	0	5	0	41			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000618080800003

However, due to the oxide layer of the substrate surface, the electroforming layer suffers from poor adhesion strength. In order to reduce the oxide layer of the substrate surface, the effects of the ultrasonic electrochemical potential activation method to reduce the oxide layer of the substrate surface are investigated originally. The electrochemical methods including the cyclic voltammetry method and the chronopotentiometric method were processed by an electrochemical station. The oxygen content of the substrate surface was measured by the EDS method. The adhesion strength between the electroforming Ni layer and the Cu substrate was measured by the scratch test. The experimental results show that comparing with the ultrasound free one, the ultrasonic electrochemical potential activation method can improve the hydrogen evolution reaction and reduce the Cu substrate surface oxide content. The results of this paper can provide a new ultrasonic electrochemical potential activation method to activate the oxide layer of the substrate surface, as well as to improve the interfacial adhesion performance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4243	1568-5616		WOS:000606937100001

However, due to the low efficiency and selectivity of photocatalytic hydrogen production under solar energy, a major challenge persists to improve the performance of photocatalytic hydrogen production through water splitting. In recent years, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a non-metal photocatalyst, has emerged as an attractive material for photocatalytic hydrogen production. However, the fast recombination of photoexcited electron-hole pairs limits the rate of hydrogen evolution and various methods such as modification, heterojunctions with semiconductors, and metal and non-metal doping have been applied to solve this problem. In this review, we cover the rational design of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts achieved using methods such as modification, metal and non-metal doping, and heterojunctions, and we summarize recent achievements in their application as hydrogen production photocatalysts. In addition, future research and prospects of hydrogen-producing photocatalysts are also reviewed.									31	1	0	0	2	0	31				2073-4344		WOS:000498266100021

Molybdenum carbide (MoxC) is the typical material, which has similar properties of Pt and thought to be an attractive alternative to noble metals for H-2 evolution. The study of MoxC as alternative catalyst for H-2 production is almost focused on electrocatalytic field, while the application of MoxC as a co-catalyst in photocatalytic H-2 evolution has received in-depth research in recent years. Particularly, MoxC exhibits significant enhancement in the H-2 production performance of semiconductors under visible light irradiation. However, a review discussing MoxC serving as a cocatalysts in the photocatalytic H-2 evolution is still absent. Herein, the recent progress of MoxC on photocatalytic H-2 evolution is reviewed. Firstly, the preparation methods including chemical vapor deposition, temperature programming, and organic-inorganic hybridization are detailly summarized. Then, the fundamental structure, electronic properties, and specific conductance of MoxC are illustrated to illuminate the advantages of MoxC as a co-catalyst for H-2 evolution. Furthermore, the different heterojunctions formed between MoxC and other semiconductors for enhancing the photocatalytic performance are emphasized. Finally, perspectives regarding the current challenges and the future research directions on the improvement of catalytic performance of MoxC-based photocatalysts are also presented.

From short-term bioassays with daphnids, fish eggs, bacteria, and algae it appears that this compound has specific phytotoxic properties at concentrations below 100 mu g/L, which cannot be explained assuming an unspecific narcosis type of action in plants. Also, hydroxy-, nitro-, and methyl-derivatives show clear excess toxicity as compared to baseline toxic effects. Of several plant-specific growth and development processes investigated, only photosynthesis could be demonstrated to be affected at short exposure times and low concentrations. Disturbance of primary photosynthetic reactions such as oxygen evolution and fluorescence quenching, however, becomes only apparent after 2-3 h of exposure, which is in sharp contrast to known specific inhibitors targeting processes such as electron transport or ATP production. This, and concentration-time-effect modeling lead to the suggestion that N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine acts intracellular as a reactive compound in cell membranes producing irreversible, and thus cumulative, damage over time in algae. The effects may become first apparent in membrane-rich compartments such as the algal chloroplast.									25	5	3	0	26	0	34			0013-936X			WOS:000240826000058	17051816

SYMBIOSIS				37	1-3			137	153						2004	2004	Coral reefs are dominated by symbioses between marine invertebrates (e.g. corals, clams, sea anemones, sponges) and the dinoflagellate Symbiodinium. Increases in seawater temperature linked to global warming have lead to the phenomenon known as "bleaching", involving the disassociation of these symbioses and mass mortalities of the invertebrate host. Mass bleaching events have been linked to a thermal lesion in the photosynthesis of Symbiodinium, either at photosystem II or in the dark reactions of photosynthesis. Examination of two of the proposed lesion points, the carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM) and form II Rubisco, indicate that, over the temperature range examined, the CCM is not disrupted in Symbiodinium isolated from giant clams, however it was not possible to determine if Rubisco is the point of thermal lesion resulting in bleaching. Maximum photosynthetic rates were measured between 28 and 31degreesC and declined as temperature was increased. Despite a low correlation between Rubisco activity, oxygen evolution and temperature, Rubisco activity declined with increasing temperature.					4th International Symbiosis Congress4th International Symbiosis Congress	AUG 16-23, 2003AUG 16-23, 2003	US Natl Sci FdnUS Natl Sci Fdn	Halifax, CANADAHalifax, CANADA	34	1	0	0	32	0	34			0334-5114	1878-7665		WOS:000223474000008

The NPG synthetic process involving electrodeposition of AuxAg(1-x) alloy and its subsequent de-alloying was performed on seeds generated by electrodeposition (Cu, Ag) and electroless (Pd, Au) approaches. The outcome of the densification process was assessed by electrochemical characterization and scanning electron microscopy. While some improvement was observed on Cu and Ag seeds, significantly higher nucleation density was obtained on Au-seeded GC surfaces where the deposit featured most typical de-alloying behavior leading to highest surface area evolution. The best overall quality of NPG film manifested by high density networks of overlapping, uniform, and very small clusters nearing structural continuity was achieved on Pd-seeded GC samples.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000322883900002

Here, a N-decorated sheet-on-rod heterostructure with hierarchical porosity, as well as homogeneously dispersed Co5.47N, Co0.7Fe0.3, and Fe/Co-Nx species on the phase interface, was developed via pyrolysis of a CMP-on-MOF bimetal hybrid, to achieve the bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity. Conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) are an emerging class of multifunctional materials combining the features of conventional conjugated polymers and porous materials, simultaneously. CMP-on-MOF was prepared via the assembly of Co-phthalocyanine-CMP (Co-CMP) on the surface of Fe-MIL-88B (Fe-MOF) through a solid-phase synthesis method. The optimized catalyst (PM-900), namely the product of hybrid pyrolysis, is obtained by finely regulating the composition of hybrid (m(CMP) to m(MOF) of 1:1) and pyrolysis temperature (900 degrees C) on the hybrid, simultaneously. The abundant Co5.47N, Co0.7Fe0.3, and atomically dispersed Fe/Co-Nx species are highly catalytically active, and the hierarchical porous structure provides easily accessible pathway for active sites, and the sheet-on-rod structure ensures a high electrical conductivity which is conducive for the catalysis. As a result, the optimum electrocatalyst, denoted as PM-900, presents a superb bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for both the oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions. Additionally, a home-made Zn-air battery (ZAB) comprising PM-900 catalyst presents prominent charge-discharge property even outperforms the mixture of Pt/C (20 wt%) and IrO2. The hybrid strategy paves a new avenue for the rational design and synthesis of advanced bifunctional catalysts with intricate and unprecedented porous superstructures for reversible energy storage and conversion applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1387-1811	1873-3093		WOS:000750578600002

In this work, we present a simple interlayer cation migration strategy utilizing the unique layered structure of CuCoO2 to controllably construct an active interface. CuCoO2-CeO2 composites with a strongly coupled heterojunction interface were initially synthesized by an incipient wetness impregnation process and subsequent calcination, during which a large amount of Cun+ takes interlayer as a channel, migrating to the interface of the composite and even partially dope into the CeO2 lattice due to charge imbalance. The composites were systematically characterized using TEM/HRTEM, ICP, XRD, XPS, Raman spectra, H-2-TPR, O-2-TPD, and in situ DRIFTS measurements. As the CeO2 content in the composites increases, the Ce3+ content and surface areas of the samples increase gradually, and the Ce3+ content reached a maximum in 70%CeO2-CuCoO2. Meanwhile, the migration of interlayered Cun+ results in the generation of many oxygen vacancies and active CuOx enriched at the interface, which promoted the activation of oxygen, adsorption of CO and redox ability of CeO2-CuCoO2 composites, thus optimizing the reaction path. Creating a strongly coupled heterojunction interface and inducing interfacial Cun+ site enrichment significantly improve the catalytic oxidation activity of CO preferential oxidation (CO-PROX) at low temperatures (i.e. CO conversion more than 95.0% at even 120 degrees C), much better than a physically mixed CeO2 and CuCoO2 sample (CO conversion about 90.0% at 220 degrees C). This work indicates that irreversible cation migration in layered oxide materials could be used for the fabrication of highly active catalysts.									7	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000649016800001

The (alpha,n), (alpha,p), and (n,alpha) reactions, leading to the production of neon isotopes in the outgoing reaction channel, are taken into account in the calculations. In the first stage of calculation, neon production from (alpha,n) and (alpha,p) reactions on O-17, O-18, and F-19 is considered, and the neutron energy spectrum from (alpha,n) reactions on the major elements is derived. This spectrum is further used for calculation of the neon isotope yield from the reactions Mg-24(n,alpha)Ne-21, Mg-25(n,alpha)Ne-22, and Na-23(n,alpha)Ne-20. The calculated production of nucleogenic neon is dominated by (alpha,n) reactions with oxygen in the Earth's mantle and crust. The present calculations give Ne-21/He-4 production ratios that are approximately half those of the previous estimates by Risen [1980] and Kyser and Risen [1982]. The present study also has shown that the nucleogenic Ne-21 production from the Mg-24(n,alpha) reaction is only about one-fifth the previous estimate. The contribution of nucleogenic Ne-21 from the Mg-24(n,alpha) reaction is insignificant compared with nucleogenic Ne-21 production from O-18(alpha,n). Our estimate of the nucleogenic Ne-21/radiogenic He-4 production ratio both in the mantle and in the crust is 4.5 x 10(-8). This production ratio is quite consistent with nucleogenic Ne-21/radiogenic He-4 ratios actually observed in crustal fluid samples ((4.6 +/- 0.8) x 10(-8)). The error in calculation of the nucleogenic neon production, resulting from a random statistical variation of the entry neutron yields and cross sections, is estimated to be less than 5%.									150	5	1	0	2	0	153			2169-9313	2169-9356		WOS:A1997WY34700026

We describe the ablation mechanism which is due to a sharp increase of the oxygen pressure resulting in the particle removal from of the target surface. The calculations of the ablation threshold and the etching-rate for YBaCuO are in good agreement with experimental results. The theoretical model allows us to explain the laser effect on superconductors and to give recommendations as to the choice of laser regimes for deposition, modification, and polishing of HTSC-films.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0953-2048			WOS:A1993KK20200010

Oxygen isotopic data can indicate changes in temperature and ocean composition whereas stratigraphic variation in carbon isotope ratios may reflect changes in the carbon cycle that can be linked to changes in oceanic productivity and atmospheric greenhouse gases. Terrestrial carbonates - meteoric cements, calcretes and speleothems - similarly offer significant potential for understanding the evolution of terrestrial climates by providing evidence for the composition of rainwater and the nature of vegetative cover.Primary environmental isotopic signals may be obscured by the effects of post-depositional diagenetic alteration. Cementation and replacement reactions can take place in a wide range of diagenetic environments; the diagenetic history of an individual limestone is determined by a combination of its mineralogical diagenetic potential and depositional setting, together with subsequent changes in relative sea-level and burial history. Carbon isotopic values are less prone to alteration during diagenesis than oxygen values but shifts can be significant where organogenic carbon is incorporated. Linear covariation of carbon and oxygen values is not a reliable indicator of diagenetic alteration: water-rock interaction and fluid mixing may produce non-linear distributions.Attempts to determine long-term changes in climatic and oceanographic conditions through isotope stratigraphy of shallow-water limestones must include an assessment of the diagenetic history of the materials analysed. Petrographic examination using conventional microscopy backed up, where appropriate, by cathodoluminescence and scanning electron microscopy together with elemental and strontium isotopic analysis can help to identify the effects of diagenetic alteration. Where material with a range of different degrees of alteration is preserved in the same sediment it may be possible to compare patterns of isotopic and elemental variation and to attempt to unravel the effects of diagenesis in order to determine primary, environmental, isotopic signals. Recent research has shown that these techniques can be successfully employed in both Phanerozoic and Precambrian sediments.									576	35	1	0	189	4	606			0016-7568			WOS:A1992HL90700002

However, the design of the working electrode, which is the key to the battery performance, is absent in the literature. In this work, the electrode design of hybrid Zn-Co3O4/air batteries for performance improvements is investigated by considering the active material loading and the surface hydrophobicity of the CO3O4 nanosheet-decorated carbon cloth electrode. The results demonstrate that the capacity of the Zn-Co3O4 battery first dramatically increases with the loading, but the improvement becomes limited when the loading further increases. The discharge voltage plateau of the Zn-air battery increases first and then keeps decreasing. The reason is that although both the active material and the surface area increase, the increased dimension of nanosheets increases the transport resistance, especially for electrons and oxygen. For a given electrode, the discharge voltage of the Zn-air battery first increases with an increase of the hydrophobicity due to the creation of gaseous oxygen transport pathway, but then decreases due to the coverage of active sites. While both the voltage and the capacity of the Zn-Co3O4 battery decrease with the hydrophobicity, which is attributed to the decreased contact surfaces between the reactant and the liquid electrolyte. Based on the optimized active material loading and surface hydrophobicity, a hybrid Co3O4/air battery delivers a high energy density of 936 Wh kg(-1) (on the weights of CO3O4 and consumed Zn) and stable discharge and charge voltages ranging from 0.94 V to 2.01 V for 400 cycles. This work illustrates that for high-performance hybrid batteries, the active material loading of the electrode should be well designed considering the transport of electrons and oxygen, and a balance between the hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity should be established.

J	Smith, L; Bolgiano, B; Davies, H C								Kinetics of the interaction of cytochrome c oxidase of Paracoccus denitrificans with Paracoccus and mitochondrial cytochrome c.								Progress in clinical and biological research				274				619	35						1988	1988	We have studied the reactions of the oxidase of Paracoccus dentrificans with its membrane-bound cytochrome c and with soluble cytochrome c550 of Paracoccus and of bovine heart. The turnover rate of Paracoccus oxidase with membrane-bound cytochrome c is high, approaching 1000/sec. at 25 degrees. When soluble cytochrome c is added to the electron transport chain oxidizing NADH or succinate, no increase in 02 uptake is observed. When the oxidase is reacting with the membrane-bound cytochrome c, the reaction site is not exposed for reaction with soluble cytochrome c. We have purified the Paracoccus oxidase, following relatively simple methodology. It has three major subunits similar in molecular weight to those of the larger subunits of the bovine oxidase. When reconstituted in the presence of asolectin, it is just as active as the intact membrane-bound oxidase in reaction with soluble cytochrome c. The soluble cytochrome c reacts directly with the cytochrome aa3. We found direct evidence that the oxidase is stimulated in the presence of low concentrations of cytochrome c. The stimulatory effect could be the explanation for the so-called "high affinity" site for reaction with cytochrome c. The reaction of bovine cytochrome c with Paracoccus oxidase resembles that with the bovine oxidase in every way tested. The Paracoccus oxidase must have a cytochrome c binding site equivalent to that of the bovine enzyme. The reaction of the Paracoccus oxidase with its own soluble cytochrome c550, which has a highly negative hemisphere on the side of the molecule away from the heme crevice, has different properties from those seen in its reaction with bovine cytochrome c. However the properties all change to be like those with bovine cytochrome c on addition of poly-L-lysine. These data emphasize the importance of all of the charged groups on the cytochrome c in influencing binding or electron transfer reactions. The respiratory chain on the membranes of a cytochrome c-deficient mutant can reduce cytochrome aa3 using NADH as substrate in a manner similar to that of the wild type, although at somewhat lower rate, suggesting diffusional encounter of the large complexes within the membrane. Our data permit speculations about the possible evolution from the bacterial to the mitochondrial electron transport system.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0361-7742			MEDLINE:2841681	2841681

Elemental analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance, nitrogen adsorption, and scanning electron microscopy have been used to analyze the physicochemical properties of the activated carbons. The results show that C-O-P linkages of phosphorus-containing groups can progressively evolve into C-P-O, C-3-P=O, C-3-P, and eventually elemental phosphorus as a result of heat treatment. Phosphate-like groups are much more thermally stable in an N-2 than in an H-2 atmosphere. In N-2, C-O-P linkages significantly evolve into C-P-O and C-3-P=0 at up to 800 degrees C, whereas C-3-P linkages are not formed even at 900 degrees C. In H-2, the corresponding evolution remarkably occurs at 500 degrees C, forming C-3-P linkages and eventually elemental phosphorus. Moreover, the two activated carbons exhibit different evolution trends, suggesting that the evolution happens more easily for phosphorus-containing groups located on the edges of graphite-like crystallites than those in the lattice. Finally, we propose different evolution pathways of phosphorus containing groups upon heat treatment in N-2 and H-2 atmospheres.									47	0	1	0	7	0	47			0743-7463			WOS:000398014700018	28271892

Biomolecules				5	3			2101	22		10.3390/biom5032101				2015 Sep 10	2015	Cellular metabolism assembles in a structurally highly conserved, but functionally dynamic system, known as the metabolic network. This network involves highly active, enzyme-catalyzed metabolic pathways that provide the building blocks for cell growth. In parallel, however, chemical reactivity of metabolites and unspecific enzyme function give rise to a number of side products that are not part of canonical metabolic pathways. It is increasingly acknowledged that these molecules are important for the evolution of metabolism, affect metabolic efficiency, and that they play a potential role in human disease-age-related disorders and cancer in particular. In this review we discuss the impact of oxidative and other cellular stressors on the formation of metabolic side products, which originate as a consequence of: (i) chemical reactivity or modification of regular metabolites; (ii) through modifications in substrate specificity of damaged enzymes; and (iii) through altered metabolic flux that protects cells in stress conditions. In particular, oxidative and heat stress conditions are causative of metabolite and enzymatic damage and thus promote the non-canonical metabolic activity of the cells through an increased repertoire of side products. On the basis of selected examples, we discuss the consequences of non-canonical metabolic reactivity on evolution, function and repair of the metabolic network.									46	2	0	0	37	0	47				2218-273X		MEDLINE:26378592	26378592

Here we confirmed the apparent 'electroautotrophic' behavior of electroactive biofilms (EABs) grown on carbon electrodes at + 0.20V vs. Ag/AgCl under air. The EABs catalyzed O-2 electroreduction into water as demonstrated by a rotating ring disc experiment and performed quasi-reversible heterogeneous electron transfer (HET). By using electrodes of low surface capacitance, we report for the first time nonturnover redox peaks that are very likely intrinsic to the redox protein (s) performing the HET. Because the formal potential of redox proteins is pH-dependent, we investigated the evolution of characteristic potentials of the EABs with the solution pH: (i) open circuit potential, (ii) half-wave potential, and (iii) averaged peak potential of nonturnover cyclic voltammograms, which is presumably the formal potential of the primary electron acceptor(s) for the community. In addition to describing the redox thermodynamics behind HET, we suggest that the corresponding data provides an electrochemical fingerprint that could help in comparing the electroactivity of diverse microbial communities. The taxon with the highest relative abundance in our EABs was an unclassified member of the Gammaproteobacteria that was phylogenetically closely related to most other abundant unclassified Gammaproteobacteria commonly reported in EABs reducing O-2 at high potentials, further suggesting that those taxa are responsible for the bioelectroactivity. Phylogenetic and electrochemical similarities between reported EABs jointly support the hypothesis that similar biomolecular mechanisms may be responsible for this highly probable electroautotrophic metabolism.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0956-5663	1873-4235		WOS:000603554600003	33096434

In this study, the favorable regulation of the electronic structure of the cobalt oxide nanoclusters was firstly predicted by density functional theory (DFT) simulation, and then experimentally verified by confining sub-nanometer CoOx clusters (0.86 nm) into the small pore of ZIF-8 derived N-doped nanomaterials (PNC) using a microporous MOFs confinement strategy. The confined effect of the MOF micropores not only enhanced the stability of the subnanometer cobalt oxide clusters, but also make it coupled with Co-Nx to further regulate the electronic structure of the former, synergistic resulting in enhanced ORR/OER actives. As a result, the optimized 0.05CoOx@PNC catalyst demonstrates outstanding bifunctional oxygen performance with a smaller potential gap of 0.67 V. Moreover, the rechargeable Zn-air batteries integrated 0.05CoOx@PNC air cathode displays encouraging performance with a peak power density of 157.1 mW cm(-2), a specific capacity of 887 mAh g(Zn)(-1)at 10 mA cm(-2) and long-term cyclability for over 200 h, significantly outperforming the benchmark electrode couple consisted of Pt/C/RuO2. DFT calculation further revealed that reducing particle size and coupling with Co-N could effectively regulate the charge distribution of CoOx nanoclusters and downshift the D-band center of Co adsorption sites in CoOx nanoclusters, which reduced the reaction barrier of intermediate O-2* and OH* and ORR/ OER overpotential, thus accelerating the overall ORR/OER kinetic process. This work offers a novel reference for the construction of a robust sub-nanometer cluster catalysts in the field of ZABs.									42	5	0	0	1	0	43			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000640477200002

However, the high voltage loss of bipolar membrane imposes significant constraints on operating current density, leading to low current density (<50 mA cm(-2)) for hydrogen production. In this work, decoupled amphoteric water electrolysis assisted with MnO2/Mn2+ redox mediator demonstrated to separate the stiff couple between hydrogen and oxygen production into two independent processes, which enables hydrogen production to run under high power input (up to 1 A cm(-2)) with oxygen production under low power input. Furthermore, such an amphoteric decoupled water electrolysis system can be integrated with an Mn-Zn battery, which is able to realize flexible conversion from renewables to hydrogen and electric energy, thus making full use of renewables.									18	0	0	0	3	0	18			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000621101100012

Fundamental insights into the interaction between single atom active sites, and its effect on the catalytic performance are still rare. Herein, we demonstrate the critical role of active site interaction in the intrinsic activity of SACs during acidic hydrogen evolution catalysis. Different amounts of platinum (Pt) atoms were atomically dispersed on graphitic carbon supports (PtSACs) to vary the spatial distance and thus the interaction between active sites. Remarkably, the PtSAC with improved active site interaction exhibited significantly enhanced intrinsic activity towards acidic hydrogen evolution (e.g., a high turnover frequency of 8.01 H-2 s(-1) at 20 mV), surpassing commercial Pt/C and other reported outstanding catalysts. Theoretical calculations further revealed that the increasing interaction between single atom active sites can largely modify their electronic configurations and result in more favored hydrogen adsorption/desorption behaviors, which is responsible for the enhanced intrinsic activity towards hydrogen evolution catalysis.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000731511300004

A Chlamydomonas mutant lacking a carbonic anhydrase associated with the PSII donor side shows impaired O-2 evolution in the absence of HCO3-. The O-2 evolution for saturating, continuous illumination (R-O2) was slower than in the wild type, but was elevated by HCO3- and increased further by Cah3. The R-O2 limitation in the absence of Cah3/HCO3- was amplified by H2O/D2O exchange, but relieved by an amphiphilic proton carrier, suggesting a role of Cah3/HCO3- in proton translocation. Chlorophyll fluorescence indicates a Cah3/HCO3- effect at the donor side of PSII. Time-resolved delayed fluorescence and O-2-release measurements suggest specific effects on proton-release steps but not on electron transfer. We propose that Cah3 promotes proton removal from the Mn complex by locally providing HCO3-, which may function as proton carrier. Without Cah3, proton removal could become rate limiting during O-2 formation and thus, limit water oxidation under high light. Our results underlie the general importance of proton release at the donor side of PSII during water oxidation.									62	0	5	0	59	0	67			0261-4189	1460-2075		WOS:000253816500007	18239688

Tyrosyl and tryptophanyl radicals react with nitric oxide (NO) with an almost diffusion-limited rate. The catalytically competent tyrosyl radical in ribonucleotide reductase (RR) and prostaglandin H synthase (PGHS) recombines with NO in a radical-radical reaction. The unstable adduct formed can dissociate to regenerate the tyrosyl radical. However, upon prolonged incubation with NO, the diiron center of mouse RR leaks out, while the adduct is sucessively oxidized into an iminoxyl radical and a nitrotyrosine in PGHS. These data provide a plausible mechanism for the physiological inactivation of RR observed in various models, and may help in understanding the inhibition of PGHS reported in some cases. Reversible combination with NO is an intrinsic property of tyrosyl radicals, which also occurs with Y-D(.) and Y-Z(.) in photosystem II, where NO has been useful in the analysis of the oxygen-evolving complex.									19	1	0	0	16	0	20			1420-682X			WOS:000081720100007	10484663

The XRD analyses confirmed the progressive evolution of the two crystalline phases. Tests as humidity sensors show that the electrical resistance of samples containing high proportions of hexaferrite phase is strongly influenced. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses under air or argon revealed an intrinsic semiconducting behavior for hematite and samples doped with 3 and 4 wt % equivalent BaO. The samples containing higher proportions of barium exhibited an extrinsic semiconducting behavior characterized by a variation of the conductivity with the oxygen partial pressure. This study allowed us to define the percolation threshold of the barium hexaferrite crystalline phase in the hematite matrix. The value was estimated to hematite doped with 5 wt % BaO, i. e., 36 wt % of barium hexaferrite phase. EIS analyses under various NO2 partial pressures confirmed the sensitivity of these materials. The linearity of the response was particularly evident for the 5, 10 and 14 wt % samples.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1996-1944			WOS:000330295600030	28788361	
J	Blackstone, Neil W								Chemiosmosis, Evolutionary Conflict, and Eukaryotic Symbiosis.								Results and problems in cell differentiation				69				237	251		10.1007/978-3-030-51849-3_9				2020	2020	Mutualistic symbiosis, in which individuals of different species cooperate and both benefit, has long been an evolutionary puzzle. Why should individuals of two different species cooperate? In this case, as in all others, cooperation is not automatic, but rather requires the mediation of evolutionary conflicts. In chemiosmosis, redox reactions produce a trans-membrane "proton-motive force" that powers energy-requiring reactions in most organisms. Chemiosmosis may also have a role in conflict mediation. Chemiosmosis rapidly produces considerable amounts of products, increasing the risk of end-product inhibition and the formation of dangerous by-products, such as reactive oxygen species. While several mechanisms can modulate chemiosmosis, potential negative effects can also be ameliorated by simply dispersing excess product into the environment. This "free lunch you are forced to make" can attract individuals of other species leading to groups, in which other organisms share the products that are released into the environment by the chemiosmotic cell or organism. Since the time of Darwin, evolutionary biology has recognized that groups are the key to the evolution of cooperation. With many small groups, chance associations of cooperators can arise, even if cooperation is selected against at the individual level. Groups of cooperators can then outcompete groups of defectors, which do not cooperate. Indeed, numerous symbioses may have arisen in this way, perhaps most notably the symbioses of host cells and chemiosmotic bacteria that gave rise to the eukaryotic cell. Other examples in which one partner relies on chemiosmotic products supplied by the other include lichens, corals or other metazoans and dinoflagellates, sap-feeding insects, and plant-rhizobia and plant-mycorrhiza interactions. More problematic are cases of gut microbiomes-for instance, those of termites, ruminants, and even human beings. Under some but not all circumstances, chemiosmosis can be co-opted into punishing defectors and enforcing cooperation, thus leading to mutualistic symbioses.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0080-1844			MEDLINE:33263875	33263875

Nanoporous copper (NPC) obtained by dealloying Cu/Al alloy is used as both reducing agent and three-dimensional substrate. Electron microscope and X-ray diffraction characterizations demonstrated that a simply galvanic-replacement reaction with H2PtCl6 aqueous solution can easily generate nanoporous core/shell structure with a thin Pt/Cu alloy shell and Cu (or Pt/Cu alloy) core. The morphology and crystal structure evolution of the nanocomposites are studied and discussed in detail. The as-prepared bimetallic PtCu nanocomposites show greatly enhanced catalytic activity and stability toward methanol electro-oxidation as compared with commercial Pt/C catalyst. This facile in situ preparation strategy is also suitable for large-scale production of this novel and inexpensive catalyst.									97	2	1	0	5	0	99			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000298341300012	22034948

The constructed CdSe/ZnSe/ZnO sandwich nanotube array photoanode displays drastically boosted photoelectrochemical ability to generate hydrogen. The hydrogen production rate of the CdSe/ZnSe/ZnO sandwich nanotube array photoanode reaches up to 54.4 mu mol h(-1), which is around 5 and 6 times that of the ZnSe/ZnO and ZnO nanotube array photoanodes, respectively. Moreover, the photoconversion efficiency of the CdSe/ZnSe/ZnO sandwich nanotube array photoanode reaches up to 1.7 % at 0.5 V versus RHE, which is 34 and 24 times that of the ZnO and ZnSe/ZnO nanotube array photoanodes, respectively. The measurements of the electrochemical properties demonstrate that the drastically enhanced PEC water splitting for hydrogen evolution of the sandwiched CdSe/ZnSe/ZnO nanotube arrays is attributed to the efficient separation of the photogenerated charge carriers.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000623250500002

Feldspar crystals grew from mixed magmas that are characterized by a high degree of homogenization. The 3D depiction of trace element distribution indicates that the crystallization process was followed by interaction with fluids. The magmatic system involved in feldspar formation shows non-linear dynamics. The interaction with fluids is also deterministic, but in contrast to magmatic crystallization, it shows an increasing persistency in element behaviour. The degree of persistency of the element activities in both processes has been calculated using the Hurst exponent. The recrystallization (regrowth) process induced by fluids proceeded along crystal fractures and cleavages, causing selective enrichment in large ion lithophile elements (light rare earth elements), Pb, Y, and in various water species. It did not change the feldspar oxygen isotope signature. In turn, the incorporation of hydrogen species into feldspar domains reduced Al-O--Al defect densities in the structure, decreasing their luminescence. Water speciation shows persistent behaviour during heating, the process being reversible at least up to 600 degrees C. Carbonate crystals with a mantle isotope signature are associated with the re-equilibrated feldspar domains. The feldspar compositions, the abundance of water species in them and the refractory nature of the residuum after heating, the unchanged oxygen isotopes and the mantle signature of co-precipitated carbonates testify that the observed recrystallization has taken place at temperatures above 600 degrees C with H2O-CO2 fertile, mantle-derived fluids. The paper draws special attention to some methodological aspects of the problem. The multi-method approach used here (major element, trace element and isotope geochemistry, infra-red, cathodoluminescence, 3D depiction of geochemical data and fractal statistics) may help to recognize and separate the various processes throughout the alteration history of the pluton.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			0022-3530	1460-2415		WOS:000299347800004

The relationship between k(app) and E-EO is also discussed. The degradation efficiency and k(app) always rising at higher j and lower C-o and C-N while EC, E-EO, and operating cost increased at higher j, C-o and C-N. On the other hand, The COD increased with decrease j, Co and higher C-N. Due to the strong formation of hydroxyl radicals from water discharge, the graphite electrode possesses a strong power of electro-generation rate and competitive wasting reactions of organic compounds. The results demonstrated that the relatively high dye removal, COD and low specific energy consumption are obtained simultaneously only if the various parameters are regulated to a plausible value j of 79 A m(-2), Co of 100 mg/L and C-N of 1 g/L within 60 min of electrolysis. The color removal efficiency is much faster for RV-2 compared to AB-14 due to the contribution of azo bond in the dye molecule. Also, the EC and k(app) are higher for RV-2 than AB-14 while is lower in terms of E-EO and COD. A comprehensive reaction sequence of RV-2 and AB-14 mineralization involving all oxidation products was proposed. Formation and evolution of aromatic and aliphatic (short-chain carboxylic acids) intermediates during the treatment and a mineralization pathway is proposed. The estimated cost of operation for degradation at optimum conditions is calculated as 1.54 and 1.29 USD m(-3)/g dye for complete degradation RV-2 and AB-14, respectively.									67	3	0	0	24	1	69			0147-6513	1090-2414		WOS:000429892700058	29121592

Herein, we report our insight on the nature and dynamics of highly active silver-manganese oxide (Ag-MnOx) catalyst surfaces for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via a combined experimental-theoretical approach. Experimentally, we synthesize well-mixed Ag-Mn co-deposited thin films that are measurably flat and smooth, despite Mn surface migration and oxidation upon air exposure and electrochemical measurements. Cyclic voltammetry in 0.1 M KOH demonstrates up to 10-fold specific activity enhancements over pure Ag at 0.8 V vs. RHE for Ag-rich films (70-95% Ag in bulk). To further understand the Ag-Mn system, separate samples were synthesized with small amounts of Mn sequentially deposited onto the surface of a pure Ag thin film (Mn@Ag), ranging from partial to full surface coverage (down to 0.3 nm(Mn) cm-2(geo) similar to 0.2 mu g(Mn) cm-2(geo)). These sequentially deposited Mn@Ag films show analogous performance to their co-deposited counterparts indicating similar enhanced active sites. With density functional theory (DFT), we calculate that this enhancement arises from the tuned d-band of these material surfaces owing to the optimal hybridization of the electronic structures in specific Ag and MnOx geometries. Together, electrochemical measurements, DFT calculations, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and valence-band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggest synergistic electronic interactions between Ag and MnOx yield enhanced oxygen adsorption, and thus ORR activity, with DFT highlighting the Ag-MnOx interface sites as the most enhanced. This work demonstrates how combined experimental-theoretical methods can help design electrocatalysts with enhanced electrocatalytic properties and understand the nature of complex mixed metal-metal oxide surfaces.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000766715400001

Free radicals are unstable molecules that can cause damage at cellular level due an imbalance between free radical production and antioxidant defenses, generating oxidative stress. This mechanism seems to contribute to several pathological conditions including degenerative processes, aging, diseases and syndromes. Understanding the origin of oxidative stress mechanisms at cellular level, and strategies to reduce it through the cell antioxidant defense system is the focus point of numerous studies. In the same way extensive research has been conducted to find a way to control free radicals production generated continuously through some cellular processes in the body such as oxidative metabolism of the mitochondria and the molecular process required to generate ATP.

In this work, plasmonic silver nanocubes (AgNCs) with (100) facet and silver nanooctahedra (AgNOs) with (111) facet were applied as the light-harvesting catalysts for enhancing hydrogen production in the plasmon-activated HER electrochemical system. As light harvesters, AgNCs and AgNOs can efficiently absorb light ranging from ultraviolet to near-infrared to generate hot electrons for facilitating electrocatalytic HER. Both AgNCs and AgNOs revealed the light-harvesting capability to improve HER activities with laser irradiation. Moreover, the current densities of AgNOs with (111) facet were higher than those of AgNCs with (100) facet for electrocatalytic HER under irradiations with three different laser wavelengths. The density functional theory (DFT) simulations revealed that the adsorption energy of the surfaces followed the order Ag(111) < Ag(100), indicating that hydrogen could be easily desorbed on the Ag(111) surface for HER. Combination of the experimental HER results and DFT simulations expressed that AgNOs with (111) facet were the excellent light harvesters in this study. Based on the DFT simulations of the H-Ag(111) and H-Ag(100) systems, the findings could be extended to other plasmon-enhanced HER electrochemical systems and could enable electrocatalysts to be designed at the atomic level.									21	1	0	0	1	0	21			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000470035000015		
J	Raven, John A.								Plant responses to high O-2 concentrations: relevance to previous high O-2 episodes								PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY				97	1-2			19	38		10.1016/0031-0182(91)90179-U				DEC 1991	1991	Exposure to the similar to 43 kPa O-2 thought to correspond to the highest O-2 partial pressure in the Phanerozoic rather than the 21 kPa in the present atmosphere deleteriously affects extant C-3 land plants by increasing (1) the O-2 inhibition (competitive with CO2) of the carboxylating enzyme ribulose 1,5 bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase, (2) the O-2 inactivation of nitrogenase in symbiotic N-2-fixers, and (3) the generation of reactive oxygen species which can damage nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and other cell constituents. Exposure of these plants to O-2 levels approximating a high O-2 episode inhibits growth via inhibition of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase and, possibly, by unrepaired damage caused by reactive oxygen species and by the resource diversion related to increasing the capacity of mechanisms reducing the level of reactive oxygen species and to repairing the damage caused by these species. Longer term effects (e. g. increased level of mutations in a population) have not been explored.Natural exposure of all or part of extant plants to O-2 levels in excess of 43 kPa occurs in the light in most plants other than C-3 land plants due to photosynthetic O-2 evolution with restricted diffusion to a medium with normal O-2 levels attendant on the maintenance of high CO2 concentrations around ribulose 1,5 bisphosphate carboxylase. While the high O-2 levels seem to be restricted where possible to non-meristematic regions of multicellular plants, these plants which have high internal O-2 levels do not seem to be disadvantaged relative to C-3 land plants.The high O-2 concentrations proposed for periods in the Phanerozoic are tolerated, as intracellular O-2 levels, in some cells of a substantial fraction of extant phototrophs, and many can tolerate substantially higher levels. Fire seems more likely than the effects discussed in this paper as limitations on co-occurrence of terrestrial vegetation and high O-2 levels.									26	1	0	0	20	0	27			0031-0182	1872-616X		WOS:000202963400003

Because complex physical, chemical, and electrical processes are involved in solar energy conversion reactions, understanding the mechanisms is of great significance for the rational design of highly efficient solar water-splitting cells. This review describes the current mechanistic understanding of the adsorption of reactants, injection of charge carriers, and desorption of products during surface redox reactions. Variations of interfacial band-gap structures, the status of surface bonding, and the behavior of charge carriers in semiconductor photoelectrodes are discussed. This review could inspire further innovative work on understanding the mechanisms of solar water splitting.									72	3	0	0	1	1	71			2451-9294			WOS:000429434000006		
J	JAHNS, P; JUNGE, W								THYLAKOIDS FROM PEA-SEEDLINGS GROWN UNDER INTERMITTENT LIGHT - BIOCHEMICAL AND FLASH-SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC PROPERTIES								BIOCHEMISTRY				31	32			7390	7397		10.1021/bi00147a025				AUG 18 1992	1992	Thylakoid membranes were isolated from pea seedlings grown under intermittent light (2-min light/118-min dark cycles). These preparations differed from controls (thylakoids from plants grown under 16-h light/8-h dark cycles) in the following respects: 15 times smaller chlorophyll/protein ratio, 10 times greater chlorophyll a/b ratio, absence of light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding proteins, and 2-3-fold greater ratio of photosystem II over photosystem I. In addition we found the following: (1) Electrogenic electron transfer around cytochrome b6/f under flashing light was greatly enhanced, probably as a consequence of the greater photosystem II/photosystem I ratio. (2) The rate of proton uptake from the medium at the acceptor side of photosystem II was enhanced, probably by unshielding of the quinone binding domain. (3) The N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide sensitivity of the proton-pumping activity of photosystem II was absent, which was consistent with the attribution of a N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-induced protonic short circuit to chlorophyll a/b binding proteins. (4) The sensitivity of oxygen evolution under continuous light to variations of pH or the concentration of Ca2+ was altered. Chlorophyll a/b binding proteins serve as light-harvesting antennas. We found in addition that they modulated the activity of water oxidation and, in particular, the protolytic reactions around photosystem II.									24	0	0	0	23	0	24			0006-2960			WOS:A1992JJ57800025	1510928

In this regard, we report a facile one-pot hydrothermal synthesis of self-assembled manganese sulfide on graphene layers (MnS/G), and is recognized as a nonprecious-metal catalyst for the efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in an alkaline medium. The phase purity and surface morphologies are investigated by using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopic techniques, respectively. Optimized MnS/G with 50% Mn exhibited excellent ORR properties with onset and half-wave potentials of 0.83 and 0.71 V vs.RHE, respectively. While evaluating the durability, only a 90 mV negative shift in its half-wave potential is observed after 5000 repeated potential cycles, which is also ascertained for up to 48 h of operation at a constant potential by using a chronoamperometric technique with 28% degradation in the current. The optimized material is utilized as a cathode catalyst in fabricating membrane electrode assembly for performance evaluation in an anion exchange membrane fuel cell. A peak power density of 12 mW cm(-2) is realized in H-2-O-2 feeds under ambient temperature and pressure; thus, it looks as an alternative non-preciousmetal catalyst for fuel cell applications.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			2196-0216			WOS:000407694400039

The as synthesized CeO2 NRs appeared highly crystallized with a cubic structure, while their lengths increased from similar to 20 to 50 nm as the concentration of the hydroxide ions increased. By tuning their surface properties, the CeO2 NR samples exhibited favorable band structures, which enabled them to effectively absorb large amount of photon energies and enhance the photocatalytic properties. The optimum CeO2 sample showed the highest H-2 production rate (similar to 25.10 mu mol/g after solarlight irradiation for 5 h), largest Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area (65.26 m(2)/g), smallest pore size (7.0 nm), and largest amount of oxygen vacancies. The photocatalytic H-2 evolution properties were attributed to the preferred planes of the CeO2 NRs and the redox capacity of CeO2. The photocatalytic process is mainly related to the conversion of Ce3+/Ce4+ cycle of CeO2, and the redox capability of CeO2 is related to the amount of its oxygen vacancies.

The Co3O4 catalyst attached to the CNTs facilitated the dissociation of reaction products and reduced the overpotential of the cells. As the carbon surface activates the side reactions, the PANI coating on the carbon surface of the electrode suppressed the side reaction at the electrode/Li2O2 and electrode/electrolyte interfaces, thus enhancing the cycle performance of the electrode. In addition, the catalytic activity of Co3O4 on the CNT/Co3O4 nanocomposites remained unaffected, as the Co3O4 surface was not covered with a PANI layer due to the nature of the electropolymerization method. Overall, the synergic effect of the PANI layer and the Co3O4 catalyst leads to a superior cyclic performance and a low overpotential for the electrode based on selectively PANI-coated CNT/Co3O4 nanocomposites.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			2045-2322			WOS:000407864000077	28819249

Herein, a series of bismuth/boron-based materials are successfully anchored on different kinds of flexible substrates via simple and mild electroless plating in organic media, forming a binder-free porous structure that is conducive to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The bismuth/boron-based (Bi-B) electrodes not only have high intrinsic activity, rapid mass transfer capability, and large specific surface area, but can also be tightly loaded on the surface of the flexible, curved and folded substrate with a uniform distribution. In particular, the Bi-B/BiB3O6@HC electrode achieves highly efficient catalytic performances with an overpotential of 88.5 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 53.8 mV dec(-1) in neutral electrolyte solution (1.0 M PBS). The catalytic electrode with outstanding durability can electrolyze continuously for more than 36 h with negligible loss at an industrial-grade current density of 100 mA cm(-2). The series of Bi-B-based catalytic electrodes also maintain high catalytic activities in alkaline simulated seawater. This strategy provides theoretical support for developing robust, novel and inexpensive catalytic electrodes for hydrogen production in both neutral and alkaline seawater.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000738035600001

Single crystalline Ru1-xVxO2 nanowires show homogeneous solid-solution characteristics as well as the distinct feature of having remarkably narrow dimensional distributions. The electrochemical observations of a Ru1-xVxO2 (x = 0.28 and 0.66)-decorated Au microelectrode using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) demonstrate favorable charge-transfer kinetics of [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) and Ru(NH3)(6)(3+/2+) couples compared to that of a bare Au microelectrode. The catalytic activity of Ru1-xVxO2 for oxygen and H2O2 reduction at neutral pH increases as the fraction of vanadium increases within our experimental conditions, which might be useful in the area of biofuel cells and biosensors.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1944-8244			WOS:000330017100023	23977880

In this manuscript, the NRR performance of the transition metal anchored MoS2 monolayer with 1T atomic structure (1T-MoS2) is systematically evaluated by density functional theory computations. Our results reveal that the V decorated 1T-MoS2 exhibits the outstanding catalytic activity toward NRR via distal mechanism where the corresponding onset potential is 0.66 V, being superior to the commercial Ru material. Furthermore, the powerful binding energy between the V atom and the 1T-MoS2 provides the good resistance against clustering of the V dopant, indicating its stability. Overall, this work provides a potential alternative for the application of NH3 synthesis.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000530886400001	32255234

Pioneering work by Bessel Kok, Pierre Joliot, and many others during the last quarter century has provided valuable insight into this most unique and important chemical reaction. The late 1970s and early 1980s saw the introduction of biochemical techniques for the purification of photosynthetic complexes that have, in turn, stimulated the biophysical chemists and spectroscopists to apply high resolution techniques in order to resolve the structure/function relationships in these protein complexes. Valuable information about events at the atomic level can be gained through isotopic substitution of particular amino acids thought to be important in the catalytic process. The ability to generate functional auxotrophs in the photosynthetic cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803 has been used successfully to identify the redox active components Z and D as tyrosine residues in the reaction center of Photosystem II. In this report, we present results of the application of specific isotopic labeling for high resolution spectroscopy of purified PS II particles. We have developed analytical procedures for monitoring the incorporation of both H-2 and O-17 labeled amino acids by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopic analysis. We also show that the growth curve of cells subjected to obligate auxotrophy displays two distinct stationary phases; one that corresponds to depletion of exogenous amino acids, and a second that corresponds to the normal cell density at stationary phase. Cells harvested at the second stationary phase show little or no retention of the labeled amino acid.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0166-8595			WOS:A1993MX41700019	24317993

The hydrogen generation reaction, hydrogenation reaction for chemical transformation, detoxification of hexavalent chromium, and mixed dye (MB + RhB + MO) degradation under simulated solar-light illumination were confirmed. The essential characterization results indicated improved oxygen vacancy sites on the catalyst with enhanced photoresponse, better photocarrier separation, and facile charge transfer properties. A typical catalyst, NMZ-S10, was evaluated with a 1000-cycle CV test to demonstrate its long-term use for industrial application. Stable reusability experiments for the HER, PHR, PHC reaction, and PDM also supported the long-term application. The photocatalytic HER of NMZ-S10 could evolve hydrogen at a rate of 4000 mu mol g(-1) h(-1). 30 ppm azobenzene-to-aniline conversion was completely done in 2 h of reaction. Detoxification of 30 ppm hexavalent chromium was conducted in 70 min of reaction. Finally, 10.5 ppm MB-RhB-MO mixed dye degradation was carried out in 1 h of reaction. The as-synthesized NMZ-S10 catalyst has demonstrated its capability to overcome energy and environmental issues promisingly. The great photocatalytic activities are discussed and elucidated with a plausible mechanism to rationalize the superb catalytic performance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000703644400001

FeO has an ability to produce hydrogen, while its preparation needs high temperature to reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+ by using H-2 or CO gases. Here, Fe2O3- and FeO-based nanorods (NRs) on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate have been prepared, where the latter was obtained by doping Sn4+ ions in FeOOH to reduce Fe3+ ions to Fe2+. X-ray diffraction (X-RD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements indicate that the dominant content of Fe element on the surface of Sn-doped Fe2O3 and Sn-FeOOH samples is Fe2+. FeO-based NRs have a Fe2O3/FeO heterostructure with some SnO2 nanoparticles distributed on their surface. These prepared samples were used as PEC photoanodes under a visible-light irradiation. The results showed that the modified FeO-based NRs have a photocurrent density of 0.2 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs reference hydrogen electrode (RHE) using Hg/HgO electrode as the reference electrode. Furthermore, they also have a better photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity with a rate of 2.3 mu mol(-1) h(-1) cm(-1). The improved photocurrent and photocatalytic activity can be ascribed to the Sn-dopant, as the introduction of Sn4+ not only leads to the formation of the Fe2O3/FeO heterostructure but also increases the carrier concentration. Fe2O3/FeO heterostructure with SnO2 nanoparticles on its surface has a good band energy alignment, which is beneficial to the PEC water oxidation and reduction.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2470-1343			WOS:000513942200018	32064381

The influence of residual water in NaY was also studied in presence of O-2 in the gaseous flux. During adsorption of NO, NO2 is produced in presence of O-2 in the gas feed, due to the formation of oxygen species at the surface of the zeolite. Then, created NO2 reacts with residual H2O to form NO. Without O-2, the production of NO2 does not occur. If residual H2O is removed, reaction of NO2 with H2O leading to the formation of NO does not happen. Whether with or without O-2 in the gas feed during NO2 adsorption, the evolution of NO and NO2 outlet concentrations are similar. First, NO2 is adsorbed, producing NO by reacting with residual H2O and then, the production of NO decreases while NO2 outlet concentration increases. NO2 breakthrough time is slightly higher without O-2. In absence of residual water, no NO is produced. Concerning adsorption of NO and NO2 mixture, the evolution of outlet concentrations is different in presence or in absence of O-2. With O-2, final outlet concentrations of NO and NO2 are not equal to inlet concentrations unlike what happens without O-2. With a dried NaY sample, NO2 is adsorbed without forming NO. For all experiments performed, NO is not adsorbed whereas NaY is interesting for NO2 adsorption, even in gaseous mixture adsorption.									6	1	0	0	1	0	7			0929-5607	1572-8757		WOS:000456130200009

However, TiO2 encounters serious difficulty in achieving hydrogen evolution. One solution to this difficulty is using a hydrogen-producing semiconductor, such as silicon, and an oxidation reaction other than oxygen evolution, such as oxidation of iodide ions into iodine (triiodide ion). In this study, microcrystalline silicon (mu c-Si:H) thin films are used as photoelectrodes in the photodecomposition of HI for low-cost and efficient production of solar hydrogen. An n-mu c-3C-SiC:H and an i-mu c-Si:H layer are deposited on glassy carbon substrates using the hot-wire cat-CVD method. The mu c-Si:H electrodes are modified with platinum nanoparticles through electroless displacement deposition. The platinum nanoparticles improve the electrode's stability and catalytic activity. The electrodes produce hydrogen gas and iodine via photoelectrochemical decomposition of HI with no external bias under simulated solar illumination. We also attempt solar water splitting using a multi-photon system equipped with the mu c-Si:H thin film and TiO2 photoelectrodes in series.
