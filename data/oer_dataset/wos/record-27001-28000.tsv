Oxygen evolution is accompanied by proton release through a 35 #x212B; hydrogen-bonding network to the lumen. The mechanism of this proton-transfer reaction is not known, but the reaction is dependent on chloride. Here, vibrational spectroscopy defines the functional properties of the proton-transfer network using chloride, bromide, and nitrate as perturbative agents. As assessed by peptide C=O frequencies, bromide substitution yields a spectral Stark shift because of its increase in ionic radius. Nitrate substitution leads to more complex spectral changes, consistent with an overall increase in hydrogen-bonding interactions with the peptide backbone. The effects are similar to spectral changes previously documented in site-directed mutations in a putative lumenal pathway. Importantly, the effects of nitrate are reversed by the osmolyte, trehalose. Trehalose is known to alter hydrogen-bonding interactions in proteins. Trehalose addition also reverses a shift in an internal hydronium ion signal, consistent with an alteration in its pK(a) value and a change in the basicity of bound nitrate. The spectra provide evidence that the proton-transfer pathway contains peptide carbonyl groups, internal water, a hydronium ion, and amino acid side chains. These experiments also show that the proton-transfer pathway functionally adapts to changes in electric field, pK(a), and hydrogen bonding and thereby optimizes proton transfer to the lumen.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1520-6106			WOS:000438309800003	29924605

Here, we developed strongly coupled hybrid nanowires (NWs) of anion (Cl- and CO-) doped cobalt hydroxide coated with nanosheets of graphitic carbon nitride (Co(OH)(2)@gC(3)N(4)) through an in situ hydrothermal method. With 5% g-C3N4 added in the synthesis, we obtained perfectly coated Co(OH) 2 by g-C3N4 nanosheets with an overall diameter of similar to 110 nm and a coating layer of similar to 10 nm. The structural and compositional analyses confirm the strong interaction between gC(3)N(4) and Co(OH)(2) that makes the hybrid highly effective for the OER. As a result Co(OH)(2)@g-C3N4 NWs exhibit an excellent over-potential of 0.32 V at 10 mA cm(-2) as well as extraordinary stability, which are better than those of the state-of-the-art noble metals (IrO2 and RuO2) and most reported Co- and C3N4-based electrocatalysts although both Co(OH)(2) and g-C3N4 separately display very fair performance. Furthermore, a combination of Co(OH)(2)@ g-C3N4 and Pt/C delivers a current density of 80 mA cm(-2) at 1.9 V for overall water splitting.									69	3	0	0	8	0	70			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000382015100029

Here we report a 3D hierarchical core-shell nanostructured OER electrocatalyst, in which amorphous NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets are decorated on 3D conductive nickel phosphide nanoarrays. The integrated 3D core-shell electrode simultaneously offers excellent electrical conductivity for fast electron transfer, a large surface area with numerous active edge sites, and a hierarchical nanostructure for rapid release of gas bubbles, thus contributing to outstanding catalytic performance: low overpotentials (197, 243, and 283 mV for current densities of 10, 100, and 300 mA cm(-2), respectively), a small Tafel slope (46.6 mV dec(-1)), and superior stability, which are better than those of almost all reported LDH-based OER catalysts. When this hybrid catalyst is combined with nickel phosphide for overall water splitting, the two-electrode cell achieves current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.52 V and 100 mA cm(-2) at 1.68 V in alkaline media, which are even superior to those of benchmark IrO2 and Pt. This work paves an effective approach to design 3D hierarchical hybrid electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage.									122	4	0	0	4	0	122			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000439283200011

In this work, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic mechanism of several oxygen-terminated D-MXenes with the chemical formula of M'M-2 '' C2O2 (M' = Mo, Cr; M '' = Ti, V, Nb, Ta) is theoretically studied. For comparison, the corresponding monometallic MXenes (M-MXenes, M'3C2O2) are fairly compared by means of the density functional theory calculations. Based on our theoretical results, the HER performance of M-MXenes can be improved by constructing a "sandwich-like" ordered D-MXene configuration. Moreover, the HER performance of Mo-based D-MXenes (Mo2M '' C2O2) is superior to that of Cr-based D-MXenes (Cr2M '' C2O2), which highlights that the HER activity of Mo2VC2O2 and Mo2NbC2O2 is better than that of Pt(111). This work not only unravels the HER mechanism of D-MXenes (M'M-2 '' C2O2) but also paves the way in designing emergent MXene-based HER electrocatalysts with high efficiency.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			2470-1343			WOS:000699954000004	34568647

The anomalous behaviour of the Tafel coefficient, b, as a function of temperature was attributed to surface adsorption of the electrolyte species, and the competition between them, as well as gas bubble adherence. Comparison of the current efficiencies of the EOP, Phi(EOP), determined for different temperatures and supporting electrolyte compositions, showed the presence of fluorinated anions increases Phi(EOP). The influence of the anion nature on Phi(EOP), When analysed in the light of the proposed electrode mechanism, reveals introduction into the electrolyte of anions having a high electronegativity changes the double layer structure resulting in an increase of surface concentration of the active centres leading to EOP. The inhibition of the OER in the high overpotential domain during EOP provoked by fluoro-anion adsorption is supported by the activation energy data. In situ surface characterisation before and after EOP investigation revealed that even under drastic conditions (high current density, low interfacial pH) beta-PbO2 can be considered an inert electrode material.

However, this strategy has rarely been explored for direct and selective C(sp(3))-H activation to construct C-C bonds, which could significantly enhance the synthetic efficiency in organic synthesis. Here, we report a nickel-iron layered double hydroxide-supported gold catalyst (Au/NiFe-LDH) for efficient electrocatalytic C-C coupling reaction in direct C(sp(3))-H alkynylation of tertiary aliphatic amines with 1-iodoalkynes, which is coupled with H-2 production. Specifically, triethylamine and 1-iodoalkynes undergo efficient alkynylation to afford propargylamine in high yield (79%) and recycling ability without addition of external oxidants, coupling with 78-fold higher H-2 productivity compared with water splitting under the same potential. This work may shed light on OER-substituted reaction towards C-C bond formation reactions under mild conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1674-7291	1869-1870		WOS:000860403000001

The `tandem photoelectrolysis plant' concept: a strategy for fuel production via biomass conversion wastes								Solar energy. Chemical conversion and storage								83	115						1979	1979	One difficulty associated with the solar photoelectrolysis of water is the potential explosion hazard posed by the simultaneous evolution of hydrogen and oxygen. The evolution of oxygen can be suppressed completely in certain aqueous photoelectrolysis cells, with no adverse effect on either the photocurrent or the rate of cathodic hydrogen evolution, by simple carboxylate ions such as acetate or butyrate. In basic solutions, water-soluble products derived from the carboxylate ions are formed at the photoanode, but in acidic solutions, hydrocarbons such as ethane or hexane are formed (along with CO2) via a `photo-Kolbe' reaction. Such cells can therefore produce a valuable fuel mixture, consisting of hydrogen (from the cathode) and hydrocarbons (from the photoanode). Because both acetic acid and butyric acid are abundantly available in the aqueous effluent from the enzymatic digestion of biomass material, these observations lead to the concept of a `tandem photoelectrolysis plant', in which a photoelectrolysis device would derive its input water supply from a biomass conversion device.									0	0	0		0	0	0					0-89603-006-7	INSPEC:1569341

We have instead examined separating these challenges by investigating the energetic properties of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) that could be used as a surface coating to a material with a large enough bulk band gap. First we investigated the energetics of monolayer MoS2 and PdSe2 using density functional theory and then investigated how these energetics changed when they were combined into a heterostructure. Our results show that the surface properties were practically (<0.2 eV) unchanged when combined and the MoS2 layer aligns well with the OER and HER. This work highlights the potential of TMDC monolayers as surface coatings for bulk materials that have sufficient band gaps for photocatalytic applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0953-8984	1361-648X		WOS:000824614100001	35767988

Herein, we report a facile and economical approach to achieve an unprecedented high loading of single Ir atoms, up to similar to 18(wt)%, on the nickel oxide (NiO) matrix as the electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It exhibits an overpotential of 215 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a remarkable OER current density in alkaline electrolyte, surpassing NiO and IrO2 by 57 times and 46 times at 1.49 V vs RHE, respectively. Systematic characterizations, including X-ray absorption spectroscopy and aberration-corrected Z-contrast imaging, demonstrate that the Ir atoms are atomically dispersed at the outermost surface of NiO and are stabilized by covalent Ir-O bonding, which induces the isolated Ir atoms to form a favorable similar to 4+ oxidation state. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the substituted single Ir atom not only serves as the active site for OER but also activates the surface reactivity of NiO, which thus leads to the dramatically improved OER performance. This synthesis method of developing high-loading single-atom catalysts can be extended to other single-atom catalysts and paves the way for industrial applications of single-atom catalysts.									213	13	0	0	12	0	215			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000529156100030	32174114

This hybrid material as an electrocatalyst possesses remarkable advantages including low cost, freestanding nature, high conductivity and a unique hierarchical structure with a potential bimetallic synergistic effect. The optimized NiCoNSs/Cu-NWs electrode shows excellent HER and OER performances in alkaline solution, making it a remarkable bifunctional electrode for efficient overall water splitting. When assembling a two-electrode electrolytic cell with NiCoNSs/Cu-NWs as both the anode and cathode, it requires an applied cell voltage of only 1.69 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in water electrolysis. Electrochemical oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is also carried out in 1.0 M KOH. HMF oxidation occurs upon the formation of Ni3+ species, leading to earlier catalytic onset (around 300 mV ahead) in comparison with the OER trigged by the higher-oxidation-state Ni4+ species. When HMF oxidation and H-2 evolution are integrated into a two-electrode electrolyzer with the NiCoNSs/Cu-NWs catalyst couple, the voltage required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is 1.44 V, approximately 250 mV lower than that of overall water splitting. The present work provides useful guidance for designing and developing efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts for energy-saving hydrogen production coupled with oxidative biomass upgrading.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2398-4902			WOS:000671935000001

However, they are intrinsic nonlayered materials that cannot be delaminated into two-dimensional (2D) sheets. Here, we demonstrate a general bottom-up topochemical strategy to synthesize a series of 2D TMPs (e.g. Co2P, Ni12P5, and CoxFe2-xP) by using phosphorene sheets as the phosphorus precursors and 2D templates. Notably, 2D Co2P is a p-type semiconductor, with a hole mobility of 20.8 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at 300 K in field-effect transistors. It also behaves as a promising electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), thanks to the charge-transport modulation and improved surface exposure. In particular, iron-doped Co2P (i.e. Co1.5Fe0.5P) delivers a low overpotential of only 278 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) that outperforms the commercial Ir/C benchmark (304 mV).									61	2	0	0	1	0	61			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000496869400001	31593361

The diameter and shell size of NiCo2S4 hollow sub-microspheres are about 400 and 16 nm, respectively. In addition, the surface of the shells is constructed by petallike nanosheets. About 3 nm Pd particles uniformly incorporate with the flowerlike NiCo2S4 hollow sub-microsphere to form the NiCo2S4/Pd heterostructure. The NiCo2S4/Pd catalysts exhibit significantly lower overpotential of only 87 and 83 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) for the HER in both acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively, relative to NiCo2S4 (247, 226 mV) and Pd (175, 385 mV) catalysts. Besides, the NiCo2S4/Pd catalysts also exhibit excellent stability of HER in these two conditions. The superior HER performance of NiCo2S4/Pd might be resulted from the unique architecture of metal nanoparticles anchored on the bimetallic sulfide flowerlike hollow sub-microspheres, which could provide high surface area, lots of active sites, strong synergetic effect, and stable structure.									36	2	0	0	1	0	37			1944-8244			WOS:000438179000053	29900739

Designing and developing highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts made of nonprecious elements for OER remain a significant challenge. Herein, a fabrication of nitrogen-doped CoS2 via a facile method, and their different electrocatalytic performance in response to variations in nitrogen doping is demonstrated. Urea and NH4F are nitrogen containing reactants whose amino groups have a strong interaction with Co-2+ ions, resulting in a nitrogen containing precursor. After a sulfidation process, nitrogen doped CoS2 is obtained. An addition of a hydrogen annealing step enables the nitrogen doping process to load between 0 and 13.6%. Nitrogen doping has a significant effect on the distribution of sulfur in CoS2, which significantly improves the quality or quantity of active sites. As a result, the nitrogen-doped CoS2 shows high electrochemical activity toward OER. Notably, the N-4-CoS2-400 sample exhibits a small overpotential of 290 mV to provide a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The results in this study provide information for the utilization of heteroatoms in a rational design for enhancing electrochemical performance toward OER and may create new opportunities in other energy-related areas.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1452-3981			WOS:000514818500012

Herein, we rationally designed Cu oxide (CuOx) nanoarray film (NF) as an example to investigate the synergism and doping effects of iron group metals on OER This is an advantage because CuOx is electrocatalytically inert and oxidatively stable, which is much better than carbon -based platforms. Especially, cobalt (Co) shows a much stronger synergism as compared with nickel (Ni) and iron (Fe). By introducing Co into the inert CuOx NFs, the Co active sites can be correlated to the OER activity by rationally regulating the morphology of CuOx NFs. In addition, the phase transformation from Cu2O to CuO occurs during the OER testing, further boosting the OER activity of Co-doped CuOx NF due to the hybridization change of Co active site. As a result, the Co-doped CuOx NF with 0.30 at. % Co (denoted as Co0.30CuOx) shows a remarkable OER activity (an overpotential of 0.29 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) in basic solution, superior to those of the state-of-the-art OER catalysts. Both experimental and computational studies indicate that the introduction of Co-dopant in CuOx changes the rate-limiting step from M-OHads -> M-O-ads to M-O-ads -> M-OOHads and decreases the theoretical onset potential by 0.31 V. The optimal concentration of Co-dopant in CuOx nanocrystals renders the favorable surface properties for the electron transfer, the adsorption, and desorption of OER-relevant intermediates. Moreover, the small size of CuOx nanocrystals contributes to the large electrochemically active surface area, which enables the sufficient Co active sites to the electrolyte.									37	2	0	0	1	0	38			2155-5435			WOS:000453491100107		
J	Vohra, Manav; Weihs, Timothy P.; Knio, Omar M.				Weihs, Timothy P/A-3313-2010				A simplified computational model of the oxidation of Zr/Al multilayers								COMBUSTION AND FLAME				162	1			249	257		10.1016/j.combustflame.2014.07.010				JAN 2015	2015	A computational model is developed to describe the oxidation of nanolaminates comprising Zr/Al bilayers. The model is developed in light of recent experimental observations of reactive multilayers ignited in air. These suggest that at early stages following the completion of the formation reaction, the oxidation process is more closely described using a surface-reaction controlled growth regime; however, as the oxide layer thickens, transition to the diffusion controlled growth occurs. A simplified computational model is consequently developed that incorporates both regimes of oxide growth. The evolution of the foil temperature is described using an energy balance equation that takes into account the oxidation heat, oxygen intake and radiative heat loss. The computations are implemented to estimate the oxidation heat release rates and the temperature of the oxidizing foil, and to analyze the impact of radiative heat losses. The temperature measurements are then exploited to characterize the transition from the surface-reaction controlled growth regime to the diffusion-limited growth regime.

Inspired by the experimental realization of two-dimensional metal-organic framework (2D-MOF) nanosheets, a computational screening was performed to find out the optimal single-atom catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from 36 2D-MOFs composed of transition metal and benzene-like molecular ligands. Through first-principles calculations, six configurations were identified as potential catalysts for the HER with performance comparable to those of Pt-based catalysts due to the near-zero Gibbs free energy and favourable activation barriers originating from their appropriate d-orbital bonding mechanism with atomic hydrogen.									46	4	0	0	1	0	46			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000455001600009	30298151

Herein, we report a feasible one-step hydrothermal method to synthesize Fe-doped Co-tannic acid coordination complex nanoflowers (denoted as FexCo1-x-TA nanoflowers). It is experimentally proved that moderate Fe incorporation could effectively generate abundant O vacancies, expose more active sites and modulate the electronic structure, therefore promoting the OER activity. To be specific, the harvested Fe0.15Co0.85-TA catalyst with the optimal Fe doping content exhibits an excellent OER performance in an alkaline medium with a low overpotential of 272 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 53.9 mV dec(-1) and a faradaic efficiency of nearly 100%. This cation-doping strategy for the regulation of the electronic structure toward the performance improvement of transition metal coordination complexes is immensely instructive for the future design of affordable and efficient electrocatalysts for various renewable energy conversion systems.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2052-1553			WOS:000751968300001

However, designing and fabrication of efficient, stable, high power density electrode materials are challenging. Herein, we report rambutan-like hollow carbon spheres formed by carbon nanosheet decorated with nickel oxide (NiO) rich in metal vacancies (denoted as h-NiO/C) as a bifunctional electrode material for LIBs and electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). When being used as the anode of LIBs, the h-NiO/C electrode shows a large initial capacity of 885mAhg(-1), a robust stability with a high capacity of 817mAhg(-1) after 400 cycles, and great rate capability with a high reversible capacity of 523mAhg(-1) at 10Ag(-1) after 600 cycles. Moreover, working as an OER electrocatalyst, the h-NiO/C electrode shows a small overpotential of 260mV at 10mAcm(-2), a Tafel slope of 37.6mVdec(-1) along with good stability.

Here, an efficient bimetallic cocatalyst (named FeSnOS) was obtained by post-annealing a Fe/Sn-containing metal chalcogenide coordination compound to enhance the OER activity of BiVO4. The synergistic effect of Fe and Sn species in the amorphous FeSnOS cocatalyst efficiently lowers the interface impedance of the photoanode, reduces the electrochemical reaction overpotential, and promotes the surface OER dynamics. At the same time, a type-II heterojunction was constructed due to the process of post-annealing, which efficiently improves the bulk phase charge separation efficiency of the photoanode. The obtained optimal photoanode (named FeSnOS-BiVO4) shows a photocurrent density of 3.1 mA cm(-2)at 1.23 Vvs.the reversible hydrogen electrode, which is 3.4 times higher than that of the pristine BiVO(4)photoanode, and its onset potential shifts negatively from 0.44 V to 0.25 V. This work presents a simple and effective method to build a bimetallic cocatalyst for improved photoelectrochemical performance, which extends the application of polymetallic metal chalcogenide complexes.									8	1	0	0	1	0	8			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000547297700027	32259173

The kinetics of these solid-state reactions can be studied in situ by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray diffraction (XR-D) at elevated temperatures and defined oxygen partial pressures. Oxidation of thin cobalt foils in air was studied by means of Quick X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (QEXAFS) at the Co-K edge. By deconvolution of the spectra, the fractions of Co, CoO and CO3O4 were determined as a function of time. The overall oxidation reaction can be described by a three-step mechanism in which CoO is formed intermediately. By in situ XRD, the growth kinetics of both oxides and the depth-resolved texture of the growing oxides were determined simultaneously. At the beginning of the oxidation process, a nearly statistical distribution of oxide gain orientations is found, whereas the evolution of a distinct texture is observed during further growth of the oxide scale.

We find that this reaction can proceed exothermically only from surface precursors containing more oxygen atoms than strictly needed to produce CO/CO2 in the gas phase. The calculations show that the lowest-energy configurations of multiple O adsorbates do not involve clustering of epoxy groups (the stable form of O adatoms on graphitic surfaces) but always contain lactone groups either in lactone-ether or in ether-lactone-ether form. We identify these lowest-energy structures as the main reaction precursors. The O adatoms near the lactone group catalyze its gasification to CO/CO2 by reducing the activation energy from above 1.8 eV (from an isolated lactone) to below 0.6 eV (from a lactone-ether). In addition, the residual O adatoms left behind after the lactone gasification minimize the energy of the graphitic products by saturating the dangling bonds of the resulting defective surface. By analyzing defect-free as well as defective surfaces, we identify a common set of concerted reaction mechanisms in which the formation of the gas products and the saturation of the newly formed C vacancies happen simultaneously. The calculated activation energies are in good agreement with the available experimental data.									77	4	0	0	2	0	78			1932-7447			WOS:000288401200050

Here we propose that various physiological adaptations to oxidative stress could have forged sessility versus motility, and consequently the evolution of sexual systems in multicellular animals, plants, and fungi. Photosynthesis causes substantial amounts of oxidative stress in photoautotrophic plants and, likewise, oxidative chemistry of polymer breakdown, cellulose and lignin, for saprotrophic fungi. In both cases, its extent precludes motility, an additional source of oxidative stress. Sessile life form and the lack of neuronal systems, however, limit options for mate recognition and adult sexual selection, resulting in inefficient mate-searching systems. Hence, sessility requires that all individuals can produce offspring, which is achieved by hermaphroditism in plants and/or by multiple mating types in fungi. In animals, motility requires neuronal systems, and muscle activity, both of which are highly sensitive to oxidative damage. As a consequence, motility has evolved in animals as heterotrophic organisms that (1) are not photosynthetically active, and (2) are not primary decomposers. Adaptations to motility provide prerequisites for an active mating behavior and efficient mate-searching systems. These benefits compensate for the "cost of males", and may explain the early evolution of sex chromosomes in metazoans. We conclude that different sexual systems evolved under the indirect physiological constraints of lifestyles.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6			0018-067X	1365-2540		WOS:000533065500001	32415185

Although silver chloride (AgCl) shows high catalytic activity due to the ligand effect originating from the electronegativity difference between the two elements, its low electroconductivity remains a significant issue. Here, we report Ag-AgCl core-shell nanowires decorated with AgCl (AgCl-Ag@AgCl NWs) that have a structure capable of simultaneously exhibiting the good conductivity of a long silver (Ag) core and the high ORR catalytic activity of silver chloride (AgCl). In addition, by decorating AgCl nanoclusters on the AgCl shell, AgCl-Ag@AgCl NWs have an enlarged active surface. As a result, AgCl-Ag@AgCl NWs show highly improved catalytic performance (half-wave potential = 0.78 V vs a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), limiting current density = 4.51 mA/cm(2)). Accelerated durability tests (ADTs) confirm the high stability of AgCl-Ag@AgCl NWs after 4000 cycles of potential sweep and rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) analysis shows remarkable efficiency with the high electron transfer number (n) (3.97). We also use density functional theory (DFT) calculation to confirm charge transfer, which improves the activity of our catalysts.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			2168-0485			WOS:000661302000013		
J	Kuo, LY; Piccirilli, JA								Leaving group stabilization by metal ion coordination and hydrogen bond donation is an evolutionarily conserved feature of group I introns								BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENE STRUCTURE AND EXPRESSION				1522	3			158	166		10.1016/S0167-4781(01)00327-X				DEC 30 2001	2001	To understand the behavior of group I introns on a biologically fundamental level, we must distinguish those traits that arise as the products of natural selection (selected traits) from those that arise as the products of neutral drift (non-selected traits). In practice, this distinction relies on comparing the similarities and differences among widely divergent introns to identify conserved traits. Here we address whether the strategies used by the eukaryotic group I intron from the Tetrahymena ciliate to stabilize the leaving group during splicing are maintained in the group I intron from the widely divergent Azoarcus bacterium. A substrate analogue containing a 3'-phosphorothiolate linkage, in which a sulfur atom replaces the bridging 3'-oxygen atom of the scissile phosphate, reacts 20-fold slower in the Azoarcus reaction than the corresponding unmodified substrate in the presence of Mg(II) as the only divalent cation. However, Mn(II) relieves this negative effect such that the 3'-S-P bond cleaves 21-fold faster than does the 3'O P bond. Other thiophilic divalent metal ions such as Co(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II) similarly support cleavage of the S-P bond. These results indicate that a metal ion directly coordinates to the leaving group in the transition state of the Azoarcus ribozyme reaction. Additionally, the 3'-sulfur substitution eliminates the similar to 10(3)-fold contribution of the adjacent 2'-OH to transition state stabilization. Considering that sulfur accepts hydrogen bonds weakly compared to oxygen, this result suggests that the 2'-OH contributes to catalysis by donating a hydrogen bond to the 3'-oxygen leaving group in the transition state, presumably acting in conjunction with the metal ion to stabilize the developing negative charge. These same catalytic strategies of metal ion coordination and hydrogen bond donation operate in the Tetrahymena ribozyme reaction, suggesting that these features of catalysis have been conserved during evolution and thus extend to all group I introns. The two ribozymes also exhibit quantitative differences in their response to 3'-sulfur substitution. The Azoarcus ribozyme binds and cleaves the phosphorothiolate substrate more efficiently relative to the natural substrate than the Tetrahymena ribozyme under the same conditions, suggesting that the Azoarcus ribozyme better accommodates the phosphorothiolate at the active site both in the ground state and in the transition state. These differences may reflect either a less tightly knit Azoarcus structure and/or spatial deviations between backbone atoms in the two ribozymes that arise during divergent evolution, analogous to the well-documented relationship between protein sequence and structure.

In this study, we first prepare MIL-100 nanosheets on nickel foam (MIL-100/NF) and then successfully anchor Ag nanoparticles (NPs) on the nanosheets (Ag@MIL-100/NF) for oxygen evolution reaction (0ER) catalysis. This strategy dramatically improves the conductivity of MIL-100 and the Ag NPs are uniformly dispersed on the nanosheets. The Ag@MIL-100/NF catalyst has excellent electrocatalytic performance and long-term corrosion resistance, with a low overpotential of 207 mV and a long-term stability of at least 100 hat a current density of 50 mA.cm(-2). The experimental results demonstrate that this high OER catalytic performance is due to the improved charge transfer after loading Ag NPs, the combination of nanosheets and highly dispersed Ag NPs that expose more active sites and the adjusted chemical valence states of Fe and Ni in MIL-100. This work provides a surface decoration approach for the preparation of excellent catalysts directly used in the OER.

Here, we prove that single- and few-layer ZrS2 have an optimal band gap of about 2.0 eV and enough potential differences to drive the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction based on first-principles calculation with the Tran-Blaha modified Becke Johnson potential. Therefore, they can be used as efficient photocatalysts for solar water splitting. Moreover, we take single-layer ZrS2 as an example of tuning the band edge positions by strain in order to further improve the efficiency of solar energy conversion. The results show that a tensile uniaxial strain of 4% can minimize the difference between the conduction band potential difference and the valence band potential difference and, thus, maximize the photocatalytic efficiency of monolayer ZrS2.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) indicated a small charge transfer resistance of 77.46 ohms for sample 2, which further strengthened the OER polarization curves and indicates the favorable OER kinetics. All of the obtained results could encourage the application of sample 2 in water splitting batteries and other energy related applications.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6				2046-2069		WOS:000516545700044	35542865

Many efforts are currently devoted to the processing of multicomponent anodes and cathodes in the search for appropriate synergy between light absorbers and active catalysts. No single material appears to combine both features. Many experimental parameters are key to achieve the needed synergy between both systems, without clear protocols for success. Herein, we show how computational chemistry can shed some light on this cumbersome problem. DFT calculations are useful to predict adequate energy-level alignment for thermodynamically favored hole transfer. As proof of concept, we experimentally confirmed the limited performance enhancement in hematite photoanodes decorated with cobalt hexacyanoferrate as a competent water-oxidation catalyst. Computational methods describe the misalignment of their energy levels, which is the origin of this mismatch. Photoelectrochemical studies indicate that the catalyst exclusively shifts the hematite surface state to lower potentials, which therefore reduces the onset for water oxidation. Although kinetics will still depend on interface architecture, our simple theoretical approach may identify and predict plausible semiconductor/catalyst combinations, which will speed up experimental work towards promising photoelectrocatalytic systems.									27	0	0	0	1	0	27			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000416158500032	28967707

Herein we demonstrate a facile fabrication of various iron sulphide (FeS) nanostructures, including rice grains (RGS)-, nanoflowers (NFS)- and nanoparticles (NPS)-like surface morphologies via electrochemical, solvothermal and chemical strategies, respectively. The as-developed FeS nanostructures have been employed as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline electrolyte. Among other FeS nanostructures, FeS rice grains (FeS-RGS) exhibited an outstanding OER activity with a low onset potential (similar to 1.37 V), low overpotential (similar to 0.20 V), small Tafel slope (similar to 54.2 mV dec(-1)), high mass activity (similar to 5.4 A g(-1)), and high durability, outperforming the commercial state-of-the-art RuO2 catalyst. The high-performance OER activity of the FeS-RGS is associated not only to the synergistic effect of Fe and S, but also to the direct growth (binder-free) and edges of rice grain structures, offering a large number of electrochemical active sites and ensuring fast-diffusion of OH- ions of the nanostructures. The present one-step, low-cost and highly scalable preparation of FeS-RGS nanostructures provides new possibilities of morphology and synthetic methodology dependence of OER electrocatalysts for effective hydrogen production.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000691718800001	34533173

We report here a novel strategy to enhance the OER by developing cobalt nickel sulfide (CoxNi1-xS2, CNS) with a high density of crystalline and amorphous phase boundaries. Electrochemical activation (ECA) can partially amorphize hollow CNS nanoparticles derived from surface-selective sulfidation. The ECA-treated CNS (ECA-CNS) electrocatalyst, which is comprised of CNS nanodots separated by thin amorphous layers, shows high densities of crystalline and amorphous phase boundaries. This catalyst shows superior OER catalytic performance with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of 290 mV, a low Tafel slope of 46 mV dec(-1), a high mass activity of 217 A g(-1), a high turnover frequency of 0.21 s(-1) at an overpotential of 340 mV, and excellent stability in alkaline media.									53	3	0	0	2	0	53			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000459331600079

In particular, achieving high activity without sacrificing stability is essential for designing commercially viable catalysts. A major challenge in designing state-of-the-art Ru-based catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is a key step in water splitting, is the poor stability and surface tailorability of these catalysts. In this study, we designed rapidly synthesizable size-controlled, morphology-selective, and surface-tailored platinum-ruthenium core-shell (Pt@Ru) and alloy (PtRu) nanocatalysts in a scalable continuous-flow reactor. These core-shell nanoparticles with atomically precise shells were produced in a single synthetic step with carbon monoxide as the reducing agent. By varying the metal precursor concentration, a dendritic or layer-by-layer ruthenium shell can be grown. The synthesized Pt@Ru and PtRu nanoparticles exhibit noticeably higher electrocatalytic activity in the OER compared to that of pure Pt and Ru nanoparticles. Promisingly, Pt@Ru nanocrystals with a similar to 2-3 atomic layer Ru cuboctahedral shell surpass conventional Ru nanoparticles in terms of both durability and activity.									45	2	0	0	2	0	45			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000381056500013	27242173

However, greater attention is paid to the property of the loaded cocatalyst while the effect of varied functional facet exposure is relatively less discussed. Herein, dual-faceted BiVO4 with well-defined {010} and {110} facets but with varied {010}/ {110} exposure extent ratios are coupled with CoOx which is known as a cocatalyst for water oxidation. The enhancement induced by the cocatalyst loading depends on both its deposit location and the ratio of {010}/{110} facet exposure. When selectively deposited on oxidation {110} facet, CoOx generates over two-fold enhancement on BiVO4 in photocatalytic oxygen evolution as compared to its randomly deposited analogue. Meanwhile, the {010}-dominant BiVO4 is more obviously benefited from the cocatalyst loading to both photocatalytic water oxidation and hydrogen peroxide generation reactions with respect to the {110}-dominant BiVO4. Further investigation reveals that CoOx functions more effectively in PL quenching and generating greater band bending on {010}-dominant BiVO4, substantiating the better enhancement in reducing charge recombination and forming larger space charge region width for charge separation, which deliver greater photocatalytic activity enhancement on {010} dominant BiVO4.

The p-XRD of the nanoparticles showed the formation of the CoS phase only from all precursors. The effect of size and surface capping on energy generation and energy storage applications was investigated. The electrocatalytic performance of the synthesized samples for hydrogen (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), indicates that CoS synthesized from the octyl xanthate complex (CoS-Oct) showed higher electrocatalytic performance. A lower over potential of 325 mV and 200 mV was observed for CoS-Oct, at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), for OER and HER, respectively. The charge storage performance was also investigated, where an inverse trend was observed i.e. the highest specific capacitance (1500 F/g, at scan rate 2 mV/s) was observed for the CoS sample synthesized from ethyl xanthate (CoS-ET). Similarly, the discharge time for CoS-ET was longer as compared to the other samples, suggesting better performance for the charge storage applications. The use of cobalt xanthate complexes for the preparation of CoS by melt method, and the effect of self-capped and uncapped surface of CoS on supercapacitance and OER/HER performance, has never been investigated before.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			1369-8001	1873-4081		WOS:000513161300013

However, how to rapidly screen out highly-active 2D MOFs from numerous candidates is still a great challenge. Herein, based on the high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations for 20 kinds of different transition metal-based MOFs, we propose a factor for fast screening of 2D MOFs for the OER under alkaline conditions (pH = 14.0), that is, when the Gibbs free energy change of the O-O bond formation (defined as Delta G(1)) is located at similar to 1.15 eV, the peak OER performance would be achieved. Based on the high-throughput calculation results, the prediction factor can be further simplified by replacing the Gibbs free energy with the sum of the associated single point energy (SPE) and a binding energy-dependent term. Guided by this factor, we successfully predicted and then obtained the high-performance Ni-based 2D MOFs. This factor would be a practical approach for fast screening of 2D MOF candidates for the OER, and also provide a meaningful reference for the study of other materials.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000775108600001	35509463

In this work, the photocatalytic properties of g-C3N4 for H2O2 production was enhanced by co-modification with cyano group and SnO2 nanocrystal through a facile one-step thermal polymerization method. The cyano group and SnO2 nanocrystal broaden the photo-absorption range of g-C3N4, enhance the electron generation and transfer ability, and provide more active sites for O-2 and H+ adsorption. Significantly, this structure modification strategy leads to excellent H2O2 production performance, and the H2O2 yield rate reaches 703.4 mu M g(-1)h(-1) under visible light illumination, which is superior among gC(3)N(4)-based photocatalysts. Moreover, the reaction mechanism study indicates that the photocatalytic H2O2 production proceeds through a two-step single-electron reaction and the catalyst shows good cyclability for long-term use. This work demonstrates a novel and feasible modification approach to improve the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4, and will promote the development of advanced semiconducting catalysts for photocatalytic H2O2 evolution.									15	0	0	0	4	0	15			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000713315700001

During dismutation of H2O2, [TPL] and [MbFe(IV)] remained constant, NADH caused: (a) inhibition of H2O2 decay; (b) progressive reduction of TPL to its respective hydroxylamine TPL-H; and (c) arrest/inhibition of oxygen evolution or elicit consumption of O-2. Following depletion of NADH the evolution of O-2 resumed, and the initial concentration of TPL was re stored, Kinetic analysis showed that two distinct forms of MbFe(IV) might be involved in the process, In summary, by shuttling between two oxidation states, namely nitroxide and oxoammonium cation, stable nitroxides enhance the catalase mimic activity of MbFe(III), thus facilitating H2O2 dismutation accompanied by O-2 evolution and providing protection against hypervalent heme proteins.									157	0	0	0	127	1	163			0021-9258			WOS:A1996VN18000047	8824241

Electrochemical water splitting as one of the most effective means of hydrogen production has aroused wide interest. The development of high-activity and low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a key role in hydrogen production via water splitting. Herein, hierarchical tube brush-like Co3S4@NiCo-LDH nanoarrays in situ grown on Ni foam were successfully synthesized via a three-step hydrothermal strategy. The as-fabricated catalyst exhibits simultaneously outstanding electrocatalytic performances for both the HER (overpotentials of 210 and 251 mV at 50 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively) and the OER (overpotentials of 262 and 320 mV at 100 and 300 mA cm(-2), respectively) in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Impressively, the Co3S4@NiCo-LDH electrode presents a remarkable stability up to 100 h for the OER and HER at a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, by employing the Co3S4@NiCo-LDH as both the cathode and anode for overall water splitting (OWS), a low cell voltage of 1.59 V is required to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), along with a remarkable durability. The superior electrocatalytic activity may be attributed to the following: (1) the in situ growth on the Ni foam substrate can not only improve structural stability and conductivity but also endow faster charge transfer as well as bubble release; (2) its peculiar structure provides large active surface areas, more accessible surface active sites and fast charge/mass transport; (3) the prominent synergistic effect between Co3S4 and NiCo-LDH justifies the excellent electrocatalytic activity for the HER and OER. This work will provide a novel idea for constructing effective bifunctional catalysts for hydrogen production via OWS.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000681404100001

For example, the reduction of sulfide by microbes oxidizes vast amounts of organic carbon and the subsequent reaction of sulfide with iron produces pyrite whose burial in sediments is an important oxygen source to the atmosphere. The concentrations of seawater sulfate and the operation of sulfur cycle have experienced dynamic changes through Earth's history, and our understanding of this history is based mainly on interpretations of the isotope record of seawater sulfates and sedimentary pyrites. The isotope record, however, does not give a complete picture of the ancient sulfur cycle. This is because, in standard isotope mass balance models, there are more variables than constraints. Typically, in interpretations of the isotope record and in the absence of better information, one assumes that the isotopic composition of the input sulfate to the oceans has remained constant through time. It is argued here that this assumption has a constraint over the last 390 Ma from the isotopic composition of sulfur in coal. Indeed, these compositions do not deviate substantially from the modern surface-water input to the oceans. When applied to mass balance models, these results support previous interpretations of sulfur cycle operation and counter recent suggestions that sulfate has been a minor player in sulfur cycling through the Phanerozoic Eon.									26	2	0	0	7	0	27			0027-8424			WOS:000320328700039	23650346

The resultant OCN/SiNS composites possessed enhanced photocatalytic activity for Rhodamine B (RhB) oxidation compared to bulk CN, with a quick reaction within 55 min and an apparent rate constant of 0.073 min(-1), mainly owing to the high adsorption of SiNSs, larger specific surface area of highly dispersed OCN nanoparticles, and the adjusted band structure originated from the comprehensive effects of nanoparticle structure and O-doping, which led to a narrowed band gap with strengthened visible-light adsorption and an enhanced photogenerated carrier separation efficiency. Furthermore, in terms of the photocatalytic mechanism, it showed a more reactive oxygen species of singlet oxygen (main) and superoxide radicals (secondary) for effective RhB decomposition, but significantly lowered the oxidative ability of the holes towards RhB. This work suggests the great potential of silica nanosheets as a supporter and inducer in dispersion and structure tuning of carbon nitride for enhanced photocatalytic property.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2574-0970		WOS:000736544700001

In the samples nitrided above 973 K, gallium nitride (GaN) phase started to appear and the crystallinity became better with in-creasing the nitriding temperature. In diffuse reflectance ultravi-olet-visible measurements, absorption bands appeared in the visible light region after the nitrization, and the shift of the ab-sorption edge with nitriding temperature suggested the formation of a new phase like gallium oxy-nitride. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microsco-py-electron energy-loss spectroscopy analyses revealed that oxygen atoms were distributed homogeneously and mixed with ni-trogen atoms in the sample nitrided at 1173 K [referred as S(1173 K)] while oxygen atoms were mainly distributed at the surface of the sample nitrided at 1273 K [S(1273 K)]. The differences in the composition and chemical state near the sample surface closely related to the activity and stability during water splitting reaction under visible light irradiation between S(1173 K) and S(1273 K), i.e., the former sample provided stable H2 and O2 evolution while the latter sample was inactive and unstable.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1348-0391			WOS:000777835600001

The OER, which involves a four-electron process, is more complex whereas the HER, which involves a two-electron process, is more easy. Hydrogen is one of the promising and efficient energy carriers for renewable and sustainable energy yield. In this work, we have successfully prepared a low-cost electrocatalyst of strontium copper oxide (SCO) through a simple co-precipitation method, fol-lowed by an annealing process. The X-ray diffraction is consistent with an orthorhombic structure of SCO. The different modes of vibrations containing Cu, Sr, and O bonds were identified by using the Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectra. The scanning electron microscopy images confirmed that the in-troduction of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant allowed to control the size and morphology of the prepared material. Electrochemical measurements indicated that 2 wt% SDS-assisted SCO material ex-hibited excellent HER performance and high stability. It achieved 166 mV to deliver 10 mA/cm2 and attained the low 124 mV/dec Tafel slope value, indicating that hydrogen evolution reaction followed the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. Compared to the pure and 1 wt% SDS-SCO, 2 wt% SDS-SCO material ex-hibited a high electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of 19.3 cm2 and showed a low 0.33 Omega charge -transfer resistance, indicating the presence of supplementary active sites and enhanced electrical con-ductivity than the reference electrocatalysts. Hence, this work could be considered as a successful approach in exploring the performance of alkaline-based metal oxides in electrochemical hydrogen evolution reac-tions.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we report that the single-site Pt-doped RuO2 hollow nanospheres (SS Pt-RuO2 HNSs) with interstitial C can serve as highly active and stable electrocatalysts for overall water splitting in 0.5 M H2SO4. The performance toward overall water splitting have surpassed most of the reported catalysts. Impressively, the SS Pt-RuO2 HNSs exhibit promising stability in polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer at 100 mA cm(-2) during continuous operation for 100 hours. Detailed experiments reveal that the interstitial C can elongate Ru-O and Pt-O bonds, and the presence of SS Pt can readily vary the electronic properties of RuO2 and improve the OER activity by reducing the energy barriers and enhancing the dissociation energy of *O species.									11	0	0	0	0	0	10			2375-2548			WOS:000763326600014	35235348

An acid-tolerant electrocatalyst is described, which employs a Mo-coating on a metal surface to achieve selective H-2 evolution in the presence of O-2. In operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy identified reduced Pt covered with an amorphous molybdenum oxyhydroxide hydrate with a local structural order composed of polyanionic trimeric units of molybdenum(IV). The Mo layer likely hinders O-2 gas permeation, impeding contact with active Pt. Photocatalytic overall water splitting proceeded using MoOx/Pt/SrTiO3 with inhibited water formation from H-2 and O-2, which is the prevailing back reaction on the bare Pt/SrTiO3 photocatalyst. The Mo coating was stable in acidic media for multiple hours of overall water splitting by membraneless electrolysis and photocatalysis.									79	4	0	0	3	0	80			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000400755800021	28407339

The oxygen-containing gas was passed over a polymer sample and bubbled through a chemiluminescent probe solution of a hydrocarbon (RH: diphenylmethane, ethylbenzene or cyclohexane). Chemiluminescence was excited on disproportionation of ROO and chemically quenched due to the reaction of ROO with dissolved acceptors. Acceptors were detected at 290-350 K over polyolefins, black and silicone rubber, linoleum and rubber sediments on the leaves of plants, etc. The samples exhibit increased ability or acquire the ability to generate acceptors after treatment to induce their oxidation. Acceptors have been detected in the ambient air; the probable sources are polymeric fabrics, parts and waste, etc. in the environment. The concentration of acceptors may reach 10(-7)-10(-8) M in the air, which decreases on breathing. The rate constant for the acceptor-ROO reaction (approximately 10(9) M-1 s-1) is close to the diffusion-limited rate, whereas reactions of acceptors with hydrocarbons, molecular oxygen, strong hydrogen donors and stable free radicals (galvinoxyl) are very slow (less than 10(2) M-1 s-1) as is the self-reaction of acceptors in the gaseous phase (5 x 10(2) M-1 s-1). These unusual kinetic properties can be explained if the acceptors are assumed to be radical products of polymer destruction with bulky substituents at a partly delocalized electron centre.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			1010-6030			WOS:A1993LE67000012

In this article, taking Fructus azedarach as the raw material, a nitrogen-phosphorus double-doped carbon nanosheet material was synthesized through microwave-assisted hydrothermal treatment and high temperature calcination. The synthesized amorphous NPDC possessed multi-level pores and abundant edge defects. With an N : P ratio of 1.09, doped N and P achieved the best electronic synergistic effect and thus caused surrounding carbon to show high catalytic activity towards the ORR with a half-wave potential of 0.84 V, onset potential of 0.94 V and limiting current density value of 6.01 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media. The NPDC-1.09 also exhibited superior stability (drop of 11% at 0.8 V after 22 h) and methanol tolerance (3.2% decline) compared to 20% Pt/C. When used in zinc-air batteries, its promising application in the field of energy storage and conversion is demonstrated by its 84 h long-term cycling stability (with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)). The discovery of such an N and P dual-doped carbon structure with a substantial synergistic effect is of great significance for promoting the replacement of platinum-based catalysts with carbon-based materials.									17	1	0	0	2	0	18			2398-4902			WOS:000539290400056

In this study high DC voltage electrolysis was implemented to form nanosilver solutions with varying electrode diameters, anode-cathode distances, and electrolysis duration. The process was monitored while the cell was in operation, and the characteristics of the resulting solution were analysed afterwards. Cell reactions included: colour changes in the solution bulk due to the reduction of silver ions forming nanoparticles, anodic dissolution of silver, intense gas evolution at both electrodes, and chemical reactions in the solution causing nanosilver formation. UV-Vis characteristics, particle size distribution, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, solution concentrations, conductivities, and zeta-potentials were all found to depend on the electrode's distances, temperature, electrolysis duration, and current density. Nanosilver preparation can thus be considered a combination of electrochemical reactions (such as silver dissolution at anode and water decomposition to generate hydrogen and oxygen), and chemical reactions between the electrolytic products from the solution bulk.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1286-0042	1286-0050		WOS:000209378200004

At low energies of astrophysical interest, the contribution of the subthreshold state 6.356 MeV of 17O to the 13C(alpha,n)16O cross section should be taken into account. However, the results of previous studies of this contribution lead to different conclusions. Hence, we investigated the effect of this resonance on the astrophysical S-factor through a new precise measurement of the alpha spectroscopic factor, Salpha, of the 6.356 MeV state using the transfer reaction 13C(7Li,t)17O at two different incident energies. The measured angular distributions and the obtained spectroscopic factors will be presented as well as their impact on C(alpha,n)16O cross section and reaction rate.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0094-243X			INSPEC:10216420

The resulting material was fully characterized by various methods including infrared and one- and two-dimensional solid-state NMR. This material can further react with dehydrated polyoxometalates (POMs), leading to the formation of a covalent POM-silica bond. In the case of H4PVMo11O40, hydrogen released during the grafting reaction reduces the POM. This leads to the formation of two surface species, which can be reoxidized in presence of oxygen. In the case of H3PW12O40, no reduction is observed. In both cases, Si-29 solid-state NMR shows that the POM-silica bond is covalent, contrary to what was observed in homogeneous conditions.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000332144100023	24495150

Co2+ coordination with AuNP surface functional molecules significantly influenced the nanostructure formation and OER activity. Nanospheres of carbon with an optimum concentration of AuNPs and Co3O4 (2) showed strong OER activity. 2 exhibited a high current density (358 mA cm(-2) at an applied potential of 1.59 V) and required a low overpotential (256 mV) to generate a geometric current density (10 mA cm(-2)) compared to commercial RuO2 (363 mV). Importantly, 2 showed high mass activity (1352.5 mA mg(-1)), 14 times higher than RuO2 (93.87 mA mg(-1)). The low Tafel slope (52.4 mV dec(-1)) and charge transfer resistance along with large double layer capacitance (C-dl = 20.1) of 2 suggest strong electronic communication between the catalyst and the electrode surface and facilitated fast charge transport. Chronoamperometric studies confirmed the excellent stability of the catalyst. The present work demonstrates that the electrocatalytic activity of earth-abundant amorphous metal oxides can be strongly enhanced by integrating metallic nanoparticles (NPs) and optimizing nanostructures.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000673042000001	34259287

Because sluggish water oxidation is the bottleneck of water splitting, the design and preparation of an efficient photoanode is intensively investigated. Currently, all known photoanode materials suffer from at least one of the following drawbacks: (1) low carriers separation efficiency; (2) sluggish surface water oxidation reaction; (3) poor long-term stability; (4); insufficient water adsorption and gas desorption. Core-shell configurations can endow a photoanode with improved activity and stability by coating an overlayer that plays energetic, catalytic, and/or protective roles. The construction strategy has an important effect on the activity of a core-shell photoanode. Nonetheless, the mechanism for the improvement of performance is still ambiguous and is worthy of a closer examination. In this review, the successes and challenges of core-shell photoanodes for water oxidation, focusing on synthesis strategies as well as functionalities (facilitating carrier separation, surface reaction promotion, corrosion prevention, and bubble detachment) are explored. Finally, the perspectives of this class of materials in terms of new opportunities and efforts are discussed.									30	1	0	0	3	0	31			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000666914100001

For example, several reaction mechanisms have been proposed to explain the formation of the LiOH discharge product in the presence of LiI and water; however, none of these have been demonstrated or fully understood. A similar situation exists for the decomposition reaction, which leads toward molecular oxygen evolution. Herein we present a mechanistic theoretical study of the reactions taking place in the electrolytic media of a Li-O-2 battery with dimethoxyethane (DME) in the presence of both water and the LiI additive. The results reveal that water is the most energetically favorable source of protons yielding LiOH. The effect of iodide in lithium peroxide bond scission can be ascribed to a halogen-bond interaction. The reaction pathway involving hydrogen peroxide was found to be a viable route accounting for the lithium hydroxide decomposition.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000425840500021

Pt is the best catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the low oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of Pt prevents it from becoming a bifunctional catalyst in practical application. Ir-based electrocatalysts with good OER activities are expected to become the most promising bifunctional catalysts once their HER activities are improved. Herein, we report a simple synthesis of a Si-doped Ir electrode using magnetron sputtering. The physical and electrochemical characterization of the materials is achieved by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS). The electrochemical catalytic activity of the Si-doped Ir electrode toward the HER is demonstrated for the first time. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves reveal that the addition of Si can improve the utilization rate of Ir and result in a large electrochemical surface area (ESA). The overpotential of the Si-doped Ir electrode for the HER (eta = 114 mV, 50 mA cm(-2)) is obviously lower than that of an Ir electrode (eta = 148 mV, 50 mA cm(-2)) and very close to that of a Pt electrode (eta = 106 mV, 50 mA cm(-2)). The mass specific activity of the Si-doped Ir electrode exceeds that of an Ir electrode by a factor of ca. 2 at an overpotential of eta = 200 mV. The superior HER activity of the Si-doped Ir electrode could be attributed to the electronic structure modification of Ir by the interaction effect with Si as studied through XPS analysis. Moreover, the Tafel slope of 36.5 mV dec(-1) suggests that the mechanism for the Si-doped Ir electrode-catalyzed HER is Volmer-Tafel, in which the recombination of two adsorbed hydrogen atoms is the rate-determining step. In addition, the OER activity of the Si-doped Ir electrode outperforms that of an Ir electrode, which enables the Si-doped Ir electrode to be used as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water electrolysis.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2398-4902			WOS:000482057500010

The addition of Fe2O3 to CaSO4 was found to enhance the CO2 evolution rate and total amount of CO2 produced, with the best results, in terms of CO2 production and CH4 conversion, obtained with a 20% by weight (wt%) addition of Fe2O3 to CaSO4 (20%Fe2O3/CaSO4). The preliminary study for thermal stability and regeneratability of 20%Fe2O3/CaSO4 in the CLC of CH4 and coal was established over four and three reduction-oxidation cycles, respectively, while the morphology and solid composition of the fresh and spent oxygen carrier were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometry (XRD), respectively. The formation of Ca2Fe2O5 in the reduced 20%Fe2O3/CaSO4, as detected by XRD measurements, appeared to prevent thermal agglomeration. For the CLC of coal, the reaction was optimal at 950C.

Birnessite and cobalt-doped birnessite were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, and conductivity measurements. A cobalt:manganese ratio of 1:2 resulted in the most active catalyst, for the OER. In particular, the overpotential (eta) for the OER was 420 mV, significantly lower than the eta = 780 mV associated with birnessite in the absence of Co. Furthermore, the Tafel slope for Co/birnessite was 81 mV/dec, in comparison to a Tafel slope of greater than 200 mV/dec for birnessite. For chemical water oxidation catalysis, an 8-fold turnover number (TON) was achieved (h = 70 mmol of O-2/mol of metal). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict that cobalt modification of birnessite resulted in a raising of the valence band edge and occupation of that edge by holes with enhanced mobility during catalysis. Inclusion of extra cobalt beyond the ideal 1:2 ratio was detrimental to catalysis due to disruption of the layered structure of the birnessite phase.									32	1	0	0	4	0	32			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000422810900006	29300462

However, the processes occurring on the NiOOH surface during charge accumulation and OER are not well understood. This work presents an in situ Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) study of the pH dependent interfacial changes of the NiOOH catalyst under the working conditions used for OER. We demonstrate the important effect of the electrolyte pH on the degree of surface deprotonation of NiOOH, which crucially affects its OER activity. Our results show that the deprotonation of NiOOH produces negatively charged (or proton-deficient) surface species, which are responsible for the enhanced OER activity of NiOOH in highly alkaline pH. Moreover, we provide spectroscopic evidence obtained in an O-18-labeled electrolyte that allows us to assign this surface species to a superoxo-type species (Ni-OO-). Furthermore, we propose a mechanism for the OER on NiOOH which is consistent with the observed pH-sensitivity, and that also explains why NiOOH is not a suitable catalyst for applications in neutral or moderately alkaline pH (in the range 7-11), apart from the lower stability of the catalyst under these conditions.									345	15	1	0	27	0	348			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000372614800021	28660036

In the cyclic voltammograms of the carbon electrodes with and without Pt nano electrodeposits, the total anodic current including the currents from the oxygen evolution reaction and carbon corrosion increased abruptly above a critical potential. The oxidation overpotential of the carbon electrodes with Pt nano electrodeposits was lower than that of the bare carbon electrode. This phenomenon was more prominent at 75 degrees C than at 25 degrees C. In the potentiostatic experiments, the current transients and corresponding power spectral density (PSD) increased with increasing applied potential to the electrodes. Furthermore, the current transients for the carbon electrodes with Pt nano electrodeposits were much higher than those for the bare carbon electrode. This suggests that the corrosion of the carbon substrate can be accelerated by the Pt nano electrodeposits. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

However, the development and application of Li-O-2 batteries are still restricted by several challenging issues, including high overpotential, poor cycling life, and low round-trip efficiency, due to the sluggish electrochemical kinetic integrating oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reaction (ORR, OER) in the cathode. Therefore, rationally developing innovatively bifunctional electrocatalysts is critical to alleviate the above problems. Focusing on this, in this review, we first present a brief introduction of reaction mechanism and catalysts design requirement to comprehensively understand the correlation between electrochemical performance and electrocatalysts. After that, recent progress in advanced modulation strategies for Li-O-2 batteries with vacancies engineering, doping modification, single-atom catalysis, illumination-assisted regulation, and hybrid composites synergy are systematically summarized. In this section, the electronic structure modulation, component coordination, and defect induction strategies are also introduced to enhance the electrocatalytic activity. Finally, the remaining puzzles and perspectives are highlighted. This review is instructive to provide worthy guidance for rationally designing advanced electrocatalysts in Li-O-2 batteries.

This allowed us to determine the number of electrons transferred per reduced/evolved O-2 molecule. InO2 saturated neat BMP-TFSI the ORR and OER were found to be reversible, in Zn2+ containing IL Zn deposition/stripping proceeds reversibly as well. Simultaneous addition of O-2 and Zn2+ suppresses Zn metal deposition, instead ZnO2 is formed in the ORR, which is reversible only after excursions to very negative potentials (-1.4 V). The addition of water leads to an enhancement of all processes described above, which is at least partly explained by a higher mobility of O-2 and Zn2+ in the water containing electrolytes. Consequences for the operation of Zn-air batteries in these electrolytes are discussed. (C) The Author(s) 2019. Published by ECS.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000501996300002

The reaction is carried out with visible light irradiation at room temperature. The activities of various K-OMS-2 and metal doped OMS-2 (M-OMS-2) catalysts prepared by different synthesis procedures have been evaluated. K-OMS-2 and MOMS-2 (M = Fe, Ni) with nanorod morphology were the most active photocatalysts. Conversions obtained for these catalysts ranged from 50 to 15%. K-OMS-2 fibers gave only 5-6% conversion. All reactions gave 100% selectivity to acetone. The reusability of the K-OMS-2 catalyst was also tested. Characterization of K-OMS-2 catalysts was done using several techniques like temperature programmed desorption, UV-vis spectroscopy, average oxidation state analysis, XRD, BET and FE-SEM. As suggested by the photochemical and characterization data, synthesis methodology, morphology, mixed valency and the release of oxygen from the OMS-2 structure are important factors for the design of active OMS-2 photocatalysts. XRD and FTIR were also used to study structural changes in the catalyst after photolysis. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, nanoscale platinum ditelluride (PtTe2) has rarely been investigated, despite its potential applications in catalysis, photonics and spintronics. Of the reports published, the majority examine mechanically-exfoliated flakes from chemical vapor transport (CVT) grown crystals. This method produces high quality-crystals, ideal for fundamental studies. However, it is very resource intensive and difficult to scale up meaning there are significant obstacles to implementation in large-scale applications. In this report, the synthesis of thin films of PtTe(2)through the reaction of solid-phase precursor films is described. This offers a production method for large-area, thickness-controlled PtTe2, potentially suitable for a number of applications. These polycrystalline PtTe(2)films were grown at temperatures as low as 450 degrees C, significantly below the typical temperatures used in the CVT synthesis methods. Adjusting the growth parameters allowed the surface coverage and morphology of the films to be controlled. Analysis with scanning electron- and scanning tunneling microscopy indicated grain sizes of above 1 mu m could be achieved, comparing favorably with typical values of similar to 50 nm for polycrystalline films. To investigate their potential applicability, these films were examined as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The films showed promising catalytic behavior, however, the PtTe(2)was found to undergo chemical transformation to a substoichiometric chalcogenide compound under ORR conditions. This study shows while PtTe(2)is stable and highly useful for in HER, this property does not apply to ORR, which undergoes a fundamentally different mechanism. This study broadens our knowledge on the electrocatalysis of TMDs.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000548856100001	32498057

The new model drastically reduces the reaction rates in stellar matter at temperatures T less than or similar to (3-10) x 10(8) K, especially at densities rho greater than or similar to 10(9) g cm(-3), in a strongly screened or even pycnonuclear burning regime. We show that these modifications change the abundance of many isotopes in massive late-type stars and in particular strongly enhance the abundances of long-lived radioactive isotopes such as Al-26 and Fe-60. The reduced reaction rates also significantly complicate carbon ignition (shift carbon ignition to higher temperatures and densities) in massive accreting white dwarfs exploding as type Ia supernovae and in accreting neutron stars producing superbursts. This would require much higher ignition densities for white dwarf supernovae and would widen the gulf between theoretical and inferred ignition depths for superbursts.									96	2	0	0	0	0	96			0556-2813	1089-490X		WOS:000249786600061

The phase composition, lattice parameter and micro- structure of products after treatment in different temperatures were analyzed by XRD, SEM.

Moreover, the treatment temperature affects the evolution of alumino thermic reaction and morphology of products obviously. The content, grain size and lattice parameter of TiN in products in coke bed increase with the increasing of treatment temperature. Thermodynamically it confirms that metal Al reacts with oxygen in coke bed while it is involved in alumino thermic reduction reaction, and then it causes the lack of Al, which takes part in the alumino thermic reaction leading to a surplus rutile in the products.									0	0	0		0	0	0			1013-9826			INSPEC:10163262

For example, the charge-separated state of photoredox catalysts decayed via bimolecular back electron transfer reactions between the charge-separated molecules to decrease the lifetimes of the catalytically active species. When photoredox catalysts are immobilized on solid supports, the lifetime of the charge-separated state was remarkably elongated to enhance the photocatalytic activity. Immobilization of photoredox catalysts on electrodes is required for photocurrent generation, leading to development of solar cells. Metal-oxygen intermediates, which are active for oxidation of various substrates including water oxidation, are also deactivated via bimolecular reactions to produce inactive forms such as dinuclear metal bis--oxo complexes. Immobilization of metal complex catalysts on solid supports prohibits the bimolecular deactivation, enhancing the catalytic activity and stability. This Review focuses on recent development of immobilization of both organic and inorganic molecular catalysts on various supports for enhancement of the catalytic activity, selectivity and stability in thermal and photoinduced redox reactions.									31	1	0	0	2	0	31			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000430659500003

Earth-abundant metal oxides are among the most attractive catalytic materials for this reaction because of their robustness and scalability, but their efficiency poses a challenge. Knowledge of catalytic surface intermediates gained by vibrational spectroscopy under reaction conditions plays a key role in uncovering kinetic bottlenecks and provides a basis for catalyst design improvements. Recent dynamic infrared and Raman studies reveal the molecular identity of transient surface intermediates of water oxidation on metal oxides. Combined with ultrafast infrared observations of how charges are delivered to active sites of the metal oxide catalyst and drive the multielectron reaction, spectroscopic advances are poised to play a key role in accelerating progress toward improved catalysts for artificial photosynthesis.									22	1	0	0	8	0	22			0066-426X	1545-1593	978-0-8243-1068-4	WOS:000401335600011	28226220

Therefore, it is significantly desirable to explore high active, non-noble metal and low-cost electrocatalysts for ORR. Herein, a series of nickel salts NiNH2SO3, Ni(NO3)(2), NiSO4, NiAc2, NiCl2 , and Ni(acac)(2)] doped MnO2 octahedral molecular sieves (Ni-OMS-2) nanomaterials are successfully synthesized by a simple hydrothermal reaction and used as cathodic ORR electrocatalyst. We also demonstrate that nickel salt has a significant influence on the porous structure, morphology and ORR performance. Notably, comparing with other nickel salts-doped Ni-OMS-2 catalysts, the resulting Ni-OMS-2 with NiNH2SO3 dopant exhibits impressive electrocatalytic performance toward ORR in alkaline (0.1 M KOH), with a more positive E-onset (0.866 V) and E-1/2 (0.792 V), as well as high limited diffusion current (5.03 mA/ cm(2)), respectively. Moreover, it displays superior long-term stability and methanol tolerance than that of commercial Pt/C, and the ORR process follows an ideal 4e(-) transfer pathway. Such outstanding ORR performance primarily contributes to the well-defined one-dimensional nanorods and nickel salts doping, which are in favor of promoting electron transfer, active sites exposure and intermediates absorption during the catalytic process.[GRAPHICS].									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000847049300002

The size and shape of the final product is tuned by increasing the amount of TSCD. Random and aggregated particles were obtained in the absence of TSCD. The shape of the Mn-Ru CP nanocubes was improved using small amounts of TSCD. On further increasing the initial amounts of TSCD, regular and large nanocubes were obtained. In the presence of TSCD, the reaction was slow since the complex appeared to be more stable; thus led to controlled crystal growth. After mixing Mn(CH3COO)(2) with TSCD, a Mn-citrate complex was formed. By dropwise addition of a K-4[ Ru(CN)(6)] aqueous solution, few Mn2+ ions were slowly released from the complex to react with [Ru(CN)6](4)(-). Subsequently, the nuclei were generated and further grew to form fine Mn-Ru CP nanocubes. After regular aerobic thermal treatment, synergetic nanoporous Mn-Ru mixed oxides were obtained. The Mn-Ru oxides are promising catalysts for oxygen reduction reactions through an exact four-electron pathway. We speculate that the high catalytic activity of these oxides can be attributed to the fine cubic structure, synergetic composition between Ru and Mn, and intrinsic high electrochemical activity of the ruthenium metal.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000407304100046

The anodic dissolution of each metal was demonstrated, and electrochemical reactions were assigned using reversible potential calculation. The relative stability of metals as well as the possibility of generating pure fluorine is discussed.									15	0	0	0	1	0	16			0021-891X			WOS:000231601100007

In this work, using a facile self-template method, the optimal 2D amorphous N-doped CoFe-phosphate displays superior electrocatalytic performances toward both ORR and OER, which exhibits a lower overpotential of 313 mV at 10 mA cm-2 (Ej=10) for OER and a high half-wave potential of 0.74 V(E1/2) for ORR and a small potential gap Delta E (Delta E = Ej=10 - E1/2) of 0.80 V in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, this bifunctional electrocatalyst was applied in Zn-air battery with a high power density (74.6 mW cm-2), specific capacity (750 mAhgZn- 1), and long-term stability (over 30 h at 10 mA cm-2). Our study provided a new synthetic strategy to design and fabricate new 2D heteroatom-doped electrocatalytic materials with mesoporous structured for energy conversion applications, above all, in rechargeable Zn-air battery.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000652655900001

Though it is an eco-friendly way of producing energy for the urgent requirements, it needs to be improved to make it cheaper and more eco-friendly. Although there are several types of fuel cells, the hydrogen (H-2) and oxygen (O-2) fuel cell is the one with zero carbon emission and water as the only byproduct. However, supplying fuels in the purest form (at least the H-2) is essential to ensure higher life cycles and less decay in cell efficiency. The current large-scale H-2 production is largely dependent on steam reforming of fossil fuels, which generates CO2 along with H-2 and the source of which is going to be depleted. As an alternate, electrolysis of water has been given greater attention than the steam reforming. The reasons are as follows: the very high purity of the H-2 produced, the abundant source, no need for high-temperature, high-pressure reactors, and so on. In earlier days, noble metals such as Pt (cathode) and Ir and Ru (anode) were used for this purpose. However, there are problems in employing these metals, as they are noble and expensive. In this review, we elaborate how the group VIII 3d metal sulfide, selenide, and phosphide nanomaterials have arisen as abundant and cheaper electrode materials (catalysts) beyond the oxides and hydroxides of the same. We also highlight the evaluation perspective of such electrocatalysts toward water electrolysis in detail.									1454	63	0	0	43	2	1462			2155-5435			WOS:000389399400009

In general, however, they require tedious wet chemistry steps and delicate control while managing considerable surface energies. In addition, they often suffer from scalability issues. As part of an effort to address these issues, we developed a simple two-step thermal route to produce a nanostructured electrocatalyst with high catalytic activity from its bulk form. In this work, we demonstrate the preparation of core/shell CoO/CoSx from bulk Co3O4 as a case study. Our novel approach uses a low-temperature thermal treatment under NH3 and a subsequent treatment in a H2S atmosphere, judiciously exploiting the unique features of each reaction atmosphere. Hot NH3 treatment reduces Co3O4 to CoO, during which a significant lattice mismatch between the Co3O4 and CoO fractures crystallites, and the coalescence of oxygen vacancies introduces porosity. Subsequent H2S treatment specifically forms electrocatalytically active CoSx species on the surface of CoO. We explore the use of the resulting nanostructured CoO/CoSx as an alternative to state-of-the-art noble metal catalysts in the triiodide reduction and oxygen evolution reactions, finding that its activity is comparable to those of standard catalysts. Given the simplicity and scalability of this innovative low-temperature reaction concept, we anticipate that the present demonstration will open new avenues for the synthesis of highly active electrocatalysts.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000501213600037

Based on the three types of kinetic experiments, i.e. temperature programmed oxidation (TPO), transient examinations and gradient-free loop reactor experiments, as well as mechanistic studies presented recently a global kinetic model is established. The model includes catalytic effect of the iron oxide on soot/O-2 reaction, whereas it is assumed that NOx reduction occurs on the soot without direct participation of Fe2O3. Furthermore, the model implies global kinetic expressions for the COx formation and NOx reduction. These equations include the evolution of the surface area of soot and the correlation of reactive carbon sites (C-f) with those specifically involved in NO, reduction (C*). The kinetic model is sequentially developed by accounting for the catalytic and non-catalytic soot/O-2 as well as soot/NOx/O-2 conversion. Kinetic parameters are taken from the literature and are also determined from a fit to experimental data. Comparison of measured and calculated data shows accurate reproduction of the experiments and the model. Finally, the kinetic model is validated by some simulations. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, self-supported hierarchical NiFe LDH/VO(OH)(2) nanoflowers/nanosheets grown on a Ni foam have been synthesized via a two-step hydrothermal method. Numerous fine VO(OH)(2) nanosheets grown on NiFe LDH nanoflowers enlarge the contact area for the electrolyte penetration and facilitate ion diffusion, while the three-dimensional structure of the material also provides an extensive active surface area and plentiful accessible active sites. Moreover, the strong synergistic interaction between VO(OH)(2) and NiFe LDHs subtly modulates the electronic environment, accelerating the electron/charge transfer. As a result, the catalyst exhibits excellent electrochemical performance for OER giving a voltage of 1.51 V to achieve the current density of 100 mA cm(-2) and possessed a Tafel slope of 65 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH. In addition, the material exhibited remarkable long-term durability and stability during the 40 h measurement. This investigation provides a promising strategy for rationally designing high-efficiency metal electrocatalysts with hierarchical multi-dimensional nanostructures for OER.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000612184500031	33502421

The influence of calcination temperature, and ultrasound irradiation power, and the presence of surfactant investigated on morphology and size of SrMnO3 nanostructures. As-prepared nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. The results indicated that by changing in method and reaction condition, product appeared in different size, morphology, and uniformity. The morphology and size of nanostructures have been influenced on the properties of nano-SrMnO3. For investigation of properties, the SrMnO3 was used in catalytic water splitting for O-2 evolution in presence of (NH4)(2)Ce(NO3)(6). The effect of nano-catalysts and the concentration of (NH4)(2)Ce(NO3)(6) have been studied on O-2 evolution reaction. Results show that the efficiency of water splitting increased by enhancement in the size and uniformity of catalysts and introduced the SrMnO3 as a new and efficient catalyst for O-2 evolution reaction.									32	0	0	0	1	0	32			1350-4177	1873-2828		WOS:000412959700074	28946470

We utilized the Kirkendall effect allowing the formation of hollow polycrystalline, highly disordered nanoparticles (NPs) to synthesize highly active binary metal oxide OER electrocatalysts in alkali media. Two synthetic strategies were applied to achieve compositional control in binary transition metal oxide hollow NPs. The first strategy is capitalized on the oxidation of transition-metal NP seeds in the presence of other transition-metal cations. Oxidation of Fe NPs treated with Ni (+2) cations allowed the synthesis of hollow oxide NPs with a 1-4.7 Ni-to-Fe ratio via an oxidation-induced doping mechanism. Hollow Fe-Ni oxide NPs also reached a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at 0.30 V overpotential. The second strategy is based on the direct oxidation of iron-cobalt alloy NPs which allows the synthesis of hollow FexCo100-x-oxide NPs where x can be tuned in the range between 36 and 100. Hollow Fe36Co64 -oxide NPs also revealed the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at 0.30 V overpotential in 0.1 M KOH.									50	0	0	0	0	0	50			1944-8244			WOS:000440511900044	29953206

About F-19 (only stable isotope of fluorine), its abundance in the universe is strictly related to standard and extra-mixing processes taking place inside AGB-stars, that are considered to be the most important sites for its production. Nevertheless the way in which it is destroyed is far from being well understood. On the other hand, Na-23 presence in Globular Clusters, along with is well-known anticorrelation with oxygen has made clear that this element must be produced in previous generations stars, and intermediate-mass AGB stars are one of the possible candidates for its production. For this reason we studied the F-19(alpha,p)Ne-22 and Na-23(p,alpha)Ne-20 reactions in the energy range of relevance for astrophysics via the Trojan Horse Method (THM), using the three-body reactions Li-6(F-19,p(22)Ne)d and Na-23(d,pn)Ne-20.					9th European Summer School on Experimental Nuclear Astrophysics9th European Summer School on Experimental Nuclear Astrophysics	SEP 17-24, 2017SEP 17-24, 2017		Catania, ITALYCatania, ITALY	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2100-014X		*****************	WOS:000469325400020

Herein, we report a novel and facile strategy to create graphene wrapped electrospun carbon nanofiber (GwC) membranes through the surface-induced assembly of graphene oxide (GO) on the surface of pre-oxidized electrospun PAN (oPAN) nanofibers and subsequent carbonization. Driven by the hydrogen bonding between oxygen-containing groups of GO and tertiary amino groups of oPAN, GwC composite membranes with significantly reinforced electrical conductivity are obtained in which every single oPAN fiber is tightly and evenly wrapped by graphene sheets. Additionally, the GwC membrane is further considered as a free-standing template for an in situ growth of few-layered MoSe2 nanosheets. Compared with the graphene-free counterparts, GwC-MoSe2 composites exhibit a superior electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance in both acidic and alkaline solutions due to the highly conductive GwC back-bone, thus endowing the newly designed GwC membranes with various possibilities for applications in energy-related fields.									10	1	0	0	1	0	10			2052-1553			WOS:000379491900011

The resultant particle size of {101} facet enriched TiO2 was around 100 nm. The function of N2H4 in the hydrothermal process is not only to provide a mild basic environment, but also to promote the growth of {101} surface because of its strong reducibility. The amount of N2H4 and precursor added in the solution is also investigated, and the result reveals that nearly 100 % {101} facet can be obtained only if N2H4 were added to a certain amount, while the concentration of precursor has no influence on the final result which means that this reaction can be largely scaled up. In oxygen evolution from photocatalytic water splitting, the {101} facets exhibited different performance using AgNO3 or (NH4)(2)Ce(NO3)(6) as sacrificial agent.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000333251600001

Although a limited number of mixed metal alloy nanoframeworks have been synthesized through phase segregation of alloy phases and removal of a component, there remains a strong need for a straightforward and facile synthesis route to this important nanostructure. A wide avenue for nanoframework structures can be opened with a fail-proof method for edge-coating shape-controlled template nanoparticles. Herein, we demonstrate that lanthanide metal chlorides can selectively passivate facets of a Ni nanotemplate, leaving the edges for the growth of a secondary metal (M = Ir, Pt). The edge-deposited metal can be further in situ mixed with the underlying Ni phase to afford rhombic dodecahedral nanoframes of binary alloy phases, namely, IrNi (IrNi-RF) and PtNi (PtNi-RF). IrNi-RF showed excellent electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an acidic electrolyte, requiring and overpotential of only 313.6 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, even after 5000 potential cycles in the OER, IrNi-RF underwent little performance loss with an overpotential of 329.3 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), demonstrating excellent catalytic stability. The presence of highly active grain boundaries, agglomeration-free frame structures, as well as the presence of IrNi/IrOx interface might be responsible for the excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability.									73	2	0	0	2	0	74			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000418344200003

Herein, a functional protective layer (FPL) containing abundant oxygen sites and regular channels is proposed as the surface coating to stabilize the Zn-metal anode. Specifically, transferred free water molecules and mitigated Zn-ions can be attracted by these polar oxygen sites, beneficially reliving corrosion behavior, reducing side reactions and inducing uniform Zn deposition. Furthermore, the cross-linked structure with opening channels of FPL benefits electrolyte to quickly arrive the electrode surface and maintain the superior movement of Zn-ions. As a result, a superior cycling performance with high stability of 450 h at 5 mA cm(-2) and excellent rate behavior have been endowed by Zn electrode loading FPL. In the exploration of practical utilization, full battery consisting of Zn@FPL anode and cathode adopting commercial MnO2 powder also exhibits an outstanding capacity retention of 98.9% after 300 cycles at 0.5 A g(-1). The proposed strategy of constructing a protective layer with functional sites and opening structure shows a good guiding significance for protecting Zn-metal anode.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2566-6223		WOS:000852757100001

In this work, we proposed an electrocatalyst of a curved carbon nanocone embedded with two TMN4 active sites (TM = transition metal) and used first-principles calculations to investigate their OER mechanisms and catalytic activities. In the particular spatial confinement of a curved nanocone, we found that the distance between intermediates adsorbed on two active sites is shorter than the distance between these two active sites. This finding can be used to enhance OER activity by distance-dependent interaction between intermediates through two different mechanisms. The first mechanism in which an O-2 molecule is generated from two neighboring *O intermediates exhibits a linear activity trend, and the lowest overpotential is 0.27 V for the FeN4 system. In the second mechanism, selective stabilization of the *OOH intermediate is realized, leading to a new scaling relationship (Delta G(*OOH) = Delta G(*OH) + 3.04 eV) associated with a modified OER activity volcano (theoretical volcano apex at 0.29 V). The studied mechanisms of the spatial confinement of a carbon nanocone provide a new perspective for designing efficient OER catalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	3			1948-7185			WOS:000629172200011	33635648

Herein, we present a metal-organic framework (MOF)-etching strategy to design free-standing and hierarchical hollow CoS2-MoS2 heteronanosheet arrays for both HER and OER. Resulting from the controllable etching of MOF by MoO42- and in-situ sulfuration, the obtained CoS2-MoS2 possesses abundant heterointerfaces with modulated local charge distribution, which promote water dissociation and rapid electrocatalytic kinetics. Moreover, the two-dimensional hollow array architecture can not only afford rich surface-active sites, but also facilitate the penetration of electrolytes and the release of evolved H-2/O-2 bubbles. Consequently, the engineered CoS2-MoS2 heterostructure exhibits small overpotentials of 82 mV for HER and 266 mV for OER at 10 mA cm(-2). The corresponding alkaline electrolyzer affords a cell voltage of 1.56 V at 10 mA cm(-2) to boost overall water splitting, along with robust durability over 24 h, even surpassing the benchmark electrode couple composed of IrO2 and Pt/C. The present work may provide valuable insights for developing MOF-derived heterogeneous electrocatalysts with tailored interface/surface structure for widespread application in catalysis and other energyrelated areas.

Herein, Ni/Fe/Cu-filled N-doped carbon nanohorns (CNHs) are synthesized via a positive pressure assisted arc discharge method using a Ni/Fe/Cu rod charged in an anode hole in a N-2 and Ar mixture. We first found that the amount of N atom doping can be controlled by the types of nano-metal particles encapsulated by CNHs. The content of N atoms on CNHs uniquely depended on the initial Ni wires inserted into the anode graphite; increasing the number of Ni wires induced the enrichment of N atoms until 3.56 at%, whereas the content of N atoms for Cu- and Fe-filled CNHs is against the results; loading Cu and Fe nanoparticles decreases the N-doping amount. And the morphologies and N-configurations can be changed by the types of metal nanoparticles. Furthermore, the OER performance of Ni-filled CNHs is much superior to that of Cu- and Fe-filled CNHs, which can be significantly enhanced by the tip opening structure, and the increase in Ni loading amount and the N atom content.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000779730800001	35425045

EMSI is the transfer of charge from the support to NP, enabling more effective adsorption and interaction of reactants during catalysis. Ru NPs on CuO supports show different levels of EMSI (via charge transfer) depending on their crystal structure, with multiple twinned NPs showing greater potential for EMSI. We use magnetron-assisted gas phase aggregation for the synthesis of batches of Ru NPs with different populations of single crystal and multiple twinned nanoparticles, which were deposited on CuO nanowires (NWs). The surface charging of the Ru-CuO catalysts was investigated by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). By doubling the population of multiple twinned NPs, the surface potential of the Ru-CuO catalysts increases roughly 4 times, coinciding with a similar increase in the amount of Ru4+. Therefore, tuning the amount of EMSI in a catalyst is possible through changing the population of multiple twinned Ru NPs in the catalyst. Increasing the amount of multiple twin NPs resulted in improved activity in the oxygen evolution reaction (a roughly 2.5 times decrease in the overpotentials when the population of multiple twinned NPs is increased) and better catalyst stability. This improvement is attributed to the fact that the multiple twin NPs maintained a metallic character under oxidation conditions (unlike single crystal NPs) due to the EMSI between the NP and support.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000607350900006	33350421

Utilizing the density functional theory (DFT) calculations to rationalize the thermodynamics and kinetics of adsorption of OER, juxtaposed with cohesive energy and electronic structure, we report the generation of 10 wt % fluorine (F)-doped (Mn1-xNbx)O-2:10F nanorods (NRs) as active and durable PGM-free solid solution electrocatalysts for acid-mediated OER. The DFT calculations reveal an optimal solid solution composition of (Mn0.8Nb0.2)O-2:10F containing Nb and F in alpha-MnO2 structure, exhibiting the optimized surface electronic structure (Delta G for the OER rate-determining step similar to 1.72 eV) and cohesive energy (E-coh similar to -16.30 eV/(formula unit)) for OER, contributing to its higher catalytic performance in comparison to alpha-MnO2. Consequently, (Mn1-xNbx)O-2:10F compositions with well-defined one-dimensional (1D) nanorod architectures are synthesized with the optimal composition of (Mn0.8Nb0.2)O-2:10F, demonstrating improved electrocatalytic performance for acidic OER in good agreement with the DFT calculations. The superior electrochemical performance of (Mn0.8Nb0.2)O-2:10F NRs includes significantly lower charge transfer resistance (similar to 11.8 Omega cm(2)), lower Tafel slope (similar to 371.17 mV dec(-1)), lower overpotential to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(geo)(-2) (similar to 0.68 V), higher mass activity (similar to 29 A g(-1)), large electrochemically active surface area (ECSA similar to 26.28 m(2) g(-1)), and turnover frequency (TOF similar to 0.0065 s(-1)) with higher BET and ECSA normalized activity (similar to 0.5 mA cm(-2) (BET) and 0.11 mA cm(-2) (ECSA)) contrasted with (Mn1-xNbx)O-2:10F (x = 0, 0.1, and 0.3) compositions, at an overpotential of 0.67 mV. Further, (Mn0.8Nb0.2)O-2 :10F NRs exhibit good electrochemical stability in acidic OER regimes, with no substantial catalytic activity degradation, validating its structural robustness for prolonged OER and making it a promising PGM-free OER electrocatalyst for acid-mediated PEMWE.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2574-0962			WOS:000510104700062

Herein, we report pyrite NiS2 nanosheets doped with vanadium heteroatoms as bifunctional electrode materials for both hydrogen- and oxygen-evolution reaction (HER and OER). Notably, the electronic structure reconfiguration of pyrite NiS2 is observed from typical semiconductive characteristics to metallic characteristics by engineering vanadium (V) displacement defect, which is confirmed by both experimental temperature-dependent resistivity and theoretical density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, elaborate X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements reveal that electronic structure reconfiguration of NiS2 is rooted in electron transfer from doped V to Ni sites, consequently enabling Ni sites to gain more electrons. The metallic V-doped NiS2 nanosheets exhibit extraordinary electrocatalytic performance with overpotentials of about 290 mV for OER and about 110 mV for HER at 10 mA cm(-2) with long-term stability in 1 M KOH solutions, representing one of the best non-noble-metal bifunctional electrocatalysts to date. This work provides insights into electronic structure engineering from well-designed atomic defect metal sulfide.									237	16	0	0	9	0	242			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000416878100105	29131577

In this study, the pyrolysis of light or heavy density polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE) and their mixture with the biochar produced from gasification of poplar wood as catalyst was investigated. The results showed that, during the co-pyrolysis of LDPE and HDPE in absence or presence of biochar catalyst, cross-interaction of reaction intermediates originated from the degradation of LDPE and HDPE substantially promoted the formation of gaseous products and the evolution of heavy organics with Tc-conjugated structures in the tar. During the pyrolysis of HDPE, more heavy tar while less wax was produced, while it was contrary during the pyrolysis of LDPE. In the catalytic pyrolysis of LDPE, the volatiles could be effectively cracked over the biochar catalyst, forming more gases, while in the catalytic pyrolysis of HDPE, instead of catalyzing the cracking of the heavy components, the biochar catalyzed the polymerisation reactions. The properties of the biochar catalyst in terms of crystallinity, surface functionality, and internal structures also changed remarkably due to the transfer of oxygen-containing species from the polyethylene to biochar and the interaction of biochar with volatiles in the pyrolysis.									44	1	0	0	8	0	44			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000569380400004	32544769

A hydrogen-bonding network plays a catalytic role in photosynthetic oxygen evolution								PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				109	16			6112	6117		10.1073/pnas.1200093109				APR 17 2012	2012	In photosystem II, oxygen evolution occurs by the accumulation of photo-induced oxidizing equivalents at the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). The sequentially oxidized states are called the S-0-S-4 states, and the dark stable state is S-1. Hydrogen bonds to water form a network around the OEC; this network is predicted to involve multiple peptide carbonyl groups. In this work, we tested the idea that a network of hydrogen bonded water molecules plays a catalytic role in water oxidation. As probes, we used OEC peptide carbonyl frequencies, the substrate-based inhibitor, ammonia, and the sugar, trehalose. Reaction-induced FT-IR spectroscopy was used to describe the protein dynamics associated with the S-1 to S-2 transition. A shift in an amide CO vibrational frequency (1664 (S-1) to 1653 (S-2) cm(-1)) was observed, consistent with an increase in hydrogen bond strength when the OEC is oxidized. Treatment with ammonia/ammonium altered these CO vibrational frequencies. The ammonia-induced spectral changes are attributed to alterations in hydrogen bonding, when ammonia/ammonium is incorporated into the OEC hydrogen bond network. The ammonia-induced changes in CO frequency were reversed or blocked when trehalose was substituted for sucrose. This trehalose effect is attributed to a displacement of ammonia molecules from the hydrogen bond network. These results imply that ammonia, and by extension water, participate in a catalytically essential hydrogen bond network, which involves OEC peptide CO groups. Comparison to the ammonia transporter, AmtB, reveals structural similarities with the bound water network in the OEC.									42	0	1	0	19	0	43			0027-8424			WOS:000303246100046	22474345

Chitosan is a nitrogen rich (similar to 7 wt %) renewable biomass resource derived from seafood waste. Nitrogencontaining functional groups (amine and acetamide) of chitosan make it a suitable precursor for the synthesis of N-doped carbon materials. This perspective provides an overview on various techniques for the preparation and characterization of chitosan-based N-doped carbon materials and their application in the field of electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. Additional doping with nitrogen imparts greater electrochemical stability and basic character to the material due to the ability of nitrogen atoms to accept electrons. Nevertheless, each type of C-N bonding configuration has unique potential for catalytic reactions attributed to different electronic structure and catalytically active sites. The ability to acquire desired N-bonding states during the process of doping will provide a better control over the material application. The promising performance of chitosan-based N-doped carbon materials in electrocatalytic and photocatalytic reactions is attributed to their improved electronic structure and charge transfer properties. Moreover, research trends toward the design of chitosan-based N-doped carbons materials with required features for electrocatalytic and photocatalytic applications have also been identified.									65	1	0	0	5	0	65			2168-0485			WOS:000526592900003

Physico-chemical study of reactions between a magnesia-graphite refractory and liquid steel								Key Engineering Materials				132-1363				1854	7						1997	1997	Immersion experiments of magnesia-graphite refractory samples in liquid steel at 1600degC have been carried out at laboratory scale. These experiments have shown the build up of a dense and continuous MgO-rich layer, at the interface between refractory and steel, and the possible formation of inclusions as large clusters protruding from the refractory surface. The MgO-rich layer and the inclusions arise from the reduction of magnesia by carbon from the refractory and the subsequent oxidation of the magnesium vapour in contact with liquid steel. Microscopic observations and thermodynamic calculations lead us to propose a mechanism of formation of this MgO-rich layer, whose composition and thickness are related to the chemical composition of the metallic bath, particularly to the oxygen activity (at the interface between refractory and steel) and its evolution with time.					5th European Ceramic Conference.

Simulations of processes related to H-2-O-2 PEM fuel cells								JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				607	1-2			17	24		10.1016/j.jelechem.2006.09.003				SEP 1 2007	2007	The understanding of elementary processes occurring in low-temperature H-,-O-2 polymer-electrolyte-membrane (PEM) fuel cells is still limited due to their complexity on atomic and mesoscopic scales. Here, we present Monte Carlo analysis of two related problems. (i) Due to phase separation of the hydrophobic polymer chains and water, polymer electrolytes such as wetted NAFION are heterogeneous on the scale of about 10 nm and accordingly can be viewed as a porous solid filled by water. One of the physically reasonable models of such pores can be constructed using 3D Ostwald ripening of a lattice gas with attractive interactions. Employing this model, we perform simulations of random-walk diffusion of guest particles in pores. The tracer diffusion coefficient is demonstrated to rapidly decrease with decreasing porosity and near the percolation threshold to be described by the power law. The threshold porosity and the corresponding dynamic exponent are found to be 0.23 +/- 0.01 and 0.82 +/- 0.01. (ii) The experiments show that the kinetics of O-2 reduction on Pt (with NAFION as electrolyte) is first order in O-2 in a wide range of reaction conditions. In addition, there are indications that during this reaction the atomic-oxygen coverage may be appreciable. These two findings can be adjusted taking into account the effect of repulsive lateral interactions between oxygen adatoms on the reaction kinetics. The surface mobility of these atoms may be low. We show that the influence of the latter factor on the reaction kinetics is minor. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000249177100004

However, their development is limited by their electrocatalytic activity and stability of the electrode materials used. Herein, we report a novel perovskite oxide electrode Pr0.5Ba0.5Fe0.8Ni0.2O3-delta (PBFN) as a highly effective SSOC electrode material. The results demonstrate that PBFN has outstanding electrocatalytic potential for the oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, and hydrogen oxidation reaction. After H-2 treatment, its structure changes from single to double perovskite and is accompanied by Fe-Ni alloy nanoparticle exsolution. Compared with PBFN, the SSOCs with reduced PBFN qualities show improved electrochemical performance. A reduced PBFN-based device has a higher power density (0.201 W cm(-2)vs. 0.151 W cm(-2) for H-2 as a fuel at 750 degrees C) and an electrolysis current density (0.524 A cm(-2)vs. 0.353 A cm(-2) for the electrolysis of pure CO2 at 750 degrees C @ 2 V) in comparison to the PBFN approach as is the case with other symmetric cell results. Thus, the reduced PBFN-based device shows favorable stability for both power density and electrolysis modes. These results suggest that phase transition and nanoparticle exsolution is a promising strategy for high performance SSOCs.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000825687600001

The catalyst exhibits encouraging oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution activities in an alkaline medium. Rotating disc electrode experiments show the exceptional bi-functional activity of nano LCCO (1.14 V) compared to bulk LCCO and nano LCO and is comparable to that of state of the art Pt/C and RuO2. Moreover, nano LCCO demonstrates excellent catalytic activity in zinc-air batteries at 5 mA cm(-2) current density by consuming open air. A primary zinc-air battery displays a discharge capacity of 270 mA h g(-1) for over 5.4 h. Rechargeable zinc-air batteries show stable electrochemical activity over 50 charge-discharge cycles and an enhanced rate performance of up to 20 mA cm(-2). Post-mortem analysis of the anode and cathode catalyst by XRD and FE-SEM depicts ZnO formation and a few strategies to suppress ZnO formation have been discussed, which results in enhanced cycling stability and C-rate performance. The results presented herein make nano LCCO a highly efficient and feasible bi-functional catalyst for rechargeable zinc-air battery applications.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2398-4902			WOS:000487670300009

Their application and postsynthesis under strong oxidative environments are emerging. However, the stability, physicochemical property evolution, and possible postmodification and postsynthesis of MOFs in strong oxidative solutions are largely unknown. In this paper, the behaviors of a series of MOFs in bubbled aqueous ozone (O-3) solutions are studied. The chosen MOFs are categorized into trimesic type including MIL-101(Fe) and MIL-96(Al); terephthalic type including MOF-74(Co), UiO-66(Zr), MIL-53(AI), and MIL-101(Cr); and imidazole type including ZIF-67(Co) and ZIF-8(Zn), based on the ligand structure. The intrinsic stability and evolution of the physicochemical properties of these MOFs during aqueous O-3 treatment are elucidated using structural, morphological, textural, thermal, and spectroscopic analyses. Several stable, metastable, and instable MOFs are identified. The critical parameters that determine the stability and capability for postsynthesis of these MOFs in aqueous 03 solutions are discussed. The stability follows the general order of trimesic-type > terephthalic-type >> imidazole-type MOFs because of the distinct antioxidation capability of the ligands. The effects of the ligand, metal cation, and their coordination number on stability are discussed. MIL-100(Fe), MIL-96(AI), and MOF-74(Co) are stable in aqueous O-3. UiO-66(Zr), MIL53(Al), and MIL-101(Cr) are metastable that their porosity, particle size, and crystallinity can be postmodified. ZIF-67(Co) and ZIF-S(Zn) are instable and can be gradually and completely disassembled. Their particle size and morphology and surface groups can be tuned by controlling the treatment time. Postsynthesis of metal hydroxides from ZIF-67(Co) and gradual release of dissolved zinc ion from ZIF-8(Zn) are achievable. The stable MIL-96(AI) shows promising performance in catalytic ozonation for degrading 4-nitrophenol, and the alpha-Co(OH)(2) derived from treating ZIF-67(Co) shows highly promising performance in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER).									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000662086600067	34038089

One of the most important issues for efficient water splitting is to develop cost-effective and highly efficient electrocatalysts to drive sluggish oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) at the anode side. Notably, structural transformation such as surface oxidation of metals or metal nonoxide compounds and surface amorphization of some metal oxides during OER have attracted growing attention in recent years. The investigation of structural transformation in OER will contribute to the indepth understanding of accurate catalytic mechanisms and will finally benefit the rational design of catalytic materials with high activity. In this Review, we provide an overview of heterogeneous materials with obvious structural transformation during OER electrocatalysis. To gain insight into the essence of structural transformation, we summarize the driving forces and critical factors that affect the transformation process. In addition, advanced techniques that are used to probe chemical states and atomic structures of transformed surfaces are also introduced. We then discuss the structure of active species and the relationship between catalytic performance and structural properties of transformed materials. Finally, the challenges and prospects of heterogeneous OER electrocatalysis are presented.									60	0	0	0	2	0	59			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000718326200005	34523916

X-ray diffraction pattern shows that the material has single cubic phase. Temperature dependence of relative dielectric constant exhibits diffuse phase transition in the present compound. Frequency dependence of the real (Z') and imaginary (Z '') parts of the electric impedance spectroscopy reveal contribution due to grain (bulk) resistance in a wide temperature range and indicate that the relaxation mechanism is less temperature dependent and strongly influenced by oxygen vacancies and charge carrier.

In the present study, we explored the relationship between a material's properties and electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by combining the BV equation with first-principle calculations, and concluded that the band gap and conductivity of the material function as descriptors of its electrocatalytic activity as well as Gibbs adsorption free energy. Furthermore, 13 kinds of modification methods, all aimed at developing an earth-abundant catalyst Co3O4 with heteroatoms doped in three different crystal sites, were designed and evaluated by a series of predictive first-principle calculations. Special attention was focused on modification with carbon element doping, which notably narrowed the band gap, lowered the polaron migration barrier, and reduced the Gibbs free energy. The selected configuration of the modified electrocatalyst was accomplished by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition with a low-energy input to assure the appropriate doping site of carbon atoms. A remarkable catalytic activity of 235 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER on carbon-doped Co3O4 nanosheets demonstrated the rationality and feasibility of theoretical prediction by comparing this performance with that of the unmodified sample of 423 mV. The theoretical study and calculation prediction proposed here, which is also applicable for other catalysts and even other electrochemical reactions would be helpful for designing new materials or novel modification methods via reducing the failure rate and cost.									13	2	0	0	0	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000460687400028

Furthermore, Cu0.3Co2.7O4 interconnected nanochains are employed as electrocatalyst for water oxidation in alkaline medium for the first time. Extensive studies of physiochemical properties showed the formation of interconnected 1D nanochains of Cu0.3Co2.7O4 exhibiting a larger specific surface area (139.5 m(2) g(-1)) and enhanced electrochemical water oxidation ability. It delivered excellent mass activity (similar to 50.0A g(-1)), high anodic current density (similar to 124.9 mA cm(-2) at 1.75 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode), and turnover frequency (similar to 4.26 X 10(-2) s(-1)) in 1.0 M KOH. These Cu0.3Co2.7O4 nanochains also demonstrated low overpotential (similar to 351 mV) and good cycling stability (1000 cycles) in strong alkaline media. The fabricated Cu0.3Co2.7O4 nanochains could be a good alternative to the commercial OER electrocatalysts (RuO2 and IrO2) and also advantageous to the development of efficient, cost-effective, and durable electrocatalysts for electrochemical water splitting.									39	1	0	0	1	0	39			1944-8244			WOS:000405764700031	28598596	
J	Wang, Yuanhui; Hao, Liang; Bai, Minli								Modeling the multi-step discharge and charge reaction mechanisms of non-aqueous Li-O-2 batteries								APPLIED ENERGY				317						119189	10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119189				JUL 1 2022	2022	The modeling study plays a critical role in understanding the reaction mechanisms and predicting the performance of lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) batteries. Although several models have successfully captured the discharge behaviors of the Li-O2 batteries, modeling the charge behaviors of the Li-O2 batteries is a challenge due to lacking a thorough understanding of the related reaction processes. This work proposes a multi-step reversible discharge/charge model for the non-aqueous Li-O2 batteries. Both the surface and solution reaction pathways of lithium peroxide (Li2O2) are taken into account. The proposed model can predict the discharge behaviors well, and more importantly, can accurately capture the charge behaviors of the Li-O2 batteries by considering the following three aspects: the effect of Li2O2 morphology on its decomposition potential, the evolution of interfacial resistance by Li2O2 film collapse, and the different desorption rates of absorbed lithium superoxide (LiO*2) in different electrolytes. Based on this model, the discharge/charge processes of the Li-O2 batteries using dimethoxyethane(DME), tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) electrolytes, as well as a redox mediator TEMPO, are simulated and verified. The Li2O2 formation/decomposition through the surface and solution pathways are dominated by the specific surface area of the electrode and the potential, respectively. The Li2O2 generated by the solution pathway is more difficult to be decomposed during charge. The use of redox mediator TEMPO lowers the discharge capacity of the Li-O2 batteries due to the weakened solution reaction, while remarkably reduces the reversible capacity loss. The desorption time constant of LiO*2 in electrolyte is a critical parameter that determines the degree of the reaction through the solution pathway, thus determining the discharge/charge cycling performance of the Li-O2 batteries with various electrolytes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0306-2619	1872-9118		WOS:000799956300005

However, heavy chemical doping usually leads to the reduction of electrical conductivity because the catalytically active dopants give rise to additional electron scattering and hence increased electrical resistance. A hierarchical nanoporous graphene, which is comprised of heavily chemical doped domains and a highly conductive pure graphene substrate, is reported. The hierarchical nanoporous graphene can host a remarkably high concentration of N and S dopants up to 9.0 at% without sacrificing the excellent electrical conductivity of graphene. The combination of heavy chemical doping and high conductivity results in high catalytic activity toward electrochemical hydrogen production. This study has an important implication in developing multi-functional electrocatalysts by 3D nanoarchitecture design.									55	2	0	0	2	0	55			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000445445700056	30144267

Improving the apparent HER activity of MoS2 to a level comparable to that of Pt is an essential premise for the commercial use of MoS2. In this work, a Zn-doping strategy is proposed to enhance the HER performance of MoS2. It is shown that tiny Zn doping into MoS2 leads to the enhancement of the electrochemical surface area, increases in proportion of HER active 1T phase in the material and formation of catalytic sites of higher intrinsic activity. These benefits result in a high-performance HER electrocatalyst with a low overpotential of 190 mV(@10 mA cm(-2)) and a low Tafel slope of 58 mV dec(-1). The origin for the excellent electrochemical performance of the doped MoS2 is rationalized with both experimental and theoretical investigations.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000702456700001	34431564

However, in NiFe-LDH, major catalytic active sites are situated at the edge sites, and the oxygen evolution active sites are impeded by the close-packed basal planes. Hence, activating these basal planes to participate in water oxidation is ideal for improving water splitting efficiency. In the present study, we synthesized NiFe-LDH by cation-exchange (NiFe-CE) and activated the basal planes for an efficient water oxidation reaction. After depositing NiFe-CE on BiVO4 nanostructures and measuring their maximum photocurrent density of 4.03 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under simulated solar light, the water oxidation efficiency was verified. Furthermore, their catalytic activity was compared with that of NiFe-LDH nanosheets synthesized through conventional techniques such as hydrothermal synthesis (NiFe-HT), solvothermal synthesis (NiFe-ST), and electrochemical deposition (NiFe-ED). The results demonstrated that NiFe-LDH derived through cation exchange exhibited higher catalytic activity than those that derived through other synthesis methods due to its abundance of catalytically active sites, high charge transport rate, and suitable water oxidation-reduction potentials. We hope that the present work provides a new way to activate catalytically active sites and facilitates the optimization of cost-effective, efficient, and durable oxygen evolution catalysts.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000708526900005

However, electrode performance is typically limited by low utilization of active sites, which causes a considerable drop in energy density. To overcome this issue, a single-atom-containing integrated electrode is developed through a confinement synthesis strategy by using organic molecule-intercalated layered double hydroxides (LDHs) as precursors. The as-prepared integrated electrode has a well-defined nanosheet array structure with a homogeneous anchored single atomic Co catalyst and many exposed hierarchical pores. Moreover, the coordination environment of single atoms (Co-N or Co-S) is precisely controlled by regulating the type of interlayer molecules in the LDHs. Consequently, the optimized electrode exhibits high bifunctional activity toward both the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. This electrode is directly assembled into an all-solid-state zinc-air battery that showed outstanding flexibility and long-term charge/discharge stability. Because of the versatility of LDH materials, it is expected that the proposed strategy can be extended to the construction of other integrated electrodes for high-performance energy storage and conversion devices.									27	3	0	0	1	0	28			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000597414000001

And Ni(Fe)OxHy especially attractive as a state-of-the-art best candidate catalyst for efficient electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In previous research, Cr has been reported could benefit the Ni(Fe)OxHy catalysts with conflicting mechanism. Here, a series of ternary (Ni, Fe and Cr) amorphous metal oxide catalysts for OER are synthesized via a simple thermal decomposition method. We show that Ni0.6Fe0.3Cr0.1Ox has a turnover frequency of 0.046 +/- 0.004 s(-1) at 300mV overpotential which is similar to 31% more active than an analogous Ni0.6Fe0.4Ox film, 0.035 +/- 0.007 s(-1), in 0.1M KOH media. Using electrochemical voltammetry and AC impedance analysis, we demonstrate that Cr increases the number of electrochemically available active sites, as a pore forming agent, but does not affect the intrinsic per metal atom activity. We find that the Cr begins to leach immediately upon electrochemical testing, and the Cr is almost completely depleted after a 24 h stability test. Importantly, along with the decreased content of Cr, the catalyst activity is further promoted. Although the Cr itself may not be responsible for the improvement, its dissolution results in an ideal type of pore and/or active sites. We further optimize the deposition of high-surface-area and high-mass-loading Ni0.6Fe0.3Cr0.1Ox on carbon-cloth electrodes and demonstrate an overpotential as low as 251mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1M KOH.

To this end, copper complexes keep attracting interest as good catalysts for the OER, and metal complexes with TMC (TMC = 1,4,8,11-tetramethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane) stand out as active OER catalysts. A mononuclear copper complex, [Cu(TMC)(H2O)](NO3)(2) (TMC = 1,4,8,11-tetramethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane), combined both key features and was previously reported to be one of the most active copper-complex-based catalysts for electrocatalytic OER in neutral aqueous solutions. However, the functionalities and mechanisms of the catalyst are still not fully understood and need to be clarified with advanced analytical studies to enable further informed molecular catalyst design on a larger scale. Herein, the role of nanosized Cu oxide particles, ions, or clusters in the electrochemical OER with a mononuclear copper(II) complex with TMC was investigated by operando methods, including in situ vis-spectroelectrochemistry, in situ electrochemical liquid transmission electron microscopy (EC-LTEM), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis. These combined experiments showed that Cu oxide-based nanoparticles, rather than a molecular structure, are formed at a significantly lower potential than required for OER and are candidates for being the true OER catalysts. Our results indicate that for the OER in the presence of a homogeneous metal complex-based (pre)catalyst, careful analyses and new in situ protocols for ruling out the participation of metal oxides or clusters are critical for catalyst development. This approach could be a roadmap for progress in the field of sustainable catalysis via informed molecular catalyst design. Our combined approach of in situ TEM monitoring and a wide range of complementary spectroscopic techniques will open up new perspectives to track the transformation pathways and true active species for a wide range of molecular catalysts.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000648552500035	33886278

The synchrotron XANES has been used for sulfur speciation. Coal pyrolysis was first carried out in a lab-scale drop-tube furnace (DTF). The resulting char was then size-segregated and gasified in O-2/N-2 and O-2/CO2 gases to examine the evolution of sulfur as a function of particle residence time and oxygen fraction in bulk gas. The results indicate that thiophenic sulfur is the predominant form for sulfur in raw coal and its pyrolysis char. The substitution of O-2/CO2 for O-2/N-2 slightly increased the rate of mass loss of sulfur upon char gasification, due to thermodynamically viable routes for the decomposition of thiophene into COS and CS2 in CO2, rather than HS in N-2. For the small char particle rich in highly reactive alkali and alkaline earth metals, the extra loss of sulfur in CO2 was readily stabilized into sulfate on the local char surface at a relatively long residence time of about 1.6 s in the DTF. The participation of inherent oxygen in char is essential for the sulfation reaction; however, this was inhibited by introducing oxygen into the bulk gas. The rapidly decomposed sulfur present in gaseous oxides preferentially diffused out of the char surface into the bulk gas. The uneven distribution of alkali and alkaline earth metals with respect to char particle size is influential in affecting the sulfation extent on the char surface.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0887-0624			WOS:000307494300020

A radial structure model for oxidized PAN fibers (OFs) and carbon fibers (CFs) has been established by Raman spectroscopy and wide angle X-ray diffraction. According to the model, the cross-section of OFs is divided into the internal and external regions; the oxygen-induced modification has a greater effect on the structural evolution of internal regions than that of external regions. When the oxygen volume content for the modification is 22.2%, the OFs possess the highest level value for degree of disorder (DD) in internal regions. This is inherited by the corresponding CFs with the best radial structure homogeneity and optimum mechanical properties; meanwhile, the coefficient of variation for DD is defined to characterize the radial homogeneity of CFs. The mechanism of the oxygen-induced modification demonstrates that the mechanical properties of the resulting CFs depend on the degrees of the intermolecular cyclization and oxidation which are beneficial to the decrease in CF crystallite size.

(TPFC)P-V(OH)(2) displayed excellent HER activity in dimethylformamide (DMF) with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as the proton source, and the turnover frequency (TOF) reached 31.75 s(-1) at an overpotential of 900 mV. Interestingly, the HER electrocatalytic performance remained extraordinary even applying water as a proton source in acetonitrile/water (v/v=2 : 3), with a TOF of 18.40 mol H2 ${{_{{\rm H}{_{2}}}}}$ mol(cat)(-1) h(-1) at an overpotential of 900 mV.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000867352000001	36121337

The microporosity of the composite was largely maintained after Ni impregnation. The composite has a very low Ni loading of 0.7 wt%, combined with an efficient electrocatalytic behavior towards water oxidation, as demonstrated by an onset potential of 1.51 V vs. RHE and a considerably low over-potential of approximate to 0.28 V. Moreover, a low overpotential of 0.4 V at current density of 10 mAcm(-2) was attained, and the composite shows also a high 100 mAcm(-2) current density for the OER at 1.8V vs. RHE. The Tafel slope for the Ni-loaded catalyst (45 mVdecade(-1)) indicates enhanced water oxidation characteristics as a result of the Ni ion loading. The Ni-loaded composite shows excellent durability in the water oxidation reaction, with enhanced performance upon progression of the cycles. This approach demonstrates the feasibility of fine tuning the composite's properties through post-synthetic impregnation with selected metal ions. The pyrimidine-based porous-organic polymer (PyPOP) provides a high surface area support with suitable anchoring sites for the catalytically active Ni ions, with the graphene layers providing the required electrical conductivity to the composite.									16	0	0	0	4	0	16			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000407221200008

Its success requires a drastic improvement in the kinetics of the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, a novel ORR catalyst formed by encapsulating thin Cu layer decorated Co nanoparticles inside graphitic carbon layers that are embedded with abundant Co-N-x and Cu-N-x atomic sites (denoted as SA-CoCu@Cu/CoNP), is reported. The multicomponent SA-CoCu@Cu/CoNP composite exhibits a remarkable ORR catalytic activity, exceptional stability, and excellent methanol tolerance in alkaline media, outperforming the commercial platinum carbon under identical testing conditions and also being active in acidic media. The excellent ORR catalytic performance is ascribed to the modified electronic structure of the Co-N-x active sites due to an electron donating effect from the embedded nanoparticles and the nearby Cu-N-x species, as revealed by X-ray spectroscopic results and density functional theory computations. Moreover, the effective role of Cu-N-x sites in suppressing the peroxide formation during ORR is also identified, endowing the resultant catalyst a prolonged stability and enhanced efficiency that are beneficial for practical applications.									36	1	0	0	1	0	35			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000627071100001

In this work, a facile wet-chemical method is reported to synthesize ultrafine IrxNiy alloy encapsulated in porous N-doped carbon (BMNC) derived from bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). Benefiting from the advantages of alloy effect between Ir and Ni, high surface area and more active site exposing, the optimal sample Ir3Ni2/BMNC with only 7.7 wt% Ir content reveals outstanding OER electrocatalytic activity in alkaline and acidic electrolyte. When evaluated in 1 m KOH, Ir3Ni2/BMNC exhibits low overpotential of 279 mV to drive current density of 10 mA cm(-2) compared with IrO2 (322 mV), 59.4 times Ir mass activity of 303 A g(Ir)(-1) higher than IrO2 (5.1 Ag-Ir(-1)) and prominent durability of 40 000 s for chronopotentiometry test. Assessed in 0.1 m HClO4, Ir3Ni2/BMNC also possesses long stability of 40 000 s for chronopotentiometry, high current density (eta(10) = 321 mV) and 19.9 times Ir mass activity (303 A g(Ir)(-1)) superior to IrO2 of eta(10) = 350 mV and 15.2 A g(Ir)(-1), respectively. The brilliant durability attributes to the structure of alloy nanoparticles anchored in porous N-doped carbon.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2196-7350			WOS:000589514800001

Confined [PtCl6](2-) in IL molecules effectively prevents the growth and spontaneous aggregation of the Pt NPs due to the electrochemical neutrality of the IL, resulting in a homogeneously dispersed state of Pt NPs. The Pt-IL-HCNs with a Pt loading of 22 wt % outperform the commercial Pt/C (40 wt %) in terms of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and durability. The half-wave potential of Pt-IL-HCNs is 51 mV more positive than that of the commercial Pt/C in 0.1 M HClO4. An electrochemical surface area of 97 m(2) mg(-1) Pt and specific mass activity of 475 mA mg(-1) Pt of Pt-IL-HCNS were found to be 5.6 and 2.7 times higher than those on the commercial Pt/C. Furthermore, this work demonstrates that unlike one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanotubes and two-dimensional (2D) reduced oxide graphene, the three-dimensional (3D) HCN support plays an indispensable role in preventing any stacking of Pt NPs, leading to significantly enhanced ORR activity and durability.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2168-0485			WOS:000717346600033

For this purpose, the molecule was irradiated with gamma rays in oxygen-free aqueous solutions, and the thermal decomposition was studied in a static system at temperatures up to 90 degrees C, simulating a white hydrothermal vent. Our results indicate that a succinic acid is a relatively stable compound under irradiation. The gamma radiolysis yields carbon dioxide and di- and tricarboxylic acids such as malonic. carboxysuccinic. and citric acids.

This reaction entails the oxidation of NADH with molecular oxygen as the electron acceptor. Depending upon the experimental conditions, either regular or highly irregular oscillations obtain. Previous work suggests that the latter fluctuations are almost certainly chaotic. In either case, the dynamics contain multiple timescales, which fact results in an uneven distribution of points in the phase space. Such 'non-uniformity,' as it is called, is a rock on which conventional methods for analysing chaotic time series often founder. The results of the present study are as follows. 1. Short-term forecasting with local linear predictors yields results that are consistent with a hypothesis of low-dimensional chaos. 2. Most of the evidence for nonlinear determinism disappears upon the addition of small amounts of observational error. 3. It is essentially impossible to make predictions over time intervals longer than the average period of oscillation for time series subject to continuous and frequent sampling. 4. Far more effective forecasting is possible for points on Poincare sections. 5. An alternative means for improving forecasting efficacy using the continuous data is to include a second variable (NADH concentration) in the analysis. Since non-uniformity is common in biological time series, we conclude that the application of nonlinear forecasting to univariate time series requires care both in implementation and interpretation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1364-503X			WOS:A1994PK96300008

The result shows that the gas evolved from the RuO_2-Ti anode in the NHa-NH_4Cl electrolyte system is neither oxygen nor chlorine and is nitrogen only. The influences of the concentration of each component of the NH_3-NH_4Cl electrolyte system on the anodic polarization and the control step of the anode reaction were studied via cyclic voltammertry. It was found that the concentration of Cl^- has almost no effect on the anodic reaction rate, and the rate of electrochemical reaction on the RuO_2-Ti anode increases with the increase of ammonia concentration in the electrolyte. It was also found that the anodic reaction is a diffusion-controlled reaction, its apparent activation energy is 27.55kJ·mol~(-1), and the exchange current density and the transfer coefficient are 4.36*10~(-6)A·cm~(-2) and 0.117, respectively.			通过研究RuO_2-Ti阳极在不同电解液体系中的极化行为，探讨了RuO_2-Ti阳极在氨．氯化铵体系中析氮反应的机理以及电解液中各组分浓度对阳极电化学行为的影响；并利用循环伏安曲线研究了阳极电化学反应过程的控制步骤。发现在氨-氯化铵电解液体系中RuO_2-Ti阳极的阳极反应析出的气体并不是氧气，也不是氯气，经过对电解液体系组成的分析和化学检验确定RuO_2-Ti阳极电化学反应析出的气体为氮气；在氨．氯化铵电解液体系中RuO_2-Ti阳极电化学反应的控制步骤为扩散控制，电化学反应的表观活化能为27．55kJ·mol~(-1)，交换电流密度和传递系数分别为4．36*10~(-6)A·cm~(-2)和0．117；电解液体系（NH_3-NH_4Cl）中氨浓度的增加可加快RuO_2-Ti阳极表面的电化学反应的速度，而电解液体系中氯离子浓度的增加则对RuO_2-Ti阳极电化学反应速度几乎没有影响。						0	1	0		0	0	1			1003-9015			CSCD:2857357

Herein, we designed highly efficient amorphous FeMn-based electrocatalysts toward oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions (OER/HER) via a simple electrodeposition method using Ni foam (NF) as the support. Nonmetal heteroatoms are introduced to adjust the intrinsic properties through this route without any post-treatment steps. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of Fe and Mn species and nonmetal atoms, in 1.0 M KOH solutions, FeMnOx efficiently drives the OER with an overpotential of 220 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and P-FeMnOx is helpful for both the OER and the HER (251 and 97 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2)) catalysis. Two electrolytic tanks employing P-FeMnOx as a cathode and FeMnOx/P-FeMnOx as anodes show low voltages reaching 50 mA cm(-2) (1.62 and 1.68 V). This work highlights the combination of advantages between nonmetal and different non-noble metal elements in high-performing overall water electrocatalysis.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2168-0485			WOS:000648430000020

Here, in situ confinement of FeNx active sites in high porosity carbon framework (FeNx/CMCC) derived from chelate of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and iron ions were synthesized. Particularly, construction of FeNx within porous carbon framework accelerates the electron transfer and the sufficient utilization of active centers, and then expedites the reaction kinetics of ORR and OER. As expected, the optimized FeNx/CMCC exhibits superior ORR activity with a larger half-wave potential of 0.869 V. The rechargeable Zn-air battery delivers a higher power density of 99.6 mW/cm(2) and a special capacity of 781.9 mA h/gZn at 10 mA/cm(2), together with excellent durability of over 335 h. Remarkably, the as-assembled solid-state battery exhibits a higher open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.5 V, a special capacity of 709.7 mA h/g(Zn), as well as prolonged cycling stability (90 h). Moreover, the flexible solid-state battery displays negligible loss of electrochemical performance under various bending angles, illustrating its potential application in flexible electronic devices.

Herein, the first principle based density functional theory (DFT) computations have been carried out to investigate a series of transition metal-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TM-TCNQ: TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd) monolayer for bi-functional single atom electrocatalyst towards ORR and OER. Amongst various first transition metal row based TCNQ substrates, Cobalt-TCNQ (Co-TCNQ) monolayer was predicted to exhibit best bi-functional catalytic activity. At equilibrium potential (1.23 V, vs RHE), the free energy portraits of Co-TCNQ monolayer for OER in acidic or alkaline media are not completely downhill, measuring an excess potential of 0.6 V, equal to the overpotential, which is needed to be supplied externally to promote the OER activity. On the other hand, an onset potentials of 0.34 V (vs RHE) in acidic media are measured for ORR to proceed. The promising catalytic activity of two dimensional Co-TCNQ monolayer towards ORR and OER as revealed by DFT investigations has been explained in terms of density of states and Bader charge analysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000694716300013

Herein, for the first time, we report pyrite-type iron nickel monophosphosulfide (Ni1-xFexPS, x = 0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2) electrocatalysts with exceptional OER efficiency and stability under alkaline conditions. Ni0.85Fe0.15PS/NF exhibits a considerably low overpotential of 251 (314) mV at 10 (100) mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 34 mV dec(-1), together with remarkable stability. Moderate Fe regulation in NiPS (Ni0.85Fe0.15PS) is found to stimulate the activation of high-valence-state Ni/Fe oxyhydroxides during the irreversible surface reconstructions that form disordered MOOH@MxSOy@MxPOy surfaces under OER conditions, as is established by microstructural observations, surface-sensitive X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. DFT calculations show that the catalytic sites formed by Fe doping are more nucleophilic than the Ni sites and thus more OER active, due to a facile Fe(ii) -> Fe(iii) oxidation state change for Fe. Meanwhile, overly stable OER surface species are not formed, as Fe in oxidation states higher than Fe(iii) is not favorable, which leads to a lower barrier for the rate-limiting OER step than that for the Ni site. The present results shed light on the design and development of high-performance electrocatalysts in ternary metal monophosphosulfides, as well as providing a fundamental understanding of their intrinsic active sites.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000590158400039

Herein, a new highly active ORR electrocatalyst is reported based on graphene layers-wrapped Fe/Fe5C2 nanoparticles supported on N-doped graphene nanosheets (GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG) through simply annealing a mixture of bulk graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and ferrocene. An interesting exfoliation-denitrogen mechanism underlying the conversion of bulk g-C3N4 into N-doped graphene nanosheets is revealed. Owing to the high graphitic degree, optimum N-doping level and sufficient active sites from the graphene layers-wrapped Fe/Fe5C2 nanoparticles, the as-prepared GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG electrocatalyst obtained at 800 degrees C exhibits outstanding ORR activity with a 20 mV more positive half-wave potential than the commercial Pt/C catalyst in 0.1 m KOH solution and a comparable onset potential of 0.98 V. This makes GL-Fe/Fe5C2/NG an outstanding electrocatalyst for ORR in alkaline solution.									165	8	0	0	8	0	166			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000429318400022

The anodic electrodeposited MnO2 layers on the composite anodes were studied and their properties were compared with those of an industrial Pb-Ag anode. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiostatic polarizations were accompanied by chemical analysis of the electrolyte to investigate the Mn(II) oxidation and oxygen evolution rates on the fresh anodes. The long term effect of the deposited MnO2 on the electrocatalytic properties of the anodes was studied by galvanostatic polarizations. The results revealed that the Pb-MnO2 anodes operate at lower potentials than the Pb-Ag anodes in a Mn-free electrolyte, indicating higher electrocatalydc activity of the composite anode. The Mn(II) "oxidation proceeded at different rates on the Pb-Ag and Pb-MnO2 anodes. The oxygen evolution reaction was depolarized in the presence of Mn(II) ions. However, formation of the MnO2 layers might lead to higher anodic potentials. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were utilized to characterize the deposited MnO2 layers and also the corrosion product layers on the anodes. The MnO2 layers on the anodes were found to have different properties. While MnO2 layers on the composite anodes were uniform, compact and adhesive, the deposited layers on the Pb-Ag anodes were flaky, porous, and loosely adhered. These layers provided the anodes with different degree of protection against electrochemical oxidation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

With positive achievements for various applications, SACs blur the line between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis, maximize metal efficiency, and provide ultrahigh activity. However, challenges remain to achieve the scalable production of SACs with atomically dispersed high-density and uniform sites, electronic structures, and fast reaction dynamics. This review summarizes the cutting-edge achievements of SACs for future energy applications. Specifically, we focus on recent efforts to boost the catalytic activity of SACs. Several key directions in creating local active surfaces, synthesis methodology, reaction mechanisms, and surface science from the viewpoint of coordination chemistry are introduced. Finally, we outlook on achieving star SACs up to the level of "precise catalysis" in the future.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000790793800001

Light, incident on a semiconductor electrode, splits water directly. A one-step monolithic system such as this eliminates the need to generate electricity externally and subsequently feed it to an electrolyzer. We report here on our work involving the application of tandem cell technology to photoelectrochemical water splitting. Tandem cell technology connects photovoltaic layers (p-n junctions) with different semiconductor bandgaps in series, one behind the other in a single monolithic device. This configuration provides a greater utilization of the solar spectra giving rise to higher theoretical efficiency, and the monolithic structure minimizes the amount of active area needed. Tandem cells consisting of GalnP(2)/GaAs homojunctions, were studied for the to photoelectrochemical decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen from an aqueous electrolyte solution. To catalyze the water decomposition process, the illuminated surface of the device was modified either by addition of platinum colloids or by coating with ruthenium dioxide. These tandem cells also showed an apparent unusual and unexpected property of both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions occurring simultaneously at the illuminated surface. This has been attributed to an oscillatory chemical reaction initiated by the lack of current matching between the top and bottom cells and the addition ct a Schottky type junction at the semiconductor electrolyte interphase.					11th World Hydrogen Energy Conference (11 WHEC)11th World Hydrogen Energy Conference (11 WHEC)	JUN 23-28, 1996JUN 23-28, 1996	Deut Gesell Chem Apparatewesen Chem Tech & Biotechnol e V; Int Assoc Hydrogen Energy; State Govt Baden Wurttemberg; Lord Mayor City Stuttgart; BASF AG, Ludwigshafen; Bayer Motorenwerke AG, Munchen; Bayernwerk AG, Munchen; Daimler Benz AG, Stuttgart; Deut Lufthansa AG, Frankfurt am Main; Hamburg Elekt Werke AG, Hamburg; Hoechst AG, Frankfurt am Main; Huls AG, Marl; Landesgirokasse LG Stift, Stuttgart; Linde AG, Hollriegelskreuth; Messer Griesheim GmbH, Krefeld; PreussenElektra, Hannover; Robert Bosch GmbH, Stuttgart; US DOE; Tech Werke Stadt Stuttgart AG; Deut Forschungsanstalt Luftfahrt & Raumfahrt e V; Deut Phys Gesell, Arbeitskreis Energie; Energietech Gesell VDE; European Federat Chem Engn; Forum Zukunftsenergien e V; VDI, Gesell Energietech; Zentrum SonnenenergieForschung & WasserstoffForschungDeut Gesell Chem Apparatewesen Chem Tech & Biotechnol e V; Int Assoc Hydrogen Energy; State Govt Baden Wurttemberg; Lord Mayor City Stuttgart; BASF AG, Ludwigshafen; Bayer Motorenwerke AG, Munchen; Bayernwerk AG, Munchen; Daimler Benz AG, Stuttgart; Deut Lufthansa AG, Frankfurt am Main; Hamburg Elekt Werke AG, Hamburg; Hoechst AG, Frankfurt am Main; Huls AG, Marl; Landesgirokasse LG Stift, Stuttgart; Linde AG, Hollriegelskreuth; Messer Griesheim GmbH, Krefeld; PreussenElektra, Hannover; Robert Bosch GmbH, Stuttgart; US DOE; Tech Werke Stadt Stuttgart AG; Deut Forschungsanstalt Luftfahrt & Raumfahrt e V; Deut Phys Gesell, Arbeitskreis Energie; Energietech Gesell VDE; European Federat Chem Engn; Forum Zukunftsenergien e V; VDI, Gesell Energietech; Zentrum SonnenenergieForschung & WasserstoffForschung	STUTTGART, GERMANYSTUTTGART, GERMANY	0	0	0	0	0	0	0						WOS:A1996BG96N00318

The bands of the SERS spectra of the Cu/CuO/Pd electrode observed in the range of E values from +0.3 V to 0 V (standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)) at 1328-1569 cm-1 are consistent with the existence of species that are adsorbed or weakly bound to the surface with the energy of interaction close to 15-21 kJ mol-1. These bands can be attributed to the ad(ab)sorbed (H3O+)ad, (H2+)ab, and (H2+)ad ions as intermediates in reversible hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions (HER/HOR) taking place on the Cu/CuO/Pd electrode. There was no isotopic effect observed; this is consistent with the dipole nature of the electron-ion pair formation of adsorbed (H3O+)ad and (H2+)ad or (D3O+)ad and (D2+)ad. In accordance with the literature data, SERS bands at 125-146 cm-1 and similar to 520-565 cm-1 were assigned to Cu(I) and Cu(II) oxygen species. These findings corroborate the quantitative stepwise mechanism of water reduction.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2076-3417		WOS:000518042000036

Transition-metal sulfides are emerging as alternatives to precious metal-based electrocatalysts, however, their bifunctional activities are usually restricted by inferior electrical conductivities and limited electrochemical active sites. Herein, we highlight a novel metal-organic frameworks derived nitrogen-doped carbon nanofiber coupled FeS2-CoS2 (FeS2-CoS2/NCFs) by a combination of electrospinning and atomic-layer-deposition approach. Benefiting from the large exposed surface active sites of hierarchical structure and the abundant interfacial vacancies in FeS2-CoS2 heterointerface, the FeS2-CoS2/NCFs integrated electrocatalyst delivers a high bifunctional activity together with a good durability in alkaline medium. Notably, the liquid Zn-air battery assembled with this FeS2-CoS2/NCFs electrode displays a considerable peak power density of 257 mW cm(-2), a high specific capacity of 814 mA h g(-1) and a long cycling life of 250 h, superior to precious metal based Zn-air batteries. Moreover, the flexible solid-state Zn-air battery using such FeS2-CoS2/NCFs electrode can stably power LED panels even under twisting state, demonstrating practical potentials in wearable and portable electrochemical devices.									33	1	0	0	1	0	34			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000597247400006

To address this limitation, the gray fries cake-like TiO2 assembly composed of single-crystal TiO2 nanorods by in-situ carbon adherence was fabricated via hydrogenation of protonic titanate nanosheets (PTN) under normal pressure. During the hydrogenation process, the residual butyl alcohol adsorbed on PTN from tetrabutyl titanate hydrolysis can be in-situ converted into carbon in company with the formation of oxygen vacancies (O-vacancies) on TiO2. The carbon layer and O-vacancies are able to induce the growth of single-crystal TiO2 nanorods and their assembly to form the fries cake-like structure. Moreover, the carbon layer can not only offer a favorable reduction environment to generate rich O-vacancies on TiO2, but also efficiently improve these O-vacancies and TiO2 nanorods' stability during catalytic reaction. O-vacancies/carbon layer can serve as electron trap active sites which can capture and transfer electrons to improve the separation of electron-hole pairs. As a consequence, in the absence of any co-catalysts, a high efficiency of hydrogen evolution was achieved for the TiO2 assembly with 69.7 mu mol h(-1) (quantum efficiency similar to 2.3% at 420 nm) under solar light irradiation. After laying six months, our TiO2 assembly still exhibited high photocatalytic performance, which is superior to previous TiO2-based photocatalyst. The results indicate that the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 assembly can be enhanced by stabilizing the surface rich oxygen vacancies with carbon coating.									57	7	0	0	3	0	59			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000428488600001

Cyclic voltammetry and rotating-disk electrode analyses suggest that the Ag50Cu50 electrocatalyst is 2.5times more catalytically active in the ORR than a pure Ag catalyst and catalyzes the ORR through a four-electron pathway. Field-emission TEM characterization shows that the surface-roughened Ag-Cu electrocatalyst comprises small nanoplatelets with diameters of 40-50nm. Cu atoms are partially alloyed in Ag lattices in these nanoplatelets. The Ag-Cu electrocatalysts are assembled into the primary and secondary zinc-air batteries as carbon-free and binder-free catalyst layers. The open circuit voltage and the discharge voltage of the primary zinc-air battery at 20mAcm(-2) are 1.49 and 1.17V, respectively. The round-trip efficiency and increased polarization of the rechargeable zinc-air battery are 56.4 and 0.2%, respectively, after 100cycles at 20mAcm(-2). The Ag-Cu electrocatalyst shows good catalytic activity in the oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline battery and good tolerance of carbonate ions on the cathode side.									48	0	0	0	2	0	48			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000359066500015

Transition-metal-based catalysts with superb activity and stability are highly considered as an alternative of the present noble-metal-based electrocatalysts. Herein, we reported a simple construction of Mn-doped Co-N-C (Mn/Co-N-C) as an excellent bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalyst. It is found that the enhanced ORR/OER electrocatalytic activity benefits by suitably doping Mn, which affects the electronic structure of the Co species. The optimized Mn/Co-N-C exhibits excellent ORR/OER performance with a potential difference of 0.86 V, which outperforms a commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst (0.93 V). Rechargeable liquid zinc-air batteries based on the Mn/Co-N-C bifunctional catalyst exhibit initial discharge and charge potentials at 1.20 and 2.02 V (5 mA cm(-2)), along with an outstanding stability with negligible increase in polarization even after 250 h. Furthermore, the all-solid-state zinc air batteries fabricated with the Mn/Co-N-C bifunctional catalyst also display an outstanding lifetime with 60 cycles (2 mA cm(-2)) and steady charge/discharge potential even upon bending.									59	4	0	0	1	0	60			2168-0485			WOS:000482173100058

In this work, we reported a comprehensive study on synthesis of GO with different sp(2)/sp(3) ratios at different oxidation reaction temperatures. The physicochemical properties of the as-prepared GO were characterized by Attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR), Raman spectroscopy, Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR), Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Transmission electron microscope (TEM), hydrophilicity test and zeta potential. Interestingly, GO-35 showed the smallest contact angle with carbon-to-oxygen (O/C) ratio 0.469. ATR-IR reveals the different intensity of hydroxyl (-OH), carbonyl (-C=O), epoxy (C-O-C), as well as carboxyl (-COOH) moieties in the GO samples, and their intermolecular interactions significantly affected the interlayer spacing between consecutive identical planes of carbon atoms which examined using XRD. XPS confirmed that the basal species such as -OH is abundantly available in the GO-35 and unavailable in GO-50. Our results demonstrate that the properties of GO can be tuned using different oxidation reaction temperatures, which significantly influences types of oxygen-functional groups generated at different oxidation levels, thus could pave the way for various applications of graphene-based material.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000764111200006

Doped carbon-based materials offer a viable means for replacing Pt, but their activity improvement still remains a great challenge. Here, configurations of N-doped carbons are first analyzed using ab initio simulations toward ORR. The results show that a certain short-range ordered structure labeled as C-N2, which comprises of two nitrogen atoms flanking carbon, is the optimal choice. The predicted configuration of C-N2 is experimentally realized by triazine-doped carbon (triNC). The triNC with C-N2 sites demonstrates high ORR activity (onset potential 0.98 V, halfwave potential 0.89 V) comparable to commercial 20% Pt/C. The highly localized and positive-charged carbon atom in the C-N2 structure facilitates the dissociation of O-2 to increase the ORR kinetics, proved by theoretical calculation. A Zn-air cathode is fabricated using the triNC ORR electrocatalyst and outperforms the cathode using Pt/C in terms of specific capacity, energy density and long-term durability. The atomic-scale approach reported here provides a good strategy to achieve active carbon-based electrocatalysts for potential and scalable use in energy conversion and storage.									13	2	0	0	0	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900032

Herein, a cage-confinement pyrolysis route is proposed to realize size-controllable synthesis of molybdenum-based catalysts ranging from isolated single Mo atoms to sub-nanometer clusters (<1 nm) and nanoparticles (2-5 nm). The effective control in the degree of dispersion facilitates a rational investigation into the electrocatalytic behavior of metal species from the angstrom to the nanometer scales. Notably, the Mo single atom catalysts show superior activity for bifunctional oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) with a smaller potential gap of 0.65V, which are compared favorably with the analogous sub-nanometer clusters and nanometer-level particles. X-ray fine structure analyses coupled with theoretical calculations demonstrate that the active Mo sites in the Mo1N1C2 local coordination environment have promoted the reversible oxygen electrode reactions. As a demonstration of their real application potentials, the zinc-air batteries assembled by using the highly active Mo single atom catalysts as the air cathode deliver a specific capacity of 750 mA h g(Zn)(-1) with an energy density of 673 W h kg(Zn)(-1), comparable to a mixed Pt/C-RuO2 benchmark.									71	1	0	0	3	0	71			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000504828100016

However, they are not well structured for high-performing bifunctionalities, largely due to the confined single particle morphologies, where the exposed surfaces and interfaces are limited. Herein, a hollow nanoframing strategy is purposely devised for interconnected Co3O4-Mo2N heterostructures that are designed with interfacial charge transfer from Mo2N to Co3O4, as rationalized by theoretical calculations and confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. It is shown that by the controllable pyrolysis of bimetallic Mo-Co Prussian blue analogue nanoframes (NFs) with an optimal Mo/Co ratio, the desired nanoframes of Co3O4-Mo2N heterostructure are successfully formed. The as-synthesized Co3O4-Mo2N NFs not only inherit the functionalities of individual components and the electrolyte-accessible nanoframe structure, and they also give an ideal heterointerface with strong electron interaction and favorable H2O/H* adsorption energies, leading to a remarkable enhancement in bifunctional catalytic activities (i.e., 12.9-fold and 20-fold higher current density under the 300 mV overpotential, as compared to the single-phased Co3O4 NFs alone toward HER and OER, respectively), while remaining a robust stability.									44	1	0	0	3	0	45			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000714561100001

For containers made from oxygen-free, phosphorus-doped copper, the most likely corrosion processes are uniform corrosion, underdeposit corrosion, stress corrosion cracking, and microbiologically influenced corrosion. The environmental conditions within the repository are expected to evolve with time, changing from warm and oxidizing initially to cool and anoxic in the long-term. In response, the corrosion behaviour of the containers will also change with time as the repository environment evolve. A reactive-transport model has been developed to predict the time-dependent uniform corrosion behaviour of the container. The model is based on an experimentally-based reaction scheme that accounts for the various chemical, microbiological, electrochemical, precipitation/dissolution, adsorption/desorption, redox, and mass-transport processes at the container surface and in the compacted bentonite-based sealing materials within the repository. Coupling of the electrochemical interfacial reactions with processes in the bentonite buffer material allows the effect of the evolution of the repository environment on the corrosion behaviour of the container to be taken into account. The Copper Corrosion Model for Uniform Corrosion predicts the time-dependent corrosion rate and corrosion potential of the container, as well as the evolution of the near-field environment.

Even the expensive RuO2 or IrO2, the most acid-resistant oxides, can be dissolved at an oxidative potential. Herein, we realize that the failures of OER catalysts are mostly caused by the weak interface between catalysts and the substrates. Hence, the study of the interface structure between catalysts and substrates is critical. In this work, we observe that the cheap OER catalysts Co3O4 can be more durable than the state-of-the-art RuO2 if the interface quality is good enough. The Co3O4 nanosheets deposited on carbon paper (Co3O4/CP) is prepared by electroplating of Co-species and followed by a two-step calcination process. The 1st step occurs in vacuum in order to maintain the surface integrity of the carbon paper and converts Co-species to Co(II)O. The 2nd step is a calcination in ambient conditions which enables the complete transformation of Co(II)O to Co3O4 without degrading the mechanical strength of the Co3O4-CP interface. Equally important, an in situ formation of a layer of amorphous carbon on top of Co3O4 further enhances the OER catalyst stability. Therefore, these key advances make the Co3O4 catalyst highly active toward the OER in 0.5 M H2SO4 with a small overpotential (370 mV), to reach 10 mA/cm(2). The observed long lifetime for 86.8 h at a constant current density of 100 mA/cm(2), is among the best of the reported in literature so far, even longer than the state-of-art Ruv on CP. Overall, our study provides a new insight and methodology for the construction of a high-performance and high stability OER electrocatalysts in corrosive acidic environments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Accelerated thermal ageing experiments were carried out on the oilpaper samples at 120degC and 130degC, respectively. The degree of polymerization, furfural content, and carbon and oxygen gas content were measured at different ageing periods, and their changing laws were explored. According to the change trend of the crystallinity of insulating paper in the test, a reasonable inference was made about the change of its refractive index, and further analysis was carried out by the Abbe refractometer. On the basis of dispersion staining color method, the evolution rule of refractive index of the oil-paper cellulose fiber during thermal ageing was explored. The results show that as the ageing progresses, the degree of polymerization decreases, while the furfural content and the carbon oxygen gas content increase, the refractive index and crystallinity of the insulating paper increases, and the refractive index of the oil-paper cellulose fiber increases also. The refractive index of cellulose can be considered as a new type of ageing characteristic of insulating paper.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1009-9239			INSPEC:21199796

However, the optimum dual-doping is still not clear due to the lack of strong experimental proofs, which rely on a reliable method to prepare carbon materials that can rule out the interference factors and then emphasize only the doping effects. In this work, an inside-out doping method is reported to prepare carbon submicrotubes (CSTs) as a material to study the principles of designing dual-doping catalysts for ORR. The interference factors including the metal impurities and doping gradient in the bulk phase are excluded, and the doping effects including the structural and chemical variation of carbon are studied. P-doping exhibited a higher pore-forming ability to perforate carbon and a lower doping content, but a higher ORR catalytic activity as compared with S- and B-doped N-CSTs, demonstrating the N,P co-doping is more efficient in making carbon-based catalysts for ORR. First-principle calculations reveal that the edge C situated around the oxidized P site nearby a graphitic N atom is the active site that shows the lowest ORR overpotential comparable to Pt-based catalysts. This study suggests that the catalytic activity of dual-heteroatoms-doped carbons not only depends on the intrinsic chemical bonding between heteroatoms and carbon, but also is affected by the structural variation generated by introducing different atoms, which can be extended to the study of other kinds of functionalization of carbon and potential reactions besides ORR.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000648268500001		
J	Zhexu Xi								Nanostructures Design: the Role of Cocatalysts for Hydrogen and Oxygen Generation in Photocatalytic Water Splitting [arXiv]								arXiv								13 pp.	13 pp.						14 March 2021	2021	Due to the energy supply pressure caused by non-renewable fuels as well as the environment-related issues, the efficient conversion of solar-chemical energy via photo-induced water splitting is one of the promising strategies to address the existing problems. To strengthen the overall catalytic performance of photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) evolution, the selection and construction of cocatalysts are crucial. Recently, the semiconductor photocatalysts have been well modified with the loaded cocatalysts as the active sites by extending the light harvest, promoting the electron separation and transfer, and improving the photocatalytic activity. Combined with the principles of photocatalysis, the paper focuses on the mechanism and roles of cocatalysts for boosted photocatalytic water splitting in recent research. The categories with the corresponding research contents of the existing cocatalysts are also summarised, including cocatalysts for H2 evolution, cocatalysts for O2 evolution, and dual cocatalysts for overall water splitting. Finally, the future direction of the development is suggested for the rational design and large-scale application of highly efficient cocatalysts in the photo-induced water splitting system.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0						INSPEC:20735454

New experimental data confirming an attribution of the absorption bands at 910, 976 and 1105 cm(-1) to the VO3 complex are obtained. In particular, a correlated generation of VO3 and the oxygen trimer is observed upon irradiation of CzSi crystals in the temperature range 300-400 degrees C. Strong evidence for the assignment of the bands at 991 and 1014 cm(-1) to a VO4 defect is presented. The lines are found to develop very efficiently in the VO2 containing materials enriched with the oxygen dimer. In such materials the formation of VO4 is enhanced due to occurrence of the reaction O-2i+VO2 double right arrow VO4. Annealing of the VO3 and VO4 defects at T >= 550C degrees C is found to result in the appearance of new defects giving rise to a number of O-related LVM bands in the range 990-1110 cm(-1). These bands are suggested to axise from VO5 and/or VO6 defects. Similar bands also appear upon the annihilation of oxygen-related thermal double donors at 650 degrees C in Cz-Si crystals pre-annealed at 450 degrees C.					11th International Autumn Meeting on Gettering and Defect Engineering in Semiconductor Technology (GADEST 2005)11th International Autumn Meeting on Gettering and Defect Engineering in Semiconductor Technology (GADEST 2005)	SEP 25-30, 2005SEP 25-30, 2005	TECSEN; CEMES CNRS; LMPTECSEN; CEMES CNRS; LMP	Giens, FRANCEGiens, FRANCE	35	0	2	0	0	0	37			1012-0394		3-908451-13-2	WOS:000234198300042		
J	Yoon, SC; Langer, N; Scheithauer, S				Langer, Norbert/ABD-7263-2021				Effects of rotation on the helium burning shell source in accreting white dwarfs								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				425	1			217	228		10.1051/0004-6361:20040327				OCT 2004	2004	We investigate the effects of rotation on the behavior of the helium-burning shell source in accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, in the context of the single degenerate Chandrasekhar mass progenitor scenario for type la supernovae (SNe Ia). We model the evolution of helium-accreting white dwarfs of initially 1 M-circle dot, assuming four different constant accretion rates (2, 3, 5 and 10 x 10(-7) M-circle dot/yr). In a one-dimensional approximation, we compute the mass accretion and subsequent nuclear fusion of helium into carbon and oxygen, as well as angular momentum accretion, angular momentum transport inside the white dwarf, and rotationally induced chemical mixing. Our models show two major effects of rotation: a) The helium-burning nuclear shell source in the rotating models is much more stable than in corresponding non-rotating models - which increases the likelihood that accreting white dwarfs reach the stage of central carbon ignition. This effect is mainly due to rotationally induced mixing at the CO/He interface which widens the shell source, and due to the centrifugal force lowering the density and degeneracy at the shell source location. b) The C/O-ratio in the layers which experience helium shell burning - which may affect the energy of an SN Ia explosion - is strongly decreased by the rotationally induced mixing of a-particles into the carbon-rich layers. We discuss implications of our results for the evolution of SNe la progenitors.									54	4	0	0	0	0	54			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000224734400026

Alfa) seedlings were studied.It was shown that thylakoids isolated from plants previously subjected to a prolonged NaCl treatment were more resistant to high concentration of NaCl after in vitro incubation. Pretreatment with ABA 3 clays before salinization diminished the inhibitory effect of the NaCl. Both ABA and NaCl treatment lead to an increase in the internal ABA level in the plant leaves. ABA seems to play a specific role in this adaptive process, promoting some structural changes in the chloroplast membranes, which in turn reflect on the oxygen evolving mechanisms. The obtained results are discussed in terms of an effect of salinity and ABA treatment leading to an increased participation of the stroma situated photosystem PI centers, possessing higher resistance to damaging factors.									25	22	0	0	33	0	49			0176-1617			WOS:A1993MM41700020

Herein, we report the design of a new Ru-based bifunctional catalyst characterized with rich atomic interfaces through the in-situ growth of sub-lam RuOx clusters on the surface of porous Co3O4 nanosheets with 4.1 wt% Ru loaded. Such unique architecture ensures the creation of high-energy interfacial Ru-O-Co bond that allows fine tuning of the electronic structure of both Ru and Co. The as-prepared catalyst exhibits superior oxygen electrocatalysis bifunctionality, indicated by an ultralow potential gap of 0.71 V between the potential of OER at 10 mA cm(-2) (1.51 V) and the half-wave potential for ORR (0.80 V). Remarkably, rechargeable ZAB with such electrocatalyst demonstrates not only high rate performance (50 mA cm(-2)) and power density (150 mW cm(-2)), but also superior round-trip efficiency (68.4%, after 250 h). X-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopy reveal that the active sites for ORR/OER are mainly the unsaturated trivalence Ru in RuOx clusters, and the formed interfacial Ru-O-Co bond can avoid the dissolution of RuOx in alkaline electrolyte, holding great potential in implementation of long-life rechargeable ZABs.									51	2	0	0	0	0	50			2405-8297			WOS:000577179100003		
J	Lei, Zheng; Su Mingyu; Xiao, Wu; Chao, Liu; Qu Chunxiang; Liang, Chen; Hao, Huang; Liu Xiaoqing; Hong Fashui								Antioxidant stress is promoted by nano-anatase in spinach chloroplasts under UV-B radiation								BIOLOGICAL TRACE ELEMENT RESEARCH				121	1			69	79		10.1007/s12011-007-8028-0				JAN 2008	2008	A proven photocatalyst, titanium dioxide in the form of nano-anatase, is capable of undergoing electron transfer reactions under light. In previous studies, we had proven that nano-anatase could absorb ultraviolet light (UV-B) and convert light energy to stable chemistry energy finally via electron transport in spinach chloroplasts.The mechanisms by which nano-anatase promotes antioxidant stress in spinach chloroplasts under UV-B radiation are still not clearly understood. In the present paper, we investigate the effects of nano-anatase on the antioxidant stress in spinach chloroplasts under UV-B radiation. The results showed that nano-anatase treatment could significantly decrease accumulation of superoxide radicals O-2(.-), hydrogen peoxide (H2O2), and malonyldialdehyde (MDA) content, and increase activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), and elevate evolution oxygen rate in spinach chloroplasts under UV-B radiation. Together, nano-anatase could decrease the oxidative stress to spinach chloroplast caused by UV-B radiation.									165	3	3	0	115	2	174			0163-4984	1559-0720		WOS:000252252200010	18186002

Metal chalcogenide, carbide, and pnictide materials have been investigated recently, but there is some controversy regarding the composition of the actual electrocatalytic material. Carbides, in particular, have not been heavily studied as OER catalysts, and their catalytic nature is still an open question. In an effort to contribute to the clarification of the catalytic particle composition during OER, we have thoroughly characterized the elemental composition of the cobalt carbide particles at various times during OER testing and found that the particles are first converted to a transitory core-shell structure (Co3C core-amorphous Co oxide shell) followed by the gradual but complete conversion to an amorphous Co oxide particle during additional electrochemical OER testing. This amorphous Co oxide particle (derived from Co3C) maintains the shape of the original parent Co3C particle and exhibits a high electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). Moreover, the amorphous Co oxide particle derived from Co3C shows a higher geometric OER activity than either commercial Co oxide particles or Co3C-CoOx core shell particles. We also observe that the fully oxidized Co3C shows the same intrinsic activity as commercial Co oxide particles when normalized by the ECSA. Accordingly, the amorphous Co oxide particles produced from Co3C possesses a porous nanostructure capable of electrocatalytically oxidizing water within the internal pores of the particles.									51	2	0	0	2	0	51			2574-0962			WOS:000458706600006		
J	Hao, LM; Liang, HG; Wang, ZL; Liu, XM								Effects of water stress and rewatering on turnover and gene expression of photosystem II reaction center polypeptide D1 in Zea mays								AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				26	4			375	378		10.1071/PP98104				1999	1999	Photosystem II oxygen evolution capacity, the steady-state level of photosystem II (PSII) reaction center polypeptide D1 and its transcript and template levels in Zea mays L. (Xinyu No. 4) under water stress and rewatering were studied. The results indicated that PSII and whole-chain electron transport capacities decreased slightly under moderate water stress and appreciably under severe water stress, and could not recover to control level upon rewatering. The results of western and northern blots showed that the content of PSII reaction center polypeptide D1 changed as a similar pattern to PSII and whole-chain electron transport capacities. Dot blot analysis for DNA showed that there was no obvious response of the template level of D1 to water stress or rewatering. From the results, it was concluded that PSII was the major site affected by water stress, where the functional loss of PSII could be attributed to the reduction of PSII reaction center polypeptide D1, which may be caused by the decrease in its transcript level. Rewatering could only ameliorate slightly under moderate water stress but could not recover to control level under severe water stress.									10	6	0	0	10	2	18			0310-7841			WOS:000081698800009

The Co3O4 depositing layer is composed of Co3O4 nanoflakes, forming a uniform flower-like porous structure. The Co3O4 nanoflakes within the depositing layer provide a large amount of catalytic active sites for oxygen evolution and reduction reactions. The three-dimensional porous network of the Co3O4 depositing layer can not only facilitate the transportation of ions and electrolyte within the electrode, but also provide plenty of space to accommodate Li2O2 species formed during the discharge process. The Co3O4 spheres embedded in the TiO2 fiber mesh, formed by the treatment of a suspension of cobaltammine precipitate, function as anchors to prevent the detachment of the Co3O4 layer from the current collector, resulting in excellent structural and cycling stability. Only a slight specific capacity decay is observed at full discharge/charge after 80 cycles. This work demonstrates the important factors in the preparation of binder-free cathodes for high performance lithium-oxygen batteries.									30	4	0	0	1	0	31			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000353643300037	25854214

The avoidance of direct contact between methane and steam and/or gaseous oxygen has the potential to eliminate the energy consumption for generating these oxidants, thereby increasing methane conversion efficiency. This article investigates redox catalysts comprised of iron oxide core covered with lanthanum strontium ferrite (LSF) shell. The iron oxide core serves as the primary source of lattice-oxygen, whereas the LSF shell provides an active surface and facilitates O2- and electron conductions. These core shell materials have the promise to provide higher selectivity for methane conversion with lower solid circulation rates than traditional redox catalysts. Methane oxidation by this catalyst exhibits four distinct regions, i.e. deep oxidation; competing deep and selective oxidation; selective oxidation with autoactivation; and methane decomposition. Further investigations indicate that the evolution of "loose" lattice oxygen from the bulk contributes to deep oxidation, whereas reduced surface iron species are responsible for selective methane oxidation.									124	7	0	0	7	0	127			2155-5435			WOS:000345735200026

The preparation process study shows that the beta-PbO2 bath containing Co3O4 particles becomes more stable for an ultrasonic dispersion time within 30 min, with the stability beginning to decrease after the ultrasonic time exceeds 30 min. Co3O4 particles in the beta-PbO2 bath are positively charged, with anions being adsorbed onto the particles. The nucleation behavior study shows that the electric field force plays a dominant role in the adsorption process for the Co3O4 particles. The nucleation and growth of beta-PbO2 on the Co3O4 particles started for the particles closer to the substrate. In addition, the thickness of the beta-PbO2 layer on the Co3O4 particles was inversely proportional to the distance between the Co3O4 particles and the substrate. Compared to the pure PbO2 electrode, the oxygen evolution overpotentials for the beta-PbO2-Co3O4 electrode are decreased significantly, which demonstrates an energy-saving effect.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			2523-3963	2523-3971		WOS:000473560100024		
J	Wang, Haijuan; Viswanathan, Nurni N.; Ballal, N. B.; Seetharaman, Seshadri								Modelling of Physico-Chemical Phenomena between Gas inside a Bubble and Liquid Metal during Injection of Oxidant Gas								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL REACTOR ENGINEERING				8						A33					2010	2010	Gas liquid reactors are extensively used in many metallurgical processes involving the refining of liquid metals. In these processes, reactions leading to the oxidation of various solutes in liquid metal often compete with each other, which ultimately determine the liquid metal composition. In the present paper, a model has been proposed to simulate the evolution of solute contents in a metallic melt considering mass transfer of solutes in the melt in the vicinity of the bubble, equilibrium at the gas-metal interface and gas composition evolution in the bubble during its ascent through the melt. The composition of solutes at the metal-gas interface in principle can be altered by changing the injected gas composition.The model was applied to the case of oxygen injection through a lance into liquid steel-containing C and Cr, aiming sufficient decarburization without much oxidation of Cr to the slag. The Cr loss to the slag by oxidation is generally much more than that expected based on equilibrium thermodynamics applied to the bulk metal and gas. The actual Cr loss, as shown by the present model, is determined by the composition of solutes at the metal-gas interface rather than in the bulk. The effect of change of the partial pressure of oxygen in the bubble by replacing oxygen by carbon dioxide in the injected gas and the corresponding evolution of C and Cr contents in the melt was simulated. Some preliminary experiments were conducted to validate the model predictions. The frame work of the model is generic and can be extended to many gas-liquid metal reactors in liquid metal processing.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1542-6580			WOS:000274473700005

The results showed that Cu-0/activated carbon has a highest H2S breakthrough capacity of 358.3 mg/g under co-presence of steam and oxygen, followed by Cu+ and Cu2+ loaded activated carbon. The H2S removal process consists of catalytic oxidation and reactive adsorption, resulting in the formation of large amount of elemental sulfur and part of sulfate and sulfide. The presence of steam or oxygen mainly enhances the catalytic oxidation of H2S to form elemental sulfur, and the breakthrough sulfur capacity decreases in the order of moist oxygen, moist nitrogen, dry oxygen and dry nitrogen conditions. The evolution of desulfurization product at different reaction times indicate that the sulfate and sulfide are mainly generated at prometaphase stage of desulfurization, while the elemental sulfur could be formed in the whole stage. These findings provide a new route to prepare in-expensive and high efficient copper-based H2S adsorbent from high moisture organic waste.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000783310600007

Measurements show that OH is efficiently produced even in the absence of water vapour in the mixture, and that the radical production is closely linked to the degradation kinetic of the hydrocarbon. Experimental results for dry mixtures, both for OH and for the removal of ethane in the discharge volume, are compared with predictions of a self-consistent 0D discharge and the kinetic model. It appears that the oxidation reaction of the ethane molecule by O(P-3) atoms plays a minor role. Dissociation of the hydrocarbon through quenching collisions of the nitrogen metastable states are of great importance for a low oxygen concentration value. Also, the oxidation of ethane by O(D-1) cannot be neglected at high oxygen concentration. The most probable exit channel for N-2 states quenching collisions by ethane is the production of ethene and hydrogen molecules. Afterwards C2H4 should be dissociated to produce H and H-2. As previously suggested from the study of the OH density time evolution in relative value, the recombination of H and O atoms appears as a main process for the production of OH in transient low temperature plasmas generated in atmospheric gases at high pressure. Another important reaction is the reduction of the HO2 radical by O, this radical coming from the addition of H on the oxygen molecule. H atoms come from numerous kinetic processes, amongst which is the dissociation of ethene.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000268553600018

In this study, high-activity water oxidation is shown over noble-metal-free, bimetallic nickel vanadium oxide (NiVOx) thin-film electrocatalysts developed over three-dimensional nickel foam (NF) via the single-step aerosol-assisted chemical vapor (AACVD) technique under controlled conditions. Distinct morphological transformations from a micro-nano to a nanoscale catalytic structure are observed by simply increasing the deposition time from 60 to 180 min. The catalyst prepared for 180 min (NiVOx/NF180) initiates the OER at a mere potential of 1.42 V vs RHE and exhibits current decade at 1.44 V vs RHE, peak current density >1200 mA/cm2 at just 1.64 V vs RHE, a low Tafel slope of 60 mV/dec, and remarkable stability during a prolonged period of water oxidation catalysis. The catalytic activity is comparable to and even better than state-of-the-art Ru-based catalysts investigated in alkaline conditions. The high activity can be ascribed to the subtly modulated local coordination environment and electronic structure of the Ni/V compound in the nanotextured catalyst. This work provides a competent, efficient, and high-efficiency anodic oxygen evolution and chemical energy conversion catalyst that is easily accessible via a straightforward AACVD route while employing simple precursors.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2574-0962			WOS:000812962900001

To improve it, a systematic understanding of the underlying photocatalytic mechanisms is desirable but difficult to obtain by experimental techniques alone. Here, we have investigated the oxidation of water on the most stable terminations of the bare hematite, as well as in the presence of a monolayer of Ga2O similar to(3), by first-principles density functional theory-based methods. Although several surface terminations are very close in surface energy, they all yield a very similar overpotential of similar to 0.8 V on the bare surface and similar to 0.95 V on the Ga2O3-covered surface. Moreover, on all the relevant terminations, the overpotential-determining reaction step is the same, involving the dehydrogenation of a surface-adsorbed hydroxyl species. The reaction mechanism is largely independent of the atomistic details of the surface termination and crucially involves the formation of reaction intermediates involving lattice oxygen bound to adsorbed oxygen from water (O*-O-s). It seems likely not only that different surface terminations coexist but also that they transform into one another during reaction conditions, even at the steady state. We also shed light on the important role of midgap states of hematite in the water oxidation cycle. In presence of the O*-O-S, species, midgap states that localize on this species can act as long-lived hole traps and fall prey to parasitic recombination processes. Without the O*-O-S, species, the surface states of hematite compete with the states on the active water oxidation species to attract the holes. The Ga2O3 layer passivates these competing surface states, making holes available at the active sites for water oxidation. Though Ga2O3-covered hematite has an overpotential higher than that of bare hematite, it nevertheless plays a very important role in making the holes available at the active site.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000395726500036

Tests were performed in a bubbling reactor, allowing the calculation of the actual rate of O-2 evolution as a function of time from raw data (oxygen flow, concentration of dissolved oxygen, DO) through a model able to take into account mass transfer phenomena Hernandez et al. [19]. A few parameters are proposed for measuring activity, and comparison among them is made. The activity per unit mass of commercial samples is Mn2O3 > MnO2 > Mn3O4, in agreement with the literature. Increase in the surface area brought about by milling correspond, as expected, to a steady increase in activity in the case of Mn3O4, whereas had no effect with Mn2O3. The markedly higher specific surface of Mn2O3 and Mn2O4 samples obtained by thermal treatment of MnO2 and a home-made sample, respectively, correspond surprisingly to activities lower than low surface area ball milled samples. Reasons for this are proposed to be a different nature of the surfaces arrived at, because of the different preparation route. A similar study of the effect of surface area for MnO2 specimens is prevented by their largely amorphous nature. Comparison of present data with those already reported gives further support to the bounty of the model taking into account mass transfer. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we report that tuning the composition of the electrolyte can be used as a strategy to suppress photocorrosion during solar water splitting. Anodic photocorrosion of BiVO4 photoanodes involves the loss of V5+ from the BiVO4 lattice by dissolution. We demonstrate that the use of a V5+-saturated electrolyte, which inhibits the photooxidation-coupled dissolution of BiVO4, can serve as a simple yet effective method to suppress anodic photocorrosion of BiVO4. The V5+ species in the solution can also incorporate into the FeOOH/NiOOH oxygen-evolution catalyst layer present on the BiVO4 surface during water oxidation, further enhancing water-oxidation kinetics. The effect of the V5+ species in the electrolyte on both the long-term photostability of BiVO4 and the performance of the FeOOH/NiOOH oxygen-evolution catalyst layer is systematically elucidated.									341	14	0	0	23	0	343			2058-7546			WOS:000419976100014

The feeding ratios of the Pd/Au precursors, the concentration of ATCA and the presence of ascorbic acid (AA) have great effects on the PdAu nanostructures. The as-prepared PdAu NDs exhibited dramatically enhanced catalytic properties towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under the alkaline conditions, showing the more positive half-wave potential (0.890 V) relative to commercial Pd black (0.808 V), coupled with the 8.3-fold enlargement in mass activity (MA).

The inverse opal structure provides an ideal architecture for storing the discharge product and transporting Li+ and oxygen. The direct current flow through the framework of the inverse opal structure, which does not contain any binder or conductive additives, decreases the electrode's electrical resistance and eliminates side effects associated with binder decomposition. The inverse opal structure made of N-doped carbon increases the catalytic activity by lowering the overpotential for the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. A Li-O-2 battery fabricated using cPDA-IO as the cathode exhibits remarkably enhanced performance, such as a high specific capacity of 43 908 mAh g(cPDA-IO)(-1) with a reversibility of 99.5% as well as stable cycling performance for up to 91 cycles under the harsh conditions of 500 mA g(carbon)(-1), and a curtaining capacity of 1000 mAh g(carbon)(-1). Its good electrochemical performance can be attributed to the synergistic effects of the inverse opal structure, binder-free structure, and N-doped carbon.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2574-0962			WOS:000500038900012

In this context, air cathode porosity plays a key role in battery performance, influencing oxygen supply and hence oxygen reduction and evolution reaction kinetics (ORR/OER). Graphene-based aerogels offer great versatility as air-cathodes due to their low density, high electronic conductivity and adjustable porosity. Reduced graphene aerogels with different porosities are examined where high meso-macroporosity and a narrow macropore size arrangement exhibit the best electrode performance among all studied materials (6.61 mA h cm(-2)). This is ascribed to the particular macroporous 3D structure of graphene-based electrodes, which favours the diffusion of oxygen to the defect sites in graphene sheets. An outstanding cycle life is achieved by using the pore-tuned cathode, leading to 39 cycles (486 h) at 0.5 mA h cm(-2) with very low overpotential (250 mV) and efficiency over 95%. The cyclability is further increased to 745 h (128 cycles) by decreasing the capacity cut-off. This study shows that tuning of material porosity opens a new avenue of research for achieving Na-O-2 batteries with high performance by maximizing the effective area of the electrodes for the ORR/OER.									27	2	0	0	1	0	26			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000451600200020

Mn-Co-Fe-N/S@CNT has higher electrocatalytic activity than the commercial catalysts of Pt/C and RuO2, demonstrating that the half-wave potential of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of Mn-Co-Fe-N/S@CNT is 0.807 V (0.9 V with Pt/C), the initial potential is 0.85 V (0.789 V with Pt/C), the limiting current is 5.66 mA cm(-2) at 0.2 V (5.69 mA cm(-2) with Pt/C), and oxygen evolution reaction overpotential of Mn-Co-Fe-N/S@CNT is 0.386 V at 10 mA cm(-2) (0.371 V with RuO2). Moreover, a rechargeable zinc-air battery using Mn-Co-Fe-N/S@CNT outputs a discharging voltage of 1.2 V and a stable cycle life of over 150 h at 10 mA cm(-2).									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000719101700001

Here, we discuss the emerging principles in small molecule damage biology. We propose that plants evolved at least three distinct systems to control small molecule damage: (i) repair, which returns a damaged molecule to its original state; (ii) scavenging, which converts reactive molecules to harmless products; and (iii) steering, in which the possible formation of a damaged molecule is suppressed. We illustrate the concept of small molecule damage control in plants by describing specific examples for each of these three categories. We highlight interesting insights that we expect future research will provide on those systems, and we discuss promising strategies to discover new small molecule damage-control systems in plants.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			1559-2316	1559-2324		WOS:000442016000016	29944438

In this work, we reported that an iron-cobalt oxide with 2D well-aligned nanoflakes assembling on carbon cloth (Fe-Co3O4 NS/CC), fabricated by an anion-exchange reaction followed by an annealing process, could serve as a high-performance oxygen- evolving catalyst. Specifically, the zeolitic imidazolate frame-work-L-Co nanosheet array (ZIF-L-Co NS/CC) was synthesized through a facile ambient liquid-phase deposition reaction, and then reacted with [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) ions as precursors during the anion-exchange reaction at room temperature. Finally, the Fe-Co3O4 NS/CC was obtained via annealing treatment. On account of the compositional and structural superiority, this 3D monolithic anode exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 290 mV to obtain a geometrical current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and good durability for water oxidation in base.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000467351100095	31009205

The nanoshape of MoO3 has strikingly been changed from nanocubes to nanopaticles dependig on HCl concentration. The MoO3 electrodes of different morphologies are systematically characterized by various characterization techniques for confirming phase, structure, and surface elementals. The electrochemical studies exhibit significant enhancement in specific capacitance and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity for MoO3 nanorod-based electrode. The specific capacitance of 2561.53 F g(-1) for MoO3 nanorods is much higher than 608.20 F g(-1) and 400.28 F g(-1) for nanocubes and nanoparticles, respectively. Besides, with the 98.59% capacitance retention up to 2000 cycles, the electrode consisting nanorods is found to be highly stable. In the commercial point of view, the as-fabricated MoO3//MoO3 symmetric device adduces excellent energy/power density (69.06 Wh kg(-1)/1336.63 W Kg(-1)) at current density of 1 A g(-1). The laboratory panel, Center for Nanomaterials & Energy Devices, containing nearly 42 LEDs has been ignited with full intensity using MoO3//MoO3 symmetric device as the practical demonstration of electrode material. From supercapacitor study, the MoO3 nanorod-based electrode endows excellent OER activity (overpotential of 246 mV; Tafel slope of 36 mV dec(-1)). In both cases, the MoO3 nanorod-based electrode produces excellent chemical and cyclic stability. Overall electrochemical results demonstrate that the MoO3 nanorod-based electrode would be excellent electrode material for supercapacitor as well as OER applications. The proposed room-temperature solution synthesis process is valuable and well effective in view of trouble-free, cost-effective, and scalability for commercial benefits.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000784280800004

The code is designed to treat the three-dimensional inhomogeneity with a reasonable accuracy in a realistic configuration of the reactor within an acceptable computational time using common computer resources. The profiles of electromagnetic wave fields and the temporal evolution of plasma parameters and radical densities in a bounded, inhomogeneous, cylindrical system have been calculated.

Herein, CoFe alloyed nanocrystals embedded in N-doped bamboo-like carbon nanotubes (CoFe@NCNTs) were facilely synthetized by one-step co-pyrolysis with the mixture of triamterene, metal chlorides and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4). The resultant CoFe@NCNTs exhibited excellent ORR activity with the positive shifts in the onset potential (E-onset = 0.97 V) and half-wave potential (E-1/2 = 0.88 V), outperforming commercial Pt/C (E-onset = 0.96 V; E-1/2 = 0.84 V). Compared to metal organic frameworks (MOFs)-based strategy for synthesis of low-cost carbon-based ORR catalysts, this method is simple and convenient, coupled by avoiding the complicated synthesis of MOFs and its ligands. This work provides a promising route to fabricate advanced transition-metal-based carbon catalysts in the researches correlated with energy conversion devices. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

These G/FePt NPs were a more active and durable catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in 0.1 M HClO4 than the same NPs or commercial Pt NPs deposited on conventional carbon support. The G/FePt NPs annealed at 100 degrees C for 1 h under Ar + 5% H-2 exhibited specific ORR activities of 1.6 mA/cm(2) at 0.512 V and 0.616 mA/cm(2) at 0.557 V (vs Ag/AgCl). As a comparison, the commercial Pt NPs (2-3 nm) had specific activities of 0.271 and 0.07 mA/cm(2) at the same potentials. The G/FePt NPs were also much more stable in the ORR condition and showed nearly no activity change after 10 000 potential sweeps. The work demonstrates that G is indeed a promising support to improve NP activity and durability for practical catalytic applications.									580	31	0	0	39	0	590			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000300460600012	22279956

This treatment turned AISI 304 steel into an efficient electrocatalyst for water splitting at pH 7 and pH 13. The overpotential of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which typically limits the efficiency of the overall water-splitting process, could be reduced to 260 mV at 1.5 mA/cm(2) in 0.1 M KOH. At pH 7, overpotentials of 500-550 mV at current densities of 0.65 mA/cm2 were achieved. These values represent a surprisingly good activity taking into account the simplicity of the procedure and the fact that the starting material is virtually omnipresent. Surface-oxidized AISI 304 steel exhibited outstanding long-term stability of its electro catalytic properties in the alkaline as well as in the neutral regime, which did not deteriorate even after chronopoteniometry for 150 000 s. XPS analysis revealed that surface oxidation resulted in the formation of Fe oxide and Cr oxide surface layers with a thickness in the range of a few nanometers accompanied by enrichment of Cr in the surface layer. Depending on the duration of the Cl-2 treatment, the purity of the Fe oxide/Cr oxide mixture lies between 95% and 98%. Surface oxidation of AISI 304 steel by chlorination is an easy and scalable access to nontoxic, cheap, stable, and efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting.									117	3	0	0	8	0	117			2155-5435			WOS:000352464400073

It is found that the adsorption sites of O-2 are the Ta-Ta bridge sites on both the partially covered TaC (1 0 0) surfaces by Pd and Pt, M-4/TaC (1 0 0) (M = Pd and Pt), while the 4-fold metal hollow sites and the metal-metal bridge sites are preferred on the fully covered TaC (1 0 0) surfaces by Pd and Pt monolayer, M-ML/TaC (1 0 0), respectively. The deposition of Pd or Pt can enhance the oxidation resistance of TaC (1 0 0). Meanwhile, the TaC (1 0 0) decorated by monolayer Pd still exhibited outstanding catalytic activity for O-2 dissociation. Our study might be useful to designing efficient catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, a multi-dimensional hierarchical strategy is proposed to design melamine sponge-derived sulfur and nitrogen co-doped tetrapod carbon (SNTC) supported cobalt-nickel telluride (CoTe2/SNTC, NiTe2/SNTC, and CoNiTe2/SNTC) 1D/3D and 0D/3D nanohybrids for boosting hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and triiodide reduction reaction (IRR). Among these, the CoNiTe2/SNTC 0D/3D hybrid exhibited superior catalytic activities and excellent electrochemical stability. In alkaline HER, the CoNiTe2/SNTC catalyst had a low Tafel slope of 72 mV dec(-1), which was comparable to that of Pt/C (49 mV dec(-1)). CoNiTe2/SNTC served as counter electrode catalyst in photovoltaics and obtained a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.11%, which is higher than that of Pt (7.25%). This investigation provides a novel approach for designing highly efficient nanohybrid catalysts in advanced energy devices. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

In this work, a novel sandwich-like heterostructured nanocomposite was facilely constructed via incorporation of Co9S8 nanoclusters/Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) nanocubes in N,S-doped carbon multilayers (Co9S8/Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)/N,S-CMLs) by a one-pot coordination-modulated pyrolysis of a mixture containing dicyandiamide, Co(NO3)(2 a)nd Evans blue at 800 & DEG;C. The control tests demonstrated critical roles of the pyrolysis temperature played on the final morphology and shape, and discussed the formation mechanism in detail. The as-prepared catalyst exhibited appealing electrocatalytic performance for ORR with a more positive onset potential (E-onset = 0.96 V vs. RHE) and half-wave potential (E-1/2 = 0.87 V vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, far outperforming other home-made catalysts and commercial Pt/C.

In this work, we test CoFePB as a non-noble-metal formate oxidation catalyst in a liquid fuel cell, with formate acting as a carbon-based, water soluble, hydrogen carrier. Herein we fabricate two proof-of-concept aqueous direct formate fuel cells. One uses CoFePB as a formic acid oxidation catalyst coupled with Pt as an oxygen reduction reaction catalyst and delivers a maximum power density of 67 mu W cm(-2). The second one, based on carbon felt as a cathode and Ce4+ as a terminal electron acceptor, shows a stable maximum power output of 8.6 mW cm(-2).

During the spraying, the binder metal is melted and a small portion of WC is decomposed to W2C. A porous coating is formed by evolution of carbon oxide gases formed by the reaction of the free carbon and the sprayed oxygen gas. The laser heat treatment eliminates the porosity and provides a more densified microstructure. After laser heat treatment, the porosity in the coating layer decreases from 1.7 % to 1.2 and the coating thickness decreases from 150 pm to 100 pm. The surface hardness increases from 1440 Hv to 1117 Hv. In the wear test, the friction coefficient of coating decreases from 0.45 to 0.32 and the wear resistance is improved by the laser heat treatment. The improvement is likely due to the formation of oxide tribofilms.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1225-0562	2287-7258		WOS:000460325700009

Herein, we rationally designed a CoP/NC (CoP nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen and carbon matrices) nanocube catalysts via a pyrolysis phosphidation strategy derived from Co-Co/PB (Co-Co prussian blue) MOF-based precursor, which was employed as a robust heterogeneous catalyst for photocatalytic water oxidation for the first time. The TEM and SEM tests exhibit that Co-Co/PB contributes to well-defined nanocube architecture features after phosphidation. Furthermore, the photocatalytic performance of CoP/NC nanocube catalyst was examined in photocatalytic water oxidation system using [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) as photosensitizer and S2O82- as sacrificial electron acceptor. The result shows CoP/NC has a modest high O-2 evolution rate of 901.5 mmol h(-1) g(-1), O-2 yield of 36.1%, TOF of 34.5 x 10(-3) mol(O2) mol(metal)(-1) s(-1), and quantum yield of 61.5%. Noteworthily, an amorphous CoOx layer on CoP/NC surface was observed by HRTEM test after light reaction. The amorphous CoOx layer and CoP form a core-shell structure (CoP@CoOx), which facilitates the electron transport effectively. Additionally, the CoP/NC nanocube catalyst shows good electrocatalytic oxygen evolution performance, which has a higher current density and smaller Tafel slope than CoS2/NC and Co3O4/NC derived from the same precursor of Co-Co/PB with CoP/NC. This strategy of using prussian blue analogue as template to create metal phosphide will provide a platform for exploring highly efficient and stable catalysts for energy conversion reactions.

In this study, we report that nickel phosphide nanoflake arrays on carbon cloth (Ni2P NF/CC) behave as a highly-active durable 3D catalyst electrode for the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with the required potential of 0.447 V to achieve a geometrical catalytic current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in a 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea. Remarkably, the high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of Ni2P NF/CC enables it to be a bifunctional catalyst for both the UOR and HER towards energy-saving electrochemical hydrogen production, and its two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer requires a cell voltage of only 1.35 V to attain 50 mA cm(-2), which is 0.58 V less compared with that required for pure water splitting to achieve the same current density, with remarkable long-term electrochemical durability and nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency for hydrogen evolution.									227	8	0	0	13	0	227			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000395077600017

This study designs a rational catalyst/cocatalyst by constructing the readily available OH- adsorption sites to boost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Cobalt selenide-coated nickel selenide nanorods are in situ grown on nickel foam to obtain CoSe/NiSe-nrs/NF via a one-pot solvothermal synthesis route. CoSe-0.2/NiSe-nrs/NF (Co/Ni molar ratio of 0.26) exhibits an excellent OER activity(an overpotential of 310 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 58.3 mV dec(-1)). The differently oriented CoSe/NiSe-nrs with a velutipes-like structure and metallic property provide a promising electrical conductivity for charge transfer. In situ X-ray diffraction tests verify the crystallization of active beta-NiOOH during OER, and the crystallized NiOOH/CoOOH contributes to the excellent OER cycling stability in alkaline media. Synergistic effects between CoSe and NiSe-nrs/NF can balance the formation of NiOOH/CoOOH heterostructures to govern the exposure of available active sites. NiOOH/CoOOH as a highly active component can energetically adsorb OH- to promote OER. CoSe/NiSe-nrs/NFs as a low Pt-loading (0.5 wt%) support offer the mutually beneficial interactions for promoting cocatalytic and COads (poisonous intermediate) co-oxidation activities toward MOR. The electrochemically active surface area and mass activity of Pt/CoSe-0.2/NiSe-nrs/NF are 85 m(2) g(pt)(-1) and 1437.1 mA mgpt-1, respectively, which are much higher than those of commercial Pt/C (10.0 wt%). OH- absorbed on the NiOOH/CoOOH structure eliminates COads on the Pt surface via bifunctional mechanisms to improve the MOR activity. This study provides a promising reference for designing the versatile catalysts for energy conversion.									43	4	0	0	3	0	44			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000507146100064	31825209

Developing low-cost, high performance and stable electrocatalysts is critical for the extensive implementation of these technologies. Herein, we present a procedure to prepare colloidal chromium phosphide CrP nanocrystals and we test their performance as ORR electrocatalyst. CrP-based catalysts exhibited remarkable activities with a limiting current density of 4.94 mA cm(-2) at 0.2 V, a half-potential of 0.65 V and an onset potential of 0.8 V at 1600 rpm, which are comparable to commercial Pt/C. Advantageously, CrP-based catalysts displayed much higher stabilities and higher tolerances to methanol in alkaline solution. Using density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate CrP to provide a very strong chemisorption of O(2 )that facilitates its reduction and explains the excellent ORR performance experimentally demonstrated.									14	2	0	0	2	0	14			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000483451200060

In this work, we report the results of theoretical investigations of the relative stability of layered and spinel bulk phases of Co oxides, as well as the stability of selected surfaces as a function of applied potential and pH. We then study the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on these surfaces and obtain activity trends at experimentally relevant electro-chemical conditions. Our calculated volume Pourbaix diagram shows that beta-CoOOH is the active phase where the OER occurs in alkaline media. We calculate relative surface stabilities and adsorbate coverages of the most stable low-index surfaces of beta-CoOOH: (0001), (01 (1) over bar2), and (10 (1) over bar4). We find that at low applied potentials, the (10 (1) over bar4) surface is the most stable, while the (01 (1) over bar2) surface is the more stable at higher potentials. Next, we compare the theoretical overpotentials for all three surfaces and find that the (10 (1) over bar4) surface is the most active one as characterized by an overpotential of eta = 0.48 V. The high activity of the (10 (1) over bar4) surface can be attributed to the observation that the resting state of Co in the active site is Co3+ during the OER, whereas Co is in the Co4+ state in the less active surfaces. Lastly, we demonstrate that the overpotential of the (10 (1) over bar4) surface can be lowered further by surface substitution of Co by Ni. This finding could explain the experimentally observed enhancement in the OER activity of NiyCo1-yOx thin films with increasing Ni content. All energetics in this work were obtained from density functional theory using the Hubbard-U correction.									851	35	0	0	56	0	858			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000330163200050	23944254

Herein, the structural evolution of low-dimensional oxidized indium catalysts and the impact of surface oxygen vacancies on the catalytic efficiency were investigated. We first utilizein situenvironmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) to monitor the transformation of two-dimensional InOOH nanosheets into oxygen-vacancy-rich (V-o-rich) InOOH nanosheets and then three-dimensional In(2)O(3)nanoparticles under heat treatment. Three typical samples collected from the same process were subsequently applied as electrocatalysts for the CO(2)reduction reaction (CO2RR). Benefiting from the abundant oxygen defects, a faradaic efficiency of 93.5% toward formate at moderate overpotentials (-0.9 Vvs.RHE) with a partial current density over 14 mA cm(-2)was obtained over V-o-rich InOOH nanosheets. This research provides a strategy to design a highly efficient system for the CO2RR and sheds new light on the structure-activity relationship of low-dimensional oxidized metal catalysts.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2398-4902			WOS:000544657200049

Cobalt and carbon were deposited in the presence of N-2 gas using a pulsed laser deposition method and then the metal Co was removed by HCl-washing treatment. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity was electrochemically determined using a rotating disk electrode system in which the film samples on the GC substrate were replaceable. The ORR activity increased with the temperature of the GC substrate during deposition. A carbon-based film prepared at 600 degrees C in the presence of N-2 at 66.7 Pa showed the highest ORR activity among the tested samples (0.66V vs. NHE). This film was composed of amorphous carbons doped with pyridine type nitrogen atoms on its surface. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

For a new application and modelling, we first refined the crystal structure of potassium poly(heptazine imide) (K-PHI)-a benchmark carbon nitride material in photocatalysis-by means of X-ray powder diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Using the crystal structure of K-PHI, periodic DFT calculations were performed to calculate the density-of-states (DOS) and localize intra band states (IBS). IBS were found to be responsible for the enhanced K-PHI absorption in the near IR region, to serve as electron traps, and to be useful in energy transfer reactions. Once excited with visible light, carbon nitrides, in addition to the direct recombination, can also undergo singlet-triplet intersystem crossing. We utilized the K-PHI centered triplet excited states to trigger a cascade of energy transfer reactions and, in turn, to sensitize, for example, singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) as a starting point to synthesis up to 25 different N-rich heterocycles.									43	2	0	0	6	0	43			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000539015400001	32412175

The evolution of stoichiometry and types of defects was illuminated by slow positron implantation spectroscopy (SPIS). A turning point of T-f=1750 degrees C was found that at this point the crystallinity and stoichiometry natures were the best. In order to develop the chemical phase from substoichiometric to stoichiometric, the oxygen gas concentration in the mixture gas during deposition should be raised to an appropriate level.					9th International Workshop on Positron and Positronium Chemistry9th International Workshop on Positron and Positronium Chemistry	MAY 11-15, 2008MAY 11-15, 2008	Hubei Provincial Govt; Chinese Nucl Phys Soc; Natl Nat Sci Fdn China; Adv Measurement Technol IncHubei Provincial Govt; Chinese Nucl Phys Soc; Natl Nat Sci Fdn China; Adv Measurement Technol Inc	Wuhan Univ, Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINAWuhan Univ, Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0255-5476		*****************	WOS:000264749800055

The high tensile strength was achieved by decreasing silicon particles which were internal defects of the oxynitride glass. The glass of 3 mm thick had transmittance of more than 90%. The silicon particles were generated in the glass by decomposition of SiO2 above 1720 degrees C under strong reducing conditions, which caused coloration of the glass and low fiber strength. Refining of the glass at 1600 degrees C decreased the silicon particles. The reaction between =Si-N=, =Si-O- in the glass matrix and molybdenum formed molybdenum silicides with the evolution of nitrogen and oxygen gases. Silicon particles were oxidized by oxygen evolved.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0022-3093			WOS:A1997WF09600006

Herein, we report a bimetallic metal-organic frameworks based strategy to fabricate Ru-based electrocatalysts with high exposure of the Ru active sites (Ru-HPC, ruthenium-decorated hierarchically porous carbon) for high efficient hydrogen evolution. Remarkably, Ru-HPC achieves a current density of 25 mA cm(geo)(-2) at an overpotential of 22.7 mV, and shows an ultrahigh turnover frequency of 1.79 H-2 s(-1) at 25 mV, which is almost twice higher than that of commercial Pt/C. The electrochemical HER performance of Ru-HPC surpasses most of the electrocatalysts reported so far in alkaline solutions. Besides, a two-electrode water splitting device is constructed with Ru-HPC and porous RuO2 (obtained by oxidizing Ru-HPC) as electrode materials, which achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at only 1.53 V. This work provides a facile strategy to fabricate high-performance metal-carbon hybrid electrocatalysts with abundant exposed active sites from bimetallic MOFs, which can hopefully be applied to many other metals-carbon hybrids for various electrochemical applications in the foreseeable future.									123	4	0	0	3	0	123			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000461433600001

Among a diverse selection of catalysts, platinum (Pt) is attracting attention as it possesses superior catalytic activity in both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in comparison to other catalysts. Catalytic activity is influenced by various factors related to catalytic active sites, such as the surface area and grain size. Until now, the morphology of Pt catalysts has been limited to spherical shapes; studies on various other morphologies of these catalysts have proven insufficient. In this work, highly monodisperse platinum hole-cylinder nanoparticles (Pt-HCNPs) with a small grain size of 5 nm were fabricated using a top-down method. The Pt-HCNPs were composited with graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) to achieve a significantly reduced overpotential of 0.41 V and a high energy efficiency of 90%. During discharge, amorphous Li2O2 with a nanoflake morphology that facilitates formation and decomposition was found. This unique Li2O2 formation process is suggested to be a cause of the reduction mechanism that occurs via numerous catalytic active sites provided by the hole-cylinder morphology and small grain size of this catalyst. These findings suggest a strategy for fabricating catalysts for high-performance Li-O-2 batteries through a top-down method known as secondary sputtering lithography.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000636714000053

A large body of recent research has demonstrated attractive activity of Fe-N macrocycle complexes as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media. To be a substitute for Pt in APFCs, however, most of the macrocycle molecules remain largely unsatisfactory in both of the catalytic activity and durability. Herein, we show that a one-pot microwave conjugation results in a polymerized ironphthalocyanine (pFePc) which exhibits extremely high ORR performance, showing activity much better than that of the FePc monomer and 20 wt % Pt/C, and similar to that of the 60 wt % Pt/C under the same catalyst loading. Furthermore, we proposed an edge-closing strategy to significantly enhance the stability of the pFePc catalyst in alkaline media by eliminating the edge anhydride groups. Using the edge-closed pFePc as the cathode catalyst in APFC, a power density as high as 452 mW.cm(-2) is non-noble metal catalyst-based APFCs so far reported.									21	0	0	0	1	0	20			1944-8244			WOS:000443654600044	30079727

The influence of a series of perovskites with different e(g) filling on the kinetics of Li2O2 oxidation was examined using Li2O2-prefilled electrodes. While LaCrO3 is inactive for oxygen evolution upon water oxidation in alkaline solution, it was found to provide the highest specific current towards Li2O2 oxidation among all the perovskites examined. Further exploration of Cr-based catalysts showed that Cr nanoparticles (Cr NP) with an average particle size of 40 nm, having oxidized surfaces, had comparable surface area activities to LaCrO3 but much greater mass activities. Unlike Pt/C and Ru/C that promote electrolyte oxidation in addition to Li2O2 oxidation, no evidence of enhanced electrolyte oxidation was found for Cr NP relative to Vulcan carbon. X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the O K and Cr L edge revealed a redox process of Cr3+ <-> Cr6+ on the surface of Cr NP upon Li2O2 oxidation, which might be responsible for the enhanced oxidation kinetics of Li2O2 and the reduced charging voltages of Li-O-2 batteries.									45	1	0	0	4	0	46			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000329926700014	24352578

Similarly, for artificial photosynthesis where the end product is a solar fuel such as hydrogen, a water splitting-oxygen evolving system is required to supply high energy electrons to drive the reductive reactions. Very attractive candidates for this purpose are iron based semiconductors which have band gaps corresponding to visible light and valence band energies sufficient to oxidise water. The most studied system is hematite (Fe2O3) which is highly abundant with many attributes for incorporation into photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells. We review the recent progress in manipulating hematite for this purpose through nanostructuring, doping and surface modifications. We also consider several hybrid iron-based semiconducting systems like ferrites and iron titanates as alternatives to hematite for light driven water splitting emphasizing their advantages with respect to their band levels and charge transport properties.									102	0	0	0	7	0	103			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000337122000004	24469680

To overcome these inherent drawbacks, various methods have been adopted, especially loading oxygen evolution catalysts and depositing oxide passivation layers. We report here an efficient way to promote the photocurrent of Fe2O3 photoanodes via depositing a thin layer of Co0.84Ni0.16-Pi. With the Co0.84Ni0.16-Pi deposit on its surface, the photocurrent density of Fe2O3 increases by ca. 42% at 0.23 V vs. Ag/AgCI, and the onset potential shifts 200 mV cathodically. In contrast, Co-Pi@Fe2O3 photoanode shows only 20% enhancement in photocurrent density under otherwise identical condition. The dark current densities of the photoanodes give an evidence that both Co0.84Ni0.16-Pi and Co-Pi are good oxygen evolution catalysts. Moreover, different from sparsely distributed Co-Pi nanoparticles, a 2-3 nm amorphous Ni doped cobalt phosphate layer can be also an effective passivation layer for surface states of hematite, which has been demonstrated by the analyses of Mott-Schottky plots and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. This work demonstrates the dual roles of an amorphous oxygen evolution co-catalyst on hematite photoanodes and provides a simple method for designing highly efficient photoanodes.

The process occurs without addition of exogenous donors and does not depend on DCMU. Dichlorophenolindophenol and ascorbate do not stimulate the absorption. The blue colour of reduced methylviologen was not observed even after argon had been bubbled through a cuvette with the reaction mixture. Cell decoloration and lysis were found upon long contact with methylviologen. Elevated concentrations of DCMU also caused oxygen absorption in the light. Apparently, it is possible to induce oxidation of endogenous donors in the cells of the above cyanobacteria in the presence of methyl-viologen.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0026-3656			MEDLINE:6774211	6774211

Herein, we propose a scalable approach of in-situ engineering highly exposed Fe-N4/Cx sites on the N,S-doped porous carbon nanofiber membrane as a binder-free air electrode catalyst for ZABs. ZnS nanospheres are firstly used as integrated structure-directing agents to facilitate the elec-tronic modulation of Fe-N4/Cx sites by S doping and construct the hierarchical macro/meso/micropores at high temperature. Neither additional step for removal of ZnS nanospheres nor doping process is required, significantly simplifying the pore formation process and improving the S doping efficiency. Benefiting from the enhanced intrinsic activity of high-density Fe-N4/Cx sites (23.53 lmol g-1) and the optimized mass transport of carbon nanofibers, as-synthesized electrocatalyst shows a positive half-wave potential of 0.89 V for oxygen reduction reaction and a small overpotential of 0.47 V at 10 mA cm-2 for oxygen evolution reaction. When used as the air cathode catalyst for ZABs, it delivers a high specific capacity of 699 mAh g-1 at 5 mA cm-2, a large peak power density of 228 mW cm-2 and a prolonged cycling over 1000 h. At 10 mA cm-2, a robust structure with atomically dispersed Fe is also remained after cycling for 420 h. Due to the flexible properties of the electrocatalyst, as-assembled quasi-solid-state ZAB shows stable cycling over 90 h at alternately flat/bent states, demonstrating great prospects in flexible electronic device applications.(c) 2022 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Unfortunately, it suffers from a low conduction band position compared to the H+/H-2 potential and typically an external bias has to be applied. Here, we demonstrate carbon dot-hematite (CD-Fe2O3) nanocomposites as photocatalysts for visible-light-driven overall water splitting without any external bias or scavenger. Notably, the CD-Fe2O3 nanocomposites (carbon dots, 5 wt%) show a hydrogen evolution rate of 0.390 mu mol h(-1) and an oxygen evolution rate of 0.225 mu mol h(-1) under visible light illumination. In our system, carbon dots have been well coupled with hematite and are detected to generate a photo-induced potential. This photo-potential can be combined with hematite to meet the requirement for overall water splitting. In addition, carbon dots can significantly improve the charge separation efficiency. Our finding may greatly enhance the practical application of hematite for solar water splitting.									35	3	0	0	5	0	36			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000424075400034	29336462

Cu and Al minor components influence the ZnO films' topography and their thermally induced chemical and structural evolution. As prepared (room temperature) films have the structure of layered basic zinc acetate, a lamellar ZnO precursor. Upon annealing at temperatures through 973 K, the films display similar chemical evolution patterns-temperatures above 773 K are needed to completely desorb solvents and decompose precursors. Cu facilitates c-axis orientation of the film as its structure matures, while Al slows its crystallization. Chemiresistive sensors, fabricated by coating thin film functional layers onto interdigitated electrode (IDE) transducers, were evaluated for their responses to oxygen at operating temperatures through 873 K. A ZnO/IDE sensor displays high sensitivity for O-2 at an intermediate temperature, 673 K, reflecting an optimal balance between surface O-2 coverage and carrier availability. At 1:10 mol/mol Cu:Zn and Al:Zn, the developing ZnO structure cannot accommodate all minor component atoms. Surplus atoms accumulate in independent phases at grain boundaries, contributing to both high base resistances (in N-2) and low sensitivity to oxygen. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

One of the most important class of industrial devices is represented by the so-called DSAs, which consist of an electrocatalytic oxide film (usually based on RuO2 and/or IrO2) deposited on a suitable metal support (titanium). To increase the stability of the material, other oxides (TiO2, SnO2, etc.) are added to the electrocatalytic one, with the double purpose of increasing the corrosion resistance of the coating and of diluting the main oxide (to minimize the production costs). In this work, mixtures of 35 mol% IrO2 - 65 mol% TiO2 deposited on titanium supports have been studied by ex-situ (RBS, XRD, ERDA, AFM) and on-site (CV) techniques. Electrodes prepared by an updated sol-gel method and reactive sputtering, at two different temperatures (350 and 450 degrees C), were investigated with the aim of correlating structural information with electrochemical performances, in terms of number of active electrocatalytic iridium sites. Based on roughness indexes, morphological properties, and of data obtained by nuclear methods for surface analysis and cyclic voltammetry, the behavior of iridium sites has been discussed, attempting a qualitative distinction of roles of roughness and intrinsic catalytic activity in a model-electrochemical reaction, like oxygen evolution reaction. Sputtered samples appear, in general, more compact than sol-gel ones, and a low temperature of pyrolysis favours a more extended electroactive surface. The study of OER demonstrates that the kinetics of gas evolution proceeds via the electrochemical oxide formation pathway (Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism) on all samples.

Thus, the implementation of atomic Pt catalysts holds promise for minimizing the Pt content. In this contribution, atomic Pt sites with nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) co-coordination on a carbon matrix (PtNPC) are conceptually predicted and experimentally developed to alter the d-band center of Pt, thereby promoting the intrinsic ORR activity. PtNPC with a record-low Pt content (approximate to 0.026 wt %) consequently shows a benchmark-comparable activity for ORR with an onset of 1.0 V-RHE and half-wave potential of 0.85 V-RHE. It also features a high stability in 15 000-cycle tests and a superior turnover frequency of 6.80 s(-1) at 0.9 V-RHE. Damjanovic kinetics analysis reveals a tuned ORR kinetics of PtNPC from a mixed 2/4-electron to a predominately 4-electron route. It is discovered that coordinated P species significantly shifts d-band center of Pt atoms, accounting for the exceptional performance of PtNPC.									32	2	0	0	1	0	33			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000690482400001	34309153

The influence of oxygen partial pressure in the sputtering plasma on the composition, surface structure and morphology of the films has been studied by XRD, SEM and AFM analysis. An optimal combination of sputtering parameters yields stable microporous amorphous films with highly extended fractal surface. The electrochemical properties of these films have been investigated in view of their application as catalysts for water splitting, using the electrochemical techniques of cyclovoltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and steady state polarization. The SIROFs have shown an excellent electrochemical reversibility and a high catalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction in 0.5 M H2SO4. A current density of 150 mA cm(-2) at potential of 1.7 V (versus Ag/AgCl) has been obtained at catalyst load of only 100 mu g cm(-2). These results combined with the established long-term mechanical stability of the sputtered iridium oxide films (SIROFs) proved the advantages of the reactive magnetron sputtering as simple and reliable method for preparation of catalysts with precisely controlled composition, loading, and surface characteristics.

Here, we report the Pd@PdFe core-shell icosahedra as an active and durable electrocatalyst toward ORR in alkaline conditions, which feature a three-atomic-layer tensile-strained PdFe overlayer on Pd icosahedra. Our optimized catalyst shows 2.8-fold enhancement in mass activity and 6.9-fold enhancement in specific activity than commercial Pt/C catalyst toward ORR, representing one of the best non-Pt electrocatalysts. Moreover, the boosted ORR catalysis is strongly supported by the assembled fuel cell performance using Pd@PdFe core-shell icosahedra as the cathode electrocatalyst. The density functional theory calculations reveal that the synergistic coupling of tensile strain and alloy effects enables the optimum binding strength for intermediates, thus causing the maximum activity. The present work suggests the coupling between multiple surface modulations endows larger room for the rational design of remarkable catalysts.									55	2	0	0	1	0	56			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000514255400073	31967840

This self-limited growth regime is identified by direct imaging of adlayer graphene evolution using in-situ environmental scanning electron microscopy. Two fundamentally different mechanisms for adlayer nucleation are revealed. Besides primary nucleation, which is the standard nucleation that occurs only at the onset of growth, a secondary nucleation of adlayers is observed near full coverage of the substrate. Direct observation reveals layer-dependent growth kinetics and the establishment of a dynamic equilibrium between the forward reaction of carbon incorporation and the reverse reaction of graphene etching. Increasing coverage of the active catalyst gives rise to a spontaneous reversal of adlayer evolution from growth to etching. The growth reversal has important practical benefits. It creates a self-limited growth regime in which all adlayer graphene is removed and it enables large-scale production of 100% single-layer graphene.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2196-7350			WOS:000439739000008

Herein, the Fe(3)O(4)nanoparticles inside N-doped hollow mesoporous carbon spheres (N/HCSs) yolk-shell structure (Fe-x@N/HCSs) is constructed as an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst for ORR and OER via an innovative approach. The N/HCSs effectively control and confine in situ growth of Fe(3)O(4)nanoparticles using the melting-diffusion strategy via capillary force and significantly improve the conductivity and structural stability of the hybrid material. The constructed yolk-shell structured Fe-20@N/HCSs ecosystem with Fe-N(x)active sites exhibits excellent ORR and OER activity and stability, which even surpass commercial grade Pt/C, RuO2, IrO(2)and many reported catalysts.

When combined with the recent appearance of crystal structures from at least two representatives from each of these groups (nine from the monofunctional catalases), valuable insights into the catalatic reaction mechanism in its various forms and into catalase evolution have been gained. The structures have revealed an unusually large number of modifications unique to catalases, a result of interacting with reactive oxygen species. Biochemical and physiological characterization of catalases from many different organisms has revealed a surprisingly wide range of catalatic efficiencies, despite similar sequences. Catalase gene expression in micro-organisms generally is controlled either by sensors of reactive oxygen species or by growth phase regulons, although the detailed mechanisms vary considerably.									1025	31	4	0	764	3	1078			1420-682X	1420-9071		WOS:000188428300007	14745498

We present in this study that by using electrical decoupling, H-2 can be produced spontaneously from wastewater. A power management system (PMS) circuit was deployed to decouple bioanode organic oxidation from abiotic cathode proton reduction in the same electrolyte. The special PMS consisted of a boost converter and an electromagnetic transformer, which harvested energy from the anode followed by voltage magnification from 0.35 V to 2.2-2.5 V, enabling in situ H-2 evolution for over 96 h without consuming any external energy. This proof-of-concept demonstrated a cathode faradaic efficiency of 91.3% and a maximum overall H-2 conversion efficiency of 28.9%. This approach allows true self-sustaining wastewater to H-2 evolution, and the system performance can be improved via the PMS and reactor optimization.									14	1	0	0	3	0	15			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000517122800021

The close proximity of this state to the triple-alpha threshold is needed for the production of carbon, oxygen, and other elements necessary for life. We investigate whether this life-essential condition is robust or delicately fine-tuned by measuring its dependence on the fundamental constants of nature, specifically the light quark mass and the strength of the electromagnetic interaction. We show that there exist strong correlations between the alpha-particle binding energy and the various energies relevant to the triple-alpha process. We derive limits on the variation of these fundamental parameters from the requirement that sufficient amounts of carbon and oxygen be generated in stars. We also discuss the implications of our results for an anthropic view of the Universe.

However, the wide bandgap (E-g = 3.2 eV) and high recombination rate of photogenerated charges hinder their practical application. Herein, a novel hollow urchin-like black RuO2/TiO2/Pt photocatalyst with surface Ti3+ and bulk single-electron oxygen vacancies (Vo center dot) due to self-doping is reported for visible-light photocatalytic activity. Space-separated dual cocatalysts (RuO2 and Pt NPs) with redox capability can greatly improve the separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes of TiO2. Furthermore, constructing surface Ti3+ and bulk Vo center dot in TiO2 is considered an efficient approach for narrowing bandgap and enhancing the visible-light absorption. In particular, the surface Ti3+ promotes a self-hydrogenated shell to reduce the activation barrier of H-2, which enhances the hydrogen evolution. However, excessive bulk Vo center dot as carrier recombination centers are not conducive to the hydrogen production. Positron annihilation lifetime spectra (PALS) indicated that the concentration ratio of surface Ti3+ and bulk Vo center dot is a key factor for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The synergy between the spatially separated dual cocatalysts and optimum surface Ti3+/bulk Vo center dot ratio greatly increases the activity of the catalyst under visible light.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000596714600013

USE - An electrode composition for an electrolyzer, particularly for anode for an oxygen evolution reaction (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The uniformity of the acicular particles provides uniformity in properties, and performance, of articles containing the acicular particles, including optical, electrical, and magnetic properties. The ionomer can be used in the electrode composition without reducing high current operation. The use of dispersed acicular particles in the anode of an electrolyzer causes the current density at a particular voltage to increase monotonically as the catalytic material thickness on the microstructured core decreases.

In the present work, CuO-NiO/rGO nanocomposites were prepared using simple, cost-effective Co-precipitation methods. They act as highly effective electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reactions in an alkaline medium. The structural characterizations demonstrate that prepared nanoparticles (approximate to 13 nm) are tightly and effectively organized on reduced graphene oxide sheets. The electrochemical properties of the CuO, NiO nanoparticles and CuO-NiO, CuO-NiO/rGO nanocomposites were investigated. The results of the CuO-NiO/rGO nanocomposites revealed the high current density (2.9 x 10(-4) mA cm(-2)), lower Tafel slope (72 mV dec(-1)) and low hydrogen peroxide yield (15%) when compared to other prepared materials (CuO, NiO, and CuO-NiO). The reduced graphene oxide increases an electron transfer during the ORR process, while the CuO-NiO has variable oxidation states that promote electro-rich features. With the combination of CuO-NiO and rGO, the hybrid electrocatalysts specific surface area and charge transfer rate drastically increase. The investigations of the rotating ring-disk electrodes experiments indicate that the oxygen reduction process takes place on CuO-NiO/rGO through an efficient four-electron pathway. Our results propose a new approach to creating highly efficient and long-lasting electrocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0013-9351	1096-0953		WOS:000782646600001	35231454

This is confirmed by study of peculiarities of energy metabolism the simulated diving (it is the breath holding with face immersed into the cold water-what we call the cold-hypoxic-hypercapnic effect, CHE). Data of gas analysis have shown that the oxygen consumption rate during the diving imitation is statistically significantly lower than during the usual expiration delay (Genche's test). We have revealed that under effect of adaptation to CHE, on the background of a reduction of the total energy consumption by the organism there occurs a slight increase in contribution of aerobic processes to its energy supply. Adaptation to CHE has been shown to be accompanied by a decrease in reactivity of the parasympathetic chain of regulation of the heart chronotropic function and by an increase of duration of apnea. The apnea duration is directly correlated with level of insulin-the hormone stimulating activity of the anaerobic energy pathway provision. Under effect of adaptation to CHE there has been established an increase of the organism resistance to stress actions, which is confirmed by the lower levels of cortisol and thyroid hormones in representatives of the experimental group as compared with the control one.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0022-0930			WOS:000285355600009

In contrast to previous faceting studies on other refractory metal surfaces, where simple morphologies of the facets were reported, we find a coverage-dependent morphological evolution of the facets ranging from long sawtooth ridges to complex structures exposing four different facets. The faceting occurs only when oxygen coverage (theta) exceeds 0.5 monolayer (ML) and the surface is annealed at >= 700 K. At low oxygen coverage (0.5 ML <=theta < 0.7 ML), the O/Re(1 2(3) over bar 1) surface becomes partially faceted upon annealing; further increasing of oxygen coverage (0.7 ML <=theta < 0.9 ML) causes the surface to become completely faceted, forming long sawtooth ridges along the [(2) over bar 113] direction with typical dimensions of similar to 8 nm in width and > 50 nm in length upon annealing at 1000 K. The size of the ridges grows with annealing temperature and annealing time, and the distance between the ridges is quite uniform. The two sides of each ridge have (01 (1) over bar0) and (11 (2) over bar1) orientations, and atomic-resolution STM images reveal that the edge of the ridge is atomically sharp. For 0.9 ML <=theta < 1 ML, a third set of facets, identified as (10 (1) over bar0), emerges and truncates the original ridges. With the surface fully covered by oxygen (theta=1 ML), a fourth facet (01 (1) over bar1) also becomes prominent upon annealing. This morphological evolution is accompanied by a reduction of the average ridge length along [(2) over bar 113], indicating that the (11 (2) over bar1) facet is metastable. Our work demonstrates that even in a simple adsorbate/substrate system, the adsorbate-induced modification of the anisotropy of surface free energy can induce a complex sequence of changes in the surface morphology. The faceted Re surfaces may be model systems to study structure sensitivity in catalytic reactions, and may also provide promising templates to grow nanostructures.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			2469-9950	2469-9969		WOS:000242409400106

In this study, a simple and inexpensive method is introduced to synthesize a black-red phosphorus (BRP)-doped graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) composite (BRP-g-C3N4). In contrast with g-C3N4, BRP-g-C3N4 showed excellent electrochemical activity towards water splitting in alkaline media. A carbon paste electrode modified with BRP-g-C3N4 (BRP-g-C3N4-CPE) exhibited a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 115 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 430 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 1.0 M KOH. The obtained Tafel slopes were 73 mV dec(-1) for HER with an onset potential of 88 mV and 93 mV dec(-1) for OER with an onset potential of 1.63 V versus RHE. BRP-g-C3N4-CPE showed excellent stability in 1.0 M KOH solution at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for 7 h. Moreover, BRP-g-C3N4 was used as a co-modifier, and AgFeO2, AgO2 and Fe2O3-modified BRP-g-C3N4-CPEs were prepared and their electrocatalytic performance towards HER and OER was examined in 1.0 M KOH. The results showed that the application of BRP-g-C3N4 as a co-modifier significantly enhanced the performance of the metal oxide-modified carbon paste electrode towards water splitting.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2398-4902			WOS:000656137400001

A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying such traits may be useful in the genetic transfer and selection processes. Research was undertaken to compare the effects of controlled water stress on photosynthetic parameters in Triticum kotschyi, a drought resistant wild wheat and Triticum aestivum cv. Lakhish, a drought sensitive wheat cultivar. During stress development, the leaf water potential decreased at a slower rate, and the quantum yield of oxygen evolution, measured photoacoustically in vivo, decreased to a smaller extent in the drought resistant wild wheat than in the wheat cultivar. The decrease in quantum yield at water potentials from -0.9 Mpa down to -2.3 Mpa was not accompanied by damage to PS II reaction centers as there was no change in variable fluorescence. Below -2.3 Mpa the fluorescence yield of both species decreased indicating loss of intrinsic efficiency of PS II. The osmotic potential of cell sap was found to decrease at the same rate in both species at high hydration states. Proline accumulated to a much greater extent in the wild wheat as compared to the cultivated wheat as a result of water stress. Drought resistance was also examined in relation to thylakoid membrane fluidity measured by fluorescence polarization. Thylakoid membrane fluidity was fully maintained in the wild wheat, but decreased substantially in the wheat cultivar, at equal tissue water potentials below -1.9 Mpa. One mechanism for maintaining the higher quantum yield of oxygen evolution during severe stress (at water potentials below -1.9 Mpa), may involve the greater stability of thylakoid membrane fluidity in the wild wheat.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0166-8595			WOS:A1993KL45300004	24318681

The plume propagation in an oxygen environment is examined with pressure ranging from vacuum to few hundreds Pa. Imaging analysis of the plume emission has allowed following the changes in the plume front dynamics as a function of time and pressure. The expansion dynamics of the plume front is examined by means of a theoretical description of plume evolution and shock-wave propagation in dimensionless variables. Optical emission spectroscopy analysis showed that the oxides are mainly formed in the gas-phase through reaction of the ablated atomic species with ambient oxygen. Moreover, we observed that the formation of oxides is strongly favoured at a pressure level where the formation of a shock-wave occurs. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Calculations have been performed using density functional theory with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange correlation functional and a D3 van der Waals corrections. The theoretical insight has been gained into atomic hydrogen interaction with Pt monolayer, supported on both molybdenum and well-studied tungsten carbide, and considering hydrogen surface coverage. Fundamental properties of Pt adlayer depend on the support, affecting hydrogen evolution activity of the resulting systems. At low hydrogen coverage all systems, with the exception of Pt supported on the molybdenum-terminated Mo2C, adsorb H comparably to a pristine Pt(111) surface and their high activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction is predicted. At higher coverages supported Pt monolayers interact with atomic hydrogen unlike the Pt(111), suggesting that the activity of the supported and unsupported platinum toward hydrogen evolution reaction have different origins. Furthermore, the position of the supported platinum monolayers on the volcano curve is a function of the surface coverage, more so than for extended metal surfaces. Therefore, hydrogen surface coverage is a key variable to understand the catalytic potential, approaching towards an improved model for screening of electrocatalytic systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the design and fabrication of such materials remain a significant challenge. In this work, we present Co(3)O(4-x)carbon@Fe2-yCoyO3 heterostructural hollow polyhedrons that have been fabricated by facile thermal treatment followed by solution-phase growth for application as efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OE-R) electrocatalysts. Starting from a single ZIF-67 hollow polyhedron, a novel complex structured composite material constructed from Co304_x nanocrystalliteembedded carbon matrix embedded with Fe2-yCoyO3 nanowires was successfully prepared. The Co3O4, nanocrystallite with oxygen vacancies provides both heterogeneous nucleation sites and growth platform for Fe2-yCoyO3 nanowires. The resultant heterostructure combines the advantages of Fe2-yCoyO3 nanowires with the large surface area and surface defects of Co3O4-x nanocrystallite, resulting in improved electrocatalytic activity and electrical conductivity. Asa result, such novel heterostructured OER electrocatalysts exhibit much lower onset potential (1.52 V) and higher current density (70 mA/cm(2) at 1.7 V) than Co304-carbon hollow polyhedrons (onset 1.55 V, 35 mA/cm(2) at 1.7 V) and pure Co3O4 hollow polyhedrons (onset 1.62 V, 5 mA/cm2 at 1.7 V). Furthermore, the design and synthesis of metal organic framework (MOF)-derived nanomaterials in this work offer new opportunities for developing novel and efficient electrocatalysts in electrochemical devices.									53	6	0	0	1	0	55			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000409395500056	28783430

Within this process, the oxidation of water into molecular oxygen is considered as the bottleneck reaction because it involves the transfer of four electrons toward the oxidation of a highly stable small molecule. Challenges in this area include the development of stable and effective electro- and photocatalysts that utilize readily available metal ions. Herein we report a copper-peptidomimetic complex as an electrocatalyst for water oxidation, which is both highly stable and efficient. Inspired by enzymatic catalysis, which is largely based on intramolecular cooperativity between a metal center and functional organic molecules located on one scaffold, we have designed and synthesized a peptoid trimer bearing a 2,2'-bipyridine (bipy) ligand, an -OH group, and a benzyl group. Both experimental and computational data reveal that binding of Cull to this peptoid in aqueous medium occurs via the bipy group and two hydroxyl moieties from the solution. Based on a systematic electrochemical study, we show that this complex is an active electrocatalyst for water oxidation in aqueous phosphate buffer solution enabling oxygen evolution at pH 11.5 with a turnover frequency of 5.8 s(-1) and a Faradaic efficiency of up to 91%. Importantly, this catalyst is highly stable over at least 15 h of electrolysis. Thus, we could reuse it for at least 9 times in 40 min electrolysis experiments, demonstrate that it retains its activity in every experiment, and obtain oxygen evolution with an overall turnover number record (based on moles oxygen to moles catalyst) of >56 in 6 h. Moreover, based on electrochemical experiments, spectroscopic data, and density functional theory-D3 calculations, we identified a key peroxo intermediate and propose an intramolecular cooperative catalytic path for this reaction, which suggests that the -OH group has a major role in the high stability of the complex.									38	3	0	0	4	0	39			2155-5435			WOS:000449723900077

Herein, we show an effective approach for constructing a Co3O4@CoxFe3-xO4 hierarchical nanostructure with obviously improved electrocatalytic activity relative to CoxFe3-xO4 nanoplate and Co3O4 nanowire films. The enhancement is attributed to the formation of secondary CoxFe3-xO4 nanoplates outside of the Co3O4 nanowires, leading to a fantastic porous architecture that results in a more active electrocatalyst.									8	1	0	0	1	0	9			2046-2069			WOS:000347721300041

Herein, we introduce a heterostructure comprising perovskite oxides (La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta) and molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) as an electrochemical catalyst for overall water electrolysis. Interestingly, formation of the heterostructure of La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta and MoSe2 induces a local phase transition in MoSe2, 2 H to 1 T phase, and more electrophilic La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta with partial oxidation of the Co cation owing to electron transfer from Co to Mo. Together with these synergistic effects, the electrochemical activities are significantly improved for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. In the overall water splitting operation, the heterostructure showed excellent stability at the high current density of 100 mA cm(-2) over 1,000 h, which is exceptionally better than the stability of the state-of-the-art platinum and iridium oxide couple.									97	3	0	0	5	0	98			2041-1723			WOS:000464338100034	30979877

A combination of analytical techniques including XRD, XPS, SEM-EDX, TEM, and BET were utilized for the characterization of the materials. Microscopy images show that urea-stabilized NiCo2O4-NiO (UeNiCo) has urchin-like morphology assembled by nanowires, and CTAC stabilization (C-NiCo) led to the formation of microspheres with nanoplate assembly. In addition, both wires and plates are formed by the assembly of individual NiCo2O4-NiO nanoparticles. Then, glassy carbon electrodes were modified with these hierarchical nanomaterials, and their electrochemical behavior in oxygen evolution reaction was investigated in 0.1 M KOH solution. Although both of the materials had similar onset potentials (1.56 V vs RHE for U-NiCo and 1.57 V vs RHE for C-NiCo), U-NiCo could drive 10 mA cm(-2) of current density at a lower overpotential value (387 mV) than C-NiCo (430 mV). Both of the materials demonstrated impressive kinetic performance with low Tafel slopes (49 mV dec(-1) for U-NiCo and 44 mV dec(-1) for C-NiCo) and good stability during long-term constant potential electrolysis. In addition, NiCo2O4-NiO nanomaterials outperformed RuO2 at high catalytic current densities (i.e., eta(50) = 518 mV for U-NiO and eta(50) = 622 mV for RuO2). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This review focuses on how X-ray spectroscopy has provided important information about the structure of this Mn complex and its intermediates, or S-states, in the water oxidation cycle. X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy and high-resolution Mn K beta X-ray emission spectroscopy experiments have identified the oxidation states of the Mn in the OEC in each of the intermediate S-states, while extended X-ray absorption fine structure experiments have shown that 2.7 Angstrom Mn-Mn di-mu -oxo and 3.3 Angstrom Mn-Mn mono-CL-oxo motifs are present in the OEC. X-ray spectroscopy has also been used to probe the two essential cofactors in the OEC, Ca2+ and Cl-, and has shown that Ca2+ is an integral component of the OEC and is proximal to Mn. In addition, dichroism studies on oriented PS II membranes have provided angular information about the Mn-Mn and Mn-Ca vectors. Based on these X-ray spectroscopy data, refined models for the structure of the OEC and a mechanism for oxygen evolution by the OEC are presented. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

These crystals were synthesized using the hydrothermal method and were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Rietveld refinement, and TEM techniques. XRD and Rietveld results confirmed that beta-Ag2MoO4 has a spinel-type cubic structure. The optical properties were investigated by UV-Vis spectroscopy. DFT+U formalism, via on-site Coulomb corrections for the d orbital electrons of Ag and Mo atoms (U-d) and the 2p orbital electrons of O atoms (U-p) provided an improved band gap for beta-Ag2MoO4. Examination of the density of states revealed the energy states in the valence and conduction bands of the beta-Ag2MoO4 and Ag2O. The theoretical band structure indicated an indirect band gap of approximately 3.41 eV. Furthermore, CO2 electroreduction, and hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions on the surface of beta-Ag2MoO4 and Ag2O were studied and a comparative investigation on molybdate-derived silver and oxide-derived silver was performed. The electrochemical results demonstrate that beta-Ag2MoO4 and Ag2O can be good electrocatalysts for water splitting and CO2 reduction. The CO2 electroreduction results also indicate that CO2 reduction intermediates adsorbed strongly on the surface of Ag2O, which increased the overpotential for the hydrogen evolution reaction on the surface of Ag2O by as much as 0.68 V against the value of 0.6 V for Ag2MoO4, at a current density of -1.0 mA cm(-2).									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000639426800001	33885060

Si(CH,),Cl has been used as volatile precursor of Si and pure oxygen as plasma gas. Plasma conditions were characterised by optical emission spectroscopy as a function of the relative flow rates of oxygen and precursor. The oxygen plasma was characterised by emission lines and bands due to O* and O-2(-) species whose relative intensity decreased as the flow rate of the precursor increased. Then, the plasma was dominated by the emission lines of H* species formed by dissociation of the precursor molecules, From the evolution of the intensity of the emission of oxygen and hydrogen lines as a function of the relative concentration of oxygen and precursor and by considering the composition and microstructure of the obtained thin films. a model is proposed for the decomposition mechanism of the precursor. According to this model. Si-Cl bond would dissociate in a first step. Then a series of reactions would follow with the activated oxygen species that, depending on the relative flow rate of oxygen, lead to the formation of SiO2 or a polymeric SiO3C4H2 material. The chemical composition of the films was analysed by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS), electron recoil detection analysis (ERDA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), while their structure and microstructure were investigated by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FF-IR). It has been also shown that the SiO,C,H. thin films, with typical compositions such as Si:1, O:2, C:3.6, H:5.5, yield SiO2 thin films by exposure to a plasma of oxygen. These SiO2 thin films were smoother than the parent SiO3C4H7 samples and the silica films prepared by PECVD under oxygen rich conditions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Herein, metal-semiconductor hybrids are reported with metallic nanoalloys on various defective oxide nanowire arrays (Cu/CuOx, Co/CoOx, and CuCo/CuCoOx) as typical Mott-Schottky electrocatalysts. To build the highway of continuous electron transport between metals and semiconductors, nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) has been implanted on metal-semiconductor nanowire array as core-shell conductive architecture. As expected, NC/CuCo/CuCoOx nanowires arrays, as integrated Mott-Schottky electrocatalysts, present an overpotential of 112 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1) for HER, simultaneously delivering an overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER. Most importantly, NC/CuCo/CuCoOx architectures, as both the anode and the cathode for overall water splitting, exhibit a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.53 V with excellent stability due to high conductivity, large active surface area, abundant active sites, and the continuous electron transport from prominent synergetic effect among metal, semiconductor, and nitrogen-doped carbon. This work represents an avenue to design and develop efficient and stable Mott-Schottky bifunctional electrocatalysts for promising energy conversion.									164	8	0	0	8	0	164			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000422930400005

More importantly, gamma-MnO2 nanosheets and beta-MnO2 octahedrons were prepared for the first time by a one-step microwave-assisted method. The electrocatalytic activities of the synthesized MnO2 in KOH solution have been determined by cyclic voltammetry and the results show that all manganese dioxides can catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline medium with different catalytic activities. alpha-MnO2 nanorods appear to hold the highest catalytic activity due to their crystal phase/morphology with appropriate oxygen adsorption mode.

However, disadvantages limit its commercial applications. Therefore, modification of PCN in order to increase the hydrogen evolution rate and stability of the photocatalyst are extensively studied. In this contribution, we compare the influence of oxidation and the number of walls in carbon nanotubes (SWCNT and MWCNT) on the photocatalytic performance of PCN. It was found that oxidation of both types of CNT enhanced a photocurrent response, interfacial charge transfer and separation properties leading to the enhanced hydrogen evolution rate. Interestingly, MWCNT were found to enhance the charge transfer and separation properties more significantly. However, this material affected inferior co-catalytic behavior. We suggest it was related to the lower number of reactive electrons migrating to the surface reaction sites because of transferring to the inner tubes. SWCNT influence similar to 12-fold increase in H-2 evolution rate, while MWCNT influenced similar to 8-fold enhancement in comparison to pristine PCN.									9	1	0	0	1	0	9			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000516818700060

A pilot facility treating 15 kg/h biomass was run at different equivalent ratios (ERs) and steam-to-biomass ratios (S/Bs).

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses show that burl-like clusters with characteristic fluffy NiCo2Se4 and flake-like CoNi2Se4 hierarchical structures were deposited on the Ni-foam substrates. When used as battery-type electrodes in supercapacitors, both NiCo2Se4 and CoNi2Se4 electrodes exhibited outstanding capacity and good electrochemical properties. The CoNi2Se4 electrode delivered excellent capacity and cycling stability (602 C g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and 98.30% retention after 5000 cycles at 40 A g(-1)) when compared to the NiCo2Se4 electrode (353 C g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and 96.83% retention after 5000 cycles at 40 A g(-1)). Furthermore, as-deposited NiCo2Se4 and CoNi2Se4 hierarchical structures were employed as efficient electrocatalysts for water oxidation in alkaline solutions. NiCo2Se4 and CoNi2Se4 electrocatalysts showed low overpotentials of 257 and 244 mV in a 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution, respectively. The electrocatalysts also exhibited prolonged stability (NiCo2Se4 and CoNi2Se4 maintained currents of 95.6% and 97.5%, respectively, over 10 h), which makes them comparable to well-known Ni and Co-based catalysts. Collectively, the as-deposited NiCo2Se4 and CoNi2Se4 are the most efficient bifunctional electrodes and electrocatalysts for application in battery-type supercapacitors and the oxygen evolution reaction, respectively, and can potentially be applied for energy conversion and storage processes.

The abundance of oxygen has been derived from measurements of the oxygen triplet at 7771-5 Angstrom in high resolution spectra obtained with KeckI/HIRES and the forbidden line [O I] 6300 Angstrom detected in the TNG/SARG spectra of CS 29498-043. Detailed non-LTE analysis of Fe lines has provided reliable stellar parameters which, however, do not resolve the oxygen abundance conflict as derived from the O I 7771-5 Angstrom triplet and the [O I] 6300 Angstrom forbidden lines. We obtained the following oxygen abundance: for CS 22949-037 [O/Fe] = 3.13, 1.95; and for CS 29498-043; [O/Fe] = 3.02, 2.49, based on the O I 7771-5 Angstrom triplet and the [O I] 6300 Angstrom forbidden line, respectively. A similar conflict appears to exist between the forbidden resonance line Mg 14571 Angstrom and several subordinate lines, such as Mg 15172 and 5183 Angstrom. Our analysis demonstrates the failure of standard plane-parallel atmosphere models to describe the physical conditions in the line-forming regions of these ultra-metal-poor giants.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			1432-0746			WOS:000221913100034

Pure and doped (or hybrid) Co oxide systems are of particular interest due to their good efficiency. However, the electronic effects of different dopants are still unclear in many of these systems. We present a study of doped Co-phosphate (P-i) films deposited electrochemically from aqueous solutions of neutral pH using an X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), a technique that can reveal important information about catalytically active states. These hybrid films, obtained from solutions containing both Co ions and another transition metal (TM) ion (TM = Mn, Fe, Ni), were analyzed with XAS at the TM L-edges and the O K-edge. We find that a large concentration of Co3+-ions in the films and a low-lying edge of the O 2p conduction band (CB) are good indicators for the OER efficiency of the films. Our results show that native Co-P-i is close to optimal for the OER activity at low deposition potential. However, Mn- and Ni-doped systems have promising properties when deposited at higher potentials because these ions tend to stabilize the Co3+-state in the films as well as the position of the O 2p-edge CB (a few tenths of 1 eV), in contrast to native Co-Pi films.

However, the origin of the enhanced activity is still controversial because the structure-function relationship governing the enhancement remains elusive. Herein, sulfur(S)-doped Fe-1-NC catalyst was obtained as a model, which displays a superior activity for ORR towards the traditional Fe-NC materials. Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that incorporation of S in the second coordination sphere of Fe-1-NC can induce the transition of spin polarization configuration. Operando Fe-57 Mossbauer spectra definitively identified the low spin single-Fe3+-atom of C-FeN4-S moiety as the active site for ORR. Moreover, DFT calculations unveiled that lower spin state of the Fe center after the S doping promotes OH* desorption process. This work elucidates the underlying mechanisms towards S doping for enhancing ORR activity, and paves a way to investigate the function of broader heteroatom doped Fe-1-NC catalysts to offer a general guideline for spin-state-determined ORR.									28	1	0	0	1	0	28			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000709442700001	34550627

Mikrobiologiia				49	6			859	66						1980 Nov-Dec	1980	Oxygen reduction in the photosystem II (PS II) of thylakoid membranes from the cyanobacteria Anacystis nidulans and Anabaena variabilis was studied in the system SiMo + DCMU in whose presence competitive electron transport to SiMo and O2 in possible. The reagents of the Mehler reaction were used; these reagents activate oxygen uptake by interacting with the reduced forms of oxygen (malonate and oxalate with O2; glyoxylate and catalase + ethanol with H2O2). The use of the reagents as shown that there was a considerable electron transport to O2 which decreased the rate of SiMo reduction and visible oxygen evolution. Oxygen was reduced to O2 and H2O2 in the photosystem II of A. nidulans whereas practically no generation of H2O2 was observed in the photosystem II of A. variabilis. Malate was found to be capable of activating oxygen uptake in the PS II of the cyanobacteria by interacting with O2. Oxalate was capable of this interaction only in the membranes of A. variabilis, but not in the membranes of A. nidulans where it competed with water as an electron donor. A decrease in SiMo reduction and oxygen evolution in A. nidulans in the presence of glycolate was due to oxidation of glyoxylate which was formed in the course of enzyme-catalyzed oxidation of glycolate by the membranes possessing the activity of glycolate oxidase, and the subsequent interaction of glyoxylate with H2O2. SiMo reduction by the cyanobacterial membranes and by the spheroplasts of A. variabilis, in contrast to the chloroplasts of higher plants, did not decrease in the presence of DCMU, but went on at a linear rate until the substrate was completely exhausted. The role of reduced O2 forms in metabolism of a phototrophic cell is discussed.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0026-3656			MEDLINE:6782430	6782430	
J	Ma, Zhong; Zhang, Shuai; Lu, Yonggang								Activation Mechanism of Fe2O3-Al2O3 Oxygen Carrier in Chemical Looping Combustion								ENERGY & FUELS				34	12			16350	16355		10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c02967				DEC 17 2020	2020	Because of the low cost and easy availability, iron oxides have been widely used in chemical looping combustion. However, pure iron oxides often suffered from a loss of oxygen carrying capacity in redox cycles due to thermal sintering. The redox performance of iron oxides can be improved by the addition of Al2O3 as a support. In this study, the investigation was carried out regarding the activation behavior of a Fe2O3-Al2O3 oxygen carrier in initial cycles. The combined use of different textural and morphological characterization techniques (X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS, Hg intrusion, and scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive spectrometry (SEM-EDS)) was conducted to reveal how microscopic changes triggered the activation of the Fe2O3-Al2O3 sample. It indicated that the activation process of the Fe2O3-Al2O3 sample was caused by the outward migration of Fe cations to the sample surface. A fresh sample presented a surface with a dense and nonporous structure. However, once the sample was activated after the cyclic reactions, Fe cations were enriched on the sample surface in the form of small grains. This leads to enhanced redox activity and increased oxygen carrying capacity.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000600407600098

Physical characterizations including X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy demonstrate that s-IrO2 catalyst has excellent uniformity and regularity in particle shape and much ordered distribution in geometric space, and Pt/s-IrO2 catalyst shows a uniform Pt dispersion on the surface of the s-1rO(2) particles. Electrochemical analyses prove that s-IrO2 catalyst possesses superior OER activity at operating potentials; and that Pt/s-IrO2 catalyst, in comparison to Pt/commercial IrO2, has higher ESA value and ORR catalytic performance with a mechanism of four-electron pathway and a high ORR efficiency. And as a bifunctional oxygen catalyst, Pt/s-IrO2 also exhibits more remarkable OER performance than the commercial one. The s-IrO2 nanopartides will be a promising active component (for OER), and suitable for Pt support (for ORR). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Here, a composite electrode of Co3O4@CoWP is synthesized, where an ultrathin layer composed of Co(3)O(4)nanoparticles is grown on CoWP nanowires supported on a carbon cloth (CC). The Co3O4@CoWP/CC electrode exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity and improved kinetics towards both the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER). The Co3O4@CoWP/CC electrode achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)at a low overpotential of 269 mV for the OER and -10 mA cm(-2)at 118 mV for the HER in 1.0 M KOH solution. The voltage applied to a two-electrode water electrolyzer for overall water splitting, while employing the Co3O4@CoWP/CC electrode as both an anode and a cathode, in order to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), is 1.61 V, which is better than that for the majority of reported non-noble electrocatalysts. Moreover, the Co3O4@CoWP/CC electrode exhibits good stability over 24 h with slight attenuation. The electrode benefits from the enhanced adsorption of oxygen intermediates on Co(3)O(4)during the OER, the increased ability for water dissociation and the optimized H adsorption/desorption ability of CoWP nanowires during the HER. This study provides a feasible approach for cost-effective and high-performance non-noble metal bifunctional catalysts for overall water electrolysis.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10				2046-2069		WOS:000560694000033	35521139

(1999) Biochemistry 38: 404-414). A site-directed mutant of MSP, C28A, C51A, which lacks the -S-S- bridge, also binds to PS II at wild-type levels and reconstitutes oxygen evolution activity [Betts et al. (1996) Biochim Biophys Acta 1274: 135-142], although the mutant protein is even more disordered in solution. Both WT and C28A, C51A MSP aggregate upon heating, but an examination of the effects of protein concentration and pH on heat-induced aggregation showed that each MSP species exhibited greater resistance to aggregation at a pH near their pI (5.2) than do either bovine serum albumin (BSA) or carbonic anhydrase, which were used as model water soluble proteins. Increases in pH above the pI of the MSPs and BSA enhanced their aggregation resistance, a behavior which can be predicted from their charge (MSP) or a combination of charge and stabilization by -S-S- bonds (BSA). In the case of aggregation resistance by MSP, this is likely to be an important factor in its ability to avoid unproductive self-association reactions in favor of formation of the protein-protein interactions that lead to formation of the functional oxygen evolving complex.

This point is illustrated with two examples: The first involves modeling equilibrium and fractional crystallization of midocean ridge basalts. Attention is focused on the variation of intensive parameters (like oxygen fugacity) and heat output with crystallization, and how the latter can impact fluid dynamical modeling. The second example illustrates modeling mantle metling during closed-system adiabatic ascent. Here thermodynamic modeling leads to quantitative predictions of melt productivity, which may be used to interpret melt generation rates and chemical characteristics of lavas produced from volcanic centers.									56	5	0	0	0	0	59			0084-6597			WOS:A1997XB77200007

In this paper we present three different multiscale individual-cell-based models, each motivated by cancer-related problems emerging from each of the spatial scales: extracellular, cellular or subcellular, but also incorporating relevant information from other levels. We apply these hybrid models to investigate the influence of the microenvironement on tumour invasion, cell-cell collaboration and competition leading to the initiation and growth of epithelial tumours, and to evolution of cell phenotypes/genotypes arising in tumours growing in different oxygen concentrations. We also discuss how these models relate to one another and can be used to bridge biological scales relevant to cancer.									28	0	1	0	15	0	30			0973-5348	1760-6101		WOS:000207833400001

Its phase composition, lattice structure, electrochemical catalytic activity and full cell performance are investigated. The electrocatalytic activity and stability of the LSCF113 cathode are enhanced by in situ formation of LSCF214 on the LSCF113 surface. The electrochemical performance enhancement is due to the higher catalytic activity of the LSCF214 Ruddlesden-Popper phase and the mismatch of the lattice parameters between the LSCF214 and LSCF113 regions leading to more favorable oxygen vacancy formation and oxygen molecule adsorption. The electrochemical impedance spectrum indicates that LSCF113-214 electrode has a lower polarization resistance (0.17 Omega cm(2)) than the LSCF113 electrode (0.32 Omega cm(2)) at 650 degrees C. And the long term stability of LSCF113-214 is evaluated with no structure evolution in 400 h test at 600 degrees C. An anode-supported single cell with doped ceria as the electrolyte is used to evaluate the electrochemical performance of LSCF113-214, which shows an open circuit voltage of 0.81 V and a maximum power density of 0.57 W cm(-2) at 650 degrees C.

Oxygen vacancies were generated by reducing treatment under H-2/Ar atmosphere at an elevated temperature. The phase composition, morphology, microstructure and chemical composition of the samples were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). When used as the anode materials for lithium ion batteries, the optimized NiO electrode possessed a reversible capacity of 678.8 mAh g(-1 )after 30 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g(-1), while the reversible capacity of the untreated electrode was only 82.5 mAh g(-1). At a higher current density of 1.0 A g(-1), the reversible capacity was 152.2 mAh g(-1), which is 15 times larger than that of the pristine NiO electrode. The synergistic effects of optimized oxygen vacancies and porous sheet-like morphology are responsible for the enhanced lithium storage properties.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1044-5803	1873-4189		WOS:000546909300021

Recently, anomalous Ti oxide-rich surface phases of ternary oxides have been stabilized as nonstoichiometric epitaxial overlayers. These structures give rise to different modes of oxygen binding, which may lead to different oxidative chemistry. Through density functional theory investigations and electrochemical measurements, we predict and subsequently show that such a TiO2 double-layer surface reconstruction enhances the oxygen evolving activity of the perovskite-type oxide SrTiO3. Our theoretical work suggests that the improved activity of the restructured TiO2(001) surface toward oxygen formation stems from (i) having two Ti sites with distinct oxidation activity and (ii) being able to form a strong O-O moiety (which reduces overbonding at Ti sites), which is a direct consequence of (iii) having a labile lattice O that is able to directly participate in the reaction. Here, we demonstrate the improvement of the catalytic performance of a well-known and well-studied oxide catalyst through more modern methods of materials processing, predicted through first-principles theoretical modeling.									52	0	0	0	1	0	52			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000350614700027	25664759

The following points were elucidated: (1) Plutonium (IV) is involved in the G-value for hydrogen generation. The difference in G-values in Cm-244-HNO3 solution and Pu(IV)-HNO3 solution can be explained by the presence of Pu. (2) No significant effect of the difference of oxidation states, Pu(IV)/Pu(VI), resulting from heating solution on the hydrogen generation was observed. (3) Radiolytic evolution of hydrogen in plutonium nitrate solutions depends upon a height of the solution in a vessel, although this dependence is apparently less than that observed under gamma-radiation. (4) The effect of the solution height would be explained by a reaction between OH and H-2 because the effect can be approximately described by concentrations of undissociated HNO3 and Pu(IV), which are thought to be primary scavengers of OH radicals. (5) The G-value for oxygen generation in plutonium nitrate solutions was roughly in accord with that observed in the CM-244/Po-210-HNO3 system.									9	0	0	0	1	0	10			0022-3131	1881-1248		WOS:A1993ME67500008

A comparison among these techniques is undertaken with respect to the decrease of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total suspended solids (TSS) and the evolution of chloride ions. Optimum operating conditions for each process under study revealed the effect of the initial amounts of Fe(II) and hydrogen peroxide. Of the tested processes, photo-Fenton process was found to be the fastest one with respect to COD and TSS reduction of the wastewater within 45 min reaction time uncles low amounts of Fe(II) and hydrogen peroxide of 0.5 and 1.5 mg/L, respectively, and amounted to 79.6% and 96.6% COD and TSS removal. The initial biodegradability of the organic matter present in the effluent, estimated as the BOD5/COD, was low 0.21. When the effluent was submitted to the different types of AOPs used in this study, the biodegradability increases significantly. Within 45 min of reaction time, the photo-Fenton process appears as the most efficient process in the enhancement of the biodegradability of the organic matter in the effluent and the BOD5/COD ratio increased from 0.21 to 0.7.

J	Zhao, Shanhui; Luo, Yonghao; Zhang, Yunliang; Long, Yufeng								Experimental investigation of the synergy effect of partial oxidation and bio-char on biomass tar reduction								JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL AND APPLIED PYROLYSIS				112				262	269		10.1016/j.jaap.2015.01.016				MAR 2015	2015	In order to reveal the synergy effect of partial oxidation and bio-char on tar reduction and develop more efficient tar removal method, the tar and bio-char evolution properties were investigated on a bench-scaled fixed-bed reactor. The tar components, tar conversion rates, physical and chemical structure of bio-char after reaction at the second stage were sampled and analyzed. Results showed that at 700 degrees C, the coupling of char and oxygen could result in the significant improvement of tar conversion rate (89.32%) than both two separated method (85.1% and 86.14%). At 900 degrees C, the synergy effect could reach the highest conversion rate of 95.84%. High oxygen concentration coupling with char may lead to carbon deposition and bring down tar conversion rate at 800 degrees C. But a light amount of oxygen greatly promoted the formation of porosity. The reaction between tar and bio-char at high temperature (800 degrees C above) was in favor of toluene conversion. The coupling of char and partial oxidation benefited the elimination of larger PAHs tar compounds as well as toluene. BET analysis results showed that oxygen promoted the development of bio-char porosity at 700 degrees C and 900 degrees C under all oxygen concentrations. Slight amount of oxygen would benefit the char pore development, but high oxygen concentration (5%) would lead to the carbon deposition on char pore surface at 800 degrees C. FTIR results indicated that temperature and oxygen promoted the aromatic or graphitization of bio-char. The IR band peak of 1060 cm(-1) showed the similar tendency with aromatic ring band peak, which meant more carbon deposition on the surface of char pore but not graphitization. The coupling of partial oxidation and char catalysis is a feasible method for tar reduction of biomass tar. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Journal of the American Chemical Society				144	29			13163	13173		10.1021/jacs.2c02989				2022-07-27	2022	Hydrogen production from water electrolysis in neutral-pH electrolytes can not only avoid the corrosion and safety issues and expand the catalyst option but also potentially integrate with artificial photosynthesis and bioelectrocatalysis. However, heterogeneous catalysts that can efficiently negotiate the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in neutral solutions are considerably lacking. Herein, we report a template-assisted strategy for the synthesis of 13 kinds of tube-like nanostructured perovskite oxides (TNPOs) with markedly high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface areas. By systematic examination of these TNPOs, we found that the OER activity of TNPOs in neutral solution exhibits a volcano shape as a function of the covalency of transition metal-oxygen bonds. Consequently, our designed Sm-doped LaCoO3 catalyst yields a geometric current density of 8.5 mA cm-2 at 1.75 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode in 1 M phosphate buffer solution (pH 7) due to the optimized covalency of Co 3d and O 2p states, representing the most active noble-metal-free OER catalyst in neutral electrolytes reported as yet.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1520-5126		MEDLINE:35849786	35849786

Here, sunlight-assisted combustion synthesis of a nanoscale metal oxide (CeO2) is reported. The sunlight, as a clean renewable energy source, is used for the first time to initiate the exothermic combustion reaction and to introduce oxygen vacancies into the CeO2. The current synthesis setup controls the environmental problems of gas evolution, usually associated with the conventional method, and thus maintains the green pathway. Additionally, for comparison, CeO2 nanoparticles are also synthesized using the conventional solution combustion method (CeO2-CSC). It is found that the CeO2 synthesized using sunlight-assisted combustion (CeO(2)SAC) possesses a smaller particle size, a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies, and a narrower band gap than the CeO2CSC. Therefore, CeO2-SAC demonstrates higher photocatalytic performance in converting CO2 to CH3OH (0.702 mu mol h(-1)) than the CeO2-CSC (0.397 mu mol g(-1)), thus pointing toward environmentally benign photocatalytic CO2 reduction.									79	2	0	0	1	0	79			2574-0970			WOS:000510073600015

The unicellular acidophilic and mesothermophilic red alga Galdieria sulphuraria (074G) can grow autotrophically in light as well as heterotrophically in the dark. In this paper, the effects of externally added glucose on primary and secondary photosynthetic reactions are assessed to elucidate mixotrophic capacities of the alga. Photosynthetic O-2 evolution was quantified in an open system with a constant Supply Of CO2 to avoid rapid volatilization of dissolved inorganic carbon at low pH levels. In the presence of glucose, O-2 evolution was repressed even in illuminated cells. Ratios of variable to maximum chlorophyll fluorescence (F-v/F-m) and 77 Kfluorescence spectra indicated a reduced photochemical efficiency of photosystem II. The results were corroborated by strongly reduced levels of the photosystem 11 reaction centre protein D1. The downregulation of primary photosynthetic reactions was accompanied by reduced levels of the Calvin Cycle enzyme ribu lose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylaselfoxygenase (Rubisco). Both effects depended on functional sugar uptake and are thus initiated by intracellular rather than extracellular glucose. Following glucose depletion, photosynthetic O-2 evolution of illuminated cells commenced after 15 h and Rubisco levels again reached the levels of autotrophic cells. It is concluded that true mixotrophy, involving electron transport across both photosystems, does not occur in G. sulphuraria 074G, and that heterotrophic growth is favoured over autotrophic growth if sufficient organic carbon is available.									62	2	0	0	53	0	64			0960-7412	1365-313X		WOS:000248790500013	17587234

Although numerous perovskite materials owing to rich selections of A and B-site elements are reported as electrodes of supercapatteries, the effect of the crystal structure of perovskite materials on their electrochemical performance has never been studied so far. Herein, using SrCo0.9Mo0.1O3-delta, SrFeO3-delta, Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta, and LaMnO3-delta as research targets, it is proved that their corresponding cubic structure materials display the best electrochemical performance. And then, the origin of such superiority of cubic structure for SrCo0.9Mo0.1O3-delta is explored through experimental investigations and theoretical calculations. The results show that the increase in the content of oxygen vacancies and the enhancement of B-O hybridization of cubic structure can optimize the electronic structure of the perovskite materials, thereby improving its conductivity and accelerating the reaction kinetics. The filtering strategy based on crystal structure proposed by this report will provide a new perspective to faster and more efficient choice of perovskite materials for supercapatteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000793242700001

However, challenging top-down synthesis strategies still hinder electrocatalytic applications. Here, we directly fabricate 2D NiFe-MOF NSs induced by carboxylated carbon quantum dots (CQDs-COOH) in-situ through a one-step room-temperature "bottom-up" synthesis strategy without additional complex and low-yield exfoliation processes. Density functional theory calculations confirm that CQDs-COOH enlarges the layer spacing of the NiFe-MOF and effectively induces the formation of NiFe-MOF NSs via electron-withdrawing - COOH groups. Furthermore, CQDs-COOH increases the positive charge on the active sites and improves the OER performance of NiFe-MOF. NiFe-MOF NSs@CQDs-COOH shows a low overpotential of 261 mV to reach a 10-mA cm(-2) current density and a small Tafel slope of 56 mV dec(-1) and exhibits high durability after 48 h of long-term testing. These excellent electrocatalytic performances are also illustrated by application in a rechargeable Zn-air flow battery, which demonstrates an open-circuit voltage of 1.42 V, a 133.5 degrees static contact angle, and an excellent specific capacity of 895.5 mAh g(Zn)(-1). The universal CQD-induced approach for bottom-up synthesis of high-efficiency 2D MOF NSs will facilitate the progress of 2D catalysts to construct state-of-the-art energy conversion and storage devices.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1369-7021	1873-4103		WOS:000832710800008

Unfortunately, the high cost and less than perfect efficiency hinder wide-range industrial/technological applications. Here, by controlling the treatment temperature of tris (2,2-bipyridine) ruthenium dichloride hexahydrate, synthesis of compounds with novel ruthenium single/dual atoms (Ru S/DAs) mixed with Ru nanoclusters (Ru S/DAs + Ru NCs) and supported by carbon dots is demonstrated. These compounds are shown to be highly efficient and competitive catalysts for hydrogen evolution. Ru S/DAs + Ru NCs exhibit very high activity, with overpotentials of 15 and 40 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) in 1.0 mol/L KOH and 0.5 mol/L H2SO4, respectively. Furthermore, the composites are found to possess outstanding stability and rapid HER kinetics. X ray absorption fine structure analysis, supported by density functional theory calculations, shows charge rearrangement in single-atomic Ru, and the Ru dual sites promote active hydrogen adsorption and recombination. Ru S/DAs and Ru NCs demonstrate high electroactivity due to the electroactive Ru 4d orbitals. The introduction of Ru NCs activates the carbon support, providing a high electronic conductivity to transfer electrons from Ru NCs to Ru S/DAs, and facilitates water dissociation for the HER process.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2766-8525	2688-819X		WOS:000846867500007

To develop an approach for practical applications, it is imperative to improve their electrocatalytic performance. Herein, we report the fabrication of hollow NiMoP nanopetals embedded with N-doped carbon dots (CDs) by a simple hydrothermal method. The addition of CDs can effectively modulate the morphology, reduce aggregation, and maintain long-term stability. Impressively, the optimal Ni5Mo3P@CDs(3) exhibits excellent HER performance, in terms of a low overpotential of 183 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope of 41.04 mV dec(-1), high conductivity, and remarkable long-term stability in acidic media for HER This work opens an effective avenue to construct excellent property and accessible electrocatalysts for HER with the assistance of CDs.									28	2	0	0	0	0	29			0888-5885			WOS:000480496100029

However, it suffers sluggish kinetics for driving the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process because of inert basal planes, especially in alkaline solution. Here, we show a combination of heteroatom doping and phase transformation strategies to engineer the inplane structure of MoS2, that trigger their catalytic activities. Systematic characterizations are performed with advanced aberration-corrected microscopy and X-ray techniques, indicating that an as-designed MoS2 catalyst has a distorted zigzag-chain superlattice in metallic phase, while its in-plane structure was engineered via the incorporation of cobalt and oxygen species. The optimal Co, O dual-doped metallic phase molybdenum disulfide (1T-MoS2) electrocatalyst shows a significantly enhanced HER activity with a low overpotential of 113 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and corresponding small Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1), accompanied by the robust stability in alkaline media. The calculated turnover frequency is higher than 6.65 H-2 s(-1) at an overpotential of 200 mV. More in-depth insights from the first-principle calculations illustrate that the water dissociation as a rate-determining step was largely accelerated by the in-plane Co-O-Mo species and fast electron transfer of the catalyst. Benefiting from ingenious design and fine identifications, this work provides a fundamental understanding of the relationships among heteroatom doping, phase transformation, and performance for MoS2-based catalysts.									50	4	0	0	1	0	50			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000492801600083	31525961

The electrocatalytic activity of the hybrid catalyst is tested with respect to oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction (ORR) reactions in alkali. Physicochemical characterizations confirm the unique formation of a reduced graphene oxide-non-noble-metal sulfide hybrid. Electrochemical evaluation by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear-sweep voltammetry (LSV) reveals that the CuCo2S4@B,N-rGO hybrid possesses enhanced ORR and OER activity compared to the B,N-rGO-free CuCo2S4 catalyst. The synthesized CuCo2S4@ B,N-rGO hybrid demonstrates remarkable enhancement in catalytic performance with an improved onset potential (1.50 and 0.88 V) and low Tafel slope (112 and 73 mV dec-1) for both OER and ORR processes, respectively. In addition, the catalyst exhibits a diminutive potential difference (0.81 V) between the potential corresponding to the 10 mA cm-2 current density for OER and the half-wave potential for ORR. The superior catalytic activity and high durability of the hybrid material may be attributed to the synergistic effect arising from the metal sulfide and dual-doped reduced graphene oxide. The present study illuminates the possibility of using the dual-doped graphene oxide and metal sulfide hybrid as a competent bifunctional cathode catalyst for renewable energy application.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-1343			WOS:000811919800001	35721942

Here, SPD-annealing strategy is demonstrated to prepare ordered low-Pt-loading Pd-Pt-Fe nanoalloys with an average particle size of less than 5 nm and excellent electrocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the ORR performances of Pd-Pt-Fe/C nanoalloy catalysts are rationally modified by means of both precise composition control and structural transformation. With an optimal component proportion, the prepared Pd0.75Pt0.25 Fe/C catalyst exhibits the most excellent intrinsic activity due to the synergistic interaction of lattice strain and ligand effect. Benefiting from the compressive strain effect induced by the relatively tight arrangement of the ordered structure, the adsorption energy of the intermediate oxygen-containing species is effectively weakened, enabling the Pd0.75Pt0.25 Fe/C to obtain enhanced ORR catalytic performance in acidic condition. Notably, compared with the disordered Pd0.75Pt0.25 Fe/C, the ordered Pd-0.75 Pt-0.25 Fe/C shows an extremely superior stability of 98.5% mass activity retention after 10 000 cycles.

In this work, a three-dimensional ordered macroporous structure (3DOM) HxWO3-y with oxygen vacancies was constructed, which promoted the activation of nitrogen and increased charge carrier separation, thus improving the photocatalytic nitrogen reduction ability with a value of 7.4 mu mol g(-1) h(-1). The nitrogen reduction ability of 3DOM HxWO3-y was further improved to 34 mu mol g(-1 )h(-1) by loading NiPx nanospheres onto the 3DOM structure, which is similar to 5 times than 3DOM HxWO3-y.

A detailed analysis of the optical and redox properties has been carried out by comparing their optical spectroscopy, electrochemistry and spectroelectrochemistry to a series of DFT and TD-DFT calculations. A series of experiments demonstrate that these Cu(III)corroles can be used as highly effective catalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs). Moreover, when the number of fluorine atoms at B meso-position is increased, there is a marked enhancement in the catalytic ability of the corrole complexes, which demonstrates that modification to the structures of low symmetry corroles is a useful strategy for developing new HER catalysts.

Gas diffusion electrodes in fuel cells achieve highest utilization of precious metal catalysts by proper design of the porous electrode and the size of the catalyst particles. For highly porous catalytic coatings of gas evolving and gas consuming electrodes, eg Raney-nickel coated hydrogen evolving cathodes as well as for gas diffusion electrodes, slow diffusive mass transfer of the dissolved gases in the electrolyte limits the utilization of the nanoporous catalyst particles, the number of merit for the porous structures being the electrochemical Thiele modulus. Decreasing the particle size, ie matching the size/thickness of porous catalyst particles/coatings to their intrinsic catalytic activity and the applied current density allows to diminish the Thiele modulus and to increase catalyst utilization to the highest possible degree.

However, inherent problems including poor rate performance, continuous capacity degradation, and voltage fading hinder their commercial utilization. Herein, a lattice- and interfacial-modified Li1.2Mn0.54Co0.13Ni0.13O2 with a pristine-layered bulk structure, Na- and S-doped transition phase, and epitaxially grown Na2Mn (SO4)(2) (C2/c symmetry) layer were constructed by Na2S treatment. The monoclinic Na2Mn(SO4)(2) not only acts as an interface protective layer, alleviating the harmful electrode-electrolyte reactions, but also promotes formation of oxygen vacancy in the layered structure, enhancing reversibility of oxygen redox. The Na and S surface lattice doping leads to enhanced Li+ diffusion and alleviates the chance of oxygen release. With the positive effects provided by the stable interfacial layer and lattice modification, the modified cathodes with moderate Na2S treatment shows alleviated capacity and voltage decay and enhanced electrochemical kinetics. Especially, the washed cathode with 3 wt % Na2S treatment delivers a discharge specific capacity of 305 at 0.1 C and 219 mA h g(-1) at 1 C, as well as 93.15% capacity retention and 88.20% voltage retention after 200 cycles at 1 C.									14	1	0	0	1	0	15			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000575557800021	32878431

The F-doped -Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction, achieving a low onset potential (260 mV), high mass activity (69.1 A g(-1) at = 350 mV) and low Tafel slope (31.89 mV dec(-1)), which are superior to those of commercial RuO2 catalysts. Simultaneously, F-doped -Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets are found to have a high specific capacitance of 158.75 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) with a maximum energy density of 67.4 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 400 W kg(-1), which could still retain 40 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 16 kW kg(-1). DFT calculations rationalize that F doped -Ni(OH)(2) favors electrical conductivity, efficient electron transport and water adsorption. It could be envisioned that the proposed simple and efficient approach will pave a new way to synthesize other anion doped 2D materials for energy conversion and storage technology.									57	8	0	0	3	0	59			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000467249200023

However, their fabrication presents great challenges. Herein, for the first time we show that layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly on 3-D substrates can be employed to controllably fabricate 3-D composite electrodes. Ni foam (NF) supported poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI)/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) multilayers fabricated via this approach have tunable catalytic properties. The optimum one achieves the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 322 mV, which is lower than those of most reported transition metal-based OER catalysts and non-metal ones as well as those of state-of-the-art Ir/C, Ru/C, IrO2/C, and RuO2 measured under the same conditions (0.1 M KOH). It shows a Tafel slope of 78 mV dec (-1), which is among the lowest reported for transition metal-based OER catalysts and non-metal ones and comparable to or even lower than that of state-of-the-art Ir and Ru-based ones measured in 0.1 M KOH. In addition, this electrode exhibits a potential increase from 0.55 V to 0.58 V vs. SCE after 18.8 h of chronopotentiometry testing at 10 mA cm (-2) and retains 85.8% of the current density at 1.0 V vs. SCE after 350 CV cycles, revealing its good stability. The high catalytic performance could be attributed to in situ formed Ni(OH)(2) with RGO-promoted activity, high-density C] O rich edge-exposed RGO nanosheets, and the covalently crosslinked multilayer structure of chemically stable RGO nanosheets. All of these properties arise from synergistic interactions between NF, PEI, and RGO. This work offers a facile, mild, controllable, and economical strategy to synergistically assemble conventional poor OER catalysts for low-cost, highly active, and durable 3-D OER electrodes. It also provides scientific insight into the mechanism for the superior and tunable OER catalytic activity, which is critical for further improving the OER catalytic performance.									23	1	0	0	1	0	24			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000394430800041

Under optimized conditions, DHA with high selectivity up to 45% and a high production rate of 9.6 mu mol h-1 cm-2 is obtained at high current density over 3 mA cm-2 without the occurrence of the oxygen evolution reaction. Operando Raman spectroscopy features the potential-induced structural transformation between CoOx and oxyhydroxides from which a correlation among applied potential, surface chemistry of electrocatalyst, and product distribution are built. These results point toward the viability of using inexpensive materials for electrochemical biomass upgrading as well as providing opportunities for studying structural evolution and activity origin of catalysts under realistic working conditions that can be widely extended to most electrocatalytic biomass valorization processes.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000706416400004

However, when assembled on various substrates, isolated Pt single atoms are often demonstrated to proceed through the two-electron ORR pathway due to the unfavorable OO bond cleavage thermodynamics in the absence of catalytic ensemble sites. In addition, although their distinct local coordination environments at the exact single active sites are intensively explored, the interactions and synergy between closely neighboring single atom sites remain elusive. Herein, atomically dispersed Pt monomers strongly interacting on a Mo2C support is demonstrated as a model catalyst in the four-electron ORR, and the beneficial interactions between two closely neighboring and yet non-contiguous Pt single atom sites (named as quasi-paired Pt single atoms) are shown. Compared to isolated Pt single atom sites, the quasi-paired Pt single atoms deliver a superior mass activity of 0.224 A mg(Pt)(-1) and near-100% selectivity toward four-electron ORR due to the synergistic interaction from the two quasi-paired Pt atom sites in modulating the binding mode of reaction intermediates. Our first-principles calculations reveal a unique mechanism of such quasi-paired configuration for promoting four-electron ORR.									11	1	0	0	1	0	11				2198-3844		WOS:000673405500001	34258886

We prepared a free-standing, anion-conducting and stable polyaniline (PAni) membrane, where the central secondary and two terminal tertiary amine groups act as gel inhibitors. The prepared alkaline membranes were used as substrates for loading an electrocatalyst and fabricating the membrane electrode assembly (MEA). Nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) is generally considered a promising candidate for the OER, but has morphology-dependent bi-functional catalytic activity for overall water splitting that prompted us to develop the hollow spherical-structured NiCo(2)O(4)for simultaneous OER and HER in alkaline media. The reported electrocatalyst achieved 10 mA cm(-2)current density at 1.63 V for the OER, and 0.24 V for the HER. The fabricated MEA showed better overall water splitting performance for the PAni-1.03 membrane in comparison with commercially available membranes, and good durability for alkaline water electrolysis at 50 degrees C under an applied current density of 200 mA cm(-2). Further, the proposed highly conducting and stable alkaline membrane electrolyser may be a turning point for efficient water splitting in alkaline media for O-2/H(2)evolution.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000562931300026

Herein, a bifunctional catalyst comprising Co nanoparticles uniformly embedded in hollow nitrogen doped carbon tubes (Co@hNCTs) is fabricated by a facile tube-directed templating strategy. In this strategy, surfactant-treated polypyrrole (PPy) nanotubes serve as the structure-guiding templates for efficient capture of Co2+, realizing the in-situ growth of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-67 (ZIF-67) nanocrystals on PPy nanotubes. Sodium laurylsulfonate acts as anionic surfactant to endow PPy nanotubes with functional electronegative surface and strong anchoring effect toward ZIF-67, playing the pivotal role in binding of ZIF-67 nanocrystals with PPy nanotubes potently. Consequently, the developed catalyst presents a superior ORR activity with the half-wave potential of 0.87 V excellent durability with only a 7 mV loss of half-wave potential after 5000 cycles. The catalyst also exhibits superior catalytic performance for OER. When serving as an air electrode in Zn-air batteries, a large power density of 149 mW cm(-2) and long-term cyclability for over 500 h are realized in ambient air, implying the great potential in practical application.									109	5	0	0	6	0	110			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000530670200013

In the present work, thecarbon nanotubes (CNTs) sheathed in lead hybrid anode has been fabricated through electrochemical codeposition, and its electrochemical performances under zinc electrowinning condition have been discussed extensively. It is also the first time to coat CNTs by Pb with tunable method via metal oxide. The CNTs/Pb composite anode shows ten times larger exchange current density and electrochemically active surface areas (ECSA) than those ofpure Pb, which indicates an extra high electro-catalytic activity. The lower overpotential and polarization resistance of the CNTs/Pb composite anode for oxygen evolution are due to integrity for efficient charge transport between matrix and PbO2 by penetrating through PbO layer. Under industrial condition of current density 500Am(-2), the overpotential can be decreased by about 120mV compared with pure Pb during the long-term durability test. Moreover, the hybrid anode comprising similar to 0.6wt% CNTs is also cost effective. The CNTs/Pb composite anode can be a promising and cost-effective anode in harsh high acidic condition and potentially applied in zinc electrowinning practice due to high hardness andscalable production.[GRAPHICS].									8	4	0	0	0	0	11			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000456211400007

The effects of La substitution on the oxygen ion diffusion and oxygen catalysis in A-site La-substituted BFO are studied by combining data-driven molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The data-driven MD simulations are capable of providing atomic level information regarding oxygen jumps at different sites, bridging the resolution gap of analysis between MD and DFT. The simulations identify several effects due to the introduction of La. First, according to simple electroneutrality considerations and DFT calculations, La tends to decrease the concentration of oxygen vacancies in BFO. Second, La substitution lowers the activation energy of local oxygen migration, providing faster paths for oxygen diffusion. The MD analysis predicts a higher hopping rate through La-containing bottlenecks as well as easier oxygen jumps from the La-rich cages and lower dwell times of oxygen in those cages. DFT calculations confirm a lower migration energy through La-containing bottlenecks. Third, the electrocatalytic activity of the material decreases with La, as indicated by a lower O p-band center and higher oxygen vacancy formation energies.									33	1	0	0	2	0	33			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000361543200035	26313519

However, concentrated research towards the development of efficient inexpensive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst holds the pivotal role in realizing the hydrogen economy. In this context, for the first time N-graphene supported Pd (Pd/NG) was synthesised and employed as an HER catalyst in ECMR process. N-graphene was synthesised by modified Hummer's method followed by Pd deposition through hydrothermal route. The electrocatalytic activity of Pd/ NG for hydrogen evolution was evaluated by CV and LSV techniques. Tafel slope of Pd/NG and Pt/C was calculated from LSV curves and was found to be 33 and 31 mV/decade, respectively. Exchange current density was found to be 3.6 and 3.2 x 10(-4) A cm(-2) for Pd and Pt catalysts, respectively. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity is majorly attributed to the N-doping and uniform distribution of Pd nano particles on graphene. Further, the performance of Pd/NG was also evaluated in single ECMR cell using Pt-Ru/C at anode and Pd/NG at cathode as electrocatalysts. The results indicated the suitability of Pd/NG as cathode electrocatalyst for HER in ECMR process. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The proeutectoid and eutectoid transformation behaviors of FeO were discussed in terms of thermodynamics and oxygen depletion or enrichment in FeO. The isothermal transformation of FeO was divided into two stages, or the occurrence of proeutectoid precipitation of Fe3O4 followed by the eutectoid transformation of FeOrarrFe+Fe3O4. The eutectic reaction kinetics from FeO can be controlled by changing coiling temperature, and the oxide structures can be controlled.

The molecular level is mainly considered in the lecture. The greatest progress to date has been made in relation to the opsin visual pigments. Opsins appeared before eyes did. Two- and three-dimensional organization for rhodopsin in the rod outer segment disk membrane, as well as molecular mechanisms of visual pigments spectral tuning, photoisomerization and also opsin as a G-protein coupled receptor are considered. Molecular mechanisms of visual pigments spectral tuning, namely switching of chromophore (physiological time scale) and amino acid changes in the chromophore site of opsin (evolutionary time scale) is considered in the lecture. Photoisomerization of rhodopsin chromophore, 11-cis retinal is the only photochemical reaction in vision. The reaction is extemely fast (less that 200 fs) and high efficient (. is 0.65). The rhodopsin photolysis and kinetics of the earlier products appearance, photo- and bathorhodopsin, is considered. It is known that light is not only a carrier of information, but also a risk factor of damage to the eye. This photobiological paradox of vision is mainly due to the nature of rhodopsin chromophore. Photooxidation is the base of the paradox. All factors present in the phototrceptor cells to initiate free-radical photooxidation: photosensitizers, oxygen and substrates of oxidation: lipids and proteins (opsin). That is why photoprotective system of the eye structures appeared in the course of evolution. Three lines of protective system to prevent light damage to the retina and retina pigment epithelium is known: permanent renewal of rod and cone outer segment, powerful antioxidant system and optical media as cut-off filters where the lens is a key component. The molecular mechanisms of light damage to the eye and photoprotective system of the eye is considered in the lecture. The molecular mechanisms of phototransduction in vertebrates eye is also briefly considered in the lecture. Evolution of vision is an enormous subject for thought and investigation. In the postgenomic era evolutionary molecular physiology as a whole and evolutionary molecular physiology of vision can be considered as a key approach for understanding how genome is working.

In our paper, carbon defective carbon nitride (V-g-C3N4) with a large specific surface area (555.3 m(2) g(-1)) was prepared by multiple thermal and oxygen etching using urea as a precursor. The photocatalytic performance of the materials was evaluated by synthetic ammonia under visible light and full spectrum. Under visible light, V-g-C3N4 can produce 3.60 mmol/h/g of NH3, which is approximately similar to 3.24 times higher than that of g-C3N4. Under the sunlight, V-g-C3N4 can produce 21.35 mmol/h/g of NH3. Particularly, positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) was used to confirm the type of vacancies. The experimental results show that the method of multiple calcinations not only can successfully introduce the carbon vacancy into the polymerization network structure of carbon nitride, resulting in a large number of active sites are added for the reaction of ammonia synthesis, but also can expand the bandgap from 2.82 eV to 3.03 eV. In addition, After g-C3N4 was exposed to high temperature and weak oxygen three times, its structure became loose and porous, which also provides more active sites for the reaction. Herein, these findings provide a novel concept of introducing carbon vacancies to promote the efficiency of photocatalytic ammonia synthesis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000718807500004

In this context, hydrogen is a clean, renewable, energetically efficient fuel with infinite potential for the future, which can generate a large amount of energy through the electrocatalytic splitting of earth-abundant water resources. Noble metals, owing to their extraordinary efficiency and stability, are state-of-the-art catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process. However, their scarcity and high cost hamper their commercialization. To replace these expensive noble-metal-based materials, researchers are extensively working on the development of cost effective, stable, conductive, and efficient non-noble metal based materials such as transition metal oxides, borides, nitrides, sulfides, phosphides, selenides, perovskites oxides, and layered double hydroxides, where the incorporation of heteroatoms improves the electrocatalytic activity by modifying the electronic structure and enhances the conductivity and stability. In the case of transition-metal based metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and MOF-derived materials, the unique structure of MOFs with a high surface area and porosity, as well as rich redox chemistry of transition metals, leads to excellent response towards the OER process. Moreover, direct utilization of carbonaceous materials or making their composites with transition metals not only enhances the conductivity due to their conductive nature but also promotes stability by strongly binding with the electrocatalyst. Owing to the presence of functional groups on the surface or through different interactions, they provide multiple paths for facile electron and ion transport due to the sheet/network like structure, which help in the fine dispersion of electrocatalyst due to high surface area, prevent agglomeration, and in turn results in improved electrocatalytic activity. Besides these advances, a) there is still a need for a thorough understanding of reaction mechanism via in situ spectroscopic techniques to further optimize the composition and design of electrocatalyst to get desired results, b) the stability of the materials should be further enhanced to practically utilize synthesized material under harsh conditions without degradation, and c) the utilization of these optimized OER catalysts in a solar cell to consume solar energy (renewable energy source), remains a key requirement of the modern era.									29	1	0	0	0	0	29			2196-0216			WOS:000603332400001		
J	RICHTER, M; BOTHIN, B; WILD, A								THE DIFFERENTIAL EFFECT OF PHOTOINHIBITION ON THE QUANTUM YIELD OF OXYGEN EVOLUTION AND ON THE ELECTRON-TRANSPORT CAPACITY STUDIED WITH ISOLATED SPINACH THYLAKOIDS								PHOTOSYNTHETICA				27	1-2			191	200						1992	1992	The light response changes of oxygen evolution in the isolated spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) thylakoids associated with the photoinhibition, influenced by the temperature and radical protection, were determined. Photoinhibition was performed at 20-degrees-C with or without an addition of antioxidant mixture consisting of glutathione, ascorbate, superoxide dismutase and catalase, or, alternatively, at 0-degrees-C without the antioxidants. Beside the effects on decline of atrazine binding sites and variable room temperature fluorescence, the three variants of photoinhibition differed with respect to their effects on the yield of oxygen evolution. Quantum yield of oxygen evolution (phi(O2)) decline preceded the decrease of electron transport capacity at the beginning, while similar low values were found at the end of the treatment. In the presence of antioxidants the electron transport capacity remained high, whereas marked decline of phi(O2) occurred with the equally treated thylakoids. Comparable deviating behaviour of phi(O2) and the electron transport capacity was not found following photoinhibition at 0-degrees-C; both were affected to the same degree, regardless if ferricyanide or the Q(B)-independent electron acceptor silicomolybdate were used. With isolated thylakoids the quotient F(v)/F(m), which is often used as z measure for photochemical efficiency of open photosystem 2 reaction centres in whole plant studies, did not decline to the same extent as phi(O2) under the different photoinhibitory conditions applied. The main conclusion is that in thylakoid photoinhibition the independent mechanisms are associated with the changes of both the phi(O2) and electron transport capacity, and that the phi(O2)-related mechanism is inhibited at 0-degrees-C.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0300-3604	1573-9058		WOS:A1992MC74500017

High performance in electrolysis and fuel cell mode was obtained for samples using LSCF (lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite) and LSM/YSZ electrodes. AC impedance experiments performed under different potential loads reveal the reversibility for both electrodes.

J	Yang, Xiaobing; Chen, Juan; Yang, Weishen; Lin, Hao; Luo, Xuetao								Influence of Zn and Co co-doping on oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysis at MOF-derived N-doped carbon electrodes								INORGANIC CHEMISTRY FRONTIERS				6	12			3475	3481		10.1039/c9qi00334g				DEC 1 2019	2019	Electrochemical conversion of water into oxygen and hydrogen gas is a highly efficient method to meet the energy requirement on a global scale and solve the global warming problem arising from the mass consumption of fossil sources. Therefore, it is important to develop a catalyst with excellent oxygen reduction reaction (OER) activity. In this paper, we adopted the cocrystallization technology to synthesize Zn1-xCox-ZIF composites. Then, the Zn1-xCox-ZIF composites were used as precursors to prepare the Zn1-xCox/NC electrocatalyst (NC is N-doped carbon). The influence of the Zn element on the Zn1-xCox/NC electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction has been explored. All as-prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results show that Zn1-xCox/NC electrocatalysts exhibit excellent OER activity. And the doping of Zn has a great influence on the structure and OER efficiency of the Zn1-xCox/NC electrocatalyst. After the pyrolysis process, the organic ligands of Zn1-xCox-ZIF are transformed into porous carbon and Zn and Co nanoparticles are formed inside the carbon. Among these Zn1-xCox/NC electrocatalysts, Zn0.2Co0.8/NC shows the highest OER activity. The carbon nanowires appearing on the surface of Zn0.2Co0.8/NC nanoparticles are much more compared to that on others. The overpotential and Tafel slope of Zn0.2Co0.8/NC are 1.52 V and 98 eV dec(-1), respectively. Zn0.2Co0.8/NC also exhibits outstanding long-term electrochemical durability. This finding can not only extend the application of MOFs, but can also present a new method for fabricating highly efficient OER electrocatalysts.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2052-1553			WOS:000501285400006

The fabrication of Co3S4/CeO2-CF was confirmed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). It is observed that CeO2 nanorod was fully covered with Co3S4 nanosheets, forming a hierarchical core-shell nanostructure. Furthermore, CeO2 and Co3S4 were doped with each other during the one-step hydrothermal process, forming a heterogeneous Co3S4/CeO2 nanostructure. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the introduction of CeO2 in Co3S4 is effective in reducing the free energy barrier of OER process. To achieve current density of 10 mA cm-2, only small overpotentials of 74.9 mV and 213 mV are required for HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH solution, respectively. In particular, the Co3S4/CeO2-CF based electrolysis cell for overall water splitting only needs an output voltage of 1.64 V in the alkaline medium, lower than that of Pt/C-RuO2-based electrolysis cells (1.70 V). Such hierarchical heterogeneous catalyst also shows ultra-stable catalytic activity. Therefore, with the favorable heterointerfaces and hierarchical structures, Co3S4/CeO2-CF could be a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting and this study may also provide a facile method for the preparation of hierarchical heterogeneous nanostructured materials.

However, poor electrical conductivity and easy detachment of the POMs from the electrode cause significant challenges under operating condition. Herein, a simple one-step hydrothermal method is reported to synthesize a series of Dexter-Silverton POM/Ni foam composites (denoted as NiM-POM/Ni; M=Co, Zn, Mn), in which the stable linkage between the POM catalysts and the Ni foam electrodes lead to high activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Among them, the highest HER performance can be observed in the NiCo-POM/Ni, featuring an overpotential of 64 mV (at 10 mA cm(-2), vs. reversible hydrogen electrode), and a Tafel slope of 75 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 m aqueous KOH. Moreover, the NiCo-POM/Ni catalyst showed a high faradaic efficiency approximate to 97 % for HER. Post-catalytic of NiCo-POM/Ni analyses showed virtually no mechanical or chemical degradation. The findings propose a facile and inexpensive method to design stable and effective POM-based catalysts for HER in alkaline water electrolysis.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000493861400001	31536174

This method represents an eco-friendly mechanochemical process that can be easily adapted for industrial-scale productivity and allows both the exfoliation of graphite and the synthesis of large quantities of functionalized graphene. These materials are characterized by transmission and scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetry measurements, X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopy, and then, are tested towards the oxygen reduction reaction by cyclic voltammetry and rotating disk electrode methods. Their responses towards ORR are analysed in correlation with their properties and use for the best ORR catalyst identification. However, even though the mechanochemical procedure and the characterization techniques are clean and green methods (i.e., water is the only solvent used for these syntheses and investigations), they are time consuming and, generally, a low number of materials can be prepared, characterized and tested. In order to eliminate some of these limitations, the use of regression learner and reverse engineering methods are proposed for facilitating the optimization of the synthesis conditions and the materials' design. Thus, the machine learning algorithms are applied to data containing the synthesis parameters, the results obtained from different characterization techniques and the materials response towards ORR to quickly provide predictions that allow the best synthesis conditions or the best electrocatalysts' identification.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1420-3049		WOS:000671117800001	34202753

The morphology, crystalline phases, and nanostructure of the alumina/NCN electrode were characterized. The electrocatalytic activity of this elelctrode toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solutions was investigated. The electrocatalytic activity analyzed by cyclic voltammetry exhibited the onset potential for HER shifted in the positive direction favoring hydrogen generation with lower overpotential on the porous electrode, compared with pure carbon electrode. This behavior was attributed to the high porosity and electrochemical surface area as well as the nanostructure of the electrode that was pyrolyzed nano-carbon networks introduced into the alumina ceramic matrix, which can greatly enhance the electrode electrocatalytic activity toward HER. The associated kinetic parameters of HER were systematically investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To investigate their electrocatalytic activities, glassy carbon electrodes (GCE) were modified by drop casting the catalyst ink without using any binder. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was used to test their electrocatalytic activities in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Among these catalysts, Ir/CeO2 was found to exhibit excellent activity and superior stability. According to the polarization curves, onset potential (eta(o)) and overpotential (eta@10 mA.cm(-2)) of Ir/CeO2 were found as -13 and -23 mV, respectively, which are lower than the values obtained for commercial 10% Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, Ir/CeO2 provides low Tafel slope (38.7 mV.dec(-1)), high turnover frequency (1.95 @100 mV) and high exchange current density (2.69 mA.cm(-2)) values. In addition, Ir/CeO2 shows superior stability even after 20 000 cycle in acidic environment (pH = 0.3) which makes Ir/CeO2 (2.44 wt% Ir) as a promising alternative electrocatalyst for HER.

Spontaneous nanophase separation of Ru2Ce in an oxidative atmosphere results in a lamellar nanocomposite consisting of Ru metal and cerium oxide (CeO2). Selective leaching of the Ru-CeO(2)nanocomposite in sulfuric acid yields np-Ru with a high surface area of 48 m(2)g(-1), predominantly surrounded by reaction active {10110} facets. Active-faceted np-Ru efficiently catalyzed the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media at an overpotential of +74 mVvs.the reversible hydrogen electrode, which is 20 mV lower than that for carbon-supported Ru (Ru/C) and rather close to +58 mV for state-of-the-art Pt/C. Np-Ru has great potential in broad applications such as hydrogen battery electrodes because of its low HER overpotential and scalable synthetic protocol.									10	1	0	0	1	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000575366700005

The oxidation reaction of small silver clusters between Ag-9 and Ag-55 is monitored by means of their localized surface plasmon resonance. We observe a rapid decline of the SH-intensity, as soon as cluster samples are exposed to an oxygen partial pressure of 5.10(-6) mbar, which is attributed to the formation of silver-oxygen-bonds. The evolution of the SH-intensity under exposure to oxygen shows a double-exponential character for all investigated cluster sizes. Since the oxidation of single crystalline silver surfaces follow single-exponential Langmuir-kinetics, the two independent pathways of SH-intensity loss are attributed to a surface- and an interface-oxidation of supported clusters, respectiveley. For small cluster sizes, a complete loss of the SH intensity is obtained, which suggests the complete oxidation of the clusters. For larger clusters a plasmonic resonance is still observed after oxidation, indicating a residual free-electron density.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1040-7278	1572-8862		WOS:000410837600002

With this process, MoSe2 nanosheets can be uniformly and tightly deposited on this flexible conductor to form a 3D binder-free electrode for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The film thickness can also be controlled by the EPD time. Directly used as binder-free electrodes for hydrogen evolution reaction, the as-prepared 3D MoSe2/CC samples exhibit excellent catalytic activity in an acidic electrolyte (21 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of 250 mV). Variation of MoSe2 nanosheets film thickness in the electrodes could affect the catalytic activity, and it was found that the MoSe2/CC sample prepared with 60 min EPD time shows the highest HER activity amongst these different thickness samples. Moreover, stability tests though long-term potential cycles (no degradation after 1000 continuous potential cycles) and extended electrolysis confirm the exceptional durability of the catalyst. This development offers us an attractive and active 3D electrode for electrochemical water splitting.									73	3	0	0	6	0	73			2045-2322			WOS:000371405600001	26948283	
J	ELEID, MF								CNO ISOTOPES IN RED GIANTS - THEORY VERSUS OBSERVATIONS								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				285	3			915	928						MAY 1994	1994	Evolutionary models in the mass range 1.7 to 15 M. having solar-like initial composition are presented. The models are calculated with the latest opacities and with the Schwarzschild criterion for convective instability. In test cases, core overshooting has been included in a parameterized way. Up-dated nuclear reactions have been used to follow the nucleosynthesis during the evolution which has been carried out beyond core He-burning at masses > 2 M.. The 2 M. model has been evolved through the core He-flash. The resulting surface CNO isotopic ratios after the first and second dredge-up phases are compared with observations of field giants as well as with data obtained for galactic open clusters. A comparison between recent theoretical predictions of these ratios is also presented. The goal of this work is twofold: (i) to test mass estimations of the observed giants on the basis of the predicted surface abundance ratios of C-12/C-13, O-16/O-17 and O-16/O-18, and the evolutionary tracks, (ii) to show that O-16/O-17 ratio obtained in giant models at M> 2 M. is rather sensitive to the still uncertain O-17(p, alpha)N-14 reaction.The main results of the present work are as follows: (i) our one-dimensional dynamical calculations show that the 2 M. model survives the core He-flash, (ii) we are able to estimate the masses of 6 observed giants out of 11. In addition, the supergiant star a Sco is well described by a model of initially 15 M.. (iii) the observed low C-12/C-13 ratios in many giants with M> 2 M. cannot be explained in terms of a simple dredge-up scenario or by the variation of the initial value. These ratios are barely influenced by the effect of ''moderate'' overshooting, (iv) We find that the calculated Na enrichment resulting from the Ne-Na cycle does not match the values suggested by current observations.									91	0	0	0	0	0	91			0004-6361			WOS:A1994NP63400024

The active MnOOH species, that is, Mn4+/Mn3+ redox couple and Bronsted acid sites on the mesoporous ZSM-5 matrix facilitate an approximately 4e(-) process for the catalysis of the ORR comparable to commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. Stable electrocatalytic activity with 90% current retention after 5000 cycles, and more importantly, excellent methanol tolerance is observed. Synergetic catalytic effects between the MnO2 nanorods and the mesoporous ZSM-5 matrix are proposed to account for the high electrochemical catalytic performance.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000378634800014	27038172

This article reports an experimental investigation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the expression of genes associated with extracellular electron transfer (EET) in methanogenic biocathodes. The MEC-AD systems were examined using two cathode materials: carbon fibers and stainless-steel mesh. A higher abundance of hydrogenotrophic Methanobacterium sp. and homoacetogenic Acetobacterium sp. appeared to play a major role in superior methanogenesis from stainless steel biocathode than carbon fibers. Moreover, the higher secretion of EPS accompanied by the lower ROS level in stainless steel biocathode indicated that higher EPS perhaps protected cells from harsh metabolic conditions (possibly unfavorable local pH) induced by faster catalysis of hydrogen evolution reaction. In contrast, EET-associated gene expression patterns were comparable in both biocathodes. Thus, these results indicated hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is the key mechanism, while cathodic EET has a trivial role in distinguishing performances between two cathode electrodes. These results provide new insights into the efficient methanogenic biocathode development.									15	2	0	0	12	0	16			2045-2322			WOS:000640434400066	33846480

However, its application is still limited by excessive bulk carrier recombination and sluggish surface oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. Taking SnS2 as an example, a promising layered optoelectronic semiconductor, Ar plasma treatment strategy was used to introduce a SnS/SnS2 P-N heterojunction and O-S bond near the surface of a SnS2 nanosheet array, simultaneously increasing the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in the bulk and lowering the OER overpotential at the surface. The onset potential of the plasma-treated SnS2 nanosheet array shifts negatively to 0.16 V, and the photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs. RHE boosts to 2.15 mA cm(-2), which is 7 times that of pristine SnS2. This work demonstrates a facile plasma treatment strategy to modulate the energy band structure and surface chemical states for improved PEC performance.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000487778900001	31507028

Herein, we synthesize a stable electrocatalyst of N,S-atom-coordinated Co9S8 trinary dopants within a porous graphene framework (Co9S8@NS-3DrGO), in which Co9S8 nanoparticles show uniform sizes and distributions. The stable Co9S8-based composites are fabricated by a facile soft template-assisted strategy, and the attraction of this method is that the intermediate of melamine formaldehyde resin (MFR) plays trifunctional roles, including (i) it acts as the templated bonding material to crosslink GO sheets together, (ii) it facilitates the formation of a core-shell architecture, and (iii) it acts as the N source for doping. Catalyst composition and performance are largely dependent on the pyrolysis temperature. Extensive investigation elucidates that the mechanism of electrocatalytic activity is attributed to: (i) the unique core-shell structure of the composites, as well as uniform particle sizes and distributions of Co9S8, (ii) the active nitrogen (pyridinic N and graphitic N) contents, and (iii) the large surface area and porous architecture. The composite pyrolyzed at 850 degrees C exhibits the best electrocatalytic performance, which shows a positive ORR half-wave potential (0.826 V), a small OER overpotential (317 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2), and high stability, comparable to the commercial noble catalysts Pt/C and RuO2 in alkaline media. Furthermore, when applied in zinc-air batteries, it also displays a comparable performance to a Pt/C + RuO2 mixture catalyst. This work provides an approach to stabilize cobalt sulfides and control their particle sizes and distributions by ingeniously employing the soft template of MFR and pyrolyzing them at various temperatures.									28	1	0	0	0	0	28			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000449696200022	30302488

The stabilization has been interpreted to indicate that photoinhibited PSII centres protect the remaining active centres against photoinhibition (Lee, Hong and Chow, Planta 212:332-342, 2001). In an attempt to study the mechanism of this protection, we measured the reaction kinetics of photoinhibition in lincomycin-treated pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.) and pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) leaves in vivo. The light-saturated rate of PSII oxygen evolution, assayed from thylakoids and isolated from the treated leaves, was used as a direct measure of the number of remaining active PSII centres, and the fluorescence parameters F (V)/F (M) and (F (V)/F (M))/F (0) (=1/F (0) - 1/F (M)) were measured for comparison. To our surprise, no stabilization of PSII activity was observed and photoinhibition followed first-order kinetics until PSII activity had virtually declined to zero. A series of in vitro experiments was carried out to see whether stabilization of PSII activity occurs if a particular combination of light intensity and wavelength range is applied, or if a specific PSII preparation is used as experimental material. The results of the in vitro experiments confirmed the in vivo result about persistent first-order kinetics. We conclude that photoinhibited PSII centres offer no measurable protection against photoinhibition.									33	1	0	0	31	0	34			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000273165300002	19760110

The high hole-electron separation efficiency of photoanodes is highly required for real applications of photoanodes in sufficiently harvesting solar energy. Herein we show that the inactive g-C3N4 nanolayers can be self-assembled with BiVO4 into a highly coupled BV/CN dyad to significantly enhance the charge separation efficiency of BiVO4 photoelectrodes for the OER. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of visible light (400 nm) provided by the scalable BV/CN-5 photoanode was estimated to be 50% at 1.23 V vs. RHE in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution and significantly increased to 97% at a bias voltage of 1.6 V vs. RHE.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000411589300014	28890982

Herein, a simple and scale-up strategy is developed to synthesize a highly active and stable electrocatalyst (Co@N-CNT) through a solid-state thermal conversion process, derived from a single and easy-to-get precursor (cobaltic Prussian blue analogue). The Co particles trapped inside the tips are the growth sites of the carbon nanotubes and greatly improve the catalytic activity. This kind of special structure helps Co@N-CNT to achieve remarkable bifunctional activities comparable to the noble metal counterparts and superior durability. Interestingly, Co@N-CNT is proved to have no single-atom Co sites on the carbon nanotube. In combination with electrochemical tests, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, Co@graphitic N-C is considered to be the best ORR active site while Co@pyridinic N-C is the best OER active site.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2405-8297	2405-8289		WOS:000709762700002

This surface has two different terminations, one positively (A) and the other negatively charged (B). Dissociative water adsorption is preferred from low up to one monolayer coverage on the A termination and up to half monolayer on the B termination. On the latter, a mixed molecular and dissociated monolayer is more stable at full coverage. The computed structures are used to investigate the free-energy changes during water oxidation on both surface terminations. We find that the most difficult step of the oxygen evolution reaction is the second deprotonation to form an adsorbed O species (O*). Moreover, the A-terminated surface is more active than the B-terminated surface. Analysis of the surface electronic structure shows a larger density of cobalt states near the Fermi energy on the A termination, which stabilizes the O* species and thus reduces the overpotential.									83	3	0	0	6	0	86			1948-7185			WOS:000309505400013

Structural refining determines the space group of the series of114compounds to be P6_3mc,and structural analysis shows that the structure has obvious evolution trend with increasing doping amount. From YBaZn_3GaO_7 to ScBaZn_3GaO,the cell parameter decreases linearly.

The results show that, high temperature weakens the CSH structure, including the stretching of Si-O bonds, the decomposition of silicate chains, and the hydrolysis weakening caused by water molecules. The high kinetic energy and weakened structure result in the melting and diffusion of CSH gel. However, the incorporation of GO can effectively stabilize the CSH structure by following three factors. (1) GO prevents the diffusion of the gel, and the packing of gel on the GO nanosheet increases the compatibility between them. (2) Reduction reaction of GO creates the defects on the carbon plane, providing the space for silicate chains crossing GO sheet. (3) Frequency exchange of oxygen between GO and CSH promotes the formation of chemical bonding between them. The improvement of the stability of CSH gel can effectively reduce the ablation velocity under high temperature.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0927-0256	1879-0801		WOS:000506172700012

Building the alkaline hybrid zinc batteries (AHZBs) combining ZAB and alkaline zinc/cobalt batteries (ZCB) at the battery level can supply an effective strategy to solve these problems. In this work, we fabricate a self-supported Mn-Co spinel electrode (named as MnCo2O4) with the porous nanofiber morphology by a facile hydrothermal method and assemble AHZB. Thanks to the large electrochemical active surface area and appropriate ratio of Co2+/Co3+, the as-prepared MnCo2O4 electrode shows both the high bifunctional oxygen catalytic activities for ZABs and metal ion redox properties for ZCBs. AHZB with the self -supported MnCo2O4 electrode possesses two voltage platforms in both charge and discharge processes due to the oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (OER/ORR) ZABs and metal ion redox reaction in ZCBs. Besides of the highly power density and excellent cyclic stability, the charge-discharge efficiency of our AHZB with the self-supported MnCo2O4 electrode can reach 86.2%, almost being the highest value in the recent works. Our work supplies a viable strategy for developing high-performance ZABs with improved discharge voltage and charge-discharge efficiency. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

A commercial-grade unpurified Ar gas with P-O2 = approximate to 10(-4) bar and a purified Ar gas with P-O2 = approximate to 10(-18) bar by a set of cleaning kits are employed. Preliminary thermodynamic calculations revealed that the unpurified Ar gas could cause significant oxidation of the Ti-ULC steel, irrespective of the steel composition, while the purified Ar gas did not oxidize the steel. A series of laboratory-scale oxidation experiments are carried out using various Ti-ULC steel samples and the two Ar gases. The oxidation under unpurified Ar gas causes the oxidation of all the samples but only on the surface, in partial agreement with the thermodynamic calculation. The partial agreement between the calculation and the experiment is explained by the availability of oxygen and other metallic elements. It is found that the trace of oxygen in a commercial grade of Ar gas could cause reoxidation of Ti-ULC steel in an SEN, which may be no better than the reoxidation by CO gas generated by the carbothermic reaction in the SEN refractory. A purity control of Ar gas is recommended.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1611-3683	1869-344X		WOS:000814096600001

However, the sluggish activity of the catalysts for alkaline water dissociation has hampered advances in highly efficient hydrogen production. Herein, we develop a single-atom platinum immobilized NiO/Ni heterostructure (Pt-SA-NiO/Ni) as an alkaline hydrogen evolution catalyst. It is found that Pt single atom coupled with NiO/Ni heterostructure enables the tunable binding abilities of hydroxyl ions (OH*) and hydrogen (H*), which efficiently tailors the water dissociation energy and promotes the H* conversion for accelerating alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. A further enhancement is achieved by constructing Pt-SA-NiO/Ni nanosheets on Ag nanowires to form a hierarchical three-dimensional morphology. Consequently, the fabricated Pt-SA-NiO/Ni catalyst displays high alkaline hydrogen evolution performances with a quite high mass activity of 20.6Amg(-1) for Pt at the overpotential of 100mV, significantly outperforming the reported catalysts. While H-2 evolution from water may represent a renewable energy source, there is a strong need to improve catalytic efficiencies while maximizing materials utilization. Here, authors examine single-atom Pt on nickel-based heterostructures as highly active electrocatalysts for alkaline H-2 evolution.									121	3	0	0	7	0	121			2041-1723			WOS:000665040300012	34145269

High cost and toxic elements can threaten the energy production. Only way to tackle the problem is that by utilizing the cost effective, earth-abundant and non toxic elements. In the present study, CuS, B-SnS and CuS@B-SnS nanocomposite were synthesized via co-precipitation process. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) spectra identify crystalline phases of synthesized samples. Raman spectra confirm nanocomposite formation and determine vibrational modes of molecules. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra revealed optical and electronic properties of synthesized materials. Flower-like morphology of CuS@beta SnS nanocomposite was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. In addition, CuS@beta-SnS nanocomposite exhibits 1111 F/g specific capacitance and 224 mV low overpotential. Further study revealed that CuS@beta-SnS nanocomposite electrocatalyst displays good stability and excellent OER activity even over a prolong time.

In this work, we fabricated self-supported composites of (Ni,Co)(3)C mesoporous nanosheets/N-doped carbon with adjustable sizes from 1 cm x 1 cm to 25 cm x 25 cm using a facile and rapid electrodeposition, which was then followed by carbonization. The as-prepared catalyst shows small overpotentials of 58, 118, and 71 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in acid, neutral, and basic electrolytes, respectively with high exchange current densities. The above HER activities exceeded most non-noble metal caride-based catalysts in a pH-universal electrolyte. Theoretical calculations suggest that bimetallic carbide is favorable for HER because of its metallic conductivity, close-to-zero Gibbs free energy change (Delta G(H)*), and downshifted dband center (epsilon(d)) revealed by density of states (DOS). The outstanding performance can be attributed to the tunable ultrathin nanosheet-like structure, large specific surface area, and electronic structure modulations. Our work developed an efficient, controllable, and large-scale synthesis of a cost-effective, highly efficient, high performance, and stable catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction, which can operate in a wide pH range.									23	1	0	0	1	0	23			2168-0485			WOS:000526363600033

Bismuth molybdate with its special layered structure in orthorhombic phase and hollow sphere morphology performed as potential electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline medium. The activity can further be enhanced by promoting iron in the crystal structure. The strain as well as dislocation developed in the crystal structure of Bi2MoO6 upon iron incorporation are well studied. The presence of optimum amount of iron and thereby creating oxygen vacancies have been found to be beneficial, though higher concentration turns out to be detrimental for the electrocatalytic performance. The optimum iron promoted Bi2MoO6 leads to achieve overpotential value of 286 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density with Tafel slope of only 44 mV dec(-1) for OER. The experimental results are well-supported by the density functional theory simulations, which demonstrate that iron incorporation lowers the energy barrier by promoting the adsorptions of OER intermediates, most distinctly the oxygen adsorption.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000713288800004

Black TiO2 shows different photocatalytic activities compared with white TiO2. However, the mechanism of photocatalytic reaction has not been clearly understood. Here, femtosecond time -resolved diffuse reflectance (fs-TRDR) spectroscopy and single-particle photoluminescence measurements were applied to gain better understanding about the relation between oxygen vacancy, charge transfer, lifetime of photogenerated charge, and photocatalytic activity. We prepared reduced TiO2 mesocrystals (R-TMC) through simple solid-state chemical reduction at moderate temperature 350 degrees C. R-TMC has nearly two times higher photocatalytic activity for H-2 production under solar light irradiation. The presence of oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ was studied by electro paramagnetic resonance and Xray photoelectron spectroscopy. This work confirms the findings of previous studies that enhancement of light absorption by formation of surface defects does not always lead to high photocatalytic activity. Femtosecond time -resolved diffuse reflectance (fs-TRDR) spectra reveal that proper concentration of oxygen vacancies enhances the charge separation of the photogenerated carriers, leading to high photocatalytic activity.									30	1	0	0	4	0	30			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000439003600014

The oxidation reaction of small silver clusters between and is monitored by means of their localized surface plasmon resonance. We observe a rapid decline of the SH-intensity, as soon as cluster samples are exposed to an oxygen partial pressure of mbar, which is attributed to the formation of silver-oxygen-bonds. The evolution of the SH-intensity under exposure to oxygen shows a double-exponential character for all investigated cluster sizes. Since the oxidation of single crystalline silver surfaces follow single-exponential Langmuir-kinetics, the two independent pathways of SH-intensity loss are attributed to a surface- and an interface-oxidation of supported clusters, respectiveley. For small cluster sizes, a complete loss of the SH intensity is obtained, which suggests the complete oxidation of the clusters. For larger clusters a plasmonic resonance is still observed after oxidation, indicating a residual free-electron density.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1040-7278	1572-8862		WOS:000414321100012

A hierarchically three-level nanostructure combining two types of mixed transition metal oxides on nickel foam (Ni-3(VO4)(2)@NiCo2O4/NF) has been synthesized through a two-step hydrothermal process. The hierarchically three level nanostructure comprises porous nickel foam as robust and conductive substrate in the bottom, vertical and uniform NiCo2O4 nanowires arrays in the intermediate, and top-coated Ni-3(VO4)(2) nanoparticles in 10 nm. The triple hierarchical nanostructure of Ni-3(VO4)(2)@NiCo2O4/NF is favorable for enlarging surface areas, exposing more active sites, promoting mass and charge transfer and accelerating HER process. Ni-3(VO4)(2)@NiCo2O4/NF electrode can afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a moderate overpotential of 113 mV with robust stability for at least 12 h. It may provide a new strategy to design triple hierarchical nanostructures based on earth-abundant transition metals to achieve large-scale production of hydrogen through water electrolysis in alkaline.

Particularly, the irradiation of the laterally spaced crystalline TiO2 nanotubes, results in the formation of the tight closure over irradiated end, preserving their hollow interior. The shape of the absorbance spectra is modulated along with applied energy, and the new absorption band appears at 500 nm, where the local minimum can be found for bare nanotubes. The high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectra indicate the presence of both metallic and hydroxide forms of nickel species. The electrode material treated with 355 nm pulses at 50 mJ cm(-2) shows significantly improved current densities in the anodic regime, reaching nearly 300 mA cm(-2) while exposed to solar radiation, whereas the untreated sample barely comes to 1.5 mA cm(-2) in the same conditions. The tailored titania photoanode also exhibits two orders of magnitude higher donor concentration in comparison to the primary substrate as verified by Mott-Schottky analysis. The electrochemical analysis confirms the key role of laser annealing in enhancing the effectiveness of light-driven water splitting.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2196-7350			WOS:000596768300001

In this work, an Fe-doped Co-11(HPO3)(8)(OH)(6) nanosheets array was fabricated on Ni foam via a one-step liquid-phase approach in the solvents of deionized water and isopropyl alcohol as such a bifunctional electrocatalyst. The different proton acceptors of hydroxyl and phosphite in Co-11(HPO3)(8)(OH)(6) nanosheets expedited the proton and electron transfer. The Fe dopant in Co-11(HPO3)(8)(OH)(6) adjusted the electronic structure of Co-11(HPO3)(8)(OH)(6), which significantly increased the hydrophilicity, conductivity, and active surface area. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed the Gibbs free energy of OER intermediates and H* adsorption energy in HER process were lowered, while the density of states (DOS) in the d-band center was increased by Fe doping, suggesting that Fe-doped Co-11(HPO3)(8)(OH)(6) is more active towards OER and HER processes. As a result, the optimized Fe-11.7%-Co-11(HPO3)(8)(OH)(6) shows outstanding activity, durability and robust structural stability toward both OER and HER in 1 M KOH electrolyte. For OER, it outputs 20 mA cm(-2) merely at an overpotential of 206 mV. Benefited from monolithically integrated nanosheets array structure on Ni foam, it can stably drive 500 mA cm(-2) at a fairly low overpotential of 268 mV. For HER, low overpotentials of 102 mV for 10 mA cm(-2) and 263 mV for 500 mA cm(-2) are acquired on Fe-11.7%-Co-11(HPO3)(8)(OH)(6). This offers a wateralkali electrolyzer by two Fe-11.7%-Co-11(HPO3)(OH)(6) electrodes implements a low cell voltage of 1.494 V for 10 mA cm(-2), and 1.772 V for 500 mA cm(-2) toward overall water electrolysis with striking stability. This work opens a promising avenue in exploring highly active and stable catalysts by transition metal phosphites with suitable element doping toward scale-up water electrolysis.

Herein, this study employs a simple mixing-calcination strategy to fabricate a high-performance bifunctional composite catalyst composed of N-doped graphitic carbon encapsulating Co nanoparticles (Co@NrC). Benefiting from the core-shell architectural and compositional advantages of favorable electronic configuration, more exposed active sites, sufficient electric conductivity, rich defects, and excellent charge transport, the optimal Co@NrC hybrid (Co@NrC-0.3) presents outstanding catalytic activity and stability toward oxygen-related electrochemical reactions (oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, i.e., ORR and OER), with a low potential gap of 0.766 V. Besides, the rechargeable liquid ZAB assembled with this hybrid electrocatalyst delivers a high peak power density of 168 mW cm(-2), a small initial discharge-charge potential gap of 0.45 V at 10 mA cm(-2), and a good rate performance. Furthermore, a relatively large power density of 108 mW cm(-2) is also obtained with the Co@NrC-0.3-based flexible solid-state ZAB, which can well power LED lights. Such work offers insights in developing excellent bifunctional electrocatalysts for both OER and ORR and highlights their potential applications in metal-air batteries and other energy-conversion/storage devices.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8				2637-9368		WOS:000771007200001

However, development of affordable oxygen catalysts with high eletrocatalytic activity and excellent durability is of critical importance for the implementation of rechargeable Zn-air batteries. Here, we report a novel synthesis of three-dimensional (3D) Co-N-C nanowire network (NN) and its remarkable electrocatalytic performance as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in rechargeable Zn-air batteries. The carbon nanowire network was derived from cost-effective cellulose, with Co and N heteroatom doping achieved by annealing the self-assembled MOF@aminemodified cellulose under N-2. As reported here, the best sample synthesized at 800 C, referred to as 3D Co-N-C NN-800, demonstrated an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) onset potential of 1.05 V and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 0.47 V (10 mA cm(-2)). As a result, a Zn-air battery assembled with 3D Co-N-C NN 800 demonstrates a small voltage gap of 0.8 V between charge and discharge and excellent durability, as evidenced by a minimal decay after 30 h operation (90 cycles, 15 mA cm(-2)). This study demonstrates a novel design strategy to enhance the electrcatalytic site and its homogeneity via the covalently bonded doping, which could be employed for the further development of bifunctional carbonaceous electrocatalysts.									30	5	0	0	2	0	31			2574-0962			WOS:000458705200020

Herein, we report the self-stacking of 2D nickel-cobalt (Ni-Co) phosphate nanoplates into 1D chainlike architectures with the assistance of metal glycerates as self-templates. This unique self-assembly process is driven by the adsorbed ethyl glycerate on the surface of the individual nanoplates, which promotes the subsequent growth of the new nanoplate on top of the previously formed nanoplate, thereby leading to the self-stacking of these nanoplates along the vertical direction. The flexibility of the proposed method is also highlighted by the feasible preparation of nickel phosphate with the same self-assembled structure. When tested as a catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline medium, the bimetallic Ni-Co phosphate (derived from Ni-Co-TEP) with the nanoplate-assembled chainlike structure displays much lower overpotential (eta(10) = 310 mV) and Tafel slope (68 mV dec(-1)) than its pristine counterparts. The enhanced OER activity of this bimetallic catalyst may be attributed to (i) the highly interconnected structure and the bimetallic composition which promote improved charge transport; (ii) the porous chainlike structure which provides increased number of active sites, facilitates easier electrolyte infiltration, and promotes good electrical contact with the electrolyte, and (iii) the presence of Ni3+ and Co3+ active sites (nickel-cobalt (oxy)hydroxides) which can promote the chemisorption of OH- and facilitate electron transfer from the OH- to the surface Ni/Co sites during OER.									76	3	0	0	0	1	76			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000566337800022

However, the design and fabrication of such catalysts are still highly challenging thus far. In this work, we fabricate a three-dimensional (3D) hybrid electrocatalyst by decorating N-doped graphene hydrogel film (NG) with molecular clusters (MoSx). This material has successfully combined the desired merits for electrocatalysis, such as highly active MoSx sites for HER, excellent mechanical properties for strong catalyst durability, highly hydrated framework for sufficient active site exposure as well as 3D conductive networks for fast charge transport. The 3D electrode shows a remarkable catalytic activity toward HER (140.6 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), which outperforms most graphene and/or MoSx-based electrocatalysts reported in the literature. Also, the catalyst electrode demonstrates favorable reaction kinetics (Tafel slope, 105 mV dec(-1)) and strong durability (seldom performance degradation after 12 h or 1000 cycles). Further mechanism study reveals that Volmer reaction is the dominant process on the 3D electrode and the dual active sites are highly probable during electrocatalytic process, that is, pyridinic/pyrrolic structures of N-doped graphene and defects/edges of MoSx are both active centers.

The easy cleavage of Si-O-Nb bonds was confirmed by infrared (IR) spectra, and Si-O-Ta bonds were broken at higher temperatures, suggesting the difference in energy between Si-O and O-M (M = Nb and Ta). The decomposition from T unit to D and Q units was analyzed by Si-29-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The redistribution due to the exchange reactions between Si-O and Si-C bonds was confirmed, which was also supported by thermogravimetric analysis-mass spectroscopy (TG-MS) results. Disiloxane and silane from the hybrid with Si-O-Nb bonds were detected at lower temperatures than those from the hybrids with Si-O-Ta or without Si-O-Nb bonds. The evolution temperature of these gases was close to the cleavage temperature of Si-O-Nb/Si-O-Ta bonds, which indicates that the cleavage of Si-O-Nb/Si-O-Ta bonds affects the redistribution.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			1882-0743	1348-6535		WOS:000186697100013

Critical to the feasibility of electrochemical NO3--to-NH3 technology is the development of cost-effective, scalable and selective catalysts that can produce NH3 with high yield. To this end, we design and constructure ultralow-content Pd (2.93 at%) in-situ incorporated Cu2O corner-etched octahedra (Pd-Cu2O CEO) with cavity and oxygen vacancy defects for selectively electrochemical NO3--to-NH3 transformation. The unique conner-etched cavity structure, rich surface oxygen vacancies, and Pd-Cu2O dual active sites, synergistically promote nitrate electroreduction undergo ammonia formation reaction pathway. Impressively, the as-made Pd-Cu2O CEO exhibited outstanding activity for electrocatalytic NO3--to-NH3, with high ammonia selectivity (95.31%) and Faradaic efficiency (96.56%). The developed hierarchical-defect strategy may open a new avenue for reasonable design of defect electrocatalysts to contribute desirable properties and functionalities in specific applications.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000820189200005

Designing appropriate active components and tailoring their microstructure are crucial to improve electrocatalytic performance. Herein, using metal organic framework (MOF) as template, novel Ni2P@C composites are prepared as bifunctional catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The best Ni2P@C-350 sample has a small onset overpotential (eta) of 57 mV, and up to 148 and 285 mV to afford 10 and 250 mA cm(-2) for HER. It only needs eta = 326 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, better than usual RuO2 electrode. Moreover, Ni2P@C-350||Ni2P@C-350 cell can work for overall water splitting more efficiently than common Pt/C||RuO2 cell, running stably within 30 h without obvious degradation. The excellent performance is attributed to its porous structure with easily accessible active sites, short ions transfer path, and superior structural stability, which enable a significant improvement on molecule level, e.g., the turnover frequency (TOF) of Ni2P@C-350 at eta = 250 mV is up to 0.84 s(-1), while that of pristine Ni2P is only 0.55 s(-1). These results highlight the effect of structure engineering, inspiring for electrode design of HER and OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-7350			WOS:000821633000001

In this work, NixSe (0.5 <= x <= 1) nanocrystals with different crystal structures and compositions have been controllably synthesized and investigated as potential electrocatalysts for multifunctional ORR, OER, and HER in alkaline conditions. A novel hot-injection process at ambient pressure was developed to control the phase and composition of a series of NixSe by simply adjusting the added molar ratio of the nickel resource to triethylenetetramine. Electrochemical analysis reveals that Ni0.5Se nanocrystalline exhibits superior OER activity compared to its counterparts and is comparable to RuO2 in terms of the low overpotential required to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (330 mV), which may benefit from the pyrite-type crystal structure and Se enrichment in Ni0.5Se. For the ORR and HER, Ni0.75Se nanoparticles achieve the best performance including lower overpotentials and larger apparent current densities. Further investigations demonstrate that Ni0.75Se could not only provide an enhanced electrochemical active area but also facilitate electron transfer during the electrocatalytic process, thus contributing to the remarkable catalytic activity. As a practical application, the Ni0.75Se electrode enables rechargeable Zn air battery with a considerable performance including a long cycling lifetime (200 cycles), high specific capacity (609 mA h g(-1) based on the consumed Zn), and low overpotential (0.75 V) at 10 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, the water splitting cell setup with an anode of Ni0.5Se for the HER and a cathode of Ni0.75Se for the OER exhibits a considerable performance with low decay in activity of 12.9% under continuous polarization for 10 h. These results suggest the promising potential of nickel selenide nanocrystals as earth-abundant and high-performance electrocatalysts for metal air batteries and alkaline water splitting.									83	8	0	0	6	0	85			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000431150900048	29616794

This paper describes a modest, low-cost, and feasible method to synthesize hierarchical structures of Co9S8 nanoparticles cocooned in the N-doped carbon layer (Co9S8-NDCL). First, the metal-organic framework, zeolitic imidazolate framework-67, was synthesized and then morphed into Co9S8-NDCL nanocomposites by thermal treatment with sulfur powder in an argon environment. The nanocomposite electrocatalyst boosts the efficient functioning in acidic (0.5 M sulfuric acid, H2SO4, pH = 0) and basic (1 M potassium hydroxide, KOH, pH = 14) conditions toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The improved electrocatalytic activity can be ascribed to the hierarchical, porous structure and synergy of Co9S8 nanoparticles and the N-doped carbon layer. The Co9S8-NDCL nanocomposite electrode attains the current density of 20 mA.cm(-2) for the HER, requiring very low overpotentials of 149 and 219 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH aqueous solutions, respectively. It is also observed that the Co9S8-NDCL nanocomposites, even after 2000 cycles, exhibited good stability and a small Tafel slope in both media. This study presents a mark in the race of achieving low-cost and highly efficient pristine Co9S8 nanocomposites without doping of any precious metals.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12				2574-0970		WOS:000624546800085

Remarkably, this catalyst also shows strong long-term electrochemical durability for at least 100 h with nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency.

The effect of pulse electrodeposition parameters, such as pulse frequency, average current density and duty cycle, on the ZrO2 weight percentage in the PbO2-ZrO2 nanocomposite electrodes was investigated. The SEM and XRD tests show that PbO2-ZrO2 nanocomposite electrodes possess finer grain size than PbO2 electrodes. The service life of PbO2-ZrO2 nanocomposite electrodes reaches 298 h which is 4 times longer than that of PbO2 electrodes. The electrochemical measurements show that PbO2-ZrO2 nanocomposite electrodes possess higher oxygen evolution over-potential and larger active surface area than PbO2 electrodes. The electrocatalytic property of PbO2-ZrO2 nanocomposite electrodes was also examined for the electrochemical oxidation of rhodamine B (RhB) and good fitting was found using the relation for the pseudo-first order reaction.

X-ray powder diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies indicate the presence of strong interactions between NGDY and MoS2, which should effectively facilitate the charge transport behavior and improvement of the HER kinetics. The creative hybridization of MoS2 and NGDY endows such heterostructure with structural and compositional advantages for boosting the catalytic activity (low overpotential of 186 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 63 mV dec(-1)) and extraordinary stability (higher than all reported MoS2-based materials and even better than that of commercial Pt and almost all benchmarked electrocatalysts). All of the results not only demonstrate that NGDY can be used as an effective catalytic promoter for hydrogen production, but also provide new strategy for fabricating efficient watersplitting electrodes.									92	9	0	0	4	0	95			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000431615300019

The resultant Fe/N-doped carbon electrocatalyst possessed abundant atomically dispersed non-planar Fe-N-4 ORR active sites, with absolute presence of active D1 (Fe-II-N-4) and D3 (N-Fe-II-N2+2) sites, as well as large specific surface area and three-dimensional porous structure with hierarchical micro-/meso-/macro-pore distribution, which increased the utilization of active sites and promoted mass transport of ORR reactants. This resulted in a remarkably superior ORR activity with half-wave potential of 0.87V (20mV higher than Pt/C) and kinetic current density of 10.9mAcm(-2) at 0.85V (2.3-fold of Pt/C) in alkaline electrolyte.

Herein, a tin layer is coated on the nickel-cobalt foam surface with an electrodeposition technique and the multiple-phases of tri-metal Sn-Co-Ni phosphide (SnPi@CoP-Ni5P4/NCF) are simultaneously formed with a simple phosphating step. The synthesized SnPi@CoP-Ni5P4/NCF exhibits an excellent electrocatalytic performance for OER, which can transfer the current densities of 10 and 600 mA cm(-2) (j(10) and j(600)) in 1.0 M KOH with low overpotentials of 180 and 364 mV, respectively. The ultra-stable OER process is characterized by a low decay (2.1%) over 50 h I-t test with j(100). The quantum chemistry simulations reveal the synergistic effects of the tri-metal phosphide, while the oriented crystal phases of SnPi@CoP-Ni5P4 enable the electron redistribution for lowering H2O adsorption energy and decreasing the energy barrier for dissociation. The in situ Raman results suggest that the formed NiOOH and CoOOH act as the active intermediates for OER in the alkaline medium.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000810691900001

The addition of catalytically silent cerium to Co(OH),, not only enhanced the stability but also improved charge injection and surface oxidation kinetics. The water oxidation performance of BiVO4-CoCe(OH)(x) could be attributed to the synergistic effect of both cobalt and cerium, where cerium incorporation enhanced the surface passivation, aiding the stability of the photoanode and formation of Co(II)/(III) active sites to fasten the surface kinetics of BiVO4. An average Faradaic yield of similar to 94% suggests that majority of the holes have been utilized for water oxidation. We believe that the present design of the BiVO4 photoanode with mixed metal hydroxide provides a promising and efficient strategy for modification of a photoanode with stable and highly active oxygen evolution cocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000543715100057

Here, we design and synthesize a Ni3N-V2O3 composite via nitriding treatment of NiV-LDH precursor, which exhibits excellent electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance including low potential, fast kinetic rate and high stability. Combined with various characterizations and theoretical calculations, the performance promotion mechanism of Ni3N-V2O3 is analyzed in depth. It is proved that the confinement effect and interface coupling effect caused by the introduction of V2O3 can greatly increase the catalytic sites, regulate the charge distribution at the interface, optimize the occupancy of the N 2p orbital, and ultimately improve the electrocatalytic HER performance of Ni3N. This work provides a new idea and guidance for the design and preparation of high-efficient catalysts in the future.									35	2	0	0	4	0	35			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000600368400003

Herein, we present the electrocatalytic OER/HER of Co- and Ni-incorporated WB2 (W(1-x)TMxB2: TM = Ni and Co; x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) under alkaline media. Metal-substituted WB2 was constructed with two different synthetic approaches, molten salt (ms) and carbothermal (ct) reduction, to explore the influence of morphology on electrochemical properties to drive OER/HER in 1 M KOH. In general, materials synthesized by the ms technique are relatively better catalysts toward OER/HER. Among the samples, W0.8Co0.2B2/ms demanded the lowest respective overpotential of 340 and 363 mV to generate the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER/HER and exhibited favorable stability at 10 mA cm(-2) for 12 h which were ascribed to high double-layer capacitance (0.247 mF cm(-2)) and low charge-transfer resistance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000828520100001

While noble-metal-based electrocatalysts show excellent performance in the OER, the scarcity and high cost of noble metals limit their widespread applications. Herein, we report an efficient and stable noble-metal-free catalyst for the OER. We synthesized a high-performance interface catalyst, boron-doped graphene (BGO) nanosheet-supported nickel nitride (Ni3N) nanoparticles BGO/Ni3N, for the OER in alkaline electrolytes. This metal-free catalyst BGO/Ni3N exhibits high electrocatalytic OER activity and kinetics with a low overpotential of 290 mV at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 77.9 mV.dec(-1) in a 1 M KOH solution. Moreover, the catalysts show excellent OER stability and durability. The strong electronic coupling between p-type BGO and n-type Ni3N as well as increased electrical conductivity of BGO might be responsible for the good conductivity and fast charge transfer in the OER.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2574-0970			WOS:000583331600098

Although SrTiO3 requires ultraviolet light, after four decades, it is still the "gold standard" for the photo-catalytic splitting of water. It is chemically robust and can carry out both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions without an applied bias. While ultrahigh vacuum surface science techniques have provided useful insights, we still know relatively little about the structure of these electrodes in contact with electrolytes under operating conditions. Here, we report the surface structure evolution of a n-SrTiO3 electrode during water splitting, before and after "training" with an applied positive bias. Operando high-energy X-ray reflectivity measurements demonstrate that training the electrode irreversibly reorders the surface. Scanning electrochemical microscopy at open circuit correlates this training with a 3-fold increase of the activity toward the photo-induced water splitting. A novel first-principles joint density functional theory simulation, constrained to the X-ray data via a generalized penalty function, identifies an anatase-like structure as the more active, trained surface.									50	1	0	0	4	0	50			0002-7863			WOS:000378984300004	27281231

Hydrogen is widely regarded as an energy carrier that could circumvent this need, particularly in sight of the foreseeable spread of fuel cell cars that would use this "renewable H-2". The latter would be produced using electrolyzers, which in their better established form cannot fulfill the targeted H-2-price due to the low current densities (<0.5 A cm(geom)(-2)) associated to their liquid electrolyte. Alternatively, devices based on proton and anion-exchange membranes are currently under development, and a new kind of co electrolysis cell in which CO2 is reduced into hydrocarbons is also envisaged. Electrocatalysts play a crucial role in all of these systems, but the interplay between their surface and the reaction medium (in the so-called interface) is often overlooked in the quest towards better performance. With this motivation, this review discusses the current knowledge of the interfacial catalysis of the three (co-)electrolysis relevant reactions (i.e., the evolution of H-2 and O-2, and the reduction of CO2). From this, we identify pH and surface oxidation state as the key electrolyte-and surface-related parameters for which further understanding could lead to improved kinetics, and propose strategies for the tentative design of better electrocatalysts.

Thermochemical structure of a hybrid rocket reaction layer based on laser absorption tomography								AIAA Propulsion and Energy 2019 Forum								9 pp.	9 pp.						2019	2019	A laser absorption tomography (LAT) technique has been implemented to investigate the thermochemical structure of a hybrid rocket reaction layer through quantitative, spatially-resolved temperature and species measurements. The method is aimed to provide insights into hybrid combustion physics and mechanisms that may lead to suboptimal c* efficiency. The measurement strategy utilizes infrared laser absorption spectroscopy to target rovibrational transitions of water (H2O) and carbon monoxide (CO). Tunable diode lasers near 2.5 mum and a quantum cascade laser (QCL) near 5 mum target H2O and CO, respectively, for both temperature and mole fraction measurements. Tomographic reconstructions were conducted using a two-color, scanned-wavelength direct absorption technique at the exit plane of a hybrid rocket for several axial distances from the injector, which could then be compiled to form 2D images. Two-dimensional thermochemistry results are shown for two propellant combinations, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)/gaseous oxygen (GOx) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE)/GOx, and two injector designs. The quantitative images highlight the technique's ability to characterize the thermochemical evolution of a hybrid rocket reaction layer for different motor designs.

CHEMELECTROCHEM				3	10	SI		1546	1552		10.1002/celc.201500554				OCT 2016	2016	Si is an excellent photo-absorber for use in dual-band-gap photoelectrochemical water splitting. We investigate photoanodes with n(+) pp(+)-Si configuration under back-side illumination, which is suited to work in a tandem device stack. A co-sputtered NiCoOx film coupled to the Si was used as a protective catalyst for the water oxidation reaction in 1 m KOH. The sample showed a high photocurrent (21 mAcm(-2)) under red-light illumination (38.6 mWcm(-2)). Long-term stability testing showed a gradual decrease of activity in the beginning, and then the activity increased, yielding a cathodic shift of the onset voltage (> 50 mV), likely owing to the divergent response of Ni and Co to the Fe present in KOH. Once the activity of the sample stabilized, no further degradation was observed for the following 6 days, indicating that the demonstrated back-illuminated photoanode configuration can be considered a promising architecture for use as a bottom cell of the tandem water-splitting device under alkaline conditions.									17	1	0	0	1	0	17			2196-0216			WOS:000388377200006

The calculation of dissolution rates included dimensionless analysis technique as well as the evolution of gas generated due to decarburization reaction during the blowing process. The progress of flux dissolution and the amount of slag generated were predicted as a function of saturation concentration of CaO and MgO in the slag, CO gas flow rate and the physical properties of slag throughout the blow. The results from the model were consistent with the plant data from the study of Cicutti et al. The influences of variations in solid particle size and flux addition rate on flux dissolution were also investigated. It has been shown in this study that the amount of flux dissolved in oxygen steelmaking process is accelerated if the addition rate of flux is increased or if the size of flux particle is decreased.									33	0	0	0	0	0	33			0915-1559	1347-5460		WOS:000271176100003

However, there still remains controversy about whether Ni or Fe species as the dominate active site. In this work, we reported the NiFeOx(OH)(y) catalysts with varied atomic ratio of nickel and iron for OER to explore the dominate active site during OER processes. From the electrochemical performances, the similar Tafel slopes of catalysts with Fe species can achieve at a level of 40 mV dec(-1), outperforming the Tafel slopes of catalysts without Fe species. Thus, it can be concluded that the present Fe site can serve as the dominant active site in NiFeOx(OH)(y) for OER. Meanwhile, the Ni species is proved as the OH- adsorption site, which is beneficial to the Fe site to deliver a better OER performance. As a result, the catalyst with an optimal Ni/Fe interface (atomic ratio of 1 : 1.18) displays outstanding OER performances. It only requires a low overpotential of 250 mV to deliver current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits a small Tafel slope of 39 mV dec(-1). This catalyst also shows remarkable stability with negligible potential decay after 50 h at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2). This work offers a new sight into the specific roles of Ni and Fe in NiFeOx(OH)(y) for OER. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, a smooth electrolytic process was used to modify the redox state of the active species of milk thereby creating a mean to control these reactions. Five electroreduction treatments (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 V) were applied to pasteurized skim milk. Parameters such as redox potential, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, and current intensity were monitored during the course of each treatment. The proposed technology allows modulation of the redox potential of milk. Significant decreases of redox potential (441-707 mV) and of dissolved oxygen (3.3-8.3 mg L-1) were obtained. However, the results suggest that only a short-term modulation is created and that natural "milk equilibrium" is reestablished after 4-5 days of storage depending on the voltage difference applied during the electrochemical treatment.									30	0	0	0	21	0	30			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000238418100022	16787011

Uniformly sized micelles are loaded with a dissolved metal salt. These solution-phase precursor entities are then reduced electrochemically-one by one-to form nanoparticles (NPs). The charge transferred during the reduction of each micelle is measured individually and allows operando sizing of each of the formed nanoparticles. Thus, particles of known number and sizes can be deposited homogenously even on nonplanar electrodes. This is demonstrated for the decoration of cylindrical carbon fibre electrodes with 25 +/- 7 nm sized Au particles from HAuCl4-filled micelles. These Au NP-decorated electrodes show great catalyst performance for ORR (oxygen reduction reaction) already at low catalyst loadings. Hence, collisions of individual precursor-filled nanocontainers are presented as a new route to nanoparticle-modified electrodes with high catalyst utilization.									28	2	0	0	1	0	28			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000474117600054	30974013

Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), indicated irregular and nanoflakes morphologies for the as synthesized copper vanadate (CV-120) and copper vanadate calcined at 250 degrees C (CV-250). The semispherical platelets shaped morphology revealed for the copper vanadate calcined at 550 degrees C (CV-500). The XRD patterns confirm the monoclinic and triclinic crystal phases for CV-250 and CV-500, respectively.

Excellent electrocatalytic response with oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at an onset potential of 1.27 V (vs. RHE) is observed in CuCo2S4. On replacement of half of Co ions by Ni, the electrocatalytic activity reduced with the disappearance of OER. Electrochemical impedance studies indicated that on Ni substitution, the impedance behaviour changes from resistive to a nearly capacitive or pseudocapacitive behaviour. EIS equivalent circuit fitting model showed bulk resistance (Omega.cm(2)) values of 2.16 and 1.65 for CuCo2S4 and CuCoNiS4 respectively. However, specific capacitance increased to 308 F/g in Ni substituted thiospinel, CuCoNiS4 compared to 83 F/g in CuCo2S4 at a current density of 3 A/g and at a potential of 0.85 V (vs. Ag/AgCl).

Here, we report the use of alpha-aminoalkyl radicals in a one-step procedure that synthesizes transition metal nanoparticle-graphene composites via photo reduction. The organic photocatalyst 2-methyl-1-[4-(methylthio)phenyl]-2-(morpholinyl)phenyl]-1-butanone (I-907) undergoes Norrish Type I photocleavage to generate strongly reducing alpha-aminoalkyl radicals, when exposed to UVA. For the first time, we demonstrate its ability to reduce graphene oxide (GO) and successfully synthesize Co3O4 nanoparticles decorated on graphene (Co3O4NP-rGO). The alpha-aminoalkyl radicals simultaneously reduce GO and Co2+ salts, which nucleates on the negatively charged GO sheets and grows to form nanoparticles. The resulting Co3O4NP-rGO showed decent catalytic activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction. Our work introduces a new and environmentally friendly synthesis procedure that can be used to produce earth abundant transition metal electrocatalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2168-0485			WOS:000459367400052

By performing optical and thermal microscopy on single crystals and thin films during the application of an electric field under vacuum or oxygen-tight sealed conditions, the movement of the reduction front from the cathode to the anode, which causes a blackening of the material, is monitored. When performing electrocoloration experiments on thin film samples, the progressing reaction of the blackened region was found to be inhomogeneous and evolves as a dendrite-like finger structure. The progression of the blackening fingers follow preferentially the electric field lines and thus are influenced by distortions in the field that can be caused by metallic particles embedded in the oxide. In contrast to this, in the first stage of the reduction process no significant influence of mechanically-induced dislocations on the morphology or kinetics on the electroreduction can be found.

However, large-sized MP nanoparticles (NPs) with irregular morphologies are inevitably achieved via the solid-state reaction with high-temperature calcination, which lead to the reduced availability of the active sites. Here, a simple and straightforward strategy was developed to synthesize monodispersed, uniformly distributed, and small RhxP NPs decorated on phosphorus-doped nitride carbon (PNC) via the pyrolysis of rhodium(III) chloride, triphenylphosphine, and melamine (RhxP/PNC-m). The RhxP/PNC-m that served as a HER electrocatalyst displayed excellent performance with the overpotentials of 24 and 27 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in basic and acidic solutions, respectively. This catalyst also showed good long-term stability in both media. The high-performance of RhxP/PNC-m should be attributed to the small, monodispersed, and highly distributed RhxP NPs on PNC support, which can supply abundant catalytically active sites for HER. The developed strategy for the synthesis of small RhxP NPs may offer new opportunities toward the electrochemical applications of other metal phosphides.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000474530600085

At present, carbon or catalyst-supporting carbon materials are widely used for cathode materials of LiO2 battery. However, the unique electrode reaction and complex side reactions lead to numerous hurdles that have to be overcome. The pore blocking caused by the solid products and the byproducts generated from the side reactions severely limit the capacity performance and cycling stability. Thus, there is a great need to develop carbon materials with optimized pore structure and tunable surface chemistry to meet the special requirement of LiO2 battery. Here, we propose a strategy of vacuum-promoted thermal expansion to fabricate one micron-sized graphene matrix with a hierarchical meso-/macroporous structure, combining with a following deoxygenation treatment to adjust the surface chemistry by reducing the amount of oxygen and selectively removing partial unstable groups. The as-made graphene demonstrates dramatically tailored pore characteristics and a well-tuned surface chemical environment. When applied in LiO2 battery as cathode, it exhibits an outstanding capacity up to 19 800 mA h g(-1) and is capable of enduring over 50 cycles with a curtaining capacity of 1000 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 1000 mA g(-1). This will provide a novel pathway for the design of cathodes for LiO2 battery.									81	8	0	0	6	0	83			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000349580800047	25594548

Hydrogen generation in 6 h for the TiO2 promoted by cobalt and nickel (0.1%Co + 0.2%Ni/TiO2) is about two times (2456 mu mol H-2) compared to that of TiO2 promoted only by cobalt (1180 mu mol H-2 for 0.1%Co/TiO2) or nickel (1127 p,mol H-2 for 0.2%Ni/TiO2), and mechanically mixed TiO2 promoted by cobalt and TiO2 promoted by nickel (0.1%Co/TiO2:0.2%Ni/TiO2 = 1:1 (m/m), 1282 mu mol H-2). The high photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity over TiO2 promoted by cobalt and nickel is ascribed to enhanced photo response due to the presence of cobalt and nickel impurity level, and effective separation of photogenerated electrons and holes due to the synergistic effect of cobalt and nickel, which serve as active sites for H-2 evolution reaction (HER) and oxidation reaction (OR) respectively. This study demonstrates a viable strategy to design more active photocatalysts for photocatalytic H-2 evolution by substituting noble metals with more abundant elements using as HER and OR cocatalysts, respectively.

Herein, the electronic modulation of the semiconducting NiS2 by cation doping for advanced water electrolysis is reported. Both theoretical calculations and temperature-dependent resistivity measurements indicate the semiconductor-to-conductor transition of NiS2 after Cu incorporation. Further calculations also suggest the advantages of Cu dopant to cathodic water electrolysis by bringing Gibbs free energy of H adsorption at both Ni sites and S sites much closer to zero. It is noteworthy that water dissociation on Cu-doped NiS2 (Cu-NiS2) surface is even more favorable than those on NiS2 and Pt(111). Thus, the prepared Cu-NiS2 shows noticeably improved performance toward alkaline hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). Specifically, it requires merely 232 mV OER overpotential to drive 10 mA cm(-2); in parallel with Tafel slopes of 46 mV dec(-1). Regarding HER, an onset overpotential of only 68 mV is achieved. When integrated as both electrodes for water electrolysis, Cu-NiS2 needs only 1.64 V to drive 10 mA cm(-2), surpassing the state-of-the-art Ir/C-Pt/C couple (1.71 V). This work opens up an avenue to engineer low-cost and earth-abundant catalysts performing on par with the noble-metal-based one for water splitting.									32	0	0	0	3	0	32			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000523223900001	32243082

Core level results show that aluminium strongly reacts with all elements, disrupting Bi-O, Sr-O and Cu-O bonds with a loss of superconductivity at the surface. It was observed that initially bismuth segregates on the surface and then reacts with aluminium. The valency of copper changes from 2 + to 1 + as a result of aluminium adatoms on the surface. At lower coverages aluminium fetches oxygen from the superconducting material and forms aluminium oxide, which acts as a passivating layer for further reaction. The interface reaction was limited up to 10 angstrom of aluminium coverage. Cluster or island growth is favoured by the heterogeneous surface. The evolution of the interface is explained on the basis of atomic size and heats of oxides formation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0921-4534			WOS:A1993KP07500003

Nonetheless, the narrow electrochemical stability window caused by water electrolysis, as well as the trade-off between the stability window and other properties remain the bottleneck problem for the practical applications of aqueous electrolytes. Deep insights into the correlations between the microscopic physicochemical and electrochemical mechanisms and the macroscopic properties of aqueous electrolyte are essential for the envisaged applications, yet a systematic analysis of the recent progress in this area is still lacking. In this Perspective article, the basic mechanisms and influencing factors of water electrolysis including the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions is critically examined. We systematically review the current state-of-the-art on high-voltage aqueous electrolytes focusing on the fundamental mechanisms of ion kinetics leading to dynamic electrolyte restructuring. Recent advances on the optimization of high-voltage aqueous electrolytes are also summarized.

Benefitting from the advantages of the porous architecture, high specific surface area, facilitated electron transfer rate, an ultralow overpotential of merely 210 mV is required for the optimized NiSe/FeSe2(1:1.5) to drive the electrocatalytic water oxidation to reach to 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, by equipping NiSe/FeSe2(1:1.5) with Pt/C for electrochemical water splitting, a cell potential of merely 1.60 V is demanded to attain 10 mA cm(-2), even outperforming the IrO2 k Pt/C couple. More importantly, the structure and morphology of NiSe/FeSe2(1:1.5) are still well maintained after a longterm chronopotentiometry test.

Herein, we report the synthesis of Ni-doped Fe2O3 (denoted as Ni-Fe2O3) nanoclews as a highly efficient electrocatalyst via a facile light-assisted solution chemistry route without employing any template. Ni-Fe2O3 nanoclews demonstrate superior electrocatalytic activity toward OER with a low overpotential of 277 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and small Tafel slope of 68 mV dec(-1), accompanied by their excellent durability. Outstanding OER activity with long-standing structural and morphological stability of the nanoclews has been achieved by virtue of their clew-like morphology, comprising tiny nanorods with uniform distribution of constituent elements. Their unique structural features provide more exposed catalytically active sites, and the atomic-scale synergistic effect aroused from Fe and Ni contributes to improved intrinsic catalytic activity of Ni-Fe2O3 nanoclews.									33	1	0	0	3	0	33			2168-0485			WOS:000475838100022

Herein, the electrocatalytic activity of cation-substituted spinel cobaltite MCo2O4 (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) nanoplates with the {111} facets is investigated systematically by experiments and theoretical calculations. For both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, Ni-substituted Co3O4 hexagonal nanoplates show the best activity. It is mainly attributed to the increased surface energy per unit area and the enhanced oxygen species absorption ability, which are also evidenced by density functional theory calculations. Moreover, the three kinds of MCo2O4 nanoplates are applied in Zn-air batteries and the corresponding electrochemical performance is tested. Among the three batteries, NiCo2O4 hexagonal nanoplates also enable the highest peak power density of 110.3 mW cm(-2) and the most stable discharge-charge voltage profiles for 50 cycles, indicating that NiCo2O4 nanoplates are the promising catalyst for further Zn-air battery applications. Besides, this work illustrates that the substitution of Co by Ni or Fe can remarkably change the electronic structural states, thus tuning the electrochemical properties of the hexagonal Co3O4 nanoplates.

However, there are challenges in the generation of hydrogen fuel through water splitting using solar energy, such as the cost, and large scale manufacturing of the efficient and durable photoelectrodes. Primary challenge for solar water splitting using photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells is to develop photoelectrodes with sufficient photovoltage to electrolyze water, with maximized photon utilization efficiency, with long lifetime, and with cheap cost. This thesis then focuses on design, characterization and fabrication of novel nanostructured heterojunctions (with focus on nanowire/nanorod array heterostructures) for solar water splitting and hydrogen production. The primary focus of this thesis is to develop such photoelectrodes using low-cost, earth-abundant, non-toxic materials with cheap, facile, scalable fabrication techniques for efficient and durable solar water splitting in neutral solutions. The formation of the nanostructured array heterojunction offers unique combination of desired properties, such as enhanced light absorption, improved charge separation/collection, enlarged reaction surface area, and better electrochemical reaction dynamics. Two different types of nanostructured array heterojunctions present in this thesis including (i) Si/metal-oxides nanowire array heterojunction photoelectrodes (chapters 2-6), and (ii) all-metal-oxides nanowire/nanorod heterostructure photoelectrodes (chapters 7-8). Two different catalysts for hydrogen or oxygen evolution reaction are presented in chapters 9-10. The application of catalyst is to facilitate the gas evolution on the surface of nanostructured heterojunctions to improve the solar hydrogen production efficiency.									0	0	0		0	0	0					978-13-393-3084-6	INSPEC:16577435

We report a hybrid material consisting of NiCoO2 nanowires grown on carbon fiber paper (denoted as NiCoO2@CFP) as a highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst. In 0.1 M KOH, the highly nanostructured NiCoO2 catalyst presents a small overpotential of 0.303 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of similar to 57 mV dec(-1), comparable to the commercial precious RuO2 catalyst. Such a good performance for OER may be attributed to the NaCl-type structure of the NiCoO2 nanowires and CFP substrate, which can boost the formation of active Ni-Co layered hydroxide/oxyhydroxide species during the catalysis process. Additionally, the aligned 3D structure of NiCoO2@CFP plays an important role in the high catalytic activity for OER. These merits combined with the satisfactory stability of the hybrid material indicate that it is a promising material for water oxidation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The results demonstrate excellent supercapacitance properties based on tests with two electrode configurations to produce capacitance of 675 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1). The electrode showed excellent capacitance retention ability (85.4%), cycling stability (93%), high energy density (28.3 W h kg(-1)) and power density (0.8 kW kg(-1)). The composite exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a Tafel slope of 65 mV.dec(-1), a low onset overpotential of 75 mV and an overpotential of -180 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2).

Herein, we demonstrate a facile strategy to create ultrathin NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets grown on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as superior OER electrocatalysts. Different from previously reported NiFe-LDH nanomaterials, the newly generated NiFe-LDH@CNTs exhibit distinct features, including ultrathin building blocks, a 1D structure, 3D hierarchical architecture, and the electron effect. Significantly, it was revealed that doping Fe into Ni-LDH@CNTs optimized the performance for the OER; Ni8Fe-LDH@CNTs was found to be the most active and is one of the best non-noble metal catalysts for the OER to date. The catalysts are also highly stable for the OER with little potential shift after an 18 h test. Both X-band electron spin resonance and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated that optimized iron doping resulted in intense interaction between Nix+ and Fe3+ and electron transfer from Nix+ to Fe3+, which thus boosted the OER performance.									32	2	0	0	1	0	32			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000395797000012

Although hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are regarded as major oxidants associated with secondary organic aerosols (SOA), the kinetics and reaction mechanisms of superoxide (O-2(center dot-)) formation are rarely quantified and poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate a dominant formation of O-2(center dot-) with molar yields of 0.01-0.03% from aqueous reactions of biogenic SOA generated by (OH)-O-center dot photooxidation of isoprene, beta-pinene, alpha-terpineol, and D-limonene. The temporal evolution of (OH)-O-center dot and O-2(center dot-) formation is elucidated by kinetic modeling with a cascade of aqueous reactions including the decomposition of organic hydroperoxides, (OH)-O-center dot oxidation of primary or secondary alcohols, and unimolecular decomposition of alpha-hydroxyperoxyl radicals.

These findings and mechanistic understanding have important implications on the atmospheric fate of SOA and particle-phase reactions of highly oxygenated organic molecules as well as oxidative stress upon respiratory deposition.									18	0	0	0	5	0	18			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000606821200027	33352036

Although the plasmonic hot electrons in water reduction have been extensively studied, exactly how the plasmonic hot holes participate in the water splitting reaction has not yet been well understood. In particular, where the plasmonic hot holes participate in water oxidation is still illusive. Herein, taking Au/TiO2 as a plasmonic photocatalyst prototype, we investigated the plasmonic hot holes involved in water oxidation. The reaction sites are positioned by photodeposition together with element mapping by electron microscopy, while the distribution of holes is probed by surface photovoltage imaging with Kelvin probe force microscopy. We demonstrated that the plasmonic holes are mainly concentrated near the gold semiconductor interface, which is further identified as the reaction site for plasmonic water oxidation. Density functional theory also corroborates these findings by revealing the promotion role of interfacial structure (Ti-O-Au) for oxygen evolution. Furthermore, the interfacial effect on plasmonic water oxidation is validated by other Au semiconductor photocatalytic systems (Au/SrTiO3, Au/BaTiO3, etc.).									225	16	0	0	18	0	224			0002-7863			WOS:000409286000029	28777568

However, the origin of ORR activity on Fe-N-C catalysts is still unclear, which hinder the further improvement of Fe-N-C catalysts. Herein, we provide a model to understand the ORR activity of Fe-N-4 site from the spatial structure and energy level of the frontier orbitals by density functional theory calculations. Taking the regulation of divacancy defects on Fe-N-4 site ORR activity as examples, we demonstrate that the hybridization between Fe 3dz(2), 3dyz (3dxz) and O-2 pi* orbitals is the origin of Fe-N-4 ORR activity. We found that the Fe-O bond length, the d-band center gap of spin states, the magnetic moment of Fe site and *O-2 as descriptors can accurately predict the ORR activity of Fe-N-4 site. Furthermore, these descriptors and ORR activity of Fe-N-4 site are mainly distributed in two regions with obvious difference, which greatly relate to the height of Fe 3d projected orbital in the Z direction. This work provides a new insight into the ORR activity of single-atom M-N-C catalysts.It is of high importance to understand the origin of single-atom Fe-N-4 activity in oxygen reduction reaction. Here, the authors provide a model to understand the catalytic activity of Fe-N-4 site from the spatial structure and energy level of the frontier orbitals by density functional theory calculations.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10				2041-1723		WOS:000784997300094	35440574

However, due to limited enzyme activities and stabilities, hydrophobicity of substrates, as well as the necessity of a continuous electron and oxygen supply the implementation of P450s for industrial processes remains challenging. Aim of this study was to point out key aspects for the development of an efficient synthesis concept for cytochrome P450 catalyzed oxidations. In order to regenerate the natural cofactor NADPH, a glucose dehydrogenase was applied. The low water soluble terpene alpha-ionone was used as substrate for the model reaction system. The studies reveal that an addition of surfactants in combination with low volumetric amounts of co-solvent can significantly increase substrate availability and reaction rates. Furthermore, these additives facilitated a reliable sampling procedure during the process. Another key factor for the process design was the oxygen supply. Based on various investigations, a bubble-aerated stirred tank reactor in batch mode represents a promising reactor concept for P450 oxidations. Main restriction of the investigated reaction system was the low process stability of the P450 monooxygenase, characterized by maximum total turnover numbers of similar to 4100 mol(alpha-ionone)/Mol(P450).

Using well-defined highly oriented pyrolytic graphite, low-pressure isotopic transient experiments combined with controlled annealing periods are used to resolve the role of surface diffusion and quantify oxidation kinetics with nanomole-precision. We observe an unexpected increase in reactivity following annealing which is explained by the role of surface diffusion increasing the probability for trapping mobile oxygen at more reactive edge sites. Here, the locus of adsorption and spillover to the basal plane is distinct from the trapping location creating a more active oxygen species. Isotopic products reflect the population dynamics of oxygen added at the edge and surface diffusion that relocates basal plane oxygen to more reactive edge sites. Since this process proceeds in parallel with direct oxidation reactions, it is not likely to be observed using steady-state or conventional 'bulk' characterization techniques. Our unique time-resolved non-equilibrium measurement in a well-defined transport regime, enables observation of three distinct behaviors: short-term deactivation due to the balance of rates in oxygen supply/product formation, reactivity increases due to surface diffusion and longer-term reactivity increase with oxygen accumulation.

Despite the growing availability of operando imaging tools, to date it has not been possible to measure the electrocatalytic activities from individual material edges and directly correlate those with the local structural defects. Herein, we show the possibility of using feedback and generation/collection modes of operation of the scanning electro-chemical microscope (SECM) to independently image the topography and local electrocatalytic activity with 15-nm spatial resolution. We employed this operando microscopy technique to map out the oxygen evolution activity of a semi-2D nickel oxide nanosheet. The improved resolution and sensitivity enables us to distinguish the higher activities of the materials' edges from that of the fully coordinated surfaces in operando. The combination of spatially resolved electro-chemical information with state-of-the-art electron tomography, that unravels the 3D complexity of the edges, and ab initio calculations allows us to reveal the intricate coordination dependent activity along individual edges of the semi-2D material that is not achievable by other methods. The comparison of the simulated line scans to the experimental data suggests that the catalytic current density at the nanosheet edge is similar to 200 times higher than that at the NiO basal plane.									32	3	0	0	1	0	34			0027-8424			WOS:000471039700015	31127040

Highly efficient heteroatom-doping in graphene stacking generated a number of joints in the nanotubes, which harvested numerous defects as active sites for oxygen catalysis. Moreover, the Co9S8 nanoparticles were found to be tightly defined in the graphitic carbon shell, which were triggered by the spatial confinement of UiO-66-NH2. This nanostructure greatly enhanced the reaction kinetics and the stability of the catalyst. The carbon nanotube-Co9S8 composites via pyrolysis at 800 degrees C (Co9S8@CT-800) showed highly bifunctional catalytic activity for O-2 catalysis processes. The low overpotential for ORR obtained for Co9S8@CT-800 was comparable to that of commercial Pt/C, and the small Tafel slope of 72 mV dec(-1) for OER was better than that obtained for conventional RuO2. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the high activity of the developed nanocomposites for oxygen electrocatalysis in an alkaline medium was attributed to the synergistic effects of Co9S8 and the N-doped graphitic shell.									77	1	0	0	5	0	77			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000431506600053

However, most of nitrogen heteroatoms are doped into the bulk phase of carbon without site selectivity, which significantly reduces the contacts of feedstocks with the active dopants in a conductive scaffold. Herein we proposed the chemical vapor deposition of a nitrogen-doped graphene skin on the 3D porous graphene framework and donated the carbon/carbon composite as surface N-doped grapheme (SNG). In contrast with routine N-doped graphene framework (NGF) with bulk distribution of N heteroatoms, the SNG renders a high surface N content of 1.81 at%, enhanced electrical conductivity of 31 S cm(-1), a large surface area of 1531 m 2 g(-1), a low defect density with a low I-D/I-G ratio of 1.55 calculated from Raman spectrum, and a high oxidation peak of 532.7 degrees C in oxygen atmosphere. The selective distribution of N heteroatoms on the surface of SNG affords the effective exposure of active sites at the interfaces of the electrode/electrolyte, so that more N heteroatoms are able to contact with oxygen feedstocks in oxygen reduction reaction or serve as polysulfide anchoring sites to retard the shuttle of polysulfides in a lithium-sulfur battery. This work opens a fresh viewpoint on the manipulation of active site distribution in a conductive scaffolds for multi-electron redox reaction based energy conversion and storage.

This study reports that HNO3 activation improves the photocatalytic activity of 3D melamine-derived C3N4 (MCN) materials, which degrade the organic pollutant rhodamine B (RhB). HNO3 treatment under reflux removes the carbonaceous impurities in MCN and introduces oxygen-containing functional groups on its surface. Under visible light irradiation, the nitric acid treated MCN (NT-MCN) completely degrades RhB within 30 min. Photophysical characterizations and control experiments with radical scavengers reveal that MCN and NT-MCN follow different reaction mechanisms. Because NT-MCN exhibits a longer photoluminescence lifetime, smaller electrochemical resistance, and larger photocurrent than those of MCN, it enables a better transfer of charge carriers during the catalytic reaction.

Here for the first time, by using the 4H/fcc Au@Ag nanoribbons (NRBs) as seeds, we report the synthesis of 4H/fcc trimetallic Au@PdAg core shell NRBs via the galvanic reaction method under ambient conditions. Moreover, this strategy can also be used to synthesize 4H/fcc trimetallic Au@PtAg and quatermetallic Au@PtPdAg core shell NRBs. Impressively, for the first time, these alloy shells, i.e., PdAg, PtAg, and PtPdAg, epitaxially grown on the 4H/fcc Au core with novel 4H hexagonal phase were successfully synthesized. Remarkably, the obtained 4H/fcc Au@PdAg NRBs exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction, which is even quite close to that of the commercial Pt black. We believe that our findings here may provide a novel strategy for the crystal-structure-controlled synthesis of advanced functional noble multimetallic nanomaterials with various promising applications.									152	15	0	0	8	0	154			0002-7863			WOS:000369558000047	26752521

The exchange current density of HOR increases linearly with the increase of step atom density up to the surface with the terrace atomic rows n = 9; however, it becomes constant on the surfaces with n <= 9. The activation energy and pre-exponential factor of HOR/HER decrease with the increase of the step atom density, but they also become constant on the surfaces with n <= 9. These results support that the step atom is the active site of HOR/HER; however. a part of the step atoms contributes to HOR/HER on the surfaces with n <= 9.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000269999700002

Mesoporous and bulk Ni films were electrodeposited from simple sulphate solutions with and without lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) templates formed by the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The mesoporous microstructure increases the electrochemical surface area 20-fold relative to the bulk films. In the first instance, this improves the hydrogen (HER) and oxygen (OER) evolution reaction performances significantly on mesoporous (MP) Ni electrodes, but only to a limited degree owing to the substantial surface deactivation of nickel and surface coverage during water splitting in alkaline media. The water splitting process is further enhanced by magnetisation on both bulk and mesoporous Ni electrodes, as evidenced by the reduced onset potential, over-potential, and Tafel slope, as well as by the increased exchange current density; these effects are stronger in the perpendicular magnetisation direction owing to the ordinary magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) effect. However, MP-Ni electrodes exhibit extraordinary performance with respect to ordinary MHD, which was attributed to the creation of high-gradient magnetic force (HGMF). The maximum HER performance of the magnetised MP-Ni electrodes demonstrates a remarkable improvement, e.g. eta(OER) = 340.0 mV, which is comparable with more complex nanomaterials, e.g. hybrid metal oxides, whereas their maximum OER performance, e.g. eta(OER) = 296.0 mV, comes very close to those of noble metal electrodes, e.g. Ru2O. Our calculations based on a simple nanotubular nickel structure show that MP-Ni creates magnetic gradients of the order of 10(7) T m(-1). This magnitude of magnetic force is sufficient to promote effective attractive/repulsive forces on ions and gas bubbles as well as the dissociation of diamagnetic water molecules, enhancing the HER and OER during water splitting during electrolysis. Our present remarkably enhanced water electrolysis device, achieved using magnetized mesoporous nickel, represents a very sophisticated and low-cost electrode material choice to replace costly electrocatalysts in water splitting.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000597647100049

Here, we report a facile, scalable synthesis of a self-standing bifunctional electrode with CoMn2O4 (CMO) in situ embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (NCNFs) by electrospinning. Strong coupling between CMO and NCNFs facilitates the multiphase charge transport process. Meanwhile, the conductive carbonaceous network contributes to the overall stability by protecting CMO from corrosion and aggregation. As a result, the nanocomposite exhibits remarkable Pt-like ORR activity (onset/half-wave potential of 1.05/0.83 V) and high OER activity (overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)). The rechargeable Zn-air battery assembled with CMO/NCNF delivers a peak power density of 224 mW cm(-2) and a low charge-discharge voltage gap of 0.85 V even after 350 cycles at 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the assembled bendable solid-state Zn-air battery shows rechargeability, suggesting the promising potential of spinel/carbon hybrids in flexible devices.									39	2	0	0	0	0	39			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000496150500015

Although extensive studies have focused on the relatively cheaper 3d transition metal oxide catalysts, the effect of trimetallic composites on the catalytic ability still remains elusive. Herein, we selected FeCo catalyst as the platform and investigated the catalytic activity of trimetallic composites, which were synthesized by incorporating Mo, W or Ni into the FeCo catalyst. The experimental results evidenced that FeCoMo/CP exhibited high catalytic activity towards water oxidation in alkaline solution, which required an overpotential of only similar to 270 mV. Such impressive catalytic performance of FeCoMo/CP can be attributed to the fact that the introduction of Mo appreciably modulated the electronic structure of the Fe and Co centers, leading to an enhancement in intrinsic active sites. Benefiting from the tight contact with the highly conductive carbon paper substrate, FeCoMo/CP showed excellent stability up to 120 h. These results indicate that the surface engineering of FeCo-based catalysts by incorporating non-noble metals is a rational strategy to promote the performance of electrocatalysts.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000431819200085

Briefly, acidic PVA-[BMIM]Cl-lactic acid-LiBr and neutral PVA-[BMIM]Cl-sodium acetate-LiBr hydrogel polymer electrolytes are used as catholyte and anolyte, respectively. The acidic condition of the catholyte contributes to suppression of the undesired irreversible reaction of Br- and extension of the oxygen evolution reaction potential to a higher value than that of the redox potential of Br-/Br-3(-) reaction. The observed Br-/Br3- redox activity at the cathode contributes to enhance the cathode capacitance. The neutral condition of the anolyte helps extend the operating voltage window of the supercapacitor by introducing hydrogen evolution reaction overpotential to the anode. The electrosorption of nascent H on the negative electrode also increases the anode capacitance. As a result, the prepared solid-state hybrid supercapacitor shows a broad voltage window of 1.6 V, with a high Coulombic efficiency of 97.6% and the highest energy density of 16.3 Wh/kg with power density of 932.6 W/kg at 2 A/g obtained. After 10 000 cycles of galvanostatic charge and discharge tests at the current density of 10 A/g, it exhibits great cyclic stability with 93.4% retention of the initial capacitance. In addition, a robust capacitive performance can also be observed from the solid-state supercapacitor at different bending angles, indicating its great potential as a flexible energy storage device.									38	0	0	0	2	0	38			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000419082000017	29206439

Hydrogen fuel is considered as a better replacement due to its efficiency and eco-friendly nature. Water electrolysis is the highly recommendable method to produce the high pure hydrogen and in continuation, finding the efficient and non-noble metal electrocatalysts are highly desirable to have commercial production. Transition metal phosphates are having many advantages, which include their abundance in nature, less cost, and commercially viable. Herein, one simple synthetic strategy is proposed for the production of porous cobalt phosphate nanoparticles (NPs) by a simple wet chemical route. The synthesized cobalt phosphate NPs have subjected to the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline medium (1 M KOH), which showed a lesser overpotential of 299 mV at 10 mAcm(-2) current density and showing excellent stability over 12 h. Owing to this excellent outcome, the designed cobalt phosphate NPs could be utilized for other energy related applications in near future.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000582567000092

The formation of Ni3S4/NiS2 mixed-phase material was confirmed by PXRD analysis and the presence of multiple oxidation states of Ni (II and III) and incorporated Fe (III) was revealed by XPS studies. The electrochemical studies demonstrated that Fe-Ni3S4/NiS2 electrocatalyst has a high catalytic activity towards alkaline OER, as it requires only 280 mV overpotential to achieve the benchmark current density of 10 mA/cm(geo)(2). The superiority of the catalyst was exhibited by low charge transfer resistance of about 6 Ohms, along with low Tafel slope of 43 mV dec(-1). Further, the observed long-term stability for 72 h and remarkable Faradaic efficiency with 99% indicate good durability and excellent selectivity towards OER, respectively. The superior activity of Fe-Ni3S4/NiS2 is attributed to fast kinetics and low charge transfer resistance of the material facilitating the generation of active catalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2199-692X			WOS:000823631900001

Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have recently attracted considerable attention as functional materials, including water oxidation (electro)catalysts, owing to their high controllability in various properties via cation and/or ligand substitutions. However, there are still only a few successful studies on the enhancement of water oxidation on particulate photocatalysts by modification with PBAs. Herein, we report the use of cobalt hexacyanoferrate (KxCo [Fe(CN)(6)]y.nH(2)O, denoted as CoHCF) as an effective cocatalyst on a visible-light-responsive oxynitride (TaON) photocatalyst for improving O-2 evolution in the presence of various electron acceptors. The loading of CoHCF nanoparticles on the TaON surface via a simple impregnation method clearly enhanced the O-2 evolution rate from a basic (pH 8) aqueous solution containing Ag+ as a sacrificial electron donor; the enhancement was comparable to that of the widely-studied cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOx(OH)(y)). Importantly, it was revealed that the CoHCF nanoparticles loaded on TaON are chemically stable even under acidic conditions with pH below 3, whereas conventional Co-based cocatalysts such as oxide (CoOx) and oxyhydroxide (CoOx(OH)(y)) are unstable in these conditions due to their dissolution and thereby lose their functions. Thus, the TaON modified with CoHCF cocatalysts exhibited higher O-2 evolution rates than unloaded one in acidic aqueous solutions in the presence of not only sacrificial electron acceptor (Ag+) but also reversible ones (Fe3+, IO3-) under visible light irradiation.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1010-6030	1873-2666		WOS:000743245400002

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were used to analyze the microstructure and composition of the prepared coating. The composition of the prepared electrode was analyzed by X-ray diffractometry (XRD). The electrochemically active area can be measured by the number of reactive sites in the electrochemical reaction. Electrochemical workstations were used to test the anodic polarization curve (LSV), AC impedance test (EIS), and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The electrochemical properties of the electrode could be obtained. It was found that the oxygen evolution overpotentials of the electrode prepared at a Ru:Sb molar ratio of 2:1 are the lowest and is 0.3058 V under the conditions of 500 A/m(2). The surface morphology is a block-like crack structure. The electrode prepared at a Ru:Sb molar ratio of 2:1 obtained a larger electrochemical active area. With the increase of Ru, the life is gradually increased to 103 h. (C) 2019 The Electrochemical Society.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000494282300002

Loadings varying between 20 and 140 mg cm(-2) were tested. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to evaluate the coatings roughness (R-f) and morphology (phi) factors, complemented by optical microscopy observations. The values obtained from the two methods are in excellent agreement The R-f values, ranging from 848 +/- 50 to 4260 +/- 60, are within the highest in the open literature.A simulation, of the effect of the oxide loading on the coatings Rf values, was performed using just the experimental values of the roughness factors for oxide free foam and pelleted electrodes. It was found that the increase of oxide loading causes a quasi linear increase of the electrodes active surface area. Simulated values were in excellent agreement with the experimental roughness factors and pore resistances obtained by CV and EIS. The electrodes were tested for oxygen evolution.

In the complex, the manganese-nitrogen distances were different, and the geometry and the metal ion environment showed the distortion. The cyclic voltammetric measurements have been performed to assess its redox characteristics. The presence of oxidation wave at + 0.62 V and + 0.81 V vs. SCE or + 0.8 V and + 1.0 V vs. NHE suggested that this complex could catalyze the oxidation of water, therefore, simulate the water-oxidizing complex (WOC) of photosystem H (PS H). The measurements of photoreduction of 2, 6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP), and oxygen evolution in the manganese-depleted and the complex 1-reconstituted PS II preparations just support our conjecture.									6	1	0	0	1	0	6			1001-604X	1614-7065		WOS:000188291800015

The reaction rates alone show that sodium will be produced by proton captures on Ne-22 in the region of a globular-cluster giant in which oxygen is being depleted. A more detailed calculation shows that significant amounts of the much more abundant Ne-20 can be transformed in Na-23 on somewhat longer time scales. Atmospheric oxygen depletions that are the result of very deep mixing are bound to be accompanied by sodium enhancements due to Ne-22 (p,gamma) Na-23 reactions; they are quite likely to be accompanied by larger sodium enhancements that begin with proton captures on Ne-20. One cannot argue that a Na-O anticorrelation is strong evidence for a primordial account of the observed variations in O and Na. We find that Al-27 can also be produced by very deep mixing and that the aluminum enhancements that would result are likely to be smaller than the sodium enhancements. Finally, we suggest a number of ways in which the consequences of this sort of very deep mixing might be distinguished from primordial variations in oxygen, sodium, and aluminum.									226	0	0	0	0	0	226			0004-6280			WOS:A1993KU97100008

Here, rationally synthesized mesoporous nanorods of nickel-cobalt-iron-sulfur-phosphorus composites are tightly self-supported on Ni foam as a high-performance, low cost, and stable bifunctional electrocatalyst for water electrolysis. The targeted designing and rational fabrication give rise to the nanorod-like morphology with large surface area and excellent conductivity. The NiCoFe-PS nanorod/NF can reach 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of 195 mV with a Tafel slope of 40.3 mV dec(-1) for the oxygen evolution reaction and 97.8 mV with 51.8 mV dec(-1) for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Thus, this bifunctional catalyst shows low potentials of 1.52 and 1.76 V at 10 and 50 mA cm(-2) toward overall water splitting with excellent stability for over 200 h, which are superior to most non-noble metal-based bifunctional electrocatalysts recently. This work provides a new strategy to fabricate multiple metal-P/S composites with the mesoporous nanorod-like structure as bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting.									55	2	0	0	2	0	55			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000495993000001	31721424

The plasma treatment could provide a burst open and high-energy electron/ion collision mechanism for doping and exfoliation. Ammonium carbonate was previously inserted into the interlayer of GO powder, and the rapid release of the NH3 and CO2 gases during DBD plasma treatment could exfoliate the GO powder into few-layer PEGO (<4 layers). Moreover, the plasma treatment also introduced the nitrogen dopant (5.26 at%), which is proven to be an efficient strategy to enhance the performance of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts. The resulting N-PEGO showed a high onset potential comparable to that of commercial Pt/C, i.e., 0.89 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and good electrocatalysis stability towards the ORR. This fast and effective one-step doping and exfoliation strategy demonstrated a new industrial-scale N-doped graphene fabrication technique.									81	12	0	0	5	0	84			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000423981200012

On the other hand, the recycling of electrode materials in LIBs has attracted serious attention due to environmental, resourcing and energy issues. In order to reduce the cost of the recycling and make full use of the transition metal in the cathode materials in LIBs, herein, we developed a simple method to convert the recycled LCO from spent LIBs into an efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The long-time cycling of LCO in a LIB would lead to several structural changes in terms of chemical composition, particle size and metal valence etc. The altered structural properties of the recycled LCO with a relatively smaller particle size and activated surface may contribute to enhanced electrocatalytic activity for OER. The electrocatalytic activity improves with the increase of the cycle number of LIBs. As an electrocatalysts for OER, the recycled LCO from spent LIBs after cycling for 500 cycles can deliver a current density of 9.68 mA cm(-2) at 1.65 V, which is about 3.8 times that of pristine LCO (2.50 mA cm(-2)).									11	1	0	0	0	0	11				2046-2069		WOS:000387726500087

Here, Pt embedded highly-porous CeO2 hollow sphere (Pt/CeO2 HS) composites are developed by a one-pot template-free solvothermal method. Evolution mechanism studies unravel that the Pt/CeO2 HS composites are derived from a self-assembly-reduction-Ostwald ripening process, where Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs) are embedded into ceria mesoporous hollow spheres. The as-developed embedment strategy is more facile, sustainable and cost-effective than conventional deposition approaches, ensuring the precise control of the location, distribution, and uniformity of Pt NPs throughout the outer shell of hollow spherical CeO2. Importantly, the Pt NP embedding process could be determined to play a key role in creating oxygen vacancies and activating surface chemisorbed oxygen. Besides that, the aggregation of Pt NPs can be efficiently inhibited in the Pt/CeO2 HS composites, and more active sites should be involved in catalytic reactions. All these advantages contribute to the strikingly improved performance as well as excellent stability of the Pt/CeO2 HS composites toward CO oxidation reaction compared with mesoporous CeO2 nanospheres (CeO2 NS) and Pt/CeO2 NS reference catalysts. These findings present a decent protocol for desgining noble metal/oxide hollow structural composites in heterogeneous catalysis.									24	1	0	0	2	0	25				2052-1537		WOS:000412457600005

Hence, developing effective battery materials are in great need. In this work, an electrode composed of Co3O4 nanowire-assembled clusters is developed. The porous Co3O4 nanowires are directly coupled to the underlying nickel foam to form clusters, avoiding the use of additional binders and conductive carbons. This hierarchical structure not only provides large active surfaces and facilitates species transport, but also favors the structural stability. In an alkaline solution, this electrode exhibits high activity toward both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions and large specific capacitance, indicating the excellent electrochemical performance. A Zn-Co3O4 battery using this electrode delivers an energy density up to 239 Wh kg(-1) on the basis of the Co3O4 loading and the theoretical capacity of zinc, and the capacity retention reaches 84.1% after 1000 cycles. Moreover, a hybrid Zn-Co3O4/air battery fitted with the present electrode exhibits a high capacity of 771 mAh gzn(-1) and excellent cycling stability for over 1000 cycles (over 333 h) at 10 mA cm(-2) with a fixed capacity of 1.67 mA cm(-2) while maintaining the energy efficiency of similar to 70%. The results show that the nickel foam coated with Co3O4 nanowire-assembled clusters is a promising electrode for high-performance rechargeable Zn-based batteries with high energy density, energy efficiency, and cycling stability.									120	8	0	0	2	0	121			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000449444000011

Further, we investigated a series of mixed-metal with multi-ligands materials as OER catalysts to explore their possible advantages and features. It is found that the Ni doping is an effective approach for optimizing the electronic configuration, changing lattice ordering degree, and thus enhancing activities of HMT-based electrocatalysts. Also, the crystalline-amorphous boundaries of various HMT-based electrocatalyst can be easily controlled by simply changing amounts of Ni-precursor added. As a result, the optimized ultrathin (Co, 0.3Ni)-HMT nanosheets can reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotential of 330 mV with a small Tafel slope of 66 mV dec(-1). Our findings show that the electronic structure changes induced by Ni doping, 2D nanosheet structure, and MOF frameworks with multiligands compositions play critical roles in the enhancement of the kinetically sluggish electrocatalytic OER. The present study emphasizes the importance of ligands and active metals via hybridization for exploring novel efficient electrocatalysts.

J	Zhang, Cunjin; Qin, Shuaibo; Li, Bo; Jin, Peng				Jin, Peng/C-7280-2008				Dual-metal atom incorporated N-doped graphenes as oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysts: high activities achieved by site synergies								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				10	15			8309	8323		10.1039/d1ta10874c		MAR 2022		APR 12 2022	2022	Cheap and highly efficient electrocatalysts are needed to expedite the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis to provide clean and sustainable hydrogen energy. In this work, systematic first-principles calculations were conducted to investigate the detailed OER process over the popular N-doped graphenes containing low-cost single-metal atoms (MN4-gra; M = Fe, Co, Ni) and dual-metal atoms (homonuclear MMN6-gra and heteronuclear M1M2N(6)-gra). For the first time, two types of main reaction mechanisms with five possible reaction pathways were thoroughly considered: (1) the single-site OER occurs on a single-metal atom (M path) or on a single-carbon atom (C path); reaction intermediates transfer between a metal and a carbon atom (e.g., M-C-M or C-C-M path); (2) dual-site *O-*O coupling between two metal atoms (M-M path) or between a metal and a carbon atom (M-C path). The latter three pathways all could break the troublesome linear scaling relationships between different reaction intermediates due to the possible synergy of two catalytically active sites. Importantly, four dual-atom catalysts exhibit much lower theoretical overpotentials eta(OER) (M path: FeFeN6-gra 0.35 V and CoCoN6-gra 0.38 V; M-C-M (C-C-M) path: CoCoN6-gra 0.30 V, NiNiN6-gra 0.37 V, and FeCoN6-gra 0.33 V; M-M path: CoCoN6-gra 0.28 V and FeCoN6-gra 0.40 V; M-C path: FeFeN6-gra 0.33 V) than not only all the MN4-gra counterparts, but also the benchmark commercial RuO2 (eta(OER): 0.47 V) and IrO2 (eta(OER): 0.58 V) electrocatalysts. The origins of their superior catalytic activities are different: for the catalysts along the M path, it stems from the strong electronic regulation effect of the second metal atom on the single-atom site, whereas for those along the M-C-M (C-C-M) and M-M (M-C) ones it is ascribed to the transfer and coupling of intermediate adsorbates, respectively. All these diverse site synergies markedly alter the adsorptions of intermediates and optimize the reaction free energy profiles. The current work provides new insights into the emerging dual-atom catalysts at an atomic level, and the disclosed various reaction pathways and sophisticated synergistic effects as well as exact activity origins could help deeply understand and further design novel multi-site (electro)catalysts for wide energy application.									5	0	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000768375800001

There are many methods for hydrogen production. Fuel processing technologies transform a hydrogen containing material such as coal, petroleum, or natural gas into a hydrogen rich stream. However, these processes need an external heat source for the reactor and produce large amounts of carbon dioxide. Hydrogen production by electrolysis of water is regarded as an advanced technology to make effective use of renewable resources, such as wind power, solar power, etc., to achieve energy storage and conversion. Water electrolysis includes hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). These reactions are normally catalyzed by precious metals, such as platinum (Pt) and iridium (Ir)-based catalysts, which limits the large-scale application of electrolysis of water. Thus, it is necessary to develop alternative catalysts with low cost and high performance. Two-dimensional (2D) materials have considerable application prospect in electrocatalysis of H_2O because of their unique structural and electronic properties. In addition, 2D materials with a reduced dimension compared with the bulk material exhibits several distinctive properties, such as high specifc surface area, high thermal and electric conductivity and more catalytic active sites. In this review, the key scientific issues and the latest advances in the two half-reactions (HER and OER) of electrocatalytic water splitting with 2D materials are systematically summarized. The mechanisms of HER and OER are discussed briefly. The involved 2D materials for HER in this work include graphene, graphene encapsulated transition-metal catalysts, g-C_3N_4 and 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides, while for OER contain layered double hydroxide (LDH) and graphene encapsulated transition-metal catalysts materials. For graphene, g-C_3N_4 and 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides, there are various techniques to enhance the catalytic activity of the materials, such as the introduction of defects, heteroatom-doped (N, B, P, S or metal atoms) and functional groups. For graphene encapsulating earth-abundant transition metal nanoparticles, the activity of electrocatalytic water splitting can be improved by the electron transfer from the metal core. Furthermore, the utilization of strong coupling between various 2D materials is another facile approach to optimize the catalytic activity. This review enumerates several typical 2D materials and recent applications for the two half-reactions of electrocatalytic water splitting respectively. The future challenges and opportunities in this field are also discussed. The strategy for designing novel HER electrocatalysts with high performance mainly focuses on the electronic structure engineering of 2D materials to modify electronic properties and optimize the adsorption and desorption behavior of H atoms. The design of high-performance and long-term durability OER electrocatalysts in acidic medium still remains a major challenge. Although the obtained electrocatalysts for water splitting still suffer from some serious problems when it comes to large-scale applications, the unique electronic structure of 2D materials and possibility of modifcations on the surface offer opportunities to synthesize novel electrocatalysts with low cost, high catalytic activity and high stability. Thus, it is possible to adopt 2D materials as catalysts in electrocatalytic water splitting reactions. It is expected to give guidance for the comprehension of 2D materials and their applications in electrocatalytic water splitting.			氢能是一种高热值、无污染的洁净能源.电解水制氢被认为是一种有效利用可再生能源,如风能、太阳能等,实现能量储存和转换的前沿科技.二维材料独特的结构和电子特性使其在催化电解水反应中具有广阔的应用前景.本文系统综述了二维材料在催化电解水反应中的两个半反应阴极析氢反应(HER)和阳极析氧反应(OER)中的关键科学问题和最新进展,并展望了该领域所面临的挑战和机遇.						2	1	0	0	0	0	2			0023-074X			CSCD:6087242

The evaluation of the Thiele modulus, phi, and of the parameter epsilon(0) (which compares the magnitude of the fluxes of interest to and from the surface), allows definition of the regimes in which fast or slow reactions in the gas phase surrounding a drop of liquid metal are possible in the presence of variable oxygen concentrations. The kinetic features of the process are described in terms of these different reaction regimes, and on the basis of the thermodynamic stability of the possible oxidation products. Diagrams on a plane log phi(2)/log epsilon(0) are drawn, immediately allowing one to know the range of P-O2(0), and Tin which the reaction considered is thermodynamically possible, and to foresee the evolution in this field from a kinetic point of view, as a function of P-O2(0), and T. Therefore, the treatment presented here (and applied to selected cases of technological interest) allows a ''stability field'' for a chosen oxide on the log phi(2)/log epsilon(0) plane to be defined, and the behaviour of the system from a kinetic-fluodynamic point of view to be predicted when the flow parameters and the geometry of the experimental set-up are known. In particular, the reactive gas fluxes at the liquid-vapour interface can be evaluated as a function of the different experimental conditions. Kinetic-fluodynamic diagrams for liquid metal-oxygen systems containing Pb, Sn, Zn, Cu and Al are presented, as well as an application of the model to surface tension measurements on liquid tin, which gives semi-quantitative confirmation of the theory developed here.									28	0	0	0	0	0	28			0022-2461			WOS:A1994NF71700020

However, the low conductivity and weak stability of FeS2 limits its application. Herein, two-dimensional (2D) hetero-structured FeS2/reduced graphene (FeS2/rGO) photocatalyst was synthesized by a facile sodium-oleate-assisted two-phase solvothermal method. The optimized FeS2/rGO hybrids possessed excellent initial conversion frequency (TOF, 10.96 mu mol(O2) mol(metal)(-1) s(-1)) and oxygen evolution amount (21.2 mu mol), which was 2.5 times higher than of pure FeS2. Further studies revealed that the excellent catalytic property was attributed to the 2D heterojunction between FeS2 and rGO, which improved the optical adsorption of the hybrids and accelerated the rapid transfer of photogenerated charges from FeS2 surface to water molecules. The FeS2/rGO hybrids remained stable even after three runs photocatalytic reaction under the strong oxidation conditions. This study provides a facile strategy for the design of FeS2/rGO hybrids as a highly efficient water oxidation catalyst, improving the development of solar energy conversion.

However, fabrication of such electrode materials with both high catalytic activity and long-term stability remains challenging. Herein, we developed an in situ self-corrosion photodeposition method to synthesize a self-standing hollow Fe-NiOHx catalyst on photoactive ZnO nanorods. The stable phase of the catalyst and the excellent adhesion interaction with the substrate brings excellent electrochemical stability. The synergetic effect between Ni and Fe atoms significantly enhances the adsorption of the OH group and facilitates the removal of the surface H atom, leading to lower overpotential. As a result, the as-fabricated catalyst exhibits excellent OER activity and remarkable stability at a high current density, which only requires an overpotential of 210 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and shows no significant degradation after a 240-h durability test at a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2). This research work provides an alternative approach for the rational design of desirable electrocatalysts with high activity and long-term stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000866550700001

The compound crystallizes in a monoclinic space group P2(1)/C. In this work, we are reporting a unique synthesis method to prepare this MOF without using any formate salt or formic acid. The source of formate in compound Co-MOF is dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent used in the relevant synthesis. This metal-organic framework (MOF) containing compound, which can be described as a functional MOF, has recently been exploited for hydrogen isotope separation. This functional material has never been used as an electrocatalyst. In this work, we have demonstrated that this water insoluble compound Co-MOF can be used as heterogeneous electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by water oxidation at neutral pH. An overpotential of 275.5 mV versus RHE was required to attain a current density of 1 mAcm(-2). The relevant Faradic efficiency (89.93%) and the turn over frequency (TOF) of 0.277 s(-1) make the material an efficient electrocatalyst for water oxidation to molecular oxygen at neutral pH.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2251-2373	2251-2381		WOS:000833415600001

In this study, we use density functional theory calculations to investigate the possibility that surface defects formed during dissolution are responsible for the OER activity of RuO2. It has been well-established experimentally that RuO2 undergoes dissolution during OER, yet little is known about the atomic structure or catalytic reactivity of the resulting defect sites.. Through simulation of point defects, steps, and kinks derived from the RuO2 (110) surface, we discover a 0.7 eV range in the primary descriptor for OER activity, with the most active sites outperforming those at the ideal (110) surface by nearly 0.5 eV. We postulate that these variations in reactivity are due to differences in the local electronic structure, and we investigate in more detail the electronic structure of two singly coordinated sites at the same Ru atom located at a kink. Finally, we investigate possible dissolution pathways that may proceed at the RuO2 surface under OER conditions.									69	0	0	0	4	0	69			1932-7447			WOS:000409395700022

Although tremendous efforts have been made, hydrogen generation from pure water by an efficient semiconductor catalyst driven by visible light still remains a significant challenge. Herein we present an effective photocatalyst based on Ce-doped WO3 and CdS powders embedded into platinum (Pt) layer. With the help of artificial blood component perfluorodecalin (PFDL), our system achieved 186.2 mu mol.g(catalyst)(-1) H-2 in 4 h without sacrifice reagent under visible light irradiation and maintained excellent stability in 24 h without obvious decay. The hydrogen evolution activity and excellent stability are assigned to the enhancement of the electrons and holes relay and transfer by Pt layer, and the removal of nascent oxygen from catalyst via CeO2 and artificial blood PFDL path, and the suppression of undesirable hydrogen and oxygen recombination reverse reaction.

Herein, we report the facile solvothermal synthesis of amorphous Fe-doped Co-3(PO4)(2)(Am Fe-Co-3(PO4)(2)) ultrathin nanowires with diameters of about 2.0 nm as an efficient electrocatalyst for the OER. The amorphous nature and ultrathin nanowire structure can increase the electrochemically active surface area for exposing more catalytically active sites; meanwhile, Fe incorporation contributes to enhancing intrinsic catalytic activity and electrical conductivity. As a result, Am Fe-Co-3(PO4)(2)ultrathin nanowires with structural and compositional benefits exhibit remarkable OER electrocatalytic performance, with a low overpotential of 245 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)in 1.0 M KOH, and a small Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1), as well as robust durability.

Transition metal phosphates have been reported as a potential candidate due to the unique coordination and corresponding electronic structure. Herein, we adopted a facile method for preparing NaCoPO4@C derived from a metal organic framework (MOF) as a bifunctional electrode. ZIF-67 was synthesized before a refluxing process with Na2HPO4 to form a precursor, which is transformed into the final product via calcination in different atmospheres. Specifically, the resultant NaCoPO4@C exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1178.7 F g -1 at a current density of 1 A g -1 for a supercapacitor. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled with active carbon displays a high capacitance of 163.7 F g -1 at 1 A g -1. In addition, as an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, the NaCoPO4@C electrode requires only 299 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm -2. These results suggest that the rational design of MOF-derived NaCoPO4@C provides a variety of practical applications in electrochemical energy conversion and storage.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1793-2920			KJD:ART002544109

PCC 6803. These monosaccharides were shown to sharply suppress the photosynthetic oxygen evolution from wild-type Synechocystis, yet they practically did not affect this process in several 2dDg-resistant mutants, which retained the capacity for glucose uptake and therefore were classified as mutants with a disturbed mechanism of photosynthesis inhibition by glucose. 2dDg reduced the level of mRNAs for "photosynthetic" genes psbA and psbD, encoding the proteins of the photosystem II reaction center only in the wild-type but not the mutant cyanobacterium. At the same time, the level of mRNA for the "nonphotosynthetic" desaturase gene (desA) was not reduced in both wild-type and mutant Synechocystis cells. The results obtained verify the hypothesis that glucose participates in photosynthesis regulation, in particular, in the transcriptional control of the genes encoding the proteins of the photosynthetic apparatus.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1021-4437	1608-3407		WOS:000089482700002

As this process is thermodynamically unfavorable and is challenging from a kinetic point of view, the development of highly efficient catalysts with low energy cost is a subject of fundamental significance. Herein, we report on iron-based films as highly efficient water-oxidation catalysts. The films can be quickly deposited onto electrodes from Fe-II ions in acetate buffer at pH7.0 by simple cyclic voltammetry. The extremely low iron loading on the electrodes is critical for improved atom efficiency for catalysis. Our results showed that this film could catalyze water oxidation in neutral phosphate solution with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 756h(-1) at an applied overpotential of 530mV. The significance of this approach includes the use of earth-abundant iron, the fast and simple method for catalyst preparation, the low catalyst loading, and the large TOF for O-2 evolution in neutral aqueous media.									235	17	0	0	7	0	238			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000352622400033	25728521

A heterostructure containing both sulfide and oxide of Mo would be beneficial in achieving the desired bifunctional activity towards overall water splitting. A unique approach was adopted to design the Mo oxide/sulfide heterostructure with sufficient bifunctional activity. Interestingly, minimal doping of La was able to trigger further structural evolution in it. Elemental doping often caused changes in crystallographic features of materials, however; structural changes with such minimal doping was never achieved previously. La doping accompanied with structural evolution was proven to be beneficial for the heterostructure in achieving superior activity. The doped heterostructure with optimized physicochemical features achieved 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting at 1.58 V, which was 100 mV lower than that required for the RuO2-Pt/C couple. This investigation had opened up a new dimension in designing heterostructure-based bifunctional electrocatalyst through minimal-rare-earth-metal-doping-induced structural evolution.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000729145600004

It is believed thatthe corrosion intermediates formed during cathodic polarization areextremely short-lived species because of their high reactivity. Togetherwith the concurrent vigorous hydrogen evolution, this makes it challengingto investigate the reaction mechanism and detect the intermediatesexperimentally. From a computational standpoint, the process also presentsa serious challenge as it occurs at rather low negative potentials inconcentrated alkaline solutions. Here, we use density-functional-theorycalculations to elucidate the identity of reaction intermediates and theirreactivity at the Pt(111)/electrolyte interface. By controlling the electrodepotential in an experimentally relevant region through constant Fermi-level molecular dynamics, we reveal the formation of alkalication-stabilized Pt hydrides as intermediates of cathodic corrosion.

Impressively, the total platinum content in the hybrid catalyst is merely about 0.095 wt%. More importantly, this reported strategy can be readily extended to design other high-performance platinum-based nanomaterials for applications in catalysis and energy conversion.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000386310600005

In recent years, a commercially available 3D-printing graphene/polylactic acid (PLA) filament has been extensively utilised to fabricate electrodes for electrochemical applications. However, it has been reported that this commercial filament and hence the electrodes contain inherent impurities. Herein, these 3D-printed electrodes that contain such impurities are tailored as catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation reaction depending on the post 3D-printing treatment (i.e. solvent or thermal based). Our results show that the thermally treated 3D-printed electrode has superior HER and PEC water oxidation properties compared to the bare and the solvent treated 3D-printed electrodes. The optimum performance of the thermally treated 3D-printed graphene/PLA electrode for the HER is linked to the presence of Fe and Ti impurities and the low carbon to oxygen ratio content. Additionally, for the PEC water oxidation, the increased performance for the same electrode is linked to the presence of TiO2 on the electrode surface. Hence, researchers in this field should be cautious about the presence of metal impurities in this commercial graphene/PLA filament and its crucial effect on electrocatalysis.									40	1	0	0	7	2	41			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000508855700017

This is the first report for the synthesis of aluminum oxide nanorods where water has been used as solvent as well as a source of oxygen. The diameters of nanorods are relatively uniform, ranging from 40-60 nm with length of several micrometers. A plausible mechanism is proposed for the formation of these nanorods and is expected that this synthetic technique can be extended to obtain other metal oxides. Photoluminescence measurements reveal a blue luminescence band with two peaks at 310 and 420 nm, which could be attributed to F+ centers. The reported method is new, economical, fast and free of pollution, which will make it suitable for large scale production.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0217-9849	1793-6640		WOS:000267061300012

Au(1 1 1) was modified by palladium nanoislands spontaneously deposited using PdSO4 center dot 2H(2)O and PdCl2 salts. As revealed from both surface topography Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and phase AFM images, for the same deposition conditions, the obtained Pd/Au(1 1 1) nanostructures differ depending on the counter anion in the depositing palladium salt. These differences are reflected on their catalytic activity toward HER, which occurs between the potentials for pure consisting metals. HER proceeded with the same mechanism, but it is shifted to more positive potentials for Pd/Au(1 1 1) nanostructures obtained using PdCl2 salt with respect to ones obtained using PdSO4 salt. Better catalytic activity of Pd/Au(1 1 1) nanostructures obtained using PdCl2 salt can be explained by their surface structure consisting of smaller and thinner Pd nanoislands, preferentially deposited at steps, which provides more Pd and Pd/Au sites suitable for hydrogen evolution reaction.

Here, we doped NiCo catalyst with non3d metals molybdenum (Mo) for improvement in catalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction. The ternary catalyst was readily obtained by a one-pot process via the sequential electrodeposition of Ni, Co, and Mo precursors on titanium (Ti) support. By tailing the deposition conditions, we fabricated NiCoMo catalysts with three-dimensional dendritic structures, exhibiting large amounts of electrochemically active sites. To attain the benchmark HER current density of -10 mA cm(-2), an overpotential of similar to 132 mV is required in 0.1 M KOH for the Mo-doped NiCo (5 atom % Mo in bath), and they produced the decreasing in Tafel slope of similar to 108 mV decade(-1) exceeding those of binary NiCo alloy catalysts and other contents of Mo doping. In a synergistic effect, dopant incorporation of Mo element may provide near-optimal adsorption energies for HER intermediates promoting the process of water dissociation and hydrogen intermediates production and binding into molecular hydrogen.									62	5	0	0	0	0	64			1944-8244			WOS:000412256700003	28530387

The reduction was conducted by thermal annealing of the Co2RhO4 nanotubes under hydrogen gas flow. The crystallinity of the prepared RhCo alloy nanotubes depended on the reduction temperature: amorphous phase (200 degrees C reduction) and the crystalline phase (300 degrees C reduction). The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on RhCo alloys was investigated with voltammetry in 1.0 M HClO4 solution. Amorphous RhCo alloys provided lower overpotential than the crystalline counterpart despite their similar morphology and composition. Of great interest, amorphous RhCo alloy nanotubes exhibited an outstanding HER electroactivity verified with a low overpotential at -10 mA cm(-2) (-22 mV) and a small Tafel slope (-24.1 mV dec(-1)), outperforming commercial Pt, pure Rh metal, and the other previously reported Rh-based catalysts. This excellent HER activity of amorphous RhCo nanotubes was attributed to the amorphous structure having a large electrochemical surface area and maximized Rh-Co interfaces in the alloy facilitating HER Active but expensive Rh alloyed with less active but cheap Co was successfully demonstrated as a potential cost-effective HER catalyst.									18	0	0	0	0	0	19			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000503918300051	31815407

As expected, the resulting hybrid materials effectively inhibit the aggregation of nanoparticles and possess the enhanced intrinsic conductivity, leading to exposure of more active sites and the faster electron transport. And then these beneficial effects enable Co-Ni0.85Se/RGO efficient HER catalytic activity in both acid and basic electrolytes, achieving small overpotentials of 148 and 128 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5M H2SO4 and 1.0M KOH, respectively.									29	2	0	0	2	0	29			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000487838900085

The design and exploration of earth-abundant OER electrocatalysts with low cost, high-performance, and durability are of paramount importance. Nanoarray catalysts constructed on free-standing carbon substrates have drawn significant attention owing to their high conductivity, fascinating nanostructures, and abundant active sites. This review presents recent progress toward advanced self-supported catalysts for the OER. We have systematically overviewed diverse synthetic approaches for the preparation of self-supported electrocatalysts with selected examples of metal oxides, metal hydroxides/oxyhydroxides, metal phosphides, metal sulfides, metal selenides, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivatives. State-of-the-art strategies to improve OER catalytic activity and stability of self-supported catalysts are provided including interface and defect engineering as well as heteroatom-doping.

The effects of SSC ionomer content in CL for oxygen evolution reaction were studied in half cell with cyclic voltammetry and steady state linear sweep. In a single cell test the MEA with SSC-PFSA Aquivion (R) ionomer exhibited better thermal stability than the one with LSC-PFSA Nafion (R) ionomer at 90 degrees C. The cell voltage at a current density of 1 A cm(-2) was 1.63 V at 90 degrees C using the SSC-PFSA Aquivion (R) ionomer binder, Nafion (R) 117 membrane, and without back pressurizing. In a continuous operation the cell voltage degradation rate of the MEA using Aquivion (R) ionomer binder was only about 0.82 mV h(-1). Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Herein, a simple, environmental friendly and low-cost method was proposed to fabricate nitrogen-doped carbon-coated TiN nanoparticle composites (TiN@NC). Dicyandiamide was applied as the nitrogen source instead of ammonia reduction, based on which Ti0.95Co0.05N@NC was synthesized. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) measurement shows that the onset potential of Ti0.95Co0.05N@NC was 30 mV higher compared to TiN@NC, which is attributed: (i) Cobalt was doped into TiN lattice. (ii) After cobalt doping, the graphitization degree of carbon was increased to facilitate electron transport. (iii) Controlling the reservation of nitrogen to form more N-C active sites in Ti0.95Co0.05N@NC may further promote the performance of ORR. The performance of the ZABs was effectively improved after cobalt doping. It is believed to make it more convenient to prepare binary transition metal nitride nanostructures.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000593458400004

Herein, a novel type of molybdenum diselenide decorated porous carbon fiber (MoSe2-PCF) composite has been reported for HER. Notably, the unique mesoporous structure of electrospun polystyrene (PS) fibers is perfectly duplicated via the in situ self-polymerization of dopamine by using PS fibers as the hard template, while porous carbon fibers are formed after the subsequent thermal annealing of polydopamine-coated PS fibers. Thus obtained porous carbon fibers exhibit largely improved surface area which could provide highly conductive framework for electron transport, being an ideal substrate for the decoration of MoSe2. With maximally exposed active edge sites from the perpendicularly orientated MoSe2 nanosheets, the MoSe2-PCF composite exhibits high catalytic activity toward HER, holding great potentials as highly efficient metal-free electrodes for energy related applications.									19	1	0	0	2	0	19			2196-7350			WOS:000399031700003

The Li-7 and B-11 yields produced in a supernova explosion of a 16.2 M-circle dot star model increase by factors of 1.9 and 1.3 in the case of the large mixing angle solution with a normal mass hierarchy and sin (2)2 theta(13) greater than or similar to 2 x 10(-3) compared with those without the oscillations. In the case of an inverted mass hierarchy or a nonadiabatic 1-3 mixing resonance, the increment of their yields is much smaller. Neutrino oscillations raise the reaction rates of charged-current nu-process reactions in the region outside oxygen-rich layers. The number ratio of Li-7/B-11 could be a tracer of a normal mass hierarchy and a relatively large theta(13), still satisfying sin (2)2 theta(13) <= 0.1, through future precise observations in stars having strong supernova components.									45	0	0	0	0	0	45			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000240655000024

When an electrically contiguous similar to 9 nm thick RuO2 nanoskin is expressed on commercially. available, insulating SiO2 fiber paper, the RuO2@SiO2 electrode exhibits high current density at low overpotential (10 mA cm(-2) @ eta = 280 mV), courtesy of a catalyst amplified in 3D; however, the mass-normalized activity falls short of that achieved for films deposited on planar, metallic substrates (Ti foil). By wrapping the fibers with a <100 nm thick graphitic carbon layer prior to RuO2 deposition,(RuO2@C@SiO2), we retain the high mass activity of the RuO2 (40-60 mA mg(-1)@ eta = 330 mV) and preserve the desirable macroscale properties of the 3D scaffold: porous, lightweight, flexible, and inexpensive. The RuO2@C@SiO2 anodes not only achieve the 10 mA cm(-2) figure of merit at a low overpotential (eta = similar to 270 mV), but more importantly they do so while (1) minimizing the mass of catalyst needed to achieve this metric, (2) incorporating the catalyst into a practical electrode design, and (3) improving the long-term stability of the catalyst. Our best-performing anodes achieve state-of-the-art or better performance on the basis of area and mass, and do so with a catalyst density 300-580x less than that of bulk RuO2. By limiting the oxidizing potential required to evolve O-2 at the electrode, even at 10 mA cm(-2), we achieve stable activity for 100+ h.									40	1	0	0	1	0	40			1944-8244			WOS:000392909500046	28006096

With the exception of the N-terminal 12 amino acid extension, which has a phosphorylatable threonine, the eukaryotic polypeptide is 78% homologous to its bacterial counterpart. Biochemical characterization of this mutant shows that it expresses the engineered gene correctly and is competent for photoautotrophic growth. Fluorescence analysis and oxygen evolution measurements in the presence of exogenous accepters indicate that the observed phenotype results from a chimaeric PSII rather than from the absence of function associated with PsbH, suggesting that the heterologous protein is assembled into a functional PSII. Inhibition of oxygen evolution by herbicides belonging to different classes shows that the sensitivity of the mutant PSII is changed only towards phenolic compounds. This result indicates slight conformational modification of the Q(B)/herbicide binding pocket of the D1 polypeptide caused by the bulky PsbH protein in the mutant, and also suggests close structural interaction of the D1 and PsbH subunits in the topological arrangement of PSII.									24	0	0	0	24	0	24			0014-2956			WOS:000079371200030	10103014

This oxidizing equivalent was sensitive to low concentrations of exogenous Mn2+, and its stable accumulation was reversibly inhibited by diethylpyrocarbonate treatment that modifies histidine residues with high specificity. It was inferred that there is a photooxidizable histidine residue(s) on donor side of PSII and it provides a redox-active ligand for Mn.									63	0	0	0	52	0	63			0014-5793			WOS:A1991EX38500012	1991510

But this electrochemical treatment can introduce oxygen functional groups into the graphite lattice. Further disposal will require the development of safe and cost-effective methods to achieve the reduction and deoxygenation of the oxidized graphite wastes. In general, oxygen species can be removed from oxidized graphite directly in an easy-to-operate way by thermal annealing. In this paper, the thermal reduction process of oxidized graphite from the electro-oxidation processing of graphite matrix from simulative element of HTGR was researched. The thermodynamic state and kinetic process of the deoxygenation reaction of electrolytic graphite oxide (EGO) have also been investigated for better understanding of the reduction mechanism. According to thermal analysis results, the oxygen functional groups were removed mostly between 160 degrees C and 250 degrees C, and the main weight loss of EGO during thermal annealing was caused by evolved volatile gases (CO2, CO and H2O). The activation energy of deoxygenation reaction for EGO is calculated to be 115.6 kJ mol(-1) (1.20 eV per atom). And the persistent residual oxygen species on reduced EGO (REGO) is determined to be from two parts, i.e. the stubborn built-in oxygen species of pristine nuclear graphite and the newly formed C-O moieties on the basal plane of graphite sheet during thermal annealing process. In addition, an attempt was also made to elucidate how the thermal treatment acted on the electronic structure of EGO. Meanwhile, the mechanism of dissociation of oxygen species (-OH, C-O-C, C=O, -COOH) on the thermal reduction of oxidized graphite has been suggested in this paper.									25	0	0	0	1	0	25				2046-2069		WOS:000419187600063

In this study, a compound electrocatalyst composed of nickel-vanadium sesquioxide nanoparticles supported on porous nickel foam (Ni-V2O3/NF) is found to exhibit electrocatalytic performance towards HER that is superior to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst, with nearly zero onset overpotential, an extremely low overpotential of 25 mV to obtain a current density of -10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 58 mV dec(-1), and a good durability for 24 h in 1.0 m KOH. Theoretical calculations reveal that the presence of V2O3 optimizes the electronic structure of active Ni components and continuously accelerates the dissociation of water molecules, which in turn improves the HER kinetics. The present work will advance the development of highly efficient nanocomposite electrocatalysts for alkaline water electrocatalysis.									9	1	0	0	1	0	9			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000495998000001	31642194

The surface morphology and microstructure of the deposited coatings were investigated by use of an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry and scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). The electrochemical properties of the deposited thin coatings were examined by cyclic voltammetry, potentiodynamic polarization scan and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The service life cycle of the applied coatings was evaluated under electrolysis at a constant current density of 1 A cm(-2) in 1 M sulfuric acid (H2SO4) solution. The role of cobalt oxide (Co3O4) in the electrocatalytic activity and stability of IrO2-Ta2O5 coating are discussed. A small amount of Co3O4 resulted in improving the life cycle of the IrO2Ta2O5 anode in the 1 M H2SO4 solution due to dense nature coating. Meanwhile, the Co3O4 had no significant contribution to the electrochemical measurements.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0257-8972			WOS:000486360000081

Here we report the synthesis of oxygen-containing nitrogen-doped carbon (ONC) nanosheets through the carbonization of a mixture that contained glucose and dicyandiamide (DCDA). In situ formed graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) derived from DCDA provided a nitrogen-rich template, thereby facilitating the formation of ONC nanosheets. The resultant ONC materials with high nitrogen content, high specific surface areas, and highly mesoporous total volume displayed excellent electrochemical performance, including a similar ORR onset potential, half-potential, a higher diffusion-limited current, and excellent tolerance to methanol than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst, respectively. Moreover, the ONC-850 nanosheet displayed high long-term durability even after 1000cycles as well as a high electron transfer number of 3.92 (4.0 for Pt/C). Additionally, this work provides deeper insight into these materials and a versatile strategy for the synthesis of cost-effective 2D N-doped carbon electrocatalysts.									32	1	0	0	1	0	32			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000405719100021	28493381

The capping agent in the reaction was found to be crucial on the formation of the porous spinel cobalt manganese oxides from cubic Co2MnO4 nanorods to tetragonal CoMn2O4 microspheres and tetragonal CoMn2O4 cubes, respectively. All of the prepared spinel materials exhibit brilliant oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis along with high stability. In particular, the cubic Co2MnO4 nanorods show the best performance with an onset potential of 0.9 V and a half-wave potential of 0.72 V which are very close to the commercial Pt/C. Meanwhile, the cubic Co2MnO4 nanorods present superior stability with negligible degradation of their electrocatalytic activity after a continuous operation time of 10,000 seconds, which is much better than the commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst.									51	9	0	0	1	0	52			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000371797800017

Since HSs contain many phenolic and quinonic moieties and cause growth reductions in eco-physiological field experiments, HSs are considered photosystem II herbicides. To test this specific mode of action in vivo and in vitro, respectively, we used intact cells of the green alga Desmodesmus armatus, as well as thylakoids isolated from spinach (Spinacia oleracea) as a model system for the green algal chloroplast. Photosynthetic electron transport was measured as oxygen evolution and variable chlorophyll fluorescence. The in vivo effect of the artificial humic substance HS1500 on algae consisted of no impact on photosynthesis-irradiance curves of intact green algae compared to untreated controls. In contrast, addition of HS1500 to isolated thylakoids resulted in light-induced oxygen consumption (Mehler reaction) as an in vitro effect. Fluorescence induction kinetics of HS-treated thylakoids revealed a large static quenching effect of HS1500, but no inhibitory effect on electron transport. For the case of intact algal cells, we conclude that the highly hydrophilic and rather large molecules of HS1500 are not taken up in effective quantities and, therefore, cannot interfere with photosynthesis. The in vitro tests show that HS1500 has no inhibitory effect on photosystem II but operates as a weak, oxygen-consuming Hill acceptor at photosystem I. Hence, the results indicate that eco-physiological field experiments should focus more strongly on effects of HSs on extracellular features, such as reducing and red-shifting the underwater light field or influencing nutrient availability by cation exchange within the plankton network.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000445656000006	29777430

However, mixed populations of these intermediates and moderate resolution limit the interpretation of the data from current experiments. The S-3 XFEL structures show extra density near the OEC that may correspond to a water/hydroxide molecule. However, in the latest structure, this additional oxygen is 2.08 angstrom from the O epsilon 2 of D1-E189, which is closer than the sum of the van der Waals radii of the two oxygens. Here, we use Boltzmann statistics and Monte Carlo sampling to provide a model for the S-2-to-S-3 state transition, allowing structural changes and the insertion of an additional water/hydroxide. Based on our model, water/hydroxide addition to the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) is not thermodynamically favorable in the S-2 g = 2 state, but it is in the S-2 g = 4.1 redox isomer. Thus, formation of the S-3 state starts by a transition from the S-2 g = 2 to the S-2 g = 4.1 structure. Then, electrostatic interactions support protonation of D1-H190 and deprotonation of the Ca2+-ligated water (W3) with proton loss to the lumen. The W3 hydroxide moves toward Mn4, completing the coordination shell of Mn4 and favoring its oxidation to Mn(iv) in the S-3 state. In addition, binding an additional hydroxide to Mn1 leads to a conformational change of D1-E189 in the S-2 g = 4.1 and S-3 structures. In the S-3 state a fraction of D1-E189 release from Mn1 and bind a proton.									15	0	0	0	5	0	15			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000489984200027	31517382

In this work, a number of nitrogen-doped graphene (NGR) supported MoO2/MoW nitride alloy (MoWON/NGR) nanomaterials were prepared by co-impregnation and pyrolysis of graphene oxide (GO), phosphomolybdic acid (PMA), and phosphotungstic acid (PTA) hydrate under ammonia gas. The MoWON/NGR samples as prepared exhibited significantly high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities in acidic solution nearly to that of commercial Pt/C electrocatalysts, with an excellent stability. The high electrocatalytic activity of MoWON/NGR arises from numerous active sites, bimetallic effect of Mo-W, the inherited electrochemical properties, more accessible active sites, and modified electronic properties.

J	Zhou, Zhiming; Chen, Jinjin; Wang, Qinlong; Jiang, Xingxing; Shen, Yan								Enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting using a cobalt-sulfide-decorated BiVO4 photoanode								CHINESE JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				43	2			433	441		10.1016/S1872-2067(21)63845				FEB 2022	2022	Solar-driven water splitting is considered as a promising method to mitigate the energy crisis and various environmental issues. Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) is photoanode material with tremendous potential for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. However, its PEC performance is severely hindered owing to poor surface charge transfer, surface recombination at the photoanode/electrolyte junction, and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. In this regard, a novel solution was developed in this study to address these issues by decorating the surface of BiVO4 with cobalt sulfide, whose attractive features such as low cost, high conductivity, and rapid charge-transfer ability assisted in improving the PEC activity of the BiVO4 photoanode. The fabricated photoanode exhibited a significantly enhanced photocurrent density of 3.2 mA cm(-2) under illumination at 1.23 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode, which is more than 2.5 times greater than that of pristine BiVO4. Moreover, the CoS/BiVO4 photoanode also exhibited considerable improvements in the charge injection yield (75.8% vs. 36.7% for the bare BiVO4 film) and charge separation efficiency (79.8% vs. 66.8% for the pristine BiVO4 film). These dramatic enhancements were primarily ascribed to rapid charge-transport kinetics and efficient reduction of the anodic overpotential for oxygen evolution enabled by the surface modification of BiVO4 by CoS. This study provides valuable suggestions for designing efficient photocatalysts via surface modification to improve the PEC performance.

Herein, we present a simple synthesis strategy capable of concurrently realizing geometric confined growth and doping of transition metals within graphene hosts, demonstrated in Co,N-codoped graphene-confined FeNi nanoparticles (Co,N-GN-FeNi). The obtained Co,N-GN-FeNi can take full advantage of the hierarchy of interactions between the confined-grown FeNi nanoparticles (for high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity) and the Co,N-codoped graphene hosts (for high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity). The overall structure is a rationally designed synergy that simultaneously realizes (i) adequate exposure of electroactive sites, (ii) effective protection against corrosion/aggregation of FeNi nanoparticles, and (iii) rapid transport of ions/electrons between the interfaces. As a result, Co,N-GN-FeNi exhibits excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity relying on a low ORR/OER subtraction (Delta E = 0.81 V). Subsequent combination with a planar electrode configuration and a solid polymer electrolyte further demonstrates the utilization of Co,N-GN-FeNi as air cathode bifunctional electrocatalysts in a solid-state rechargeable micro-Zn-air battery (SR-MZAB), which exhibits a large open-circuit voltage of 1.39 V, a high power density/specific capacity of 62.3 mW cm(-2)/763 mAh g(-1), excellent durability (126 cycles/42 h), and mechanical flexibility. This work demonstrates an effective synthesis strategy for concurrently realizing geometric confined growth and doping of transition metals within carbon hosts, for enhanced bifunctional catalytic activity toward novel SR-MZABs with high energy efficiency, security, and flexibility for wearable micropower sources.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000566662000022	32799437

In this work, Os surface doping has been applied to Li1.2Ni0.13-Co0.13Mn0.54O2 for structural dimension gradient design of oxygen framework, inducing a surface heterostructure with three-dimensional Li/transition metal (TM) cations disorder. The octahedral coordination environment of surface oxygen transforms into a random and disordered distribution of Li/TM, differing from the two-dimensional ordered oxygen framework configuration inside the bulk. This promotes the three-dimensional disordered arrangement of O 2p unhybridized orbitals, and reduces the coplanar probability of those between adjacent O elements, thus effectively inhibiting the generation of O-O dimers under high voltage condition and the loss of surface oxygen. The high-stable interface alleviates the side reaction with electrolyte and the densification of structure, improves the Li+ diffusion migration kinetics and reduces the overpotential. Meanwhile, the occupancy and migration path of Li+ on the surface layer transforms from two-dimensional order into threedimensional disorder, which changes the thermodynamic reaction potential. The electrochemical performance particularly voltage attenuation and hysteresis are significantly improved by 2 at% Os doping. The average voltage attenuation per cycle is reduced by more than half from 2.17 mV to 1.01 mV during 300 cycles, and the voltage hysteresis between charge and discharge is reduced from 1.228 V to 0.733 V at the 300th cycle. This provides an idea for studying the mechanism of coordination environment of oxygen and the migration path of Li+ for cathode materials.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000728398200006

Parameters were set to represent a three-dimensional section of a bridge beam exposed to the atmosphere and coated with a thermally sprayed zinc anode. Both the diffusion of oxygen and the conduction of charge within the concrete were considered explicitly through a two-dimensional finite element model. The diffusivity and conductivity were represented as functions of concrete moisture content. Electrochemical reactions considered at the rebar-concrete interface included the reduction of oxygen, the oxidation of iron, and the evolution of hydrogen in a constant-potential CP circuit. Reaction-kinetic parameters for actively corroding steel (not passivated steel) were used. Reactions at the zinc-concrete interface were not considered explicitly. The effectiveness of protection was found to vary significantly with both concrete moisture content and position on the rebar. For spatially uniform pore saturation, the drier the concrete, the greater the corrosion current and the greater the nonuniformity. Protection was significantly more effective at the "front" of the rebar (closest to the zinc anode) than at the "back" (closest to the center of the beam). The corrosion current was greater under drying conditions than under wetting conditions. The numerical model was applied toward interpretation of the "100-mV polarization decay criterion" that is often used to assess the effectiveness of CP. It was found that the polarization decay predicted from relaxation of oxygen concentration gradients was comparable in magnitude to that observed experimentally, but depended on location on the rebar.									31	4	0	0	0	0	35			0010-9312	1938-159X		WOS:000229825900002

The SH samples were oxidized to different conversion degrees (0.15, 0.22, 0.32, 0.42, 0.52, 0.73, and 0.89) under an O-2 atmosphere, and the reductivity of each char sample was considerably enhanced after the preoxidative treatment. This phenomenon could be attributed to the generation of active sites and oxygen-containing complexes on the SH particle surface during the oxidation process. The preoxidized samples were obviously more reactive than the raw char, and per unit mass almost all the preoxidized samples could consume more NO than SH raw char under the same experimental conditions. The entire TPR process could be divided into the following four sections: (a) the reversible physical adsorption stage, (b) the heterogeneous reaction stage, (c) the multireaction stage, and (d) the equilibrium reaction stage. The primary reaction path at each stage could be summarized using the TPR and XPS results. The evolution of the C(N) and the variation in the elemental distribution (C, O, and N) during the TPR process were investigated by XPS. The results showed that N-Q was the most stable organic structure of the nitrogen-containing complexes on the particle, and the decomposition of N-6, N-5, and N-Q occurred when the reaction temperature reached 1173 K. The total amounts of N-Q, N-6, and N-5 decreased when the reaction temperature exceeded 1173 K, indicating interaction between the nitrogen-containing complexes occurred. Meanwhile, prior to the attachment of NO molecules to the char particle surface and forming C(N), more NO molecules were consumed by CO at this temperature. The results in this research clarified the effect of the conversion degree on the char reductivity and the primary reduction reaction path under different temperature conditions, providing a technical framework for the reducing process of air-staged combustion technology.									25	0	0	0	2	0	25			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000408178100103

MXenes have been rarely investigated as probable catalysts or catalyst supports for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this review, recent developments in experimental and theoretical research on MXene-based electrocatalysts for the ORR are examined. MXenes are known to have tremendous potential as stable supports for various Pt and non-Pt metals for electrocatalytic ORR processes. Theoretical analyses have determined several potential MXene candidates for applications as supports for Pt and non-Pt metal nanoparticles; experimental studies have shown that Pt- and non-Pt-deposited MXenes exhibit appreciable ORR activity and stability in alkaline media, followed by acidic media. However, experimental studies also indicate several limitations and challenges that must be addressed for efficient application of MXenes as supports for the ORR. Therefore, current research on MXenes with respect to the ORR is discussed, with a focus on synthesis strategies, ORR activities, and factors responsible for enhancing the electrocatalytic performance. Several strategies for the further development of efficient and durable ORR-based MXene catalysts are also proposed.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2196-7350			WOS:000714893700001

The radiation intensity and hence the molecule excitation efficiency have a spatially periodic modulation that leads to the formation of laser-induced gratings (LIGs) of the refractive index. The study of LIG temporal evolution allows collisional relaxation rates of molecular excited states and gas temperature to be determined. In this work, the b I-1 pound (g) (+) state of O-2 molecules deactivation rates are measured in a 4.3 vol % H-2 mixture at the number density of 2 amg in the temperature range 291-850 K. The physical deactivation is shown to dominate in the collisions of H-2 with O-2(b I-1 pound (g) (+) ) and O-2(a (1)Delta (g) ) up to temperatures of 780-790 K at time delays up to 10 mu s after the excitation pulse. The parameters of the obtained temperature dependence of the (b I-1 pound (g) (+) state deactivation rate agree well with the data of independent measurements performed earlier at lower temperatures (200-400 K). Tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy is used to measure the temperature dependence of the number density of the H2O molecules which appear as the mixture, as the result of the dark gross reaction with O-2 molecules in the ground state, O-2 + 2H(2) -> 2H(2)O. The measurements show that this reaction results in complete transformation of H-2 into H2O at temperatures of 790-810 K.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1063-7761	1090-6509		WOS:000323661900005

Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has been employed as a support to further improve the stability and activity of catalysts. However, the twinned structure is thermodynamically unstable due to the high total free energy, and it is difficult to control the shape of the crystals during preparation, especially when grown directly on the surface of rGO. Herein, multiply-twinned structural Au-Ag decahedra and icosahedra were grown directly in situ on rGO through a facile approach under microwave irradiation. Thanks to the synergy of abundant twin defects and the electronic effect of the intimate contact/interaction between the Au-Ag alloy and the rGO, these as-prepared Au-Ag NCs/rGO hybrids exhibit excellent activity and stability towards the hydrogen evolution reaction. In particular, Au-Ag icosahedra/rGO exhibits Pt-like electrocatalytic activity and enhanced stability compared to commercial Pt/C.									30	1	0	0	1	0	30			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000371967000034

The most appropriate technique for such investigations is a (stepwise) crushing method that is widely used for noble gases and nitrogen. However, because of the possible influence of mechanochemical reactions and back sorption, analyses of the isotope composition of water extracted by crushing from fluid inclusions are challenging. Methods An isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS)-based method for hydrogen (and oxygen) isotopic analysis in sub-microliter volumes of water extracted from fluid inclusions by crushing is presented. The verification of the possible influence of adsorption processes and mechanochemical reactions on the results of isotope analysis was performed for the first time. For that a series of parallel analyses of hydrogen isotopic ratios from water inclusions in quartz applying physically different extraction methods (crushing and thermodecrepitation) was conducted. Results Four series of quartz aliquots were analyzed: three series extracting water by crushing (two series for delta H-2 values and one for delta O-18 values) and one by thermodecrepitation. The mean value for the crushing results is delta H-2 = -85.3 +/- 3.6 parts per thousand (1 sigma,n = 11), which coincides well with the thermodecrepitation data (-86.3 +/- 2.0 parts per thousand, 1 sigma,n = 5), suggesting that our methodological approach allows the influence of back sorption or mechanochemical reactions during the crushing experiment to be minimized. The reproducibility of the oxygen isotopic ratios is +/- 0.9 parts per thousand (1 sigma,n = 5). Conclusions The conducted experiments have shown that the influence of back sorption or mechanochemical reactions during crushing on isotopic results is not crucial for our method. The developed IRMS-based method for hydrogen (and oxygen) isotopic analysis in sub-microliter volumes of water is well applicable for multi-isotope investigations of gases extracted from fluid inclusions. As an application a well-defined(40)Ar/Ar-36-delta H-2 correlation in mantle rocks is presented for the first time.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0951-4198	1097-0231		WOS:000583377300006	32779244

The anodic coatings' electrochemical characteristics were studied by electrochemical methods. The surface topography and the microstructure of the coatings were also studied. The results show that when the Ru-Ir-Ti oxide coating is coated with 30 layers (15.55 mu m), it has better adhesive force and better catalytic selectivity. Meanwhile, the coating's chlorine evolution potential, oxygen evolution potential and current efficiency are 1.02 V, 1.52 V and 94.5%, respectively. At the same time, the coating's cyclic voltammetry charge is up to 35 mC/cm(2) and its accelerated durability is about 525 h. When the coating layer number reaches up to 40 (22.6 mu m), the anodic coating has rough surface and poor binding force and the cracks on the coating surface become deeper and wider.									1	1	0	0	0	0	1			1002-185X			WOS:000317085900035

However, its performances at high temperature （above 50 ℃ ） is still not satisfied. In the present paper, the effect of erbium, used as the additive by different methods to prepare positive electrode, on the high temperature performances of the Ni-MH batteries was studied. It was found that the charge acceptance ability of the spherical Ni（OH）_2 electrode with element erbium as additivewas improved. The 1C charge/discharge efficiencies of the samples mechanically added with 1% （atomic fraction） Er_2O_3 and coated with 1% Er（OH）_3 were increased by 11.7% and 12.6% compared with the samples without erbium at 70 ℃. Cyclic voltammetry （CV） results indicated that the element erbium as additive could increase the overpotential of oxygen evolution at high temperature. The oxygen evolution reaction was effectively depressed and led to the higher efficiency of Co （ Ⅲ ）-coated Ni （ OH）_2 electrode at high temperature.			覆Co（Ⅲ）球镍具有优良的电化学性能，是镍氢动力电池较理想的活性材料，然而其高温性能仍待提高。本文研究了通过不同方式在覆Co（Ⅲ）球镍中添加铒改善镍电极的高温性能。结果表明，采用机械混合在球镍中添加1％（原子分数）Er_2O_3以及表面化学沉积方式在球镍表面包覆1％Er（OH）_3的电极70℃时1C充，放电效率分别比无添加的电极提高11．7％和12．6％。循环伏安测试表明，铒的添加提高了镍电极在高温下的析氧过电位，明显提高了电极在高温环境下的充电效率。						2	4	0	0	0	0	4			1000-4343			CSCD:3415332		
J	Andre, Marcel J.								Modelling O-18(2) and O-16(2) unidirectional fluxes in plants: II. Analysis of Rubisco evolution								BIOSYSTEMS				103	2	SI		252	264		10.1016/j.biosystems.2010.10.003				FEB 2011	2011	The studies of Rubisco characteristics observed during plant evolution show that the variation of the Rubisco specificity factor only improved by two times from cyanobacteria to modern C3 plants. However we note important variations of the ratio between the maximum rates of oxygenation and carboxylation (V-o/V-c). Modelling in vivo O-18(2) data in plant gas exchange shows that the oxygenation reaction of Rubisco plays a regulating role when the photochemical energy exceeds the carboxylation capacity. A protective index 'oxygenation capacity' is postulated, related to the ratio Vo/Vc of Rubisco, and hence to the sink energy effect of photorespiration. Analysing the trends of Rubisco parameters along the evolutionary scale, we show: (1) the increase of both V-c and V-o: (2) the enhancement of CO2 affinity: and (3) the rise in oxygenation capacity at the expense of the CO2 specificity. Hence, the factors of evolutionary pressure have not only directed the enzyme towards a more efficient utilisation of CO2, but mainly to positively use the unavoidable great loss of energy and assimilated carbon in the process of photorespiration. These observations reinforce the hypothesis of plant-atmosphere co-evolution and of the complex role of Rubisco, which seems to be selected to develop both better CO2 affinity and oxygenation capacity. The latter increases the capacity of sink of photorespiration, in particular, during water stress or under high irradiance, the two conditions experienced by plants in terrestrial environments. These observations help to explain some handicaps of C4 plants, and the supremacy of CAM and C3 perennial higher plants in arid environments. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The antibacterial effect of caffeic acid and of its oxidation derivatives was determined on four bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli). The bactericidal activity appears only after caffeic acid oxidation and in alkaline conditions.

However, the changes induced by the functionalization are not well understood. By using atomic sources to control the extent of the oxygen and nitrogen functionalization, we studied the evolution in the structure and properties at the atomic scale. Atomic oxygen reversibly introduces epoxide groups whilst, under similar conditions, atomic nitrogen irreversibly creates diverse functionalities including substitutional, pyridinic, and pyrrolic nitrogen. Atomic oxygen leaves the Fermi energy at the Dirac point (i.e., undoped), whilst atomic nitrogen results in a net n-doping; however, the experimental results are consistent with the dominant electronic effect for both being a transition from delocalized to localized states, and hence the loss of the signature electronic structure of graphene.									32	2	0	0	1	0	32			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000359865100015

Defect engineering is an effective method to improve the electrocatalytic ability of catalysts by regulating electronic structure and optimizing the binding energy with surface adsorbates. Herein, in this work we have successfully integrated metal vacancies and tensile strain into Co3O4. With the formation of metal vacancies, the electronic structure of Co3O4 has been regulated. Moreover, the d-band center of Co(3)O(4)has been modulated with the presence of tensile strain. The electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) ability of the obtained electrocatalyst was improved dramatically. The overpotential to reach 10 mA cm(-2) was only 327 mV. Reaction kinetics was rapidly facilitated as indicated by smaller Tafel slope and charge transfer resistance. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the relocated atoms induced the formation of tensile strain and made d-band center of electrocatalyst near to Fermi level leading to enhanced the adsorption to reaction intermediates. What's more, the free energy barrier of rate-determining step (RDS) has been decreased with the integration of metal vacancies and tensile strain. This work provides an efficient strategy to develop defective and effective electrocatalysts.

However, for some transition-metal oxides this limit can be broken and oxygen loss and/or oxygen redox reactions have been proposed to explain the phenomenon. We present operando mass spectrometry of O-18-labelled Li-1.2[Ni0.132+Co0.133+Mn0.544+]O-2, which demonstrates that oxygen is extracted from the lattice on charging a Li-1.2[Ni0.132+Co0.133+Mn0.544+]O-2 cathode, although we detected no O-2 evolution. Combined soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that, in addition to oxygen loss, Li+ removal is charge compensated by the formation of localized electron holes on O atoms coordinated by Mn4+ and Li+ ions, which serve to promote the localization, and not the formation, of true O-2(2-)( peroxide, O-O similar to 1.45 angstrom) species. The quantity of charge compensated by oxygen removal and by the formation of electron holes on the O atoms is estimated, and for the case described here the latter dominates.									686	36	1	0	52	0	696			1755-4330	1755-4349		WOS:000378280400012	27325095

With carbon-nanotube-templated polymerization, covalent porphyrin frameworks using FCoP-H can be synthesized via the Hay-coupling. The resulting FCoP@CNT is efficient to catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous media, and its performance is superior, in terms of both lower overpotentials and larger catalytic currents, to covalent porphyrin frameworks using non-fluorinated cobalt porphyrin analogues and also monomeric fluorinated cobalt porphyrins simply adsorbed on CNTs. This work combines the merits of CNT-templated covalent frameworks and fluorinated cobalt porphyrins to significantly improve the HER performance. This strategy is valuable to be explored in other electrocatalytic systems using molecule-engineered carbon materials.									33	4	0	0	1	0	33			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000490779100010	31580361

Here, we report the first example of cobalt-rich cobalt phosphide catalysts directly grown on cobalt foil (denoted as Co2P/Co-foil) as a novel non-noble metal and integrated electrode by one-step phosphorization of a pre-oxidized Co foil. Owing to the intrinsic catalytic properties of cobalt-rich cobalt phosphide and the intimate contact between Co2P and highly conductive Co foil, the resulting Co2P/Co-foil electrode exhibits excellent catalytic performances for both the HER and OER in basic solution, affording a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 157 mV for the HER and 319 mV for the OER, respectively. More importantly, these electrodes can be directly employed as both the anode and cathode in an alkaline electrolyzer, showing noble metal-like water splitting performances and long-term stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the sites on the top of the P atoms in Co2P are the most active sites for the HER. This work would open an exciting new avenue to synthesize other metal-rich metal phosphide catalysts on conductive metal foil as self-supported electrodes using this facile, cost-effective and easy scale-up fabrication method for overall water splitting.									103	8	0	0	5	0	104			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000402387900053

Herein, based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we found that doping F- can not only narrow the bandgap of graphitic-phase carbon nitride (g-C3N4), but also decrease the electronic localization, extend the pi conjugated system and increase the in-planar electron density, resulting in promoting the molecular oxygen activation of g-C3N4. The experiments indicated that the fluorinated ultrathin g-C3N4 was favorable for activating molecular oxygen into O-.(2)- under visible light irradiation, which could be ascribed to the relatively higher conduction band position and more negative surface adsorption energy for O-2 as well as advantageous charge accumulation on adsorbed O-2 as compared to ultrathin g-C3N4. By virtue of the synergic effect of enhanced adsorption ability to O-2, effective separation of photogenerated carriers and more reductive photoexcited electrons derived from the ultrathin structure and F- associates, the fluorinated ultrathin g-C3N4 sheets revealed promoted solar driven photocatalytic activity for formaldehyde (HCHO) oxidation. This study could provide new insights into the mechanistic comprehension of molecular oxygen activation reaction and design of low cost noble metal-free modified ultrathin layered photocatalysts with for environmental remediation.									51	5	0	0	10	0	53			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000441400000008

Hydrogen used in fuel cells can be derived from electrolyzersviaa green energy mechanism. Platinum group metals (PGMs) are widely used in the fabrication of fuel cells and electrolyzers, which are in turn employed in electrocatalysing reactions such as the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This work sought to develop efficient electrocatalysts for the OER and ORR based on the combination of Ni and Co oxides with or without NiCo2O4, blended with or without graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and containing a low content of Pt. Among the electrocatalysts investigated, crystalline NiCo(2)O(4)was found to be the best and most stable electrocatalyst for the OER; the enhancement of the electrocatalytic properties of this catalyst was associated with the synergistic effects of binary metal ions, such as Co2+, Co3+, Ni2+, and Ni3+(transition metals intercalated across the nanostructures). Similarly, PtCoNi/GNR was found to be the best and most stable electrocatalyst for the ORR; the improvement observed in the ORR properties of this catalyst was attributed to three factors: (i) the presence of Pt(0)and Pt(2+)metal/ions in the CoNi/GNR nanocomposites; (ii) the synergistic effects of Pt metal/ions with binary metal ions such as Co2+, Co3+, Ni2+, and Ni3+(transition metals intercalated across the nanostructures); and (iii) the metal/ions-support interactions (geometric effects and charge transfer-that produce electron-deficient Pt(delta+)species, resulting from strong interaction between Pt and Co and Ni hydroxides/oxides at the PtCoNi/GNR nanocomposite interface). The PtCoNi/GNR '/GC electrode was developed using a low content of Pt (22.5 mu g(Pt)cm(-2)).									38	2	0	0	1	0	39			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000566092600032

CHEMPHOTOCHEM				3	1			10	23		10.1002/cptc.201800144				JAN 2019	2019	The photocatalytic splitting of water into molecular hydrogen and molecular oxygen with sunlight is the dream reaction for solar energy conversion. For decades, transition metal oxide semiconductors and supramolecular organometallic structures have been extensively explored as photocatalysts for solar water splitting. More recently, polymeric materials consisting of triazine or heptazine building blocks have attracted considerable attention as hydrogen-evolution photocatalysts. The mechanism of hydrogen evolution with these materials is discussed throughout the current literature in terms of the familiar concepts developed for photoelectrochemical water splitting with semiconductors since the 1970s. We discuss in this Minireview an alternative mechanistic paradigm for photoinduced water splitting with carbon nitrides, which focusses on the specific features of the photochemistry of aromatic N-heterocycles in aqueous environments. Using ab initio electronic-structure calculations, it is shown that a water molecule which is hydrogen-bonded to an N-heterocycle can be decomposed into hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals by two simple sequential photochemical reactions. This concept is illustrated by the discussion of excited-state reaction paths and their energy profiles for hydrogen-bonded complexes of pyridine, triazine and heptazine with a water molecule. It is shown that the excited-state hydrogen-transfer and hydrogen-detachment reactions are essentially barrierless, in sharp contrast to water oxidation in the electronic ground state, where high barriers prevail. We also discuss in some detail the products of possible reactions of the highly reactive photogenerated hydroxyl radicals with the chromophores. We hypothesize that the challenge of efficient solar hydrogen generation with carbon nitride materials is less the decomposition of water as such, but rather the controlled recombination of the photogenerated radicals to the closed-shell products H-2 and H2O2.									25	1	0	0	1	0	25			2367-0932			WOS:000455954500003

The remarkable photocatalytic performance of MnFe2O4/g-C3N4 heterojunction was resulted from the charge transfer mechanism switch (from type II to Z-scheme) induced by the synergistic effect of oxygen vacancies and pyrrolic N after urea treatment. The increased pyrrolic N was conductive to photoinduced electron transfer while the oxygen va-cancies provided a higher fraction of surface-active sites for H-2 evolution, which was metabolized in-situ with bicarbonate by S. marcescens Q1 to yield acetate via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. This study provides a simple and feasible strategy for switching the photocatalytic charge transfer in a spinel-based heterojunction and offers new insights for ingeniously synthesizing photocatalysts with high CO(2 )conversion in MES.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000783882400001

AbstractRational design of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts is highly imperative but still a challenge for overall water splitting. Herein, we construct novel freestanding Mo-doped NiCoP nanosheet arrays by the hydrothermal and phosphation processes, serving as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. Notably, Mo doping could effectively modulate the electronic structure of NiCoP, leading to the increased electroactive site and improved intrinsic activity of each site. Furthermore, an electrochemical activation strategy is proposed to form Mo-doped (Ni,Co)OOH to fully boost the electrocatalytic activities for oxygen evolution reaction. Benefiting from the unique freestanding structure and Mo doping, Mo-doped NiCoP and (Ni,Co)OOH show the remarkable electrochemical performances, which are competitive among current researches. In addition, an overall water splitting device assembled by both electrodes only requires a cell voltage of 1.61V to reach a current density of 10mAcm(-2). Therefore, this work opens up new avenues for designing nonprecious bifunctional electrocatalysts by Mo doping and in situ electrochemical activation.									72	7	0	0	2	0	72			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000475676200001	34138017

However, the single function, poor performances, and restriction of electrolyte pH value have restricted their further development. Here, morphological and interfacial engineering of cobalt nanoparticles, are performed by the incorporation of carbon dots (CDs). Typically, the nitrogen-doped carbon-encapsulated cobalt nano particles (N-C@Co NPs) were in situ constructed for electrocatalytic overall water splitting, exhibiting superior hydrogen evolution performances in both acid and alkaline media with the overpotential of 137 and 134 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2), respectively, and excellent oxygen evolution performances in alkaline media with the overpotential of 353 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2). Such performances outperform the majority of previously reported Co-based electrocatalysts and are comparable to many excellent nonprecious metal based electrocatalysts. It is found that CDs have significant impact on fabricating a distinct morphology of catalysts and bonding structure between N-C and Co NPs, and synergistic effects between the N-C and Co NPs for water splitting are revealed. Furthermore, as a proof concept, the proposed strategy was further verified by CDs-decorated cobaltosic oxide nanoparticles (CDs@Co3O4 NPs) with enhanced OER activities (a overpotential of 304 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2)). This work provides an approach for the synthesis of various stable metal-based carbon hybrids with high-performance photo/electrocatalystic activities.									49	4	0	0	3	0	49			2168-0485			WOS:000463462100064

Extensive structural searches show that all the ground-state structures of (WO3)(n)(+) (n = 1-4) contain an oxygen radical center with a lengthened W-O bond which is highly active in the oxidation of carbon monoxide. Energy profiles are calculated to determine the reaction mechanisms and evaluate the effect of cluster sizes. The monomer WO3+ has the highest reactivity among the stoichiometric clusters of different sizes (WO3)(n)(+) (n = 1-4). The reaction mechanisms for CO with mono-nuclear stoichiometric tungsten oxide clusters with different charges (WO3-/0/+) are also studied to clarify the influence of charge states. Our calculated results show that the ability to oxidize CO gets weaker from WO3+ to WO3+ as the negative charge accumulates progressively.									8	1	0	0	0	0	9			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000353338800043	25854200

When the thin films were exposed to humid atmosphere, nano- or micro-scale boric acid structures were observed to grow spontaneously. Depending on the relative humidity, temperature, and exposure time to the humid atmosphere, these boric acid structures were either nanotubes, nanotips, nanorods, microtubes, or microtips. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies on the thin film surface suggested that the thin films contained B2O3, BCO2, and C-C clusters. The relative amounts of boron, carbon, and oxygen in the thin films were about 41.3, 14, and 43.9% respectively. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) results indicated that the elemental distribution of boron, carbon, and oxygen in the thin films was rather homogeneous. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to study the time evolution of these boric acid structures at 23 degreesC and 45 +/- 3% relative humidity. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the structures showed that the boric acid tubes and tips had a hollow structure, whereas the boric acid rods were solid. The boric acid structures dehydrated into similarly shaped amorphous structures in a vacuum. In-situ X-ray diffraction studies in a vacuum showed that at 23 degreesC and 45 +/- 3% relative humidity (at one atmosphere pressure), the dissociation rate law of the boric acid structures at 250 and 500 mTorr was [-ln(1 -alpha)](1/2) = kt; whereas at 1000 mTorr, the dissociation rate law was [-ln(1 - alpha)] = kt, where a, k, and t were the fraction of decomposed reactant, the reaction rate constant, and the time, respectively.									37	2	0	0	0	0	37			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000184838300010

In this work, mesoporous composites of nitrogen-doped carbon fibers (NCFs) decorated with cobalt nanoparticles have been successfully fabricated via the combination of a mussel-inspired biomimetic polydopamine (PDA)-coating process using electrospun porous polystyrene fibers as templates, a simple solution deposition method and subsequent high-temperature carbonization. This rationally designed porous NCF-Co composite possesses a large surface area and numerous electrochemically active sites, which exhibits synergistically improved catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) with a relatively positive onset potential, large current density, as well as superior durability compared with the commercial platinum-carbon (Pt/C) catalyst, making it a promising noble-metal-free catalyst for practical ORR applications.									59	0	0	0	1	0	59			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000365216000027

In this work, two different hard coals (bituminous and anthracite) have been modified via carbonisation and oxidation and their electrochemical behaviour has been compared in an electrolyte supported HDCFC. A new insight into the HDCFC reaction mechanism is presented, providing an exhaustive analysis taking into account not only the evolution of the properties of the coals upon treatment but also other relevant parameters such as the effect of the cell preparation step or the interaction of the coal with the other cell components. The results show that the carbon content, the carbonaceous structure and the reactivity of the coals are key characteristics for optimal electrochemical behaviour. The plasticity of bituminous coals, an important parameter overlooked in previous works, can help to extend the area for electrochemical reactions beyond the current collector/anode interface. The reaction mechanism proposed shows that additional gas phase electrochemical reactions are an important contribution during the early stages of the electrochemical testing and that the direct electrochemical oxidation of solid carbon is the dominant reaction at longer times.									35	1	0	0	1	0	35			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000382746300014

The samples were subjected to various calcination temperatures in order to investigate the physicochemical properties of the oxide affected by the parameter. Samples were characterized by XRD, TG/DTA, IR, laser granulometry and cyclic voltammetry. By imposing various calcination temperatures, phase evolutions were observed. However, the calcination temperature affects significantly the particle size and catalytic activity of the oxide at higher temperature. Oxygen evolution shows that the current density at 1,050 A degrees C is five times greater than at 950 A degrees C. From these results, the best calcination temperature can be chosen to arrive at the effective catalyst necessary for the desired catalytic reaction.									29	0	0	0	3	0	29			2193-567X	2191-4281		WOS:000329940300017

Because of their tunable compositions and diverse structures, polyoxometalates (POMs) are promising catalytic components and are promising precursors for the fabrication of early transition metal-based materials, especially for Mo and W, for hydrogen and oxygen evolution electrocatalysis. By incorporating POMs into metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) , the target POM/MOF will promote the dispersion of POMs and increase the compositional and structural complexity of the derived materials. In this review, recent relevant research fruits focusing on POM/MOF composites and their derivatives (such as carbides, oxides, phosphides, sulfides, and selenides) are summarized. Their designable synthesis, structure modulation, and electrocatalytic performance in HER and OER are highlighted to figure out the structure-property relationship. The existing problems of POM/MOF materials and their derivatives in electrocatalysis are also discussed. Then we propose the future prospective, providing a brand new vision of design and development of other POM/MOF-based/derived advanced electrocatalysts for water splitting. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

As a measure of fluorescence, Fv/Fm, and for the photosynthetic yield, Delta F/Fm' were used. Oxygen measurements show clearly that the observed degree, as well as the time course, of photoinhibition depends on the fluence rate of the light used to measure changes of the production rate. After photoinhibition inhibition of photosynthesis the depression of oxygen production caused by non-saturating fluence rates was generally much more pronounced than that caused by saturating or nearly saturating fluence rates. At minimal photoinhibition the initial slope and the convexity of the fluence rate-response curve of oxygen evolution decrease, whereas the level of light saturation decreases only after strong photoinhibition. Nevertheless, at different degrees of photoinhibition, changes in the degree of the upper bending of the fluence rate-response curve of oxygen production are also linearly correlated to changes in the fluorescence ratios (Fv/Fm and Delta F/Fm'). The action spectrum of photoinhibition, calculated on the basis of changes of Fv/Fm, indicates that the reaction center of PS I is not involved in photoinhibition. The lower effectiveness of blue light in comparison to effects of green and red light may be due to chloroplast displacement, as in the so-called strong light position, the light absorbed by the thalli in vivo is decreased.									43	1	0	0	41	1	45			0932-8629			WOS:A1995QX30800007

We demonstrate that 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF, the predominant folate in plasma) is also a potent, near diffusion limited, scavenger of singlet oxygen and quencher of excited photosensitizers. Both pathways result in decomposition of 5-MTHF, although ascorbate can protect against this loss. In the absence of photosensitizers, 5-MTHF is directly decomposed only very slowly by UVA or UVB. Although synthetic folic acid can promote DNA damage by UVA, submicromolar 5-MTHF inhibits photosensitization-induced strand breaks. These observations suggest a new role for reduced folate in protection from ultraviolet damage and have bearing on the hypothesis that folate photodegradation influenced the evolution of human skin color.									39	0	0	0	28	0	39			0892-6638	1530-6860		WOS:000247500300019	17341682

However, precisely controllable synthesis of Ni-N/C nanostructures with large surface area and high volume of mesopores remains insurmountable challenge. In this work, a mesoporous nickel-nitrogen codoped carbon nanocube (denoted as Ni-N/C-NCs) catalyst with high specific surface area of 1085 m(2) g(-1) is illustrated. The high volume of mesopores is confirmed to not only allow the great exposure of highly active C-N site, but also facilitates the mass transfer and gas diffusion, resulting in promotion of ORR activity and kinetics. In 0.1 m KOH, a diffusion-limited current density of 6.61 mA cm(-2) is achieved, which is 20% higher than that of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C and superior to most catalysts reported to date. The Ni-N/C-NCs prepared by the new synthetic route not only show excellent ORR performance, but also exhibit high structural thermostability, which makes it a promising catalyst for industrial applications.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2196-7350			WOS:000484300400001

Building on 3D architectured electrocatalysts through structural and compositional engineering is an effective strategy to enhance catalytic activities as well as stability and durability. Herein, 3D architectures of quaternary Co-Ni-S-P compounds coupled with graphene ((Co1-xNix)(S1-yPy)(2)/G) electrocatalysts are proposed, in which nanosheets are self-assembled to form 3D architectures with round and flat doughnut-like shapes, toward overall water splitting. Benefiting from the 3D architectures and Ni, P substitution, (Co1-xNix)(S1-yPy)(2)/G exhibits superior electrocatalytic activities with low overpotentials of 117 and 285 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slopes of 85 and 105 mV dec(-1) for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively, in alkaline media. In addition, minimal increases in overpotential are observed, even after the 10 000th voltammetric cycle and continuous chronopotentiometric testing over 50-100 h, confirming the high stability and durability of (Co1-xNix)(S1-yPy)(2)/G. When used as both cathode and anode, (Co1-xNix)(S1-yPy)(2)/G achieves excellent overall water splitting performance with a cell potential as low as 1.65 V, reaching a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with no obvious decay after 50 h, demonstrating that (Co1-xNix)(S1-yPy)(2)/G is an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.									114	6	0	0	5	0	115			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000451181900016

Hence, we investigate the impact of stabilizers on the evolution of molecular structure of elastomers through photo-oxidation. While a dual processes is generally reported to describe photo-oxidation of elastomers (oxidation by-products formation and crosslinking), the aim of the current study is to provide a complete characterization of the efficiency of additives taking into account the dual processes: chemical changes (formation of photoproducts) and molecular structure changes (crosslinking).

Structural characterization of all the four complexes by single crystal X-ray diffraction study suggests distortion in regular square planar geometry at Ni(II) center by coordination with two phosphorus of the dppe and two sulfur of the dithiolate ligands, respectively. The decomposition of all four complexes have been done to produce nickel sulfides and the resulting nickel sulfides have been utilized for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The nickel sulfide obtained by decomposing Ni-cdc shows best activity with overpotential n = 222 mV at j = 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 44.2 mV dec(-1) while other catalysts shows n > 470 mV at j = 5 mA cm(-2) and eta > 600 mV at j = 10 mA cm(-2) at loading of 1.3 mg cm(-2).

The composite particles generated by this process are featured by a core-shell structure consisting of TiC inclusions and rutile shells, appearing as mono-disperse spherical particles. Local pores or hollow structures are present in the particles, and may be generated by the evolution of CO/CO2 gases at the oxygen front. The composite particles were formed by a liquid oxidation reaction that started at the particle surface with the oxidation front moving inwards the particles until the particles were quenched. The formation of the composite structure can be feasibly controlled by the oxygen input in the plasma sheath gases at a moderate oxygen flow rate. Because of the important functional properties of titanium oxide, such as the high photo-electronic conductivity and photo-catalysis activity, its composite with the refractory titanium carbide, which has a high thermal conductivity and high hardness, may generate new properties in this novel composite.					5th International Workshop on Interfaces of Ceramic Materials5th International Workshop on Interfaces of Ceramic Materials	OCT 21-25, 2001OCT 21-25, 2001	Natl Inst Mat & Chem Res; Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & TechnolNatl Inst Mat & Chem Res; Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol	Tsukuba, JAPANTsukuba, JAPAN	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1013-9826		*************	WOS:000228290200019

Purified CNW was used as precursor to carbon nanoneedles (CNN) synthesis. The synthesis of CNN loaded with different metals dopants were carried out by a nanoreactor method and the obtained CNNs applied as electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In the carbon nanoneedles synthesis, Ni, Cu, or Fe worked as graphitization catalyst and the metal were found present as dopants in the final material. The used metal appeared to have direct influence on the degree of organization of the particles and also in the surface density of polar groups. It was evaluated the influence of the graphitic organization on the general properties and nickel was found as the more appropriate metal since it leads to a more organized material and also to a high activity toward HER.

Herein, hierarchical CoxNiyFezP with precise control of stoichiometric metallic elements (x:y:z = (1-10):(1-10):1) has been synthesized, and Co1.3Ni0.5Fe0.2P, as the most optimal composition, exhibits remarkable catalytic activity (eta = 320 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and long-term stability (ignorable decrease after 10 h continuous test at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It is found that the surface P in Co1.3Ni0.5Fe0.2P was replaced by 0 under the OER process. The density function theory calculations before and after long-term stability tests suggest the clear increasing of the density of states near the Fermi level of Co1.3Ni0.5Fe0.2P/ Co1.3Ni0.5Fe0.2O, which could enhance the OH- adsorption of our electrocatalysts and the corresponding OER performance.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000805530000001	35668742

The pressure cell consists of a single-crystal sapphire tube which serves as both high-pressure container and reaction cell, with up to 6 mm inner diameter. The system can operate in two different configurations, under either static high pressure or dynamic pressurized flow. The transportable reaction cell can be filled under inert atmosphere inside a glove box, enabling studies with oxygen-sensitive compounds to be conducted. The five main benefits of this system can be summarized as follows: (i) the temperature, pressure and gas-flow ranges of 2981273 K, 10(-3) mbar-200 bar (0.1-2 x 10(7) Pa) and 0-1 l min(-1), respectively, (ii) the combination of different gases, (iii) the flexibility of the cell design, (iv) the full rotation of the pressurized cell, and (v) the combination of X-ray diffraction and mass spectrometry as analytical tools. These key points open new possibilities for studying the evolution of catalysts or compounds from a fundamental point of view as well as for industrial applications, in both cases in operando conditions.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1600-5767			WOS:000330485100033

Initial tungsten compacts containing 80 wt% micro powder and 20 wt% submicron particles (size of 100-600 nm) were sintered in hydrogen atmosphere. SEM, XRD and EDS analysis were used to studying the micro-structural details. The obtained results exhibited an interesting oxidation-condensation phenomenon in sintered specimens that resulted into formation of needle-like WO3 nanowires on the particle surfaces. Also, submicron particles accelerate the sintering of tungsten powders due to faceted-nonfaceted transformation mechanism. The obtained results proposed that oxygen content in initial powders can be considered as required oxygen source for nucleation and growth of WO3 nano-structure. In this condition, the nanowires extend via solid-phase growth from nanowire nuclei generated on the W particles surface.									2	0	1	0	0	0	2			0263-4368			WOS:000416501400011

Electron microprobe X-ray maps and major element profiles, in situ secondary ion mass spectrometry oxygen isotope analyses, and UPb and SmNd geochronology are used to reconstruct their thermal, temporal and fluid evolution. These techniques reveal a detailed sequence of garnet growth, re-equilibration and dissolution during intracontinental reworking associated with the OrdovicianCarboniferous (450300 Ma) Alice Springs Orogeny. A euhedral garnet porphyroblast displays bell-shaped major element profiles diagnostic of prograde growth zoning during shear zone burial. Coexisting granulitic garnet porphyroclasts inherited from precursor wall rocks show extensive cation re-equilibration assisted by fracturing and fragmentation. Oxygen isotope variations in the former are inversely correlated with the molar proportion of grossular, suggesting that isotopic fractionation is linked to Ca substitution. The latter generally show close correspondence to the isotopic composition of their precursor, indicating slow intergranular diffusion of O relative to Fe2+, Mg and Mn. Peak metamorphism associated with shearing (similar to 550 degrees C; 5.06.5 kbar) occurred at c. 360 Ma, followed by rapid exhumation and cooling. Progressive Mn enrichment in rim domains indicates that the retrograde evolution caused partial garnet dissolution. Accompanying intra-mineral porosity production then stimulated limited oxygen isotope exchange between relict granulitic garnet grains and adjacent metasomatic biotite, resulting in increased garnet d18O values over length scales <200 mu m. Spatially restricted oxygen interdiffusion was thus facilitated by increased fluid access to reaction interfaces. The concentration of Ca in channelled fracture networks suggests that its mobility was enhanced by a similar mechanism. In contrast, the intergranular diffusion of Fe2+, Mg and Mn was rock-wide under the same PT regime, as demonstrated by a lack of local spatial variations in the re-equilibration of these components. The extraction of detailed reaction histories from garnet must therefore take into account the variable length- and time-scales of elemental and isotopic exchange, particularly where the involvement of a fluid phase enhances the possibility of measureable resetting profiles being generated for slowly diffusing components such as Ca and O, even at low ambient temperatures and relatively fast cooling rates.									33	1	0	0	0	0	34			0263-4929			WOS:000301112400002

N-Coordination protection and low-temperature pyrolysis are the two key factors for the formation of CoNx single clusters on nanocarbon supports. Morphological and structural identification confirmed the simultaneous anchoring of homo-dispersed CoNx single clusters and N-doping on the nanocarbon under relatively mild thermal treatment conditions. Expectedly, the obtained single cluster catalyst with a trace amount of metal atoms exhibited excellent ORR performance including a positive half-wave potential (0.846 V), a high mass activity (0.98 A mg(Co)(-1), ampere per milligram of cobalt) and outstanding chemical durability after 8000 potential cycles. We believe that our findings provide a new route for the rational design of low-cost and highly active ORR catalytic materials.									41	4	0	0	3	0	42			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000403943600035	28593211

The flame-like Ni(OH)(2)/NF exhibited efficient activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media, requiring overpotentials of only 56.4 and 115.8 mV to reach current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, with a low Tafel slope of 52.8 mV dec(-1). These results are nearly comparable to those of commercial Pt/C. The significant improvement in HER activity could be attributed to the flame-like morphology of Ni(OH)(2), which may strongly promote the dissociation of water and accelerate the formation of H-ad. This work also provides a new approach to designing efficient hybrid catalysts for the hydrogen evolution in alkaline media.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000432730900014

Different Ni thicknesses on Cu2O were achieved by varying the time of chronopotentiometric deposition of Ni. Electrochemical CO2 reduction was carried out at -0.89 V and -1.89 V vs. RHE, and it was found that formate and CO were the two major products. Cu2O modified with a Ni overlayer with a thickness of similar to 700 nm resulted in the highest formate faradaic efficiency of 18%, and Cu2O resulted in highest CO faradaic efficiency of 7.9%. The enhanced faradaic efficiency for formate is attributed to the synergistic effect between Ni and Cu2O due to maximized amounts of exposed bimetallic sites that facilitate CO2 reduction. The electrocatalyst also produces similar to 9 times more current density than previous studies using Ni-Cu2O electrocatalysts for the OER. The ability of the Ni-Cu2O thin films to catalyze both the OER and CO2 reduction allows them to be incorporated in the first demonstration of a two-electrode CO2 conversion device with a bifunctional catalyst. In this architecture, the device produces formate and CO with faradaic efficiencies of 16.0% and 19.7%, respectively.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000511170800015

Here, we present a bifunctional hybrid electrocatalyst consisting of Co9S8 (OER-active) and MoS2 (HER-active) with the structural merits of hierarchical morphology, huge electrochemically active sites, and greater charge transfer ability. The structural features of the hybrid electrocatalyst (Co9S8@MoS2/N-doped hollow carbon) that is derived from metal organic framework (MOF) precursor are elaborately controlled by the temperature dependent-Kirkendall diffusion effect. Specifically, the imbalanced diffusion rates between two ionic species (Co2+ and S2-), confined in the MOF-precursor geometry, induces the formation of internal voids and outward growth of Co9S8 while retaining MoS2 layers on the surface. As a result, the hybrid electrocatalyst exhibits greatly enhanced HER (126 mV@-10 mA cm(-2)) and OER (233 mV@10 mA cm(-2)) performance. Furthermore, the bifunctional electrode couple demonstrates efficient overall water splitting performance (1.56 V@10 mA cm(-2)) compared to the benchmark electrode couple of IrO2/C//Pt/C (1.63 V@10 mA cm(-2)) in 1 M KOH solution. The results highlight that inducing "Kirkendall effect" through temperature-tuning approach for structure-properties modulation can be extensively applied to design various bifunctional hybrid electrocatalysts.									30	0	0	0	2	0	29			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000637753500003

In this work, we report a facile synthesis of nitrogen doped carbon fibers derived from the carbonization of the electron-spun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) membrane at 800 degrees C (NCFs-800) as efficient and stable metal-free electrocatalyst for HER catalysis in both acidic and alkaline mediums. Ascribing to the homogenous nitrogen dopants in electrocatalyst, NCFs-800 requires only 114.3 mV and 198.6 mV vs. RHE to achieve current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH electrolytes, respectively. Moreover, the HER activity is well maintained after 2000 potential cycles indicating that NCFs-800 possesses high durability in both acidic and alkaline conditions due to the fibrous structure with high corrosion resistance. Our study offers new strategy to synthesize stable and efficient metal-free electrocatalyst, which could be extended to other heteroatom doped carbon electrocatalyst.

The composition of the nanocomposites was in the Pt:Ti range 1:10 to 1:80 atomic ratio. The composition effect on the hydrogen evolution reaction was investigated to get insights on both the activity of the platinum particles present in the composites as well as their spatial distribution. To this latter aim, a series of measurements was also carried out using the Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy (SECM) technique. The results obtained showed that even small amounts of platinum in the composites provide some activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction. It however proved the higher, the larger was the Pt content in the matrix. The Pt distribution in the various composites revealed anyway uniform across the surface, regardless of the Pt:Ti atomic ratios. The results obtained in solutions containing acids were compared with those obtained in Ru(NH3)(6)CI3.					4th Yugoslav-Materials-Research-Society Conference4th Yugoslav-Materials-Research-Society Conference	SEP 10-14, 2001SEP 10-14, 2001	Fed Republ Yugoslavia, Minist Dev, Sci & Environm; Republ Serbia, Minist Sci TechnolFed Republ Yugoslavia, Minist Dev, Sci & Environm; Republ Serbia, Minist Sci Technol	HERCEG NOVI, YUGOSLAVIAHERCEG NOVI, YUGOSLAVIA	7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0255-5476		0-87849-904-0	WOS:000180730700026

In a mildly acidic (pH 4.6) environment, the saturated surface hydride coverage of MoS2 was determined to be 31%, much higher than that expected for a crystalline nanoparticle. The HER rate constant of a surface molybdenum atom was measured for the first time in situ to be 3.8 s(-1) at a 600 mV overpotential. At high Mo-H coverages, a change in the nature of the active sites was observed upon consumption of Mo-H by HER.									31	1	0	0	2	0	31			1948-7185			WOS:000380415400018	27383727

XPS analysis was the primary tool adapted to characterize the surface changes in Pd catalysts arising from interactions with formic acid. Pd catalysts showed fast deactivation, though their activity could be simply recovered by applying a reduction potential at which hydrogen evolution reaction can occur. XPS analysis revealed that the surface of Pd catalysts is significantly affected by interaction with formic acid, thus confirming that the surface coverage of oxygen species plays an important role in formic acid electrooxidation on the Pd catalysts. At the same time, mass transfer of formic acid also has an effect on the deactivation of Pd catalysts.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000288447100086	21359275

Two cases are compared: Oxidation by RF oxygen plasma treatment and oxidation by anodic polarization in alkaline electrolyte. It is shown that the plasma treatment reduces the surface barrier to about 1.0 eV compared to 1.7 eV when subjected to anodic oxidation. For single-crystal line diamond, the oxygen evolution reaction in 0.1 M H2SO4 electrolyte is almost insensitive to the oxidation method while the plasma-treated nanocrystalline diamond electrode shows an enhanced activity of grain boundary defects at anodic potentials. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal that the plasma oxidation induces a higher content of carbonyl surface groups than anodic oxidation as well as a small amount of non-sp(3) contents.

Sealing effect of the glass-based top-coat and reactive elemental effect of Hf facilitated the formation of columnar alpha-Al2O3 at 1050 degrees C. Furthermore, a discontinuous gahnite interlayer formed at the alpha-Al2O3/top-coat interface due to interfacial reactions. However, because of the discontinuous microstructure of gahnite, the alpha-Al2O3 suffered durative attack by the active glass matrix, which caused severe internal oxidation of Hf and Al within the bond-coat. In addition, the oxygen barrier ability of the top-coat changed with its microstructure evolution.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000408731300015

The phase composition, crystal structure, morphology, textural properties, surface chemistry, optical properties and band structure were examined to comprehend the influence of Zn(2+)partial substitution with Fe(3+)on the catalytic activity of ZnO:Fe. Linear sweep voltammetry showed an improved catalytic activity of ZnO:5Fe toward the ORR, compared to pure ZnO, while with increased amounts of the Fe-dopant the activity decreased. The improvement was suggested by a more positive onset potential (0.394 Vvs.RHE), current density (0.231 mA cm(-2)at 0.150 Vvs.RHE), and faster kinetics (Tafel slope,b= 248 mV dec(-1)), and it may be due to the synergistic effect of (1) a sufficient amount of surface oxygen vacancies, and (2) a certain amount of plate-like particles composed of crystallites with well developed (0001) and (0001x304;) facets. Quite the contrary, the OER study showed that the introduction of Fe(3+)ions into the ZnO crystal structure resulted in enhanced catalytic activity of all ZnO:Fe samples, compared to pure ZnO, probably due to the modified binding energy and an optimized band structure. With the maximal current density of 1.066 mA cm(-2)at 2.216 Vvs.RHE, an onset potential of 1.856 Vvs.RHE, and the smallest potential difference between the OER and ORR (Delta E= 1.58 V), ZnO:10Fe may be considered a promising bifunctional catalyst toward the OER/ORR in moderately alkaline solution. This study demonstrates that the electrocatalytic activity of ZnO:Fe strongly depends on the defect chemistry and consequently the band structure. Along with providing fundamental insight into the electrocatalytic activity of ZnO:Fe, the study also indicates an optimal stoichiometry for enhanced bifunctional activity toward the OER/ORR, compared to pure ZnO.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000576194400046	32985642

It was shown that the heat production of Chlorella at low salt concentration (50 mM) increased and that it decreased at high concentration (500 mM). Chlorella was unable to adapt to concentrations of 1 M NaCl and above - in this sense, this degree of salinity was a critical value for the adaptive processes of this microalga. On the other hand, the halotolerant Dunaliella readily adapts to very high salinity. At 1.5 M salt concentration there was a considerable increase in heat production rate up to 200% compared with the 500 mM control. The light reactions of the microalgae in salinity were measured by a photo-microcalorimetric method. Dunaliella cells absorbed heat to a greater extent than Chlorella vulgaris cells which can be interpreted as more stored light energy in photosynthate.A polarographic method with a Clark-type electrode was employed in the dark to determine the respiration rate from the oxygen uptake rate; and photosynthesis was determined in the light from the oxygen evolution rate. At a salt concentration of 50 mM, there was some increase of the oxygen uptake rate by Chlorella cells and at high concentrations of salt in the medium from 500 mM to 1 M there was a sharp inhibition of this process. Dunaliella cells gave a different response to increasing salt concentrations in terms of the oxygen uptake rate. It considerably increased by 50-60% compared when the salt concentration in the medium was increased to 1.5 M. It is interesting to see that the rates of energy yielding processes in the Dunaliella control cells were significantly higher than those of Chlorella cells, presumably because of the increased rate of pumping out Na+ ions.The data support the hypothesis that an important feature of salt sensitive and salt tolerant microalgae is the increased energetic rate which ensures a quick and effective adaptation of them to stress.

The synthesized materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. And the electrochemical properties were obtained by linear sweep voltammetry, chronoamperometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. For the first method, the obtained catalyst with loading 20% Fe3O4 on CoSe2 (C20a) exhibits the highest oxygen reduction reaction activity. While for the second method, the obtained catalyst with loading 30% Fe3O4 on CoSe2 (C30b) exhibits the highest oxygen reduction reaction activity, with an onset potential of 0.775 V, a half-wave potential of 0.600 V, and Tafel slope of 65 mV decade(-1) in O-2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4. Which are better than those of C20a (0.753, 0.567 V and 67 mV decade(-1)), CoSe2 (0.708, 0.560 V and 66 mV decade(-1)) and Fe3O4 (0.700, 0.556 V and 79 mV decade(-1)). More importantly, C30b shows much higher stability and better methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol tolerance than other prepared materials.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000414079300022

According to the characterization of scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope, CuO NPs are uniformly distributed on the wrinkled G sheets.

While platinum group materials have shown high activities for ORR, their practical uses are hampered by concerns over deactivation, slow kinetics, exorbitant cost, and scarce nature reserve. The low cost yet high tunability of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) provide a unique platform for tailoring their characteristic properties as new electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a new concept of design and present stable Zr-chain-based MOFs as efficient electrocatalysts for ORR. The strategy is based on using Zr-chains to promote high chemical and redox stability and, more importantly, tailor the immobilization and packing of redox active-sites at a density that is ideal to improve the reaction kinetics. The obtained new electrocatalyst, PCN-226, thereby shows high ORR activity. We further demonstrate PCN-226 as a promising electrode material for practical applications in rechargeable Zn-air batteries, with a high peak power density of 133 mW cm(-2). Being one of the very few electrocatalytic MOFs for ORR, this work provides a new concept by designing chain-based structures to enrich the diversity of efficient electrocatalysts and MOFs.									71	5	0	0	3	0	70			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000571437600022	32786758

The cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is an important catalytic system, mainly finding practice in fuel cell and metal-air battery technologies. This work presents the synthesis, structural characterization and electrocatalytic properties of three different Cu2Mo6S8 structures as alternative ORR electrocatalysts. The effect of different carbon additives during synthesis was studied and no positive influence of the carbon addition was indicated. Our findings show that only the bare Cu2Mo6S8 enhances the ORR electro-performance to class with the state-of-the-art ORR catalysts. Excellent stability of 10,000 consecutive ORR cycles, a superior onset potential of 0.894 V and halfwave (E-1/2) potential of 0.641 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) increase the noteworthiness of the Cu2Mo6S8 electrodes. Aside from experimental investigations, density functional theory calculations deliver profound knowledge on the structural and electronic properties (electronic band structure, partial density of states and electron density) of Cu2Mo6S8.

Heteroatom doped carbon materials have been considered as one of most promising alternatives to Pt-based catalysts. In this work, we exploit a nitrogen and sulfur dual-doped one-dimensional carbon rod catalyst with porous graphene-like layers on the surface derived from a Ni based metal-organic framework (MOF). The Ni-NSPC-6 catalyst with uniform distribution of N and S atoms in the carbon skeleton possesses a porous structure and a considerable specific surface area. Benefited from the special one-dimensional morphology, the convenient channel provided by the porous structure, the synergistic effect from the homogeneous co-doping of N and S, and the existence of proper amount of Ni3S2, the Ni-NSPC-6 affords a remarkable electrocatalytic performance toward ORR, including positive onset and half-wave potentials, a high catalytic current density, a low Tafel slope for oxygen reduction reaction and a remarkable ORR durability. The controllable synthesis of MOF derived S, N co-doped carbon materials with porous nanostructure will offer prospects in developing high performance electrocatalysts.									15	3	0	0	0	0	15			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000469901300021

The electrocatalysts were prepared by simple pyrolysis by varying the pyrolysis temperature and metal phthalocyanine-to-MWCNT ratio. The surface morphology of the catalyst materials was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and surface composition by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The rotating disk electrode (RDE) method was used to determine the electrocatalytic activity of these materials in 0.1 M KOH solution. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities achieved are comparable to well-studied Fe and Co phthalocyanine based catalysts in alkaline media, showing the great potential of non-redox-active metal phthalocyanine-derived catalysts as cathode materials for metal-air batteries and fuel cells. The number of electrons transferred per O-2 molecule was determined by the Koutecky-Levich analysis, which indicated that at high negative potentials the ORR process followed a four-electron pathway. The O-2 reduction results obtained in this study show clearly the important role of non-redox-active metal ion in the formation of active sites for ORR on pyrolyzed and carbon supported Li and Zn metallomacrocyclic compounds.

It is well-known that the water-splitting voltage is limited by a theoretical potential of 1.23 V of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Recently, a new electrolytic method using the iodide oxidation reaction (IOR) instead of the OER has been proposed to produce the valuable chemicals iodine and hydrogen efficiently with a reduced operating voltage. In this work, we found that the graphite-based materials with a delocalized pi electron system exhibited fast charge transfer with physically adsorbed iodide ions, thus revealing desirable IOR catalytic activity. The carbon fiber paper with a graphite structure was chosen as the catalyst and exhibited an onset potential of 0.54 V (vs. RHE) for the IOR, which is close to the standard potential of iodide oxidation. Also, the CFP demonstrated a minimum Tafel slope of 47.78 mV dec(-1) in the electrochemical reaction with significant stability at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for over 18 hours. Moreover, in a two-electrode system, a cell voltage of only 0.59 V was required to provide a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the IOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In terms of energy costs, our HER and IOR system can reduce energy consumption by 65% compared to conventional OER-based water electrolysis. The overall results indicate that our findings provide a new route to facilitate the industrial application of hydrogen production via electrochemical reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000869875800001

We review the use of protective thin films to improve the electrochemical stability of otherwise unstable semiconductor photoelectrodes (e.g., Si and GaAs). We first discuss the origins of instability and various strategies for achieving stable and functional photoelectrosynthetic interfaces. We then focus specifically on the use of thin protective films on photoanodes and photocathodes for photosynthetic reactions that include oxygen evolution, halide oxidation, and hydrogen evolution. Finally, we provide an outlook for the future development of thin-layer protection strategies to enable semiconductor-based solar-driven fuel production.									198	4	0	0	8	0	199			1932-7447			WOS:000363994500001

Since the realistic support with various topologies or defects offers diverse coordination environments, realizing real homogeneity requires precise control over the anchoring sites. In this work, we selectively anchor Ir single atoms onto the three-fold hollow sites (Ir-1/T-O-CoOOH) and oxygen vacancies (Ir-1/V-O-CoOOH) on defective CoOOH surface to investigate how the anchoring sites modulate catalytic performance. The oxygen evolution activities of Ir-1/T-O-CoOOH and Ir-1/V-O-CoOOH are improved relative to CoOOH through different mechanisms. For Ir-1/T-O-CoOOH, the strong electronic interaction between single-atom Ir and the support modifies the electronic structure of the active center for stronger electronic affinity to intermediates. For Ir-1/V-O-CoOOH, a hydrogen bonding is formed between the coordinated oxygen of single-atom Ir center and the oxygenated intermediates, which stabilizes the intermediates and lowers the energy barrier of the rate-determining step.While single-atom catalysts offer well-defined structures, the homogeneity of the active sites is determined by localized coordination environments. Here, authors anchor Ir single atoms onto different sites on CoOOH and show how their distinct coordinations activate oxygen-evolving electrocatalysis									6	0	0	0	0	0	6				2041-1723		WOS:000791508600009	35513390

In this paper, a proof-of-concept study based on a series of hybrids of nickel iron (hydr)oxide nanoparticles (NiFeO NPs) and carbon supports with different oxidation level compared the motivation of supports for OER activity. The key to implementation lay in anchoring and growing of NiFeO NPs on the various carbon supports by electrostatic assembly and subsequent in-situ reduction. A series of experiments indicated that the strong coupling of metal ions and graphene oxide (GO) contributed to the formation of ultrasmall NiFeO NPs (approximate to 2 nm) and the firm interaction between NiFeO NPs and GO, which in turn resulted in exposing more metal atoms, modulating local electron structure of active sites, and accelerating the charge-transfer ability. The OER activity of optimal NiFeO NPs anchored on rGO (NiFeO NPs/rGO) was significantly elevated, achieving an overpotential as small as 201 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 68 mV dec(-1), as well as remarkable stability. Such exciting capacity for catalyzing OER prevailed over the vast majority of previously reported transition-metal electrocatalysts, even superior to numerous noble metal-containing catalysts. The electrolyzer employing NiFeO NPs/rGO and commercial Pt/C for anode and cathode could be powered by a solar cell for efficient alkaline seawater splitting. This work opens up a universal and scalable way for further advancing the intrinsic activity of energy-related materials.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000714532800001	34652074

In this work, layered crystalline and amorphous platinum disulfide (PtS2) were synthesized, characterised and their fundamental electrochemical properties were investigated. Both materials exhibited inherent oxidation and reduction reactions which would limit their operating potential window for sensing applications. Amorphous phase materials are considered to be promising electrocatalysts due to the porous, and nanostructured morphology with high concentration of unsaturated active sites. The electrocatalytic performances towards oxygen reduction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) of crystalline and amorphous PtS2 were analysed. Amorphous PtS2 was found to exhibit superior electrocatalytic performances towards ORR and HER as compared to crystalline PtS2. For HER, amorphous and crystalline PtS2 have overpotential values of 0.30 V and 0.70 V (vs. RHE) at current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. The influence of electrochemical reduction pre-treatment on their catalytic behaviours was also investigated. Electrochemical reduction pre-treatment on both crystalline and amorphous PtS2 removed the oxidized sulfate groups and increased the proportion of Pt-0 oxidation state which exposed more catalytic sites. As such, these materials were activated and displayed improved ORR and HER performances. Electrochemically reduced amorphous PtS2 outperformed the untreated counterparts and exhibited the best HER performance with overpotential of 0.17 V (vs. RHE) at current density of -10 mA cm(-2). These findings provide insights into the electrochemical properties of noble metal PtS2 in both crystalline and amorphous states which can be activated by electrochemical reduction pre-treatment.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000469274700015	31063216

Although extensive research has been conducted in recent decades, issues such as low specific capacity, high discharge/charge overpotential, and poor cycle life remain the challenges for their real commercialization. These critical issues point to the cathode, the location of the electrochemical reaction. During discharge, insoluble insulating discharge products (Li2O_2) are deposited on the surface of the cathode, obstructing the diffusion channels of oxygen and electrolyte and covering the catalytic active sites, resulting in the battery's discharge being prematurely terminated. In the charging process, the high charging potential causes the decomposition of carbon materials, electrolytes, and binders, further resulting in the formation of by-products and the rapid decline of battery cycle life. Therefore, the design and investigation of the cathode catalysts with dense pore structure, high conductivity, and high catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reactions (ORR/OER), as well as acceptable chemical/electrochemical stability, remain challenging. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivatives are a class of candidate catalysts in Li-O_2 batteries due to their flexible chemical composition, high specific surface area, and tailorable pore structure. The strategies discussed in this review include the use of MOF-derived carbon-based materials, MOF-derived single-atom catalysts, and pristine MOFs, which were successfully applied as high-performance cathode catalysts for Li-O_2 batteries. Additionally, suggestions are offered for improving the ORR/OER catalytic activity by optimizing the properties of MOFs and their derivatives. Finally, the future research direction of MOFs as cathode catalysts for nonaqueous Li-O_2 batteries is discussed.			金属有机骨架材料(MOFs)及其衍生物因其灵活多变的化学组成和多孔结构等独特优点而成为锂-氧气(Li-O_2)电池正极的候选催化剂。本文通过对近期相关文献的分析,综述了MOFs基催化剂的设计和合成策略,重点介绍了MOFs热解衍生碳基材料、MOFs衍生单原子催化剂以及原始MOFs材料在Li-O_2电池中的应用,分析了MOFs及其衍生物对ORR/OER的催化机理。综合分析表明,构建具有高密度催化活性位点、结构稳定、孔隙率高、导电性良好的MOFs材料及其衍生物是今后开发高效Li-O_2电池正极催化剂的发展方向。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-4239			CSCD:7143499

Co-based electrocatalysts have been regarded as a class of highly active and earth-abundant catalysts for the OER, but most of them are semiconductors or insulators that may limit the OER efficiency. Herein, we report the facile preparation of CoxFeyN nanoparticles uniformly loaded on graphene sheets (CoxFeyN/graphene) with amazing OER activity and stability, attributed to the intrinsic metallic characteristics. Through partial Fe heteroatom substitution in Co4N lattices, the disorder of the crystalline structure could be increased, thus forming a more favorable electronic structure for the catalysis of the OER. By adjusting the atomic ratios of Co/Fe elements, we found that the Co3Fe1N/graphene catalyst exhibited the highest activity for the OER under alkaline conditions among the CoxFeyN/graphene samples, showing the lowest overpotential of 266 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), the highest current density of 105.83 mA cm(-2) at 1.53 V, and the lowest Tafel slope of 32 mV dec(-1). Moreover, the freestanding electrodes of CoxFeyN/graphene catalysts loaded on carbon paper (CP) also exhibited excellent long-term stability for the OER, and the overpotentials only slightly increased after continuously testing for 16 h at 10 mA cm(-2). Among all the CoxFeyN/graphene/CP samples, the Co3Fe1N/graphene/CP sample also displayed the best long-term stability and the lowest overpotential (270 mV) after 16 h. This work presents the great potential of CoxFeyN/graphene catalysts as promising non-noble metal electrocatalysts for the OER for application in clean energy conversion devices.									33	4	0	0	0	0	33			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472219400009

Previous surveys studied this mechanism only for solar composition matter accreted on top of carbon oxygen (CO) white dwarfs. Since, during the runaway, mixing with carbon enhances the hydrogen burning rates dramatically, one should question whether significant enrichment of the ejecta is possible also for other underlying compositions (He, O, Ne, Mg) predicted by stellar evolution models. When needed we upgraded our reaction network and simulated several non-carbon cases. Despite large differences in rates, time scales and energetics, our results show that the convective dredge up mechanism predicts significant enrichment in all cases, including that of helium enrichment in recurrent novae.					4th International Conference on Classical and Recurrent Novae - Stella Novae: Past and Future Decades4th International Conference on Classical and Recurrent Novae - Stella Novae: Past and Future Decades	FEB 04-08, 2013FEB 04-08, 2013	Univ Cape Town; Natl Res Fdn; S African Astron Observ; Univ Cape Town, Astrophys Cosmol & Grav Ctr; Royal Astron Soc; Square Kilometre Array S Africa Project OffUniv Cape Town; Natl Res Fdn; S African Astron Observ; Univ Cape Town, Astrophys Cosmol & Grav Ctr; Royal Astron Soc; Square Kilometre Array S Africa Project Off	Pavilion Clock Tower, Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICAPavilion Clock Tower, Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICA	1	0	0	0	0	0	1					978-1-58381-864-0	WOS:000368750100040

However, their performance as oxygen-generating anodes in photoelectrochemical cells has not been studied in detail. In this work, ultra-fine particles of amorphous MnO2, crystalline MnO2 nanorods, Ca2Mn3O8, CaMn2O4 and CaMnO3 were synthesised using a green and scalable mechanochemical method. The particles were comparatively studied as water oxidation photocatalysts in a photo-electrochemical cell at near-neutral pH. The oxides were immobilized on the anode surface using an organic, conducting polymer that facilitated electron exchange and catalytic turnover in a manner similar to redox-active tyrosine in the OEC. The differences in their photocatalytic performances were evaluated in terms of: (1) structural similarities to the natural OEC, (2) Mn oxidation state, (3) crystal structure, (4) specific surface area, (5) electron energy state, and (6) the presence/absence of Ca. The results confirmed the importance of having a local structure that is as similar as possible to the natural OEC cluster, including the presence of Ca. However, it also indicated that it is simplistic to focus only on this feature. The other factors listed above may also play a critical role in performance. Future design of biomimetic catalysts for solar fuel production needs to consider and concurrently optimize all of the relevant influences.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000524587800015

Atomic layer thin films of biphasic spinels Co3O4 and CoO were fabricated through pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and examined for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). During this process, the biphasic thin film interface of cobalt oxides underwent significant activation after prolonged potentiostatic electrolysis at 1.59 V vs. RHE with pronounced enhancement in its OER activity. The biphasic thin film interface of cobalt oxides required 372-5 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2) which was reduced by 55 mV after activation. The associated lower Tafel slope (55 mV dec(-1)) implies better kinetics on the activated thin film interface of cobalt oxides. This indicated that the thin film of cobalt oxides must have undergone significant surface reconstruction at the interface. To find out the same, a set of detailed pre-and post-activation material characterization studies were carried out where the results have evidenced that there had been a dominant formation of beta-CoOOH along with some Co(OH)(2) and KCoO2 as a result of the phenomenon of electrochemical phase (ECP) formation under potentiostatic/galvanostatic activation conditions. A comparative study under identical conditions with the state-ofthe- art OER electrocatalyst RuO2 had revealed that the biphasic thin film interface of cobalt oxides had nearly parallel activity before activation and better activity after the construction of beta-CoOOH along with some Co(OH)(2) and KCoO2 via potentiostatic surface reconstruction of the catalytic interface.									36	0	0	0	0	0	36			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000415070100021

Although considerable OER catalytic performances achieved under high overpotential, the catalytic talent of NiFe-LDH electrocatalysts at low overpotential is rarely realized due to the absence of high-valence Ni and Fe sites. We herein report a surface engineering route to fabricate sulfated NiFe-LDH nanosheets via ion exchange strategy in sulfate-rich media. XPS results reveal a modified surface electronic structure with high-valence Ni and Fe after ion exchange reaction. Computational PDOS results suggest that computed d-band centers (epsilon(d)) of Fe and Ni for sulfated NiFe-LDH show a significant downward shift resulting an increased valence of metal cation with orbital volume shrinkage. The high-valence Fe can facilitate a optimized multi-electron process of Ni center from [Ni-II-OH] /[Ni-III-OH] to Ni-IV-OOH rather than Ni-II/Ni-III to Ni-IV at low overpotential. The high-valence Ni can serve as the highly active center for O-O coupling during OER process. Combined with the synergetic action of high-valence Fe and Ni, the sulfated NiFe-LDH nanosheets exhibit much larger reaction kinetics and outstanding electrocatalytic activity on glassy carbon electrode (eta(10) = 219 mV, eta(50) = 288 mV) with a remarkable long-term stability.									28	0	0	0	4	0	28			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000730502900004

The mesoporosity is constantly present, independent of the composition or microstructure, homogeneously distributed in all dimensions of the films with a pore diameter in the order of 10 nm. Film thickness is uniform and in the range of 200-300 nm. The films show improved performance over an electrodeposited Pt film at hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and excellent stability in H2SO4 during 200 cycles. For the composition 84 at% Ni and 16 at% Pt, the overpotential required to reach a HER activity of -10 mA/cm(2) is as low as - 0.09 V vs. RHE. Meanwhile, the mesoporous alloy film with 95 at% Ni exhibits the highest activity with regard to the electrochemical surface area (ECSA).									41	0	0	0	0	0	41			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000514218900047

The ultrathin nature of the MOF nanosheets gave rise to the modification of structure at the electronic level with abundant Se-vacancies and effective electronic coupling via an Ni-N-x coordination at the interface between the Ni0.85Se@NC core and NC shell. The Ni0.85Se@NC obtained exhibited low overpotentials for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER; 300 mV) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER; 157 mV) at 10 mA.cm(-2) under an alkaline condition, outperforming their corresponding bulk MOF-derived counterparts. By exploiting Ni0.85Se@NC as anode and cathode catalysts, a low cell voltage of 1.61 V was achieved by performing alkaline water electrolysis. Remarkably, it also reached a high activity in natural seawater (pH = 7.98) and simulated seawater (pH = 7.86) electrolytes, even surpassing integrated Pt/C-RuO2/CC electrodes. Density functional theory (DFT) studies illustrated that abundant Se-vacancies effectively regulated the electronic structure of Ni0.85Se@NC by accelerating electron transfer from Ni to N atoms at the interface, and thus, enabling the Ni0.85Se@NC to attain a near-optimal electronic configuration that stimulated ideal adsorption-free energy toward key reaction intermediates.[GRAPHICS].									15	2	0	0	0	0	15				2096-5745		WOS:000794242400018

Herein, a scalable and facile self-catalyzed growth strategy is developed to integrate highly active Co-N-C sites with 3D brush-like nanostructure, achieving Co-N-C nanobrushes with Co,N-codoped carbon nanotube branches grown on Co,N-codoped nanoparticle assembled nanowire backbones. Systematic investigations suggest that nanobrushes deliver significantly improved electrocatalytic activity compared with nanowire or nanotube counterparts and the longer nanotube branches give the better performance. Benefiting from the increase of accessible highly active sites and enhanced mass transfer and electron transportation, the present Co-N-C nanobrush exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity and durability when used as a bifunctional oxygen catalyst. It enables a rechargeable Zn-air battery with a high peak power density of 246 mW cm(-2) and excellent cycling stability. These results suggest that the reported synthetic strategy may open up possibilities for exploring efficient electrocatalysts for diverse applications.									55	5	0	0	2	0	55			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000527951700001	32329197

A modelling approach for the heterogeneous oxidation of elastomers								CONTINUUM MECHANICS AND THERMODYNAMICS				29	5	SI		1149	1161		10.1007/s00161-017-0568-8				SEP 2017	2017	The influence of oxygen on elastomers, known as oxidation, is one of the most important ageing processes and becomes more and more important for nowadays applications. The interaction with thermal effects as well as antioxidants makes oxidation of polymers a complex process. Based on the polymer chosen and environmental conditions, the ageing processes may behave completely different. In a lot of cases the influence of oxygen is limited to the surface layer of the samples, commonly referred to as diffusion-limited oxidation. For the lifetime prediction of elastomer components, it is essential to have detailed knowledge about the absorption and diffusion behaviour of oxygenmolecules during thermo-oxidative ageing and how they react with the elastomer. Experimental investigations on industrially used elastomeric materials are executed in order to develop and fit models, which shall be capable of predicting the permeation and consumption of oxygen as well as changes in the mechanical properties. The latter are of prime importance for technical applications of rubber components. Oxidation does not occur homogeneously over the entire elastomeric component. Hence, material models which include ageing effects have to be amplified in order to consider heterogeneous ageing, which highly depends on the ageing temperature. The influence of elevated temperatures upon accelerated ageing has to be critically analysed, and influences on the permeation and diffusion coefficient have to be taken into account. This work presents phenomenological models which describe the oxygen uptake and the diffusion into elastomers based on an improved understanding of ongoing chemical processes and diffusion limiting modifications. On the one side, oxygen uptake is modelled by means of Henry's law in which solubility is a function of the temperature as well as the ageing progress. The latter is an irreversible process and described by an inner differential evolution equation. On the other side, further diffusion of oxygen into the material is described by a model based on Fick's law, which is modified by a reaction term. The evolved diffusion-reaction equation depends on the ageing temperature as well as on the progress of ageing and is able to describe diffusion-limited oxidation.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0935-1175	1432-0959		WOS:000408062000008

Nevertheless, developing noble-metal-free photocatalysts for efficient solar-to-fuel conversion still remains challenging now. Herein, size-uniform nanoassemblies constructed by ultra-small Zn, Ni-doped CdS nanocrystals and 1T/2H (similar to 67% 1T phase) oxygen-incorporated MoS2 (O-MoS2) nanosheets were obtained through an ultrasonic water-bath strategy combined with an electrostatic assembly process, which are highly active for visible-light photocatalytic H-2 evolution reaction (HER), displaying a superior H-2 formation rate of 112.78 mmo.g(-1).h(-1) (21 times that of Pt-CdS) and the corresponding apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 72.0% at 420 nm. The outstanding HER performance originates from the following aspects: First, the interfacial charge transfer and separation between CdS and O-MoS2 are dramatically boosted by the enlarged electron-transfer driving force and the prolonged carrier lifetime via Zn, Ni-doping. Besides, the defect-rich O-MoS2 nanosheets with 1T/2H mixed phases are provided with abundant active sites for H-2 production. Moreover, the oxygen incorporation in MoS2 enhances the conductivity and lowers the energy barrier of H-2 evolution. The results indicated in this work could offer new ideas for designing novel nanostructures to promote the conversion and utilization of solar energy.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			1528-7483	1528-7505		WOS:000647362200054

The liberated OEC33 and also OEC24 to a lesser extent were subsequently damaged and then exhibited smeared bands in SDS/urea-PAGE. Once deteriorated, OEC33 could not bind to PSII. The effects of scavengers and chelating reagents on the damage indicated that hydroxyl radicals generated from superoxide in the presence of metal ions were responsible for the damage. These results suggest that, like the D1 protein of the PSII reaction center complex, OEC subunits suffer oxidative damage and turnover under illumination.									69	22	1	0	61	0	91			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:000189238700015	14988496

The open pores in the porous Mo2C nanoparticle clusters can facilitate electrolyte permeation and hydrogen molecules release as well as the carbon matrix can enhance the conductivity. As a result, the optimal Mo2C exhibits an efficient HER performance, with an overpotential of 140 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 63 mV dec(-1) as well as excellent electrochemical stability. The strategy changing waste walnut shell into the effective catalysts sets an example for the searching and designing rational energy materials. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Experiments are performed in batch and dual cell quasi-steady operation with different light intensities and zinc sulfide photo-catalyst concentrations. The photo-reactor in batch operation achieves 6 mL h(-1) of hydrogen production with 3% w/v of catalyst. The hydrogen production rate corresponds to a quantum efficiency of 75% as measured through illumination of zinc sulfide suspensions in a dual cell reactor.

Incorporation of hydrogen and oxygen into (t)a-C:H thin films deposited using DECR plasma(*)								Nanotubes, Fullerenes, Nanostructured and Disordered Carbon. Symposium (Materials Research Society Symposium Proceedings Vol.675)								W10.3.1	6						2001	2001	A distributed electron cyclotron resonance (DECR) plasma reactor powered by a microwave generator operating at 2.45 GHz (800 W) was used to deposit (t)a-C:H thin films at RT on <100> Si substrates RF biased within the range 25les|V0|les600 V. C2H2 was used as precursor. The plasma pressure was varied within the range 0.1lesPles1.5 mtorr. The films were analysed using spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The hydrogen content NH and the density of the films were determined from nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) using the resonance at 6.385 MeV of the reaction: 15N+1Hrarr12C+4He+gamma. Positron spectroscopy was used to detect the porosity. The evolutions of NH as a function of the substrate ion current density n+ and as a function of V0 show that the hydrogen incorporation results from the competition between chemisorption and deposited energy density related effects. The increase of the hydrogen incorporation leads to a decrease in the film density and a lower deposition rate. The porosity of the films deposited at low pressure (~0.1 mtorr) with V0=-80 V has been detected. The comparison between results of SRIM-2000 simulations and the evolution of NH as a function of V0 shows that the porosity and the hydrogen content are not correlated. The absorption of oxygen and nitrogen for the low density films has been detected from the observation of the 3250-4000 cm-1 infrared (IR) band.

We have studied the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance of these catalysts as they evolve from their most crude and inactive form to their most active form. Electrochemical half-cell and fuel cell tests suggest that the presence of Fe was crucial in these samples. The high-temperature heat treatment (once in argon and then in ammonia) at temperatures aeyen950 A degrees C were also critical in imparting these catalysts with their highest activity; however, significant loss of activity was observed with cycling and potential hold at 0.5 V for 100 h. In addition, acid-washing after the first or the second pyrolysis steps produced a marked decrease in ORR activity relative to their unwashed counterparts. We also report findings from our efforts towards benchmarking FeNC catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalysis. Specifically, we focus on correlating the specific kinetic current (i(K)) at 0.75 V to electrochemically accessible surface area (EASA) and roughness factor (RF) determined from electrochemical double layer capacitance measurements. Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy was employed to shed light into the nature of active sites in FeNC catalysts and provide insights into their deactivation behavior caused by acid-washing. The results suggest planar FeN4 doublet (Fe2+, low spin) as an active site in these materials, which may be leached away in acid, explaining their decreased activity after acid washing. Results for characterization experiments using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature programmed oxidation and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry are also presented.									31	4	0	0	1	0	31			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000382011600013

This, however, remains a great challenge. In this context, we fabricated a novel three-dimensional (3D) network comprising N-doped carbon-coated core-shell NiFeOx@ NiFe-P (denoted as NC-NiFeOx@ NiFe-P) by two-pot high-temperature phosphorization and surface oxidation of a NiFe-Prussian blue analogue/ polyvinylpyrrolidone (denoted as NiFe-PBAs/PVP) hybrid precursor. The as-synthesized NCNiFeOx@ NiFe-P catalyst demonstrated exceptional performance for both OER and HER, offering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (a metric related to solar fuel) at small overpotentials of 285 mV for the OER and 237 mV for the HER in 1 M KOH, respectively. As expected, a NC-NiFeOx@ NiFe-P based alkaline electrolyzer with durability of 20 h was manufactured to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.59 V, outperforming most non-precious metal-based electrolyzers. The exceptional performance could be attributed to the unique 3D network composed of core-shell NiFeOx@ NiFe-P and highly conductive N-doped carbon (NC), which provided a large amount of highly active sites for both OER and HER and favored fast electron transport during electrocatalytic processes.									33	0	0	0	1	0	33			2398-4902			WOS:000431422700017

Although Pt is considered to be the most active catalyst for the HER, its reaction performance is limited in alkaline solutions owing to a slow rate for water dissociation. Therefore, many research groups have intensively investigated reaction mechanisms and developed system designs and efficient Pt-based catalysts to enhance the alkaline HER. Herein, we summarize the catalytic surface specificity of Pt and Pt-Ni(OH)(2) materials to control the kinetics of the alkaline HER. In particular, we increase our understanding of Ni(OH)(2)-modified Pt surfaces and the corresponding nanoscaled Pt-Ni(OH)(2) electrocatalysts to improve the sluggish water-dissociation step, and this knowledge will guide us to future sustainable energy applications of advanced nanomaterials.									61	3	0	0	2	0	61			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000442491300001	29943506

The results are discussed in terms of atomic transport mechanisms and modification of interfacial microstructure, Atomic transport is studied through the use of isotopic tracing and nuclear reactions analyses (NRA): we measured the atomic areal densities ((14)N,(15)N,(16)O,(18)O) in the films and the concentration depth profiles of the heavy and stable isotopes ((15)N, (18)O) with near surface subnanometric resolution. To scan the evolution of the interfacial microstructure, Pb(0) centers concentrations were measured by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR), after each treatment step. The previously proposed mechanisms for NO oxynitridation of silica are confirmed: i) the NO molecules diffuse via interstitial sites, without reaction with the lattice, before reacting with the dielectric/Si interface; ii) at the external surface region, oxygen exchange is observed due to a step-by-step motion of network oxygen atoms induced by the presence of network defects. During reoxidation in O(2) neither loss or observable redistribution of nitrogen is evidenced. For the 13-nm thick film, in the external surface region, the oxygen exchange is seen to be more effective than in the case of silica (or silicon) oxidation: that is O(2) is more reactive on NO-nitrided silica than on pure silica. The concentration of Pb(0) centers decreases after the NO thermal step and increases again after the further reoxidation step.

Experiments were performed in a laminar flow reactor providing an oxygen-enriched exhaust gas environment at elevated temperatures. Single coal particles in a sieve fraction of 90-125 A mu m and a significant amount of volatiles (36 wt%) were injected along the burner's centerline. Coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy measurements were taken to characterize the gas-phase temperature. Time-resolved imaging of the OH distribution at 10 kHz allowed identifying reaction and post-flame zones and gave access to the temporal evolution of burning coal particles. During volatile combustion, a symmetric diffusion flame was observed around the particle starting from a distance of similar to 150 A mu m from the particle surface.

The film's photocatalytic activity and ability to evolve oxygen in a sacrificial solution were assessed. It was found that photocatalytic activity increased with film thickness (from 50 to 500 nm thick samples) for the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue in solution and resazurin redox dye in an intelligent ink dye deposited on the surface. Contrastingly, an optimum film thickness of similar to 200 nm for both composite and pure films of titanium dioxide was found for water oxidation, using persulfate (S2O82-) as a sacrificial electron acceptor. The nanoparticle composite films showed significantly higher activity in oxygen evolution studies compared with plain TiO2 films.									22	1	0	0	4	0	22			0959-9428	1364-5501		WOS:000289899300015

For this purpose, bimetallic nanoparticles were synthesized keeping similar crystallite sizes (similar to 6 nm), particle sizes (similar to 6 nm), mass compositions (18 +/- 4% co-metal) and metallic loadings (18.3 +/- 5.1%). PdAu/C, PdPt/C and the most active PdFe2O3/C material (75% of O-v) displayed an improved onset potential (Eons) during the oxidation of 1.5 M ethanol in 0.3 M KOH in comparison with a monometallic Pd/C material, finding the trend: PdAu/C (-0.56 V us. NHE) > PdPt/C (-0.55 V) > PdFe2O3/C (-0.51 V) > Pd/C (-0.50 V). In addition, these bimetallic materials presented an increase in the current density; being PdPt/C and PdFe2O3/C the most active materials for EOR. A spectroelectrochemical analysis was performed by coupling a mu Raman spectroscope with an electrochemical cell. This analysis allowed to conclude that the improvement of the E-onset is related to changes in chemisorption en-ergies as was suggested by Raman shifts found for the C-1-M (metal) bond, while the high activity of PdPt/C can be attributed to a higher adsorption of ethanol molecules. Addi-tionally, it was found that the activity of PdFe2O3/C is associated with an energy decrease to form the C-1-M bond, which could be promoted by the abundance of oxygen vacancies.

We herein designed a calix[4]resorcinarene-based metal-organic supramolecular system with rich hydrogen bonds, namely [Cu2L(H2O)(2)]center dot 3DMF (L = calix[4]resorcinarene-based ligand and DMF = N,N'-dimethylformamide) or Cu2L. Then, the hydrogen bonded metal-organic supramolecular system was applied as a cocatalyst in BiVO4 nanoplate photoanode for water oxidation reaction. Photoelectrochemical and electrochemical analysis demonstrated that the obtained Cu2L-modified BiVO4 photoanode showed greatly enhanced water oxidation efficiency, which was about three times higher than bare BiVO4 nanoplates. In addition, photoelectrochemical activity was well maintained within three hours. Cu2L as an efficient cocatalyst can promote the holes on the surface of the photoanode to participate in the oxygen evolution reaction, thus improving the performance of the photoanode. This work presents a feasible strategy by using the hydrogen bonded metal-organic supramolecular system to functionalize photoanodes for enhanced water oxidation efficiency.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000672570500004

With the well-developed ZnWO4 nanorod powder (aspect ratio similar to 7-20) as a representative, the effects of subsequent calcination (700 degrees C, in air and oxygen) on photo luminescent and photocatalytic performances were comparatively analyzed. Detailed characterization of the products was conducted by XRD, FE-SEM, HR-TEM, and FT-IR, Raman, fluorescence and UV-Vis spectroscopies. It was shown that the as-synthesized and calcined ZnWO4 crystallites all exhibited broad excitation (similar to 225-325 nm, peaked at similar to 283 nm; lambda(em) = 482 nm) and emission (similar to 400-700 nm, maxima at similar to 482 nm; lambda(ex) = 283 nm) that arise from the (1)A(1g) -> T-1(1u) and T-3(1u) -> (1)A(1g) electronic transitions within the WO6 ligand, respectively. Calcination in air and oxygen improved the integrated emission intensity by similar to 1.54 and 1.65 times, respectively. The calcination, however, significantly deteriorated the photocatalytic capability of ZnWO4 toward the degradation of methyl orange (MO) under UV irradiation. It was shown that similar to 93% of the MO molecules were degraded by the as-synthesized ZnWO4 nanorods with 80 min of UV radiation, while the values are only similar to 39.1 and 44.4% for the powders calcined in air and oxygen, respectively. The above results were interpreted by considering interaction of the excited electrons with oxygen vacancy defects, electron-hole interaction and UV absorbance of the ZnWO4 products.									31	0	0	0	3	1	32			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000465058500133

To make clear the real highly-active centers in the heterostructured material and obtain direct evidence to further understand the origin of the enhanced ORR/OER kinetics accurately, here we prepared a surface-patterned heterostructured thin-film of typical Ln(1-x)Sr(x)CoO(3)/Ln(2-x)Sr(x)CoO(4) (Ln is lanthanide) using designed pulsed laser deposition (PLD), exposed the local heterointerface and visualized its enhanced performance using three-dimensional time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (3D TOF-SIMS) after O-18(2)/O-16(2) isotope exchange. Additionally, a multiple-layered heterostructured thin-film was constructed by PLD with switched targets, and the atomic-resolution crystal structures of local heterointerface were observed via scanning transmission electron microscopy after focused ion beam milling. Moreover, the origin of ORR/OER enhancement at local heterointerface was further studied directly, the results demonstrate that ORR/OER process is accelerated due to the decrease of Co valance state and generated oxygen vacancies. This study gives an effective strategy to precisely investigate the heterostructured materials for energy storage technologies such as batteries and fuel cells.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000595105100005

The PCMs possess fascinating properties, including unique porosity, low cost, higher conductivity, fast mass transport for easy access of analytes and durability. Here, we have highlighted the different forms of PCMs, such as nanoporous, mesoporous, graphene, metal, and metal oxides based carbon composites for water-splitting reactions and their significance in important energy storage devices (metal-air batteries and fuel cells). This review is mainly focused on the various approaches for the preparation of porous carbon-based materials over the last ten years and the fabricated materials that could be applied in large-scale practical energy-related applications. In addition, we summarize the most promising strategies for the development of morphological structural based electrocatalysts to enhance their electrocatalytic performances for both OER and HER activities are discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000797688100001

Herein, as a newly proposed concept, a facile temperature-induced on-site conversion approach (TOCA) is developed to realize the transformation of MoO(4)units to C-Mo-S triatomic coordination in hierarchical hollow architecture. The optimized hybrid (denoted as MoCS(x)1000) shows accelerating oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics and excellent stability, which are superior to the most reported Mo-based catalysts. Extended X-ray adsorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis and computational studies reveal that the near-range electronic steering at C-Mo-S triatomic-coordinated nanointerface guarantees moderate ORR intermediates adsorption and thus is responsible for the boosted ORR activity. This work sheds light on exploring the intrinsic activity of catalysts by interfacial electronic steering.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000554045800001	32725776

Here, petal-like Ni (OH)(2) nanosheets with tunable size and thickness, which represent controllable electrocatalytically active areas, are directly grown on conductive Ni foam. As a result, the optimized in situ-grown Ni (OH)(2) nanosheets (NSNs) show optimum HER performance and stability compared to step-by-step-grown NSNs with similar surface areas due to the enhanced carrier transfer efficiency. The in situ NSNs show high HER activity with overpotentials of 187 and 137 mV with respective current densities of 20 and 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution.

In this study, a highly active and durable single-atom W-doped NiS0.5Se0.5 nanosheet @ NiS0.5Se0.5 nanorod heterostructure (W-NiS0.5Se0.5) electrocatalyst is prepared. W-NiS0.5Se0.5 exhibits excellent catalytic activity for the HER and OER with ultralow overpotentials (39 and 106 mV for the HER and 171 and 239 mV for the OER at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively) and excellent long-term durability (500 h), outperforming commercial precious-metal catalysts and many other previously reported transition-metal-based compounds (TMCs). The introduction of single-atom W delocalizes the spin state of Ni, which results in an increase in the Ni d-electron density. This causes the optimization of the adsorption/desorption process of H and a significant reduction in the adsorption free energy of the rate-determining step (O* -> OOH*), thus accelerating the thermodynamics and kinetics of the HER and OER. This work provides a rational feasible strategy to design single-atom catalysts for water splitting and to develop advanced TMC electrocatalysts by regulating delocalized spin states.									28	0	0	0	5	0	28			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000758052100001	35080286

However, application of the phase equilibria modeling for seven representative samples of mafic granulites from xenoliths of the Udachnaya kimberlite pipe, Yakutia, revealed that a granulitic garnet + clinopyroxene + plagioclase +/- orthopyroxene +/- amphibole +/- scapolite mineral assemblage was likely formed in the middle crust under amphibolite facies conditions (600-650 degrees C and 0.8-1.0 GPa) in a deficiency of fluid. Clinopyroxene in the rocks is characterized by elevated aegirine content (up to 10 mol.%) both in the earlier magmatic cores and in the later metamorphic rim zones of the grains. Nevertheless, the phase equilibrium modeling for all samples indicates surprisingly reduced conditions, i.e. oxygen fugacity 1.6-3.3 log units below the FMQ (Fayalite-Magnetite-Quartz) buffer. In contrast, the coexistence of Fe-Ti oxides indicates temperatures of 850-990 degrees C and oxygen fugacity about lg(FMQ) +/- 0.5, conditions which correspond to earlier stages of rock evolution. Reduction of oxygen fugacity during cooling is discussed in the context of the evolution of a complex fluid. The reconstructed P-T conditions for the final equilibration in the mafic granulites indicate that temperatures were similar to 250 degrees C higher than those extrapolated from the continental conductive geotherm of 35-40 mu W/m(2) deduced from peridotite xenoliths of the Udachnaya pipe. Although the granulites resided in the crust for a period for at least 1.4 Ga, they did not re-equilibrate to the temperatures of the geotherm, likely due to the blocking of mineral reactions under relatively low temperatures and fluid-deficient conditions									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0301-9268	1872-7433		WOS:000652097000005

Here, we introduced t-butyl-dimethylsilyllithium as a single-source precursor for depositing LixSiyOz with an integrated network of siloxane moieties as an artificial cathode/electrolyte interphase (ACEI) which stabilizes LMR-NCM by mitigating oxygen release, electrolyte degradation and preventing fractures. Using solid-state NMR coupled with dynamic nuclear polarization, detailed molecular-level characterization of the ACEI is presented. The proposed CEI enabled improved energy-density at high rates (644 Wh.kg(-1), compared to uncoated material with 457 Wh.kg(-1) at 4C) with suppressed parasitic reactions and O-2 evolution. The efficacy of the CEI is demonstrated in full graphite/LMR-NCM pouch cells with similar to 35% enhanced capacity and > 80% capacity retention over 200 cycles. Altogether, these results present the importance of careful selection and design of surface chemistry for stabilizing the electrode/electrolyte interphase in challenging battery chemistries.									21	0	0	0	2	0	21			2405-8297			WOS:000598784400010

Particularly, the development of low-cost and efficient electrocatalyst gained attention for large-scale energy and clean-energy production. But now the emphasis is on developing low-cost and efficient electrocatalyst materials that show more than one electrocatalytic reactions. Hence, we have developed a highly porous and active edge plane exposed beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet on low-cost and flexible stainless-steel mesh (SSM) and investigated its catalytic activity for oxidation of urea, hydrazine, and water. The as-prepared beta-Ni(OH)(2)/SSM demonstrates the excellent catalytic activity towards the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with potential lower than the 1.45 V vs. RHE, 1.34 V vs. RHE, and 1.51 V vs. RHE at 50 mA/cm(2) current density, respectively. Furthermore, the as-prepared electrocatalyst demonstrates excellent stability in UOR, HzOR, and OER for long time. The promising electrocatalytic activity of as-prepared beta-Ni(OH)(2)/SSM electrocatalyst is attributed to the highly porous, and edge plane exposed binder-free thin nanosheets grown on SSM, which also adds to the mechanical structure stability and a large amount of mass transportation during electrocatalytic activity.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000591383100001

J	Biswas, RG; Rajendran, M; Walker, GS; Williams, E; Bhattacharya, AK				Walker, Gavin S/C-6024-2013				Electrical transport studies and temperature-programmed oxygen evolution of PrO1.83								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE				33	12			3001	3007		10.1023/A:1004315032552				JUN 15 1998	1998	The phases in the homologous series PrnO2n-2 (n=11 10, 9 and 7) have been studied by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient measurements using PrO1.83 as the starting material. TPR measurements in helium indicate that oxygen evolution from PrO1.83 occurs in three distinct steps and quantification of the oxygen evolution shows the formation of the phases PrnO2n-2 (n = 10, 9 and 7). Temperature-dependent electrical conductivity measurements for p(O-2)=O show breaks in the conductivity which occur at 635, 714 and 797 K, whereas in air the breaks occur only at 720 and 953 K. These correspond to the compositionally controlled phase transitions. The Arrhenius conductivity expression has been used to calculate the activation energies and pre-exponential factors in the stoichiometric regions. Results from TPR and conductivity experiments indicate that PrO1.83 and PrO1.71 have easily established temperature ranges of composition while PrO1.80 and PrO1.78 have stability ranges which are very much smaller. Seebeck coefficient measurements (thermopower) as a function of oxygen partial pressure and temperature indicate that the conduction changes from n to p type for the composition PrO1.71 The approximate independence of the Seebeck coefficient with temperature fits the Heikes theory for a hopping conductor. The discrepancies in the earlier reports on the conductivity of PrO1.83 are attributed to the variations in the p(O-2) employed, rate of heating and also to a certain extent the partial hydroxylation and carbonation of the samples used. The results of the present experiments point out these aspects and ciarify the discrepancies between previously published data.

Natural erionite fibers were chosen because of their established toxicity. Macrophages (cell line NR8383) were loaded with the dye 5-(and 6)-carboxy-2',7'-dichlorodihydronuorescein diacetate and exposed to erionite particles by centrifuging cells and fibers together to effect adherence. Reactive oxygen metabolite generation was examined by monitoring the fluorescence of oxidized dye formed via the reaction with oxygen species produced during phagocytosis. Individual cells were repeatedly scanned for up to 2 hr to monitor the evolution of this fluorescence. It was found that erionite-exposed cells had a mean total fluorescence of three times that of controls during the first 35 min, declining to two times that of controls at 35-60 min and about the same level as that of controls at 60-80 min. Ultrastructural studies of similarly treated aliquots of cells showed marked variation in size and numbers of the phagocytized particles. This study demonstrates that intracellular oxidation can be monitored on a single cell basis over a period of time. Quantitative studies are in progress to establish the relationship between the phagocytized particulate load and the extent of fluorescence.									25	0	0	0	16	1	25			0091-6765	1552-9924		WOS:A1997XV54700016	9294716

Though CeO2-supported Pt nanoparticles are often more active than their single-atom counterparts, the former could easily redisperse to Pt single atom under oxidizing diesel conditions. Therefore, to maximize the reactivity of every Pt atom, it is important to fully understand the reaction mechanism of CeO2-supported Pt single atoms. Here, we report a CO oxidation study on a Pt/CeO2 single-atom catalyst, where we can account for all of the neighbors using in situ and operando spectroscopy techniques and microcalorimetric measurements. Coupled with density functional theory calculations, we present a comprehensive picture of the dynamics of the surface species, the role of surface intermediates, and explain the observed reaction kinetics. We started with a catalyst containing exclusively single atoms and used in situ/operando spectroscopy to provide evidence for their stability during the reaction and to identify the Pt1 complexes before and during the reaction and their binding to CO. The results reveal that in the precatalyst, Pt is present as Pt(O)(4) on the CeO2(111) step edge sites, but during CO oxidation, we find that two Pt-1 complexes coexist, representing two states of the same active site in the reaction cycle. The dominant state/complex remains Pt(O)(4), which adsorbs CO very weakly as shown by CO microcalorimetry. The second, minority state/complex, Pt(CO)(O)(3) is generated through the reaction of Pt(O)(4) with CO, and CO is bound strongly to Pt-1. Labile oxygen adatoms from the CeO2 surface play a major role in the regeneration of Pt(O)(4) either directly from Pt(O)(3) or by reaction with the strongly adsorbed CO in Pt(CO)(O)(3). We show that the formation of an oxygen vacancy and generation of a labile O* are not barrierless, which explains the long lifetime of Pt(CO)(O)(3) and its detectability despite being a minority complex. The results help to develop a comprehensive view of the dynamic evolution of Pt-1 complexes along the reaction cycle and provide mechanistic insights to guide the design of Pt-based single-atom catalysts.									14	1	0	0	1	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000674927200029

Karimi, Nader/0000-0002-4559-6245			Numerical modelling of unsteady transport and entropy generation in oxy-combustion of single coal particles with varying flow velocities and oxygen concentrations								APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING				144				147	164		10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2018.08.040				NOV 5 2018	2018	Unsteady generation of entropy and transfer of heat and chemical species in the transient oxy-combustion of a single coal particle are investigated numerically. The burning process takes place in oxygen and nitrogen atmospheres with varying chemical compositions and under either quiescent or active flows. The combustion simulations are validated against the existing experimental data on a single coal particle burning in a drop. tube reactor. The spatio-temporal evolutions of the gas-phase temperature and major gaseous species con- centration fields as well as that of entropy generation are investigated for the two types of gas flow. It is shown that the rates of production and transport of chemical species reach their maximum level during the homogenous combustion of volatiles and decay subsequently. Yet, the transient transfer of heat of combustion continues for a relatively long time after the termination of particle life time. This results in the generation of a large amount of thermal entropy at post-combustion stage. The analyses further indicate that the entropy generated by the chemical reactions is the most significant source of unsteady irreversibilities. Most importantly, it is demonstrated that a slight oxygenation of the atmosphere leads to major increases in the total chemical entropy generation and, thus it significantly intensifies the global irreversibilities of the process. However, upon exceeding a certain mole fraction of oxygen in the atmosphere, further addition of oxygen only causes minor increases in entropy generation. This trend is observed consistently in both quiescent and active flow cases.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1359-4311			WOS:000451499600015

Strong adhesion of palladium monolayer to the TiC(001) support, accompanied by a modification of electronic structure of the supported palladium, is evidenced. Compared with Pt(111) surface, the MLPd/TiC(001) can enhance the adsorption of O-2, leading to comparable dissociation barrier and a smaller diffusion barrier of O-2. Whilst the adsorption strength of atomic O (the dissociation product of O-2) on MLPd/TiC(001) is similar to that on the Pt(111) surface, possessing high mobility, our theoretical results indicate that MLPd/TiC(001) may serve as a good catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction.

Previously, it was shown that small silver cluster can control the rate of discharge at the cathode of lithium-oxygen battery. The gap near the fermi energy was shown to control the oxygen reduction, an important reaction for LiO2 formation. Controlling the gap would ultimately control the rate of LiO2 formation. One can vary the size of the cluster to vary the gap, however, this "knob" provides limited variance in the gap. Alloying, in combination with size variation offer a much wider control of the gap, hence the LiO2 formation. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT), we determined the most stable geometry of the bimetallic clusters Pd3M2 and calculated the binding energies of these clusters on the alumina substrate which ranges from 0.2 eV to 0.25 eV depending upon the composition of the alloy-cluster, its orientation and the adsorption site. We also find that Pd atoms bind strongly with the substrate oxygen atoms with an average short bond-length of about 2.2 angstrom. We explored how the gap at the Fermi level of the system varies as a function of elemental composition and the calculated gap ranges from 0 meV to 90 meV. Charges distribution using Bader analysis was also performed to probe how charges are transferred between the cluster and the substrate. These preliminary results will open the door for more systematic studies of alloy clusters of different size and stoichiometry for Li-O-2 battery cathode design.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0039-6028	1879-2758		WOS:000563537000003

The reasonable interface modulation can effectively lead to the optimization of electronic configuration through the interface electron transfer in the heterostructures and thus resulting in the enhanced efficiency. In this work, self-supported and heterogeneous interface-rich Ni3S2@FeNi2S4@NF electrocatalyst for overall water splitting was designed and prepared through a controllable step-wise hydrothermal process. Density functional theory calculations suggest that heterogeneous interface formed between Ni3S2 and FeNi2S4 can optimize the Gibbs free energy for H* adsorption (DGH*). Benefiting from the open structure of the nanosheet arrays, the abundant heterogeneous interfaces in Ni3S2@FeNi2S4@NF composite, the positive synergistic effect between Ni3S2 and FeNi2S4, and the good conductivity of foamed nickel (NF) substrate, the optimized Ni3S2@FeNi2S4@NF nanoarray catalyst displayed excellent electrocatalytic activities, the overpotential is only 83 mV and 235 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Importantly, an alkaline electrolyser directly using the Ni3S2@FeNi2S4@NF as both the anode and cathode achieved an ultralow cell voltage of 1.46 V, accompanied by outstanding stability. The performance is better than that of most other transition-metal sulfides electrocatalysts. This work may provide a useful strategy for reasonably regulating heterogeneous interfaces to effectively improve the performance of materials, thus accelerating the practical application of transition-metal sulfides electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.

This stems from the absence of a clear picture of the structural evolution of Au NPs at near reaction conditions, i.e., at high pressures and high temperatures. We hereby report real-space observations of the equilibrium shapes of titania-supported Au NPs under O-2 and H-2 at atmospheric pressure using gas transmission electron microscopy. In situ TEM observations show instantaneous changes in the equilibrium shape of Au NPs during cooling under O-2 from 400 degrees C to room temperature. In comparison, no instant change in equilibrium shape is observed under a H-2 environment. To interpret these experimental observations, the equilibrium shape of Au NPs under O-2 atomic oxygen, and H-2 is predicted using a multiscale structure reconstruction model. Excellent agreement between TEM observations and theoretical modeling of Au NPs under O-2 provides strong evidence for the molecular adsorption of oxygen on the Au NPs below 120 degrees C on specific Au facets, which are identified in this work. In the case of H-2, theoretical modeling predicts no interaction with gold atoms that explain their high morphological stability under this gas. This work provides atomic structural information for the fundamental understanding of the O-2 and H-2 adsorption properties of Au NPs under real working conditions and shows a way to identify the active sites of heterogeneous nanocatalysts under reaction conditions by monitoring the structure reconstruction.									27	4	0	0	2	0	29			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000460199400101	30620561

The obtained Pt foam/C was readily purified by simple washing with water and chLoroform at room temperature. Unlike commercial Pt/C composed of quasi-spherical nanoparticles, Pt foam/C consists of convoluted dendritic nanosheets. Interestingly, Pt foam/C demonstrated both improved durability and activity toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The improved durability is because of the formation of metastable nano-holes among dendritic branches of Pt foam/C under ripening, preserving the surface area. The activity enhancement of Pt foam/C can be attributed to predominanty exposed Pt {1,1,0} Wanes that possess the highest ORR activity among all [ow-indexed Pt crysta[Line Wanes. Nano-scale Pt primarily enclosed by {1,1,0} Wanes has not been reported previously.									8	2	0	0	0	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000364020400020

Herein, we employ a weak electrochemical activation protocol at the marginal positive potential (-0.3-0.5 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode [RHE]) to investigate the surface optimization and evolution of nickel-iron phosphides. The as-formed oxygen-abundant FePi/NiFeP synergy contributes to the enhanced catalytic activity, which requires only 210 mV and 270 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. This work provides new evidence on the surface evolution and adaptive reconstruction of transition phosphides for efficient water oxidation. The greater understanding of pre-catalysts may inspire more rational design strategies for efficient electrocatalysts.									28	2	0	0	3	0	28			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000481578000018

By combining synchrotron-based operando X-ray absorption and infrared spectroscopies, here we uncover at an atomic level a hydroxyl was coupled on the dynamically released coordination-unsaturated Fe-N-2 moieties to form a highly active OH-Fe-N-2 structure and then promotes the adsorption of O-2 during the catalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which greatly facilitates the fabrication of the key *OOH intermediate and simplifies the fracture of the O-O bond to accelerate the multielectron reaction kinetics. The resulting covalent organic framework-derived Fe single-site catalyst could efficiently deliver an excellent ORR catalytic activity with an extremely large kinetic current density (J(k)) of 81.3 mA cm(-2) and an extra high turnover frequency of 5804 h(-1), 20 times that of the Pt-C catalyst (288 h(-1), 7.7 mA cm(-2)).									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			2380-8195			WOS:000696180500038

H-2 production occurs via the formation of an M-H containing intermediate followed by H-H recombination and H-2 desorption from MnO2n(OH)(2) and MnO2n+2. The hydrogen transfer reactions to form the M-H bond are the rate determining steps and can be considered to be proton coupled, electron transfer (PCET) reactions with one or two electrons being transferred. Oxygen is produced by breaking two weak M-O bonds in an atomic oxygen saturated metal oxide from an MnO2n center dot O-2 intermediate. On the triplet PES, the activation energies for the first and second H transfer to the metal are calculated to be similar to 10 to 50 kcal/mol and similar to 75 to 90 kcal/mol depending on the size of the clusters and the metal. The barriers on the singlet surface for the first and the second H transfer are predicted to be 110 to 140 kcal/mol, in general larger than the H-O bond dissociation energy. The activation barriers for the step of H-H recombination are 15 to 50 kcal/mol, and the H-2 desorption energies are less than 10 kcal/mol on the singlet and triplet PESs. The oxygen desorption energies follow the order Ti < Zr < Hf for the triplets and Ti < Zr approximate to Hf for the singlets. The oxygen desorption energy is approximately independent of the size of the cluster for the same metal The water splitting reactions prefer to take place on the triplet surface. A low excess potential energy is needed to generate 2H(2) and O-2 from 2H(2)O after the endotherrnicity of the reaction is overcome on the triplet PES.									38	1	0	0	2	0	38			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000318211400029	23544659

However, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER) are a hindrance to their scalable production, whereas scarce and costly Pt and Ir/Ru-based catalysts with the highest electrocatalytic activity are commercially unviable. Since good ORR catalysts are not always efficient for OER and vice versa, so bifunctional catalysts on which OER and ORR occurs on the same electrode are very desirable. Alternative catalysts based on heteroatom-doped carbon nanomaterials, though showed good electrocatalytic activity yet their high cost and complex synthesis is not viable for scalable production. To overcome these drawbacks, biomass-derived heteroatom-doped porous carbons have recently emerged as low-cost, earth-abundant, renewable and sustainable environment-friendly materials for bifunctional oxygen catalysts. The tunable morphology, mesoporous structure and high concentration of catalytic active sites of these materials due to heteroatom (N)-doping could further enhance their ORR and OER activity, along with tolerance to methanol crossover and good durability. Thus, biomass derived heteroatom-doped porous carbons with large surface area, rich edge defects, numerous micropores and thin 2D nanoarchitecture could be suitable as efficient bifunctional oxygen catalysts. In the present article, synthesis, N-doping, ORR/OER mechanism and electrocatalytic performance of biomass derived bifunctional catalysts has been discussed. The selected biomass (chitin, eggs, euonymus japonicas, tobacco, lysine and plant residue) except wood, act as both C and N precursor, resulting in N self doping of porous carbons that avoids the use of toxic chemicals, thus making the synthesis a facile and environment-friendly green process. The synthetic strategy could be further optimized to develop future biomass-based N self-doped porous carbons as metal-free high performance bifunctional oxygen catalysts for commercial energy applications. Recent advances and the importance of biomass-based bifunctional oxygen catalysts in metal-air batteries and fuel cells has been highlighted. The material design, perspectives and future directions in this field are also provided. (C) 2021 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

This article describes the evolution of strategies devised to achieve these goals and illustrates the challenges in getting there. Particular emphasis is placed on controlling the geometry and coordination environment of the diiron core, preventing formation of polynuclear iron clusters, maintaining the structural integrity of model complexes during reactions with dioxygen, and tuning the ligand framework to stabilize desired oxygenated diiron species. Studies of the various model systems have improved our understanding of the electronic and physical characteristics of carboxylate-bridged diiron units and their reactivity toward molecular oxygen and organic moieties. The principles and lessons that have emerged from these investigations will guide future efforts to develop more sophisticated diiron protein model complexes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, one-dimensional manganese-tetracyanoquinodimethane (Mn-TCNQ) nanorods were synthesized via a simple solution-impregnation and cation exchange method, and delivered excellent electrocatalytic activity for 2e(-) ORR, with a considerable H2O2 yield of 142.6 ppm h(-1) and an outstanding H2O2 selectivity of over 98% in 0.1 M KOH. Density functional theory results revealed that *OOH can be efficiently absorbed on the Mn sites of Mn-TCNQ nanorods, and the succeeding ORR occurred through a 2e(-) pathway.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000693678900001

The activity for the oxygen and chlorine evolution reactions (OER and CER, respectively) and the dynamic responses from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the USP powders, as well as of the corresponding coatings on Ti, were analyzed and are discussed. The loss of coating activity is discussed with respect to the differences in the EIS and cyclic voltammetry responses of the coatings in their active and inactive states. The 800 degrees C-USP sample was found to be more active than the 200 degrees C-USP sample for both the CER and the OER, whereas the stability of the former was considerably lower. The correlation between the structure, composition and morphology of the powder and the coating with the registered electrochemical properties is discussed. The EIS analysis of the coating resistance distributions induced by the thermal treatment of the powder indicated a complex combination of the pore resistance and the pseudocapacitive charge transfer resistance. An additional coating resistance, due to loose grain boundaries, was introduced into the coatings in their active and inactive state. The EIS analysis indicated the changes in TiO2-enriched core/RuO2-enriched shell structure, caused by the USP temperature. (c) The Author(s) 2018.

This characterization allowed the study of thiol precursor evolution during ripening of Sauvignon blanc grapes in several viticultural situations together with grape reaction product (GRP) and the main substrate of polyphenoloxidase, that is, caftaric acid. Concentration of precursors greatly increased during ripening except for the cysteinylated conjugate of 4MMP. Precursor evolution was also monitored during the oxidation of grape juice. Addition of oxygen to a grape juice set off the enzymatic oxidation of hydroxycinnamic acids but did not negatively affect precursor concentrations. Part of the glutathionylated precursor of the 3MH was produced during prefermentative operations (up to 140% in Sauvignon blanc). Consequently, this precursor naturally occurring in grapes was also formed during prefermentative operations. The proportion of biogenetic and prefermentary formation of the glutathionylated precursor of 3MH was different under industrial conditions depending on the grape variety considered. Addition of glutathione and hexenal in grape juices of Melon B. and Sauvignon induced an increase of the production of 3MH and consequently of its acetate in the resulting wines. Residual glutathione in must has to be preserved to enhance the aromatic potential of grapes.									78	1	0	0	72	4	79			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000276232700072	20199086

Herein, we confirm that the activities of hydroxide and water govern the ODC performance and its dynamics. Experimental characterization of ODC under varying mass transfer conditions on the liquid side reveals large differences in the polarization curves as well as in potential step responses of the electrodes. Under convective transport in the liquid electrolyte, the ODC is not limited by mass transfer in its current density at j>3.9 kA m(-2), whereas transport limitations are already reached at j approximate to 1.3 kA m(-2) with a stagnant electrolyte. Since gas phase conditions do not differ significantly between the measurements, these results are in contrast the common assumption that oxygen supply determines ODC performance. A dynamic model reveals the strong influence of the electrolyte mass transfer conditions on oxygen availability and thus performance. Dynamic responses of the current density to step-wise potential changes are dominated by the mass transport of water and hydroxide ions, which is by orders of magnitude faster with convective electrolyte flow. Without convective liquid electrolyte transport, a high accumulation of hydroxide ions significantly lowers the oxygen solubility. Thus, a fast mass transport of water and hydroxide is essential for high ODC performance and needs to be ensured for technical applications. The predicted accumulation of ions is furthermore validated experimentally by means of scanning electrochemical microscopy. We also show how the outlined processes can explain the distinctively different potential step responses with and without electrolyte convection.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2196-0216			WOS:000501286600016

By means of comparison with the experimental data the rate constants for the reaction N-2(A (3)Sigma(+)(u), v) + N-2(X (1)Sigma(+)(g), v' = 0) -> N-2(A (3)Sigma(+)(u), v - 2) + N-2(X (1)Sigma(+)(g), v' = 1) have been clarified. It is assumed that the probability of population of N-2(A (3)Sigma(+)(u), v) states by collisional deactivation of N-2(B (3)Pi(g), v') molecules is proportional to the Franck-Condon factors of correspondent N-2(B (3)Pi(g), v') -> N-2(A (3)Sigma(+)(u), v) transitions, i.e. that the quenching is essentially vertical. The results of calculations carried out under this assumption are in agreement with measured N-2(A (3)Sigma(+)(u), v) vibrational distribution at the end of pulsed high current discharge in nitrogen.Study of a variation of the population of vibrational level N-2(A (3)Sigma(+)(u), v = 0) in the afterglow of streamer discharge in nitrogen at atmospheric pressure has been performed. It is shown that the dynamics of N-2(A (3)Sigma(+)(u), v = 0) number density depends essentially not only on their loss in the pooling reaction N-2(A (3)Sigma(+)(u), v) + N-2(A (3)Sigma(+)(u), v) -> product, but also on additional population due to the quenching of high vibrational levels. The fraction of dissociation channel in the process of N-2(A (3)Sigma(+)(u), v) deactivation by oxygen molecules have been calculated. It is shown that temporal evolution of the fraction of the dissociation channel is first of all associated with a variation of the relative population of the vibrational level N-2(A (3)Sigma(+)(u), v = 0). In air discharge plasma at high pressure, the population of N-2(A (3)Sigma(+)(u), v = 0) state is relatively low, so the fraction of the dissociation channel in the deactivation of all electronically excited states of nitrogen by oxygen exceeds 90-95%.									32	1	0	0	0	0	32			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000323303400006

Cobalt phosphides (CoxP) have been recently demonstrated as one of the most promising HER candidates in acidic electrolytes. However, the fabrication methods are normally tedious and produce only a small amount (few milligrams) of catalyst. In this paper, we report a one-pot, large-scale (tens of grams), simple synthesis of cobalt phosphide nanoparticles with impressive HER activities. The CoxP catalyst, when obtained using suitable reaction conditions, shows a high cathodic current density at a low overpotential and a small Tafel slope (approximately 58 mV dec(-1)). Thus, this study provides a practically promising approach to fabricate cost effective catalysts at a large scale for electrochemical hydrogen production.									54	1	0	0	1	0	54			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000382015100038

In this work, a facile and friendly way to synthesis of CoSe2 hollow microspheres was reported by using organic selenium source. The growth mechanism of CoSe2 hollow microspheres attributed to the Kirkendall effect with the hydrothermal reaction time is studied. This CoSe2 hollow structure with high surface roughness makes this material to expose more active sites, bringing good HER activity with a small tafel slope of 55 mV center dot dec(-1). Besides, the HER activity of CoSe2 was greatly improved via the introduction of graphene (CoSe2@G) without changing its hollow structure. The superior HER activity of CoSe2@G with a lower tafel slope of 42 mV center dot dec(-1) was attributed to the crucial structural-functional coupling effects. Moreover, both CoSe2 and CoSe2@G nanocomposites exhibit high durability and stability, which may provide promising applications in the fields of catalysis, optics, electronics and sensors due to its unique structure.

Herein, nanoplates of tungsten oxide and its hydrates (WO3.H2O) as promising electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are reported. The square-shaped and stacked WO3.H2O nanoplates are synthesized at room temperature under air in ethanol only, making it as a promising green synthesis strategy. The repeated electrochemical cyclic voltammetry cycles modified the surface of WO3.H2O nanoplates to WO3 as confirmed by Xray photoelectron and Auger spectroscopy, which leads to an improved HER activity. Hydrogen evolution is further achieved from distilled water (pH 5.67) producing 1 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 15 mV versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Moreover, WO3.H2O and WO3 nanoplates demonstrate excellent durability in acidic and neutral media, which is highly desirable for practical application. Improved hydrogen evolution by WO3(200) when compared to that by Pt(111) is further substantiated by the density functional theory calculations.									45	0	0	0	2	0	45			2470-1343			WOS:000418744000078	31457286

Herein, this work demonstrates a novel strategy for the synthesis of nickel cobalt oxides/sulfides/phosphides composite (denoted as NiCoO-2P/S) nanoarrays on Ni foam. In this method, Ni-Co bimetallic oxide nanowires on Ni foam were partially phos- phorized and sulfurized simultaneously in situ to yield Ni-Co oxide/sulfide/phosphide composite. The NiCoO-2P/S arrays have good interfacial effects and display many holes in the nanowires, giving it the advantage of large accessible surfaces on the nanowires and a beneficial for the release of gas bubbles, resulting in an excellent OER performance with a low overpotential (h) of 254 mV at 100 mA cm-2 and good HER activity (h10 = 143 mV at 10 mA cm-2). The electrocatalytic test results demonstrate small Tafel slopes (82 mV dec-1 for HER, 88 mV dec-1 for OER) and the satisfying durability in an alkaline electrolyte, indicating that the HER and OER activity was enhanced by the introduction of the Ni/Co sulfides and phosphides into Ni-Co oxides composite nanowires. Furthermore, the as- prepared NiCoO-2P/S catalyst can be used as both the anode and the cathode simulta- neously to realize overall water splitting in the two-electrode electrolyzer. This system can be driven at low cell voltages of 1.50 and 1.68 V to achieve current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm-2, respectively.

However, further improvement in their electrocatalytic performance necessitates methods to couple high-throughput MOF synthesis and their subsequent electrochemical activity characterization. In this work, scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) is employed to perform a localized, micron-scale electrosynthesis of two types of MOFs, Al-2(OH)(2)-TCPP, and HKUST-1. SECM is also utilized to analyze the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction activity of the as-prepared MOF micropatterns, via i) substrate-generation tip-collection mode to map the MOF's electrochemical reactivity, and ii) redox competition mode, to accurately extract the MOF's catalytic onset potential. Thus, the presented method provides a means to shed light on the operation principles of electroactive MOFs, toward their future incorporation in alternative fuel-production schemes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000750017300001

Nevertheless, the carbonization yield of the lysine is usually just around 5% due to the small molecular size and harsh polymerization condition for lysine to form the stable carbonization counterpart. Renewable biomass branched poly(L-lysine) (BPL) is hereby exploited to synthesize nitrogen-containing porous carbon flake (NPCF). Notably, the fabrication process is essentially an in situ thermal polymerization and pyrolysis with mesoporous silica template strategy, which avoids the usage of metal catalysts. Indeed, a metal-free mesoporous carbon with a high carbon yield of 20.1% and improved nitrogen-doping content of up to 9.6 at. % is achieved. As a result, the as-prepared NPCFs serve as metal-free electrocatalysts toward the efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In particular, one of the samples (NPCF-700/900) exhibits highly efficient ORR performance of oxygen-reduction voltage at 0.809 V in cyclic voltammogram measurement, onset peak at 0.93 V, and semi wave peak of 0.83 V in rotating disk electrode linear sweep voltammetry curves. The associated kinetic-limiting and diffusion-limiting current densities are 18.4 and -4.89 mA cm(-1), respectively. This can be attributed to the abundance of nitrogen dopant of 8.3 at. % in a high graphitization carbon framework that possesses a large specific surface area (1431 m(2) g(-1)). More importantly, NPCF-700/900 delivers excellent cycle stability and endurance with regards to methanol permeation and CO poisoning, making it a hopeful metal-free ORR electrocatalyst superior to that of the Pt/C in basic conditions.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2574-0962			WOS:000644737800037

Moreover, the presence of Ni/NiO (2.26%), O (6.56%), N (0.74%) and C (90.44%) from EDAX analysis further confirms the formation of Ni/NiO@rGO and it also supported by FTIR studies.

Highly efficient metal-free ethylenediamine-functionalized fullerene (EDA@C-60) electrocatalytic system for enhanced hydrogen generation from hydrazine hydrate								NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY				46	29			14004	14009		10.1039/d2nj01392d		JUL 2022		JUL 25 2022	2022	A synthesized non-precious metal-free electrocatalyst is demonstrated using the hydrazine hydrate oxidation reaction as a model reaction of hydrogen production. The C-60 nanocomposite functionalized with ethylenediamine (EDA@C-60) was fabricated using a simple chemical approach. The EDA@C-60 composites were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive analysis of X-rays, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electrochemical techniques. In this study, the nitrogen lone pairs from the ethylenediamine surface-functionalized on C-60 are responsible for the further enhancement of electrocatalytic activity towards the hydrazine oxidation reaction. Comparative electrochemical studies with acid-treated C-60, i.e., O-C-60, and the further-functionalized ethylenediamine catalysts (EDA@C-60) demonstrated high performance, which was ascribed to their inferior onset potential and better stability. The electrochemical measurements indicate that the EDA@C-60 composites demonstrate twice the current density (20 mA cm(-2)) and a better onset potential (0.2 V vs. SCE) than O-C-60 for hydrazine oxidation. The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of the O-C-60 and EDA@C-60 electrocatalysts indicate onset potentials of 0.37 V vs. SCE and 0.20 V vs. SCE, respectively. The experimental and analytical studies found that the nanocomposites with ethylenediamine, i.e., EDA@C-60, not only extend the surface area compared to that of O-C-60, but also promote the self-decomposition of hydrazine molecules.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000822036600001

DOM in water at concentrations of up to 40 mg L-1 was found to have little contribution to capacitance loss and shift of the EPZC. However, the effect of iron scaling was noticeable at levels as low as 0.2 mg L-1 Fe2+ by an accelerated capacitance loss and delay of the EPZC shift. Elemental analysis, at different points of the electrode lifetime, showed that oxygen incorporation on the surface occurs mostly during the first 15 to 20 cycles of operation. Over this time frame, the amount of oxygen was observed to increase by approximately 4 times. Correspondingly, the contact angle decreased on average from approximately 130 degrees to 34 degrees, indicating an increase in wettability over this period. Mechanistically, this study supports the hypothesis that the surface oxide layer forms and dominates at an early cycling stage, but CO2 evolution becomes the main Faradaic reaction as cycling progresses.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0011-9164	1873-4464		WOS:000791333300003

As a result of the synthesis method, the introduction of the metallic cations into the crystalline structure substituting Ti(4+)or K(+)cations depending on the case was achieved. For instance, Co(2+)cations were introduced instead of Ti(4+)cations, while Ni(2+)and Cu(2+)were introduced on both sides. The metal-cation introduction between the tunnels favored the growth of K-poor phases as impurities, especially in the CuO loaded K(2)Ti(6)O(13)samples. The presence of these metallic oxides modified the structural and optical properties by forming oxygen vacancies in some samples, favoring the photocatalytic CO(2)reduction in aqueous media to low-weight compounds, such as formaldehyde, methanol, methane, and hydrogen, under visible-light irradiation. Enhanced selectivity of the evolved product, as a result of the metallic cation nature and the formed impurities, was observed. For instance, Co(3)O(4)favored the evolution of formaldehyde in the most efficient sample (1 Co-KTO; 453.2 mu mol g(-1)) as a result of the low quantity of impurities present in samples; NiO favored the hydrogen evolution reaction (1 Ni-KTO; 201 mu mol g(-1)), possibly due to the photo-reforming of the organic compounds; and CuO enhanced the methanol and hydrogen production (159.7 and 282 mu mol g(-1), respectively in 1 Cu-KTO) due to the formation of oxygen vacancies as active sites for the photocatalytic process and reducing the photo-generated charge recombination.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000571715100001

For practical application of such technologies, suppressing hydrogen evolution reaction and facilitating the activation of stable CO2 molecules still remain major challenges. Furthermore, high production selectivity toward high-value chemicals such as ethylene, ethanol, and even n-propanol is also not easy task to achieve. To settle these challenges, deeper understanding on underlying basis of reactions such as how intermediate binding affinities can be engineered at catalyst surfaces need to be discussed. In this review, we briefly outline recent strategies to modulate the binding energies of key intermediates for CO2 reduction reactions, based on theoretical insights from density functional theory calculation studies. In addition, important design principles of catalysts and electrolytes are also provided, which would contribute to the development of highly active catalysts for CO2 electroreduction.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2196-5404			WOS:000461046600001	30859347	
J	Weisenburger, Gerald A.; Barnhart, Richard W.; Steeno, Gregory S.					Barnhart, Richard/0000-0002-7666-8942			Measurement of Gas Flow Rates from Small-Scale Reactions								ORGANIC PROCESS RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT				12	6			1299	1304		10.1021/op800194g				NOV-DEC 2008	2008	The rate and total volume of noncondensable gas generation are important parameters in the safe, successful scale-up of chemical processes. Information regarding the evolution of noncondensable gas is used to (1) ensure the gas can be vented from the reactor without overpressurization, (2) calculate the concentration of flammable gases (or oxygen) to avoid creating an explosive mixture in the equipment, and (3) size the scrubber to ensure the capacity and heat removal rate are sufficient. The data are used in parallel with information regarding the heat of reaction from the desired chemistry, thermal stability of reaction mixtures/components, and an intimate knowledge of the process to analyze the risk associated with scaling up. If the level of risk is judged to be unacceptable, the analysis can be used to make rational process changes in order to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. Several techniques have been developed to study the gas hazards associated with a particular reaction. In general, these techniques suffer from at least one of two primary limitations: (1) the volume is not measured directly, causing the condition and/or composition of the gas to influence the accuracy of the measurement, or (2) the sensitivity is too low to take reliable measurements from small-scale reactions. The Pfizer Global Process Safety Network set out to develop a new device that could solve both of these problems and be used in conjunction with a microcalorimeter to provide heat of reaction data in parallel. This paper describes a new device that is used in series with a thermal mass flow meter to accomplish this goal. Detailed discussion of the error bounds on the flow rate from this device is also included.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1083-6160			WOS:000261137000038

Here, it is shown that the degradation of chemical solution derived PZT thin-films in humid conditions is driven by the system's electrochemical activity toward water electrolysis. The layer stacks with Pt-based electrodes exhibited a faster degradation rate owing to their higher electrocatalytic activity compared to Au. A degradation model is proposed based on the electrolysis of liquid or gaseous H2O, involving the evolution of oxygen and hydrogen gas at the top and bottom electrodes. Degradation proceeds above the threshold voltage for a given electrode system and is driven by the evolution and pressure build-up of gaseous species at the PZT/electrode interfaces. The pressure build-up causes film cracking, delamination of the film and electrodes, electrothermal breakdown events, and eventually time-dependent dielectric breakdown. Significantly larger post-breakdown crater sizes in humid than in dry conditions suggests that larger cracks through which dielectric breakdown through humidified air can occur. Overall, these effects are shown to cause sample failure up to six orders of magnitude of time earlier than for operation in dry conditions. Thus, in order to improve the resilience of thin-film systems in humid conditions, it is imperative to protect the electrochemically active electrode components of the device.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0021-8979	1089-7550		WOS:000544860000001

The formation and evolution of oxygen functional groups were systematically investigated as a function of the HNO3 concentration on MWCNTs with different structural and morphological characteristics, employing temperature-programmed desorption coupled with mass spectrometry, thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry, Raman spectroscopy and N-2 porosimetry analysis.. Hydrothermal treatment provides controlled MWCNT modification by specific oxygen functionalities at amounts determined by the morphology, texture and crystallinity of the pristine materials. Hydrothermal oxidation competes well with the harsh boiling nitric acid treatment regarding the total amount of oxygen functionalities, while requiring much lower amounts of oxidizing agent and, most importantly, reducing amorphous carbon deposits on the MWCNT surface, a major drawback of aggressive liquid phase oxidation methods. Detailed pore structure analysis revealed a progressive increase of the surface area upon hydrothermal functionalization, whereas the mesopore structure varied consistently with the intrinsic MWCNT properties related to the packing of the nanotube bundles and the reduction of amorphous carbon. These advantageous features render nitric acid hydrothermal oxidation an efficient functionalization process to fine tune and optimize the surface chemistry of MWCNTs for target applications, circumventing the need for additional purification post-processing.

In this work, it is demonstrated that the COF-TpPa with keto-enol tautomerism equilibrium structure shows excellent performance (yield>99% after 8 h) in the selective photocatalytic oxidative coupling of amines to imines under visible light irradiation. It is revealed that three kinds of reactive oxygen species (superoxide radical, hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen) participate in this photocatalytic oxidation reaction. In addition, hydrogen protons cleaved from the benzyl are proven to be reduced to hydrogen in the conduction band of COF-TpPa in anaerobic atmosphere, accompanied with the formation of imines. The direct hydrogen evolution from amine provides an effective way to extract clean energy from organic molecule as well as the production of value-added chemicals. As a contrast, COF-LZU1 with similar structure and chemical composition to COF-TpPa but without keto-enol tautomerism exhibits worse optical properties and photocatalytic performance. It is also demonstrated that keto-enol tautomerism favors the adsorption of benzylamine based on the characterization results and theoretical calculations.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1674-7291	1869-1870		WOS:000713908100001

In particular, their bifunctional activity for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) is attractive for electrochemical splitting of water. However, pristine carbon materials have low activities for HER/OER. Here, a high-performance carbon electrocatalyst is demonstrated by first pyrolyzing a metal-organic framework (MOF), i.e., zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), followed by optimized cathodic polarization treatment (CPT). Pyrolyzing ZIF-8 produces a highly N-doped (8.4 at%) carbon material having a large specific surface area of 1017 m(2) g(-1) with micro and mesopores. CPT in 0.5 M H2SO4 for up to 8 hours modulates the composition of N-and O-containing surface functional groups of the pyrolyzed ZIF-8 without sacrificing its large surface area and pore size distribution. After the 6-hour CPT, this material shows an excellent HER activity in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte with an overpotential of 155 mV, a Tafel slope of 54.7 mV dec(-1), and an exchange current density of 0.063 mA cm(-2). And the 4-hour CPT results in excellent OER activity in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte with an overpotential of 476 mV and a Tafel slope of 78.5 mV dec(-1). In a demonstration, these two carbon electrocatalysts steadily run a two-electrode water electrolyzer at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) over 8 hours under a potential of 1.82 V with a Faradaic efficiency of 98.0-99.1% in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The superior activity of the designed carbon electrocatalysts can be attributed to the functional group composition modulation achieved by CPT. High-performance metal-free carbon electrocatalysts derived from MOFs show excellent potentials for energy and environmental applications.									35	2	0	0	2	0	36				2052-1537		WOS:000418622500010

The thermal reactions products were measured by XRD and electron microscopy. The LiFePO(4) and LiMnPO(4) cathode materials were found to have comparable thermal stability in their pristine and fully delithiated states. The onset temperatures of the thermal reactions are lower in EC/DMC than in EC/PC solutions but the specific heat evolution of all the thermal reactions are higher with EC-PC solutions. No evidence was found that delithiated LiMnPO(4) or Li[MnFe]PO(4) have lower thermal stability than delithiated LiFePO(4). The thermal reactivity of the layered LiCoO(2) and LiNi(0.8)Co(0.15)Al(0.05)O(2) cathode materials was found to be comparable to that of the LiMPO(4) materials.

Herein, we are the first to report the growth of Co nanoparticle-integrated nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) on porous carbon nanofibers by simply heating in the situ-developed metal-organic framework (MOF)-based electrospun nanofibrous membrane with no need for an external supply of any additional precursors and reducing gases. The long and entangled N-CNTs originating from highly porous and graphitic carbon nanofibers offer good flexibility, large surface area, high porosity, high conductivity, the homogeneous incorporation of heteroatoms and metallic constituents, and an abundant exposure of active nanocatalytic sites. The as-developed nano-assembly demonstrates attractive characteristics for electrocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions and electrochemical energy storage. This strategy of integrating the essence of an MOF with electrospinning offers a new, direct, and cost-effective approach for making N-doped CNT-based multifunctional membranes.									18	0	0	0	3	0	18			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000657202500038	33977710

Physical characterization of RuO2-Ta2O5 by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) shows presence of no impurity. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of different compositions of RuO2-Ta2O5 reveals that addition of Ta2O5 to RuO2 upto 10% results in solid solution and beyond 10% Ta2O5, RuO2 and Ta2O5 maintain their phases. XRD and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals uniform formation of RuO2-Ta2O5 particles with a size of 10-15 nm. Electrochemical characterization carried out by cyclic voltammetry for different ratios of RuO2-Ta2O5 catalysts in 1.0 M H3PO4 electrolyte gives maximum current density of 17.27 mA cm(-2) at 1.2 V for 90% RuO2-10%Ta2O5 anode catalyst at 90 degrees C. Linear sweep voltammetry of 90%RuO2-10%Ta2O5 using rotating ring disk electrode at different rotations (800-2000 rpm) indicates high activity towards OER. The prepared RuO2-Ta2O5 anode electrocatalysts tested in the high temperature (150 degrees C) PEMWE using H3PO4 doped polybenzimidazole membrane as an electrolyte and Pt black as cathode gives best performance for 90%RuO2-10%Ta2O5 electrocatalyst with current density of 1.1 A cm(-2) at 1.8 V. Moreover, 90%RuO2-10%Ta2O5 anode catalyst found to be more stable compared to RuO2 in 5 h operation of PEMWE at 150 degrees C. To gauge degradation process in PEMWE, anolyte and membrane electrode assembly are examined by fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS) after PEMWE operation.

Evaluation of the experimental data within the conventional Kok model [Kok, B., Forbush, B., and McGloin, M. (1970) Photochem. Photobiol. 11, 457-475] led to the following results: (1) the probability of the miss factor is strongly pH dependent (with a pronounced minimum near neutral pH) while the double hit factor is less affected; (2) a marked increase of the apparent S-0 population arises at alkaline pH in dark-adapted samples where most of the Y-D is reduced, but this effect is absent if the percentage of PS II containing the oxidized form Y-D(ox) is high; and (3) the lifetimes of S-2 and S-3 exhibit a characteristic pH dependence that is indicative of conformational changes of functional relevance within the water-oxidizing complex and its environment; (4) the kinetic interaction of redox states S-2 and S-3 With Y-D is characterized by a change of its behavior at a threshold pH of 6.5-7.0; and (5) at acidic pH values the extent of S-2 and S-3 reduction by Y-D decreases concomitant with the occurrence of a very fast decay kinetics. On the basis of a detailed discussion of these results and data from the literature, the water oxidase is inferred to undergo structural changes at pH values of 5-5.5 and 6.5-7.0. These transitions are almost independent of the redox state S-i and modify the reaction coordiates of the water oxidase toward endogenous reductants.									51	0	0	0	36	0	51			0006-2960			WOS:A1994PG02100008	8086406

The as-deposited and annealed thin films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) to determine their structural, morphological, compositional and electrochemical properties, respectively. The as-deposited nanostructured amorphous FeOOH thin film is converted into a polycrystalline Fe2O3 with hematite crystal structure at a high temperature. The FeOOH thin film acts as an efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline 1 M KOH electrolyte. The film annealed at 200 degrees C shows high catalytic activity with an onset overpotential of 240 mV with a smaller Tafel slope of 48 mV/dec. Additionally, it needs an overpotential of 290 mV to the drive the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and shows good stability in the 1 M KOH electrolyte solution.

So far, many earth-abundant co-catalysts can only play roles at a single pH (only in neutral or alkaline electrolyte), but the development of wide-pH compatible co-catalyst with low price are rarely obtained. Herein, amorphous MoSx layer was conformally coated on TiO2 nanowire arrays (NAs) as an active co-catalyst for multi-pH water photo -oxidation. The experimental results showed that the MoSx greatly enhanced the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of TiO2 NAs with high photocurrent densities of 1.95, 1.67, and 1.55 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 VRHE in acidic, alkaline, and neutral electrolyte, respectively, significantly higher than bare TiO2 and most TiO2/co-catalyst literature values. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the MoSx on TiO2 improves electronic interaction at their interface and forms a type-II band structure for more efficient separation of charge carriers. It is also found that high-density active sites provided by MoSx can reduce the Gibbs free energy and overpotential of potential-determining step for OER, which further enhance the adsorption activity of reaction intermediates. Our work contributes to the in-depth understanding of amorphous MoSx as efficient water oxidation co-catalyst for multi-pH PEC water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000830812300004

The sintered membranes were characterized via X-ray diffraction, back scattered electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction, and associated with image analysis and calculations to quantify phase compositions and microstructural features including volume fractions, grain sizes, and contiguity. The characterizations reveal a multi-phase system containing Ce1-xGdxO2-delta, (X approximate to 0.1) (CG010), and FeyCo3-yO4 (0.2 < y < 1.2) (KO), CoO and Gd0.85Ce0.15Fe0.75Co0.25O3 (GCFCO) in the sintered membranes. In addition, a novel model is utilized to assess the evolution of the ambipolar conductivity with respect to microstructural features. Both experimental and calculated results indicate that if the grain sizes of all phases in the composites are similar, the optimal ambipolar conductivity is reached with a volume ratio of ionic conducting phase to electronic conducting phase close to 4:1. Meanwhile, the GCFCO phase dominates the effective electronic conductivity.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0955-2219	1873-619X		WOS:000564729500001

Under aerobic conditions, the presence of yeasts reduced the production of colored products, the formation rate of which was similar to that observed under anaerobic conditions and in the absence of yeasts. These results reveal that yeasts and intermediate reaction products compete for oxygen. In the absence of oxygen, the production of colored compounds was even smaller in presence of yeasts, as a result of their ability to retain browning products as they form. Because the absence of oxygen not inhibited the formation of intermediate products resulting from oxidation reactions, an alternative oxidation pathway are proposed acting the glyoxylic acid as oxidant. In the usual concentrations of catechin in white wines, the studied reaction of (+)-catechin-glyoxylic acid can contribute significantly to the alteration of the wine color.									8	1	0	0	4	0	9			1438-2377	1438-2385		WOS:000235219500037

The designed 2D polymers possess indirect bandgaps in the range of 1.80-2.84 eV and show pronounced light absorption in the ultraviolet and visible region of the solar spectrum. With suitable band edge alignment, the examined N- and B-center polymers can generate sufficient photon-excited electrons and holes to activate the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively. The combination of lattice-inherent band features (flat bands) with chemical functionalization (potential shift due to heteroatoms) makes it possible to construct tandem cells with suppressed electron/hole recombination for effective overall water splitting. In addition, there is a potential difference between the half-electrodes that can be utlized to power auxiliary components in self-sufficient photocatalyzers.									31	0	0	0	0	0	31			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000646515200001	33942398

In this work, Co0.7Fe0.3 alloy nanoparticles (NPs) confined in N-doped carbon with a yolk-shell structure in multi-beaded fibers were prepared as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. The confinement structure was composed of an N-doped graphitized carbon shell and a core formed by numerous Co0.7Fe0.3 NPs, and was evenly threaded into a one-dimensional fiber. Moreover, this distinctive hierarchical structure featured abundant mesopores, a high BET surface area of 743.8 m(2) g(-1), good electronic conductivity, and uniformly distributed Co0.7Fe0.3/Co(Fe)-N-x coupling active sites. Therefore, the experimentally optimized Co0.7Fe0.3@NC2:1-800 showed excellent OER performance (overpotential reached 314 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) that far exceeded RuO2 (353 mV), and good ORR catalytic performance (half-wave potential of 0.827 V) comparable to Pt/C (0.818 V). Impressively, the Co0.7Fe0.3@NC2:1-800 Zn-air battery delivered a higher open circuit voltage of 1.449 V, large power density of 85.7 mW cm(-2), and outstanding charge-discharge cycling stability compared with the commercial RuO2 + 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst. This work provides new ideas for the structural design of electrocatalysts and energy conversion systems.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000614867500041	33491021

We observed the nearby oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch star IK Tau using the high-resolution HIFI spectrometer onboard Herschel. We report on the first detection of (H2O)-O-16 and the rarer isotopologues (H2O)-O-17 and (H2O)-O-18 in both the ortho and para states. We deduce a total water content (relative to molecular hydrogen) of 6.6 x 10(-5), and an ortho-to-para ratio of 3:1. These results are consistent with the formation of H2O in thermodynamical chemical equilibrium at photospheric temperatures, and does not require pulsationally induced non-equilibrium chemistry, vaporization of icy bodies or grain surface reactions. High-excitation lines of (CO)-C-12, (CO)-C-13, (SiO)-Si-28, (SiO)-Si-29, (SiO)-Si-30, HCN, and SO have also been detected. From the observed line widths, the acceleration region in the inner wind zone can be characterized, and we show that the wind acceleration is slower than hitherto anticipated.									47	0	0	0	0	0	47			0004-6361			WOS:000284150900004

However, their conventional enclosed non -/polycrystalline walls pose huge obstacles for rapid loading and mass diffusion. Here, we present a new single-crystal capsular-MOF with openings on the wall, which is carefully designed at the molecular level and constructed from a crystal-structure transformation. This rare open-capsule MOF can easily load the largest amounts of sulfur and iodine among known MOFs. In addition, derived from capsular-MOF and melamine through pyrolysis-phosphidation, we fabricated a nitrogen-doped capsular carbon-based framework with iron-nickel phosphide nanoparticles immobilized on capsular carbons interconnected by plentiful carbon nanotubes. Benefiting from synergistic effects between the carbon framework and highly surface-exposed phosphide sites, the material exhibits efficient multifunctional electrocatalysis for oxygen evolution, hydrogen evolution, and oxygen reduction, achieving well-qualified assemblies of an overall water splitting (low potential of 1.59 V at 10 mA.cm(-2)) and a rechargeable Zn-air battery (high peak power density of 250 mW.cm(-2) and excellent stability for 500 h), which afford remarkably practical prospects over previously known electrocatalysts.									112	6	1	0	11	0	113			0002-7863			WOS:000468366900034	31042369

Herein, nanocomposites based on Co/Co2P nanoparticles encapsulated within hierarchically porous N, P, S co-doped carbon are prepared by controlled pyrolysis of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-67) and poly(cyclotriphosphazene-co-4,4'-sulfonyldiphenol) (PZS). The resulting Co/Co2P@NPSC nanocomposites exhibit apparent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance, and are used as the reversible oxygen catalyst for zinc-air batteries (ZABs). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations exhibit that Co2P could provide active sites for the ORR and promote the conversion between the adsorbed intermediates, and porous N,P,S co-doped carbon with Co2P nanoparticles also improves the exposure of actives sites and endows charge transport. Liquid-state ZABs with Co/Co2P@NPSC as the cathode catalysts demonstrate the greater power density of 198.1 mW cm(-2) and a long cycling life of 50 h at 10 mA cm(-2), likely due to the encapsulation of Co/Co2P nanoparticles by the carbon shell. Solid-state ZABs also display a remarkable performance with a high peak power density of 74.3 mW cm(-2). Therefore, this study indicates the meaning of the design and engineering of hierarchical porous carbon nanomaterial as electrocatalyst for rechargeable metal-air batteries.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2196-0216			WOS:000722862100018		
J	Davies, J. Huw				Davies, J./C-6143-2009	Davies, Huw/0000-0003-2656-0260			Did a mega-collision dry Venus' interior?								EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS				268	3-4			376	383		10.1016/j.epsl.2008.01.031				APR 30 2008	2008	The limited relaxation of shapes of impact craters and high correlation between topography and gravity are some of the reasons that support the widely accepted view that the interior of Venus is dry compared to Earth. The fact that the atmospheric abundance of Ar-40 is only similar to 25% of the radiogenic gas produced inside Venus argues that Venus is not thoroughly degassed and its interior has not been dried over time. Therefore Venus must have lost its water very early in its history, before any significant Ar-40 was produced. Current ideas suggest that Venus did not suffer a major impact. Therefore one would not expect it to have been substantially molten. As a result degassing all its water would be difficult and losing all the water without leaving oxygen in the atmosphere would also be very difficult.To overcome the above difficulties in explaining a dry Venus interior, a new hypothesis is proposed that Venus formed by a near head-on collision of two large planetary embryos, as might be expected from favoured oligarchic planetary accretion. Such a collision would be sufficiently large to melt totally and briefly vapourise a significant proportion of both bodies. This would allow much of the released water to react rapidly with iron. Depending upon the reaction hydrogen is either expected to escape to space or enter the core. Oxygen would form FeO, most of which would enter the core, together with other iron reaction products. Most everything else not caught in the hydrodynamic escape driven by any hydrogen stream would be gravitationally retained by the final body. The model can therefore reconcile the Ar-40 data, a virtually oxygen free atmosphere and a dry interior. An appropriate large collision also provides an easy explanation for the retrograde rotation of Venus. The possible implications for inner core and magnetic field formation; and atmosphere evolution including effects on D/H, C, N and inert gases are also discussed. A simple test of this hypothesis is that, in contrast to the current Venus paradigm, little or no hydrated minerals should be found on the surface. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Hydrogen production from the water-splitting process by hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a promising approach, but it needs commercially expensive Pt-based electrocatalysts. Hence, designing nonnoble-metal catalysts for this reaction with both great activity and robust stability has remained a crucial challenge in the past decades. In the present study, platinum (Pt), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), manganese (Mn), and copper (Cu) metals are uniformly considered on N-doped carbon (NC) nanosheet derived from zeolitic imidazolate metal-organic framework (ZIF), and the capability of proposed nanomaterials is theoretically investigated by density functional theory (DFT) for HER process. As expected, results indicate Pt/NC has a high ability for HER process. Besides, it was shown that energy barriers in the HER process catalyzed by Ni and Co /NC electrocatalysts were close to zero representing their great HER activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000696035400001

Morphological Stability of Copper Surfaces under Reducing Conditions								ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES				13	41			48730	48744		10.1021/acsami.1c13989		OCT 2021		OCT 20 2021	2021	Though copper is a capable electrocatalyst for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), it rapidly deactivates to produce mostly hydrogen. A current hypothesis as to why this occurs is that potential-induced morphological restructuring takes place, leading to a redistribution of the facets at the interface resulting in a shift in the catalytic activity to favor the hydrogen evolution reaction over CO2RR. Here, we investigate the veracity of this hypothesis by studying the changes in the voltammetry of various copper surfaces, specifically the three principal orientations and a polycrystalline surface, after being subjected to strongly cathodic conditions. The basal planes were chosen as model catalysts, while polycrystalline copper was included as a means of investigating the overall behavior of defect-rich facets with many low coordination steps and kink sites. We found that all surfaces exhibited (perhaps surprisingly) high stability when subjected to strongly cathodic potentials in a concentrated alkaline electrolyte (10 M NaOH). Proof for morphological stability under CO2RR-representative conditions (60 min at -0.75 V in 0.5 M KHCO3) was obtained from identical location scanning electron microscopy, where the mesoscopic morphology for a nanoparticle-covered copper surface was found unchanged to within the instrument accuracy. Observed changes in voltammetry under such conditions, we found, were not indicative of a redistribution of surface sites but of electrode fouling. Besides impurities, we show that (brief) exposure to oxygen or oxidizing conditions (i.e., 1 min) leads to copper exhibiting changing morphology upon cathodic treatment which, we posit, is ultimately the reason why many groups report the evolution of copper morphology during CO2RR: accidental oxidation/reduction cycles.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000710924900038	34612038

Herein, we systematically study the architecture transition and crystal facet engineering at the atomic level on the surface of sub-5 nm Pd(111) tetrahedrons (Ths), aimed at embodying how the variations in the local facet and shape of a sub-10 nm core-shell structure affect its surface geometrical properties and electronic structures. Specifically, surface atomic replication is predominant when the shell metal deposits less than five atomic layers, thus forming a series of Pd@M (M = Pt, Ru, and Rh) core-shell Ths enclosed by (111) facets (6.8 nm), while over five atomic layers, spontaneous facets tropism of each metal is predominant, where Pt atoms still follow fcc-(111) packing, Ru atoms select hcp-phase stacking, and Rh atoms choose fcc-(100) crystallization, respectively. In particular, Pt atoms take a seamless geometrical transformation from Pd@Pt Ths into Pd@Pt truncated octahedrons (TOhs, similar to 7.6 nm). As a proof-of-concept application, such sub-10 nm core-shell architectures with Pt skin show a component-dependent relationship toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), where the catalytic activity follows the order of Pd@Pt(111) TOhs (E-1/2 = 0.916 V, 1.632 A mg(Pt)(-1)) > Pd@Pt(111) Ths > Pt black. Meanwhile the Ru skin show a facet-dependent relationship toward acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) where the catalytic activity follows the order of Pd@Ru(111) Ths > Pd@Ru(hcp) Ths > Pd Ths.									18	0	0	0	3	0	17			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000634569100126	33588529

Nevertheless, the PEC capability of BiVO4 photoelectrodes is restricted by the short carrier diffusion length, undesirable electron transport ability, and slow oxygen evolution rate. To overcome these shortcomings, we design and fabricate a novel ternary hybrid composite of 3D Co-Pi/BiVO4/SnO2 nanosheet array (NSA) photoanodes. Benefiting from the high light-harvesting ability of NSAs, for the BiVO4/SnO2 heterojunction, and fast water oxidation rate of Co-Pi, effective separation of electron hole pairs the hybrid system exhibited 20.2-times enhancement in photocurrent and a significant cathodic shift about the onset potential of water oxidation reaction compared with single BiVO4. Coupled with the Au nanoparticle cathode, the PEC cell exhibited a 90.0% faradaic efficiency for CO, reduction under a small applied voltage of 1.10 V and saved more than 50% of electric energy compared to the general electrochemical cell. We believe that the fabricated 3D Co-Pi/BiVO4/SnO2 NSAs with remarkably enhanced PEC performance could provide clean power for the modern society via reduction reaction on pollution gases.									18	2	0	0	0	0	19			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000477787200041	31245987

The structural characterizations confirmed the formation of Co-N bonds and the close electron coupling between Co-g-C3N4 and graphene sheets. The electrocatalytic measurements demonstrated Co-g-C3N4-catalyzed reduction of oxygen mainly in a four electron pathway. The improvement of ORR activity is closely related to the abundant accessible Co-N-x active sites and fast charge transfer at the interfaces of Co-g-C3N4/graphene. Also, Co-g-C3N4@graphene exhibited comparable ORR activity, better durability, and methanol tolerance ability in comparison to Pt/C, and bodes well for a promising non-noble cathode catalyst for the application of direct methanol fuel cells. The chemical doping strategy in this work would be helpful to improve other present catalysts for fuel cell applications.									334	26	0	0	35	0	348			0743-7463			WOS:000316168400036	23425296

However, a brisk recombination of light-induced electron-hole (e(-)-h(+)) pairs in the bulk g-C3N4 effectuate poor quantum efficiency in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The shuttle redox mediator manifests ample potential in accelerating photo-induced carrier segregation and in boosting charge transport in the HER. Here, we report that exploiting Ag/Ag(I) and Fe(III)/Fe(II) shuttle redox mediators, the hydrogen-evolving rate of the aforementioned g-C3N4 nanosheets can reach 3213.3 mmol g(-1) h(-1) under visible-light irradiation, which is eight times higher than that of pure g-C3N4 (404.82 mmol g(-1) h(-1)). The effective coupling between a hydrogen-evolving catalyst and appropriate shuttle redox mediators significantly improves the HER-photocatalytic performance of native g-C3N4 nanosheets. Density functional theory calculations show that the presence of Ag/Ag(I) and Fe(III)/Fe(II) shuttle redox mediators can effectively promote H atom adsorption and facilitate a H2O reduction reaction. This work envisages a new and deft approach for contriving high-performance g-C3N4-based photocatalysts for highly efficient solar-to-fuel conversion. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study explores the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of nickel (Ni) nanoparticles and nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (NiNCNTs), which are fabricated by a cheap and one-step pyrolysis method. The most active catalyst synthesized at 800 degrees C exhibits an overpotential of 0.244 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), Tafel slope of 93.3 mV dec(-1) and a satisfactory 10 hours stability. Low resistance and large ECSA value of the sample also favor the competent response for HER in alkaline media. The robust HER activity of the catalyst is as a result of the nickel nanoparticles which are the active spots of reaction; while the presence of well-developed nitrogen containing carbon nanotubes with large content of pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen may provide high-electron density and feasible routes for its transportation to deliver an outstanding HER performance.									15	1	0	0	0	0	16			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000536410700001

We have performed experiments in the pressure range from 10(-8) to 10(-3) mbar, exposing the surface to large gas doses at room temperature. We show the co-existence of two active paths: one involves the complete dehydrogenation of methanol into CO, the other one promotes the scission of the C-O bond of methanol, leaving carbon and oxygen on the surface, which, after large exposures, deactivate the surface towards a further evolution of the molecular adlayer. In no case, the presence of stable reaction intermediates is detected along either of the two reaction paths. We have compared the behavior of flat ruthenium surfaces with those having a variable concentration of controlled surface defects. Surface defects, mainly steps, seem to accelerate the rate of both reaction paths, but do not activate any new reaction path or stabilize intermediates. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Pristine MWCNT was acid treated to induce the number of oxygen functional groups on the surface and enhances the wettability. Thereafter, Pt nanoparticles (Pt Nps) were deposited by a simple electrodeposition technique on the oxygen enriched MWCNT surface. The Pt NIs@f-MWCNT has been physicochemically characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The TEM analysis showed the presence of Pt NIs on MWCNT wherein, the NIs were made up of small Pt nanoclusters of similar to 4 nm in dimension. The electrochemical HER studies were carried out using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), Tafel polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). An overpotential (eta) of-84 mV was obtained at a current density (j) of-10 mA/cm(2). The amount of Pt loading has been optimized through electrodeposition. Enhanced HER activity was observed with a Pt loading of 3.8 ug/ cm2. In order to ascertain the durability of the catalyst, accelerated degradation test (ADT) was carried out for 10,000 cycles at a scan rate (u) of 100 mV/s. The turnover frequency (TOF) was estimated to be 6.3 s(-1) at q =-70 mV. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published									14	1	0	0	1	0	15			0360-3199	1879-3487		WOS:000402587500050

The development of energy conversion technologies based on these renewable catalysts has been hindered by their extreme oxygen sensitivity. Attempts to improve the enzymes by directed evolution have failed for want of a screening platform capable of throughputs high enough to adequately sample heavily mutated DNA libraries. In vitro compartmentalization (IVC) is a powerful method capable of screening for multiple-turnover enzymatic activity at very high throughputs. Recent advances have allowed [FeFe] hydrogenases to be expressed and activated in the cell-free protein synthesis reactions on which IVC is based; however, IVC is a demanding technique with which many enzymes have proven incompatible.Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we describe an extremely high-throughput IVC screen for oxygen-tolerant [FeFe] hydrogenases. We demonstrate that the [FeFe] hydrogenase CpI can be expressed and activated within emulsion droplets, and identify a fluorogenic substrate that links activity after oxygen exposure to the generation of a fluorescent signal. We present a screening protocol in which attachment of mutant genes and the proteins they encode to the surfaces of microbeads is followed by three separate emulsion steps for amplification, expression, and evaluation of hydrogenase mutants. We show that beads displaying active hydrogenase can be isolated by fluorescence-activated cell-sorting, and we use the method to enrich such beads from a mock library.Conclusions/Significance: [FeFe] hydrogenases are the most complex enzymes to be produced by cell-free protein synthesis, and the most challenging targets to which IVC has yet been applied. The technique described here is an enabling step towards the development of biocatalysts for a biological hydrogen economy.									51	2	0	0	35	0	53			1932-6203			WOS:000284995300026	21151915

In order to explain how oxide nanoparticles are formed in the consolidation process, the powders after oxidation are subjected to vacuum thermal treatment at high temperatures. Differential scanning calorimeter, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy techniques are used to detect the generation, evolution of oxides on both the surface and interior of the powder, as well as the type of oxide nanoparticles in the fabricated ODS alloy. It is found that an iron oxide layer is formed on the surface of the powder during low temperature oxidation. And the iron oxide layer would be decomposed after thermal treatment at high temperature. In the consolidation process, the oxygen required by the reaction of alumina and yttrium oxide to produce nanoscale Y-Al-O particles mainly derives from the decomposition of iron oxide layer at elevated temperature and the inward diffusion of oxygen. Using the direct oxidation process, YAlO3 nanoparticles are dispersed in the grains and at the grain boundaries of Fe-Cr-Al ODS alloy.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1006-7191	2194-1289		WOS:000607045300001

The average diameters of Au NPs on carbon support were in the range from 5.8 (+/- 2.4) to 2.0 (+/- 0.4) nm, with 50 particles quantified. Electrocatalytic activities of as-prepared Au NPs/CB were explored for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in basic solution with rotating disk electrode (RDE) and rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) voltammetry. In results, the Au NPs/CB synthesized with 0.2 mM NaBH4 (2.0 nm of Au NPs diameter) represented the highest ORR catalytic activity with electron transfer number of 3.9 and mass activity of 0.25 mA cm(-2) mu g(-1)as well as a perfect resistance to methanol contamination. Especially, the half-wave potential of ORR curve which related to the kinetics of oxygen reduction was more positive compared with previously reported Au-based ORR catalysts. In addition, the Au NPs/CB prepared with 0.2 mM NaBH4 was also examined as a CO2 reduction catalyst in KHCO3 with KCl solution with scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). CO2 was reduced to CO selectively without hydrogen evolution at Au NPs/CB substrate electrode, which was directly monitored with an electrochemical CO microsensor as a tip electrode in SECM. In addition, we have identified the products of CO2 reduction through gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry (MS), flame ionization detector (FID), and thermal conductivity detector (TCD).									9	1	0	0	1	0	9			1040-0397	1521-4109		WOS:000453612300005

In standard models, H and O escape in a stoichiometric 2:1 ratio because H reaches the upper atmosphere via long-lived molecular hydrogen, whose abundance is regulated by a photochemical feedback sensitive to atmospheric oxygen content. The relatively constant escape rates these models predict are inconsistent with known H escape variations of more than an order of magnitude on seasonal timescales, variation that requires escaping H to have a source other than H-2. The best candidate source is high-altitude water, detected by the Mars Express spacecraft in seasonally variable concentrations. Here we use a one-dimensional time-dependent photochemical model to show that the introduction of high-altitude water can produce a large increase in the H escape rate on a timescale of weeks, quantitatively linking these observations. This H escape pathway produces prompt H loss that is not immediately balanced by O escape, influencing the oxidation state of the atmosphere for millions of years. Martian atmospheric water loss may be dominated by escape via this pathway, which may therefore potentially control the planet's atmospheric chemistry. Our findings highlight the influence that seasonal atmospheric variability can have on planetary evolution.									79	3	0	0	1	0	79			1752-0894	1752-0908		WOS:000395791400007

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations can, in principle, provide a reliable description of such interfaces, but the high computational costs severely restrict the accessible time and length scales. Here, we report machine learning-driven simulations of various interfaces between water and lithium manganese oxide (LixMn2O4), an important electrode material in lithium ion batteries and a catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction. We employ a high-dimensional neural network potential to compute the energies and forces several orders of magnitude faster than DFT without loss in accuracy. In addition, a high-dimensional neural network for spin prediction is utilized to analyze the electronic structure of the manganese ions. Combining these methods, a series of interfaces is investigated by large-scale molecular dynamics. The simulations allow us to gain insights into a variety of properties, such as the dissociation of water molecules, proton transfer processes, and hydrogen bonds, as well as the geometric and electronic structure of the solid surfaces, including the manganese oxidation state distribution, Jahn-Teller distortions, and electron hopping.

A total of 151 metabolites were involved in our proposed metabolic network, which consisted of 132 chemical reactions that describe the reaction pathways, and include 25 reactions describing N-glycosylation and additional reactions for the accumulation of the produced glycoforms. Additional eight reactions are considered for accumulation of the N-glycosylation products in the extracellular environment and one reaction to correlate cell degradation. The following pathways were considered: glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, nucleotide synthesis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, lipid synthesis, protein synthesis, biomass production, anaplerotic reactions, and membrane transport.

The Ni MOF exhibits 346 mV overpotential (eta) at a current density of 10 mAcm(-2), 79.03 Ag-1 specific-mass activity at 400 mV of eta than compared to wet chemically prepared (WCP) NiO and RuO2 for OER in 1 M KOH. Meanwhile, approximate to 230 mV of at 10 mAcm(-2) current density with appreciable stability for 12 hours for Ni MOF in 30% KOH was also observed. For UOR in UE, Ni MOF shows an onset potential of 1.34 V vs. RHE and 63.15 mAcm(-2) current density at 1.5 V vs RHE in 1 M KOH in the presence of 1 M urea. The observed results of OER and UOR catalytic behavior are better than wet chemically prepared (WCP) NiO and noble benchmark RuO2 catalyst under identical conditions. The results suggested that the MOF plays a major role in enhancing the catalytic activity by the facile formation of Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH, stability and electronic properties due to their porous and interconnected structure.									63	2	0	0	2	0	63			2196-0216			WOS:000446066100013

Despite extensive success on H-2 production on polymer photocatalysts, polymers have met with very limited success for the rate-determining step of the water splitting-water oxidation reaction due to the extremely slow "four-hole" chemistry. Here, the synthesized metal-free oxygenated covalent triazine (OCT) is remarkably active for oxygen production in a wide operation window from UV to visible and even to NIR (up to 800 nm), neatly matching the solar spectrum with an unprecedented external quantum efficiency (even 1% at 600 nm) apart from excellent activity for H-2 production under full arc irradiation, a big step moving toward full solar spectrum water splitting. Experimental results and DFT calculations show that the oxygen incorporation not only narrows the band gap but also causes appropriate band-edge shifts. In the end, a controlled small amount of oxygen in the ionothermal reaction is found to be a promising and facile way of achieving such oxygen incorporation. This discovery is a significant step toward both scientific understanding and practical development of metal-free photocatalysts for cost-effective water oxidation and hydrogen generation over a large spectral window.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2574-0962			WOS:000576676900089	33015589

Here, earth -abundant CoxNi1-xO nanowire arrays were used as a structural framework to dilute Ir incorporation for fabricating electrocatalysts for water splitting. Minimal Ir-incorporated CoxNi1-xO nanowire arrays were synthesized through the facile hydrothermal method with subsequent calcination by using Ni foam (NF) as both the substrate and source of Ni. The electrocatalytic water-splitting performance was found to crucially depend on the Ir content of the parent CoxNi1-xO nanowire arrays. As a result, for a minimal Ir content, as low as 0.57 wt%, the obtained Ir-CoxNi1-xO/NF electrodes exhibited optimal catalytic activity in terms of a low overpotential of 260 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction and 53 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 mol L-1 KOH. When used as bifunctional electrodes in water splitting, the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) was obtained at a low cell voltage of 1.55 V. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the Ir-doped CoxNil.xO arrays exhibited enhanced electrical conductivity and low Gibbs free energy, which contributed to the improved electrocatalytic activity. The present study presents a new strategy for the development of transition metal oxide electrocatalysts with low levels of Ir incorporation for efficient water splitting.

J	Zhang, LP; Patel, HN; Lappe, JW; Wachter, RM								Reaction progress of chromophore biogenesis in green fluorescent protein								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY				128	14			4766	4772		10.1021/ja0580439				APR 12 2006	2006	The mature form of green fluorescent protein (GFP) is generated by a spontaneous self-modification process that is essentially irreversible. A key step in chromophore biosynthesis involves slow air oxidation of an intermediate species, in which the backbone atoms of residues 65-67 have condensed to form a five-membered heterocycle. We have investigated the kinetics of hydrogen peroxide evolution during in vitro GFP maturation and found that the H2O2 coproduct is generated prior to the acquisition of green fluorescence at a stoichiometry of 1:1 (peroxide/chromophore). The experimental progress curves were computer-fitted to a three-step mechanism, in which the first step proceeds with a time constant of 1.5 (+/- 1.1) min and includes protein folding and peptide cyclization. Kinetic data obtained by HPLC analysis support a rapid cyclization reaction that can be reversed upon acid denaturation. The second step proceeds with a time constant of 34.0 (+/- 1.5) min and entails rate-limiting protein oxidation, as supported by a mass loss of 2 Da observed for tryptic peptides derived from species that accumulate during the reaction. The final step in GFP maturation proceeds with a time constant of 10.6 (+/- 1.2) min, suggesting that this step may contribute to overall rate retardation. We propose that under highly aerobic conditions, the dominant reaction path follows a cyclization-oxidation-dehydration mechanism, in which dehydration of the heterocycle is facilitated by slow proton abstraction from the Tyr66 beta-carbon. In combination, the results presented here suggest a role for molecular oxygen in trapping the cyclized form of GFP.									87	1	1	0	46	0	90			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000236770300067	16594713

Herein, we report an arc discharge strategy coupled with an controllable oxidation to prepare Co/Co3O4 nanoparticles confined in ultrathin O-doped graphitic carbon layer (Co/Co3O4 @ODGC) as highly active bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for Zn-air batteries (ZABs). The resultant Co/Co3O4 @ODGC shows an impressive ORR performance with a half-wave potential of 0.80 V in 0.1 M KOH. It also exhibits remarkable OER performance with a small overpotential of 300 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Both experimental studies and theoretical calculations indicate that the high ORR and OER activities are attributed to the synergistic electronic effect between the Co/Co3O4 hetemstructures and ultrathin O-doped graphitic layer (similar to 1.5 nm). Particularly, the electron redistribution in graphitic layer caused by O-doping and carbon defects significantly decreases the energy barrier for oxygen adsorption/desorption. More attractively, the as-constructed ZABs with Co/Co3O4@ODGC cathode show an impressive open voltage (1.60 V), a high power density of 107 mW cm(-2), and good stability without nearly no performance decay for 40 h at 2.0 mA cm(-2). This work provides both fundamental understanding and easy strategy for developing the efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for high performance metal-air batteries.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000711828700004

However, activation of the alpha-C-H bond of ethylbenzene by use of photocatalysis-generated superoxide anions (O-2(center dot-)) remains a challenge. Herein, the formation of individual Fe atoms on polymeric carbon nitride (CN), that activates O-2 to create O-2(center dot-) for facilitating the reaction of ethylbenzene to form acetophenone, is demonstrated. By utilizing density functional theory and materials characterization techniques, it is shown that individual Fe atoms are coordinated to four N atoms of CN and the resultant low-spin Fe-N-4 system (t(2g)(6)e(g)(0)) is not only a great adsorption site for oxygen molecules, but also allows for fast transfer of electrons generated in the CN framework to adsorbed O-2, producing O-2(center dot-). The oxidation reaction of ethylbenzene triggered by O-2(center dot-) ions turns out to have a high conversion rate of 99% as well as an acetophenone selectivity of 99%, which can be ascribed to a novel reaction pathway that is different from the conventional route involving hydroxyl radicals and the production of phenethyl alcohol. Furthermore, it possesses great potential for other C-H activation reactions besides ethylbenzene oxidation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000804999200001	35543386

The model is applied to investigate mechanisms associated with oxygen recombination and species transport during charge. The conditions for rapid transport rates of gaseous oxygen through the separator and dissolved oxygen through the liquid film within the Pb electrode are considered, and these rates are rapid for the conditions investigated. Model predictions show that during charge gas volume increases in the Pb electrode and decreases in the PbO2 electrode. At the onset of oxygen recombination during constant-current charge, the polarization of the Pb electrode is reduced, which results in the prediction of a maximum in cell voltage. This voltage behavior is demonstrated experimentally. The prediction of a voltage maximum by the mathematical model occurs when the recombination mechanism is the direct electrochemical reduction of oxygen at the Pb electrode. Model simulation with another recombination mechanism in which oxygen reacts chemically with lead to form lead sulfate does ndt produce a voltage maximum. A decrease in the amount of gas space surrounding the cell results in predictions of increased Pb-electrode depolarization.									68	0	0	0	0	0	68			0013-4651			WOS:A1995RN05300025

Online and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was utilized to monitor the radiation-induced chemical processing of these ices. Along with isocyanic acid (HNCO), the products could be mainly derived from those formed in irradiated binary ices of the N-2-CH4 and CO-CH4 systems: nitrogen-bearing products were found in the form of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), hydrogen isocyanide (HNC), diazomethane (CH2N2), and its radical fragment (HCN2); oxygen-bearing products were of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), formyl radical (HCO), and formaldehyde (H2CO). As in the pure ices, the methyl radical (CH3) and ethane (C2H6) were also detected, as were carbon dioxide (CO2) and the azide radical (N-3). Based on the temporal evolution of the newly formed products, kinetic reaction schemes were then developed to fit the temporal profiles of the newly formed species, resulting in numerical sets of rate constants. The current study highlights important constraints on the preferential formation of isocyanic acid (HNCO) over hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and hydrogen isocyanide (HNC), thus guiding the astrobiological and chemical evolution of those distant bodies.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000309520500037

Fatty acid desaturases are responsible for the insertion of double bonds into pre-formed fatty acid chains in reactions that require oxygen and reducing equivalents. In this study, the genome-wide characterization of the fatty acid desaturases from seven eukaryotic photosynthetic microalgae was undertaken according to the conserved histidine-rich motifs and phylogenetic profiles. Analysis of these genomes provided insight into the origin and evolution of the pathway of fatty acid biosynthesis in eukaryotic plants.

Herein, a V-doping triggered self-assembly strategy is reported to synthesize dendritic V-Ni3S2@NiO coreshell nanoarrays on nickel foam (V-Ni3S2@NiO/NF), which consist of an ultrathin V-doped NiO nanoshell (2-7 nm) and high-crystalline Ni3S2 core. The unique hierarchical structure offers multidimensional mass and charge transport channels and plentiful catalytically active sites for water splitting reactions, resulting in improved water electrolysis kinetics. More importantly, benefiting from the rapid anodic oxidation and evolution process due to the partial leaching of vanadium(IV) in the V-Ni3S2@ NiO/NF material, the highly active amorphous NiOOH phase is immediately generated on the surface of V-Ni3S2@NiO/NF (V-Ni3S2@ NiO/NiOOH/NF), which contributes to enhancing the adsorption of OH- and exposing abundant unsaturated active sites and thus remarkably enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics in basic electrolyte. Moreover, an alkaline electrolyzer assembled by V-Ni3S2@NiO/NF simultaneously functioning as both anode and cathode only needs an extremely small voltage of 1.52 V to yield 10 mA cm(-2) and retains this activity for over 55 h. This work provides a new train of thought and tactics for the development of high-efficiency electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									36	0	0	0	0	0	36			2168-0485			WOS:000529151600007

The PdNN has been synthesized by the simple chemical route with the assistance of zinc precursor and a surfactant (i.e., cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, CTAB). The thickness of the network can be tuned by simply adjusting the concentration of CTAB. Both EOR and HER have been performed in an alkaline electrolyte, and characterized by different voltammetric methods. The 3D PdNN has shown 2.2-fold higher electrochemical surface area than the commercially available Pt/C including other tested catalysts with minimal Pd loading. As a result, it provides a higher density of EOR and HER active sites and facilitated the electron transport. For example, it shows 2.6-fold higher mass activity with significantly lower CO2 production for EOR and the similar overpotential (110 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2)) for HER compared to Pt/C with better reaction kinetics for both reactions. Thus, the PdNN is proved as an efficient electrocatalyst with better electrocatalytic activity and stability than state-of-the-art Pt/C for both EOR and HER because of the crystalline, monodispersed, and support-free porous nanonetwork.									53	2	0	0	3	0	54			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000416203800019	29068660

For the first time, we demonstrated influence of the N-CP type, like a nitrogen precursor, on activity toward HER of Co-N-C composites in acidic media, which may be related, in particular, to the differences in the molecular structure of polymers. It was found, that the best HER performance inherent to an electrocatalyst obtained based on poly-5-aminoindole (overpotential at 5 mA/cm(2) similar to 177 mV, Tafel slope - 132 mV/dec).

Through X-ray diffraction (XRD) refinements, La3+ is doped into Co3O4 lattice, which decreases the crystallinity of Co3O4. It inhibits the aggregation and growth of Co3O4 grains. 2%La-Co3O4-350 is the optimized sample to show the lowest overpotential of 98 mV at 10 mA cm(-2 )with the corresponding Tafel slope of 72.8 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH. Although La is an inactive rare-earth metal element for HER, it enhances the HER activity of Co3O4 efficiently. From further studies, the high HER catalytic activity of 2%La-Co3O4-350 can be owing to three aspects: (i) The highly dispersed and small-size Co3O4 nanoparticles caused by La doping own high specific surface area and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), which benefits exposing more Co3+ active sites to electrolyte. (ii) La dopants make 2%La-Co3O4-350 own more oxygen vacancies that facilitating the water dissociation step of HER. (iii) La doping leads to improved conductivity and charge transfer efficiency of 2%La-Co3O4-350 during HER. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The heteroatom-doped carbon materials loaded with non-precious metal compound is considered to be a promising alternative for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, Mo2C and MoS2 nanoparticles with a size of 5 similar to 20 nm uniformly loaded on the N/S-co-doped carbon sheets (NSC) are prepared via direct pyrolysis of ginkgo leaves with ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate (AMT). Carbon black (CB) is used to replace ginkgo leaves to obtain Mo2C@NC3 to further study the influence of N/S-containing organic components in ginkgo leaves. By comparing with Mo2C@NC3, the XPS reflect the characteristic peak of Mo is positively shifted while the characteristic peak of N 1 s is obviously negatively shifted, indicating a stronger electron interactions of Mo2C & MoS2@NSC3. Benefited from the intense electronics transfer, the efficiency electrochemical active areas of Mo2C & MoS2@NSC3 is larger than Mo2C@NC3 (10.72 vs. 4.97 mF/cm(-2)), thus the Mo2C & MoS2@NSC3 gives a smaller overpotential of 209 mV to obtain the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), together with a low Tafel slope value of 85.5 mV dec(-1).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000783195100001

As-prepared Sm2O3-Ni-Co vertical nanosheets interweave together into a honeycomb morphology and uniformly cover the entire surface of Ni foam. The influence of content of Sm2O3 in electroplating bath on the electrocatalytic performances of Sm2O3-Ni-Co/NF electrode towards HER is studied in 1.0M KOH electrolyte. Polarization curve indicates that the self-supported Sm2O3-Ni-Co/NF electrode exhibits remarkably enhanced electrocatalytic activity towards HER. To attain a current density of 10mAcm(-2), Sm2O3-Ni-Co/NF electrode needs lower overpotential (276mV) than Ni-Co/NF electrode (301 mV). In addition, Sm2O3-Ni-Co/NF electrode exhibits a lower Tafel slope, demonstrating more favorable HER kinetics. Sm2O3-Ni-Co/NF electrode has smaller charge transfer resistance than Ni-Co/NF electrode, indicating a faster Faradic process and better HER kinetics. Besides, Sm2O3-Ni-Co/NF electrode features satisfactory long-term durability in alkaline media. The results indicate that Sm2O3-Ni-Co/NF electrode has potential application to water splitting devices for hydrogen generation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Noguchi, Takumi				Noguchi, Takumi/I-7105-2014				FTIR detection of water reactions in the oxygen-evolving centre of photosystem II								PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				363	1494			1189	1194		10.1098/rstb.2007.2214				MAR 27 2008	2008	Flash-induced Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectroscopy has been used to study the water-oxidizing reactions in the oxygen-evolving centre of photosystem II. Reactions of water molecules were directly monitored by detecting the OH stretching bands of weakly H-bonded OH of water in the 3700-3500 cm(-1) region in FTIR difference spectra during S-state cycling. In the S-1 -> S-2 transition, a band shift from 3588 to 3617 cm(-1) was observed, indicative of a weakened H-bond. Decoupling experiments using D2O : H2O (1 : 1) showed that this OH arose from a water molecule with an asymmetric H-bonding structure and this asymmetry became more significant upon S-2 formation. In the S-2 -> S-3, S-3 -> S-0 and S-0 -> S-1 transitions, negative bands were observed at 3634, 3621 and 3612 cm(-1), respectively, representing formation of a strong H-bond or a proton release reaction. In addition, using complex spectral features in the carboxylate stretching region (1600-1300 cm(-1)) as 'fingerprints' of individual S-state transitions, pH dependency of the transition efficiencies and the effect of dehydration were examined to obtain the information of proton release and water insertion steps in the S-state cycle. Low-pH inhibition of the S-2 -> S-3, S-3 -> S-0 and S-0 -> S-1 transitions was consistent with a view that protons are released in the three transitions other than S-1 -> S-2, while relatively high susceptibility to dehydration in the S-2 -> S-3 and S-3 -> S-0 transitions suggested the insertion of substrate water into the system during these transitions. Thus, a possible mechanism of water oxidation to explain the FTIR data is proposed.									118	0	1	0	55	1	119			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000253117000014	17965007

The effect of EGR on the early flame evolution, two-stage ignition process and spray flame structures for n-heptane spray flames are investigated using large eddy simulation. The two-stage ignition process is identified based on the formation of key species and early heat release process. Results demonstrate that a longer ignition delay (ID) and flame lift-off length (LOL) under lower oxygen concentration conditions could increase the mixing time for fuel and air. However, the first-stage ignition still initiates in fuel-richer regions for the cases with higher EGR rates due to the lack of oxygen. In contrast, compared to the case with the same initial oxygen content but at a higher gas temperature of 1000 K, the first-stage ignition moves to stoichiometric mixture fraction regions at 900 K. The combustion mode analysis based on hydroxyl and formaldehyde is conducted to distinguish between the low-and high-temperature combustion regions. Most importantly, to study the stabilization mechanism, the chemical explosive mode analysis (CEMA) is conducted based on analysis on the local flow time scale and the chemical time scale. During the early stage of ignition, a balance between reaction and mixing implies that cool flame propagates from the ignition spots through the entire flow field. And during the quasi-steady state, autoignition plays a dominant role.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000458760500079		
J	Wang, Vincent C-C								Beyond the Active Site: Mechanistic Investigations of the Role of the Secondary Coordination Sphere and Beyond in Multi-electron Electrocatalytic Reactions								ACS CATALYSIS				11	13			8292	8303		10.1021/acscatal.0c04770		JUN 2021		JUL 2 2021	2021	The development of an electrocatalyst with a rapid turnover frequency, low overpotential, and long-term stability is highly desired for fuel-forming reactions, such as water splitting and CO2 reduction. The findings of the scaling relationships between the catalytic rate and thermodynamic parameters (i.e., free energy relationship) over a wide range of electrocatalysts provide useful guidelines and predictions for designing better catalysts for those redox reactions. However, such relationships also suggest that a catalyst with a high catalytic rate is typically associated with a high overpotential for a given reaction in the molecular system. Inspired by enzymes, the introduction of additional interactions through the secondary coordination sphere (SCS) beyond the active site, such as hydrogen-bonding or electrostatic interactions, has been shown to offer a promising avenue to disrupt these unfavorable relationships. Herein, the influence of these cooperative interactions on the faster chemical steps is further investigated, in addition to the rate-limiting step widely examined before, for molecular electrocatalysts with the structural and electronic modifications designed to facilitate the dioxygen reduction reaction, CO2 reduction reaction, and hydrogen evolving reaction. Based on the electrocatalytic kinetic analysis, the rate constants for faster chemical steps and their correlation with the corresponding thermodynamic parameters are evaluated. The results suggest that the effects of the SCS and beyond on these fuel-forming reactions are not necessarily beneficial for promoting all chemical steps and no apparent relation between rate constants and thermodynamic parameters is found in some cases studied here, which may implicate the design of electrocatalysts in the future. Finally, these analyses demonstrate that the characteristic features for voltammograms and foot-of-the-wave-analysis plots are associated with the specific kinetic phenomenon among these multi-electron electrocatalytic reactions. Such an analysis provides a useful framework to probe the influence of chemical and electronic modifications on the catalytic steps quantitatively beyond the rate-limiting step.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000670659900057

Moreover, with reduced graphene oxide as a platform to in-situ grow N-doped bamboo-like carbon nanotubes encapsulating part of CoO and CoSe2 nanoparticles, we fabricated a novel hybrid (denoted as CoO-CoSe2@N-CNTs/rGO) via a combination of two-stage calcination and subsequent selenization treatment. As an OER electrocatalyst in 1.0 M KOH, CoO-CoSe2@N-CNTs/rGO affords low overpotentials (250 mV@10 mA cm-2 and 322 mV@100 mA cm-2), favorable kinetics (a Tafel slope of 68 mV dec- 1), and excellent durability, outperforming commercial RuO2 and most Co-based electrocatalysts reported till date. Comprehensive experiment results uncover that the exceptional electrocatalytic performance mainly emanates from the synergistic effect between CoSe2 and CoO in heterostructure, N doping effect in CNT and rGO, and the confining effect of N-CNTs and rGO for CoO-CoSe2, resulting in more active sites and enhance conductivity. More importantly, density functional theory calculations disclose that the concurrent N doping and desirable encapsulation of the CoO-CoSe2 nanoparticle in N-CNT can optimize the adsorption energies of OER intermediates and increase the electric conductivity, thereby expediting the OER. This work is helpful to foster understanding on the structure-performance correlations of electrocatalysts with multi-active sites and multi-components for diverse applications.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000672572100002

In this work, BaFe3Al9O19 (BF3) hexaaluminate supported CeO2 serves as oxygen carrier for CLDR. Combined with a series of characterization, the effect of interaction between CeO2 and hexaaluminate as a function of calcination temperatures (700, 800, 900 and 1000 degrees C) on the CLDR performance was carefully investigated, and then the possible reaction mechanism was proposed. The results show that fresh CeO2/BF3 is composed of CeO2, beta-Al2O3 and magnetoplumite (MP) hexaaluminate. Increasing the calcination temperature from 700 to 900 degrees C is conducive to enhancing the interaction strength between CeO2 and hexaaluminate, which favors the diffusion of lattice oxygen to the surface. However, 1000. C calcination leads to the sintering of oxygen carrier, which hinders the migration of lattice oxygen. Among CeO2/BF3-T (T = 700-1000 degrees C), CeO2/BF3-900 degrees C presents not only a high methane conversion (similar to 85%), high syngas yield (1.28-2.02 mmol/g) with ideal H-2/CO ratio (similar to 2), but also excellent CO2 activation ability and cyclic stability in the periodic CH4/CO2 redox cycles. The results were mainly attributed to the highest concentration of Ce3+ and Fe2+, abundant oxygen vacancies and the formation of CeFexAl1-xO3.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0378-3820	1873-7188		WOS:000652818900004

The heating rate and temperature are 3 C/min and 1000 degrees C, respectively. The Gieseler fluidity decreases with increasing blend ratio of non- or slightly-caking coal to caking coal. In addition, the fluidity tends to decrease with the decreasing particle size of non- or slightly-caking coal in blended coals. The evolution of CO, CO2 and H2O during the carbonization of single Coals begins at 200-400 degrees C, and the main peak of the formation rate appears at 450-700 degrees C. The amount of gaseous O-containing compounds evolved until 1000 degrees C from the non- or slightly-caking coals is greater than that of evolved from the caking coal. Additionally, a negative correlation is observed between the amounts of CO, CO2, and H2O that evolve up to the initial softening temperature and the maximum fluidity value. The profiles of formation rates of the three gaseous O-containing compounds from the blended coal during carbonization are different with additive average based on the results of single coals. Furthermore, for the blended coal, the starting temperature H2O evolution measured shifts to higher temperature in comparison with that of calculated based on the results of single coals. Therefore, it is possible that the H2O produced from non- or slightly-caking coal in blended coal or that the H2O formation reactions in blended coal during carbonization affects the fluidity performance of the blended coal.

First, we prepared MIL-88B precursor to give a fairly dispersed frame structure, and then Con+ was doped into disulfides, which are rich in sulfur bonds, and the imidazole group was cleverly connected into graphitized carbon via self-etching of ZIF-67. The doping of Con+ and functional groups makes tiny changes in the sulfide lattice, which promotes the unsaturation degree of the S bond and activates it gradually. The prepared semi frame sulfide with a unique structure, on the one hand, ensures the hydrophilicity and multiple active specific surface area, which lays superior functions in morphology. On the other hand, coupling metals that have strong valence change ability and functional groups by active S bonds play an important role in the process of electrocatalytic reaction. Amazingly, disintegration and self-reconstruction of MILN-based Co(z)-NiMoS occurs during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to the activation of the S bond, which provides a new perspective for the overall water splitting mechanism. The electrochemical results show that the MILN-based Co(z)-NiMoS electrocatalyst exhibits overpotentials of HER, OER, and overall water splitting (OWS) to be 169 mV, 170 mV, and 1.466 V, respectively, making it a promising electrode material for OWS applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000728814100001	34878483

In this study, an onion-like N-doped carbon nanorods hybrid (denoted as ONC) with encapsulated Ni/Fe3O4 heterostructures has been fabricated by the pyrolysis of an NiFe-based coordination polymer under a N-2 atmosphere. The nanorod-like morphology is transferred from the polymer to the hybrids and generates ONC nanolayers encapsulated with core-shell Ni/Fe3O4 nanostructures. The synergistic effects between the ONC layers and the encapsulated Ni/Fe3O4 heterostructures result in high electronic conductivity due to the nitrogen-doped carbon with an appropriate level of defects and enlarged electrochemical surface area due to the well-defined mesoporous morphology. Compared with Ni@ONC, Fe3O4@ONC, NiFe2O4 and commercial RuO2 electrocatalysts, the as-prepared Ni/Fe3O4@ONC exhibits extraordinary electrocatalytic activity for water oxidation with an overpotential of merely 296 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 61 mV dec(-1). This Ni/Fe3O4@ONC OER catalyst highlights the great potential of integrating hetero-composite nanocatalysts with hetero-atom doped nanocarbon supports for the development of high-performance electrocatalysts for renewable energy applications.									63	4	0	0	3	0	64			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000426148500048	29424841

Thermal oxidation is a potentially scalable method to generate pits on monolayer MoS2, and pits are assumed to preferentially form around undercoordinated sites, such as sulfur vacancies. However, studies on thermal oxidation of MoS(2)monolayers have not considered the effect of adventitious carbon (C) that is ubiquitous and interacts with oxygen at elevated temperatures. Herein, the effect of adventitious C on the pit formation on MoS(2)monolayers during thermal oxidation is studied. The in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy measurements herein show that pit formation is preferentially initiated at the interface between adventitious C nanoparticles and MoS2, rather than only sulfur vacancies. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the C/MoS(2)interface favors the sequential adsorption of oxygen atoms with facile kinetics. These results illustrate the important role of adventitious C on pit formation on monolayer MoS2.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000554471200001	32743836

Here, Cu2O-based composites by combining with Co3O4 are designed as non-noble catalysts for ORR/OER by using density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations. Cu-sites in Cu2O-Co3O4 ( 111) structure are the main active-sites for ORR/OER, which can obtain desirable interfacial charge transfer through favorable energy band arrangements. As inspired by calculation results, Cu2O nanoparticles (20-30 nm) coated on hollow zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67)-derived nitrogen (N)-doped carbon-cube (HZCNC) with skeleton Co3O4 are prepared as a hollowly-wrapped structure (Cu2O/HZCNC) for boosting ORR/OER, which makes it have the fast electron/mass transfer characteristics. Catalyst marked as Cu2O/HZCNC-0.425 (mass ratio of copper chloride to HZCNC is 0.425) exhibits better ORR activity (E-1/2 of 0.90 V) and methanol tolerance than Pt/C, a lower overpotential (350 mV) than RuO2 for OER, and a stable cell voltage gap (0.941 V, average) in a primary zinc-air battery even after 200 h. As indicated by density functional theory results, Cu2O can energet-ically supply the electrons to the closely-contacted HZCNC (Co3O4) to enhance ORR/OER activities and stabil-ities.

In this study, via a simultaneous synthesis method, tungsten diselenide/porous carbon (WSe2/C) composites are prepared as the supports/ORR co-catalysts to support Pt with a low loading of 5 wt.%. Varied WSe2/C supports are obtained by tuning the carbonization temperature (600-1000 degrees C) to investigate the relationships between structural characteristics and ORR performance. Pt-WSe2/C (800 degrees C) exhibits a considerably higher specific activity (4.57 mA cm(-2)) for ORR than those of WSe2/C (2.45 mA cm(-2)) and commercial Pt/C (10 wt.%, 2.69 mA cm(-2)), owing to the high ORR co-catalytic activity of WSe2/C for Pt. The robust contacts among Pt, WSe2 and porous carbon with high surface area can significantly improve the exposure of Pt active sites, which correspondingly promote the charge transfer efficiency and the fast adsorption, activation and reduction of oxygen molecules. Moreover, Pt-WSe2/C (800 degrees C) catalyst exclusively exhibits a four electron pathway for ORR. With the intimate cooperation among Pt, WSe2 and porous carbon skeleton, more available Pt active sites are exposed to improve the ORR kinetics and durability. The tolerance to methanol-crossover on Pt-WSe2/C are remarkably enhanced, which should be attributed to the synergistic effects between the exposed edge sites of embedded WSe2 and the porous carbon skeleton with abundant oxygen-containing functional groups. The use of WSe2/C supports with low-cost, high cocatalytic/catalytic activity and strong methanol -tolerance provides a promising way to enhance ORR activity in DMFCs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We report herein on flower-like structures consisting of NiCoP-CoP heterostructural nanowires grown directly on the hierarchically porous nickel framework (NiCoP-CoP/Ni/NF) to achieve a highly efficient HER in alkaline solution (1.0 M KOH). The NiCoP-CoP/Ni/NF is synthesized by electrodeposition of porous Ni layers on Ni foam, followed by simple hydrothermal reaction and phosphorization. For HER, the binder-free NiCoP-CoP/Ni/NF electrode can reach 10 mA cm(-2) current density at a quite low overpotential of 49 mV, because of the combination of porous Ni layers and highly active NiCoP-CoP nanowires. In addition, the NiCoP/CoP heterostructures exhibited remarkable stability under the long-term durability test. This work provides a new strategy that combines electrodeposition and hydrothermal reaction to synthesize effective HER catalysts.

It is established that the majority of nonmetallic inclusions (NI) present within steel are complex oxides of the composition SiO2-MnO-Al2O3-CaO-MgO, at whose surface during steel crystallization and cooling as a rule there is a deposit of MnS. NI composition changes in the course of metal treatment. At the start of treatment, their base is MnO-SiO2-Al2O3, and subsequently there is an increase in content of CaO and MgO as a result of molten metal reaction with slag and lining. The average NI size and overall oxygen content decrease in the course of steel treatment, and this points to effective refining. The composition of NI present is close to that of the slag cover assimilating layer used in the intermediate ladle. A more significant increase is noted in MgO and Al2O3 content within it, and this points to effective assimilation of NI of the most unfavorable types.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0026-0894	1573-8892		WOS:000368702700026

Through element doping, the morphology and electronic structure of the catalyst can be tuned, resulting in both the increase of the active site number and the improvement of the intrinsic activity of each site. Herein, we designed and fabricated Mn-doped CoP nanowires with a length of 3 mu m, a diameter of 50 nm, and the pores between the grains of 10 nm. As a highly efficient electrocatalyst for alkaline hydrogen evolution, the Mn-10-doped CoP/NF (doping amount is about 10 atom %) electrode presented overpotentials of 60 mV @ g 10 mA cm(-2) and 112 mV g 100 mA cm(-2), improved by 35 and 23%, respectively, compared with CoP/NF. Characterizations indicate that Mn doping increases the electrochemical active area, reduces the impedance, and tunes the electronic structure of the material. Density functional theory calculations also revealed that an appropriate amount of Mn dopant at a suitable location can both react as an active site itself and boost the activity of the surrounding Co sites, delivering favorable H* adsorption and rapid reaction kinetics. This result may not only promote the development of hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts but also encourage explorations of the relationship between the property and fine doping structure.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000819503700001	35687832

The results showed that the quaternary groundwater in Dongzhi Tableland had low salinity and good water quality, mainly having transferred from ${\rm{HC}}{{\rm{O}}_3}$-Ca type to ${\rm{HC}}{{\rm{O}}_3}$-Ca-Na type water. Water-rock reaction was not strong, and the groundwater could be affected by cation exchange reaction and the common-ion effect, with a weak effect from evaporation and concentration. The groundwater values of ${\delta ^2}{\rm{H}}$ and ${\delta ^{18}}{\rm{O}}$ in the Dongzhi Tableland were relatively poor and below the local meteoric water line, significantly different from the weighted characteristic value of modern atmospheric precipitation, indicating that the groundwater had paleo-water replenishment components during the wet and cold period, and the composition from modern atmospheric precipitation replenishment was very little. The stable isotope values of surface water in the middle and lower reaches of the Malian River were similar to those of the groundwater in the Dongzhi Tableland, and were on the same evaporation line, indicating that the middle and lower reaches of the Malian River accepted the recharge from the groundwater of the Dongzhi Tableland. Studies of $^{14}{\rm{C}}$ isotopes indicated that the deep groundwater in the Dongzhi tablelands was tens of thousands of years old. Combined with the characteristics of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes, it was believed that the groundwater in the Dongzhi Tableland contained paleoprecipitation components from the late Pleistocene and Holocene humid periods.			研究陇东黄土高原董志塬区第四系地下水与马莲河沿岸地下水、地表水水化学离子分布、氢氧同位素特征与$^{14}{\rm{C}}$年龄,了解董志塬区第四系地下水的水文地球演化规律与地下水补给来源.结果表明,董志塬第四系地下水总体矿化度较低,水质较好,主要由${\rm{HC}}{{\rm{O}}_3}$-Ca型过渡到${\rm{HC}}{{\rm{O}}_3}$-Ca-Na型水.水岩作用不强烈,受到阳离子交换反应和同离子效应影响,受蒸发浓缩作用的影响不大.董志塬地下水的${\delta ^2}{\rm{H}}$和${\delta ^{18}}{\rm{O}}$值在大气降水线下方且相对较贫,与现代大气降水多年加权平均特征值差异较大,说明地下水中存在有湿冷时期的古水补给成分,且来自现代大气降水补给的成分微乎其微.马莲河中下游地表水接受董志塬地下水泄流补给,马莲河源头处主要接受大气降水补给.$^{14}{\rm{C}}$同位素的研究表明,董志塬深层地下水年龄在上千至上万年,结合氢氧同位素特征,认为董志塬区地下水中存在有晚更新世末期与全新世湿润时期的古降水成分.						2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0455-2059			CSCD:6903641

Therefore, we adopt a facile electroless plating method to deposit the Fe-Co-P alloys on the nickel foam (NF) with different areas of 1 cm(2), 4 cm(2), 8 cm(2) and 16 cm(2). The Fe-Co-P/NF catalysts exhibit extraordinary catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media and are comparable to the state-of-the-art IrO2 in 1.0 M KOH, capable of yielding a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of only 250 mV. Furthermore, the Fe-Co-P/NF catalysts show efficient activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with an overpotential of 163 mV at j = 10 mA cm(-2) as well. Remarkably, when used as both the anode and cathode, a low potential of 1.68 V (vs. RHE) is required to reach the current density of j = 10 mA cm(-2), making the Fe-Co-P/NF alloys as an active bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. The Fe-Co-P/NF alloy catalysts with high catalytic activity, facile preparation and low cost would provide a new pathway for the design and large-scale application of high-performance bifunctional catalysts for electrochemical water splitting.

Nevertheless the chemical composition of their atmospheres exhibits common indications of being produced by the accretion, plus ulterior in-situ processing of cometary materials. This is remarkable because while the Earth formed in the inner part of the disk, presumably from the accretion of rocky planetesimals depleted in oxygen and exhibiting a chemical similitude with enstatite chondrites, Titan formed within Saturn's sub-nebula from oxygen- and volatile-rich bodies, called cometesimals. From a cosmochemical and astrobiological perspective, the study of the H, C, N, and O isotopes on Earth and Titan could be the key to decipher the processes occurred in the early stages of formation of both planetary bodies. The main goal of this paper is to quantify the presumable ways of chemical evolution of both planetary bodies, in particular the abundance of CO and N-2 in their early atmospheres. In order to do that the primeval atmospheres and evolution of Titan and Earth have been analyzed from a thermodynamic point of view. The most relevant chemical reactions involving these species and presumably important at their early stages are discussed. Then, we have interpreted the results of this study in light of the results obtained by the Cassini-Huygens mission on these species and their isotopes. Given that H, C, N, and O were preferentially depleted from inner disk materials that formed our planet, the observed similitude of their isotopic fractionation, and subsequent close evolution of Earth's and Titan's atmospheres points towards a cometary origin of Earth atmosphere. Consequently, our scenario also supports the key role of late veneers (comets and water-rich carbonaceous asteroids) enriching the volatile content of the Earth at the time of the late heavy bombardment of terrestrial planets.

Herein, a well-designed nanoarray-structured nitrogen-doped graphite foil (NNGF) substrate is introduced to support Pt SACs in Pt-N-4 construction (Pt-1/NNGF) for HER. Within NNGF, the constructed nanoarray-structured surficial layer for supporting Pt SACs could enhance the exposure of active sites to the electrolyte and improve the reaction and diffusion kinetics; meanwhile, the retained graphite structures in bulk NNGF provide not only the required electrical conductivity but also the mechanical stability and flexibility. Because of such double-layer structures of NNGF, stable Pt-N-4 construction, and binder-free advantages, the Pt-1/NNGF electrode exhibits a low overpotential of 0.023 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 29.1 mV dec(-1) as well as an excellent long-term durability.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000566662000030	32799447

Integration of bifunctional electrocatalysts on both anode and cathode electrodes remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report on a novel and facile strategy to construct the ordered and aligned MoS2 nanosheet-encapsulated metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) derived hollow CoS polyhedron, in-situ grown on a nickel foam (NF). The starfish-like MoS2/CoS/NF heterojunctions were formed due to the ordered growth of the material caused by NF substrate. The optimized 2-MoS2/CoS/NF heterojunction exhibits robust bifunctional electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 67 and 207 mV toward the HER and OER at 10 mA cm(-2), and the long-term stability, which exceeds most of the reported bifunctional electrocatalysts. Such high electrocatalytic performance arises due to the synergistic effect between the MoS2 and CoS phases across the interface, the abundant active sites, as well as the hierarchical pore framework, which collectively enhance the mass and electron transfer during the reactions. The work provides a promising approach to fabricating bifunctional catalysts with custom-designed heterojunctions and remarkable performance for applications in electrochemical energy devices and related areas.

However,their practical application is limited because the existing fabrication approaches mainly depend on the top-down strategy, such as dealloying and template methods, which often require an introduction of sacrificial materials and an elaborate process. Herein, the Ni powders with a unique micron/nanoporous structure are achieved via a direct decomposition and reduction of NiNO3 precursor in the combustion flame. The prepared powders are applied to form monolithic micron/nanoporous nickel (MNPN) through a simple dry-press and heating treatment. The designed MNPN can serve as a robust self-supporting electrode for hydrogen evolution reaction, exhibiting a high catalytic activity with the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 63 mV in 1.0 M KOH and 89 mV in 1.0 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS). Furthermore, the MNPN is also used as an efficient current collector for MNPN-MnO2 supercapac-itor electrodes. The MNPN-MnO2 electrodes show a high specific capacitance of 970 Fg(-1) at 2 mV s(-1) and outstanding electrochemical stability with retention of 103.6% after 10,0 0 0 cycles. Importantly, the work offers a reliable avenue to develop monolithic micron/nano-scale porous metals for a wide range of applications. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Kim, Su-jin; Jung, Hyeseung; Lee, Chongmok; Kim, Myung Hwa; Lee, Youngmi								Comparative Study on Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Activity of Electrospun Nanofibers with Diverse Metallic Ir and IrO2 Composition Ratios								ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING				7	9			8613	8620		10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b00402				MAY 6 2019	2019	Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is of importance in energy conversion processes. This paper reports the facile synthesis of iridium/iridium oxide nanofibers (Ir/IrO(2)NFs) with diverse Ir and IrO2 relative composition ratios and their electrocatalytic HER activities. Highly porous Ir/IrO(2)NFs are simply synthesized via electrospinning and the following calcination at various temperatures (300-900 degrees C). Different calcination temperature alters the actual composition of Ir/IrO(2)NFs: The higher the temperature, the greater IrO2 content exists. The HER activity of Ir/IrO(2)NFs is examined in 1 M H2SO4. Ir/IrO2NF calcined at 300 degrees C exhibits the best HER activity in terms of the onset potential, overpotential generating 50 mA cm(-2), turnover frequency, Tafel slope along with the decent stability for 5 h; the HER performance of this material even exceeds that of platinum, a benchmark HER catalyst. As the IrO2 content in Ir/IrO(2)NFs increases with a higher calcination temperature, the HER activity decreases. Ir/IrO2NF calcined at 900 degrees C consists of only IrO2 and presents the worst activity. DFT calculations show that hydrogen atom adsorption on metallic Ir (not IrO2) resembles that on Pt: similar adsorption energy and adsorbate-substrate distance. Both the experimental and theoretical results clearly demonstrate that metallic Ir rather than IrO2 is a good HER catalytic platform.									30	2	0	0	1	0	31			2168-0485			WOS:000467351200064

However, it usually needs high hydrogenation temperature to form oxygen vacancy for SrTiO3. To decrease the temperature, Pt was preloaded on SrTiO3 to transform H-2 into the active hydrogen through hydrogen spillover. As a result, the surface oxygen vacancy of Pt/SrTiO3-x forms at low temperature to 150 degrees C. Without Pt loading, the defects of SrTiO3 cannot occur even at 400 degrees C. As the hydrogenation temperature increases, the surface oxygen vacancy of Pt/SrTiO3-x rises, and a thin disorder overlayer on the facet loaded with metal Pt appears at 400 degrees C; whereas at 600 degrees C, besides the disorder overlayer, the surface defects at the facets without Pt and bulk defects are produced, indicating the controllable formation of oxygen vacancies. With the increasing of hydrogenation temperature, the activity of Pt/SrTiO3-x enhances, and reaches the maximum at 400 degrees C. The produced H-2 amount of Pt/SrTiO3-x prepared at 400 degrees C is about 3 times as high as that of Pt/SrTiO3. The activity of Pt/SrTiO3-x obtained at 600 degrees C is significantly lower than that at 400 degrees C. The surface oxygen vacancies are responsible for the enhanced activity; while the decreased specific surface and bulk defects produced at high hydrogenation temperature reduce the activity.									12	2	0	0	1	0	13			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000451004100009

Owing to the synergistic effect between Cu3P and CoP, this Cu3P-CoP/CC catalyst exhibits superior catalytic HER performance, needing an overpotential of 59 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4, 24 and 130 mV less than that for CoP/CC and Cu3P/CC, respectively.

In the present work, for the first time, the effects of four ionic liquids as an electrolyte additive in battery's electrolyte were studied on the hydrogen and oxygen evolution overpotential and anodic layer formation on lead-antimony-tin grid alloy of lead acid battery. Cyclic and linear sweep voltammetric methods were used for this study in aqueous sulfuric acid solution. The morphology of grid surface after cyclic redox reaction was studied using scanning electron microscopy. The results show that most of added ionic liquids increase hydrogen overpotential and whereas they have no significant effect on oxygen overpotential. Furthermore ionic liquids increase antimony dissolution that might be related to interaction between Sb3+ and ionic liquids. Crystalline structure of PbSO4 layer changed with presence of ionic liquids and larger PbSO4 crystals were formed with some of them. These additives decrease the porosity of PbSO4 perm selective membrane layer at the surface of electrode. Also cyclic voltammogram on carbon-PbO paste electrode shows that with the presence of ionic liquids, oxidation and reduction peak current intensively increased. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The labelled release (LR), pyrolytic release (PR) and gas exchange (GEx) experiments were interpreted with Fenton chemistry. Oxygen and carbon dioxide evolution from Martian soil upon wetting and nutrient addition Could be attributed to competition reactions between the Fenton-type oxidation of organic nutrients with the aqueous (hydrogen Peroxide + Fe(II)) combination and the iron-catalysed decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. A Substantial evolution of radioactive gas upon addition of labelled organic nutrient Solution to Soil, whereas the ceasing of this gas with a heat treated sample in the LR experiments, was attributed to Fenton oxidation and hydrogen peroxide thermal decomposition, respectively. The Peculiar kinetics of LR and PR experiments - that cannot be fully explained by other chemical or biochemical scenarios - were easily explained with this new hypothesis, i.e. limitation of the Fenton reaction may arise from the depletion of reactants, the build-up of ferric hydroxide oil soil and excessive scavenging by the organic nutrients of the generated hydroxyl radicals. Reabsorption or adsorption of evolved or introduced CO, may involve the formation of carbonate Compounds (e.g., magnesium carbonate and bicarbonate) on the Surface of alkalinized soil as a result Of the Fenton reaction.A critical evaluation of the recent biological hypothesis assuming the utilization Of a hydrogen peroxide-water intracellular fluid by putative organisms (Houtkooper & Schulze-Makuch 2007) is also made.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			1473-5504			WOS:000273383100001

Herein, we report the design and facile synthesis of abundant high-valence cobalt sites by introducing Zn2+ into CoFe Prussian blue analogues (PBAs). The modification results in the drastic morphological transformation from a pure phase (CoFe-PBA) to a three-phase composite (CoFeZn-PBA), with a significant increase not only the amount of highly oxidized Co sites but the specific surface area (by up to 4 times). Moreover, the obtained sample also exhibits outstanding electric conductivity. Consequently, an excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 343 mV@10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 75 mV dec(-1) was achieved in CoFeZn-PBA, which outperforms the commercial IrO2 catalyst. Further analysis reveals that CoFeZn-PBA becomes (oxyhydr)oxides after the OER.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000674966200001	34286711

The use of low-cost and lightweight aluminium foil as a current collector in aqueous batteries is tempting but also challenging due to corrosion reactions. Here we report chromate conversion coated (CCC) aluminium foil as a corrosion-resistant current collector in aqueous lithium-ion battery cathodes. CCC aluminium-based electrodes show better cycling stability and higher coulombic efficiency than those fabricated on stainless steel and titanium foils. Furthermore, CCC aluminium foil suppresses oxygen evolution at high potentials.

The phase evolution, microstructure and dielectric properties of BBSTBV and BBSTBT ceramics were researched. X-Ray diffraction results illustrated that both BBSTBV and BBSTBT could form a homogenous solid solution which has a similar structure with BaTiO3. The optimized properties of (Ba0.8Bi0.1Sr0.1)(Ti0.8Bi0.1Ti0.1)O-3 ceramics with stable epsilon (r) (similar to 1769-2293), small Delta epsilon/epsilon (25 A degrees C) values (+/- 15%) over a broad temperature range from - 58 to 151 A degrees C and low tan delta 0.03 from - 11 to 131 A degrees C were obtained. In the high-temperature region, the relaxation and conduction process are attributed to the thermal activation and the oxygen vacancies may be the ionic charge carriers in perovskite ferroelectrics.									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			0947-8396	1432-0630		WOS:000433238800027

PANI served as an exfoliating and N-doping agent and played a crucial role along with graphene in developing a high effective surface area and pore volume. The NG/W-Ws showed a single kinetic reaction (the Volmer-Heyrovsky step) with a single onset potential for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and decreased overpotentials; this was attributed to the intercalated NG. Density functional theory calculations indicated that NG decreases the energy gap between the LUMO and HOMO levels, and the differential Gibbs free energy of atomic hydrogen on the catalyst surface was close to zero. Therefore, the NG/W-Ws presented a linear relationship between their electrocatalytic performance (e.g., onset potential and overpotential) and mass loading (thickness). The total resistance and capacitance of the NG/W-Ws decreased and increased, respectively, with increasing electrode thickness, highlighting the synergy between the NG and W-W components. We believe that the proposed strategy will ensure the facile fabrication of multicomponent 2D heterostructured nanohybrids for high mass-loading electrocatalyst systems and will contribute to the practical commercialization of 2D nanohybrids as electrocatalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2574-0970		WOS:000730767600001

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising materials to improve the catalytic efficiency of a variety of electrochemical energy conversion reactions. Compared to 3D bulk MOFs and COFs, which are commonly obtained by typical synthesis routes, 2D MOFs and COFs are achieved through innovative synthesis strategies, and exhibit further benefits in terms of chemical and structural properties. Specifically, the large porosity and ultrathin structure of the 2D materials contribute to exotic properties such as large surface area, mechanical flexibility, enhanced electrical conductivity, and rapid mass transport during reactions, which are highly applicable to electrocatalysis. In this review, the synthesis methods of 2D MOFs and COFs are first discussed. Then, the distinct advantages and recent advances in 2D materials for electrocatalytic reactions, including water splitting, O-2 reduction reaction, CO2 reduction reaction, and N-2 reduction reaction, are introduced. Finally, based on existing challenges, crucial issues for the development of reliable 2D MOFs and COFs with enhanced catalytic performance are discussed.									26	1	0	0	2	0	26			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000640241000001

Herein, CeOx-NiCo2O4-U/NF electrocatalyst with umbrella-shaped hierarchical structure was synthesized through a three-step processes including the surfactant induced in-situ fabrication of umbrella-shaped nickel-cobalt complex hydroxide precursor on nickel foam, calcination treatment, and potentiostatic electro-deposition of CeOx. Owing to the co-existence of multiple redox couples, synergistic effect between active sites, enriched quantity of surface oxygen defects, multiple electron transport channels, sharp-tip effects originated from the umbrella-shaped hierarchical structure, the as-prepared CeOx-NiCo2O4-U/NF electrocatalyst exhibited advanced OER activity with a small overpotential of 219 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 67 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH solution, and 328 mV in 0.05 M H2SO4 solution with a Tafel slope of 96 mV dec(-1), much lower than those of reported nickel- or cobalt-based OER catalyst. Moreover, due to the in-situ fabrication strategy and excellent acid-alkali resistance of NiCo2O4 and CeOx components, the as-prepared CeOx-NiCo2O4-U/NF electrocatalyst exhibited long-term structure and chemical stability over a broad pH region. Furthermore, the synthetic strategy presented here offers a new method for the rational design and synthesis of complex metal oxides based electrocatalyst for energy conversion and storage applications with excellent catalytic performance and long-term stability.

In sunlit natural environments, the photochemistry of Mn oxides has been discovered to enable solar energy harvesting and conversion in both geological and biological systems. One of the most widespread Mn oxides is birnessite, which is a semiconducting layered mineral that actively drives Mn photochemical cycling in Nature. The oxygen-evolving centre in biological photosystem II (PSII) is also a Mn-cluster of Mn4CaO5, which transforms into a birnessite-like structure during the photocatalytic oxygen evolution process. This phenomenon draws the potential parallel of Mn-functioned photoreactions between the organic and inorganic world. The Mn photoredox cycling involves both the photo-oxidation of Mn(II) and the photo-reductive dissolution of Mn(IV/III) oxides. In Nature, the occurrence of Mn(IV/III) photoreduction is usually accompanied with the oxidative degradation of natural organics. For Mn(II) oxidation into Mn oxides, mechanisms of biological catalysis mediated by microorganisms (such as Pseudomonas putida and Bacillus species) and abiotic photoreactions by semiconducting minerals or reactive oxygen species have both been proposed. In particular, anaerobic Mn(II) photo-oxidation processes have been demonstrated experimentally, which shed light on Mn oxide emergence before atmospheric oxygenation on Earth. This review provides a comprehensive and up-to-date elaboration of Mn oxide photoredox cycling in Nature, and gives brand-new insight into the photochemical properties of semiconducting Mn oxides widespread on the Earth's surface.									11	1	0	0	2	0	12			0026-461X	1471-8022		WOS:000634327300004

However, the limited active site and low electrical conductivity severely hinder the practical application of MoS2. To address these issues, we herein propose a Se-insertion engineering strategy to fabricate Se- and O-co-inserted MoS2 (Se-MoS2) microspheres composed of intertwined nanosheets. Se and O co-insertion create abundant S defects on the basal plane of MoS2 and thus increase the number of active sites. Additionally, Se and O co-insertion are apt to induce the transition of MoS2 from 2H to 1T phase (similar to 60% 1T MoS2), thereby exhibiting more excellent electric conductivity (similar to 2 orders larger than that of MoS2). Furthermore, optimized Se-MoS2 not only shows electrocatalytic HER activity (an overpotential of 108 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 47 mV dec(-1)), also inherits the outstanding electrocatalytic durability of pristine MoS2. Density function theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the excellent HER performance of optimized Se-MoS2 can be explained with Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism, which is intrinsically attributed to the emergence of new band structures near the Fermi energy level of MoS2, increasing the electrical conductivity and reducing the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000707126000083		
J	Liou, Jiun-You; Sun, Ya-Sen								Tailor-made dimensions of diblock copolymer truncated micelles on a solid by UV irradiation								SOFT MATTER				11	36			7119	7129		10.1039/c5sm01673h				2015	2015	We investigated the structural evolution of truncated micelles in ultrathin films of polystyrene-block-poly(2-vinylpyridine), PS-b-P2VP, of monolayer thickness on bare silicon substrates (SiOx/Si) upon UV irradiation in air- (UVIA) and nitrogen-rich (UVIN) environments. The structural evolution of micelles upon UV irradiation was monitored using GISAXS measurements in situ, while the surface morphology was probed using atomic force microscopy ex situ and the chemical composition using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This work provides clear evidence for the interpretation of the relationship between the structural evolution and photochemical reactions in PS-b-P2VP truncated micelles upon UVIA and UVIN. Under UVIA treatment, photolysis and cross-linking reactions coexisted within the micelles; photolysis occurred mainly at the top of the micelles, whereas cross-linking occurred preferentially at the bottom. The shape and size of UVIA-treated truncated micelles were controlled predominantly by oxidative photolysis reactions, which depended on the concentration gradient of free radicals and oxygen along the micelle height. Because of an interplay between photolysis and photo-crosslinking, the scattering length densities (SLD) of PS and P2VP remained constant. In contrast, UVIN treatments enhanced the contrast in SLD between the PS shell and the P2VP core as cross-linking dominated over photolysis in the presence of nitrogen. The enhancement of the SLD contrast was due to the various degrees of cross-linking under UVIN for the PS and P2VP blocks.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1744-683X	1744-6848		WOS:000360656900007	26251976

The greatest potential of MFC lies in the use of wastewater as a substrate (fuel), which allows combining waste treatment and energy recovery. Recently, a development has been initiated that expands the scope of these bioelectrochemical systems from power generation to an increasing number of further applications. This development has become possible by the introduction of new cathode catalyst concepts. The corresponding devices, here summarized as MXCs-the X standing for the different types and applications-share one common element: the microbial anode. The cathode, however, has to fulfil rather different tasks and thus differs quite remarkably across these systems. In this critical review we analyze the different cathode tasks and the resulting requirements for the respective cathode and discuss the available catalyst options in the light of their major advantages and weaknesses. These catalyst options comprise inorganic, biomolecular as well microbial catalyst systems. Hereby, special emphasis is put on a comparative analysis of chemical and biological cathodes and their individual potentials and limitations. For this purpose, criteria are defined based on relevant properties (performance, price, longevity, etc.) and are evaluated by means of a multi-factor analysis, based on the individual target reaction and catalyst. This analysis is exemplarily elaborated for the oxygen reduction reaction (typical for MFCs) and for the hydrogen production (in MECs) (91 references).									249	12	0	0	99	0	257			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000283141300029	20830322

The metalation of the MOF host is facilitated by the dense arrays of accessible alkyne units that boost the alkyne-Co-2(CO)(8) interaction. The tetrakis(4-carboxyl-phenylethynyl)pyrene linker, with eight symmetrically backfolded alkyne side arms, features strong fluorescence and a dendritic Sierpinski shape. The resultant Zr(IV)-MOF features NU-901 topology (scu net, with rhombus channels) and breathing properties (e.g., the contracted (porous) phase reverts to the as-made phase upon contact with DMF (dimethylformamide)). The inserted Co-2(CO)(8) guests quickly react with air to form atomically dispersed CoO species (nondiffracting), and subsequent thermal treatment at 600 degrees C of the CoO-loaded solid generates an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000526885800044	32233407

Fe. Mg, Mn, Ni and Pb were investigated. Binary mixtures of those metals with V were also studied. The conversion of NO was Studied (300-900 degreesC) using a TGA apparatus and a fixed bed reactor. The reactor effluents were analysed using a GUMS on line and showed the presence of N2O, N-2, CO2 and CO together with some unreacted NO. The best synergetic effects were observed for samples doped with V + Cu and V + Fe mixtures. This synergetic effect observed with addition of vanadium seems to be related with its ability to wet and spread on carbon surface and with enhancement of oxygen-carbon complexes on carbon Surface increasing CO2 evolution, thus generating new active sites.

The result reveals that lignin pyrolysis undergoes a complex initial reaction between 160 and 330 degrees C with significant mass loss (about 20%). Lignin molecular network begins to crack down with lignin monomer linkage breaking and light gas molecular (CO2 and CO) formation as temperature reaching 160 degrees C. Also, polymerization reaction involving forming larger molecular weight lignin pieces took place between 160 and 200 degrees C. After that (200-330 degrees C), lignin cracking reaction is the main reaction with lignin molecular accelerating to form heavy (dimers and trimers) and light units (monomers) in bio-oil and causing more mass loss. At the same temperature range, lignin soften reaction happens and results in lignin surface adhesion, microscopic surface structure changing and functional group evolution. As temperature over 330 degrees C, lignin initial pyrolysis stage finished and entered intense pyrolysis stage, with more oxygen contained functional group cracking and light lignin pieces formed.

Time evolutions of the Si(n+) (n = 1-4) components in the Si 2p spectrum indicates that the Si(3+) component always overwhelms the Si(4+) component during the oxidation up to one monolayer. This is in sharp contrast to the Si(001) surface where Si(4+) > Si(3+) always holds. The dominance of the Si(3+) component is related to presence of two types of bonds on the Si(110) surface and to their possible different reactivity against insertion of oxygen atoms.

In this work, through the classical hydrothermal method and subsequent phosphating procedure, we synthesized for the first time an electrocatalyst with a pyramid-shaped MnCO3 as the main structure, P and Co as co-doping elements, named Co, P-MnCO3, and used it as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The experimental results show that the excellent catalytic activity in alkaline media, with current densities of 10 and 200 mA center dot cm(-2) at 61 mV and 158 mV and low overpotentials, which are better than P-Co (108/234 mV) and P-MnCO3 (175 mV/340 mV), etc. it has more electrochemically active sites, faster charge transfer rate and lower resistance. The excellent electrochemical properties benefit from the unique highly active binary Co, P-MnCO3 pyramid brick sites shortened the ion transfer distance and optimized synergistic effect between the doped metal elements (Co,P between MnCO3), the porous connection between Co, P-MnCO3 and the high conductivity substrate, increased the electron-transfer efficiency between the substrate and material, accelerating the conversion of H+ to H-2; facilitated the release of bubbles and provided excellent mechanical properties for improved catalyst stability. This work provides a new idea for the synthesis of multi-element electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000846478700001

The well-aligned nitrogen doped carbon nanotube array is fabricated via an in situ NCNT growth process using a MO4 unit-exchanged lamellar cobalt hydroxide-nitrate MO4-CoLHN (M = Mo or W) as both catalytic species and precursor and dicyandiamide as nitrogen/carbon source under a hightemperature carbonization process. The electrocatalytic performance with low overpotentials of 23 and 47 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic electrolyte can be achieved in WC-Co@CoSAs-NCNTs/CC and MoC-Co@CoSAs-NCNTs/CC electrodes, respectively. Moreover, these electrodes also show good stability, which could maintain 30 h of stable performance. Coupling various characterizations with density functional theory calculations, it is disclosed that the synergistic coupling interactions exist among NCNTs, CoSAs, Co, and MC as well as N-dopants, facilitating effective regulations on exposed active sites, d-band center, vectorial electron transfer from Co and MC to NCNTs, and enhanced electrical conductivity derived from NCNTs array, which may account for the significant promotion of HER performance.									15	0	0	0	0	0	14			2155-5435			WOS:000637003700018

It is desirable to design highly active and robust nonprecious electrocatalysts as alternatives to state-of-the-art commercially available Pt/C catalysts for large-scale hydrogen production via water-alkali electrolysis.Methods: We developed monolithic nanoporous hybrid electrodes composed of electroactive Mo@MoOx nanoparticles, which are seamlessly integrated on hierarchical nanoporous Cu scaffold (Cu/Mo@MoOx) by making use of a spontaneous phase separation of Mo nanoparticles and subsequently, self-grown MoOx in chemical dealloying.Results: Owing to the unique monolithic electrode architecture, in which the constituent Mo@MoOx nanoparticles work as electroactive sites and the hierarchical nanoporous Cu skeleton serves as fast electron-transfer and mass-transport pathways, the monolithic nanoporous Cu/Mo@MoOx hybrid electrode exhibits superior electrocatalysis in 1 M KOH, with a low Tafel slope of 66 mV dec(-1) and outstanding stability. It only takes them-185 mV overpotential to reach -400 mA cm(-2),-150 mV lower than that of nanoporous Cu supported Pt/C.Conclusion: The outstanding electrochemical performance and excellent structural stability make nanoporous Cu/Mo@MoOx electrodes attractive alternatives to Pt/C catalysts in alkaline-based devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1573-4137	1875-6786		WOS:000700576100005

To overcome the energy loss because of the mechanic steps involved in a complex oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the electrode surface with only a few layers would be an advantage over multilayers for the ease of the electrolyte interaction and gas evolution. Here, for the first time, thin films of CoS2 are prepared on a carbon cloth via a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique via layer-by-layer deposition of Ni that tend to give Ni-CoS2 thin films. Based on varying the ablation of metallic Ni followed by CoS2 as a layer-by-layer assembly using PLD, three catalysts, namely, Ni5-CoS2, Ni10-CoS2, and Ni15-CoS2, were prepared. In OER, to achieve a benchmarking current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, Ni10-CoS2 required a lesser overpotential of 304 mV, whereas others, namely, Ni5-CoS2, Ni15-CoS2, and CoS2, required overpotentials of 328, 336, and 373 mV, respectively, to attain the same current density. The charge transfer kinetics associated with all of the catalysts were analyzed, and the corresponding Tafel slope values for Ni5-CoS2 and Ni10-CoS2 were 75 and 98 mV/dec, respectively, ensuring the facile transfer of electrons at the interface. The assistance of metallic Ni sites also ensured stability for long-term applications. These findings will give a way for other earth-abundant catalysts for the increased electrocatalytic activity toward energy needs in future.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000664576700064	34106695

Weakened O-2 adsorption on pyrites can suppress both oxidation and corrosion, preventing the loss of electroactive components and maintaining their activity. Herein, we report our strategy theoretically and experimentally to establish an engineered CoS2 surface by Ce-doping which exhibits improved electrochemical stability against galvanic corrosion and enhanced chemical stability against ambient surface oxidation for an efficient and robust HER in alkali over 250 h. The Ce-doped CoS2 electrode delivered an activity-durability factor of similar to 31 times higher than that of the CoS2 electrode, indicating the highly stabilized HER activity. Characterization tests on the spent Ce-doped CoS2 showed negligible corrosion current and leached Co ions in the electrolyte, further demonstrating that the Ce-doping protected CoS2 from oxidation- and corrosion-induced leaching.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000477988200007

This work reports one-step synthesis of hierarchical porous prism arrays (HPPAs) composed of Ni-NiO nanoparticles embedding uniformly in graphite carbon (Ni-NiO/C HPPAs), which is derived from metal-organic framework (CPO-27-Ni) prism arrays grown on nickel foam (NF). Remarkable features of the prism arrays, synergistic effect of Ni-NiO/C, porous graphite carbon, high conductive NF, and good contact between catalyst and current collector result in excellent electrocatalytic performance of Ni-NiO/C HPPAs@NF. Ni-NiO/C HPPAs@NF shows a small overpotential of similar to 49.48 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), low Tafel slope of 74 mV dec(-1) and robust stability for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. Especially, the overpotential for HER of Ni-NiO/C HPPAs@NF is only similar to 132 mV at the current density of 185 mA cm(-2), almost the same as the value from the Pt/C. Furthermore, for oxygen evolution reaction in basic media, Ni-NiO/C HPPAs@NF shows better catalytic activity, lower Tafel slope and higher durability than precious IrO2. The above finding offers an effective strategy to design the bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									44	3	0	0	0	0	46			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000451100500026	30360101

In this work, nickel-iron layered sulfide hollow double-shell nanorods were synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal self-templating process followed by a high-temperature sulfurization process. Benefiting from the large electrochemically active surface area of the layered nanosheets, the electronic regulation of the FeS2/NiS2 heterogeneous interface, and the mechanical support of the hollow core-shell structured nanorods, the synthesized FeS2/NiS2 hollow multi-shell nanorods with an open layered array structure (FeS2/NiS2 HDSNRs) show better electrocatalytic performance than the single component FeS2 and NiS2 electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolyte solution. In 1.0 M KOH solution for the oxygen reduction reaction, the FeS2/NiS2 HDSNRs electrocatalyst has a half-wave potential of 0.80 V vs. RHE and an overpotential of only 280 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction and the Tafel slope is only 33 mV dec(-1). The FeS2/NiS2 HDSNRs electrocatalyst used as the cathode of a liquid zinc-air battery showed a peak power density of 130 mW cm(-2) and a charge-discharge cycle life of 480 h at a current density of 5 mA cm(-2), with a voltage gap of only 0.92 V. In addition, the assembled solid-state zinc-air battery also exhibits a charge-discharge cycle life of 11 h at a current density of 5 mA cm(-2), and two solid-state batteries connected in series can also drive LED lights. This study provides new insights for the rational design of nickel-iron sulfides with a layered nanosheet-core-shell structure for electrocatalysis and renewable energy applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000834578700001

However, cobalt oxides exist as various phases, such as Co(II)O, Co2(III)O3, Co3(II,III)O4, and the (photo)electrochemical properties of CoOx are significantly governed by its phase. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a suitable method to form a multifunctional layer for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting because it allows direct growth of a conformal high-quality film on various substrates as well as facile control over its chemical phases by adjusting the deposition conditions. Here, a well-controlled CoOx/SiOx/n-Si heterojunction prepared by ALD is demonstrated for solar-driven water splitting. The phase of the ALD CoOx films can be easily controlled from CoO to Co3O4 by varying the deposition temperature. In addition, this systematic study reveals that its energetic as well as electrochemical properties are changed significantly with the phase. Whereas CoO grown at 150 degrees C produces high photovoltage by building desirable hole-selective heterojunctions with n-Si, Co3O4 formed at 300 degrees C has a better catalytic property for water oxidation. To address this competitive correlation, we developed a double-layered (DL) ALD CoO, film that has advantages of both CoO and Co3O4. The DL ALD CoOx/SiOx/Si heterojunction photoanode produces a photocurrent density of 3.5 mA/cm(2) without a buried junction and maintains a saturating current density of 32.5 mA/cm(2) without noticeable degradation during 12 h in 1 M KOH under a simulated 1 sun illumination.									37	2	0	0	2	0	37			2155-5435			WOS:000447224100085

A series of TiO2 materials with a tunable concentration ratio of bulk and surface oxygen vacancies were prepared through a NaBH4 solidstate reduction method. The results of HRTEM, XPS, ESR, PL and UV-vis DRS verify that surface oxygen vacancies can form on the surface of TiO2 and the concentrations of bulk single-electron-trapped oxygen vacancies and surface oxygen vacancies increase with the increase of the reduction degree. Combining the evaluation of photocatalytic hydrogen production with the analysis of positron annihilation lifetime spectra, it is proved that the concentration ratio of bulk single-electron-trapped oxygen vacancies/surface oxygen vacancies plays the key role in the photocatalytic hydrogen production of TiO2, and the optimal ratio of bulk single-electron-trapped oxygen vacancies/surface oxygen vacancies leads to the best photoactivity.									39	4	0	0	6	0	40			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000434386000007

Herein, a bimetallic multi-level layered catalytic electrode composed of Ni3S2 nanosheets with secondary Co-NiOOH layer of 3D porous and free-standing cathode in alkaline medium is reported. This integrated synergistic catalytic electrode exhibits excellent HER electrocatalytic performance. The resultant Ni0.67Co0.33/Ni3S2@NF electrode displays the highest HER activity with only overpotentials of 87 and 203 mV to afford current densities of 10 and 100 mA center dot cm(-2), respectively, and its Tafel slope is 80 mV center dot dec(-1). The chronopotentiometry operated at high current density of 50 mA center dot cm(-2) shows negligible deterioration, indicating better stability of Ni0.67Co0.33/Ni3S2@NF electrode than Pt/C (20 wt.%). Such a desirable catalytic performance is attributed to the modification of physical and electronic structure that exposes abundant active sites and improves the intrinsic catalytic activity toward HER, which is also confirmed by electrochemically active surface area and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. This work provides a strong support for the rational design of high-performance bimetallic electrodes for industrial water splitting.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000758926200001	35187802

U-ore was set as the variable for comparison. Meanwhile, anhydrous pyrolysis under the same conditions was carried out as the control experiments. The determination of liquid products indicates that the presence of water and minerals obviously enhanced the yields of C15+ and the amounts of hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gases. Such results may be attributed to water-organic matter reaction in the high-temperature system, which can provide additional hydrogen and oxygen for the generation of gas and liquid products from organic matter. It is found that delta D values of hydrocarbon gases generated in both hydrous pyrolysis experiments are much lower than those in anhydrous pyrolysis. What is more, dD values are lower in the hydrous pyrolysis with uranium ore. Therefore, we can infer that water-derived hydrogen played a significant role during the kerogen thermal evolution and the hydrocarbon generation in our experiments. Isotopic exchange was facilitated by the reversible equilibration between reaction intermediaries with hydrogen under hydrothermal conditions with uranium ore. Carbon isotopic fractionations of hydrocarbon gases were somehow affected by the presence of water and the uranium ore. The increased level of i-C-4/n-C-4 ratios for gas products in hydrous pyrolysis implied the carbocation mechanism for water-kerogen reactions.									5	3	0	0	0	0	7			1672-5107	1995-8226		WOS:000401929700006

Herein, an easy and fast one-step electrodeposition process is developed to fabricate W-doped NiFe (NiFeW)-layered double hydroxides with ultrathin nanosheet features at room temperature and ambient pressure as bifunctional catalysts for water splitting. Notably, the NiFeW nanosheets require overpotentials of only 239 and 115 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively, to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) in alkaline media. Their exceptional performance is further demonstrated in a full electrolyzer configuration with the NiFeW as both anode and cathode catalysts, which achieves a low cell voltage of 1.59 V at 10 mA/cm(2), 110 mV lower than that of the commercial IrO2 (anode) and Pt (cathode) catalysts. Moreover, the NiFeW nanosheets are superior to various recently reported bifunctional electrocatalysts. Such remarkable performances mainly ascribe to W doping, which not only effectively modulates the electrocatalyst morphology but also engineers the electronic structure of NiFe hydroxides to boost charge-transfer kinetics for both the OER and HER. Hence, the ultrathin NiFeW nanosheets with an efficient fabrication strategy are promising as bifunctional electrodes for alkaline water electrolyzers.									21	0	0	0	3	0	21			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000648552500049	33900730

In this paper, we design a novel Fe3C nanoparticles embedded and nitrogen and phosphorus co-doped porous carbon nanofibers (denoted as Fe3C-NP-PCFs). As the activation efficacy of phosphoric acid in the pyrolysis processes, the resultant 3D Fe3C-NP-PCFs networks acquire a larger surface area, more meso/macroporous structures, more carbon edges/defects and more HER active sites (such as Fe3C@C units, N-C bonds and P-C bonds) than the Fe3C-N-PCFs control sample. The electrochemical test results indicate that the optimal Fe3C-NP-PCFs display excellent E-onset and E-10 values of -113.61 and -197.85 mV vs. RHE toward HER in 0.5 M H2SO4, which are just 80 and 132 mV more negative than those of commercially available 20 wt% Pt/C (E-onset = -33.86 mV vs. RHE and E-10 = -65.75 mV vs. RHE), respectively. Meanwhile, the Fe3C-NP-PCFs also exhibit a superior long-term stability toward HER catalysis. At last, this work opens a new avenue for further boosting the HER catalytic ability of Fe-based electrocatalysts, which may expedite the commercialization processes of Fe-based HER electrocatalysts.

Thus, developing efficient but low-cost electrocatalysts is important. In the present paper, we applied gamma-graphyne (gamma Gy) doped with B, N, O, P and S as NRR catalysts, and the activities of these catalysts were studied by extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our results suggest that single N, O, P and S doping are not effective in enhancing gamma Gy NRR activity, and the gamma Gy with B (sp(2))-C(sp)-B(sp) configuration has excellent overall NRR activity with a record low limiting potential (-0.12 V), good conductivity, low hydrogen evolution reaction activity and high dynamic stability. We revealed that the spC directly connected to active sp-B can be an energy buffer that makes a flat potential energy surface. Overall, our research provides several good NRR catalysts by carefully controlling the doping sites and provides a new strategy for further development of metal-free catalysts for the NRR.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000724811800006

However, any thorough investigation has not been probed till date to understand the effect of simultaneous and individual incorporation of these Lewis acid and base centers in graphene towards electrocatalytic activity. In this investigation it was found that the incorporation of B and N in reduced graphene oxide (rGO) facilitated substrate adsorption-desorption and also modulated lattice parameters and electronic structure of it. Although N doped rGO showed better substrate adsorption efficiency in HER however, the substrate diffusion was sluggish in this case. Despite of moderate substrate adsorption efficiency of B and N-doped rGO, it showed better HER catalytic activity due to faster substrate diffusion and achieved 550 mA cm(-2) current density at 327 mV overpotential. The B-doped rGO showed better substrate adsorption efficiency in OER. However, due to better charge transfer efficiency of N-doped rGO, it showed superior OER catalytic activity as OER was governed by charge transfer kinetics. In addition to electrocatalytic efficiency, the mechanistic of the electrocatalysis process also altered due to the simultaneous and individual incorporation of Lewis acid and base centers.

J	Yan, Jianhui; Huang, Yang; Zhang, Li; Zhou, Minjie; Yang, Peng; Chen, Wanjun; Deng, Xiaomei; Yang, Haihua								Preparation of MoS2-Graphene-NiO@Ni foam composite by sol coating for (photo)electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction								JOURNAL OF SOL-GEL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				93	2			462	470		10.1007/s10971-019-05195-w		NOV 2019		FEB 2020	2020	Ni foam was first preoxidized by hydrogen peroxide to form a thin NiO layer, and subsequently deposited with graphene and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) by a facile sol assisted dip-coating method to obtain MoS2-Graphene-NiO@Ni composite. XRD, SEM, TEM, HRTEM, and XPS measurements were performed to analyze the crystal phase, morphology, and surface elemental chemical states of the as-prepared MoS2-Graphene-NiO@Ni composite. The results show that MoS2 nanosheets and graphene were well dispersed on the surface of the preoxidized Ni foam with intimate interfacial contact. The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of the Ni foam based electrocatalysts were tested in concentrated alkaline aqueous electrolyte (1 M KOH). Compared with bare Ni foam, NiO@Ni and MoS2-NiO@Ni sample, the MoS2-Graphene-NiO@Ni electrode delivered superior HER performance with a lower overpotential of 150 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a smaller Tafel slope of 80 mV dec(-1), and a charge transfer resistance (R-ct) of 15.14 omega. Under simulated sunlight irradiation (150 W Xenon lamp with AM 1.5 optical filter), the overpotential and Tafel slope of the MoS2-Graphene-NiO@Ni composite was further slightly reduced. The enhanced HER performance of the MoS2-Graphene-NiO@Ni composite is dominantly attributed to the synergistic effect of preoxidized Ni foam substrate, high conductive graphene and electrocatalytic active MoS2.[GRAPHICS].									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0928-0707	1573-4846		WOS:000501026400001

However, NRR is often hampered by the high N-2 adsorption/activation ener-gies and is accompanied by a slow kinetics oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, a robust Bi2S3/OV-Bi2MoO6 S-scheme heterojunction is constructed using a simple in-situ anion exchange process, which enables oxygen vacancy (OVs) abundant Bi2MoO6 microspheres with surface deposited Bi2S3. The as-fabricated Bi2S3/OV-Bi2MoO6 functioned as an effective photocatalyst to convert N-2-to-NH3 under mild conditions. The photocatalytic NH3/NH4+ production rate reached 126 mu mol g(cat)(-1) under visible light for 2.5 h with 2% of Bi2S3/OV-Bi2MoO6 photocatalyst, which was 8-fold higher than pristine Bi2MoO6. Fur-thermore, the as-fabricated Bi2S3/Bi2MoO6 heterojunction exhibited good selectivity, high stability and reproducibility. The excellent photocatalytic NRR performance was ascribed to the Bi2S3/Bi2MoO6 hetero-junction formed subsequent to the strong interaction between Bi2S3 and Bi2MoO6. The OVs facilitated the chemical adsorption process allowing activation of N-2 molecule on the Bi2S3/Bi2MoO6. Simultane-ously, the S-scheme heterojunction prolonged the lifetime of photogenerated carriers, accelerated the electrons/holes spatial separation and accumulation on the Bi2S3 (reduction) and Bi2MoO6 side (oxida-tion), respectively, thus strengthening both OER and NRR half-reactions. This simple in-situ anion ex-change method offers a novel technique for strengthening OER and NRR half-reactions in Bi-based pho-tocatalysts for effective photocatalytic ammonia generation.

Herein, nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (NOMC) is adopted as a bifunctional metal-free electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction and oxygen evolution reaction in the near-neutral electrolyte. The ordered mesoporous structures and abundant N-dopings of NOMC facilitate the accessibility and utilization of the active sites, which endow NOMC with excellent electrocatalysis performance and outstanding stability. Especially, a nearly 100% CO Faradaic efficiency is achieved at an ultralow overpotential of 360 mV for CO2 reduction. When constructed as an aqueous rechargeable Zn-CO2 battery using NOMC as the cathode, it yields a high peak power density of 0.71 mW cm(-2), a good cyclability of 300 cycles, and excellent energy efficiency of 52.8% at 1.0 mA cm(-2).									42	5	0	0	4	0	42			2366-9608			WOS:000608234200001	34927841

Herein, we present a comprehensive high-throughput study on the stability and photocatalytic performance of transition metal double chalcogenide monolayers MXY (M = transition metal; X, Y = O, S, Se, Te; X not equal Y) using first-principles calculations combined with polarizable continuum solvation models to describe solvent effects. Eleven out of 384 candidates exhibit appropriate bandgaps ranging from 1.99 to 2.71 eV, appropriate band edge positions matching water redox potentials, strong anisotropy of carrier mobilities, pronounced light absorption in the visible and ultraviolet regions, and high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (up to 33%). Further reaction kinetics analysis shows that the photogenerated electrons and holes can readily drive water oxidation and hydrogen reduction half-reactions in PtSO and PtSeO monolayers under neutral conditions, where the overpotential is only 0.17, 0.13, 0.10, and 0.12 V for hydrogen evolution reactions in NiSO, NiSeO, PdTeO, and PtTeO monolayers, respectively. Our findings highlight transition metal double chalcogenides with high experimental feasibility as promising efficient bifunctional catalysts for photochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting without sacrificial reagents or cocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000814720800001

It is widely believed that sterol 14 alpha-demethylase (CYP51), an essential enzyme of sterol biosynthesis, is the ancestor of the whole P450 superfamily given its conservation across species in different biological kingdoms. Herein we have utilized X-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations, phylogenetics and electron transfer measurements to interrogate the nature of P450-redox partner binding using the naturally occurring fusion protein, CYP51-ferredoxin found in the sterol-producing bacterium Methylococcus capsulatus. Our data advocates that the electron transfer mechanics in the M. capsulatus CYP51-ferredoxin fusion protein involves an ensemble of ferredoxin molecules in various orientations and the interactions are transient. Close proximity of ferredoxin, however, is required to complete the substrate-induced large-scale structural switch in the P450 domain that enables proton-coupled electron transfer and subsequent oxygen scission and catalysis. These results have fundamental implications regarding the early evolution of electron transfer proteins and for the redox reactions in the early steps of sterol biosynthesis. They also shed new light on redox protein mechanics and the subsequent diversification of the P450 electron transfer machinery in nature.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000861951000036	36171457

The conversion rate,reducing rate and electrochemical properties of electrolyte prepared by oxalic acid,ascorbic acid,tartaric acid,citric acid,hydrogen peroxide,formic acid,and acetic acid were compared. It was found that oxalic acid had higher conversion rate,higher reducing rate,and better electrochemical activity. The reaction kinetics analysis indicated that the reaction of oxalic acid reduction is exothermic reaction,and could proceed spontaneously at room temperature. The parameters of preparation process was optimized,under the conditions of n(H_2C_2O_4): n(V_2O_5)=1∶1,reaction temperature 90℃,reaction time 100min and n(H_2SO_4)∶n(V_2O_5)=5∶1,the conversion rate and reducing rate reached 94.8% and 93.55%, respectively. The electrochemical analysis of electrolyte showed that the electrolyte prepared by oxalic acid could inhibit the oxygen evolution reaction. It also showed that the mass transfer and charge transfer process and reaction rate were improved. Using oxalic acid as reducing agent could prepare electrolyte efficiently in lower temperature,and the prepared electrolyte has good electrochemical properties and stability.			以V_2O_5为原料,采用化学还原法制备钒电池电解液。对比草酸、抗坏血酸、酒石酸、柠檬酸、双氧水、甲酸、乙酸制备所得钒电池电解液的转化率、还原率及电化学性能,发现草酸制得的电解液转化率及还原率较高,且其电化学活性明显优于其他还原剂。对草酸制备电解液的反应动力学进行分析,发现该反应为放热反应且在常温下能自发进行。对制备过程中的各项参数进行优化,在n(H_2C_2O_4)∶n(V_2O_5)=1∶1、反应温度90℃、反应时间100min、 n(H_2SO_4)∶n(V_2O_5)=5∶1的条件下,电解液的转化率与还原率达到了94.80%和93.55%。草酸和VOSO_4制备的电解液电化学分析结果表明草酸制备的电解液能够抑制析氧副反应的发生,具有较大的扩散系数、交换电流密度、电极反应标准速率常数和较小的极化电阻,对电极反应的传质过程和传荷过程有促进作用,提高了电极反应速率。以草酸为还原剂能够在较低温度下高效地制备具有良好的电化学性能及稳定性的钒电池电解液。						0	0	0		0	0	0			1000-6613			CSCD:5897209

It has been reported that electron-chemical conversion of metal OER chalcogenides into oxides/hydroxides would take place after the OER. However, the transition mechanism of such unstable structures, as well as the real active sites and catalytic activity during the OER for these electrocatalysts, has not been understood yet; therefore a direct observation for the electrocatalytic water oxidation process, especially at nano or even angstrom scale, is urgently needed. In this research, by employing advanced Cs-corrected transmission electron microscopy (TEM), a step by step oxidational evolution of amorphous electrocatalyst CoSx into crystallized CoOOH in the OER has been in situ captured: irreversible conversion of CoSx to crystallized CoOOH is initiated on the surface of the electrocatalysts with a morphology change via Co(OH)(2) intermediate during the OER measurement, where CoOOH is confirmed as the real active species. Besides, this transition process has also been confirmed by multiple applications of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and other ex situ technologies. Moreover, on the basis of this discovery, a high-efficiency electrocatalyst of a nitrogen-doped graphene foam (NGF) coated by CoSx has been explored through a thorough structure transformation of CoOOH. We believe this in situ and in-depth observation of structural evolution in the OER measurement can provide insights into the fundamental understanding of the mechanism for the OER catalysts, thus enabling the more rational design of low-cost and high-efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting.									221	10	0	0	7	0	221			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000454567500060	30508382

[7]. The reactions initiated by UV photolysis of N2O/I-2 mixtures have been used to probe details of this dissociation model, and provide additional validation. Pulsed photolysis of both N2O and I-2, was used to generate I(P-2(1/2)), I(P-2(3/2)), and O-2(a(1)Delta). Emission spectroscopy and laser induced fluorescence techniques were used to follow the time evolutions of I(P-2(1/2)) and I-2. Suppression of the chain propagation stage of I-2 dissociation has been observed for the first time. Computational modeling indicated that the observed kinetics are consistent with the revised dissociation model.

Herein, cobalt phosphides confined in porous P-doped carbon materials (Co-P@PC) are fabricated by calcinating the cobalt-phosphonate complex formed between 1-hydroxyethylidenediphosphonic acid and Co(NO3)(2) in alkaline solution. The P-containing ligand in the complex acts as the carbon source as well as in situ phosphorizing agent for the formation of cobalt phosphides and doping P element into carbon material upon calcination. The Co-P@PC exhibits high activity for all-pH hydrogen evolution reaction (overpotentials of 72, 85, and 76 mV in acidic, neutral, and alkaline solutions at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) and oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solution (an overpotential of 280 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2)). The alkaline electrolyzer assembled from the Co-P@PC electrodes delivers the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the voltage of 1.60 V with a durability of 60 h. The excellent activity and long-term stability of the Co-P@PC derives from the synergistic effect between the active cobalt phosphides and the porous P-doped carbon matrix.									113	8	0	0	5	0	114			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000528591900025	30908837

Water electrolysis to produce hydrogen is a promising energy conversion technology but limited to the large overpotential; thus, a highly efficient electrocatalyst is urgently needed. Herein, Ru-based electrocatalysts including an ultrathin Ru/three-dimensional (3D) macropore N-doped carbon framework (Ru/3DMNC) and ultrathin RuO2/3D macropore N-doped carbon framework (RuO2/3DMNC) are first prepared using a Zn-centered metal-organic framework (MOF, ZIF-8) as the precursor. The ultrathin 3D macropore framework structure together with N doping endows the as-synthesized Ru-based electrocatalysts with abundant exposed catalytic active sites, good electroconductivity, and excellent electron/mass transport, accomplishing improved activities for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and overall water splitting. The Ru/3DMNC and RuO2/3DMNC present low overpotentials of 50.96 and 216.74 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the overall water splitting device constructed by Ru/3DMNC and RuO2/3DMNC as the cathode and anode catalysts, respectively, affords a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) only at 1.51 V, which is superior to the Pt/C parallel to RuO2 cell (1.573 V).

However, it still remains a major challenge to engineer bifunctional performance. Here, we put forward a highly efficient water electrolyzer based on Ni3S2-based materials. The hierarchical structure of Ni3S2 can be well regulated for optimizing the HER catalytic activity. The best c-Ni3S2/NF electrode exhibits a much smaller overpotential of 220 mV to reach the current density of 100 mA cm(-2). Upon introducing Fe species onto the Ni3S2/NF electrode by a simple dipping/drying method, the intrinsic OER activity can be extremely improved. As a result, the Fe-c-Ni3S2/NF catalyst showed excellent catalytic activity for the OER, including an overpotential of 193 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), high specific current density and excellent stability. Post-characterization studies proved that the remaining S anions have an effective influence on improving the OER intrinsic activity. The assembled water electrolyzer also presented superior performance, such as a very low cell voltage of 1.50 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent durability for 120 h in alkaline medium. This strategy provides a promising way to design highly active and low-cost materials for overall water electrolysis.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000651132100001	33998640

In this work, the NRR catalytic activity of single carbon (C) atom embedded into two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides (M2CO2, M = Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W) with oxygen vacancy was systematically evaluated by means of comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) computations. Our results revealed that the embedded single C atom possesses good durability due to its strong interaction with metal atoms around vacancy in these MXenes. Interestingly, through high-throughput screening, the single C atoms anchored on Nb2CO2, Mo2CO2, and W2CO2 nanosheets are identified as promise NRR catalysts with high-activity due to their low limiting potentials (-0.14 to -0.38 V) via a distal mechanism and outstanding selectivity again the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Remarkably, the intrinsic activity of the C single atom supported by these MXenes mainly originates from the activation degree of the adsorbed N-2 molecule, which is greatly dependent on the electron filling degree of p(z) orbital in C atom. Thus, by carefully choosing suitable substrates, the single C catalyst can be utilized as ideal NRR catalysts for NH3 synthesis. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Redox mediators are recognized to be key for improving rechargeability. However, it is unclear how they affect O-1(2) formation, which hinders strategies for their improvement. Here we clarify the mechanism of mediated peroxide and superoxide oxidation and thus explain how redox mediators either enhance or suppress O-1(2) formation. We show that charging commences with peroxide oxidation to a superoxide intermediate and that redox potentials above similar to 3.5 V versus Li/Li+ drive O-1(2) evolution from superoxide oxidation, while disproportionation always generates some O-1(2). We find that O-1(2) suppression requires oxidation to be faster than the generation of O-1(2) from disproportionation. Oxidation rates decrease with growing driving force following Marcus inverted-region behaviour, establishing a region of maximum rate.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			1755-4330	1755-4349		WOS:000629296400001	33723377

Co nanoparticle precursor was prepared through a hydrothermal process. The components of precursor and catalyst were confirmed by multiple measurements (X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, line scanning analysis, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, Mott-Schottky curve). The Co@Co3O4 semiconductor catalyst exhibited excellent activity for the photocatalytic water oxidation without any addition of photosensitizer or cocatalyst, with an average O-2 evolution rate of 2778 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) and the Co@Co3O4 maintained 90% of the initial activity even after the sixth run; its oxygen evolution reaction performance under lambda = 600 and 765 nm still remained 16% and 7.2% of lambda >= 420 nm, respectively. The high activity of this photocatalyst was strongly dependent on the generation of Co3O4 nanoclusters on the surface of metallic Co. The synergistic effect between Co3O4 and metallic Co was helpful for electron transfer and separation and catalytic performance improvement, because metallic Co played a crucial role during the water oxidation process.									26	1	0	0	1	0	26			2168-0485			WOS:000444924500027

The integration of optimal nanoarchitecture and multicomponent synergy has been a significant factor for designing a bifunctional electrocatalyst to promote the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In particular, the charge migration, mass transfer, and gas release rate in the catalyzing process are closely correlated with the architecture of the catalyst. Here, ZIF-67-derived N-doped carbon nanofiber-supported (NiCo)S(2 )nano sheet [(NiCo)S-2/NCNF] as a bifunctional electrocatalyst was synthesized using electrospinning, template etching, and subsequent gas sulfidation method. The hierarchical hybrid nanofiber with inner hollow cubes and outer nanosheets provides easy electron penetration, high charge/mass transportation efficiency, and robust structure stability. Furthermore, the MOF-derived carbonencapsuled bimetal-sulfide and the synergistic effect of double active centers are conducive to an exceptional performance, showing low overpotentials of 177 and 203 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and robust stability for the HER and OER, respectively. Meanwhile, the (NiCo)S-2/NCNF electrodes exhibit a small voltage of 1.61 V for overall water splitting activity with an electrolyzer cell at current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) over 12 h. This work presents novel insights into the bifunctional catalyst for promoting the overall water splitting via a MOF-derived nanoarchitecture and multicomponent synergy.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000850658700001	36038523

Ultrathin two-dimensional materials exhibit attractive properties as catalysts for hydrogen production owing to their large surface-to-volume ratios and effective chemisorption sites. However, the catalytically inactive surfaces of the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) possess merely small areas of active chemical sites on the edge, thus decreasing their possibilities for practical applications. Here, we propose a new class of out-of-plane deformed TMD (cTMD) monolayer to anchor transition metal atoms for the activation of the inert surface. The calculated adsorption energy of metals (e.g., Pt) on curved MoS2 (cMoS(2)) can be greatly decreased by 72% via adding external compressions, compared to the basal plane. The enlarged diffusion barrier energy indicates that cMoS(2) with an enhanced fixation of metals could be a potential candidate as a single atom catalyst (SAC). We made a well-rounded assessment of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which are two key processes in water splitting. The optimized Gibbs free energy of 0.02 for HER and low overpotential of 0.40 V for OER can be achieved when the proper compression and supported metals are selected. Our computational results provide inspiration and guidance towards the experimental design of TMD-based SACs.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2079-4991		WOS:000736764100001	34947523

In this work, we report hierarchically structured integrated Fe-MoS2/Ni3S2/NF (NF = nickel foam) materials prepared by a facile in situ solvothermal method, and among them, the Fe-doped MoS2 was assembled into spine-like nanorods. The optimized electrocatalyst (denoted as Fe-MoS2/Ni3S2/NF-2) demonstrated excellent activity and durability for performing the HER and OER in an alkaline electrolyte (pH = 14) with low overpotentials of 130.6 mV and 256 mV (vs. RHE) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), as well as no significant loss in catalytic performance even after 2000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles. An outstanding durability of 180 h could be achieved for OER. The overall water splitting made up of the two-electrode system with Fe-MoS2/Ni3S2/NF-2 as both the anode and the cathode required a voltage of only 1.61 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) along with an outstanding long-term stability of 20 h, displaying its great potential for application in water splitting. The effective construction of multi-component synergistic structures shows a good pathway for high-performance electrocatalysis and energy storage.									23	1	0	0	1	0	23			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000480592500018	31334514

Recently, the use of oxide ion redox for charge compensation has been proposed to realize a higher charge/discharge capacity than that observed for transition metal redox. Different stabilization mechanisms of the reversible oxide ion redox have been proposed. To clarify the mechanism, analysis of the electronic and local structures around oxygen is required. Because of the high-voltage region in which the oxide ion redox occurs, several reactions such as oxygen gas evolution and/or electrolyte oxidation are often included. Thus, operando measurements are required to directly prove this concept and generalize the understanding of the oxide ion redox. This study employs operando soft/hard X-ray absorption spectroscopy combined with X-ray diffraction spectroscopy for four lithium-excess electrode materials with different chemical bond natures. The experimental data together with online analysis of the generated on-charge gas reveal two extreme cases: significantly enhanced covalent or ionic characters in the metal oxygen chemical bonds, which are necessary conditions to stabilize the oxidation of the oxide ions. This finding provides new insights with exciting possibilities for designing high energy density cathode materials based on anion redox.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000507721600013

Seventh International Telecommmunications Energy Conference								125	32						1985	1985	Lead acid batteries are most common for standby-power supply in telecommunication, although they are subject to a number of drawbacks. Side reactions as a result of the charge-discharge regime, reduce the efficiency factor of the charge reaction below one, and the state of charge when the battery is idle. The side reactions are water decomposition causing hydrogen and oxygen evolution, corrosion of the positive grid and top lead, and oxygen reduction at the negative electrode. As a consequence the lead acid battery has to be kept on charge continuously to secure the fully charged condition. Furthermore, it is not possible to establish an accurate balance of the charge and discharge amperehours.					INTELEC '85. Seventh International Telecommmunications Energy ConferenceINTELEC '85.

Using Quantum Mechanics followed by Machine Learning (QM/ML) approach, we can predict the best catalyst faster way and the origin of the cause can be identified for further development of carbon-based catalyst. Using the n electronic descriptor unveiled using density functional theory, we applied the analytical simple fit method and six different machine learning algorithms to develop a highly effective predictive model to estimate AGOH. Furthermore, structural relations of ZGNR and AGNR are demonstrated to estimate the Dn(EF), R-On, and AGOH of different widths of ribbon that reduces additional DFT calculations. By applying both SVR predictive model and structural relations, we predicted the ORR performance of 2500 sites of GNRs and listed a few most ideal active carbon sites with lower overpotential (9 < 0.5V). To validate our study, we predicted the ORR performance of different sites in 0D, 1D, 2D doped graphene systems using SVR model and confirmed the values with the DFT computed results.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0008-6223	1873-3891		WOS:000868911500001

The g-GaN/Mg(OH)(2) heterostructure is discovered to be formed by van der Waals (vdW) forces and possesses a type-II band structure which can promote the separation of photogenerated electron-holes constantly. At the same time, the calculated band edge positions of the heterostructure are decent to induce the oxidation and reduction reactions for water splitting at pH 0. Gibb's free energy change in the redox reaction for the g-GaN/Mg(OH)(2) vdW heterostructure is further investigated that the heterostructure can act as a suitable catalyst in hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction for water splitting. The charge-density difference and the potential drop are calculated across the interface of the g-GaN/Mg(OH)(2) vdW heterostructure, and the potential drop can induce a large built-in electric field, which is also a boost to prevent the recombination of the photogenerated charges. Finally, the applied external biaxial strain is studied that it can improve the optical absorption performance of the g-GaN/Mg(OH)(2) vdW heterostructure. This study provides a possibility of method to design the 2D vdW heterostructure as a photocatalyst to decompose water.									46	0	0	0	0	0	46			0021-8979	1089-7550		WOS:000481451900019

GaN:ZnO without cocatalyst and loaded with Rh, Pt, Cr2O3/Rh, Cr2O3/Pt, and Rh-Cr mixed oxide has been tested for gas-phase photocatalytic water splitting. The results confirm the high activity observed in liquid-phase experiments with Cr2O3/Rh and Rh-Cr mixed oxide as cocatalysts. To investigate the reason of this enhanced activity, the back reaction was studied by reacting stoichiometric H-2/O-2 and monitoring the water molecules produced. The comparison of the two experiments shows that the suppression of the back reaction with the core/shell cocatalysts and the Rh-Cr mixed oxide corresponds to an increase in the net photocatalytic water splitting activity.

A fluorine-doped FeOOH (F:FeOOH) cocatalyst on a hematite photoanode was used to lower the onset potential by 140 mV and significantly improve the PEC performance. Moreover, a more effective dual cocatalytic system was prepared by subsequent loading of a FeNiOOH cocatalyst, which resulted in a further decrease of the onset potential by 270 mV. The final onset potential of the Fe2O3/F:FeOOH/FeNiOOH photoanode was lowered to 0.45 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is one of the lowest onset potential values ever reported for hematite photoanodes. The photocurrent also dramatically increased by a factor of approximately 3 to 0.9 mA cm(-2) at 1.0 V versus RHE. Based on the structural, chemical, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy characterization, the enhanced performance was attributed to the F:FeOOH overlayer, which reduced the surface recombination and accelerated the oxygen evolution reaction activity, and the FeNiOOH cocatalyst, which further enhanced the reaction kinetics. The facile preparation of the F:FeOOH cocatalyst and the design of the dual cocatalytic system will allow the development of high-performance hematite photoanodes.									39	4	0	0	3	0	39			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000449952200013	30215886

Herein, the feasibility of using Ti3C2 MXene nanoparticles (NPs) to enhance the electrocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 for ORR was investigated. By varying the content of Ti3C2 NPs, a series of g-C3N4/Ti3C2 heterostructures were obtained, displaying enhanced electrocatalytic activity, including a positive shift in both onset and peak potentials toward ORR, compared to the original g-C3N4 in basic solution. We attribute the improvement to the favorable electrical conductivity of well dispersed Ti3C2 MXene nanoparticles and also enhanced O-2 adsorption due to the electronic coupling effect between g-C3N4 and Ti3C2 in the heterostructures. This work demonstrates the potential of earth-abundant MXene family materials to construct low-cost and high-performance electrocatalysts.									70	3	0	0	5	0	71			0743-7463			WOS:000469409800003	30703328

At the operational current density of 8.5 mA cm(-2), in 2.8 M KHCO3(aq), the cathode exhibited <100 mV overpotential and >94% Faradaic efficiency for the reduction of 1 atm of CO2(g) to formate. The anode exhibited a 320 +/- 7 mV overpotential for the OER in 1.0 M KOH(aq), and the bipolar membrane exhibited, similar to 480 mV voltage loss with minimal product crossovers and >90 and >95% selectivity for protons and hydroxide ions, respectively. The bipolar membrane facilitated coupling between two electrodes and electrolytes, one for the CO2R reaction and one for the OER, that typically operate at mutually different pH values and produced a lower total cell overvoltage than known single-electrolyte CO2R systems while exhibiting similar to 10% solar-to-fuels energy-conversion efficiency.									140	7	0	0	8	0	146			2380-8195			WOS:000389620400024

The total selectivity for the production of arabinose and erythrose on rutile TiO2-based photocatalyst reaches 91% at 65% conversion. More importantly, it has been demonstrated for the first time that the photodegradation of glucose initially involves C1-C2 bond cleavage (alpha-scission) to produce arabinose in the presence of water as solvent. To unravel the high selectivity on rutile TiO2, EPR and glucose reaction were carried out on rutile TiO2 in the presence of H2O2. It was found that the selectivity of the products is mainly dependent on the reactive oxygen species: the hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) may lead to low selectivity, while the peroxy species lead to a high selectivity. The advantages of the photocatalytic approach for conversion of biomass to value-added chemicals include (1) operation at low reaction temperature, (2) benign environmental effects due to using only water as both solvent and oxidant precursor, and (3) being wasteless due to high selectivity with H-2 as the by-product.

The optimized BiVO4/Fe-MOF/Ni-MOF photoanode demonstrated a photocur-rent density of 1.80 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The onset potential of the BiVO4/Fe-MOF/Ni-MOF photoanode markedly decreased from 0.9 V to 0.69 V in comparison with the pure BiVO4 photoanode. It is speculated that Fe-MOF and Ni-MOF led to more reactive oxygen evolution sites and that the bilayer cocatalysts synergistically promoted the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, which may be the influencing factor for the photoelectrochemical performance of the BiVO4/ Fe-MOF/Ni-MOF photoanode being distinctively enhanced. Thus, this work sheds some interesting new light on the construction of a high-efficiency photoanode for photoelectrochemical applications. (C)& nbsp;2022 Elsevier Inc.

Most previous studies, however, utilize only one technique to modulate the electronic structure, and therefore optimal electronic states are hard to be achieved. In this work, we incorporate both Fe dopants and Co vacancies into atomically thin CoSe2 nanobelts for /coxygen evolution catalysis, and the resulted CoSe2-D-Fe-V-Co exhibits much higher catalytic activity than other defect-activated CoSe2 and previously reported FeCo compounds. Deep characterizations and theoretical calculations identify the most active center of Co-2 site that is adjacent to the VCo-nearest surface Fe site. Fe doping and Co vacancy synergistically tune the electronic states of Co-2 to a near-optimal value, resulting in greatly decreased binding energy of OH* (Delta E-OH) without changing Delta E-O, and consequently lowering the catalytic overpotential. The proper combination of multiple defect structures is promising to unlock the catalytic power of different catalysts for various electrochemical reactions.									113	8	0	0	8	0	112			2041-1723			WOS:000564272800004	32245987

We surrounded binary core-shell nanoparticles with a Pt skin layer. To overcome surface segregation of the core 3-d transition metal, we identified the binary alloy Cu0.76Ni0.24 as having strongly attractive atomic interactions by computationally screening 158 different alloy configurations using energy convex hull theory. The PtskinCu0.76Ni0.24 nanoparticle showed better electrochemical stability than pure Pt nanoparticles similar to 3 nm in size. We propose that the underlying mechanism originates from favorable compressive strain on Pt for ORR catalysis and atomic interactions among the nanoparticle shells for electrochemical stability. Our results will contribute to accurate identification and innovative design of promising nanomaterials for renewable energy systems.									37	4	0	0	0	0	37			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000362588100026

Due to their poor activity, copper-based materials have not been considered apt for catalysing OER. In this work, we demonstrate that unique copper(II) oxide nanostructures obtained via hydrothermal synthesis and subsequent hydrogen peroxide treatment exhibit unusually high and sustainable OER activity. In 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, the CuO nanostructures catalyse OER with current densities of 2.6-3.4 mA cm(-2) at 1.75 V (vs. RHE). The calculated turnover frequency (per Cu site) of similar to 2 x 10(-3) s(-1) for O-2 production is markedly higher than that of high-surface area electrodeposited Cu metal nanoparticles by 40-68 times. The OER activity of the CuO nanostructures is also stable, approaching about half of 20% IrOx/Vulcan XC-72 after an hour-long OER. In situ Raman spectroscopy at OER-relevant potentials recorded compelling evidence that Cu-III active species may be responsible for the unusual OER activity of the CuO nanostructures, as indicated by its signature vibration at 603 cm(-1). This hitherto unobserved peak is assigned, with the aid of the model compound (NaCuO2)-O-III, to the Cu-O stretching vibration of Cu-III oxide. This feature was not found on electrodeposited Cu metal, which exhibited correspondingly weaker OER activity. The enhanced catalysis of O-2 evolution by the CuO nanostructures is thus attributed to not just their higher surface area, but also the higher population of Cu-III active sites on their surface.									42	2	0	0	1	0	43			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000366857300027

However, their insufficient selectivity and activity remain grand challenges. A new type of SnO2 nanosheet with simultaneous N dopants and oxygen vacancies (V-O-rich N-SnO2 NS) for promoting CO2 conversion to HCOO- is reported. Due to the likely synergistic effect of N dopant and V-O, the V-O-rich N-SnO2 NS exhibits high catalytic selectivity featured by an HCOO- Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 83% at -0.9 V and an FE of > 90% for all C1 products (HCOO- and CO) at a wide potential range from -0.9 to -1.2 V. Low coordination Sn-N moieties are the active sites with optimal electronic and geometric structures regulated by V-O and N dopants. Theoretical calculations elucidate that the reaction free energy of HCOO* protonation is decreased on the V-O-rich N-SnO2 NS, thus enhancing HCOO- selectivity. The weakened H* adsorption energy also inhibits the hydrogen evolution reaction, a dominant side reaction during the CO2RR. Furthermore, using the catalyst as the cathode, a spontaneous Galvanic Zn-CO2 cell and a solar-powered electrolysis process successfully demonstrated the efficient HCOO- generation through CO2 conversion and storage.									27	3	0	0	2	0	27			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000594730000001

When the anodic polarization potential raises up to 1.8 V vs. SCE, the anodic corrosion of the graphite might happen and a large number of oxygen-containing functional groups generate. The VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction can be facilitated and the reaction reversibility tends to become better with the increasing anodic potential, possibly owing to the increased surface oxides and the resulting improved wettability of the electrode. Based on this, a real reaction kinetic equation for the oxidation of VO2+ has been obtained on the electrode polarized at 1.8 V vs. SCE and it can be also well used to predict the polarization behavior of the oxidized electrode in vanadium (IV) acidic solutions.

The authors have observed reversible sorption and adsorption of oxygen for the superconductor and their relation to the orthorhombic-tetragonal phase change. The equilibrium content of the oxygen sorption has been measured by isothermal TG. The mass loss above 750degC for the precursors is due to evolution of CO2 from BaCO3 when perovskite formation proceeds. Kinetic analysis has been made on this process. Phase boundary controlled contracting reaction proceeds for precursors from the coprecipitates, and diffusion controlled reaction for the precursor from the mixed 2-ethylhexanoates, while multiple parallel processes proceed for the powder mixture. Discussion is given of the reaction mechanisms in relation to particle size, crystalline state, and the homogeneity of the components.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0366-9092			INSPEC:3417875

Herein, an excellent FeCo alloy nanoparticles (NPs)-decorated N-doped mesoporous carbon electrocatalyst (FeCo/NC) for oxygen reduction reaction, prepared through the pyrolysis of a dual metal containing metal-organic framework composite scaffold is reported. Benefiting from the highly exposed bimetal active sites and the carefully designed structure, the Fe0.25Co0.75/NC-800 catalyst exhibits a promising electrocatalytic activity and a superior durability, better than those of the state-of-the-art catalysts. Suggested by both the X-ray absorption fine structures and the density functional theoretical calculation, the outstanding catalytic performance is originated from the synergistic effects of the bimetallic loading in NC catalysts, where the electronic modulation of the Co active sites from the nearby Fe species leads to an optimized binding strength for reaction intermediates. This work demonstrates a class of highly active nonprecious metals electrocatalysts and provides valuable insights into investigating the structure-performance relationship of transition metal-based alloy catalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2198-3844		WOS:000772280100001	35322604

From a chemical viewpoint, achieving high conversion efficiencies requires subtle control of the catalyst surface and its interaction with the electrolyte. Traditionally, such control has been hard to achieve in the complex multinary oxides used in PEC devices and consequently the mechanisms by which surface exposed facets influence light-driven catalysts are poorly understood. Yet, this understanding is critical to further improve conversion yields and fine-tune reaction selectivities. Here, we review the impact that crystal facets and disorder have on photoelectrochemical reactivity. In particular, we discuss how the crystal orientation influences the energetics of the surface, the existence of defects and the transport of reactive charges, ultimately dictating the PEC activity. Moreover, we evaluate how facet stability dictates the tendency of the solid to undergo reconstructions during catalytic processes and highlight the experimental and computational challenges that must be overcome to characterise the role of the exposed facets and disorder in catalytic performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000857171900001	36148901

In this study palladium nanoparticles (PdNP) supported inside hollow graphitised carbon nanofibers (GNF), designated as PdNP@GNF, opposed this trend. PdNP@GNF exhibited continuously increasing activity over 30000 reaction cycles when used as an electrocatalyst in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The activity of PdNP@GNF, expressed as the exchange current density, was always higher than activated carbon (Pd/C), and after 10000 cycles PdNP@GNF surpassed the activity of platinum on carbon (Pt/C). The extraordinary durability and self-improving behaviour of PdNP@GNF was solely related the unique nature of the location of the palladium nanoparticles, that is, at the graphitic step-edges within the GNF. Transmission electron microscopy imaging combined with spectroscopic analysis revealed an orchestrated series of reactions occurring at the graphitic step-edges during electrocatalytic cycling, in which some of the curved graphitic surfaces opened up to form a stack of graphene layers bonding directly with Pd atoms through Pd-C bonds. This resulted in the active metal centres becoming effectively hardwired into the electrically conducting nanoreactors (GNF), enabling facile charge transport to/from the catalytic centres resulting in the dramatic self-improving characteristics of the electrocatalyst.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000696102500001	34132044

Based on this concept we have developed a new strategy for the double oxidation of n-heptane to enable a biocatalytic resolution for the direct synthesis of heptanone and (R)-heptanols in a one-pot reaction. The bicatalytic cascade employs an NADH driven P450 BM3 monooxygenase variant (WTNADH, 19A12NADH or CM1NADH) and an (S)-enantioselective alcohol dehydrogenase (RE-ADH). In the initial step n-heptane is hydroxylated under consumption of NADH to produce (R/S)-heptanol. In the second oxidation step the (S)-heptanol enantiomers are transformed to the corresponding ketones, reducing and thereby regenerating the cofactor. Characterization of initial hydroxylation step revealed high turnover frequencies (TOF) of up to 600min-1, as well as high coupling efficiencies using NADH as cofactor (up to 44%). In the cascade reaction a nearly 2-fold improved product formation was achieved, compared to the single hydroxylation reaction. The total product concentration reached 1.1mM, corresponding to a total turnover number (TTN) of 2500. Implementation of an additional cofactor regeneration system (D-glucose/glucose dehydrogenase) enabled a further enhancement in product formation with a total product concentration of 1.8mM and a TTN of 3500.									30	1	0	0	11	0	30			1615-4150	1615-4169		WOS:000320275600016

Here, we design an efficient alkaline HER electrocatalyst, coating of WN nanowire core with a Ni(OH)(2) shell supported on a carbon fiber paper (WN-Ni(OH)(2)). In a 1 M KOH solution, the hierarchical electrocatalyst affords a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 170 mV and 100 mA cm(-2) at 245 mV. The enhanced performance of WN-Ni(OH)(2) in the HER is attributed to the synergy between WN and Ni(OH)(2): during water dissociation, hydroxyl groups are preferentially adsorbed on WN and hydrogen on Ni(OH)(2); meanwhile, Ni(OH)(2) could promote hydroxyl group desorption from WN. Thus, the full-surface Volmer reaction kinetics could be enhanced. As a consequence, the WN-Ni(OH)(2) has a reduced activation energy of the HER and enhanced intrinsic activity performance. Meanwhile, the hybrid can reach a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 339 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and an overpotential of 510 mV for the full water-splitting reaction. This interfacial cooperation offers a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst, as well as a hopeful strategy for fabricating efficient nitride-based electrocatalysts in alkaline media.									62	4	0	0	0	0	64			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900020

A thorough understanding of the relationships between the properties and functions of photoelectrocatalytic materials plays a crucial role in the design and fabrication of efficient photoelectrochemical systems for water splitting. This review presents the advances in the development of efficient photoelectrocatalytic materials. First, the fundamentals involved in the photoelectrocatalytic water splitting are elaborated. Then, the critical properties of photoelectrocatalytic materials are classified and discussed according to the associated photoelectrochemical processes, including light absorption, charge separation, charge transportation, and photoelectrocatalytic reactions. The importance of heterointerfaces in photoelectrodes is also mentioned in conjunction with the illustration of some functional interlayer materials. Finally, some strategies that can be employed in material screening and optimization for the construction of highly efficient photoelectrochemical devices for water splitting are also discussed.									263	18	0	0	15	0	264			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000445666000003

Electrodes were prepared in a range of temperatures, 260-550 degrees C, and characterized by SEM and cyclic voltammetry. The voltammetric charge q*, obtained by integration of the CV curves, was recorded as a function of calcination temperature. q* is higher for nitrate than for chloride. H-2 evolution was used as a probe reaction to test the electrocatalytic properties. Polarization curves were recorded and analyzed to obtain Tafel slopes. Results showed that the oxide from nitrate is more electrocatalytic than that from chloride. This is in part due to the more extended surface area of the former, but electronic factors related to the particle size are also evident. q* was recorded after each run of experiments and compared with the values before to monitor the stability of the oxide layer.

J	HE, P; SCHULDER, R; BADER, KP; SCHMID, GH								EFFECT OF CYANIDE ON THE S2-STATE AND S3-STATE IN THE FILAMENTOUS CYANOBACTERIUM OSCILLATORIA-CHALYBEA								ZEITSCHRIFT FUR NATURFORSCHUNG C-A JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCES				47	1-2			69	76						JAN-FEB 1992	1992	Low concentrations of cyanide affect the flash-induced oxygen evolution pattern in thylakoid preparations of the filamentous cyanobacterium Oscillatoria chalybea. At a cyanide concentration of 2 x 10(-6) M the effect lies exclusively on the S2- and S3-state whereas the subsequent flash yields and the steady state are barely affected, showing that the reaction center is not touched by the reagent. The influence of the chemical is characterized by the fact that at basic pH (7.5-8.5) the deactivation mode of S2 and S3 is changed, showing that the cyanide-ion is the reactant. Whereas in the control the deactivation of S2 yields as usual S1 and S-1, the deactivation pattern in the presence of cyanide shows that S2 deactivates - without giving S1 -, to a more reduced state, probably S0. In the flash pattern the two signal amplitudes of the first two flashes are lowered to zero in the presence of 2 x 10(-6) M cyanide and become uptake signals at higher cyanide concentrations. It is seen that in the presence of cyanide S2 and to a lesser extent S3 in the Oscillatoria system apparently react with oxygen. In tobacco thylakoids no effect of cyanide on the flash pattern itself is observed, even at higher concentrations (e.g. 10(-4) M), although the signal amplitudes of the entire pattern are affected at such concentrations. Photosystem II of cyanobacteria is characterized by the absence of the two extrinsic 16 kDa and 23 kDa peptides. As shown by mass spectrometry inside-out vesicles from tobacco thylakoids, in which these two extrinsic peptides have been removed by NaCl-washing, exhibit simulataneously flash-induced O2-evolution and an O2-uptake which both require the presence of Cl- and Ca2+ ions. Both the evolution signal and the uptake signal are DCMU sensitive and are inhibited by KCN. An amperometrically measured flash pattern of inside-out tobacco vesicles shows, if the assay is supplemented with Cl- ions, the usual flash pattern known from the literature. The experiments seem to indicate that even in the washed inside-out condition the S-state system of higher plants is much less sensitive to ambient oxygen than in the phylogenetically older system of the filamentous cyanobacterium Oscillatoria chalybea.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0939-5075			WOS:A1992HD31700012		
J	Ge, Ruixiang; Li, Jing; Duan, Haohong								Recent advances in non-noble electrocatalysts for oxidative valorization of biomass derivatives								SCIENCE CHINA-MATERIALS											10.1007/s40843-022-2076-y		MAY 2022			2022	Electrocatalysis is deemed as a promising approach for sustainable energy conversion and chemical production. Although a variety of cathode reactions (e.g., hydrogen evolution and CO2/N-2 reduction) produce valuable fuels and chemicals, the extensively studied oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at anode only generates O-2, which is not a high-value product. Substituting the OER with thermodynamically more favorable biomass derivative oxidation reactions (BDORs) not only enables energy-saving electrocatalysis, but also provides value-added anode products. Recent achievements have demonstrated that non-noble electrocatalysts are promising for BDORs. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review on recent achievements in the field of electrochemical BDORs catalyzed by non-noble catalysts. We start by summarizing the electrocatalytic oxidation of different types of biomass-derived substrates, aiming to show the advantages of the electrocatalytic pathway and to introduce the state-of-the-art non-noble catalysts. The reaction mechanisms of non-noble-material-catalyzed BDORs are then summarized and classified into three types according to the acceptor of hydrogen species during the dehydrogenation of biomass derivatives. Subsequently, discussions are devoted to the strategies for promoting the performances of non-noble electrocatalysts. Finally, we propose our opinions regarding future trends and major challenges in this field.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000804529700003

For energy-saving H-2 generation, replacing the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction with the thermodynamically favorable urea oxidation reaction (UOR) offers great promise, additionally mitigating the issue of urea-rich water contamination. However, the lack of efficient catalysts to overcome the intrinsically slow kinetics limits its scalable applications. Herein, we discover that incorporating tensile-strain on the surface of a Co3O4 (strained-Co3O4; S-Co3O4) support by the liquid N-2-quenching method can significantly inhibit the migration tendency of Rh single-atoms (Rh-SA), thereby stabilizing an similar to 200% higher loading of Rh-SA sites (Rh-SA-S-Co3O4; bulk loading similar to 6.6 wt%/surface loading similar to 11.6 wt%) compared to pristine-Co3O4 (P-Co3O4). Theoretical calculations revealed a significantly increased migration energy barrier of Rh-SA on the S-Co3O4 surface than on P-Co3O4, inhibiting their migration/agglomeration. Surprisingly, Rh-SA-S-Co3O4 exhibited exceptional pH-universal UOR activity, requiring record-low working potentials and surpassing Pt/Rh-C, this was due to superior urea adsorption and stabilization of CO*/NH* intermediates, revealed by DFT simulations. Meanwhile, the assembled urea-electrolyzer delivered 10 mA cm(-2) at only 1.33 V with robust stability in alkaline media. This work provides a general methodology towards high-loading SACs for scalable applications.									25	0	0	0	3	0	25			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000715382500001

The impact of oxygen incorporation on the growth front morphology has been systematically investigated. Oxygen is incorporated into the growing film through the use of an Al-based precursor, (C2H5)(2)AlOC2H5, which contains Al directly bonded to an oxygen atom. The oxygen appears to be preferentially incorporated at the metal-terminated steps. The presence of one or more Al atoms at the step edge is believed to be responsible for the incorporation of electrically active oxygen into the lattice. Oxygen at the growth front, particularly at the step edges, leads to the gradual roughening of the surface structure. High levels of oxygen, [O] greater than or equal to 10(18) cm(-13), lead to the breakdown of the periodic surface structure found in nominally undoped MOVPE GaAs with a very rough hillock structure resulting. Models for the impact of oxygen on the growth front evolution are presented. The study of the simpler GaAs:O system can provide a basis for understanding the role of oxygen in more complex semiconductor systems.

In this work, a N, P-doped mesoporous carbon (NPMC-T) was synthesized by the SiO(2)hard template. The mesoporous structure and high N, P content for NPMC-T are beneficial to expose more active sites and accelerate electron transfer, and contribute to exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic activity for supercapacitors and hydrogen evolution reaction application. NPMC-800 is applied as electrode material for supercapacitors and exhibits high specific capacitance (219 F g(-1)at 1 A g(-1)). Meanwhile, the NPMC-T is used as electrocatalyst for HER and shows the good electrocatalytic performance with small Tafel slope of 52 mV dec(-1), low overpotential of 298 mV (10 mA cm(-2)) than that of most other reported analogous catalysts, and excellent stability (after 2000 cycles). This effective capability of N, P-doped multifunctional mesoporous carbon materials is expected to promote the application in supercapacitors and hydrogen evolution reaction widely.									12	2	0	0	0	0	13			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000573759600016

A facile strategy is developed in this work to boost the HER activity on non-noble MoS2 catalyst by taking advantage of the platinum-like behavior of nitrogen doped carbon (C-N) active sites for catalyzing the process from H+ to H atom. By doping trace amount of C-N with the defect-rich MoS2 nanosheet catalyst, the HER activity is significantly improved with the onset HER over potential reduced to 50 mV, close to the value observed for the platinum catalyst, and the operational overpotential at 10 mA/cm(2) decreases by 65 mV. More importantly, with graphite as the counter electrode, stability of the catalyst is substantially improved. No activity decay is detected after 4000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) sweeping while the overpotential increment of the prisitine MoS2/C catalyst after 2000 cycles CV sweeping is high to ca. 15 mV.

In this work, a three-dimensional (3D) hybrid of rosebud-like MoSe2 nanostructures supported on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets was successfully synthesized through a facile hydrothermal strategy. The prepared MoSe2@rGO hybrid nanostructure showed enhanced electrocatalytic activity for the ORR in alkaline medium compared to that of the pure MoSe2, rGO, and their simple physical mixture, which could benefit from the excellent oxygen adsorption ability of the abundantly exposed active edge sites of the ultrathin MoSe2 layers, the conductivity and aggregation-limiting effect of the rGO platform, as well as the unique 3D rosebud-like architecture of the hybrid material. The electrocatalytic activity of the MoSe2@rGO hybrid towards ORR was comparable to that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. And the promoted reaction was revealed to involve a nearly four-electron-dominated ORR process by analysis of the obtained Koutecky-Levich plots. The scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) technique, with the advantages of investigating of the local catalytic activity of samples with high spatial resolution and simultaneously evaluating activities of different catalysts in a single experiment, was further applied to investigate the local ORR electrocatalytic activity of MoSe2@rGO and compare it with those of other catalyst samples through applying different sample potentials. The excellent stability and methanol tolerance of the 3D nanostructured MoSe2@rGO hybrid against methanol further prove the 3D nanostructured MoSe2@rGO hybrid as a promising ORR electrocatalyst in alkaline solution for potential applications in fuel cells and metal-air batteries.									25	1	0	0	3	0	25			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000388114400019

Most of the hydrous pyrolysis experiments have been carried out with low-pressure and relatively large reaction space due to experimental device limitations. PVT-L jointly controlled experiments and conventional autoclave hydrous pyrolysis experiments have been carried out with immature shale from the Biyang Sag, Nanxiang Basin, and kerogens from the experiments were characterized by FTIR, which expressed four trends: (1) Accompanying aliphatic group cracking, oxygen-containing group shedding and aromatic group condensation, the evolution of kerogen experienced three periods including slow oil generation, fast oil generation and finishing oil generation. (2)FTIR parameters show more extensive aliphatic group cracking for conventional autoclave hydrous pyrolysis experiments, while there is still relatively strong hydrocarbon generation in the PVT-L jointly controlled experiment. (3)The lower aromatization of saturated hydrocarbons in PVT-L jointly controlled experiment may be relevant to higher fluid pressure in a finite space. (4)The slight increase of oxygen level implies the role of water in the hydrocarbon generation process.

The predicted abundances of the short-lived radioactive isotopes Nb-92, Tc-97,Tc-98, and Sm-146 are given in this framework. The abundance seeds are obtained by calculating s-process nucleosynthesis in the material accreted onto a carbon-oxygen white dwarf from a binary companion. A fine grid of s-seeds at different metallicities and C-13-pocket efficiencies is considered. A galactic chemical evolution model is used to predict the contribution of SN Ia to the solar system p-nuclei composition measured in meteorites. Nuclear physics uncertainties are critical to determine the role of SNe Ia in the production of Nb-92 and Sm-146. We find that, if standard Chandrasekhar-mass SNe Ia are at least 50% of all SN Ia, they are strong candidates for reproducing the radiogenic p-process signature observed in meteorites.									33	0	0	0	2	0	33			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000343857900040

In this paper, we explored the application of Ni-based electrocatalysts in ZnO pohotoanode in order to improve its photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance for overall water splitting. Ni and Ni(OH)(2) nanostructured electrocatalysts were fabricated on ZnO photoanodes using E-beam evaporation and cathodic electro-deposition, respectively. XRD, SEM, EDS, TEM and XPS were implemented to investigate the structure and composition of the prepared films. A three-electrode electrochemical cell configuration was performed to measure the PEC performance. The results demonstrate that introducing Ni(OH)(2) electrocatalysts can effectively facilitate the PEC performance of ZnO photoanodes, which suggests a promising route toward high performance photoanode design for efficient solar energy conversion.

As a result of the exceptional synergism between CoSe2 and Ni3Se4 as well as high conductivity of carbon materials, the obtained CoSe2/Ni3Se4@NC/KB drives an OER current density of 10 mA cm(-2) by an overpotential of 260 mV and displays a low Tafel slope of 68 mV dec(-1), outmanoeuvring commercial RuO2 and IrO2, control groups (i.e. Ni3Se4@NC/KB, CoSe2@NC/KB, and CoSe2/Ni3Se4@NC), as well as most hybrids of selenides and carbon materials reported recently.

When applied as an electrocatalyst towards OER in 1.0 M KOH solution, CoFe CoFe2O4/N-CNTs exhibits a small overpotential of 334 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) associated with a low Tafel slope of 80 mV dec(-1) and long-term stability. The remarkable OER electrocatalytic performance of CoFe CoFe2O4/N-CNTs is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect between CoFe and CoFe2O4 as well as the increased active sites resulting from the introduction of N-CNTs. More impressively, the introduction of Fe can significantly cut down the usage of relatively toxic and expensive Co accompanied with the dramatic enhancement of OER electrocatalytic performance originating from the robust synergistic effect between Co and Fe.

The plasma polymers were deposited on thin glass substrates in dc and rf discharges of acetylene. After deposition, the specimens were mounted in a chamber that could be evacuated or filled with air, oxygen, or nitrogen. Stress measurements were carried out by the bending beam method, using a He-Ne laser. A steady rise in the stress during time periods of several hours following film deposition was observed in most of the samples studied. Stress increments of more than one order of magnitude were detected in some of the films upon exposure to air. Pronounced stress increments were also observed during exposure to oxygen. Rises in the stress were detected even in a vacuum ambience. Nitrogen exposure was found to have little effect on the stress. The effect of the moisture content of air on the stress was also examined. The evolution of the stress was found to depend also on the film preparation conditions. The results strongly suggest that postplasma reactions involving active chemical species trapped in the film during deposition play an important role in the development of the stress.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-8979			WOS:A1991GN97100031

The hyperbranched Co2P are consisted of a large number of nanofilaments. The crystal splitting should be responsible for the formation of this structure. Catalytic performances measurements toward hydrogen evolution reaction for the obtained hyperbranched Co2P nanocrystals demonstrate a small overpotential of 100 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2), with a Tafel slope of 67 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH. Durability tests show that slight catalytic activity fading occurs after 2000 CV cycles or 22 h chronoamperometric testing. In addition, the hyperbranched Co2P also perform well in 0.5 M H2SO4 with a low overpotential of 107 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 69 mV dec(-1). This facile method provides a strategy for the preparation of low-cost metal phosphide electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution in both alkaline and acidic media.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2046-2069			WOS:000474306500014	35515561

Transition metals have attracted particular research interest in pursuit of such efficient and sustainable ORR electrocatalysts. In this work, very tiny Co nanoparticles were assembled on 3D graphene (3DG) aerogels uniformly with the help of ascorbic acid (AA) under a facile hydrothermal process. After further thermal annealing in argon, a few carbon layers are formed and wrapped on the Co nanoparticles. The synthesized materials were primarily investigated for ORR, and the experimental results indicate that the as-prepared Co/3DG shows an obviously positive onset potential (-0.01 V) and a much higher limiting current density (5.75 mA/cm(2)) than Co/3DG prepared without using AA (-0.1 V, 4.6 mA/cm(2)). Compared with commercial 20%Pt/C, Co/3DG prepared by using AA also displayed excellent durability and superb methanol tolerance performance, which suggests that the special structure of cobalt nanoparticles wrapped with a few carbon layers and its porous 3DG aerogel support can prevent its expansion and dissolution, improve its stability largely, and provide a new way for searching excellent ORR electrocatalysts.

However, such materials' real-world applicability is hindered because of scalability and reproducibility issues as they are produced by multistep postsynthesis modification of MOFs, often with high-temperature carbonization and/or calcination. In this process, MOFs act as self-sacrificial templates to develop functional materials at the expense of severe mass loss, and the resultant materials exhibit complex process-performance relationships. In this work, we report the direct applicability of a readily synthesized and commercially available MOF, a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8), in a rechargeable zinc-air battery. The composite of cobalt-based ZIF-8 and platinum carbon black (ZIF-67@Pt/CB) prepared via facile solution mixing shows a promising bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the key charge and discharge mechanisms in a battery. ZIF-67@Pt/CB exhibits long OER/ORR activity durability, notably, a significantly enhanced ORR stability compared to Pt/CB, 85 versus 52%. Interestingly, a ZIF-67@Pt/CB-based battery delivers high performance with a power density of >150 mW cm(-2) and long stability for 100 h of charge-discharge cyclic test runs. Such remarkable activities from as-produced ZIF-67 are attributed to the electrochemically driven in situ development of an active cobalt-(oxy)hydroxide nanophase and interfacial interaction with platinum nanoparticles. This work shows commercial feasibility of zinc-air batteries as MOF-cathode materials can be reproducibly synthesized in mass scale and applied as produced.									22	2	0	0	1	0	22			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000575557800025	32852934

Herein, a novel all solid-state 2D-2D Z-scheme photocatalytic system is designed and constructed by coupling black phosphorus nanosheets (2D BP) with alpha-Fe2O3 nanoplates. 2D BP is used as an HPP and solid-state charge transfer mediator to produce H-2 and accelerate charge transfer, while alpha-Fe2O3 serves as an OPP. The introduction of 2D BP as solid-state charge transfer mediator promotes the carrier transfer, thus simultaneously realizing efficient H-2 and O-2 evolution. The optimum O-2 and H-2 evolution rates on this Z-scheme system are approximately 0.29 and 0.59 mu mol h(-1), respectively, under simulated visible light illumination without using sacrificial agents. This study suggests the significance of a solid charge transfer mediator to accelerate the migration and separation of interface charges, thus improving the photocatalytic overall water splitting performance.									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000613888900025

TONs were firstly prepared by anodization of pure Ti foil in HF solution followed by annealing in air and N-2 atmosphere. The morphology and structure of the electrocatalysts were characterized by scanning (SEM), transmission (TEM) electron microscopies, X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electrochemical techniques. SEM, TEM, XRD and EDX characterization indicate the presence of platinum nanoparticles with diameter less than 50 nm and uniformly incorporated into TON arrays. The electrocatalytic activities results show that the Pt-B/TON-N-2 catalyst has higher catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) compared with PtB/TON-air and electrodes prepared using hydrazine as reducing agent because the better conductivity. In addition, the Pt-B/TON-N-2 catalyst exhibits better poison tolerance and two times higher methanol oxidation current density than that reported for Pt/carbon catalyst. This suggests that the Pt-B/TON-N-2 catalyst supported on TON-N-2 has promising potential applications in electrocatalyst reactions.									16	0	1	0	0	0	17			1452-3981			WOS:000316565800079

On the other hand, the reduction processes of Mn-III(L)X and Mn-III(L')(2)Cl were not so significantly affected by Cl- as those observed for their oxidation.

However, due to the direct exposure of the metal core to the electrolyte, it is vulnerable to corrosion and oxidation, which in turn reduces the catalytic stability and is becoming a major obstacle to sustainable hydrogen production. The present work addresses this issue by developing a one-step immersion-adsorption-pyrolysis strategy for synthesizing FeM alloy nanoparticles with Ndoped carbon coatings (FeM@CN) for use as electrocatalysts in the HER. The deliberately designed metal-organic framework material was used as the precursor of catalyst synthesis to achieve the carbon coatings and simultaneously the heteroatom in-situ doping for the alloy nanoparticles. The optimal FePt@CN demonstrates excellent catalytic stability and HER activity in an acidic electrolyte medium. The reactions obtain a small overpotential of 28 mV to achieve current densities of 10 mA cm(-2), which are comparable to a high-performance commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst with a much higher Pt loading. The FeRu@CN also demonstrates an outstanding performance with an overpotential of only 18 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline medium.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2468-8231			WOS:000696917900003

A key factor to be considered is the industry-scale production method, which should be cost and energy-effective, and environmentally friendly. A novel solid-phase-based methodology is introduced herein as a new approach for the mechanosynthesis of M-N-C-type catalysts. This method employs low-cost commercially available materials, is time and energy-efficient, results in no solvent/toxic waste and does not require a complex post-synthetic treatment. The liquid-assisted grinding/compression approach yielded a series of meso- and microporous Co-N-C catalysts, with excellent bifunctional activity towards oxygen evolution and reduction reactions. In-depth physical characterization confirmed that all NaCl-supported catalysts possess cross-linked sheet-like mesoporous carbon structures with high exposure of catalytically active sites. This study provides a new avenue for the large-scale production of high-performance and low-cost M-N-C materials via energy-effective and environmentally sustainable synthetic protocols.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000728957600001

This assay is based on two probes, developed herein, which generate highly fluorescent products upon carbene or oxygen atom transfer. The emission wavelength of probes 1 and 5 shift significantly (up to 90 nm) upon epoxidation, allowing detection of product at 3% conversion. Probe 7 is not fluorescent, while fluorescence emission by carbene insertion/rearrangement product 8 allows detection at less than 1% conversion. Such sensitivity allows for examination of single-bead reactions in a high throughput array format (1536 wells per plate), and provides a broad detection window ranging from single to high turnover numbers.

J	Hu, Xiao-Li; Dai, Xu-Hong; He, Xing-Quan								A N,P-co-doped 3D graphene/cobalt-embedded electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction								NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY				41	24			15236	15243		10.1039/c7nj02765f				DEC 21 2017	2017	The development of highly-efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is of great importance but remains challenging for energy applications including fuel cells and metal-air batteries. In this study, novel hybrids composed of Co nanoparticles and N,P co-doped graphene aerogels are successfully synthesized by combining a hydrothermal method with the subsequent pyrolysis procedure. Our fabricated Co/N, P-GA-900 possesses a high BET surface area (619 m(2) g(-1)) with hierarchical porous structures. For the electrocatalytic evaluation of the ORR in an alkaline medium, the onset potential (-0.04 vs. SCE) and the half-wave potential (-0.18 V vs. SCE) of the Co/N, P-GA-900 catalyst are determined to be very close to those (-0.01 and -0.16 V vs. SCE) of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. The methanol tolerance and operational stability of Co/N, P-GA-900, however, are superior to those of commercial Pt/C. The high catalytic activity and excellent durability of our as-obtained Co/N, P-GA-900 arise from hierarchical porous structures of graphene aerogels and synergetic effects between multiple types of active sites, including metallic Co nanoparticles, nitrogen and phosphorus dopants. The work presented here provides a new platform for an attractive Pt-free catalyst for fuel cells.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000417058800058

The results show that SO_2 can change the electrochemical corrosion mechanism of E690 steel in marine atmosphere. The anodic branch is transformed from weak passivation to active dissolution feature while the cathodic branch is transformed from oxygen diffusion process to mixed-control of oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, leading to great acceleration of anodic and cathodic reaction process. Meanwhile, SO_2 can significantly promote the formation of alpha-FeOOH and enrichment of Nickel and Chromium in the inner rust layer, resulting in the decrease of uniform corrosion rate and growth of corrosion pits under the rust layer. With the increase of NaHSO_3 concentration, the average corrosion rate of E690 steel within 60 days in simulated marine atmosphere is increased accordingly, and then appears a certain degree of decline when the concentration of NaHSO_3 obtained 0.03 mol/L. Meanwhile, the corrosion pits under the rust layer grew up significantly with the increase of NaHSO_3 concentration.			采用干湿交替腐蚀试验方法,结合电化学测试、锈层截面和腐蚀产物X射线衍射(X-ray diffraction,XRD)分析,研究SO_2质量分数对E690钢在模拟污染海洋大气环境中腐蚀行为的影响。结果表明,海洋大气环境中的SO_2改变了E690钢海洋大气腐蚀的电化学机制,使得极化曲线的阳极分支由弱钝化特征转变为活性溶解特征,阴极分支由氧扩散过程控制转变为氧扩散和析氢反应共同控制,因而大大促进了阳极和阴极的电化学反应过程。同时,SO_2又显著促进alpha-FeOOH的生成和Ni、Cr合金元素在内锈层中的富集,大大促进锈层的致密化,使均匀腐蚀速率逐渐减低,并促进锈层底部点蚀坑的生长。随着模拟溶液中NaHSO_3浓度的增加,E690钢在60 d内的平均腐蚀速率逐渐增加,当NaHSO_3浓度达到0.03 mol/L时,又出现一定程度的降低;同时,锈层底部的点蚀坑随NaHSO_3浓度的增加显著长大。						3	2	0	0	0	0	5			0577-6686			CSCD:5798655

In this work, a set of La2O3/C hybrids with different La2O3 loadings were prepared by chemical precipitation in alkaline solution, followed by calcination treatment. The prepared La2O3 nanoparticles with hexagonal structure covered uniformly on the carbon surface. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated different contents of covalent C-O-La bonds at the interface between the La2O3 and carbon in these hybrids. The electrochemical experiments in alkaline solution show that the catalyst with 80 wt% of La2O3 exhibits the highest electrochemical activity in catalyzing ORR and the lowest production of hydrogen peroxide among the synthesized hybrids. The remarkably enhanced ORR activity is attributed to the maximum content of the C-O-La bonds formed in the hybrid. Interestingly, the above C-O-La covalent bonds can promote the electron transfer from the supported carbon (pi electron) to the La2O3 phase, and the transferred electron can fill the unoccupied e(g) orbital splitted by the La 5d orbital of La2O3, which should be responsible for the improved ORR performance.									22	1	0	0	0	0	23			2046-2069			WOS:000382482200073

PCC6803. The highly conserved aspartate at position 9 of the mature MSP was changed to a lysine (strain MSP-D9K) to assess its role in the proposed N-terminal binding region (Eaten-Rye and Murata, 1989; Odom and Bricker, 1992). This strain accumulates normal levels of MSP, and the properties of the H2O-splitting enzyme are only slightly altered relative to the wild-type. In contrast, replacement of cysteine 20 with a serine, which is proposed to disrupt the intramolecular disulfide bridge (Tanaka et al., 1989), produces a phenotype with no detectable accumulation of MSP, despite normal levels of mRNA transcripts. Like the psbO deletion strain, the MSP-C20S mutant exhibits impaired O-2 evolution activity and a greater stability of the St state as measured by thermoluminescence. Mutation of strictly conserved aspartate 159 to asparagine (MSP-D159N) does not affect the accumulation of MSP, but causes a reduction in the H2O-oxidation activity and thermoluminescence properties intermediate between the wild-type and the psbO deletion strain. In addition, we report upon improved methods for obtaining oxygen-evolving membranes from mutant cells.									55	1	2	0	51	0	58			0006-2960			WOS:A1994PT48500023	7947781

In this work, in-depth transmission electron microscopy characterization reveals the formation of an Fe/Fe3O4 core-shell structure when iron NPs were oxidized at room temperature. More importantly, we present the first atomically resolved dynamical images showing the redox reactions in Fe/oxide NPs at high temperature (400-600 degrees C). The real-time videos show the unambiguous evidence of the reduction and incorporation of oxygen species along the specific interfaces, leading to the reduction of Fe3O4 to FeO and oxidation of Fe to Fe3O4, which are further investigated based on the theoretical calculations. Meanwhile, it is found that the passive Fe3O4 shell may provide the oxygen ions for the further oxidation of the Fe core at high temperature. These findings contribute to a comprehensive scenario for the structural evolution in metal/oxide nanostructures for improved device design and modeling.									17	3	0	0	3	0	20			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000448752100038

A reduction in system costs is essential for competitiveness with other chemical energy storage systems. A large share of costs is currently attributed to the electrolyte, which can be significantly reduced by production based on vanadium pentoxide (V2O5). In this study, the dissolution kinetics of V(2)O(5)in diluted sulfuric acid and commercial vanadium electrolyte (VE) is determined. The low solubility of V(2)O(5)in sulfuric acid can be overcome by partially using VE with a state of charge of -50% as solvent. In this way, a complete dissolution of V(2)O(5)is possible within approximate to 10 min to achieve the desired vanadium concentration of 1.6 mol L-1. Moreover, the electrochemical reduction of an electrolyte containing VO(2)(+)coupled with the oxygen evolution reaction at the anode is investigated. For these consecutive steps, an electrical energy demand of 1.69 kWh kg(-1)is required to reach a state of charge of -50%. Finally, both processes are integrated into a plant concept for continuous electrolyte production.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000567271600001

The unresolved sub-grid scale motion is modelled using the dynamic Smagorinsky model in combination with the Probability Density Function method. It is shown that the Large Eddy Simulation method is capable of reproducing the characteristic shape of the reaction zone as well as the non-linear evolution of the total heat release rate in a bluff-body stabilised combustor. Commonly used measures for quantifying the variation of the total heat release rate are evaluated and examined in the present flow configuration of a lean-premixed ethylene-air flame. It was found that formaldehyde-based measures do not appropriately reproduce the amplitude and phase of the total heat release rate. A significantly improved correlation was achieved by employing the product of the mass fractions of molecular oxygen (O-2) and the ketenyl radical (HCCO) as a means of characterising the variation of the total heat release rate.					10th International Symposium on Engineering Turbulence Modelling and Measurements (ETMM)10th International Symposium on Engineering Turbulence Modelling and Measurements (ETMM)	SEP 17-19, 2014SEP 17-19, 2014		Marbella, SPAINMarbella, SPAIN	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1386-6184	1573-1987		WOS:000362364500017

Owing to their various compositions and tunable electronic properties, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have the great potential to realize high-efficiency catalysts for ORR. Here, various 3R-phase dichalcogenides of group VB and VIB transition metals (MX2, M = Nb, Ta, Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) are investigated for ORR catalysts by using density functional theory calculations. The computed over-potentials of group VB TMDs are much less than those of group VIB TMDs. For group VB TMDs, a volcano-type plot of ORR catalytic activity is established on the adsorption energies of *OH, and NbS2 and TaTe2 exhibit best ORR activity with an over-potential of 0.54 V. To achieve even better activity, strain engineering is performed to tune ORR catalytic activity, and the minimum over-potential of 0.43 V can be realized. We further demonstrate that the shift of p orbital center of surface chalcogen elements under strain is responsible for tuning the catalytic activity of TMDs.									33	6	0	0	1	0	33			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000463003600027

Here, we unravel the ensemble effect of catalytically active sites for promotion of CRR while suppressing hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs). We design a 2D/2D hybrid consisting of an ordered assembly of nickel-rich Ni-Mn layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets (NSs) and oxygen vacancies (OVs)-rich Mn3O4 (OVs-Mn3O4) NSs. On its own, Ni-Mn LDH demonstrates high CRR selectivity but mediocre CRR efficiency, whereas OVs-Mn3O4 gives a higher efficiency but poorer selectivity. The 2D/2D hybrid inherits advantages from both components, attaining high CRR selectivity and markedly higher efficiency than Ni-MnLDH and OVs-Mn3O4. Calculations and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) measurements reveal that nickel sites in the 2D/2D hybrid activate CO2 to generate CO2 center dot- via a one-electron injection, whereas OVs in OVs-Mn3O4 promote light harvesting and charge transport without activating unwanted HERs.									4	0	0	0	0	0	3				2666-3864		WOS:000760198000012

However, the high cost of Pt prevents its large-scale use in ORR. Reducing the dosage of Pt is the key to cut cost and increase the extent of its application range. The two-dimensional MoS(2)is a promising candidate and can be modified by doping methods to achieve ORR catalytic activity comparable to that of Pt. It can also be set as a cocatalyst for Pt so as to reduce the dosage of Pt. But questions on the more feasible option is the current research topic being explored. To understand the importance of MoS(2)in ORR applications, first-principle calculations were carried out. Compared with pure Pt and pristine MoS2, the ORR properties of doped MoS(2)and Pt-deposited MoS(2)were analyzed. Finally, we found that MoS(2)performs better as a cocatalyst for Pt since it greatly reduced the Pt dosage and obtained an appropriate performance. Thus, this study can provide a reference for future studies on MoS(2)in ORR applications.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000562010300032

Microwave-assisted synthesis of a nanoamorphous (Ni-0.8,Fe-0.2) oxide oxygen-evolving electrocatalyst containing only "fast" sites								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				5	23			11661	11670		10.1039/c7ta00151g				JUN 21 2017	2017	Nickel-iron oxyhydroxides (Ni1-xFexOOH) are non-precious metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that have high efficiency in alkaline media. It has been suggested that the layered-double hydroxide (LDH) crystal structure of Ni0.8Fe0.2OOH contains two types of catalytic sites, "fast" Fe sites and "slow" Ni sites, which may limit the overall activity because only 20% of the catalytic surface is highly active. Herein, we report a facile microwave-assisted synthesis route of creating a nanoamorphous nickel-iron oxide electrocatalyst that contains only "fast" catalytic sites. Benchmarking experiments on flat electrodes (roughness factors <1.4) showed that the microwave-assisted, nanoamorphous (Ni-0.8,Fe-0.2) oxide had a low OER overpotential of 286 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). We measured the kinetic rate constant of the active sites directly with the surface interrogation mode of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SI-SECM). We show that the microwave-assisted, nanoamorphous (Ni-0.8, Fe-0.2) oxide has only one type of catalytic site with an OER kinetic rate constant of 1.9 s(-1) per site. We compared this to a crystalline Ni0.8Fe0.2OOH that was synthesized via electrochemical conditioning of crystalline Ni-0.8:Fe-0.2 oxide, and verified that the Ni0.8Fe0.2OOH contained two types of catalytic sites - "fast" sites with an OER rate constant of 1.3 s(-1) per site and "slow" sites with an OER rate constant of 0.05 s(-1) per site. The percentage of "fast" sites in the crystalline Ni0.8Fe0.2OOH was well matched to the total iron atom content, while 100% of the sites were "fast" in the microwave-assisted, nanoamorphous (Ni-0.8,Fe-0.2) oxide.									21	1	0	0	0	0	21			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000403228200023

These olivine xenocrysts are large (600-1600 mu m), usually rounded and embayed, with well-developed cracks. Their cores have high and uniform forsterite (Fo) contents (88-91), similar to the peridotitic olivine entrained by regional Cenozoic basalts. Their rims have much lower Fo contents (74-82), comparable to phenocrysts (72-81) in the host basalts. These characteristics reveal that the zoned olivine has been disaggregated from mantle xenoliths and thus can be used to trace the underlying lithospheric mantle at the time of basaltic magmatism. The olivine cores have high oxygen isotope compositions (delta O-18(SMOW) = 5.9-7.0 parts per thousand) relative to the normal mantle value, suggesting that the Early Cretaceous lithospheric mantle was enriched and metasomatized mainly by melts/fluids released from subducted oceanic crust that had experienced low-temperature hydrothermal alteration. Preservation of zoned olivine xenocrysts in the Early Cretaceous basalts indicates that olivine-melt/fluid reaction could have been prevalent in the lithospheric mantle as an important mechanism for the transformation from old refractory (high-Mg) peridotitic mantle to young, fertile (low-Mg), and enriched lithospheric mantle during the early Mesozoic.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0016-7606	1943-2674		WOS:000588959000008

We report 5 cases. The diagnosis of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema due to pulmonary capillary leak syndrome after influenza A (H1N1) virus infection was obtained by a medical committee of 6 physicians of our intensive care unit (intensive care unit physicians). Cases of 2009 H1N1 influenza were confirmed by testing nasal aspirates or combined nasal and throat swabs with the use of a real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay at Tunisian national laboratory. All 5 patients with a confirmed influenza A (H1N1) virus infection have respiratory distress. All patients have a respiratory distress with lung crackles on auscultation of one or both lungs and with alveolar pulmonary edema on the chest roentgenograms. The cardiogenic nature of pulmonary edema was ruled out in all cases by a transthoracic echocardiography showing normal systolic and diastolic functions. All patients were treated with oxygen +/- noninvasive ventilation (NIV); oseltamivir and steroids in addition to empiric antibiotics were commenced. Bacterial cultures of blood, urine, and sputum and serologic reaction for atypical respiratory pathogens were negative in all cases. Evolution was marked by a good outcome in all patients. Infection by influenza A (H1N1) virus can leads to acute respiratory distress due to pulmonary capillary leak syndrome. Evolution is usually favorable under oxygen +/- NIV; oseltamivir and steroids in addition to empiric antibiotics were commenced.									7	0	0	0	5	1	7			0735-6757	1532-8171		WOS:000209526100011	20825864

This strategy possesses a direct reaction route of oxygen-containing compounds from bio-oils depending on catalysts precursors and reaction conditions. The active catalytic species were formed in situ through the high-temperature decomposition of oil-soluble metal precursors followed by sulfidation in water-in-oil sulfur-containing emulsions. Unsupported NiMoS catalysts were found to provide 100% guaiacol conversion at 320-380 degrees C and 5 MPa CO pressure. Reaction routes and mechanisms for hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol were proposed. Ni:Mo= 1:3 and sulfur content of 1.2-1.5 wt% favor higher cyclohexene selectivity decreases at low temperature and short reaction time (30-40 wt% water content, CO pressure of 5 MPa). The catalysts were found to be reusable at least 6 cycles in the sulfur-assisted hydrodeoxygenation of guaiacol with maintaining conversion, and active component evolution was studied.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000803739100004

In-situ Raman analysis reveals that, during the OER process, surface reconstitution of the sulfide catalyst occurs, forming oxyhydroxides component. The latter is considered as the real OER catalytic phase. This study advances the design of efficient and durable nonprecious bifunctional catalysts for rechargeable zinc-air batteries.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000729593100001

In the presence of low concentrations of carboxylic acids, current densities changed approximately linearly with the acid concentrations. Furthermore, when the current densities were plotted as a function of the chemical oxygen demand, a similar response was observed for all the investigated acids with the exception of oxalic acid. For high carboxylic acid concentrations, the linear variation is often loosen and different behaviors are observed depending on the nature of the acid and on the value of the applied working potential. Smaller increases of current densities were observed in water solutions of NaCl as a result of the chlorides oxidation to active chlorine. The effect of pH, boron doping level, BDD pretreatment, and of the nature of the supporting electrolyte on the amperometric response of carboxylic acids was also studied in detail. Some theoretical considerations were briefly presented in order to rationalize the observed behaviors.									12	0	0	0	0	1	12			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000328166300014

However, its high cost and the mixed potential issue have been obstacles for commercialization. Herein, we report a new Pt-based catalyst of two-dimensionally layered platinum ditelluride (2D PtTe2) with mixed layer orientation, termed M-PtTe2. This material constitutes vertically- and horizontally aligned 2D PtTe2 layers, which synergistically boost the ORR reaction; the former promotes O-2 adsorption and electron transfer, while the latter boosts O-O bond breaking and O-H bond coupling. The M-PtTe2 synthesized on nanostructured carbon papers significantly surpasses the ORR performances of commercial Pt/C, yielding 2.4-times higher mass activity in half-cell and 2-times higher maximum power density in actual devices. Furthermore, it exhibits extremely low alcohol adsorption energies, unveiling unprecedented suitability for alcohol tolerant DLFCs. This new understanding of the role of the 2D layer orientation in ORR kinetics and thermodynamics suggests useful catalyst design principles.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2380-8195			WOS:000707987500012

Elucidating the Composition-Activity Relationships in Molybdenum Nitride Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction								CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS				32	7			2946	2960		10.1021/acs.chemmater.9b05212				APR 14 2020	2020	Molybdenum nitride (Mo-N) catalysts have shown promising activity and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acid. However, the effect of oxygen (O) incorporation (from synthesis, catalysis, or exposure to air) on their activity remains elusive. Here, we use reactive sputtering to synthesize three compositions of thin-film catalysts and use extensive materials characterization to investigate the depth-dependent structure and incorporated O. We show that the as-deposited Mo-N films are highly oxidized both at the surface (>30% O) and in the bulk (3-21% O) and that the ORR performance is strongly correlated with the bulk structure and composition. Activity for 4e(-) ORR is highest for compositions with the highest N/O and N/Mo ratio. Furthermore, H2O2 production for the films with moderate O content is comparable to or higher than the most H2O2 -selective nonprecious metal catalysts in acidic electrolyte, on a moles per mass or surface area of catalyst basis. Density functional theory provides insight into the energetics of O incorporation and vacancy formation, and we hypothesize that activity trends with O/N ratios can be traced to the varying crystallite phases and their interactions with ORR adsorbates. This work demonstrates the prevalence and significance of O in metal nitride electrocatalysts and motivates further investigation into the role of O in other nonprecious metal materials.									31	2	0	0	1	0	31			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000526394000025

The astrophysical P-30(p,gamma)S-31 reaction rate uncertainty at ONe nova temperatures (0.10 < T < 0.35 GK) spans several orders of magnitude through which the predicted amount of ejected Si-30 can vary by a factor of 100. By measuring triton momenta from the P-31(He-3,t)S-31 reaction at 20 MeV, the energies of P-30 +p resonances in the Gamow window for ONe novae have been determined to better than +/- 3 keV, and two new resonances at E-c.m.=194.0(25) and 266.4(27) keV that likely dominate the P-30(p,gamma)S-31 rate for 0.08 < T < 0.25 GK have been resolved. A resulting increase in the experimentally determined P-30(p,gamma)S-31 reaction rate puts it in accord with Hauser-Feshbach statistical model estimates for 0.08 < T < 0.40 GK, supporting conclusions drawn from ONe nova model studies that employed a Hauser-Feshbach rate.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			0556-2813	1089-490X		WOS:000251327000013

By thermal analysis (DTG), a mass loss corresponding to volatile components and water, equivalent to 29.22% of the total mass was observed. This value is in accordance with the mass loss of the compound when it was fired at 900degreesC toward the Sm(2)O(3) oxide. With the DTG program a process of thermodecomposition in multisteps, was observed, corresponding to the loss of water (up to 200degreesC), evolution of oxygen gas from the peroxide compound and a partial decomposition to CO(2) (200-550degreesC) and a second evolution Of CO(2) (from 500 to 900degreesC). This final evolution of CO(2) probably came from the intermediary compound Sm(2)O(2)CO(3). By microanalyses the carbon and hydrogen contents were 4.7 and 1.0%, respectively. In summary, the analytical data collected allowed one to conclude that the stoichiometric formula for the studied compound is Sm(2)O(2)(CO(3))(2)(.)2H(2)O. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

It is known that materials affect wine composition through releasing of tannins, elementals and allowing different level of oxygen permeation. To monitor how the composition of a red wine was influenced by the contact with different kind of material, a Sangiovese red wine from the 2018 harvest was aged for one-year simultaneously in six different 5 hL tank materials including stainless steel, epoxy-coated concrete, uncoated concrete, raw earthenware, new and used oak wood. The registered differences were described through kinetic modeling of some wine's chemical and physical parameters. In particular, the one-year evolution of the dissolved oxygen, redox potential and phenolic composition of the wines showed significant differences according to the tank material. Like the oak barrels, the raw earthenware amphorae and uncoated concrete tanks enhanced the polymerisation of the phenolic fraction of the wine. Instead, the stainless steel and epoxy-coated concrete proved to be the most chemically inert materials as they showed the least variability of redox potential and the lowest degree of color evolution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1438-2377	1438-2385		WOS:000760742900001

The fabricated nanocomposite was characterized successfully using several analytical techniques. The fabricated nanocomposite was used as electrocatalyst for water splitting, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in 1.0 M KOH solution. The fabricated nanocomposite shows highly porous nature with high surface area about to 372.32 m(2)/g. The catalytic results show, the lower limiting overpotential during the ORR (eta(lim) = 0.33 V) and more positive half wave potential activity than that of commercial platinum on carbon (Pt/C) catalyst. Moreover, the Co-3(PO4)(2)-NC exhibit excellent catalytic activity toward OER, with an overpotential of 350 mV at 10 mA cm(2) in 1.0 M KOH solution and a relatively low Tafel slope of 60.7 mV dec. In addition, the fabricated catalyst possesses excellent reusability, long term stability with fast electron transfer during the catalytic reactions. These outcomes revealed that the fabricated nanocomposites can be used as low-cost, efficient catalyst for water splitting ORR and OER in metal-air batteries and fuel cells. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

A recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiment showed that the H2O molecule adsorbed on rutile TiO2(110) surface could decompose under ultraviolet illumination (Tan, S. J.; et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2012, 134, 9978). The underlying reaction mechanism is now examined by our GGA+U study, in which the oxidation of the H2O molecule by both free and trapped holes has been carefully investigated. It is found that the transfer of the hole trapped at the bridge oxygen to the molecule is hindered by the mismatch between the energy and spatial symmetry of the trapped hole orbital and the highest occupied molecule orbital of H2O. The entire oxidation reaction has a high energy barrier and is barely exothermic. In contrast, the oxidation of the molecule by the free hole is energetically more favorable. The free hole is transferred to the H2O molecule via the in-plane oxygen atom when the molecule stays in the transient dissociation state. This mechanism may also be applicable to the photooxidation of other R OH type molecules adsorbed on the rutile TiO2(110) surface.									36	3	0	0	4	0	37			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000330417100033

Great progress has been made in developing non-noble-metal nanocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the past decade, but non-noble-metal OER nanocatalysts have not been explored as electrocatalytic labels for immunosensing. Herein, we report NiCoO2@CeO2 nanoboxes (NBs) as novel electrocatalytic labels for ultrasensitive immunosensing based on the excellent OER activity of NiCoO2@CeO2 NBs in a neutral solution. The synthesis of NiCoO2@CeO2 NBs involves Ni2+ exchange and heat treatment of ZIF-67 nanocubes to produce NiCoO2 NBs, followed by the growth of CeO2 nanoparticles on the surface of NiCoO2 NBs. The NiCoO2@CeO2 NBs offer superior OER activity to NiCoO2 NBs because of the synergetic effect between NiCoO2 NBs and CeO2 nanoparticles. The formation of ester-like bridging between CeO2 and the carboxylic groups of antibody enables direct immobilization of the antibody on the NiCoO2@CeO2 surface. A sandwich-type electrochemical immunosensor using NiCoO2@CeO2 NBs as electrocatalytic labels features a broad linear range for interleukin-6 detection from 2.5 x 10(-5) to 10 ng mL(-1), with a low detection limit of 7 fg mL(-1). Our work lays the foundation for developing electrochemical immunosensors and aptasensors based on non-noble-metal OER electrocatalysts.									15	0	0	0	1	0	14			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000600095600073	33231425

An ambient pressure XPS (AP-XPS) endstation that is capable of detecting high kinetic energy photoelectrons (7 keV) at a pressure up to 110 Torr has been constructed and commissioned. Additionally, we have deployed a "dip & pull" method to create a stable nanometers-thick aqueous electrolyte on platinum working electrode surface. Combining the newly constructed AP-XPS system, "dip & pull" approach, with a "tender" X-ray synchrotron source (2 keV-7 keV), we are able to access the interface between liquid and solid dense phases with photoelectrons and directly probe important phenomena occurring at the narrow solid-liquid interface region in an electrochemical system. Using this approach, we have performed electrochemical oxidation of the Pt electrode at an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential. Under this potential, we observe the formation of both Pt2+ and Pt4+ interfacial species on the Pt working electrode in situ. We believe this thin-film approach and the use of "tender" AP-XPS highlighted in this study is an innovative new approach to probe this key solid-liquid interface region of electrochemistry.									196	2	0	0	7	0	197			2045-2322			WOS:000354108600001	25950241

Here, we describe the use of a simple hydrothermal process to successfully synthesize novel nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) anchored on NiFe layered double hydroxide sheets (N-GQDs/NiFe-LDH). Structural, morphological, and crystalline phase characteristics were confirmed by applying SEM, TEM, XPS, and XRD studies. These analyses clearly showed the formation of the N-GQDs/NiFe-LDH composite with a hierarchical nanosheet structure possessing higher surface area values and a wide range of pores (10-180 nm). Further study showed that the as-prepared N-GQDs/NiFe-LDH composite exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity for the OER in alkaline solution, affording small overpotential of 279 and 300 mV at current densities of 20 and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively, a low Tafel slope of 47 mV dec(-1), and satisfactory stability. The outstanding reactive kinetics outperformed those of most previously reported transition-metal-based catalysts. The excellent OER catalytic activity for the N-GQDs/NiFe-LDH composite is attributed to the synergistic effect of the N-GQDs and NiFe-LDH, the existence of pyridinic-N and graphitic-N on the N-GQDs, and the hierarchical nanosheet and its porous structure. This work provides a new strategy for designing and fabricating novel carbon-based LDH composites.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000582432400014

By properly choosing or designing the host material to stabilize the active sites, host-engineering strategy is commonly applied for the preparation of quasimolecular heterogeneous catalysts. Here, by doping the metal-organic framework (MOF) Co-BPDC with 4-(4'-formylphenyl)benzoic acid, ultrathin nano sheets with an aldehyde group-modified surface were facially produced. Upon the addition of ethylenediamine, the surface aldehyde group was converted into imine groups in situ. At this stage, the Co-BPDC nanosheet still had relatively poor catalytic activity in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). After metalation with Fe3+ under ambient conditions, the catalytic activity was greatly enhanced for the resulting nanosheet. With a surface Fe content of 2.87 wt %, the observed electrochemical overpotential and Tafel slope for the Co-BPDC nanosheet in OER decreased to 291 mV and 38 mV/decade, respectively. Meanwhile, the nanosheet catalyst also showed moderate catalytic stability. By taking advantage of the ultrathin nanosheet, the catalytic active Fe sites were immobilized on the nanosheet by the surface imine ligands. This strategy enables the economical and facial production of an atomically dispersed metal catalyst in a large scale under ambient conditions. With the easily accessible and modifiable large surface, the ultrathin MOF nanosheet is an ideal host material for anchoring active metal sites after surface modification.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2574-0970		WOS:000874909900001

The main challenge of electrochemical water splitting is in the development of low-cost earth-abundant electrocatalysts to enable their large-scale applications in industry. Two-dimensional (2D) materials have been developed as promising electrocatalysts due to their abundant exposed active sites, high surface area and fast transfer ability of electrons. However, currently, there is a lack of review work in literature elucidating the most recent advances on the research and development of 2D precious-free electrocatalysts and their state-of-the-art performances in water splitting. Herein, the authors present a review of recent progress of development on diverse exfoliation methods for synthesizing multi-category 2D non-precious metal-based (N PM B) electrocatalysts to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. The leading methods are composed of guest ions or molecules-assisted, auxiliary force-assisted, electrochemical-assisted exfoliation and additional exfoliation for fabricating these 2D NPMB nanosheets, including transition-metal dichalcogenides, oxides, carbides, nitrides, layered double hydroxides, metal-organic frameworks and mono-elemental materials.

A layer of iridium oxide (IrO2) and tantalum oxide (Ta2O5) coated on a titanium (Ti) substrate electrode is active for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic solution. Herein, we used a porous Ti felt composed of microfibers as a conductive substrate for the IrO2-Ta2O5 electrocatalytic layer. The effect of the Ti substrates and the calcination temperature on the electrocatalytic activity for OER was investigated by cyclic voltammetry in an acidic sulfate solution. The results show that the IrO2-Ta2O5 layer on the porous Ti felt with a large surface area was more active than the layer on the conventional Ti plate. The electrocatalytic activity of IrO2-Ta2O5 layers was maximized by calcination at 350 degrees C and decreased by increasing the calcination temperature with the decrease of the double-layer capacitance (C-dl), which is recognized as an electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). The IrO2-Ta2O5 thin layer on the Ti felt was amorphous in the measurement of X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The amorphous layer was confirmed to have rare cracks, larger ECSA, and higher catalytic activity for OER. The overpotential required to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) was only 0.27 V. The constant current was the Faradaic current for water oxidation to evolve O-2.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			2574-0962			WOS:000537656400054

However, the oxygen vacancy defects in TiO2 may serve as recombination centers, hampering the separation and transfer of photo-generated charges. Here, we present a strategy of in-situ depositing noble-metal (M = Ag, Au or Pt) nanoparticles (NPs) on defective 3D TiO2 hierarchical spheres (THS) with large surface area through the redox reaction between metal ions in solution and the electrons trapped at oxygen vacancies in THS. The oxygen vacancies at the THS surface are consumed, resulting in direct contact between TiO2 and noble-metal NPs, while the other oxygen vacancies in the bulk are retained to promote visible light absorption. The noble-metal NPs with well-controlled size and distribution throughout the porous hierarchical structure not only facilitate the generation of electron hole pairs in THS due to the effect of surface plasmon-induced resonance energy transfer (SPRET) from noble-metal NPs to TiO2, but also expediate the electron transfer from TiO2 to noble-metal NPs due to the Schottky junction at the TiO2/M interface. Therefore, THS-M shows improved photocatalytic performance in water splitting compared to THS. The optimum performance is achieved on THS-Pt (13.16 mmol h(-1)g(-1)) under full-spectrum (UV-Vis) irradiation but on THS-Au (1.49 mmol h(-1)g(-1)) under visible-light irradiation. The underlying mechanisms are proposed from the surface plasmon resonance of noble-metal NPs as well as the Schottky junction at the TiO2/M interface. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Multiple heteroatom-doped carbons have aroused extensive interests due to the synergistic effect of dopants and thus multi-functional active sites. Herein, through a simple "mix-andpyrolyze" strategy, the low-cost and nontoxic zinc pyrithione and phytic acid are explored to fabricate nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur-tridoped porous carbon materials, featuring a honeycomb-like nanosheet structure with a high surface area of 711.6 m(2)/g and high-level dopants including especially 6.61 at % phosphorus. In this "complicated" doping system, 95.2% N exists as graphitic and pyridinic moieties with 92.2 at% phosphorus as P-C bond, all of which are desired active sites for electrocatalysis. Accordingly, the newly-designed carbon material shows superior alkaline ORR performance with a half-wave potential of 0.91 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) compared with that of 20% Pt/C (0.87 V) as well as excellent acidic ORR activity. Meantime, its HER performances in both acidic and alkaline conditions are comparable to the benchmarkers. The outstanding bifunctional activity in tri-doped carbons can be attributed to the multiple active sites, large surface area, abundant porous structure and excellent charge-transfer ability.

Regulation of photosynthesis for nitrogen fixation studied by chlorophyll fluorescence kinetic microscopy								PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				135	4			2120	2133		10.1104/pp.104.045963				AUG 2004	2004	We investigated interactions between photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation in the non-heterocystous marine cyanobacterium Trichodesmium IMS101 at the single-cell level by two-dimensional (imaging) microscopic measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence kinetics. Nitrogen fixation was closely associated with the appearance of cells with high basic fluorescence yield (F-0), termed bright cells. In cultures aerated with normal air, both nitrogen fixation and bright cells appeared in the middle of the light phase. In cultures aerated with 5% oxygen, both processes occurred at a low level throughout most of the day. Under 50% oxygen, nitrogen fixation commenced at the beginning of the light phase but declined soon afterwards. Rapid reversible switches between fluorescence levels were observed, which indicated that the elevated F-0 of the bright cells originates from reversible uncoupling of the photosystem II (PSII) antenna from the PSII reaction center. Two physiologically distinct types of bright cells were observed. Type I had about double F-0 compared to the normal F-0 in the dark phase and a PSII activity, measured as variable fluorescence (F-v = F-m - F-0), similar to normal non-diazotrophic cells. Correlation of type I cells with nitrogen fixation, oxygen concentration, and light suggests that this physiological state is connected to an up-regulation of the Mehler reaction, resulting in oxygen consumption despite functional PSII. Type II cells had more than three times the normal F-0 and hardly any PSII activity measurable by variable fluorescence. They did not occur under low-oxygen concentrations, but appeared under high-oxygen levels outside the diazotrophic period, suggesting that this state represents a reaction to oxidative stress not necessarily connected to nitrogen fixation. In addition to the two high-fluorescence states, cells were observed to reversibly enter a low-fluorescence state. This occurred mainly after a cell went through its bright phase and may represent a fluorescence-quenching recovery phase.									47	0	0	0	41	0	50			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000223482400026	15299119

However, oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) exhibit poor catalytic performance due to the high binding energy between the active site and the adsorbed species. Here, we propose a feasible strategy to modulate the binding strength of the oxygenated species on the graphitic nanosheet by introducing metal substrate gating. Density functional theory calculation results reveal the remarkable enhancement of ORR performance with the confinement of the Ni(111) surface, and the overpotentials for six different transition metal (TM) atom-doped pentagonloctagonlpentagon (51 815) graphene (TM@5 vertical bar 8 vertical bar 5G) systems on the Ni(111) surface can be significantly reduced, particularly for the case of Co@5 vertical bar 8 vertical bar 5G (from 0.98 to 0.33 V). This is mainly attributed to the electron coupling between the metal substrate and TM@5 vertical bar 8 vertical bar 5G. Moreover, the catalytic activity can be well modulated by adjusting d-band center of TM atoms, leading to an ideal energy level of the d-band center for TM@5 vertical bar 8 vertical bar 5G on the Ni substrate (-1.48 eV), at which ORB, can achieve the highest performance.									20	1	1	0	2	0	20			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000459223200047

The degradation rate, instantaneous current efficiency （ICE） and chemical oxygen demand （COD） were determined for the different electrodes. It is found that the reaction rate of the electrochemical oxidation of methyl orange on the different anodes follows the first-order reaction kinetics, and the apparent rate constants at 25 ℃ are 0.147 and 2.43℃10~(-2) min~(-1) for Ti/SnO_2＋Sb_2O_3 and Ti/SnO_2＋Sb_2O_3/PbO_2 anodes, respectively. When the degradation has lasted for 30 min with the Ti/SnO2＋Sb2O3 anode, the concentration of methyl orange decreases from 0.305 mmol/L to 4.89* 10^-3 mmol/L and the conversion rate of methyl orange is 98.4%, while decreases only to 0.14 mmol/L with the Ti/SnO_＋Sb_2O_3/PbO_2 anode at same conditions and the conversion is 55.0%. ICE for the Ti/SnO_2＋Sb_2O_3 anode is more than that for the Ti/SnO_2＋Sb_2O_3 PbO_2 anode. The Ti/SnO_2＋Sb_2O_3 anode with a higher oxygen evolution potential presents high reaction rate and current efficiency for the elimination of methyl orange.			分别以TESnO_2＋Sb_2O_3和Ti／SnO~(2＋)Sb_2O_3／PbO_2电极为阳极进行甲基橙的电化学氧化，研究了两种金属氧化物阳极上甲基橙氧化降解过程的反应速率、电流效率及COD的变化．实验结果表明，两种金属氧化物阳极都能有效氧化降解甲基橙，氧化反应符合一级反应动力学规律，在TESnO_2＋Sb_2O_3和Ti／SnO~(2＋)Sb_2O_3／PbO_2电极上甲基橙氧化降解过程的表观速率常数分别为0．148和2．43*10~(-2)min~(-1)以Ti／SnO_2＋Sb_2O_3为阳极电解30min，甲基橙的浓度从初始时的0．305mmol／L降至4．89*10~(-3)mmol／L，甲基橙的转化率达98．4％；在Ti/SnO~(2＋)Sb_2O_3／PbO2电极上，相同电解时间下甲基橙的浓度只降至0．14mmol／L，转化率为55．0％．对不同电极上甲基橙电化学氧化过程电流效率的研究表明，TESnO_2＋Sb_2O_3电极的电流效率明显高于Ti／SnO_2＋Sb_2O_3／PBO_2电极．Ti/SnO_2＋Sb_2O_3电极的反应速率大、电流效率高主要源于其较高的析氧电位．						0	0	0		0	0	0			1009-606X			CSCD:3039671

Herein, we designed a novel porous graphene material containing only pyridinic N (PNG), exhibiting superior electrocatalytic ORR activity when it is supported on metal substrates. We have considered both Co (0001) and Ni (111) as the substrates to investigate the ORR process of PNG from density functional theory methods. Our researches have illustrated the optimal active site for ORR is the C atom next to the pyridinic N, locating at the hollow site with respect to the metal substrate. By introducing Co (0001) and Ni (111) substrates, the ORR electrocatalytic performance of PNG have been effectively enhanced with the lowest calculated overpotential of 0.41 V, which originated from the electronic coupling between the metal substrate and the C atoms of PNG. Finally, the ORR activity could be further enhanced under the tensile strain. Our study provided valuable guidance for the design of two-dimensional graphene-based heterojunction materials as efficient ORR electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000750883400063

Their thermal stability, electronic properties, and catalytic activities can be controlled via interactions between the single-metal atom center and neighboring heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. Due to the atomic dispersion of the active catalytic centers, the amount of metal required for catalysis can be decreased, thus offering new possibilities to control the selectivity of a given transformation as well as to improve catalyst turnover frequencies and turnover numbers. This review aims to comprehensively summarize the synthesis of Fe-SACs with a focus on anchoring single atoms (SA) on carbon/graphene supports. The characterization of these advanced materials using various spectroscopic techniques and their applications in diverse research areas are described. When applicable, mechanistic investigations conducted to understand the specific behavior of Fe-SACs-based catalysts are highlighted, including the use of theoretical models.									38	0	0	0	2	0	38			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000718326200010	34644065

However, most of the energy storage materials are facing challenges in redox kinetics and cyclic stability. Iron-doped manganese oxide attracts raising attention due to its non-toxicity, low cost, and high energy capacity over 800 degrees C. However, there are few investigations on the reversibility enhancement of the redox reaction from the microstructural-evolution-mechanism point of view. Herein, bixbyite-type (Mn0.8Fe0.2)(2)O-3 is synthesized and extruded into honeycomb units, which can maintain an 85% initial capacity after 100 redox cycles. It is also found that a self-assembled core-shell MnFe2O4@Mn2.7Fe0.3O4 structure forms during the reduction step, and then transforms into a homogeneous solid solution of (Mn0.8Fe0.2)(2)O-3 in the following oxidation step. During the reduction step, shells are formed spontaneously from the Mn2.7Fe0.3O4 with the MnFe2O4 as cores due to the lower surface energy, which facilitates the oxygen adsorption and dissociation during subsequent oxidation step. Through the density functional theory calculation, it is revealed that the lower formation energy of oxygen vacancies in the shell contributes to the improvement of oxygen diffusion rate. This study can provide a guideline to design prospective materials for high-temperature TCES.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000662309400001	34139101

This review proposes that electrochemical energy conversion could set the foundation for such an energy system. It further suggests that a simple switch from an acid to a base membrane coupled with innovative cell designs may lead to a new era of affordable electrochemical devices, including fuel cells, electrolyzers, solar hydrogen generators, and redox flow batteries, for which recent progress is discussed using the authors' work as examples. It also notes that electrochemical energy engineering will likely become a vibrant subdiscipline of chemical engineering and a fertile ground for chemical engineering innovation. To realize this vision, it is necessary to incorporate fundamental electrochemistry and electrochemical engineering principles into the chemical engineering curriculum.									60	4	0	0	3	0	62			1947-5438		978-0-8243-5205-9	WOS:000340198000021	24702299

Simultaneous deposition of the three metals has been possible, over an initial platinum deposit. Control of Co:Ni ratio in solution and deposition potential have permitted to prepare nanometric PtCoNi films with different composition and morphology. Modification of the properties of the films as a consequence of a gradual substitution of Co by Ni has been analyzed. The presence of Ni into the deposits drastically affects the magnetic properties of the films, by controlling the morphology and crystalline structure of the deposits, because the partial substitution of Co by Ni favours the evolution from hcp Co phase to fcc Pt phase. Catalytic properties of the PtCoNi films respect to the oxygen reduction reaction were also clearly dependent on the Ni amount into the deposits: substitution of some Co by Ni improves (for low Ni content) or worsens (for increasing Ni content) the properties of PtCo films.

Both types of corrosion reactions can be examined gasvolumetrically. The corrosion reactions of all examined metal pigments can be inhibited more or less by addition of styrene-maleic acid-acrylate copolymers with different acrylate monomers (ethyl- n-butyl- and n-hexylacrylate as well as n-dodecyl- and n-octadecylmethacrylate). A surprising result is that the oxygen corrosion of the brass pigment is inhibited more effectively by the copolymers when compared to the copper pigment.With respect to the interaction of the metals with the copolymers there are two groups of metal pigments. The first group is aluminium pigment only; the corrosion inhibiting effect of the copolymers increases with increasing side chain length of the acrylate monomer. The second group consists of the base zinc pigment and the more noble copper pigment; the corrosion inhibiting effect of the copolymers decreases with increasing side chain length of the acrylate monomer. These connections between the chemical composition of the copolymers and their corrosion inhibiting effect can be correlated mathematically with the help of potential functions.									3	3	0	0	0	0	6			0947-5117	1521-4176		WOS:000089459700005		
J	Siefermann-Harms, D; Michel, J M; Collard, F								Carotenoid transformations underlying the blue absorbance change in flashed leaves during the induction of oxygen evolution.								Biochimica et biophysica acta				589	2			313	23						1980-Feb-08	1980	The blue absorbance change occurring in flashed bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) leaves when exposed to continuous light (first observed by Strasser; Strasser, R.J. (1973) Arch. Int. Physiol. Biochem. 81, 935--955) is caused by the conversion of the following xanthophylls: violaxanthine leads to antheraxanthine leads to zeaxanthine. This conclusion is derived from the simultaneous occurrence of both reactions: (a) In flashed leaves, blue absorbance change and xanthophyll conversion take place under strong (2 mW . cm-2) but not under weak (0.02 mW . cm-2) white light. (b) In chloroplasts isolated from flashed leaves, the blue absorbance change occurs in the dark under conditions that also induce the xanthophyll conversion. (c) Blue absorbance change and xanthophyll conversion are both inhibited by dithiothreitol. In addition, the light-induced blue absorbance change is reversed in the dark if aerobic conditions are maintained, i.e. under conditions that in normal leaves favor the reversal of the above reaction sequence. The significance of the xanthophyll conversion is discussed in relation to other phenomena occurring in flashed leaves after exposure to continuous illumination.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0006-3002			MEDLINE:7356988	7356988

The purpose of this study is to study the effect of NaCl concentration and pH on hydrogen evolution reaction of X60 steel. Design/methodology/approach A cathodic polarization curve 257E-2V vs OCP and EIS was obtained by conventional three-electrode system in different NaCl concentrations, 257E3.5 and pH. Second, various parameters such as hydrogen evolution, over-potential current-density polarization resistance and capacitance of double electric layer were obtained based on fitting of the experimental data. Finally, the reaction mechanism was determined by Tafel curves. Findings It was concluded that in different NaCl concentrations, diffusion layer induced by concentration polarization affects the diffusion process of H+ ions, which makes over-potential increase. Under great effect of concentration polarization, the reaction is different in acid and alkaline environments, and the dielectric layer shows the characteristic of meta-alkaline adsorption, which makes difference in mechanism.

These hybrid materials exhibit outstanding catalytic activity and chemoselectivity for the conversion of a wide range of substituted nitroarenes to their corresponding anilines under relatively mild reaction conditions. The high catalytic performance is attributed to the formation of cobalt nanoparticles and to the presence of atomically dispersed Co species in close interaction with nitrogen-doped graphene. Both active species are formed in situ during the pyrolytic transformation of ZIF-67. The catalysts could be reused in consecutive runs, exhibiting a slightly lower activity ascribed to blockage of the active sites by strongly adsorbed reaction species. These results open up a pathway for the design of noble-metal-free solid catalysts for industrial applications.									67	5	0	0	5	0	71			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000403016400020

Recent data have significantly modified the energetic picture of Photosystem II: the midpoint potentials of the first redox carriers in the chain leading to water-splitting have been reevaluated, the free-energy changes associated with the subsequent electron/proton transfer steps have been estimated and, last but not least, the free-energy landscape of the water-splitting reaction is starting to emerge with the identification of reaction intermediates and the free-energy chances associated with the formation of these transient species.

We believe that O-2 dissociatively adsorbs at 673 K on the Pd, and "spills over" onto the support where further reaction takes place. Tin+ interstitial ions in the bulk crystal lattice react with the spillover oxygen at the surface, preferentially growing TiO2 around and over the particles. We employ a kinetic Monte-Carlo scheme to simulate this surface reaction and find a good correlation between the simulation and STM images. The simulation indicates that the surface structure may be reproduced in a model in which mobile species spillover from the metal particle, performs a random walk until it reaches a step edge where it may react (with low probability) to form TiO2 The mobile species may also down-step to a lower terrace but up-stepping is forbidden. The temporal evolution of surface structures from both experiment and simulation are compared. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In the present work, porosity is introduced to the carbon nitride material using mesoporous silica material, MCM-41, as a hard template, and a mesoporous carbon nitride (MCN) material is synthesized. Further, the MCN is modified by immobilizing metal phthalocyanine (MPc, where M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn). The resulting MPc-incorporated MCN materials (MPc@MCN) were tested for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic and basic media. Detailed studies reveal that the FePc@MCN and CoPc@MCN materials exhibit higher ORR activity than the other composites in 0.1 M KOH. FePc@MCN follows a direct four-electron oxygen reduction mechanism and shows ORR onset potential (vs RHE) at 0.93 V (in 0.1 M KOH), which is very close to the onset potential exhibited by the state-of-the-art material, Pt-C (1.0 V), and higher than several similar composites of MPc with carbon supports tested in similar environments. Besides, due to the inherent property of coordination through nitrogen present on the MCN, FePc@MCN shows excellent stability even after 3000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles. FePc@MCN was found to have a better methanol tolerance in comparison to Pt-C in basic medium. CoPc@MCN shows a highly selective two-electron reduction reaction in both acidic and basic media at lower overpotential than many of the reported catalysts for the two-electron oxygen reduction. Therefore, these materials (FePc@MCN and CoPc@MCN) can be used as suitable alternatives to replace Pt and other expensive materials in ORR and related applications.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			0743-7463			WOS:000584421100012	32970946

The effect of laser energy on the measurement of oxide stoichiometry of Co2FeO4 nanoparticles by atom probe tomography								Microscopy and Microanalysis				27	suppl.1			990	1		10.1017/S1431927621003755				2021	2021	Water electrolysis for hydrogen production serves as a critical technology in the renewable energy cycle. However, the efficiency of water electrolysis remains a challenge, predominantly due to limitations in the performance of the anode electrocatalysts where the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) takes place. Therefore, developing high-performance OER catalysts is essential for improving the electrolysis efficiency. Transition metal oxides, e.g., spinel cobalt oxides, have attracted enormous attention due to their promising activity and durability in alkaline condition. Optimization of the electrocatalytic performance of nanoparticles requires a thorough understanding of the structure-performance relationships. In this study, we employed atom probe tomography (APT) [1] to reveal the three-dimensional location of individual elements of Co2FeO4 spinel oxide nanoparticles (10 nm in diameter). The measurement of oxide stoichiometry by APT strongly depends on the laser pulse energy and associated electric field [2]. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of laser energy on the measurement of oxide stoichiometry of the Co2FeO4nanoparticles.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1431-9276			INSPEC:21023679

The catalysts were synthesized by simple impregnation of the metal salts on carbon support and followed by pyrolysis in CH4 atmosphere. The obtained catalysts show impressive HER activities in both brine and alkaline media. At current density of -7.0 mA cm(-2), the overpotential for Co modified Mo/C catalysts was greater than that obtained with a commercial Pt/C catalyst by 63-89 mV and 15-148 mV for brine and alkaline solution, respectively. Our findings for HER in both media are consistent with electrochemical desorption of hydrogen gas following the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism as the rate-determining step. The HER activities of the catalysts were correlated to their high mesopore surface areas with active pores, nanocrystallites, and low charge transfer resistances as confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.

The experiments were performed in molten Li + K and Na + K carbonate eutectics saturated with a 0.9 O-2 + 0.1 CO2 atmosphere at 1000 K. It was concluded that the oxidation of Ni proceeds predominantly by decomposition of an unstable compound in the Li2CO3 + K2CO3 melt and directly by evolution of CO2, in the Na2CO3 + K2CO3 melt. The measurements of the exchange currents and double-layer capacities showed that the reaction path of oxidation affects the effective area of NiO electrodes.									37	0	0	0	0	0	37			0022-0728			WOS:A1995RH80400013

The UOR process has been proved to be a two-step process which involves an electrochemical pre-oxidation reaction of the metal sites and a subsequent chemical oxidation of the urea molecules on the as-formed high-valence metal sites. Hence, designing advanced (pre-)catalysts with a boosted pre-oxidation reaction is of great importance in improving the UOR performance and thus accelerating the coupled reactions. In this feature article, we discuss the significant role of the pre-oxidation process during the urea electro-oxidation reaction, and summarize detailed strategies and recent advances in promoting the pre-oxidation reaction, including the modulation of the crystallinity, active phase engineering, defect engineering, elemental incorporation and constructing hierarchical nanostructures. We anticipate that this feature article will offer helpful guidance for the design and optimization of advanced (pre-)catalysts for UOR and related energy conversion applications.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000750444200001	35084411

Lion, A; Johlitz, M		Simulation of oxidative aging processes in elastomer components using a dynamic network model								CONSTITUTIVE MODELS FOR RUBBER X								77	82						2017	2017	The majority of rubbery components in industrial applications is subjected to environmental influences. Especially exposition to oxygen leads to a change in material behaviour due to reaction of the network structure with oxygen. Its availibility is limited by diffusion processes leading to a deceleration of the oxidative aging processes in the inner regions, also known as Diffusion-Limited Oxidation (DLO). Using a dynamic network model presented in previous works, this coupled problem can be solved efficiently using a staggered solution algorithm. While classical two-network models are limited to two-step processes, this model is capable of simulating oxidative ageing under varying mechanical loads by describing the evolution of a single network which continuously softens and stiffens due to oxidation processes. The solution algorithm is implemented in ABAQUS and numerical results are shown. Comparison to experimental data shows the valid prediction of the change in mechanical behaviour for inhomogeneously aged parts.					10th European Conference on Constitutive Models for Rubber (ECCMR)10th European Conference on Constitutive Models for Rubber (ECCMR)	AUG 28-31, 2017AUG 28-31, 2017	Springer; Netzsch; Michelin; Endurica; Brabender; Boge Rubber & Plast; SynoptSpringer; Netzsch; Michelin; Endurica; Brabender; Boge Rubber & Plast; Synopt	Munich, GERMANYMunich, GERMANY	5	0	0	0	0	0	5					978-1-315-22327-8; 978-1-138-03001-5	WOS:000582430100011

The need for a bifunctional air electrode to improve the kinetics of oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) is a major challenge of this battery technology. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that a highest-activity air electrode catalyzed by lithiated PdO nanoislands decorating lithiated NiO nanoparticles enhances the iron molten air battery. It is found that the lithiated NiO nanoparticles uniquely decorated with lithiated PdO nanoislands are in situ formed during the battery cycling. The air electrode exhibits more efficient activity at catalyzing OER/ORR and a superior rate performance compared with that with the bare NiO catalyst. Cycling tests for the iron molten air battery show stable performance through 100 cycles with the highest Coulombic efficiency of 98.7% and average discharge potential of similar to 1.10 V. This study is expected to open up exciting opportunities for developing an efficient air electrode for iron molten air batteries.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1932-7447			WOS:000430896500009

These phenomena are known to be critical to the deposition of high quality thin films of PZT. However, to isolate the role of each cation species and the influence of its gas phase properties, we have also looked beyond the ablation of the PZT ceramic. In this paper, we detail our observations during pulsed laser ablation of electroceramic and metallic targets, specifically PZT, Pb and Ti. We have observed the evolution and transport of molecular species during gas phase expansion over a wide range of oxygen pressures (10(-7)-10(-1) mbar) and laser fluences (0.3-10 Jcm(-2)). The yields of the molecular ion species are strongly dependent upon the number density of the background gas. We propose an interpretation of the relative yields of the species based upon their respective gas phase binding energies and their ease of formation based upon the reaction thermodynamics and reaction cross-section of each species.

Herein, by first -principles calculations, we systematically studied the structural stability, electronic properties and ORR catalytic activity of metal-hexahydroxybenzene nanosheets, M-3(C6O6), M = 3d and 4d transition metals. Based on formation energy, phonon spectrum and ab-initio molecular dynamics analyses, eight monolayer M3(C6O6) (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Ru and Rh) show superior thermodynamic, kinetic and thermal stabilities. Further ORR catalytic activity evaluation shown Cu-3(C6O6) and Rh-3(C6O6) had promising applications in catalyzing ORR 4e(-)pathway, with limiting potentials 0.76 and 0.80 V, respectively. The linear relationship between integrated crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP) and delta G(OH* )explains the suitable adsorption energy of OH* on the catalyst, resulting in the excellent ORR activity of Cu3(C6O6) and Rh3(C6O6). Our study on M-3(C6O6) provides references for the research of other 2D MOFs as ORR catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000868431000004

Studies were carried out on different oxygen chemisorption scenarios, with and without site vacancies on the edge of the char molecule, which represent an essential char oxidation at high and low temperatures, respectively. It is shown that a process of rearrangement or migration of the atom O might happen along the active carbonaceous edge before final desorptions, except for certain direct mechanisms of CO desorption by one step. CO2 can also be generated from the oxygen complex at the edge but only in an indirect way with intermediate steps. The competing characteristics were characterized and compared to produce CO and/or CO2 based on the typical reaction pathways obtained. Typically, CO proved always easier to desorb when compared to CO2 by thermal desorption from C(O). The model was essentially verified with theoretical and experimental results from the literature. Thus, the oxidation of carbon of char to yield CO and CO2 is expected to be better recovered from the view in the microscale.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000783122600005

Herein, we present a study of the ORR electrocatalytic activity of different mesosubstituted Co-corroles with varying electronegativity using both experimental and theoretical methods. Specifically, we studied the influence of different mesosubstituted Co-corroles on catalytic activity. Using density functional theory (DFT), we computed lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies, vertical excitation energies, electrostatic potentials, and O-2 adsorption energies and compared them with the ORR catalytic activity obtained from cyclic voltammetry and rotating ring-disk electrode measurements. We found that the first one-electron reduction for all the corroles occurs at the Co-center based on computed LUMOs, and that this is a necessary step for the ORR mechanism to take place. The ORR reduction potential trends observed from theory and experiments are in good agreement. Based on this work, we conclude that the role of the substituents is significant and an important factor that affects the overpotential required for the ORR.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000503919500011

Here, different contents of transition metal atom Mn adsorbed on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) were investigated for OER properties by first-principles calculations. Based on the Gibbs free energy, 2Mn-C3N4 possesses higher OER properties, and has a lower over-potential (1.22 V) than Mn-C3N4 (2.42 V). 2Mn-C3N4 has moderate absorption energies for OH and OOH, which benefits the first one-electron reaction and the O-2 desorption during the OER. Additionally, by analyzing the partial density of states and projected crystal orbital Hamilton population, the anti-bonding states become less occupied and the adsorption strength of OH is enhanced in 2Mn-C3N4. Thus, the adsorptive strength of 2Mn-C3N4 for OH is stronger than that of Mn-C3N4, which causes 2Mn-C3N4 to show a higher OER activity. The metal-support interaction can alter the local electronic characteristics. The interaction between the metal active center and the reaction intermediates can influence the OER performance, where the specific orbital hybridization plays an important role. Therefore, our results provide a primary understanding of the influence of orbital hybridization intensity on effective OER catalysts.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000719965600001

However, they still suffer from poor electronic conductivity and structural stability. We combined NiFe-LDH nanosheets with Magneli phase Ti4O7 into a heterostructured composite. A series of analyses reveal that decorating Ti4O7 facilitates charge transfer to enhance the conductivity of NiFe-LDH-Ti4O7. During electrochemical measurement, Ni-2(+) is transformed to metastable Ni3+ (Ni (OH) -> NiOOH) before the OER onset potential. Thus, the presence of Ni3+ as the main active sites could improve the chemisorption of OH- to facilitate OER. As a result, the NiFe-LDH-Ti4O7 catalyst delivers as low as onset potential (1.43 V). Combining the holey structure (NiFe-LDH and Ti4O7) and the defect engineering generated on NiFe-LDH-Ti4O7 as a synergistic effect improves the OER performance. The inclusion of Ti4O7 in the composite leads to more vacancy sites, as evidenced by the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis. The obtained defective structure with a low coordination environment would improve the electronic conductivity and facilitate the adsorption process of H2O onto metal cations, thereby increasing the intrinsic catalytic activity of NiOOH. The strong coupling of NiFe-LDH and Ti4O7 also increases the stability, and the heterostructured composite helps maintain the structural robustness of the LDH. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we report new strategies to improve CdS photocorrosion resistance properties significantly by coating Ni2P shell and assembling an artificial gill to remove newly formed O-2 from water. Ni2P@CdS catalyst can achieve the over-all water splitting under visible light irradiation without addition of any sacrifice reagent and noble metal loading. Compared with CdS itself, the 10Ni(2)P@CdS photocatalyst exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution (251.4 mu mol of H-2 in 180 min) with a high AQE (3.89% at 430 nm). This catalyst also presents high photocurrent, low overpotential (-0.32 V vs SCE), and long fluorescence lifetime (16.27 ns) of excited charges. Cd2+ ions concentration measured by ICP and long term stability results verified the anti-photocorrosion role of Ni2P shell on CdS during water splitting reaction. The activity and stability of 10Ni(2)P@CdS is even superior to typical 1Pt@CdS catalyst. Our results confirm CdS can be an active catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water under visible irradiation if its stability is enhanced by protection of anti-photocorrosion over coating shell and removing the nascent formed oxygen from water.									292	12	0	0	24	0	295			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000414109700026		
J	Liu, Bin; Feng, Shijia; Yang, Lifei; Li, Chengcheng; Luo, Zhibin; Wang, Tuo; Long, Jinlin								Bifacial passivation of n-silicon metal-insulator-semiconductor photoelectrodes for efficient oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions								ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE				13	1			221	228		10.1039/c9ee02766a				JAN 1 2020	2020	Silicon-based (Si-based) junctions have been widely investigated in recent years as photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting photoelectrodes, including buried junctions and metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) Schottky junctions. However, Si-based MIS photoelectrodes suffer from low performance for the PEC oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) because of the dilemma that a thin insulator cannot provide enough interfacial passivation while a thick insulator will block the transport of charge carriers. Another trade-off is the fact that the photovoltage extracted from the band offset between the metal and semiconductor will be counteracted by the parasitic light absorption of the metal layer, sacrificing the saturation photocurrent. This paper describes the design and realization of a bifacial passivation strategy for the metal/Si interface of an MIS photoelectrode, featuring a bi-layer stack consisting of amorphous silicon (a-Si) for passivating the silicon surface and a metal oxide (TiO2) for passivating the metal surface. Upon the bifacial passivation of both a-Si and TiO2, the minority carrier lifetime of the Si MIS photoanode was significantly improved from 18 to 2360 mu s. Enabled by this extremely long minority carrier lifetime, it becomes possible to place the MIS junction on the back side of a Si substrate to construct an inverted-MIS (I-MIS) structure to eliminate the parasitic light absorption of traditional Si MIS photoelectrodes. The obtained photoelectrode exhibits an excellent onset potential of 0.85 V and 0.62 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for the OER and HER, respectively. Eventually, unprecedented applied bias photon-to-current efficiencies (ABPE) of 3.91% and 12.66% were obtained by Si MIS and Si I-MIS, which are the highest among MIS-based photoanodes and photocathodes, with 30 h and 108 h stable operation. When pairing the Si I-MIS photocathode with a BiVO4 photoanode to form a PEC membrane-free tandem cell, an unbiased solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 1.9% is achieved.									39	2	0	0	2	0	40			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000508857600014

Herein, we fabricate a unique approach to a stable metal-organic framework (MOF) based on zinc oxide/cobalt oxide (MOF ZnO/Co3O4) array synthesis aided by a sacrificial template technique and followed by the decoration of three-dimensional MOF arrays using amorphous iron oxide/hydroxide (FeOOH) nanoparticles. The highly active FeOOH nanoparticles are tightly bound to the surface of the MOF ZnO/Co3O4 array. These integrated heterostructures provide copious active sites, a large electrochemical surface area, an effective charge-mass transfer, and a strong integration between MOF ZnO/Co3O4 and FeOOH nanoparticles. Ascribed to all such aspects, FeOOH @ MOF ZnO/Co3O4 nanorods supported on nickel foam show an oxygen evolution reaction activity order of magnitude higher than that of individual entities in an alkaline solution with an overpotential of 260 mV achieved at a current density of 50 mA.cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1). This behavior can be ascribed to the effect of amorphous FeOOH nanoparticles being tightly anchored on the MOF ZnO/Co3O4 surface, which not only synergistically enriches the electrochemical surface area but also enhances the active sites. This work offers to open a new strategy to design and fabricate advanced electrode materials for the water electrolysis process.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000552662200108

La2CuO4 is dissolved by aqueous acid at proton-mass transport limited rates in 1 M NaCl. Rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) techniques were employed in collection (product detection) and shielding (reactant removal) measure modes to monitor the surface chemistry, including a new approach not involving separate disk electrode H+ reduction measurements as required heretofore.(6) Related techniques monitoring the competitive oxygen evolution reaction were used to study the coulometric efficiency of anodic formation of the superconductor phases, La2CuO4+x, in alkaline medium.

Nanostructured nickel based electrocatalysts for hybrid ethanol-water anion exchange membrane electrolysis								JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING				10	3					107994	10.1016/j.jece.2022.107994				JUN 2022	2022	Ni and Ni-Fe nanostructured layers prepared by magnetron sputtering in an oblique angle deposition configuration (MS-OAD) have been used as anode and cathode catalysts for hybrid ethanol-water electrolysis in an anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyser. Physico-chemical and electrochemical characterization in a threeelectrode cell has been carried out to determine the optimal characteristics of the anodic films. Current densities up to 434 mA cm-2 at 2.0 V in a 1.5 M EtOH and 2.0 M KOH fuel solution were achieved with excellent operational stability for 3 days. These experiments show that the oxygen evolution reaction taking place at the anode is completely replaced by the ethanol oxidation reaction under our explored reaction conditions. The obtained results evidence the interest of this kind of organic vs. pure water electrolysis to decrease the overall electrical energy consumption for the production of hydrogen.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000812983500001

Measuring RTDs in combustors is challenging, due to high temperatures, chemical reactions, the presence of particles or corrosive species as well as high turbulence levels. This paper presents a technique for the in situ measurement of RTDs in combustors. Based on tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS), the temporal evolution of the concentration of tracers is tracked simultaneously at the combustion chamber inlet and outlet. Using either air or mixtures of oxygen and carbon dioxide (oxy-fuel atmosphere) as oxidants, the method is applied to reacting and non-reacting operating conditions in a 20-kWth methane combustor. For reacting conditions, hydrogen chloride is used as a tracer, whereas for non-reacting conditions methane was chosen. Depending on the tracer, for a repetition rate of approximately 2 kHz detection limits of 16-40 -ppmV are achieved. For deriving RTDs, low-pass filtering is compared to reactor network modeling. Different RTDs observed for varying operating conditions are discussed.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0723-4864	1432-1114		WOS:000404657500002

The nature of the active sites is revealed, namely the role of surface copper dimers, which are present on the Cu2O(001) surface and in the nanoclusters of size Cu32O16 and Cu14O7. The major difference between metal catalysts and Cu2O is outlined: the CO2 molecule interacts strongly with the oxide and undergoes bending prior to hydrogenation. The first step of CO2 hydrogenation results in the formation of a stable carboxyl intermediate, -CO(OH), which in the following steps is converted to methanol via formic acid and formaldehyde intermediates. The consumption of hydrogen from water leaves surface peroxo- and hydroperoxo-species. The peroxides easily desorb molecular oxygen, while for hydroperoxides the reaction of oxygen evolution requires an activation energy of 130 kJ mol(-1). The maxima in the absorption spectra correspond well with the required activation energies in the elementary steps.									41	1	0	0	1	0	41			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000352707200087	25826462

However, the poor conductivity of ((oxy)hydr)oxides and the difficulty in adjusting their electronic structure limit their application. As an alternative strategy, instead of constituting the array electrode by the active components themselves, we herein report 3D Co(OH)(2)@MnO2 heterostructure decorated carbon nanoarrays grown directly on carbon paper (Co(OH)(2)@MnO2-CNAs). This unique structure can not only enhance electrical conductivity but also provide a larger specific surface area, and facilitate electrolyte diffusion and ion transport. The heterostructured Co(OH)(2)@MnO2 formed via incorporation with MnO2 facilitates the transition of Co-II to Co-III in Co(OH)(2) and it increases the storage of oxidative charge in the catalyst, leading to an OER activity matching with benchmark RuO2 and good stability. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the improved OER performance can be attributed to the formation of the heterojunction structure, resulting in the modulation of the electronic structure of Co atoms and the reduction of the free energy barrier of the rate-determining step for the OER.

Various parameters are modified to obtain three different samples. These samples are tested for high performance supercapacitors and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. The optimised sample NiCoeC-1 gave a high specific capacity of 308mAh g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1) in a 2M KOH electrolyte. An asymmetric supercapacitor assembly prepared from NiCoeC-1 as the positive electrode and the nitrogen-doped carbon as the negative electrode, exhibited an energy density of up to 31.8Wh Kg(-1) for a high power density of 6.2 kW kg(-1) over a potential window of 0-1.55 V. Two of our best samples were also tested for OER, giving good water oxidation kinetics, revealed by their lower Tafel slopes of around 107mV and a low over potential (h) of around 420 mV at a current density of 10 mAcm(-2). Hence, this work opens great avenues for biomass-derived materials for high performance supercapacitors and catalysis. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, ZnS nanoparticles (NPs) were embedded on different amounts of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanosheets with the help of ultrasonic waves. The role of the RGO-ZnS nanocomposites as an efficient photoanode for oxygen evolution reaction was evaluated. The RGO-ZnS nanocomposite with 10% RGO (RGO10-ZnS) exhibits outstanding photoelectrocatalytic activity compared with ZnS, RGO, and other prepared nanocomposites. It shows a negative onset potential of -200 mV with a maximum photocurrent density of 1.1 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V (vs RHE) in Na2SO4 (0.5 M) solution which is five times higher than that of ZnS NPs. The solar-simulated light power is saved 1 V from the external power source or produced power of 0.9 mW cm(-2). RG010-ZnS showed -400 mV increase in the photovoltage than that of ZnS nanoparticles. The excellent conductivity and high surface area of RGO provide an outstanding ability to the nanocomposite to harvest and localize the light near ZnS NPs through its plasmonic structure which causes a negative shift in the onset potential compared with both ZnS and RGO. In other words, RGO has the ability to trap light in modes so-called surface plasmons. The light surface plasmon resonances can efficiently enhance the optical absorption at resonant frequency to slow down the photons.									28	2	0	0	4	0	28			0038-092X			WOS:000424854800024

However, to date, the creation of bimetallic nanoframes with tunable structure remains a challenge. Herein, we develop a simple yet efficient chemical method that allows the preparation of highly composition segregated Pt-Ni nanocrystals with controllable shape and high yield. The selective use of dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DTAC) and control of oleylamine (OM)/oleic acid (OA) ratio are critical to the controllable creation of highly composition segregated Pt-Ni nano crystals. While DTAC mediates the compositional anisotropic growth, the OM/OA ratio controls the shapes of the obtained highly composition segregated Pt-Ni nanocrystals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on composition segregated tetrahexahedral Pt-Ni NCs. Importantly, by simply treating the highly composition segregated Pt-Ni nanocrystals with acetic acid overnight, those solid Pt-Ni nanocrystals can be readily transformed into highly open Pt-Ni nanoframes with hardly changed shape and size. The resulting highly open Pt-Ni nanoframes are high-performance electrocatalysts for both oxygen reduction reaction and alcohol oxidations, which are far better than those of commercial Pt/C catalyst. Our results reported herein suggest that enhanced catalysts can be developed by engineering the structure/composition of the nanocrystals.									152	14	0	0	5	0	158			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000374274600095	26950511

Recently, the main challenge is to prepare the efficient materials at a low cost, earth-abundant, high durability, and catalytic action for water splitting applications. In this present work, the pristine and different molar concentrations of Fe doped SrWO4 was produced via simple co-precipitation technique. The high crystalline peak at 27.6 degrees explored (112) crystal plane confirmed the SrWO4 formation. In Raman spectra, active modes such as stretching and bending vibrations of [WO4]2- tetrahedron confirmed the existence of SrWO4. The flower-like morphology was briefly investigated by using SEM characterization. Moreover, the elements such as Sr, W, O and Fe were existed in proper ratio, which also confirmed the formation of SrWO4. The prepared electrocatalysts was tested by two different electrolytes such as 1 M KOH electrolyte and seawater + 1 M KOH electrolytes. In addition, electrochemical measurements of electrocatalysts prepared with and without Fe doping were characterized and compared. The overpotential of the prepared electrocatalysts including SW1, SW2 and SW3 were 206, 182, 154 mV (for alkaline electrolyte) and 261, 198, 172 mV (for alkaline natural seawater electrolyte). In both electrolytes, 0.02 M Fe doped SrWO4 explored outstanding HER action and high durability because of existence of elevated surface area and exclusive morphology. Hence, the present study recommends developing strontium based materials in electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000747392800003

Herein, we report a series of ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) carbon-free Fe3O4-decorated beta-Co(OH)(2) nanosheets (Fe3O4/Co(OH)(2) NSs) as OER electrocatalysts with different Co/Fe mole ratios from 1 to 31. It is found that the different amounts of iron incorporation into Co(OH)(2) NSs affects the structure of Fe3O4/Co(OH)(2) NSs, while the optimized incorporation boosts the electrocatalytic activity of Co(OH)(2) NSs for OER, i.e. the Fe3O4/Co(OH)(2) NSs with a Co/Fe molar ratio of 15 demonstrate superior catalytic properties with respect to the lowest overpotential and smallest Tafel slope in alkaline media. First principles calculations used for exploring mechanisms show that Fe3+ from Fe3O4/Co(OH)(2) NSs adsorbs water molecules more energetically favorably on the surface and would offer far more improvement of the catalytic activity compared with Fe2+. Combined with structure analysis and calculation results, the better catalytic activity is attributed to the ultrathin structure, high active site exposure, lower adsorption energy towards water molecules and the increased positive charge of adsorbed water molecules.

The Tafel coefficients in the presence of cosolvent are explained in terms of the change of the rate-determining step (r.d.s.) of the OER electrode mechanism, coating dissolution and/or cosolvent oxidation. Of the several cosolvents investigated t-BuOH and PC show less effects on the OER and electrode properties making them the best choice for organic eletrosynthesis applications, in contrast to AN, which causes coating dissolution, and DMF and DMSO which show an anticipation of the voltammetric current.									22	4	0	0	0	0	24			0021-891X			WOS:000177837500002

However, the role of heteroatoms in determining reactivity and stability is poorly understood. Here, the study of a platform of polyaniline-derived and activated carbons, with distinct porous properties, and heteroatom type, content, and speciation, enables establishing improved structure-performance relationships. In-depth characterization reveals that, while several oxygen species potentially catalyze the reaction, carbonyl groups are the main functionality governing the activity. Oxygen loss via propane-driven water evolution is the main deactivation path. Six-fold enhanced stability evidenced over carbon catalysts derived from KOH-post-treated polyanilines demonstrates the importance of controlling the nanostructure for enhancing longevity.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000640664300001

The behavior of the species involved is governed by the general balance equation including forward and backward elementary processes whose rate coefficients are in part based on experimental data. Extrapolation methods are used when necessary. During the population densities time- evolution, a quasi steady state can be identified: a global rate coefficient can be derived only during this state. The rates therefore obtained are fitted under a modified Arrhenius law and some of them are finally compared with experimental results.					7th European Symposium on Aerothermodynamics7th European Symposium on Aerothermodynamics	9-12 May 20119-12 May 2011	AFOSR: Int. - EOARDAFOSR: Int. - EOARD	Brugge, BelgiumBrugge, Belgium	0	0	0		0	0	0					978-92-9092-256-8	INSPEC:12938274

The Ni ferrite showed a higher activity in CLRE, which was also confirmed by TPR experiments. During the first minutes of reaction, when the materials still acted as reactants while being reduced at the same time, the two oxides showed differences in regard to the nature of the products formed. During reduction, the structural evolution was monitored by means of several physical techniques, thus showing the formation of MnO and metallic species (Ni and Mn) as well.

The NiO/alpha-Fe2O3@NF composite electrode, with NiO and alpha-Fe2O3 well-mixed at nanoscale for much enhanced synergistic effects, exhibited extraordinary electrochemical activities with ultralow overpotentials of 244 and 334 mV at current densities of 50 and 500 mA/cm(2) respectively, for the OER in 1 M KOH. The NiO/alpha-Fe2O3@NF composite electrode was further tested as both the cathode and anode for overall water splitting, and achieved low working cell voltages of 1.76 and 1.99 V at the current densities of 50 and 500 mA/cm(2), respectively, outperforming the pairing of Pt/C@NF and IrO2@NF, 1.79 and 2.08 V, correspondingly. The stability of the NiO/alpha-Fe2O3@NF electrode was also outstanding, experiencing only a minor chronoamperometric decay of 5.6% after a continuous operation at 500 mA/cm(2) for 24 h. The success of the present catalyst design was attributed to the strong positive synergistic effects.between the well mixed NiO and alpha-Fe2O3 at nanoscale and between the nonconductive mixed oxide catalyst and the conductive nickel foam support.									23	1	0	0	1	0	23			2574-0962			WOS:000458706900090

This work presents a green alternative to the common methods for making NP-Au. In this work, we create NP-Au by free corrosion dealloying of a Au-Cu parent alloy at room temperature in a near-neutral pH aqueous solution of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), a non-toxic chelating ligand. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), catalyzed by activated carbon cloth (ACC), is employed to drive selective oxidation of Cu into Cu2+ ions, and EDTA is used to sequester the Cu2+ ions, preventing passivating copper oxide (CuOx)-forming reactions. We call this methodology chelation-mediated dealloying. Using small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we observe that the NP-Au produced under mild conditions is similar to that produced by free corrosion dealloying in nitric acid (HNO3), a highly hazardous and strong oxidizing acid.

This paper presents a novel two-dimensional transition-metal chalcogenide material Ni2SbTe2 for ORR, which has a stable three-dimensional counterpart and can be obtained through exfoliation. First-principles calculations with solvation correction show that the edge sites of few-layer Ni2SbTe2 possess better ORR performances than the basal plane. The (014) surface not only is energetically favorable but also demonstrates a high ORR onset potential of 0.52 V (the Pt(111) onset potential is 0.50 V). An interesting triple-element synergic effect has been revealed in the Ni-Sb-Te system, where Te helps to reduce the bonding strength between surface Ni and adsorbed O. Meanwhile, the capability of Sb to donate different numbers of electrons can improve O-2 adsorption and reduce Delta G(*OH). A detailed comparative study of Ni2SbTe2, NiSb, NiTe2, NiSe2, Co2SbTe, and Ni2SbSe2 as ORR electrocatalysts is given.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000514221600026

It has been witnessed that even a small refinement in morphology alters the catalytic activity over several folds which is a key towards catalyst design. The present study thereby explores the design of octahedral CoS2 crystals with the aim of exposing highly active facets for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) which were carefully synthesized to incorporate carbon inherently. One-pot hydrothermal synthesis was employed using trisodium citrate and sodium thiosulfate. The resultant crystals of octahedral CoS2 with exposed {111} and {220} planes were revealed by HR-TEM and XRD studies. Detailed structure-activity insight regarding ORR was obtained using rotating ring disk electrode and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) analysis and facet controlled octahedral CoS2 was shown to have the 50 fold increase in activity relative to other variants in an acidic medium and is comparable to a state-of-the-art Pt/C (20%) catalyst. The local catalytic activity of the CoS2 catalyst was visualized by the redox-competition mode of scanning electrochemical microscopy (RC-SECM).									31	1	0	0	1	0	31			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000451738200018

This reaction is sluggish and relies on high overpotentials (wasted energy), while only oxygen is generated as a low value oxidation by-product. Coupling hydrogen generation to a less unfavorable oxidation reaction creating higher value products is therefore a recommendable issue. Here we found that poly(heptazine imide) (PHI), a stable and reactive allotrope of crystalline carbon nitride, supported with highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles (PtNPs) could achieve efficient and persistent H-2 and CH4 production by photocatalytic reforming of biomass derived alcohols under visible light irradiation. The results reveal that PHI with low grain boundary defects restrains the bulk charge carrier recombination and largely promotes photocatalytic efficiency. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of the optimized material for visible light H-2 evolution could reach values as high as 15% at 420 nm. The DFT results reveal that the activity is associated with the Tafel step rather than the Volmer-Tafel step. This study highlights the development of a new covalent scaffold for the simultaneous generation of storable and valuable chemical fuels (H-2 and CH4) in a feasible photocatalytic manner.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000718977700001

To identify compounds that are intrinsically active and can fully take advantage of the high surface area of 2D catalysts, this study focuses on the properties of the ideal basal planes of 2D TMDCs, in the 2H, 1T, and 1T' phases. Over two hundred materials proposed in computational databases are studied by means of first-principles-based simulations coupled with continuum embedding models to account for the presence of electrochemical environments. The best candidates with overpotentials for the oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER and ORR) lower than 0.5 V under acidic conditions and higher stability against degradation in electrochemical environments are selected. For OER, the designed workflow identifies one active and thermodynamically stable material, and seven materials that are metastable at the oxidative potentials and acidic pH. On the other hand, for ORR, we identify 20 materials with overpotentials less than 0.5 V. Among these compounds, six bifunctional materials have been experimentally reported, with 1T-NbTe2 and 1T'-MoTe2 being the best performing catalysts for OER and ORR, respectively.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1948-7185			WOS:000737992700001	34958230

Herein, we report Fe-doped nickel hydroxide carbonate hierarchical microtubes with Ag nanoparticles (denoted Ag/NiFeHC HMTs) through hydrolysis precipitation process. Experimental tests and density functional theory calculations reveal that Fe doping can tune the electron configuration to enhance the conductivity, markedly improve the electrochemical surface area to expose more active sites, and act as reactive centers to lower the free energy of the rate determination step. In addition, the unique hierarchical structure can also offer active sites and excellent cycling stability. Benefitting from these advantages, the as-obtained Ag/NiFeHC HMTs show excellent oxygen evolution reaction activity, with an overpotential of 208 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. Also, it could achieve long-term stability at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) for 24 h.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2637-9368		WOS:000789527200001

This work entails the use of conventional characterization techniques such as XRD, Raman, FE-SEM, XPS with complementary DFT simulation. Additionally, it is reported for the first time, in-situ Work Function measurements of CO and O-2 interaction in CuO/Cryptomelane catalysts. Results reveal the strong influence of the interfacial properties on CuO/Cryptomelane reducibility, where Cu+ species are formed by means of redox interplay between Cu+2/Cu+ and Mn3+/ Mn4+. The optimal performance is achieved by the efficient participation of two active species: (1) Cu+ from an intimate MnOx contact, providing the active sites for CO oxidation; and (2) surface Cu+ species stabilized in CuO bulky particles for the efficient O-2 refilling.									21	1	0	0	0	0	22			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000518865300050

What is still missing is an understanding of selective leaching of the less noble metal from the ordered structure and its correlation to long-term ORR performance. Using a combination of kinetic Monte Carlo simulations and advanced characterization techniques, we provide unprecedented insight into dealloying of intermetallic PtCu3 nanoparticles a well-known binary alloy. Comparison of ordered and disordered samples with identical initial compositions and particle size distributions reveals an unexpected correlation: whereas the copper dealloying rates in the ordered and disordered counterparts are almost the same, in the ordered structure Pt atoms are surrounded by 15-30% more Cu atoms throughout all the stages of acid leaching. This more convenient Pt-Cu coordination explains the statistically significant increase of 23-37% in ORR activity of the ordered structure at all stages of alloy degradation.									46	2	0	0	1	1	46			2155-5435			WOS:000381236700080

In this perspective, the fabrication of an efficient ternary hybrid composite electrocatalyst consisting of carbon-based materials and earth-abundant metal oxides can be thought as a better choice for large-scale applications. Hybrid of MoO3 and NiO with carbon material would possibly improve stability and conductivity which can assist in improving OER performance. In this regard, we report the development of MoO3/NiO/activated carbon (MoNiAC) ternary hybrid catalyst by a facile, one-step solution combustion synthesis (SCS) method. The physiochemical properties of the synthesized catalyst were evaluated by advanced analytical and spectroscopic techniques. The MoNiAC ternary hybrid catalyst exhibited a lower over-potential (279 mV) (without iR compensation) to attain the current density of 10 mA/cm(2), and small Tafel slope of 89 mV/dec was accompanied. The superior activity could be ascribed to the synergism between MoO3, NiO, and AC. Furthermore, the stability graph of the hybrid demonstrated appreciable durability of catalyst for upto 8.33 h. The characterization of after stability catalyst suggested no major disturbance in the morphology as well as element distribution signifying the high durability of the hybrid catalyst in terms of activity as well as morphology. The remarkable features such as appreciable OER activity, promising kinetics, and robustness ameliorated the performance of MoNiAC hybrid as an electrocatalyst for OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000787657200001

Infrared reflectance spectroscopy analysis indicated that Al existed as Al(OH)(3) in the molybdate conversion coatings.

The as-obtained product (labeled as NiFe-Pi/NF) was characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), EDS mapping, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms. Experiments showed that the as-obtained NiFe-Pi/NF presented excellent OER catalytic activity in a 1 M KOH solution. To deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the present catalyst only required the overpotential of 206 mV with the Tafel slope of 31 mV dec(-1). More importantly, the catalytic activity of the as-obtained NiFe-Pi/NF catalyst hardly decreased after continuously catalyzing 300 h at the current density of 20 mA cm(-2), displaying excellent long-term stability. Compared with commercial RuO2, the present NiFe-Pi/NF catalyst possessed better catalytic activity, indicating that the as-obtained NiFe-Pi/NF catalyst can be used as a potential OER catalyst in practical application.									26	0	0	0	2	0	25			2168-0485			WOS:000498289300016

The adsorption energies were estimated to be 14,100 +/- 420 K for carbon, 400 +/- 30 K for nitrogen, and 1440 +/- 160 K for oxygen. The adsorption energy of oxygen is consistent with experimentally reported values. We found that the binding of a nitrogen atom is purely physisorption, while that of a carbon atom is chemisorption, in which a chemical bond to an O atom of a water molecule is formed. That of an oxygen atom has a dual character, with both physisorption and chemisorption. The chemisorption of atomic carbon also implies the possibility of further chemical reactions to produce molecules bearing a C-O bond, though this may hinder the formation of methane on water ice via sequential hydrogenation of carbon atoms. These properties would have a large impact on the chemical evolution of carbon species in interstellar environments. We also investigated the effects of newly calculated adsorption energies on the chemical compositions of cold dense molecular clouds with the aid of gas-ice astrochemical simulations. We found that abundances of major nitrogen-bearing molecules, such as N-2 and NH3, are significantly altered by applying the calculated adsorption energy, because nitrogen atoms can thermally diffuse on surfaces, even at 10 K.									33	0	0	0	0	0	33			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000426572400006

Surface treatments such as plasma and post-annealing at 500 degrees C in oxygen gas flow were used in order to condition the electrode surface. Electrochemical measurements of the plasma treated samples revealed that the surface was reorganized in terms of enhanced catalytic properties and reduced recombination centers at the surface. Photocurrents in the milli-Ampere range were yielded at 0.92 V(NHE) in 1 M KOH. In contrast to the plasma samples, the post-annealing samples displayed higher bulk crystallinity resulting in a more enhanced photovoltage. XRD and TEM analysis confirmed the texturing of a beneficial highly oriented hematite film (110) parallel to the back contact. Nevertheless, lower photocurrents for this post-annealed sample compared to the plasma one indicated that the catalytic centers were not fully recovered at the surface.					1st International Symposium on Electrochemical Synthesis of Fuels (ESF)1st International Symposium on Electrochemical Synthesis of Fuels (ESF)	OCT 09-14, 2011OCT 09-14, 2011	Electrochem Soc, High Temp Mat Div; Electrochem Soc, Phys & Analyt Electrochemistry Div; Electrochem Soc, Energy Technol Div; New Technol SubcommitteeElectrochem Soc, High Temp Mat Div; Electrochem Soc, Phys & Analyt Electrochemistry Div; Electrochem Soc, Energy Technol Div; New Technol Subcommittee	Boston, MABoston, MA	4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1938-5862	1938-6737	978-1-56677-973-9; 978-1-60768-332-2	WOS:000325217700020

The selective substitution of lanthanum with high content strontium improves the electronic conductivity and increases the oxygen vacancy concentration. Doping of Cu into the B-site of the perovskite induces a synergistic interplay of Ni and Cu, leading to excellent AOR activity. Due to the excellent AOR and HER activity of doped La2NiO4, a symmetric ammonia electrolyzer based on LSNC-Ar (SAE-LSNC-Ar) is assembled and investigated for the removal of ammonia. In addition, the performance of the SAE is comparable to the ammonia electrolyzer based on a PtIr/C anode and Pt/C cathode at low voltage. This is the first report using an oxide with the K2NiF4 structure as an efficient AOR catalyst. The assembled SAE-LSNC-Ar shows approximate to 95% ammonia removal efficiency in real landfill leachate, which is the highest among electrochemical removal of ammonia in landfill leachate. This study paves an attractive route to explore materials with the K2NiF4 structure as highly efficient AOR/HER bifunctional catalysts for the electrolysis of ammonia.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000821636100001

Published reports on single-NP electrocatalysts typically include complicated and difficult methods of synthesis and characterization; moreover, these methods usually fail to provide a reliable way to measure the activities of individual NPs within larger ensembles of particles, i.e., in real-life nanocatalyst systems. In the present work, we synthesized from the gas phase Pd NPs that act as nanoportals for electron transfer within surface-oxidized Mg thin films. The physical synthesis method provided excellent control over the deposition density and, hence, enabled the design of a system where each individual open nanoportal forms an independent active single-NP electrode (SNPE). Being uncoupled from one another, these SNPEs contribute separately toward the total electrocatalytic activity while simultaneously providing a measure of their average, individual activities. We were thus able to fabricate a stable, steady-state electrode for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and to study the activity and stability of the SNPEs over a period of 20 days; the former depended on the size of the NPs, while the latter depended on the SNPEs' resistance to aerial oxidation. The remarkable stability of the ensemble catalysts under OER conditions proves that this concept can be used for further studies on the activities of different single NPs in numerous real-life systems.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000493865700010

A facile, one-step directional growth of catalytically active Ni:FeOOH nanosheets on highly conducting 3D NGF results in a fully integrated, hierarchical, nanostructured electrocatalyst with (i) the high intrinsic activity of Ni:FeOOH, (ii) the outstanding electrical conductivity of NGF, and (iii) a well-defined porous structure with an enhanced active surface area. As a result, the self-supported 3D Ni:FeOOH/NGF electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline solution with an overpotential of 214 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), a high stability for over 60 h, a low Tafel slope of 36.2 mV dec(-1), and a capability of delivering a high current density of 300 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of 368 mV. In contrast to photodeposition, electrodeposition, and hydrothermal methods for the formation/integration of (oxy)hydroxides, this facile solution strategy for designing an attractive and efficient structure with a highly active metal (oxy)hydroxide and highly conducting NGF provides a pathway to develop other earth-abundant electrocatalysts for a multitude of energy-conversion-device applications.									64	1	0	0	1	0	65			2155-5435			WOS:000471212600030

The design and facile synthesis of cathode catalysts with high activity on both ORR and OER are desired. In this study, an ultrathin N-doped defective carbon layerencapsulated W2C hybrid (W2C@ NC) which has been successfully synthesized through a facile in-situ pyrolysis and reduction of WO3@ g-C3N4 shows a high activity on ORR, OER and even the decomposition of the undesired Li2CO3 as a multifunctional cathode catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries. The cells catalyzed by W2C@ NC show a much higher initial capacity of 10976 mAh g(-1), lower overpotential and longer cycle life, which can be largely attributed to the synergistic effect of W2C nanoparticles and the ultrathin defective N-doped carbon layers. The unique architecture not only accelerates the electron and Li+ conduction but also provides more active sites, which lead to the large enhancement of the electrocatalytic performance. In addition to the high activity on both ORR and OER, W2C@ NC also shows a high catalytic function on the decomposition of the undesired side product of Li2CO3. This study offers some new insights into the design and synthesis of novel high performance cathode catalyst for Li-O-2 battery. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The results provided insight into the evolution of the catalytic activity as a function of the pyrolysis temperature. On the basis of the XPS N is analysis, the pyrolysis temperature was optimized at the 900 degrees C since the pyridinic/graphitic N structures which are known to be active sites for the ORR were maximized (4.29% pyridinic N and 7.30% graphitic N). The carbonyl surface group, which is known to be an active site for the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox, was also maximized at the pyrolysis temperature of 900 degrees C (1.11%). This catalyst, adopting two simultaneously working electrodes for in situ H2O2 generation/Fe2+ regeneration, was successfully applied to the removal of the azo-dye (Orange II, TOC removal approximate to 95%) and the trace pharmaceutical compounds [carbamazepine, amoxicillin (approximate to 100% degradation within 90 min) and cimetidine (approximate to 90% degradation within 180 min)]; the pyrolysis-temperature-optimized performance was superior to those of many conventional carbon-based electrocatalysts.									14	2	0	0	3	0	16			2168-0485			WOS:000449577200136

The four protons generated during each reaction cycle are released to the lumen via mechanisms that are poorly understood. Given the complexity of photosystem II, which consists of multiple protein subunits and cofactor molecules and hosts numerous waters, a fundamental issue is finding transient networks of hydrogen bonds that bridge potential proton donor and acceptor groups. Here, we address this issue by performing all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of wild-type and mutant photosystem II monomers, which we analyze using a new protocol designed to facilitate efficient analysis of hydrogen-bond networks. Our computations reveal that local protein/water hydrogen-bond networks can assemble transiently in photosystem II such that the reaction center connects to the lumen. The dynamics of the hydrogen-bond networks couple to the protonation state of specific carboxylate groups and are altered in a mutant with defective proton transfer. Simulations on photosystem II without its extrinsic PsbO subunit provide a molecular interpretation of the elusive functional role of this subunit.									29	2	0	0	13	0	30			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000431723800003	29589763

The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements revealed that the impedance of the battery increased slowly during cycling due to the accumulation of undecomposed discharge products on the cathode.									15	1	0	0	0	0	16			2046-2069			WOS:000369546100092

Effect of the dispersed phase on nucleation and growth of the matrix								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				145	2			549	554		10.1149/1.1838301				FEB 1998	1998	The electrodeposition of Tl2O3/Co3O4 composites has been performed by anodic oxidation of Tl+ ions in the presence of suspended Co3O4 particles. This study, aimed at obtaining and characterizing new electrocatalytic materials for oxygen evolution reaction, has shown that Co3O4 particles enhance the rate of nucleation and growth of the Tl2O3 matrix. At each potential, induction times are shorter and kinetic constants are higher in the presence of Co3O4 than in its absence. The chronoamperometric transients measured during composite deposition are compatible with instantaneous nucleation and 3D growth. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analyses data show that Co3O4 particles become effectively embedded in the deposit from the early stages of its formation and act as centers of preferential growth for the matrix, so that the Co3O4 content is higher near the electrode/composite interface than in the bulk. Tl2O3/Co3O4 composites are compared with other systems for which nucleation and growth of the matrix is unaffected by the dispersed phase.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0013-4651			WOS:000071969500037

The prepared V2O5/Al2O3 composite catalyst was systematically characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and particle size analysis. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic measurements confirmed the uniform distribution of V2O5 in the Al2O3 support catalyst. Li-O-2 cells using the V2O5/Al2O3 composite as the cathode catalyst showed lower overpotentials than V2O5-carbon composites and pure carbon cathodes. The cyclic behavior confirmed that the catalytic effect of the prepared composite not only reduced the overpotentials, but also improved the specific capacities. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, moss-like iron phosphide particles on a nickel foam substrate were fabricated through a combined electrodeposition and solvothermal method and exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance for overwater electrolysis in alkaline media. The obtained FeP-350/NF showed excellent oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction performance with low overpotentials of 388 and 413 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Assembling FeP-350/NF into a two-electrode water electrolysis device only needs 1.54 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2, and there is no sign of decay in the electrolysis of water for 24 h, implying that the material has potential practical application value. Further, MIL-88A has shown good application prospects in many environmental protection fields. MIL-88A is a metal-organic framework (MOF) that is particularly easy to synthesize, and the cost of raw materials is particularly low. Most importantly, MIL-88A is nontoxic to organisms. This method with MIL-88A offers a facile and green strategy for designing not only phosphide based material but also metal oxide-based highly active bifunctional electrocatalysts system and paves the way for the future development of energy conversion systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000837581100001

Herein, we successfully achieve rope-like CuCo2O4 nanosheets directly on Ni foam, which acts as multifunctional electrodes for super-capacitor and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The rope-like nanosheets with the ultrathin thickness and large surface areas can effectively increase the number of active sites, resulting in enhanced electrochemical performances. In addition, directly growing nanostructures on conductive Ni foam can endows the electrode materials with higher conductivity and richer active sites. Consequently, obtained rope-like CuCo2O4 nanosheets show the superior electrochemical performances toward supercapacitor and OER. In detail, obtained rope-like CuCo2O4 nanosheets display a high capacity of 5.84 F cm(-2) (0.65 mAh cm(-2)) at 5 mA cm(-2), as good as good stability. The asymmetric supercapacitor made of CuCo2O4 (positive electrode) and activated carbon (negative electrode) also show a high energy density of 0.55 mWh cm(-2) at 8 mW cm(-2) power density. In addition, obtained rope-like CuCo2O4 nanosheets only require a low overpotential of 220 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, and also maintain the outstanding long-term durability. These remarkable performances of rope-like CuCo2O4 hold great promise for energy storage and conversion devices. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Markedly, the coordination cage features efficient visible light-driven water oxidation activity, and represents a unique example of calix[4]resorcinarene-based [Co4O4] cubane WOC. It afforded an optimal turnover number (TON) of 119, corresponding to a quite high turnover frequency (TOF) of 793 h(-1) and an oxygen yield of 17.0%.

Co3O4@CoO@Co@C nanocomposites had been successfully synthesized using glucose as carbon source and cobalt nitrate as metalprecurs or of Co3O4@CoO@Co@C, which has excellent electrochemical performance for LIBs, supercapacitor and OER. Three kinds of morphology samples marked by Co3O4@CoO@Co@C-2/1, Co3O4@CoO@Co@C-1/1 and Co3O4@CoO@Co@C-1/2 are synthesized due to different atomic ratio of cobalt/carbon in precursors. Electrochemical and catalytic performance of Co3O4@CoO@Co@C-2/1 nanocomposites is more excellent than Co3O4@CoO@CoC-1/1 and Co3O4@CoO@Co@C-1/2. Co3O4@CoO@Co@C-2/1 shows that discharge capacity can maintain 450 mA h g(-1) and coulombic efficiency is nearly 100% during 500 cycles for LIBs. It indicates the excellent cycling stability of Co3O4@CoO@Co@C-2/1 as electrode for supercapacitor that about 78.3% of initial specific capacitance can be retained after 10000 cycles at current density of 2 A g-1. Co3O4@CoO@Co@C-2/1 as catalyst of OER shows excellent electrochemical durability over 15 hours continuous experiment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Epitaxial thin film photoelectrodes were grown with controlled Ir valence and used to measure the electrochemical efficiency of In:SrTiO3. The positions of the in-gap Ir impurity levels were determined by optical and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies. Comparison with ab initio calculations was used to assign the observed electronic states to either Ir4+ or Ir3+ dopants in SrTiO3. The measurements show that Ir3+:SrTiO3 forms a single midgap impurity state that is strongly localized, completely quenching the photo-electrochemical response. An anodic photoresponse was seen in Ir4+:SrTiO3 under visible-light illumination up to a wavelength of 600 nm (hv = 2.0 eV). Ir4+:SrTiO3 contains an in-gap state close to the top of the SrTiO3 valence band. The performance of Ir4+:SrTiO3 in electrochemical reactions is compared with cathodic Rh3+:SrTiO3, clearly illustrating the importance of strong dopant d-electron hybridization with the oxygen 2p valence band of SrTiO3 for improving the energy conversion efficiency in SrTiO3-based photocatalysts.									48	4	0	0	2	0	51			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000341337700019

In this work, the deactivation and activity regeneration of a commercial IrOx catalyst were investigated under potentiodynamic and potentiostatic conditions in acidic media using rotating disk electrode and electrogravimetry methods. Systematic electrochemical protocols were designed to decouple reversible from irreversible activity losses. Cyclic voltammetry provided a metric of the active surface area and traced the charge growth under different oxygen evolution reaction conditions. A direct log t dependent charge growth is observed, accompanied by the same fractional kinetic activity decay under potentiodynamic conditions. The loss is essentially recoverable after electrochemical reductive treatment, however at the expense of mild material dissolution. In contrast, an extended potentiostatic operation induced irreversible intrinsic degradation after a critical time (0.5-1 h), accompanied by stability enhancement. This irreversible deactivation is attributed to a gradual transformation of the hydrated IrOx to a dehydrated condensed oxide. Our results suggest that Ir dissolution during the regenerative treatment is not prohibitive, as long as the low potential modulations are not frequent.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000806452100001	35666679

However, the intrinsic active sites and detailed mechanism of this catalyst remains unclear. We combine experimental evidence and a theoretical study to show that electrogenerated Co3+ and Co4+ species act as chemical oxidants but with distinct roles in selective HMF oxidation. It is found that Co3+ is only capable of oxidizing formyl group to produce carboxylate while Co4+ is required for the initial oxidation of hydroxyl group with significantly faster kinetics. As a result, the product distribution shows explicit dependence on the Co oxidation states and selective production of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) are achieved by tuning the applied potential. This work offers essential mechanistic insight on Co-catalyzed organic oxidation reactions and might guide the design of more efficient electrocatalysts.									33	2	0	0	2	0	32			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000682972700001	34288301

Hydrogen is a promising carbon-neutral candidate that can effectively attenuate global energy crises and provide a sustainable solution. However, large-scale hydrogen production from electrochemical water splitting is still a challenge that must proceed through the sophisticated four-electron transfer mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at an anode. Intensive research is currently proceeding to develop efficient, durable, earth-abundant, and inexpensive electrocatalysts for the OER. Inspired by synergistic effects arising due to the interfaces of heterostructures, we designed nanointerfaces between the CuO and NiO phases in CuO-NiO hybrid nanostructures formed over nickel foam (NF), which showed strong interactions. The catalyst was synthesized via the hydrothermal growth of a metal-organic framework (Cu-BDC) on NF, followed by temperature-controlled calcination. The contact angle measurement was 0 degrees, which demonstrates the superhydrophilic nature of the catalyst. The CuO-NiO/NF catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 231 mV in driving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope value of 100 mV dec(-1). The catalyst durability was measured for up to 20 h using chronoamperometry. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate the existence of strong interfacial interactions, which were confirmed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, and the results obtained from DFT are also in accordance with the experimental data.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2398-4902			WOS:000701835700001

It was found that Fe atoms existing in the Fe-MOF nanoneedles through coordination bonds were partially transformed into active FeOx species in-situ by the synergistic effect of UV and O3, because UV treatment can dissociate some coordination bonds to form free Fe ions, which are simultaneously oxidized to FeOx species by ozone. As a result, the combined UV/O3 treatment greatly reduced the resistance, increased the specific surface area and the number of active sites, and hence the increased catalytic activity and stability. Specifically, UV/O3 treated Fe-MOF nanoneedle arrays supported on nickel foam exhibited an excellent OER performance with a low overpotential (218 mV at 10 mA cm-2) and low Tafel slope (38.8 mV dec-1), outperformed the commercial IrO2 catalyst. This simple methodology developed in this study should have broad implications for the development of other new low-cost, but highly efficient, catalysts for OER and beyond.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000724712100007

The purpose of the study was to explore the suitability of these elements for modifying both the anode and the cathode catalysts in order to lower the overpotential for the oxidation of water during transient conditions. By keeping the electrode potential as close as possible to the thermodynamic potential for OER, other components in the fuel cell, such as platinum, the gas diffusion layer, and the bipolar plates, will be less prone to degradation. While Ru and Ir were chosen due to their high OER activity in aqueous environment, Ti was also included due to its ability to stabilize the OER catalysts. The 3M Pt-NSTF was selected as a stable, carbon-free substrate. The surface chemistry and the morphology of OER catalysts on Pt-NSTF were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy. The OER catalytic activity of Ru and Ir in PEMs compares well with their behavior in aqueous environment. It was found that Ru is more active than Ir, that Ir is considerably more stable, while the mass activity of both is higher in comparison with similar OER catalysts.									29	3	0	0	1	0	30			1868-2529			WOS:000312634100015

Utilizing urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with lower thermodynamic potential to replace OER provides a promising strategy to enhance the energy efficiency. Amorphous and heterojunctions electrocatalysts have been aroused extensive studies owing to their unique physicochemical properties and outperformed activity. Herein, we report a simple method to construct a novel crystalline-amorphous NiO-CrOx heterojunction grown on Ni foam for UOR electrocatalyst. The NiO-CrOx electrocatalyst displays excellent UOR performance with an ultralow working potential of 1.32 V at 10 mA center dot cm(-2) and ultra-long stability about 5 days even at 100 mA center dot cm(-2). In-situ Raman analysis and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurement verify that the presence of the amorphous CrOx phase can boost the reconstruction from NiO to active NiOOH species and enhance adsorption ability of urea molecule. Besides, the unique crystalline-amorphous interfaces are also benefit to improving the UOR performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000823385500009

Growing evidence suggests that metal catalysis was critical for the origin of the very first metabolic reactions. With approximately 80% of modern metabolic pathways being dependent on metal ions, metallocatalysis and homeostasis continue to be essential for intracellular metabolic networks and physiology. However, the genetic network that controls metal ion homeostasis and the impact of metal availability on metabolism is poorly understood. Here, we review recent work on gene and protein evolution relevant for better understanding metal ion biology and its role in metabolism. We highlight the importance of analysing the origin and evolution of enzyme catalysis in the context of catalytically relevant metal ions, summarise unanswered questions essential for developing a comprehensive understanding of metal ion homeostasis and advocate for the consideration of metal ion properties and availability in the design and directed evolution of novel enzymes and pathways.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0959-437X	1879-0380		WOS:000869041800005	36183585

Strong adhesion of metal monolayers to the WC support, accompanied by a modification of electronic structure, was evidenced. Calculated values of hydrogen binding energy on studied metal overlayers were correlated to available experimentally determined values of exchange current densities of hydrogen oxidation/evolution reaction (HOR/HER), resulting with the volcano curve with both explanatory and predictive power. None of the investigated metal/WC surfaces were found to exceed the Pt(111) surface in terms of catalytic activity toward HER/HOR. The obtained results indicate that WC may efficiently replace the precious metal support in the Pt (Pd) core-shell electrocatalyst for HER/HOR, but no synergism arising due to electronic effects of WC support was evidenced.

However, exploring non-noble-metal catalysts for replacing high-cost notable metal catalysts remains a major challenge. Herein, iron and sulfur co-doped N-enriched hierarchical porous carbon polyhedron (NC) derived from metal-organic framework (Fe/S-NC) was successfully prepared by a facile strategy, including a direct pyrolyzation of zeolitic imidazolium framework (ZIF-8) and a further pyrolysis of the impregnated NC with Fe(SCN)(3) solution. Electron microscopic studies showed that Fe/S co-doping has not changed the polyhedron morphology of NC. The resulted Fe/S-NC demonstrated obviously enhanced ORR activity, excellent durability and methanol tolerance in both alkaline and acidic media. The half-wave potential of the Fe/S-NC exhibited 32 mV positive shift in 0.1 M KOH, and only 25 mV negative shift in 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively, as compared to that of the commercial Pt/C (20% Pt loading) catalyst. The superior performance is attributable to the combined roles of the unique hierarchical porous structure of NC and the Fe/S co-doping by endowing Fe/S-NC with great specific surface area, rich active sites, excellent conductivity and synergistic effect between Fe-N-x-C active sites and a thiophene-like structure (C-S-C).

Each of them depends on the local properties of the interface, i.e, the local potential drop and the substrate orientation. To investigate the influence of the grain orientation on the local breakdown, laser induced reactions were carried out on Ti microelectrodes. On the low density (xxx0) surface, accelerated passive corrosion takes place at low potentials in acid media. The rate of depassivation by illumination was determined by repassivation experiments. At high potentials, laser oxide formation dominates At the (0001) surface, corrosion takes place at higher potentials only. With increasing pH, only laser induced oxide formation is observed. It is concluded that the orientation of the Ti grains determines the electronic properties of the oxide film. During illumination, these regulate the potential drop at the oxide/electrolyte interface which governs the rate of ITR, i.e. the onset of corrosion or oxide formation.

However, the adverse charge recombination of MAPbI(3) at the nanoscale domain hinders its photocatalytic H-2 evolution reaction (HER) performance. To address this issue, the metallic Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets is in-situ anchored on MAPbI(3) to construct stable and efficient MXene/MAPbI(3)-HI system for visible-light-driven photocatalytic H-2 evolution. The exfoliated MXene is approximate two-layer with the thickness of-2.52 nm, and a series of optical/optoelectrochemical characterizations demonstrate that the two layered MXene is capable of rapidly transporting the electrons from MAPbI(3) to effectively inhibit the charge recombination and simultaneously providing abundant active sites for H+ reduction and H-2 evolution. As a result, the photocatalytic performance of the MXene/MAPbI(3) in term of HER rate and stability is greatly promoted, with an extremely high HER rate of 3124 mu mol h-1 g(-1). This work provides a rational route on the reliable design and synthesis of high-efficiency and stable 2D electron transport/3D light absorber perovskite-based photocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000779108600002

Galvanostatic electrolyses and voltammetric experiments were carried out for iodic acid, iodic acid-lithium iodate and lithium iodate-lithium hydroxide solutions. It was found that the maximum periodate current efficiency for boron-doped diamond and lead electrodes is about 0.6 and for platinum electrodes almost zero. A reaction mechanism for the oxygen and periodate formation on the boron-doped diamond electrode in acid solution has been proposed. For a boron-doped diamond electrode in the high potential range the charge transfer coefficient and the exchange current density for the oxygen evolution are 0.14 x 10(-4) and 4 x 10(-4) A m(-2), respectively.

Although WC- and WO-type WRs have very similar spectra, WOs show a much stronger O vi lambda lambda 3811,34 emission-line feature. This has usually been interpreted to mean that WOs are more oxygen rich than WCs, and thus further evolved. However, previous studies have failed to model this line, leaving the relative abundances uncertain, and the relationship between the two types unresolved. To answer this fundamental question, we modeled six WCs and two WOs in the LMC using UV, optical, and NIR spectra with the radiative transfer code cmfgen in order to determine their physical properties. We find that WOs are not richer in oxygen; rather, the O vi feature is insensitive to the abundance. However, the WOs have a significantly higher carbon and lower helium content than the WCs, and hence are further evolved. A comparison of our results with single-star Geneva and binary BPASS evolutionary models show that, while many properties match, there is more carbon and less oxygen in the WOs than either set of evolutionary model predicts. This discrepancy may be due to the large uncertainty in the C-12+He-4 -> O-16 nuclear reaction rate; we show that if the Kunz et al. rate is decreased by a factor of 25%-50%, then there would be a good match with the observations. It would also help explain the LIGO/VIRGO detection of black holes whose masses are in the theoretical upper mass gap.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000806535800001

However, limited by the high photo generated electron-hole recombination rate and poor light trapping ability of bulk g-C3N4 prepared by thermal condensation, it remains a great challenge in boosting the photocatalytic hydrogen (H-2) evolution performance. Herein, a broom-like O-doped g-C3N4 nanoreactor (O-CN-NTs) oriented by tube-in-tube was developed for the first time through the "calcination-hydrothermal-calcination " method. The tube-in-tube nanoreactor not only can facilitate the scattering of incident light inside the cavity to enhance the utilization of light, but also can reduce the transport distance of carriers from the bulk to the surface to facilitate electron-hole separation. The morphology design of the tube-in-tube nanoreactor plays a very important role in improving the performance of photocatalytic H-2 production. Furthermore, the density functional theory (DFT) calculation results manifest that the charge redistribution around the doped oxygen atoms accelerates the separation of electron-hole. The doping of oxygen atoms in g-C3N4 nanoreactor further enhanced the photocatalytic H-2 production performance. Attributed to above advantages, the visible-light-driven (& GE;420 nm) photocatalytic H-2 production rate of O-CNNTs can achieve 13.61 mmol g(-1)h(-1), which is approximately 71.63 times that of bulk g-C3N4 (CN550).									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000771554500001

The high cost and insufficient stability of the state-of-the-art IrO2 electrocatalysts for OER have restricted their widespread applications. In this work, La1-xPrxCoO3 perovskites with different Pr doping concentrations (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1) were investigated as alternative and inexpensive OER electrocatalysts. The OER activity was observed to increase with Pr doping and was maximum at the 50 mol % doping concentration. The overpotential of La0.5Pr0.5CoO3 was reduced to 312 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2), which was significantly smaller than 371 mV of LCO and even superior to that of the commercial IrO2 catalysts (341 mV). Furthermore, La-0.5Pr0.5CoO3 showed more stable performance in long-term tests compared with Pr0.5Ba0.5CoO3 and La0.6Sr0.4CoO3. X-ray diffraction analysis showed phase transition from a rhombohedral to an orthorhombic structure with Pr doping. Based on X-ray photoelectron spectrum analysis, the enhanced OER activity of La0.5Pr0.5CoO3 was correlated to electron occupation close to the Fermi level and the hybridization of O 2p and Co 3d bands, which facilitated the electron transfer process of the OER. Our work is therefore expected to provide a facile method of designing high-performance and stable OER perovskite catalysts through an approach based on electronic occupation regulation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000703338600040

A key factor that determines the efficiency of OER in cobalt chalcogenides is the number of electrochemically accessible Co2+ sites. Here, an easy way of increasing the electrochemical accessibility of Co2+ sites in CoSe2 has been identified, which is the simple preoxidation of selenide to selenite. When screened for OER in alkali, it was found that the electrochemical accessibility of Co2+ after preoxidation of Se in CoSe2 was increased by 7.8 +/- 2 times in the first cycle and 2-3 times after activation by potential sweeping and redox cycling. The corresponding OER activation energy lowered to similar to 1/2 at overpotentials 450 mV or higher due to such preoxidation of Se. Irrespective of the lowering in the electrochemical accessibility of Co2+ sites from the 1st cycle to the 100th cycle, the overall OER activity was maintained to be the same. This is quite relatable as a major portion of Co2+ oxidized in the first cycle is shuttling between 3+ and 4+ states while evolving O-2. Altogether, preoxidation of Se in CoSe2 benefitted the realization of increased electrochemical accessibility for Co2+ sites, improved ECSA, improved charge transfer at catalytic turnover conditions, and lowered OER activation energy.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000535175400006

Compared with the fresh Fe-doped Ni2P nanocatalysts, a stable Fe-NiOOH layer was formed on the surface of Fe-doped Ni2P nanoparticles by electrochemical activation, thus promoting the charge transfer ability and surface electrochemically active sites generation for the electrochemical activated Fe-doped Ni2P nanocatalysts, ultimately accounting for the improvement of water oxidation activity, which was evidenced by cyclic voltammograms (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) as well as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) measurements. For water oxidation reaction in 1 M KOH solution, the electrochemical activated Fe-doped Ni2P nanocatalysts can attain 10 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of 292 mV with Tafel slope of 50 mV/dec, which was also much better than that of individual Ni2P, Fe2P nanocatalysts as well as commercial RuO2 electrocatalyst. Moreover, long-term stability performance by chronoamperometric and chronopotentiometric tests for the activated Fe-doped Ni2P nanocatalysts exhibited no obvious decline within 56 h. It was demonstrated that modulating the OER catalytic activity for metal phosphide by iron-doping and electrochemical activation may provide new opportunities and avenues to engineer high performance electrocatalysts for water splitting.

Previous work demonstrated that alteration of an arginine residue occurring at position 305 to serine produced a strain (R305S)with altered PSII characteristics including lower oxygen-evolving activity, fewer assembled reaction centers, higher sensitivity to photoinactivation, etc. [Biochemistry 38 (1999) 1582]. Additionally, it was determined that the mutant exhibited an enhanced stability Of its S-2 state. Recently, we observed a significant chloride effect under chloride-limiting conditions. The mutant essentially lost the ability to grow photoautotrophically, assembled fewer fully functional PS 11 reaction centers and exhibited a very low rate of oxygen evolution. Thus, the observed phenotype of this mutation is very similar to that observed for the DeltapsbV mutant, which lacks cytochrome c(550) (Biochemistry 37 (1998) 1551). A His-tagged version of the R305S mutant was produced to facilitate the isolation of PSII particles. These particles were analyzed for the presence of cytochrome c(550). Reduced minus oxidized difference spectroscopy and chemiluminescence examination of Western blots indicated that cytochrome C-550 was absent in these PSII particles. Whole cell extracts from the R305S mutant, however, contained a similar amount of cytochrome C-550 to that observed in the control strain. These results indicate that the mutation R305S in CP43 prevents the strong association of cytochrome C-550 with the PSII core complex. We hypothesize that this residue is involved in the formation of the binding domain for the cytochrome. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

To overcome this limitation, we designed phosphorus (P)-modified, nickel (Ni)-segregated platinum (Pt)-Ni nanowires as highly efficient electrocatalysts for alkaline hydrogen evolution. The segregated Ni can be evolved into Ni(OH)(x) as the active site for water splitting. Then, the modified P with high oxophilicity on the catalyst surface serves as a site to anchor OH- largely preventing the competitive adsorption of OH- and H* on active Pt sites as well as promoting the adsorption and desorption rate of H*. Consequently, it achieves excellent activity and stability in 1 M KOH with a current density as high as 42.5 mA/cm(2) (@-0.07 V-RHE) and limited overpotential decay after 18 h long-term test, outperforming most reported alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalysts.									20	0	0	0	3	0	20			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000526394000043

Herein, bifunctional electrocatalysts of the three-dimensional (3D) cobalt-nickel phosphide nanoarray in situ grown on nickel foams (CoNiP NA/NF) were synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method followed by phosphorization. Due to the unique self-template nanoarray structure and tunable multicomponent system, the CoNiP NA/NF samples present exceptional activity and durability for HER and OER. The optimized sample of CoNiP NA/NF-2 afforded a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 162 mV for HER and 499 mV for OER, corresponding with low Tafel slopes of 114.3 and 79.5 mV dec(-1), respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that modulation active sites with appropriate electronic properties facilitate the interaction between the catalyst surface and intermediates, especially for the adsorption of absorbed H* and *OOH intermediates, resulting in an optimized energy barrier for HER and OER. The 3D nanoarray structure, with a large specific surface area and abundant ion channels, can enrich the electroactive sites and enhance mass transmission. This work provides novel strategies and insights for the design of robust non-precious metal catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1422-0067		WOS:000801670100001	35628102

Reaction systems with 1620 atoms were simulated at various heating rates and temperatures from 2300 to 4300 K. We also discuss the relevance of our simulation results to previous experimental observations. The results show that the cleavages of nitrogen- and oxygen-bridge bonds are initiation reactions. Four primary formation pathways of H2O were observed, all of these reaction pathways involved hydroxyl-containing precursors. We found that at lower temperatures the primary product is H2O, whereas H-2 is dominant one and the larger carbon cluster containing graphene-related structure prefers to formation at high temperatures. We also found multiple pathways leading to formation of H-2, including intra- and inter-molecular dehydrogenation and hydrogen abstraction by hydrogen radical. Other small molecular products also found include CH4, HCN, NH3 and CO, but with an insignificant content of CO2. The formation of CH4 involves the demethylation of methyl group-containing precursor, which could evolve from methylene groups via hydrogen abstraction reaction. And the formation of CO involves the decarbonylation of carbonyl group-containing precursor, which could evolve from ether oxygen group-containing fragments and hydroxy group-containing fragments via dehydrogenation reactions. Furthermost, the primary reaction products and the observed carbon clusters containing graphene-related structure were in accordance with experimental results. In our simulations, we find that these ReaxFF-MD simulations successfully reproduce thermal decomposition processes of depolymerization, chain reaction, defunctionalization, ring formation and polycondensation of the fragments observed in various experimental studies. The agreement of these results with available experimental observations demonstrates that ReaxFF can provide useful insights into the complicated bulk thermal decomposition of organic materials under extreme conditions at the atomistic level.									10	7	0	0	0	0	14			0567-7351			WOS:000310866100006

The ultra fine size of the as-prepared catalyst (similar to 5 nm) ensures the efficient extension of active sites. Furthermore, the incorporation of orthorhombic CoP and Co2P contributes to the improvement of the inherent catalytic property. As a consequence, the as-prepared heterogeneous cobalt phosphides nanoparticles supported on carbon cloth exhibit impressive electrocatalytic activity, which only acquire a small overpotential of 90 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and present a low Tafel slope (67.9 mV dec(-1)), a large exchange current density (0.58 mA cm(-2)) as well as good durability. Therefore, this work provides a favorable guidance for exploring executable strategies to improve catalyst activity. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To solve these problems, researchers have turned their focus to a novel Li-CO2 battery (LCB). LCB has received much attention because of its high theoretical energy density and reversible CO2 reduction/evolution process. So far, the emerging LCB still faces many challenges derived from the slow reaction kinetics of discharge products. In this review, the latest status and progress of LCB, especially the influence of the structure design of cathode catalysts on the battery performance, are systematically elaborated. This review summarizes in detail the existing issues and possible solutions of LCB, which is of high research value for further promoting the development of Li-Air battery.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1527-8999	1528-0691		WOS:000820314100001	35785427

Herein, we present a two-dimensional (2D) conductive metal-organic framework consisting of M-N-4 units (M = Ni, Cu) and a hexaaminobenzene (HAB) linker as a catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction. By varying synthetic conditions, we prepared two Ni-HAB catalysts with different crystallinities, resulting in catalytic systems with different electric conductivities, electrochemical activity, and stability. We show that crystallinity has a positive impact on conductivity and demonstrate that this improved crystallinity/conductivity improves the catalytic performance of our model system. Additionally, density functional theory simulations were performed to probe the origin of M-HAB's catalytic activity, and they suggest that M-HAB's organic linker acts as the active site with the role of the metal being to modulate the linker sites' binding strength.									21	1	0	0	0	0	21			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000569268800023	32805928	
J	Yoon, Hajin; Lee, Sujeong; Oh, Sojin; Park, Heejun; Choi, Sora; Oh, Moonhyun								Synthesis of Bimetallic Conductive 2D Metal-Organic Framework (CoxNiy-CAT) and Its Mass Production: Enhanced Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction Activity								SMALL				15	17					1805232	10.1002/smll.201805232				APR 2019	2019	The development of new electrocatalysts for electrochemical oxygen reduction to replace expensive and rare platinum-based catalysts is an important issue in energy storage and conversion research. In this context, conductive and porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are considered promising materials for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to not only their high surface area and well-developed pores but also versatile structural features and chemical compositions. Herein, the preparation of bimetallic conductive 2D MOFs (CoxNiy-CATs) are reported for use as catalysts in the ORR. The ratio of the two metal ions (Co2+ and Ni2+) in the bimetallic CoxNiy-CATs is rationally controlled to determine the optimal composition of CoxNiy-CAT for efficient performance in the ORR. Indeed, bimetallic MOFs display enhanced ORR activity compared to their monometallic counterparts (Co-CAT or Ni-CAT). During the ORR, bimetallic CoxNiy-CATs retain an advantageous characteristic of Co-CAT in relation to its high diffusion-limiting current density, as well as a key advantage of Ni-CAT in relation to its high onset potential. Moreover, the ORR-active bimetallic CoxNiy-CAT with excellent ORR activity is prepared at a large scale via a convenient method using a ball-mill reactor.									61	5	0	0	0	0	63			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000472200400005	30932335

As active electrode materials, all of the prepared electrodes were tested in a three-electrode system. Among all the electrodes, NCNMS-2 exhibited a large specific capacity (1770.95 C g(-1) at a current density of 3 mA cm(-2)), a high-rate capability (1334.18 C g(-1) at 40 mA cm(-2)), and superior cycling stability (102.78% capability retention after 5000 cycles at 10 mA cm(-2)). The NCNMS-2//activated carbon battery-supercapacitor hybrid device yielded a high energy density of 30.57 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 676.06 W kg(-1) and excellent stability with a capacitance retention of 92.71% after 5000 continuous cycles at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the NCNMS-2 exhibited a small Tafel slope of 59 mV Dec(-1), and a low overpotential of 175 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The excellent electrochemical performance of the hierarchical NiCo2O4@NiMoO4 structure was attributed to its porosity and the characteristics of the 3D nanostructure subunits that possess many active reaction sites, rapid electron/ion transport, and high stability. Based on the excellent electrochemical properties, it will serve well for energy storage and conversion.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2052-1537		WOS:000768432900001

The effect of substrate temperature on the chemical, optical, surface morphological, and structural properties of the MoOx thin films was explored systematically. The substrate temperature performed a significant role in depositing MoOx films and three kinds of different precursor reaction mechanisms of PEALD-MoOx thin films handled by substrate temperature were presented firstly and illustrated comprehensively. The growth of amorphous MoOx film was observed between 150 and 175 degrees C. Moreover, an obvious transition to polycrystalline deposition was demonstrated for the deposition temperatures at 225 degrees C and higher. Both Mo6+ and Mo5+ valence states existed in all prepared MoOx films, which inferred the deficient lattice oxygen in the films. And the proportion of non-lattice oxygen reduced with the increasing deposition temperature. The elaboration of deposition mechanism of PEALD-MoOx films provides a guideline for the preparation of high-quality MoOx films.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000819283800003

The initial average chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration of the leachate was 2100 mg/L, with a biological oxygen demand (BOD5)/COD ratio of 0.08. The sequence of stages implemented was (i) Fenton oxidation, (ii) neutralization of Fenton's effluent to pH 7, and (iii) ultrafiltration with submerged membranes. The influence of different parameters, such as redox potential evolution, H2O2/COD mass ratio, and hydraulic retention time, was investigated in the Fenton oxidation process. The effect of neutralization and UF steps was also studied. COD reduction after the integrated treatment was up to 80%. The final effluent was free of solids, color, and iron. The results demonstrated the high potential of Fenton's reagent in combination with membrane filtration in the remediation of recalcitrant wastewaters on a pilot plant continuously operated.									56	4	0	0	33	0	57			0888-5885			WOS:000252777500052

This mixed chemistry is unlikely to be related to carbon dredge up, as third dredge-up is not expected to occur in the low mass bulge stars. We show that the phenomenon is widespread, and is seen in 30 nebulae out of our sample of 40. A strong correlation is found between strength of the PAH bands and morphology, in particular, the presence of a dense torus. A chemical model is presented which shows that hydrocarbon chains can form within oxygen-rich gas through gas-phase chemical reactions. We conclude that the mixed chemistry phenomenon occurring in the galactic bulge planetary nebulae is best explained through hydrocarbon chemistry ill an UV-irradiated, dense torus.					283rd Symposium of the International-Astronomical-Union283rd Symposium of the International-Astronomical-Union	JUL 25-29, 2011JUL 25-29, 2011	Int Astron Union; Spanish Minist Sci & Innovat; Isl Council TenerifeInt Astron Union; Spanish Minist Sci & Innovat; Isl Council Tenerife	Puerto de la Cruz, SPAINPuerto de la Cruz, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1743-9213	1743-9221	978-1-10701-983-6	WOS:000309944800046

Herein, we propose on a facile and robust strategy to create leaf-like porous carbon nanosheets (denoted Co,Zn/N,S-LPCS) derived from the surface engineering of ZIF-L with trithiocyanuric acid (TCA) for highly efficient ORR electrocatalyst. By optimizing Co/Zn ratio and TCA amount, the core-shelled ZIF-L-Co/Zn@TCA composite is first synthesized. Sequentially, the pyrolysis of ZIF-L-Co/Zn@TCA yields Co,Zn/N,S-LPCS with hierarchical porosity and large specific surface area. The resulting Co,Zn/N,S-LPCS electrocatalyst exhibits higher ORR performance than the counterparts of Co,Zn/NC (no TCA) and Co/N,S-LPCS (no Zn). Most importantly, the half-wave potential (E-1/2) of Co,Zn/N,S-LPCS is 30 mV larger than Pt/C in alkaline electrolyte, and close to Pt/C in acidic electrolyte. Notably, the long-time stability and anti-methanol property of the Co,Zn/N,S-LPCS largely outperform Pt/C. The Co,Zn/N,S-LPCS-based primary Zn-air battery displays a specific capacity of 808.9 mA h g(Zn)(-1) and a power density of 106 mW cm(-2). The remarkable performance of the Co,Zn/N,S-LPCS electrocatalyst stems from the synergetic effect of multi-doping, hierarchical porosity, large specific surface area and 2D leaf-like architecture.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000833287200005

In this new method, currents on IDA generator and collector electrodes for an EC' mechanism are derived from the number of redox cycles and the contribution of non-catalytic current. And the fractions of bipotential recycling species and catalytic-active species are calculated, which helps understanding the catalytic reaction mechanism. The homogeneous hydrogen evolution reaction catalyzed by [Ni(p(2)(Ph)N(2)(Bn))(2)](2+) (where p(2)(Ph)N(2)(Bn) is 1,5-dibenzyl-3,7-diphenyl-1,5-diaza-3,7-diphosphacyclooctane) electrocatalyst was examined and analyzed with IDA electrodes. Besides, the existence of reaction intermediates in the catalytic cycle is inferred from the electrochemical behavior of a glassy carbon disk electrodes and carbon IDA electrodes. This quantitative analysis of IDA electrode cyclic voltammetry currents can be used as a simple and straightforward method for determining reaction mechanism in other catalytic systems as well.

Before and after ablation, the composite exhibits excellent interfacial bonding, indicating that the presence of Mo-foil transition layer enables an optimal connection between ZZS and C/C. Additionally, SEM analysis reveals that the ZZS ceramics have a dense structure, thereby preventing oxygen from diffusing further into the matrix.

This way, a 10(3)- to 10(4)-fold increase of the half-life was reached without resource-intensive directed evolution or structure-dependent protein engineering methods. The stabilized enzymes are highly valued for their synthetic potential in biotechnology and medicinal chemistry (enantioselective sulfur, nitrogen and Baeyer-Villiger oxidations; oxidative human metabolism), but widespread application was so far hindered by their notorious fragility.

The idea of this combined system is to take advantage of the individual properties of each of the two catalyst components. We use DFT calculations to determine the stability and activity of a model hybrid water oxidation catalyst that consists of a dimeric Ir complex attached on the IrO2(110) surface through two oxygen atoms. We find that homogeneous catalysts can be anchored to oxide surfaces without a significant loss of activity. Hence, the design of hybrid systems that benefit from both the high tunability of the activity of homogeneous catalysts and the stability of heterogeneous systems seems feasible.									26	2	0	0	5	0	26			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000379531300008

We demonstrate a simple and efficient synthetic strategy for the preparation of cobalt-nitrogen codoped hierarchically porous carbon (Co-NHPC) electrocatalysts towards HER, by the direct carbonization followed by removing the Co nanoparticles. The resultant carbon-based materials were demonstrated to be three-dimensional porous graphitic structure with the highly active Co-N-C complex, leading to a high electrocatalytic activity and durability for HER in both of alkaline and acidic electrolyte. Considering the facial and rational preparation processes, the self sacrificial nanoparticle templates synthetic strategy developed in this work is promising to design other carbon-based materials for other electrochemical applications.

Flexible rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs) with high theoretical energy densities demonstrate significant potential as next-generation flexible energy devices that can be applied in wearable electronic products. The design of highly efficient and air-stable cathodes that can electrochemically catalyze both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are highly desirable but challenging. Flexible carbon-based catalysts for ORR/OER catalysis can be broadly categorized into two types: (i) self-supporting catalysts based on the in situ modification of flexible substrates; (ii) non-self-supporting catalysts based on surface coatings of flexible substrates. Methods used to optimize the catalytic performance include doping with atoms and regulation of the electronic structure and coordination environment. This review summarizes the most recently proposed strategies for the synthesis of designer carbon-based electrocatalysts and the optimization of their electrocatalytic performances in air electrodes. And we significantly focus on the analysis of the inherent active sites and their electrocatalytic mechanisms when applied as flexible ZABs catalysts. The findings of this review can assist in the design of more valuable carbon-based air electrodes and their corresponding flexible ZABs for application in wearable electronic devices.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1931-7573	1556-276X		WOS:000657735300003	34032941	
J	Papoular, R.								On the formation and abundance of CO in envelopes of asymptotic giant branch stars								MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY				390	4			1727	1732		10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13865.x				NOV 11 2008	2008	It is generally considered, as a rule of thumb, that carbon monoxide forms very early in envelopes of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, and that it consumes most of the carbon, or most of the oxygen, depending on whether the photosphere is oxygen-rich or carbon-rich, respectively. This work focuses on the latter case, with the purpose of quantifying the remaining fraction of gaseous carbon which is then available for forming carbonaceous grains. Since AGB stars are (probably) the main providers of cosmic carbon grains, this residual fraction is essential in establishing the validity of current grain models. Here, we use a kinetic treatment to follow the chemical evolution of circumstellar shells towards steady state. It is shown that the residual fraction depends essentially on the atomic ratio of pristine gaseous carbon and oxygen, and on the cross-section for CH formation by collision of C and H atoms. It lies between 55 and 144 C atoms per 10(6) H atoms, depending on the values adopted for unknown reaction rates and cosmic C abundance. This is much larger than predicted by the rule of thumb recalled above.The present results depend strongly on the rate of the reaction C+H -> CH: far from thermodynamic equilibrium (which is the case here), CO cannot be formed if this rate is as low as generally assumed. We have, therefore, estimated this rate by chemically modelling the reaction and found it indeed much higher, and high enough to yield CO abundances compatible with observations. An accurate experimental rate determination is highly desirable.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0035-8711			WOS:000260447100037

The structure of a Pt-based bimetallic nanoparticle, which is significantly affected by the catalytic properties, is reconstructed by thermal energy. We investigated the effect of structural reconstruction induced by thermal annealing on the improvement of the ORR using various physical and electrochemical methods. We found that the structural evolution of PtNi nanoparticles, i.e., the Pt-Ni ordering with the Pt shell and the surface reorientation into the (111) facet, is the source of the enhanced ORR activity as well as electrochemical stability through the thermal annealing. This result confirms the crucial factors for the ORR properties by the thermal annealing process and proposes a way to design advanced electrocatalysts.									21	3	0	0	0	0	23			1932-7447			WOS:000336198900009

In the present review, examples are given of applications of density functional theory to two mechanisms involving redox active centers. In methane monooxygenase an iron dimer complex oxidizes methane to methanol. A hydrogen abstraction mechanism is suggested involving a high-valent Fe(IV,IV) intermediate, termed Q. In Photosystem II an oxyl radical mechanism is suggested for the formation of O-2. Different models of the oxygen evolving cluster are discussed.

J	Gong, Yanmei; Zhao, Hongbin; Ye, Daixin; Duan, Hongyan; Tang, Ya; He, Ting; Shah, Luqman Ali; Zhang, Jiujun								High efficiency UOR electrocatalyst based on crossed nanosheet structured FeCo-LDH for hydrogen production								APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL				643						118745	10.1016/j.apcata.2022.118745				AUG 5 2022	2022	To improve efficiency of hydrogen production, other anodic reactions with lower theoretical potential like urea oxidation reaction (UOR) to replace OER were explored. Herein, we synthesized FeCo layered double hydroxide (FeCo-LDH) in situ on nickel foam (NF) that had excellent OER and UOR catalytic ability and durability. The good catalytic performance can be attributed to the special crossed nanosheet structured FeCo-LDH with large specific surface area, rapid electron transfer. At the current density of 50 mA cm-2, the overpotential is 228 mV during OER, and the voltage value is 1.353 V vs. RHE during UOR. When FeCo-LDH was used as electrocatalyst, the voltages required for water and urea electrolysis to reach the current density of 10 mA cm-2 are 1.523 V and 1.409 V, respectively. The strategy of constructing FeCo-LDH on NF plays an important role in high efficiency hydrogen production, and has great application prospects in sustainable energy efficient conversion.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0926-860X	1873-3875		WOS:000822713800005

The study has been carried out by combining electrochemical methods, SEM-EDS and XPS depth profiling. Both porous and compact PbO2 layers have been used as sacrificial oxides and reacted, in different experiments, with: (i) a single low-valent cation, (ii) two cations in sequential exchange reactions or (iii) two cations simultaneously. The experimental results converged to show (i) a lack of correlation between the reaction driving force and the secondary oxide growth rate, (ii) the incorporation of cations from solution at the secondary oxide/electrolyte interface, (iii) the transport of Pb species through the growing secondary oxide layer and (iv) a major effect of mass transport on the growth rate.

J	Shi, Wenjuan; Park, Ah-Hyeon; Kwon, Young-Uk								Scalable synthesis of (Pd,Cu)@Pt core-shell catalyst with high ORR activity and durability								JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				918						116451	10.1016/j.jelechem.2022.116451				AUG 1 2022	2022	Developing highly active and durable electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) remains a para -mount challenge for the commercialization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) with Pt shells hold some promises for such catalysts. In this work, carbon-supported (Pd,Cu)@Pt core-shell NPs with tunable Pt shell thickness are synthesized by reacting pre-formed PdxCuy (x/y = 1/1, 2/1, 3/1) NPs with Pt(IV) ions. PdxCuy cores are synthesized by ultrasound-assisted polyol synthe-sis (UPS) method in a single step. The thickness of Pt shell and composition of (Pd,Cu)@Pt/C catalysts and, hence, their electronic structures are significantly influenced by the composition of PdxCuy NPs used. For com-parison, PtPdCu/C catalyst is synthesized by a single-step UPS reaction. Electrochemical analysis reveals that (Pd,Cu)@Pt/C catalysts exhibit substantially enhanced catalytic activities compared to those of PtPdCu/C and Pt/C catalysts. Especially, Pd2Cu1@Pt/C catalyst with 0.4 nm thick Pt shell achieves the highest specific activ-ity (SA) (1.923 mA cmPt-2) and mass activity (MA) (0.678 A mgPt-1) at 0.9 V, which are 4.0 and 3.1 times higher than those of Pt/C catalyst. More importantly, Pd2Cu1@Pt/C catalyst exhibits superior long-term durability. After 30,000 cycles of accelerated stress test (AST), it retains 87.8% of initial MA, much higher than Pt/C (36.1%) catalyst. The present synthesis route is facile and, in principle, scalable, by which it has the potential for large-scale production for real applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000817795100004

Herein, a new design for novel HCSs-combined CMs is proposed. Remarkably, the HCSs are linear carbon bubbles linked one-by-one, arranging into necklaces decorating on the graphene microfolds. Detailed thermal analysis confirm that high tem-peratures straighten the linked carbon bubbles into bamboo-like carbon nanofibers, evidently due to the attenuation of doping degree. Benefiting from the abundant active sites of carbon bubbles, the obtained CMs exhibit satisfactory electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reactions. This work establishes a bridge to precisely control the synthesis of carbon-based hierarchical architectures.(c) 2020 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

This study demonstrates a remarkable electrocatalytic water-splitting activity in alkaline media by employing a bioinspired, noble-metal-free vitamin B12 (VB12) catalyst on a conductive graphene substrate. VB12 could inherently produce unique Co-N-4 active sites upon thermal treatment owing to its Co-centered macrocyclic corrin ring, and VB12 was further engineered to produce additional Fe-N-x sites through the incorporation of Fe as a secondary metal cation. The optimal Fe content in VB12 resulted in a high density of exposed Co-N-4 and Fe-N-x active sites. Consequently, the optimized catalyst, denoted as Fe-VB12-2@GR, demonstrated outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic performance, with overpotentials of only 120 and 300 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively, while maintaining high stability and durability over a period of 20 h. The cell voltage required for water splitting was calculated as similar to 1.65 V at 10 mA cm(-2). This work demonstrates a state-of-the-art design of a bioinspired catalyst for water electrolysis, and thus, we believe that this work has the potential to bring considerable advancements in clean and renewable energy technologies.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000722187600002

Herein, we have proposed simple strategies to construct an efficient bifunctional catalyst with the above properties with the three different morphologies (i.e., dumbbell, proximal phalanges and cinnamon granola bar-like) of strontium tungstate (SrWO4, SrW) microstructures by the coprecipitation (ST), ultra-sonication (SO), and hydrothermal (HT) methods. The physicochemical properties of SrW were investigated by XRD, Raman, FT-IR, FE-SEM, TEM and XPS analysis. Owing to their unique morphologies, the developed SrW catalysts show good HER/OER activity in the alkaline media. In particular, the SO-SrW modified electrode exhibit comparatively better performance with a lower overpotential of 0.66 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER with a small Tafel slope of 138 mV/dec, and the overpotential is 0.50 Vat a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER with a small Tafel slope of 218 mV/dec in 1 M KOH along with excellent stability. These results suggest that the microstructural properties of SrW have a significant impact on their HER/OER catalytic performances, and provide new insights into the development of SrW-based bifunctional catalysts.

Nanostructuring and appropriate material design can largely improve the performances of low-cost electrocatalysts, opening the route towards profitable mass production. Here, we report on a quantitative investigation of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on Ni-based nanowall (NW) electrodes. The NiO and Ni(OH)(2) NW films (200 or 400 nm thick) are produced by chemical bath deposition followed by calcination at 350 degrees C. The morphology and the chemical arrangement of the NW were studied, before and after the OER, by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The OER electrocatalytic activity was investigated by electrochemical measurements under alkaline conditions (1 M KOH), demonstrating a stable overpotential of 345 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1) and an O-2 turnover conversion frequency (TOF) of up to 0.18 s(-1). The quantitative measurement of active electrocatalysts, through cross-correlation of the experimental data, shows nearly 100% material utilization in the 200 nm NiO NW. In thicker NiO or Ni(OH)(2) NW films this fraction decreases below 60%, probably due to the decrease in the electric potential along the nanostructure, as revealed by numerical simulation. These data and discussion support the use of low-cost Ni-based nanostructures for high-efficiency and sustainable electrocatalysts.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13				2633-5409		WOS:000613922600039

While studies in biophysics, biochemistry, and structural and molecular biology are well known to provide deeper insight into the structure and workings of this system, it is often less appreciated that biomimetic modelling provides the foundation for interpreting photosynthetic reactions. The synthesis and characterization of small model complexes, which either mimic structural features of the OEC or are capable of providing insight into the mechanism of O-2 evolution, have become a vital contributor to this scientific field. Our group has contributed to these findings in recent years through synthesis of model complexes, spectroscopic characterization of these systems and probing the reactivity in the context of water oxidation. In this article we describe how models have made significant contributions ranging from understanding the structure of the water-oxidation centre (e.g. contributions to defining a tetrameric Mn3Ca-cluster with a dangler Mn) to the ability to discriminate between different mechanistic proposals (e.g. showing that the Babcock scheme for water oxidation is unlikely).									20	1	0	0	5	0	21			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000253117000033	17954438

In this study, both of these two processes in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution over graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) were greatly promoted with the earth-abundant ferrites (Co, Ni)Fe2O4 modification. CoFe2O4 was further demonstrated to be a better modifier for g-C3N4 as compared to NiFe2O4, due to the more efficient charge carrier transfer as well as superior surface oxidative catalytic activity. When together loading CoFe2O4 and reductive hydrogen production electrocatalyst Pt onto g-C3N4, the obtained Pt/g-C3N4/CoFe2O4 photocatalyst achieved visible-light (lambda > 420 nm) hydrogen production rate 3.5 times as high as Pt/g-C3N4, with the apparent quantum yield reaching 3.35 % at 420 nm.									86	16	0	0	9	0	87			2095-9273	2095-9281		WOS:000369929800004

It was found that the composition of mold flux particles changed after the interactions, which was resulted from the reduction of flux components by the aluminum (Al) and Ti in steel, leading to the decrease of SiO2 and the increase of Al2O3 and TiOx in flux particles. A layer of oxides was precipitated in the steel near the steel-flux interface. Al2O3 particles were firstly precipitated and then transformed into Ti-Al-O type with the decrease of the distance from the interface and the increase of reheating time, accompanying with the increase of the particle size. The precipitation of particles was estimated to result from the reoxidation of the steel matrix by the oxygen diffused from the mold flux, which would further increase the detriment of the entrapped mold flux to the cleanliness and surface quality of the rolled sheets of ULC steel.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2271-3646	2271-3654		WOS:000474598000001

Among varieties of pathways to obtain clean energy, electrochemical water splitting is a promising approach. Herein, we had successfully synthesized the NiCo2S4@porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (NiCo2S4@NCNF) nanocomposite via three successive steps consisted of in-situ oxidative polymerization, calcination, and solvothermal sulfuration reaction processes. The effect of controlled molar ratios to electrocatalytic performance was studied in detail. The optimized NiCo2S4@NCNF nanocomposite exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction with a small overpotential of 117 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). More importantly, it exhibits similar electrocatalytic activity to the initial state even after successive cyclic voltammetry scan for 3000 cycles, indicating its excellent long-term stability. The superior electrochemical performance is attributed to the developed three-dimensional (3D) network nanostructure derived from bacterial cellulose nanofibers, the highly conductive porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers, and the synergistic effect between metal Ni and Co of NiCo2S4. This study permits a new pathway to design efficient electrocatalysts based on eco-friendly materials for the production of clean hydrogen energy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Both the FE and FM properties strongly depend on the doping level of Mn atoms, which directly induces a structural phase transition from monoclinic to orthorhombic. Compared with pure La2Ti2O7 (LTO), remnant polarization decreases sharply with the doping level at first, and slightly increases when x >= 0.08, which is proposed to result from the evolution oxygen vacancies. All the doped samples exhibit weak FM property at room temperature, until the maximum can be observed for x = 0.08. Mn3+-Mn4+ double-exchange and anti-FM Mn3+-Mn3+ and Mn4+-Mn4+ super-exchange interactions are responsible for the different ferromagnetic behavior of LTMO.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-3449	1573-8663		WOS:000330216000015

Light-induced changes in the functioning of Photosystem II in isolated chloroplasts								Biophysics				34	1			74	8						1989	1989	It has been established that illumination of isolated pea chloroplasts for 1-2 min with red light of 40 W/m2 intensity at a pH of the medium of 6.0 lowers by 30-70 per cent the evolution of O2 in response to a microsecond flash at the end of the first minute of the following dark period; the return of evolution of O2 to the level observed in non-illuminated chloroplasts takes 10-15 min. It is shown that at a pH of the medium of 8.0 in the same time interval preliminary illumination does not affect the evolution of O2 in response to the flash; uptake of O2 in response to the microsecond flash in the pH range 6.0-8.0 does not change after preliminary illumination. From analysis of the induction fluorescence curves of chlorophyll of the chloroplasts it is concluded that the rate of oxidation of the components of the acceptor part of Photosystem II after switching off the acting light is the same at pH 6.0 and 8.0. The results are discussed in terms of the hypothesis on the existence of the light state of Photosystem II characterized by intensified competition between the oxidation reaction of water and cyclic electron transfer in Photosystem II on reduction of the oxidized reaction centre of this Photosystem P-680.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0006-3509			INSPEC:3616269

Kinetics of simultaneous remove chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total nitrogen (TN), as well as the improvement of the biochemical properties of the effluent were also investigated. It is shown that the BDD/Si-Ti electrode system has a high anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential (2.45V) and chlorine evolution reaction (CER) potential (1.90V), and the absolute values of anodic oxidation potential and cathodic reduction potential are higher than those of the beta-PbO_2/Ti-Ti electrode system; the degradation of COD and TN followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. The BDD/Si-Ti electrode system is more effective in COD removal and current efficiency while the beta-PbO_2/Ti-Ti electrode system is more effective in TN removal. Electrolysis at a low current density (5mA/cm~2) for 15min resulted in a rise in BOD/COD from 0.18 to 0.42 (a 1.33-fold enhancement) for the ROC for the beta-PbO_2/Ti-Ti electrode system, while the BDD/Si-Ti electrode system only showed a 0.78-fold enhancement. As a result, the BDD/Si-Ti electrode system is suitable for pollutant mineralization, and the beta-PbO_2/Ti-Ti system is more suitable for the improvement of wastewater biochemical properties.			系统比较了beta-PbO_2/Ti-Ti和BDD/Si-Ti两种电极体系处理实际印染行业反渗透浓水(ROC)的性能,考察了同步去除化学需氧量(COD)和总氮(TN)的动力学,以及对废水可生化性的改善情况.结果表明,BDD/Si-Ti电极体系的析氧电位(2.45V)和析氯电位(1.90V),以及阳极氧化电位和阴极还原电位的绝对值均高于beta-PbO_2/Ti-Ti电极体系;两种电极体系对COD以及TN的去除符合拟一级动力学,其中BDD/Si-Ti电极体系对COD去除的表观速率常数和能量利用效率均优于beta-PbO_2/Ti-Ti电极体系;而beta-PbO_2/Ti-Ti电极体系对TN去除的表观速率常数和能量利用效率更优.beta-PbO_2/Ti-Ti电极体系在5mA/cm~2的电流密度下电解15min,可使反渗透浓水BOD/COD从0.18升至0.42 (提高1.33倍),而BDD/Si-Ti电极体系仅提升0.78倍.两者相比, BDD/Si-Ti电极体系适用于矿化污染物,beta-PbO_2/Ti-Ti电极体系适用于改善废水可生化性.						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-6923			CSCD:7225098

The real application of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts mainly suffers from sluggish kinetics and high overpotential except for the Ir and Ru-based systems. However, the high cost and vulnerability of the Ir and Ru metals are the main hostiles to use them for marketization. Herein, a high-performance OER electrocatalyst consisting of NiCo alloy nanoparticles supported on high surface area N-doped porous graphene (NiCo/pNGr(75: 25)) is reported. The importance of the doped-N for achieving the uniform dispersion-cum-effective interaction of the size controlled NiCo alloy nanoparticles has been explicitly investigated by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photo electron spectroscopy, Raman, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, etc. The electrochemical analysis of NiCo/pNGr(75: 25) shows an overpotential of approximate to 260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a smaller Tafel slope of approximate to 87 mV dec(-1) and long catalytic durability. DFT calculations are done to check the interaction between the NiCo alloy nanoparticles and the defective sites of pNGr and also with the doped-N, which could be attained for maintaining long catalytic durability. Furthermore, NiCo/pNGr(75: 25) is used as an OER catalyst to fabricate an electrolyzer, which works at very low potential of 1.5 V in 1 M KOH.									44	3	0	0	0	0	44			2196-7350			WOS:000393771300013

Efficient and stable photocatalysts are desired for overall water splitting under visible light. We demonstrate that the cobalt(II) oxide (CoO)/graphitic carbon nitride (CoO/g-C3N4) composites synthesized by a one-step thermal decomposition method exhibit enhanced photocatalytic efficiency for overall water splitting without sacrificial reagents. 10% CoO/g-C3N4 exhibits optimal photocatalytic performance, where H-2 and O-2 evolution rates are, respectively, 0.46 mu mol h(-1) and 0.21 mu mol h(-1) under visible light irradiation without any sacrificial reagents. It is worth mentioning that the H-2 and O-2 production almost approaches the stoichiometric ratio 2 : 1. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of CoO/g-C3N4 may be ascribed to the efficient charge separation and fast decomposition of H2O2 by CoO.									40	5	0	0	6	0	41			2052-1553			WOS:000412776000011

However, typical heteroatom-doped methods are mostly involved in gas phase deposition or high-temperature annealing under specific gases, and need exceptional equipment and complicated technology. In this work, we explore a low temperature, thrifty, and ordinary one-step hydrothermal approach to synthesize nitrogen-sulfur dual doped reduced graphene oxide (N, S-rGO) networks at low temperature, therein thiourea was used as both nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) sources and a reducing agent to make graphene oxide (GO) reduced synchronously with N and S in situ doping into skeleton frame of GO. The synthesized N, S-rGO has large N and S proportions (2.1 at% and 3.54 at%, respectively), and high-grade sulfur-containing types (mainly-C-S-C-) and high relative percentage pyridinic-N (44.6%) and graphitic-N (33.9%). Many open edges and defects are attached on the surface of the N, S-rGO, and it is beneficial to improve the electrocatalytic activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Electrochemical tests show that the N, S-rGO has the outstanding electrical conductivity and predominant electrocatalytic activity for ORR. Its stability and methanol tolerance are greatly enhanced compared with commercial Pt/C catalyst. The low-temperature one-step method offers the probability for the preparation of N, S-rGO in electronic devices and applications in electrode materials of fuel cells.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2365-6549			WOS:000428379500049

During the process, MIL-100(Fe), a kind of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) plays a structure-directing role. It is found that F-PNG with 3-D porous structure is constituted by N-doped graphene and extremely small Fe/Fe3C particles uniformly distribute on the surface of graphene. This rationally designed F-PNG possesses excellent oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction bifunctional electrocatalytic activity. While the material is explored as a cathode of Li-O-2 batteries, it exhibits excellent electrochemical performances, delivering a discharge voltage platform of similar to 2.91 V and a charge voltage platform of similar to 3.52 V at 0.1 mA cm(-2), showing a good cycle performance and having a discharge capacity of similar to 7150 mAh g(carbon+catalyst)(-1) at 0.1 mA cm(-2). The excellent performance of the F-PNG electrode is attributed to the good catalytic activity of uniformly distributed extremely small Fe/Fe3C particles and N-doped graphene, the high electronic conductivity, and the 3-D porous structure. These results indicate that F-PNG can be an excellent cathode material for Li-O-2 batteries, and MOFs-assisted synthesis method would be a promising new strategy for the synthesis of 3-D porous graphene materials.

Optimization of ball-milling mixing parameters.								Journal of colloid and interface science				630	Pt B			269	280		10.1016/j.jcis.2022.10.086				2022-Oct-20	2022	Zn-air batteries (ZABs) are promising electrochemical devices to store energy. Metal oxide perovskites mixed with carbon materials are highlighted as interesting materials for this application because of their appropriate bifunctional performance in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The interaction between both components of the electrocatalyst is important in the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity, and the mixing method plays an important role in this interaction. Then, different mixing methods have been studied in this work (ball-milling, mortar and manual shaking). The use of different physicochemical techniques such as temperature programmed desorption (TPD), temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in the materials characterization, allows us to conclude that the mixing method strongly influences the particle size and the interaction between both components, which determine the final electrocatalytic activity. The materials prepared by ball-milling displayed the best performance. Herein, the experimental conditions were optimized to obtain electrocatalysts with enhanced electrocatalytic activity for ORR and OER. Low rotating speed, air atmosphere and low ball-milling time generate electrocatalysts with a small nanoparticle size, more homogeneous and with a higher interaction between both components, which enhances electron transfer, and consequently, the overall oxygen-involved reactions. The best electrocatalyst obtained was studied as air-electrode in a Zn-air battery and it was compared to a commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst, obtaining higher cyclability (55.2 vs 51.7%) for 30h, and higher energy density at 5mA/cm2 (764 mAh/g vs 741 mAh/g).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1095-7103		MEDLINE:36327729	36327729

However, improving the durability of such catalysts remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report on the formation of PtNi nanoparticles with an average diameter of around 10 nm embedded in few carbon layers (PtNi@C) and their ORR catalytic performance. The synthesis procedure entails the use of a solvothermal method to form 2-methylimidazole-Pt-Ni composites with a MOF-like structure (designated as MPN) followed by a thermal annealing treatment. The presence of Pt during the solvothermal process catalyzes the deposition of Ni, and the Ni in the MPN catalyzes the formation of well-graphitized carbon at a temperature as low as 400 degrees C. The PtNi@C catalyst exhibits an ORR mass activity (MA) of 0.84 A mg(pt)(-1) and a specific activity (SA) of 1.54 mA cm(-2) at 0.9 V (vs RHE), representing 6.5-fold and 8.4-fold improvement over a commercial Pt/C catalyst. More significantly, the electrochemically active surface area of the PtNi@C catalyst shows little change after 5000 cycles of potential scans between 0.6 and 1.1 V in O-2-saturated 0.1 M HCIO4. This study demonstrates the feasibility of stabilizing Pt-based nanocatalysts through graphitic carbon encapsulation.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2574-0962			WOS:000465644600052

Impressively, the FeCo/FeCoP@NMn-CNS-800-assem bled rechargeable Zn-air battery presents an open-circuit voltage of 1.522 V (vs. RHE), a peak power density of 135.0 mW cm(-2), and long-term durability by charge-discharge cycling for 200 h, surpassing commercial Pt/C + RuO2 based counterpart.

To address the question of the role of the carboxy-terminal extension in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we truncated D1 by converting codon Ser345 of the psbA gene into a stop codon. Particle gun transformation of an in vitro modified psbA gene fragment also carrying mutations conferring herbicide resistance yielded a homoplasmic transformant containing the stop codon. Since oxygen evolution capacity is not affected in this mutant as compared with herbicide-resistant control cells, the carboxy-terminal extension is dispensable for a functional photosystem II complex under normal growth conditions.									22	0	0	0	19	0	22			0167-4412			WOS:A1992JA98700006	1623177

Here the microscopic mechanisms of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on differently structured anatase surfaces in aqueous surroundings, namely, (101), (001), and (102), are determined and compared systematically by combining first-principles density functional theory calculations and a parallel periodic continuum solvation model. We show that OER involves the sequential removal of protons from surface oxidative species, forming surface peroxo and superoxo intermediates. The initiating step, the first proton removal, dictates the high overpotential. Only at an overpotential of 0.7 V (1.93 V vs SHE) does this rate-controlling step become surmountable at room temperature: the free energy change of the step is 0.69, 0.63, and 0.61 eV for (101), (102), and (001) surfaces, respectively. We therefore conclude that (i) OER is not sensitive to the local surface structure of anatase and (ii) visible light (<similar to 590 nm) is, in principle, capable of driving the photocatatlytic OER on anatase kinetically. By co-doping high-valent elements into the anatase subsurface, we demonstrate that the high overpotential of the OER can be significantly reduced, with extra occupied levels above the valence band.									271	11	0	0	27	0	276			0002-7863			WOS:000282013700052	20738085

The anion ionomer content in the catalyst layers during hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER and OER) is of ultimate significance. Herein, an in-situ half-cell analysis with reference electrodes was carried out for simultaneous potential measurements and identification of the influence of the anion exchange ionomer (AEI) content on anode and cathode performance. The measured half-cell potentials proved the influence of AEI content on the catalytic activity of HER and OER, which was supported by the rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements. Cathode overpotential of Ni/C was not negligible and more affected by the AEI content than anode with the optimized AEI content of 10 wt% while NiO anode OER overpotential was independent of the AEI content. For the same AEI content, PGM catalysts showed higher electroactivity than Ni-based catalysts for HER and OER and the cathode catalyst's intrinsic activity is of high importance in the AEM electrolysis operation. Post-mortem analysis by SEM mapping of both AEI and catalyst distributions on the electrode surface showed the effect of AEI loading on the catalyst morphology, which could be related to the electrode performance.

SrCo0.95M0.05O3-delta displays three crystalline structures depending on the dopant metals and exhibits different catalytic activities. Among the structures and properties, Co-O bond length significantly affects the lattice oxygen diffusivity and Co2+/Co3+ redox capacity, governing the overall PMS activation, and is suggested as a descriptor for PMS activation.

A systematic study that combines theory and experiments is conducted to reveal the underlying enhanced catalytic mechanism of twin-structured BiVO4. The key characteristic of twinned structures is the partial strain introduced by twin boundaries. Lattice distortion introduced by the twin boundaries leads to charge redistribution and built-in electronic fields between the twin boundaries and the bulk. The generated homojunctions possess a staggered band alignment structure, and their band offsets are increased by the Fermi-level pinning effect. The series of homojunctions in twinned structures is beneficial for facilitating charge separation. Additionally, lattice distortion around twin boundaries leads to the broken geometric symmetry of metal-oxygen polyhedrons in twinned crystals. The adsorption energies of adsorbates decrease significantly, resulting in reduction of the overpotential. The reduced overpotential favors acceleration of the oxygen evolution reaction on twinned structures.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1948-7185			WOS:000716456200018	34698498

Co-OEC prepared from MePi and operated in Pi and Bi achieves a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for water oxidation at 442 and 363 mV overpotential, respectively. The catalyst retains activity in near-neutral pH buffered electrolyte in natural waters such as those from the Charles River (Cambridge, MA) and seawater (Woods Hole, MA). The efficacy and ease of operation of anodes functionalized with Co-OEC at appreciable current density together with its ability to operate in near neutral pH buffered natural water sources bodes well for the translation of this catalyst to a viable renewable energy storage technology.									341	11	1	0	34	0	347			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000286891500025

Three stable 2D M2Si (M = Mn, Co, and Y) crystals are identified through the investigation of thermodynamic, dynamical, and thermal perspectives. Among them, Y2Si monolayer is a nonmagnetic metal, whereas Mn2Si and Co2Si monolayers are antiferromagnetic metals. The three monolayers are chemically inert to H-2 and N-2, but highly active to O-2, and only Y2Si with its surface functionalized by oxygen exhibits good thermal stability, whose magnetic and electronic properties retain its pristine counterpart. In addition, it is found that the Y2Si shows good electrocatalytic performance in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

However, very little is known about the structure of the amorphous oxide catalyst during OER, especially the structural detail of the low-atomic number groups (e.g., O, P-containing species). Herein, we report in situ stimulated Raman spectroscopy (SRS) of an amorphous cobalt oxide deposited in phosphate electrolyte (CoPi), one of the most active OER catalysts in neutral pH. In situ SRS reveals the presence of orthophosphates (PO43-) in CoPi, despite the species being unstable at the studied pH. O-18 labeling of water during the CoPi electrodeposition substantially shifts the vibrational spectra of the phosphate bands, even though the phosphate groups were not labeled. The new vibrational positions match best to the phosphate network, for example, pyrophosphates (P2O74-), implying that the phosphates polymerize like a phosphate glass. We propose that the CoPi formation starts by electro- generating high-valence Co that subsequently react with water and phosphate to form CoPi. In O-18 water, the kinetic isotope effect slows down the Co reactivity toward water. As a result, the high-valence Co reacts preferably with phosphates, polymerizing them into a phosphate network. Our finding provides a mechanistic view of how the buffer ions affect the structure of an amorphous oxide, which may explain why the activity is sensitive to the deposition procedure.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000501623100023

The discharge-recharge voltage gap of n-TiN/VC was estimated to be 1.05 V, which is 390 and 450 mV smaller than that of m-TiN/VC and VC, respectively, at 50 mA g(carbon)(-1). These indicate that n-TiN/VC can function as both an active ORR catalyst during discharge and an efficient OER catalyst during recharge.									153	16	0	0	7	0	163			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000313531600007	23289098

A three-electrode configuration was adopted, involving an electrocatalytic hydrogen-evolving electrode as cathode, an alkaline battery-type or capacitor-type anode as shuttle, and a charging-assisting electrode for electro-/photoelectrochemically catalyzing water oxidation. The conceptual battery not only synergistically outputs electricity and chemical fuels with tremendous specific energy and power densities, but also supports various approaches to be charged by pure or solar-assisted electricity.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000394572100002	27863111

Based on first-principles calculations, we theoretically explore the application potential of BC3 and NC3 nanosheets as the suitable cathode electrocatalysts. By analyzing the stable adsorption configurations of LixO2y (x = 0-4, y = 0-2) intermediates on BC3/NC3, it is confirmed that oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on BC3 follows four-electron pathway with (Li2O)(2) as the discharge product, while for ORR on NC3, (Li2O2)(2) is the discharge product following two-electron pathway. We then plot the corresponding free energy diagrams of charge/discharge processes and calculate the theoretical discharge and charge overpotentials (eta(ORR) and eta(OER)) along the optimal reaction pathways. Our results show that both the eta(ORR) and eta(OER) on BC3 are considerably low (0.21 V and 0.36 V), indicating that BC3 can serve as a high-performance cathode electrocatalyst. Meanwhile, the eta(ORR) and eta(OER) on NC3 (0.37 V and 0.95 V) are comparable to previously reported materials following two-electron pathway (such as N-doped graphene), exhibiting practical values. Both the BC3 and NC3 nanosheets are stable enough for application in Li-O-2 battery, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) isn't recommended as an organic electrolyte when BC3 works as the cathode catalyst.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000483408400013

In this work, cobalt phosphide (CoP)/BP heterostructures were electrochemically synthesized with a two-electrode system, where cobalt ions were generated in situ at a Co anode, and non-aggregated BP nanosheets (NSs) were exfoliated from the bulky BP cathode. With an electrolysis voltage of 30 V, the CoP/BP heterostructure exhibited a superior and stable OER performance (e.g., an overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is 41 mV lower than that obtained with a RuO2 catalyst). The CoOx formed in situ during the OER catalysis and remaining CoP synergistically contributed to the enhanced OER performance. The present strategy provides a new electrosynthetic method to prepare stable BP electrocatalysts and also further expands their electrochemical applications.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000639581400001	33889884

The hydrogen oxidation reaction is used as a probe for forming a complete OH adlayer, whereas the comparison of cyclic voltammetry with potential hold techniques allows the investigation of the dynamics as well as a charge balance of the processes. Comparing the different findings in a parameterized form, we are able to discern the potential regions of OH and O adlayers as well as PtO formation at quasi steady state conditions: only low amount of OH exists up to 0.7 V-RHE. Increasing the potential the OH coverage increases and a OH monolayer is formed at 0.93 V-RHE, which gradually further oxidizes to O-ad increasing the potential up to 1.08 V. above which PtO oxide is formed. Comparing the oxidation process to the oxygen reduction reaction it is shown that there is a clear correlation between the formation of a full OH adlayer and the inhibition of the oxygen reduction.

However, poor reaction efficiency remains a huge obstacle. Deep insight into the reaction mechanism of CO2, especially the active site of photocatalyst could provide scientific basis for the development of more efficient photocatalyst. The high inertness of CO2 and the multi-electron reduction feature on a photocatalyst determine high complexity of the reaction for the study. Here, pure Bismuth oxyhalides (BiOX, where X = F, CI, Br, I) with the layered structure, which were synthesized by both hydrothermal method and chemical precipitation method, were selected as model photocatalysts. The photocatalytic behaviors of the samples were evaluated by the CO2 reduction with H2O without the additional photosensitizer and sacrificial agent. The as-prepared BiOBr was observed to exhibit the best CO2 photoreduction performance under the simulated sunlight. The evolution rates of CO and CH4 are 21.6 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) and 1.2 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), respectively. The effects of water dosage, light intensity and irradiation time on the efficiency of CO2 photoreduction were investigated systematically. Interestingly, the reduction selectivity of CO2 to CO almost reaches 100% in the case of high light intensity. By combination with isotopic tracing method, electron spin-paramagnetic resonance (ESA), in-situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) characterization, positron annihilation lifetime (PAL) spectra, and Density functional theory (DFT) calculation, the oxygen vacancy mediated mechanism of photoreduction CO2 was suggested for BiOX. This work provides new information and insights to deepen the understanding for defect photocatalysis on CO2 reduction of semiconductor.									127	6	0	0	16	0	129			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000541147500005

High-active and earth-abundant cobalt phosphides are recently considered as promising candidates. However, the poor inherent electron transfer efficiency and instability hinder its further development. In this work, a novel approach was demonstrated to effectively synthesize Co2P nanoparticles wrapped in amorphous porous carbon framework (Co2P/C). Benefiting from extremely high specific surface area of porous carbon, plenty of active sites were adequately exposed. Meanwhile, unique anchoring structure between Co2P nanoparticles and amorphous carbon outerwear insured high charge transfer efficiency and superior stability of Co2P/C. Due to these favorable properties, low overpotential of 281 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 69 mV dec(-1) were achieved in resultant Co2P/C catalyst. More significantly, it only exhibited a negligible overpotential increase after 30 h stability test, and these performances entirely preceded commercial RuO2 benchmark. In summary, we proposed a simple and feasible strategy to prepare metal phosphides wrapped with amorphous porous carbon outerwear for efficient and durable electrochemical water oxidation.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2296-2646			WOS:000450872400001	30525027

Molecular catalysts have served as models to understand its mechanism, in particular the O-O bond-forming reaction, which is still not fully understood. Here we report a Ru(IV) side-on peroxo complex that serves as a 'missing link' for the species that form after the rate-determining O-O bond-forming step. The Ru(IV) side-on peroxo complex (eta(2)-1(IV)-OO) is generated from the isolated Ru(IV) oxo complex (1(IV)=O) in the presence of an excess of oxidant. The oxidation (IV) and spin state (singlet) of eta(2)-1(IV)-OO were determined by a combination of experimental and theoretical studies. O-18- and H-2-labelling studies evidence the direct evolution of O-2 through the nucleophilic attack of a H2O molecule on the highly electrophilic metal-oxo species via the formation of eta(2)-1(IV)-OO. These studies demonstrate water nucleophilic attack as a viable mechanism for O-O bond formation, as previously proposed based on indirect evidence.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1755-4330	1755-4349		WOS:000656385000001	34059808

This is the first example that the loaded Ni sites for CNT forest growth were directly converted to active species for water electrolysis rather than be removed by acid treatment, which fully utilizes Ni resources and simultaneously avoids the waste acid environmental pollution. Thanks to the promoted mass/electron transfer by the CNT forest structure and the improved intrinsic activity by the multi-interfacial synergistic effect of nickel phosphide-nitride and nickel, the resultant NiPN/Ni/CC-CNT2 shows high activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, eta(10) = 56 mV and eta(100) = 186 mV) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER, eta(10) = 204 mV and eta(100) = 266 mV) in an alkaline medium. In addition, the assembled two-electrode electrolyzer with NiPN/Ni/CC-CNT2 as both the anode and cathode delivers low cell voltages of 1.49 and 1.74 V for 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) , respectively, associated with an excellent electrocatalytic durability for overall water splitting. The developed low-cost bifunctional NiPN/Ni/CC-CNT2 outperforms most of the reported electrocatalysts in literature and performs even better than the Pt and RuO2 benchmark electrocatalysts for HER and OER, respectively, at a large current density. Therefore, the fabricated NiPN/Ni/CC-CNT2 has shown great potential for large-scale commercial production of green hydrogen as a clean and renewable fuel to support the carbon neutralization strategy.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2574-0970		WOS:000813231600001

The comparison of the voltammograms obtained with and without the dissolved H-2 and CH3OH showed a strong specific adsorption of hydrogen sulphate ion on Pt(111) and then on Pt(100) but no effect on Pt(110) in the time interval of a potential scan of 50 mV s-1. The methanol oxidation reaction proceeded ca. 80 times faster on Pt(110) than on Pt(111) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and suffered self-poisoning most strongly on Pt(110) and least on Pt(111). Common to both the hydrogen ionization and methanol oxidation reactions, a strong retardation appeared in a potential region just before the commencement of the oxygen wave on the respective planes in H2SO4 and HClO4 solutions. A compact reorientation of the water molecule in this potential region is discussed as a candidate for the retardation.									48	0	0	0	2	0	48			0022-0728			WOS:A1994PB51000021

Observation of multi-electron and metal and/or ring based reduction reactions at low potentials indicated the worthy of these complexes as functional materials. Shifts of proton reduction potentials toward more positive values in solutions involving MPc indicated homogeneous electrocatalytic activities of the complexes for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

The modified Glassy Carbon Electrode (GCE)/PANI-N-3/TA-CoPc and GCE/PANI-N-3/TA-ZnPc electrodes were characterized using voltammetric techniques and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), then tested as heterogeneous electrocatalyst for HER. GCE/PANI-N-3/TA-CoPc electrodes especially decrease the over-potential of the bare electrode about 216 mV and increase the efficiency of the electrode about 32 fold at low pHs.

Constructing a heterogeneous Co-Ni-M/oxide interface (M = O, S, P and Se) would be a promising approach to enhance the water splitting performance of Co-Ni-M (M = O, S, P and Se) samples in an alkaline medium, however, that it remains unexplored and challenged. In this paper, the Co-Ni-M@CeO2/NF (M = O, S, P and Se) electrodes was firstly in situ grown on three-dimensional (3D) conductive nickel foams (NF) support through selective sulfuration, phosphorization and selenylation of the Co-Ni-O@CeO2 under a N-2 atmosphere. The Co-Ni-S@CeO2/NF display superior oxygen evolution reaction performance with requiring overpotential of 170 mV@20 mA cm(-2) and Co-Ni-P@CeO2/NF display excellent hydrogen evolution reaction activity with requiring an overpotential 120 mV@10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline medium. What's more, an electrode pairing of Co-Ni-S@CeO2/NF//Co-Ni-P@CeO2/NF was assembled for overall water splitting using the Co-Ni-S@CeO2/NF material as anodic catalyst together with the Co-Ni-P@CeO2/NF material as efficient cathodic catalyst. The assembled alkaline electrolyzer required a relatively small cell voltage of 1.60 V to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is one of the best electrocatalytic activities reported so far. The Co-Ni-S@CeO2/NF//Co-Ni-P@CeO2/NF also displayed relatively satisfactory durability and the current density had no significant attenuation during a 10 h electrocatalytic measurement in 1.0 M KOH. This selective sulfuration, phosphorization and selenylation strategy is effective in developing the M hybrid/oxide interface (M = O, S, P and Se) for overall water splitting applications.

The present work reported the mechanistic and kinetic analysis of ethylbenzene oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions on heteroatom (N or B) doped and undoped carbon nanotube (CNT) catalysts via active site titration, kinetic isotope effect and single reactant surface reaction experiments etc. The physical-chemical meanings behind the elementary step rate and equilibrium constants were revealed and applied for interpretations of the promotion effect of heteroatoms at molecular level. Nitrogen doped CNT exhibited both higher rate and equilibrium constants for C-H bond dissociation and O-2 adsorption than undoped one via facilitating the electron transfer process. The evolution of the active sites could be quantitatively described with rate equation via the theory of most abundant surface intermediates, which provides in depth understandings on the mechanism and structure-function relations in carbon catalyzed redox reactions.									28	1	0	0	1	0	28			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000487570000040

Many efforts have focused on the development of broad-band response nanomaterials. Here, we propose an alternative approach wherein, over Ni2P/TiO2 nanoparticles without noble metal, the UV-vis part of solar energy was absorbed and converted by a semiconductor and its infrared part was separately collected and converted into thermal energy to heat the photocatalytic reaction to a certain temperature. The photothermocatalytic hydrogen activity was 3.6 times that of the sum of the photocatalytic and thermocatalytic reactions. The in situ generated oxygen vacancies in Ni2P/TiO2 during the photothermocatalytic reaction were found to be responsible for the enhanced activity. Moreover, the photocurrent transient response results revealed the faster transfer of electrons from TiO2 to Ni2P at higher temperature which is vital for the significantly enhanced photothermocatalytic hydrogen production. The long-term test also shows the stability of the proposed reaction system.									39	1	0	0	2	0	40			0888-5885			WOS:000435525200014

An aqueous solution of Cu (OAc)(2) with the equilibrium pH value and a colloidal solution containing IROx center dot nH(2)O nanoparticles and H2IrCl6 (OH)(6 )with pH = 10.5 obtained by hydrolysis of H2IrCl6 in a NaOH solution were used as reagents. The nanocrystals were investigated by SEM, EDX, TEM, HRTEM, XPS, XRD, and FTIR spectroscopy. As a result of a sequential and repeated treatment of titanium foil according to the SILD method with the reagent solutions, a nanolayer of Cu0.3Ir(OH)(x) nanocrystals is formed on its surface, which, after heating at a temperature of 200 degrees C, transforms into a porous nanolayer consisting of ultrafine Cu0.3IROx center dot nH(2)O nanocrystals. They have a distorted crystal structure similar to that of rutile with sizes of 2-3 nm and form polycrystals with a thickness of 4-8 nm and lateral sizes of 40-60 nm on the substrate surface. The porous nanolayers of such polycrystals exhibit electrocatalytic properties in the oxygen evolution reaction during acidic water electrolysis. In a series of samples synthesized as a result of 10-30 SILD cycles, the best electrochemical characteristics are demonstrated by a sample acquired after 20 synthetic cycles: the overpotential value is 256 mV and the Tafel slope is 41.4 mV/ dec. These results are an experimental validation of a new approach in the search for highly efficient electrocatalysts based on the study of electrochemical properties in a series of samples synthesized as a result of a varying number of SILD cycles and the selection of samples with the best properties.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000542949400058

Manganese-based Materials Inspired by Photosynthesis for Water-Splitting								MATERIALS				4	10			1693	1704		10.3390/ma4101693				OCT 2011	2011	In nature, the water-splitting reaction via photosynthesis driven by sunlight in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria stores the vast solar energy and provides vital oxygen to life on earth. The recent advances in elucidating the structures and functions of natural photosynthesis has provided firm framework and solid foundation in applying the knowledge to transform the carbon-based energy to renewable solar energy into our energy systems. In this review, inspired by photosynthesis robust photo water-splitting systems using manganese-containing materials including Mn-terpy dimer/titanium oxide, Mn-oxo tetramer/Nafion, and Mn-terpy oligomer/tungsten oxide, in solar fuel production are summarized and evaluated.

The applicability of the method is demonstrated on the study of oxidation induction periods of edible oils and polyolefines. In all cases, the parameters of an Arrhenius-like equation describing the temperature dependence of induction period have been obtained. It is shown that the method gives the parameters not affected by oxygen diffusion which are transferable to be used in modelling the non-isothermal induction periods where the effects of diffusion, heat transfer and evolution of reaction heat are explicitly involved. A method of estimating the residual stability after a thermooxidative stress of the material is suggested.									85	1	0	0	12	0	87			1388-6150			WOS:000168679600047

Also examined is the effect of applied current density. A current efficiency of 14.6% was obtained for the Fe(III)-doped PbO2 film electrode deposited on an internally cooled (10-degrees-C) tubular titanium substrate at a current density of 200 mA cm-2 as compared to only 6.1% at the undoped PbO2 electrode under the same conditions. This result is tentatively explained on the basis of a mechanism involving the transfer of oxygen from hydroxyl radicals adsorbed on Pb(IV) sites adjacent to Fe(III) sites to O2 adsorbed at the Fe(III) sites in the surface of the Fe(III)-doped PbO2 electrodes.									65	4	1	0	9	1	69			0013-4651			WOS:A1994PM01300023

In comparison, the creation of less expensive semiconductors (metal oxides) with strong plasmonic absorption is an appealing option, particularly defective molybdenum oxide (HxMoO3-y) has received considerable attention and investigation as a promising plasmonic material for a variety of catalytic reactions (photocatalysis, thermocatalysis, photothermal catalysis, etc.).The LSPR effect of HxMoO3-y can be tuned throughout a broad spectrum range from visible to near-infrared (NIR) by altering the doping amount by electrochemical control, chemical reduction, or photochemical control. Notably, defects (oxygen vacancies) in HxMoO3-y arise in conjunction with the LSPR effect, resulting in the formation of unique and useful active sites in a range of catalytic processes. In this review, we explore the formation mechanism of HxMoO3-y with plasmonic features and discuss its applications in photocatalysis, thermocatalysis, and photothermal catalysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000828207400001	35861347

In this work, we report a carbon-doped Co-FeS2/CoS2 (C/Co-FeS2/CoS2) electrode, prepared via a hydrothermal process with carbon cloth (CC) as the substrate and carbon doping. The C/Co-FeS2/CoS2 electrode shows excellent catalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with an overpotential of 88 mV at a current density of -10 mA.cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The Tafel slope is 66 mV.dec(-1). Such superior performance is attributed to the high electrical conductivity of the electrocatalyst and its synergy with the substrate.

However, the same photochemical models also predict high concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) in the corresponding atmospheres. Here we use a line-by-line radiative transfer model to investigate the observation requirements of O-2 and CO in such atmospheres. The results show that photochemically produced CO can be readily detected at 1.58, 2.34, and 4.67 mu m. We suggest that future missions aiming at characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres consider detections of CO as an anti-biosignature. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We herein propose cyano defect and potassium intercalation modified g-C3N4 photocatalysts in which the porous structure and crystallinity can be maintained relatively well. Simultaneously, the photo-catalysts possess adjustable band structure, enhanced carrier transfer efficiency and highly selective dual-electron O-2 reduction. The physicochemical properties and reaction mechanisms are well studied through the effective combination of experiments and theoretical calculations. The H2O2 yield of KDCN-0.2 (278.9 mu mol L(-1)h(-1)) is approximately 4.3 times higher than that of original CN (65.2 mu mol L(-1)h(-1)), and the energy conversion efficiency is also higher than many current CN-based photocatalysts. This work deepens the understanding of the mechanism of photocatalytic O-2 reduction for H2O2 production and points out the promising direction for the design of novel CN-based photocatalysts with ideal properties in energy conversion and environmental applications.									19	0	0	0	5	0	19			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000718304900004

Due to the large surface area and pore volume, richness of defects existing the carbon nanotubes, interaction of S species and N species and special direction of electron transfers between Co and S ions, the earth-abundant and low-cost CoSMe-0.5-800 presents a highly efficient ORR activity and stability. The onset potential, half-wave potential and limiting current density of CoSMe-0.5-800 are 0.95 V, 0.85 V, and 4.31 mA cm(-2), which are higher than that of commercial Pt/C (0.93 V, 0.83 V, 4.19 mA cm(-2)). More importantly, the interaction between N and S heteroatoms in system gets revealed, that S resources can help to improve the degree of N doping and raise the ratio of pyridinic N species working as the active site for ORR. With the increase of S resources, electrons that should have been transferred from cobalt to sulfur have moved in the opposite direction, which has a negative effect on ORR active performance. This work shows the potential to design advanced Co-based N, S co-doped catalysts with high electrochemical performance and low cost, which could be applied for fuel cells and other devices.									8	3	0	0	1	0	9			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000517212500023

Herein, the NiF2/Ni2P hybrid catalyst, in which covalent and ionic bonds co-existed, was found to be a very active catalyst for these electrochemical reactions occuring during the electrolysis of water. The bonding states of the covalent and ionic bonds were verified by the crystal structure and surface chemical state revealed by spectral analysis. As a bifunctional catalyst for the electrooxidation of water and urea, the NiF2/Ni2P hybrid structure demonstrated higher catalytic activity, kinetics and stability in the catalytic reaction than the individual components NiF2 and Ni2P under the same conditions. Specifically, an overpotential as low as 283 mV could drive the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction, significantly lower than the overpotential required for the NiF2 (393 mV) and Ni2P materials (342 mV); the maximum current density for urea electrooxidation could reach 157.35 mA cm(-2) at 1.53 V, which was much higher than those of NiF2 (23.55 mA cm(-2)) and Ni2P (102.72 mA cm(-2)). The catalytic performance also outperformed those of the recently reported similar advanced catalysts, and the high performance could be attributed to the highly exposed active sites, rough surface area, excellent charge transfer ability, and especially, the synergistic effects between the covalent and ionic bonds in the catalyst system. Using a commercial Pt/C catalyst as a cathode, the cell potential for urea-assisted water electrolysis could be reduced to 1.5 V to obtain the current density of nearly 40 mA cm(-2) in a two-electrode system (Pt/C||NiF2/Ni2P), about 300 mV less than that required for water electrolysis in the general alkaline electrolyte. The current study demonstrates the significance of bonding state synergy in an advanced catalyst for water electrolysis and sheds some light on catalyst development in energy chemistry.									69	5	0	0	14	0	70			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000483691300025	31424469

In this work, atomic-level P-doped Pt nanodendrites (PtP NDs) with tunable composition and highly branched architecture are successfully prepared by post-phosphating reaction of sodium hypophosphite monohydrate at room temperature. Due to its electrophilic properties, P effectively regulates the electronic structure of the d-orbitals of Pt. The charge change induced by P on a local scale can effectively regulate the selective adsorption of electrocatalytic reaction intermediates. The electrocatalytic results show that the eta(10) value of PtP NDs in hydrogen evolution reaction is only 13.3 mV, and the mass activity of PtP NDs in methanol oxidation reaction is 4.2 A mg(-1), which is 3.8 times larger than that of commercial Pt/C. Most importantly, the atomic-level P doping greatly improves the stability of PtP NDs, which is crucial to facilitating the catalysts' commercialization process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000853203700001

We investigated their interactive effects on Saccharina japonica (Laminariales, Phaeophyta) under two pH conditions [Low, 7.50; High (control), 8.10] and three NH4+ concentrations (Low, 4; Medium, 60; High, 120 mu M). The degree of variation of pH values in the culture medium and inhibition rate of photosynthetic oxygen evolution by acetazolamide were affected by pH treatments. Relative growth rates, carbon, nitrogen, and the C:N ratio in tissue samples were influenced by higher concentrations of NH4+ . Rates of photosynthetic oxygen evolution were enhanced under elevated CO2 or NH4+ conditions, independently, but these two factors did not show an interactive effect. However, rates of NH4+ uptake were influenced by the interactive effect of increased CO2 under elevated NH4+ treatment. Although ocean acidification and eutrophication states had an impact on physiological performance, chlorophyll fluorescence was not affected by those conditions. Our results indicated that the physiological reactions by this alga were influenced to some extent by a rise in the levels of CO2 and NH4+ . Therefore, we expect that the biomass accumulation of S. japonica may well increase under future scenarios of ocean acidification and eutrophication.									4	1	0	0	4	0	4			1738-5261	2005-7172		WOS:000445435100005

Herein, NiMnO(x)nanosheets with rich defects were electrochemically deposited on the surface of Cu(OH)(2)nanowires followed by a thermal treatment process to form a CuO(x)nanowires@NiMnO(x)nanosheets (CuO(x)NWs@NiMnO(x)NSs) electrocatalyst with a core-shell configuration. Structural characterization indicated that NiMnO(x)nanosheets had numerous vacancies with scattered defects and dislocations with partial cracking of the inert basal planes, resulting in extra active edge sites and a coordination-unsaturated spinel crystal. As such, the valence states of Ni and Mn elements became unstable in the defect modified NiMnO(x)materials under the applied potential. Compared with the initial NiMnOx, more Ni(3+)and Mn(4+)were formed during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) whereas they were converted to Ni(2+)and Mn(3+)during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). These controllable valence state changes of metal elements endowed the NiMnO(x)with high ability for catalyzing overall water electrolysis. As a result, the CuO(x)NWs@NiMnO(x)NSs bifunctional electrocatalysts exhibited high performances in both HER and OER in an alkaline electrolyte. Meanwhile, by using the same electrocatalysts in a neutral electrolyte, overpotentials at 10 mA cm(-2)were also as low as 80.7 and 390 mV with Tafel slopes of 77.6 and 101.6 mV dec(-1)for the HER and OER, respectively. A two-electrode overall water electrolysis system using this bifunctional electrocatalyst exhibited low cell voltages of 1.62 and 1.75 V in alkaline and neutral electrolytes respectively at the standard current density of 10 mA cm(-2)with long-term stability, indicating that this CuO(x)NWs@NiMnO(x)NSs core@shell-type material should be an effective bifunctional electrocatalyst in both alkaline and neutral pH media.									22	1	0	0	1	0	22			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000561168500030
