Results showed that both the coal pyrolysis characteristics and the evolution kinetics of H2 are strongly related to the first coalification jump, which is demonstrated by three aspects: the weight loss rate indicates an abrupt change at C-daf=80% (R-max(0)=0.60%) (C-daf is carbon content (mass fraction) of sample in dry-ash-free basis, R-max(0) is the maximum reflectance of vitrinite in coal); the characteristic temperatures and kinetic parameters of H-2 exhibit a minimum value at C-daf=80% (R-max(0)=0.60%); the total yield of hydrogen had a maximum value at C-daf=80% (R-max(0)=0.60%) and this is consistent with the initial point of the first coalification jump. These aspects indicate that the derived parameters can reveal the first coalification jump. Combined with the structural characterization of the coals by FTIR, a mechanism that explains the results was determined using the following three factors: (1) the evolution characteristics of aliphatic oxygen-containing functional groups; (2) the retrogressive reaction of soluble organic matter and (3) the 11 polarization" of organic matter.									8	6	0	0	0	0	12			1000-6818			WOS:000272817500032

The behavior and mechanism of the inactivation of Ti/PbO2 anodes were studied by the accelerated life test, electrochemical impedance spectrum, XRD and SEM-EDX. The results showed that the inactivation of Ti/PbO2 anodes was a developing process. During oxygen evolution, partial active oxygen atoms produced as intermediate product diffuse toward Ti substrate, and they oxidize Pb3+ to Pb4+ in the PbO2 coating to occupy gradually the oxygen vacancies as free electron donors. This resulted in not only the decrease of conductivity but also a change of intrinsic stresses from tensile stresses to compressive stresses. When the process was finished on the whole, large numbers of active oxygen atoms began to diffuse to Ti substrate. The oxidation of Ti substrate led to the production of an interfacial stresses. Under the effects of compressive intrinsic stresses and interfacial stresses, PbO2 coating knobs out, subsequently flakes off and Ti/PbO2 anodes become inactive rapidly.									10	17	0	0	0	0	20			1000-6818			WOS:000250412100006

The ultimate tensile strength and elongation of the samples fabricated with the atmospheric oxygen content below 20 ppm (LOC samples) are 10.89% and 128.21% higher than those of the samples fabricated with the atmospheric oxygen content below 200 ppm (HOC samples), respectively. By comparing the formability, density, microstructure, phase and fracture surface of the HOC samples and the LOC samples, it is found that the earlier fracture is caused by the larger size particles forming during the process. The chemical reaction rate dramatically increases as the atmospheric oxygen content increases. The closer particles and the longer duration of high temperature of the molten pool make the collision of the particles easier, resulting in the formation of the larger particles. These findings indicate the atmospheric oxygen plays a different role when alloys with high oxygen sensitivity are being selective laser melted. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Engineering nanocrystals with desired structures and properties is no doubt one of the most important challenges in the field, which requires deep insight into atomic-scale dynamics of nanocrystals during the process. Intermetallic compounds have drawn increasing interests in heterogeneous catalysis due to their unique geometrical and electronic structure, which enable the high selectivity and stability in catalytic reaction. Compared with monometallic and random alloyed catalysts, the precise structural control during the synthesis of intermetallic nanocrystals is no doubt one of the most important issues in catalysis but is still a challenge. Here, we summarized recent progresses in designing intermetallic nanocrystals with well-defined structures and categorized them into different entries, clarifying the most adopted strategies. Then, we discussed various structural evolutions of intermetallic compounds that occurred in the reaction conditions, which are of great significance for deep understanding of the active sites and structure-activity relationship of intermetallic nanocatalysts. In the end, we pointed out the challenges of existing progress and proposed prospects for future direction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2162-8769	2162-8777		WOS:000867384000001

Developing highly efficient and earth-abundant electrocatalysts however remains one of the grand challenges. Herein, we developed biomass (duckweed, DW) derived N,S-doped mesoporous carbon matrix supported NiFe-alloy nanoparticles (NPs) as efficient electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. While the annealed catalyst required 267 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER, the best HER performance was demonstrated by the unannealed electrocatalyst requiring 106 mV at -10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. For overall water splitting, this couple required only 1.61 V cell voltage to deliver 10 mA cm(-2), with continuous release of O-2 and H-2 gas bubbles for more than 200 h. On integrating with perovskite solar cells, the homologous DW electrolyzer exhibited unassisted solar-energy-driven overall water splitting with a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 9.7%.									36	2	0	0	3	0	36			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000448412000022

The efficacy of water splitting strongly depends on the performance of electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a unique space-confined earth-abundant electrocatalyst having the bifunctionality of simultaneous hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), leading to high efficiency water splitting. Outperforming Pt/C or RuO2 catalysts, this mesoscopic, space-confined, bifunctional configuration is constructed from a monolithic zeolitic imidazolate framework@layered double hydroxide (ZIF@LDH) precursor on Ni foam. Such a confinement leads to a high dispersion of ultrafine Co3O4 nanoparticles within the N-doped carbon matrix by temperature-dependent calcination of the ZIF@LDH. We demonstrate that the OER has an overpotential of 318 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), while that of HER is 106 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2). The voltage applied to a two-electrode cell for overall water splitting is 1.59 V to achieve a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) while using the monolithic catalyst as both the anode and the cathode. It is anticipated that our space-confined method, which focuses on earth-abundant elements with structural integrity, may provide a novel and economically sound strategy for practical energy conversion applications.									84	4	0	0	4	0	84			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000414115700030	28991435

Herein, a series of Pd-Sn bimetallic nanocrystals with hollow structure have been successfully created as highly active and selective catalysts for direct H2O2 synthesis. We found that the introduction of Sn played an important role on the morphology evolution and composition control of the hollow Pd-Sn nanocrystals. Significantly, after rapid thermal treatment, the obtained hollow Pd-Sn/TiO2 catalysts can deliver complete inhibition of H2O2 decomposition/hydrogenation, resulting in a large activity enhancement for the H2O2 production. The H-2 selectivity could be further improved by using water as the reaction solvent. Further investigation showed that the large activity enhancement of hollow Pd-Sn/TiO2 catalysts for the direct H2O2 synthesis can be attributed to the presence of PdO, the ensemble effect between the Pd and Sn, and the interface effect of Pd/SnOx and PdO/SnOx.									68	4	0	0	4	0	69			2155-5435			WOS:000430154100088

Here, a facile and scalable approach is demonstrated to prepare efficient and robust freestanding cathode catalyst that consists of dispersed Fe3C nanoparticles, rich Fe-N-x/N-C species and carbon fibers networks with large specific surface area, which is based on one-pot in-situ coupling of Fe and N induced active sites within bacterial cellulose-derived carbon fibers networks. Its bifunctional activity parameter (Delta E) for ORR and OER is 0.79 V, superior to those of single Fe- or N- modulated counterparts, and comparable to the state-of-the-art Pt/C + RuO2 catalyst (0.79 V). This material can be directly used as freestanding and binder-free catalyst layer, and as-assembled ZABs exhibit a larger peak power density (173 mW cm(-2)), higher specific capacity (717 mA h g(-1), 10 mA cm(-2)) and better cycle stability (negligible activity decay after 165 h charge/discharge cycles) than those of Pt/ C + RuO2-based devices, representing their potential applications in advanced energy conversion systems.

However, their rational design and construction remain quite challenging due to the poorly understood structure-function relationship. Here we demonstrate the dynamic behavior of CuN2C2 site during operando oxygen reduction reaction, revealing a substrate-strain tuned geometry distortion of active sites and its correlation with the activity. Our best CuN2C2 site, on carbon nanotube with 8 nm diameter, delivers a sixfold activity promotion relative to graphene. Density functional theory and X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveal that reasonable substrate strain allows the optimized distortion, where Cu bonds strongly with the oxygen species while maintaining intimate coordination with C/N atoms. The optimized distortion facilitates the electron transfer from Cu to the adsorbed O, greatly boosting the oxygen reduction activity. This work uncovers the structure-function relationship of single-atom catalysts in terms of carbon substrate, and provides guidance to their future design and activity promotion.The rational design of single-atom catalysts is challenging. This work reveals a substrate-strain tuned geometry distortion of CuN2C2 single-atom site, which greatly boosts oxygen reduction activity by facilitating electron transfer to adsorbed O.									20	1	0	0	1	0	19				2041-1723		WOS:000714451200024	34732747

However, the synthesis of such electrocatalysts by a simple and environmentally friendly method is still a tremendous challenge. Herein, NiSe nanoparticles were in situ deposited on the reduced graphene oxide-polyimide/carbon nanotube (RGO-PI/CNT) film by a green electrodeposition method. The NiSe nanoparticles on the RGO-PI/CNT (NiSe-RGO-PI/CNT) film was employed directly as a highly active HER electrocatalyst. The RGO-PI/CNT film allowed NiSe nanoparticles to grow rapidly on its surface. NiSe nanoparticles with a small size of 35-45 nm were distributed uniformly on the surface of the RGO-PI/CNT film. The good dispersity of NiSe nanoparticles permitted the exposure of more active sites, which enhanced the activity of HER on the NiSe-RGO-PI/CNT film. The NiSe-RGO-PI/CNT film performed well HER behaviors featured by a low overpotential (270 mV), a small Tafel slope (61 mV dec(-1)) and a considerable stability. The efficient HER performance of the NiSe-RGO-PI/CNT film was originated from the synergistic effect between the RGO-PI/CNT film and NiSe nanoparticles. This exploration provided a straightforward and green method to prepare a film electrocatalyst for HER. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, a stainless steel (SS) electrode has been modified using nickel phosphide (NiP) nanoparticles on its conductive surface through a fast and simple one-step electrodeposition process and utilized as a non-precious, binder-free, and robust electrode towards the OER and HER in alkaline solution. The deposition time was studied to examine its influence on the morphology of xNiP@SS (x refers to deposition time) and the corresponding catalytic performance of the OER and HER in 1.0 M KOH solution. Taking advantage of the superior morphology (homogeneity of the deposition and high porosity) with a high electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and excellent contact at the substrate/catalyst interfaces, the optimized xNiP@SS electrode exhibited excellent OER performance by achieving overpotentials of 238 and 271 mV at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, with a Tafel slope of 41.24 mV dec(-1). For the HER, an overpotential of 268 mV can be reached at 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 70.5 mV dec(-1). The modified electrode showed higher stability for both reactions under the relevant electrolysis conditions for the OER and HER for 24 hours. Furthermore, an experimental lab electrolyzer based on the modified xNiP@SS electrodes as the anode and cathode has been tested, achieving a voltage of 1.77 V at 10 mA cm(-2). This work presents a rapid and straightforward strategy for the modification of the SS surface with metal phosphide to afford cost-effective, highly efficient, and stable electrodes for the OER and HER in water electrolyzer systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000754011500001		
J	Bernhardt, Harold S.								The Juxtaposition of Ribose Hydroxyl Groups: The Root of Biological Catalysis and the RNA World?								ORIGINS OF LIFE AND EVOLUTION OF BIOSPHERES				45	1-2	SI		15	19		10.1007/s11084-015-9403-z				JUN 2015	2015	We normally think of enzymes as being proteins; however, the RNA world hypothesis suggests that the earliest biological catalysts may have been composed of RNA. One of the oldest surviving RNA enzymes we are aware of is the peptidyl transferase centre (PTC) of the large ribosomal RNA, which joins amino acids together to form proteins. Recent evidence indicates that the enzymatic activity of the PTC is principally due to ribose 2'-OHs. Many other reactions catalyzed by RNA and/or in which RNA is a substrate similarly utilize ribose 2'-OHs, including phosphoryl transfer reactions that involve the cleavage and/or ligation of the ribose-phosphate backbone. It has recently been proposed by Yakhnin (2013) that phosphoryl transfer reactions were important in the prebiotic chemical evolution of RNA, by enabling macromolecules composed of polyols joined by phosphodiester linkages to undergo recombination reactions, with the reaction energy supplied by the phosphodiester bond itself. The almost unique juxtaposition of the ribose 2'-hydroxyl and 3'-oxygen in ribose-containing polymers such as RNA, which gives ribose the ability to catalyze such reactions, may have been an important factor in the selection of ribose as a component of the first biopolymer. In addition, the juxtaposition of hydroxyl groups in free ribose: (i) allows coordination of borate ions, which could have provided significant and preferential stabilization of ribose in a prebiotic environment; and (ii) enhances the rate of permeation by ribose into a variety of lipid membrane systems, possibly favouring its incorporation into early metabolic pathways and an ancestral ribose-phosphate polymer. Somewhat more speculatively, hydrogen bonds formed by juxtaposed ribose hydroxyl groups may have stabilized an ancestral ribose-phosphate polymer against degradation (Bernhardt and Sandwick 2014). I propose that the almost unique juxtaposition of ribose hydroxyl groups constitutes the root of both biological catalysis and the RNA world.

Platinum loaded GMS (Pt/GMS) was prepared as electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) measurement and compared with platinum loaded Ketjen black (Pt/KB). ORR activity was evaluated by rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) method to analyze hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) evolution behavior as an indicator of ionomer coverage on Pt. It was found that the ORR area specific activity of Pt/GMS was 1.2 times higher than that of Pt/KB with less H2O2 yield, mainly attributed to the lower ionomer coverage at Pt/GMS. It was also observed by transmission electron microtomography (3D-TEM) that Pt/GMS has a lot of pores between the sponge-like mesoporous framework with Pt nanoparticles therein. On the other hand, Pt/KB showed smoother agglomerate shapes with Pt nanoparticles inside the KB agglomerates mainly. Considering the frame-like mesoporous carbon network having hydrophobic basal nanosurface of the graphene of GMS and the aqueous electrolyte in this system, it is concluded that the ionomer can form self-aggregation with its hydrophobic domain inside, resulting in ineffective coverage of the ionomer on the nanostructure of GMS and the Pt nanoparticles in the GMS agglomerates.

Herein, the relationship between molecular structures of PANI precursors and the activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of the derived Fe-N-C catalysts is investigated. The PANI molecular structure, especially the content of quinoid rings (QR), is controlled by varying molar ratios of ammonium persulfate (APS) to aniline monomers (AN). With the increase of APS/AN ratio from 0.5 to 4, the oxidation degree together with the QR content of PANI increases. Accordingly, the produced catalysts' morphology experiences an evolution from bulk, nanotube to flower-like structure. And the ORR activity shows volcano-relationship with the increase of the QR content in PANI precursors. Specifically, when APS/AN=2.5, the derived PANI with moderate QR content benefits to produce Fe-N-C catalyst which shows the maximum ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.74 V (vs RHE) in acidic electrolyte among the produced catalysts. Moreover, two opposite effects with the increasing QR content are revealed; i) the QR benefits the Fe coordination and Fe-Nx active sites formation which enhances the activity, and ii) the accompanying formed oligomers decrease the thermal stability and thus decrease the number of active sites.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			2365-6549			WOS:000476767700050

However, controllable synthesis of the nickel phosphide catalyst is still a challenge because of its complex phase transformations during the synthesis procedure. Deep understanding of the nanoparticle formation mechanism should be taken into account for an efficient catalyst tailoring of size, shape, structure, and eventually performance. Unfortunately, there are only few reports regarding their formation processes. In this regard, we investigated the formation process of Ni-P nanoparticles by a conjunction of in situ X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) from the Ni K-edge, ex situ XAFS from the P K-edge, in situ small angle X-ray scattering, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy techniques. A novel phase structure transformation was unraveled from views of evolutions of chemical valence, coordination structures, and size distributions along with the reaction time. The results demonstrated a four-stage formation mechanism of Ni-P nanoparticles: nucleation of crystalline Ni, nucleation of Ni-P, phase transformation from crystalline Ni to noncrystalline Ni-P, and growth of noncrystalline Ni-P nanoparticles. Furthermore, different growth manners were also observed at different growing stages. Our results shed light on efficient control of the phase structure, particle size, and compositions of nickel phosphide nanoparticles, which would enlighten and promote their further development.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			1932-7447			WOS:000439661000069

Therefore, people are keen to adopt various synthetic strategies to accurately assemble the target nanocrystals, and reveal the underlying mechanism of the formation of specific structures. In this work, the total reaction time is adjusted to let the prepared MnCo Prussian blue analogous (MnCoPBA) crystals show four evolving morphological changes at different stages with the assistance of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Furthermore, it is clearly observed that the epitaxial growth along the (100) plane on the shell of MnCoPBA nanocrystals is favored, and the thermodynamics and kinetics in the morphology change process are analyzed in detail. Through the simple pyrolysis, MnCoPBA crystals can be successfully converted into the corresponding carbon composites, of which Mn2Co2C nanoparticles are evenly distributed in highly graphitized carbon matrix. Among them, PBA-III-700 performs good oxygen reduction reaction performance in alkaline solution with the half-wave potential of 0.801 V and diffusion-limited current density of 5.36 mA cm(-2), and its zinc-air battery exhibits the peak power density of 103.4 mW cm(-2)competitive with commercial Pt/C.									24	0	0	0	2	0	24			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000574846700001	33015948

The strong affinity of vanadium with carbon and oxygen resulted in the significant difficulty to produce VN with a high purity. In this paper, a novel production route was proposed that involves the magnesiothermic reduction and nitration of vanadium (III) oxide (V2O3) in nitrogen atmosphere with the assistance of magnesium chloride (MgCl2) in the temperature range of 948 K to 1073 K (675 degrees C to 800 degrees C). Compared with the traditional methods, there was no contamination of carbon. Meanwhile, oxygen content can be controlled to a low level. Furthermore, VN could be prepared at low temperatures within a short time, which was beneficial for decreasing the particle size of VN. The phase transition and morphological evolution of samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy, respectively. The experimental results showed that high temperature assisted in decreasing the residual oxygen content in VN but can decrease the specific surface area. Oxygen content of the obtained VN powder after reacting at 1073 K (800 degrees C) for 3 hours was 1.36 wt pct.									4	2	0	0	0	0	5			1073-5615	1543-1916		WOS:000451647900054

Herein, for the first time, Fe doped vanadium phosphide functionalized porous carbon loading on nickel foam (FexVy-PC/NF) catalyst is designed from the bimetallic Fe/V metal-organic framework (FexVy-MOF) by a combination of solvothermal and phosphorization approach. Interestingly, it is noted that the foreign Fe is introduced to the vanadium phosphide crystal rather than forming two crystals. Thus, the morphology, electron state of vanadium, conductivity and facet exposure of vanadium phosphide are observed to be tuned through adjusting the ratio of Fe to V. Remarkably, the optimized electrocatalyst can deliver 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 66, 201 mV for HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH. As for the overall water splitting, it only needs a lower potential of 1.56 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) and displays desirable durability attributed to the electron interaction between Fe and V, the good conductivity, porous feature of mother MOF and the graphitic layer encasing the metal nanoparticles.

The optimized Pb(NiWMnNbZrTi)(1/6)O-3 ceramic is available on a kilogram-scale and displays commendable ORR activity in alkaline media with high selectivity over 91 % across the wide potential range for H2O2 including an outstanding degradation property for organic dyes through the Fenton process. The exceptional performance of this perovskite oxide is attributed to the entropy stabilization-induced polymorphic transformation assuring the robust structural stability, decreased charge mobility as well as synergistic catalytic effects which we confirm using advanced in situ Raman, transient photovoltage, Rietveld refinement as well as finite elemental analysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000772005400001	35238121

The S2- and Se2- ions are obtained after decomposition of sulfur and selenium precursors, which on reacting with oxidized Ni2+ ions, from the surface of pristine Ni-foam, produces NiS, and NiSSe superstructures. The crystal phase, surface morphology and chemical states of as-grown electrocatalysts are monitored through various measurment tools. Due to synergistic effects, the NiSSe nanostructured electrode provides a superior over potentials as low as 154 and 75 mV for OERs and HERs activity in electrochemical water splitting measurement. Moreover, the NiSSe electrode exhibits an excellent chemical stability compared to the NiS and NiSe electrodes during the electrolysis process. Such an outstanding catalytic performance makes the NiSSe electrode as a potential candidate in water splitting applications. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we report a monoatomic cobalt tailoring strategy to boost the performance of platinum clusters (ca. <1 nm) via hetero-charge-trapping chemistry by ultraviolet light reducing Pt-based anions anchored on target Co cations. The created Co1Ptx clusters exhibit a mass activity of 2.27 A mgPt-1, which is about 1621% higher than that obtained by state-of-the-art Pt/C (2 nm) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). This can be attributed to the butterfly effect of electron donor from monoatomic cobalt in the platinum clusters. Moreover, the improved stability results from the Co located at the bottom position of the Pt host, possessing high resistance to Co leaching. Therefore, this offers a general strategy to optimize the high performance of platinum group metal (PGM) clusters for electrocatalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000847682000001	35943902

Whereas wild-type P450-BM3 shows in the case of the parent compound poor enantioselectivity in slight favor of the (S)-sulfoxide (er = 75: 25), (S)-selectivity was enhanced to er = 93: 7, while reversal of enantioselectivity favoring the (R)-sulfoxide was also achieved (er = 7: 93). Two derivatives of the parent substrate underwent similar stereoselective sulfoxidation reactions. Sulfoxides of this type are of potential pharmaceutical interest. This biocatalytic approach nicely complements synthetic methods.									14	1	0	0	4	0	15			1615-4150	1615-4169		WOS:000403567500004

The heterojunction structure formed by BiVO4 and NiFeOOH broadens the light absorption range and accelerates the internal separation of photogenerated carriers, and then quickly captures holes to enter the Co-Pi layer. The holes are efficiently used for the water oxidation on the surface of the photoelectrode through a cyclic catalytic process in the Co-Pi layer. The BiVO4/NiFeOOH/Co-Pi core-shell structure can effectively increase the active surface area and accelerate the interface charge transfer. LSV exhibits excellent photocurrent density (2.03 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE) and lower onset potential (similar to 0.031 V vs. RHE) due to the efficient separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers. The results indicate that the photoelectrode is expected to be used in practical applications. Additionally, the efficiency of the hydrogen and oxygen evolution is improved greatly. This strategy is expected to be applied to other candidate photoanodes for PEC water splitting.									80	1	0	0	5	0	80			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000525637300039

Herein, we designed and synthesized a core- shell structure which is an ultrathin MoSe2 nanosheet coated CuS hollow nanoboxes (CuS@MoSe2) to form an open p-n junction structure. The space charge effect in the p-n junction region will greatly improve electron mass transfer and conduction, and also have abundant active interfaces. It was used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for water oxidation at a wide pH range. It exhibits a low overpotential of 49 mV for the HER and 236 mV for the OER at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) in acidic pH, 72 mV for the HER and 219 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) for the OER in alkaline pH, and 62 mV for the HER and 230 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) for the OER under neutral conditions. The experimental results and density functional theory calculations testify that the p-n junction in CuS@ MoSe(2 )designed and synthesized has a strong space charge region with a synergistic effect. The built-in field can boost the electron transport during the electrocatalytic process and can stabilize the charged active center of the p-n junction. This will be beneficial to improve the electrocatalytic performance.

Both monopolar and bipolar reactor with porous graphite electrodes were modelled, as a design aid for predicting spatial distributions of potentials, concentrations, current densities and efficiencies, as well as specific electrical energy consumptions and by-pass currents. Since the industrial effluent contains a large excess of supporting electrolyte (Na2SO4), the electrical migrational contribution to reactant transport rates was neglected and the current density-potential relationship was described by the Butler-Volmer equation, allowing for both kinetic and mass transport control. The models were implemented and the governing equations solved using commercial finite element software (FEMLAB). The effects were investigated of electrolyte velocity, applied cathode potential, dissolved oxygen concentration and inlet Pb(II) ion concentration on single-pass conversion, current efficiency and specific electrical energy consumptions. According to model predictions, de-oxygenation of the inlet process stream was found to be crucial to achieving acceptable (i.e. > 0.8) current efficiencies. Bipolar porous electrodes were also determined to be inappropriate for the recovery of Pb(II) from effluents, as the low concentration involved resulted in the predicted fraction of current lost as by-pass current, i.e. current not flowing in and out of the bipolar electrode, to be greater than 90% for the ranges of the variables studied.									17	1	0	0	0	1	18			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000234273900005

However, the kinetics of the reaction is slow and more efficient catalysts are required. In this work, we describe a facile way to fabricate amorphous nickel phosphides on graphene nanosheets (a-Ni2P/G), which shows high efficient performance for overall urea electrolysis. The a-Ni2P/G catalyst has abundant surface area for abundant catalytic active sites and high proportion of Ni3+ active sites, realizing a superior intrinsic activity for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Impressively, the a-Ni2P/G catalyst requires only much lower potentials of 1.28 V and - 0.1 V for UOR and HER at 10 mA cm(-2). The assembled a-Ni2P/G parallel to a-Ni2P/G electrolyzer needs a small cell voltage of 1.39 V to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This work highlights a promising pathway to develop a cost-efficient catalyst for energy-saving H-2 generation combined with waste water purification.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000681602800001

However, the practical application of ALBs is hindered by O-2-breathing and O-2 (electro)-chemistry issues in Earth's atmosphere. Recent investigations revealed that the oxygen permeable membranes (OPMs) and oxygen permeable cathodes (OPCs) could significantly improve the cycling life and energy efficiency of ALBs. Although great efforts have been made for the OPMs and OPCs, many scientific and technical challenges still need to be overcome to achieve ALBs that reach industrial standards. In addition, there is a degree of commonality in some of the challenges facing OPMs and OPCs, especially concerning O-2 transport. In this review, we summarize the recent process related to the challenges, preparation, and application of OPMs and OPCs in practical ALB systems. We first discuss the O-2-breathing issues of ALBs and then summarize the application of advanced OPMs, which are frequently invoked as a protective strategy to resist the invasion of undesired gas species (CO2, H2O, etc.) from external air. Specifically, the O-2 (electro)-chemistry issues involving the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER)/oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and tri-phase transfer channels for electrons, lithium ions, and oxygen gas on OPCs are equally important for ALBs. Following these insights, main challenges and perspectives are given in the end on how to design high-performance OPMs and OPCs for practically accessible ALBs in Earth's atmosphere.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2405-8297			WOS:000781812700004

Simple synthesis methods to make highly porous and active nanostructured catalytic materials with large electroactive surface areas are very important to implement water-to-fuel conversion schemes. Herein, ultrafine, transparent thin-film nickel-oxide (NiOx) nanoflakes are facilely synthesized following a simple spray-coating method from a solution-phase precursor. The NiOx nanoscale structures are grown on the FTO surface in the form of highly uniform smooth thin films. They are employed as promising bifunctional electrocatalysts for the overall water splitting process under alkaline conditions. During water oxidation catalysis, NiOx-SC/FTO initiates the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at an overpotential eta of just 250 mV while generating current decade at just 300 mV and demonstrates well-balanced kinetics toward OER. 10 mA cm(-2) current density remains persistent for many hours of continuous electrolysis at just 1.53 V-RHE illustrating high robustness of the system. The catalyst also showed substantial activity and durability toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under the same electrochemical conditions. Tafel slopes of just 57 and 89 mV dec(-1) for OER and HER in 0.5 M aqueous KOH solution, respectively, showing high intrinsic kinetics for electrocatalysis. Having high electrochemical surface area and an optimum number of electrochemically active sites, these transparent NiOx thin films can be advantageously combined with photoelectrochemical devices for light-driven water-to-fuel conversion systems.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2470-1343			WOS:000537145000002	32455182

Results indicate that the as-fabricated S-NiFe2O4@Ti3C2@NF hybrid electrode exhibits a superior OER activity, which includes only 1.50 V vs. RHE to afford a current density of 20 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 46.8 mV dec(-1) and excellent catalytic stability in 1 M KOH. Excellent OER performances are attributed to the favorable 3D hierarchical network structure and relatively fast electron transport provided by the few-layer Ti3C2 flakes matrix, good catalytic activity and abundant catalytic active sites from the ultra-small S-NiFe2O4 nanosheets, synergistically. This work could open a feasible way for achieving a new type of 3D MXenes based hierarchical network structure for renewable energy applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, ultrathin nitrogen-doped molybdenum carbide nanosheets (N-Mo2C NSs) is used as a versatile support to stabilize Ru single atoms (SAs) sites via the anti-Ostwald ripening. Ru SAs are dispersed into the N-Mo2C NSs matrix via the strong bonding between the Ru atoms and Mo2C NSs regulated by N doping. The atomic isolated Ru SAs are confirmed by spherical aberration correction transmission electron microscopy (AC HAADF-STEM) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements. Ru SAs/N-Mo2C NSs exhibits outstanding HER performance, with a small overpotential of 43 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), and robust catalytic stability in 1.0 M KOH. Importantly, Ru SAs/N-Mo2C NSs possesses a higher mass activity of 6.44 A/mg(Ru) than that of 20 wt% PVC (0.91 A/mg(Pt)) at the overpotential of 100 mV. Theoretical calculations further reveal that the high HER activity of Ru SAs/N-Mo2C NSs is derived from the synergistically accelerated the dissociation of H2O and the optimized H adsorption strength in Mo-Ru interface. This result provides a new direction for the rational designing monatomic electrocatalysts for HER via support interaction effect.									55	4	0	0	7	0	55			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000552015900061

This undertaking necessitates the need for rational design of electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability for electrochemical conversion. Significant progress has been made in this regard considering the importance of the products in these reaction systems. Hence, this review presents an update of both experimental and theoretical investigations that can offer insights into the design of high-performance electrocatalysts to facilitate the electrochemical conversion of H2O, N-2 and CO2 into value added products. We analyse the current status of available electrocatalysts based on a standard set of figures of merit, namely yield rate, faradaic efficiency, overpotential, current density and stability. Then, we constructively compare the different electrocatalysts based on their reaction mechanisms and operation performances by evaluating the catalyst construction, electrolyte utilization and device practicality. Finally, we provide challenges and prospects from the aspects of both theoretical and experimental insights as a general guide to offer potential future directions.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2633-5409		WOS:000739539900001

It is essential to find a better candidate for energy storage device possessing high ion adsorption and faster surface redox reactions that can lead to improved charge transfer and controlled ionic and electronic transport. Herein, a network of curly-edged CoFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets was grown on Ni foam via a one-pot hydrothermal synthesis route. We studied the stepwise morphological evolution and electrochemical performance of CoFe-LDH during variable hydrothermal reaction conditions. After 5000 charge-discharge cycles, the CoFe-LDH exhibited a maximum areal capacity of 2263 mC cm(-2) (at a scan rate of 5 mV s(-1)) and 1490 mC cm(-2) (at an applied current of 0.1 A) with capacity retention of 92.6%. We also fabricated and tested the electrochemical properties of a symmetric cell device using CoFe-LDH, demonstrating that the CoFe-LDH is a promising candidate as an electrode material in energy storage applications.

Results showed that the Mn2+ could obviously promote oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and thereby weaken oxidation efficiency of Mn2+ (eta(MnO2)) and dissolution of Pb2+. The significant improvement in kinetic parameters for OER was found in electrolytes of 1 and 3 g/L Mn2+, but became unstable as the Mn2+ concentration increased to 10 g/L. This result was correlated with much different properties of oxide layers that its changes of microstructure are involved in, since it confirmed that the positive role of compact oxide layers in contributing to high corrosion resistance and activity for OER, but excessive Mn2+, resulted in its micromorphology of overthickness and instability. Such differences resulted from the effect of the Mn2+ concentration fluctuation on kinetic rates of the nucleation growth process. The formation and adsorption of intermediate MnO2-OHads identified as the controlled step for Mn2+ catalyzing OER was also recommended. The generation mechanism of anode slime was found to be changed in essence due to varying Mn2+ concentrations. In electrolyte of 1 g/L Mn2+, results revealed that the root cause of excessive small suspended anode slime (around 20 mu m) was the change of the initial pathway of Mn2+ electro-oxidation, whereas, it showed great improvement in the settling performance as the Mn2+ concentration was increased to 10 g/L. Considering the potential of optimizing Mn2+ concentrations as a cleaner approach to control anode slime, deepening the understanding of the impact mechanism of Mn2+ can provide new insights into intervention in the generation of anode slime.									8	1	0	0	1	0	9			0944-1344	1614-7499		WOS:000431790000071	29450773

Herein, we report the in situ fabrication of pure cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) phase with highly porous structures during OER testing process, which exhibits outstanding performance for OER with a low overpotential of 245 mV at 10 mAcm(-2) and retain stable catalytic activity for 250 h with no appreciable decay. Experimental characterizations revealed that the superior catalytic activity of as-formed CoOOH phase mainly arises from the highly porous structures, which endows the electrocatalyst with high specific surface area (similar to 200m(2) g(-1)), numerous accessible channels and abundant active sites. Evidence has been produced showing that the in situ formed pure CoOOH is the active and stable phase in cobalt-based electrocatalysts for OER in alkaline medium. In addition, the synthetic strategy applied here could provide a novel way to fabricate nanoporous structures under mild conditions using electrochemical oxidation method. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A wide range of deposition conditions (T-dep=250-800 degrees C and P-total=0.1-500 Torr) was explored and the effects on the features of the films were investigated. Structural and morphological characteristics were found to be very sensitive to those conditions. By the use of appropriate conditions and reactive gas (H2 or 02), high-purity, dense and oriented films were obtained. On the other hand, films consisted of agglomerated nanocrystalline particles of pure metals or metal oxides were also possible to obtain. The size of nanoparticles varied from 15 to 100 nm depending on deposition conditions. The nanocrystalline nature of films was used for applications requiring large surface area such as electrocatalysts for electrochemical reactions of technological interest. Nanocrystalline platinum films prepared by MOCVD exhibited superior electrocatalitic activity than platinum electrocatalysts prepared by conventional methods in the hydrogen evolution reaction. In addition, iridiumruthenium oxide films showed to be very promising for the oxygen evolution reaction.					11th International Symposium on Metastable, Mechanically Alloyed and Nanocrystalline Materials11th International Symposium on Metastable, Mechanically Alloyed and Nanocrystalline Materials	AUG   22, 2004-AUG 26, 2005AUG   22, 2004-AUG 26, 2005	Japan Soc Promot Sci; Int Frontier Ctr Adv Mat; Tohoku Univ, Inst Mat Res; Sendai Tourism & Convent Bur; Aoba Kougaku Shinkoukai; Japan Sci & Technol Agcy; Minist Educ, Culture, Sports, Sci & Technol; Nanotechnol Res Network Ctr Japan; Tohoku Univ, 21st Century COE Program; Int Ctr Res & Educ Mat; Topy Ind Ltd; IMRA Mat R&D Co Ltd; NGK Insulators Ltd; Makabe R&D Co Ltd; Ishihara Sangyo Co Ltd; Japan Elect Mat Corp; Dynax Corp; Sony Corp Micro Syst Network So; Nissin Giken Co Ltd; Fukuda Met Foil & Powder Co Ltd; Hitachi Met Ltd; Res Soc Supercooled Liquid & Glassy MetJapan Soc Promot Sci; Int Frontier Ctr Adv Mat; Tohoku Univ, Inst Mat Res; Sendai Tourism & Convent Bur; Aoba Kougaku Shinkoukai; Japan Sci & Technol Agcy; Minist Educ, Culture, Sports, Sci & Technol; Nanotechnol Res Network Ctr Japan; Tohoku Univ, 21st Century COE Program; Int Ctr Res & Educ Mat; Topy Ind Ltd; IMRA Mat R&D Co Ltd; NGK Insulators Ltd; Makabe R&D Co Ltd; Ishihara Sangyo Co Ltd; Japan Elect Mat Corp; Dynax Corp; Sony Corp Micro Syst Network So; Nissin Giken Co Ltd; Fukuda Met Foil & Powder Co Ltd; Hitachi Met Ltd; Res Soc Supercooled Liquid & Glassy Met	Sendai, JAPANSendai, JAPAN	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1422-6375		0-87849-988-1	WOS:000233861200149

The experimental results indicated higher temperatures promoted the formation of NO, with conversions varied from 1.26-18.64% to 3.85-43% for fuel-rich and fuel-lean conditions respectively. As for N2 formation, conversion of pyridine to N-2 had a slight increase from 1073 to 1173 K then declined rapidly in oxidizing atmosphere, whereas this conversion stabilized at about 36% before decreasing to 29% above 1173 Kin the presence of insufficient O-2. Increasing the equivalence ratio led to a monotonic increase of NO in both O-2/Ar and O-2/CO2 atmospheres, and the gap between these atmospheres developed with a. The simulation results showed that the high CO2 concentration reduced the availability of oxygen thus altered the evolution of NO through promoting reaction HNO + M <-> H + NO + M and limiting reaction HNO + O-2 <-> HO2 + NO. This was even more important at higher temperatures. Besides, the major pathways for NO consumption were taken through reaction with NCO and NH as intermediates. In general, the model of Terasa09 described the experimental trends well, and this combustion kinetic was applicable to oxy-fuel conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Cobalt has often been incorporated into chalcogenides to form bifunctional electrocatalysts due to its abundance, catalytic activity, and environmentally friendly nature. Nanostructured tellurium is an emerging electrocatalyst support that can accelerate electron transportation while serving as a host to many active sites. This study focuses on exploring the effects of using different and low amounts of cobalt-incorporated tellurium nanostructured composites (CoTe2/Te) as electrocatalysts in hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) with 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The electrocatalysts were prepared via a facile hydrothermal route. The highest HER activity was revealed for the CoTe2/Te (Co:Te = 4:20) composite electrode, achieving overpotentials of 312 and 421 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, with a Tafel slope of 69.2 mV dec(-1). The optimal CoTe2/Te (Co:Te = 4:20) electrode retains an analogous polarization curve with almost zero attenuation of the cathodic current after 2000 cyclic voltammetry curves (CVs). The electrode remained highly active even after constant current density was maintained in the stability testing over 20 h. The HER performance of the CoTe2/Te (Co:Te = 4:20) electrode was observed to be superior to those of Te (commercial powder), Te (fabricated), and CoTe2 electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000783789100001

In this work, we report the synthesis of ultrafine Fe-doped Ni12P5 nanoparticles anchored on cotton-derived P-doped porous carbon ((FexNiy)(12)P-5@PPC) by a facile impregnation-pyrolysis process. The results demonstrated that the Fe doping amount in Ni12P5 plays an important role in regulating the OER activity of electrocatalysts. As a result, the obtained (Fe0.25Ni0.75)(12)P-5@PPC with a large surface area of 847.2 m(2) g(-1) and an average nanoparticle size of similar to 8.5 nm exhibited superior OER activity, achieving extremely low overpotentials of 131 and 198 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, respectively. The comprehensive investigations revealed that low-crystallized NiFe2O4 with high-spin Fe species in situ transformed from Fe-doped Ni12P5 during electrocatalysis is responsible for the high OER activity. The findings in this work would be helpful for rational design and development of inexpensive and robust OER electrocatalysts for applications in renewable energy technologies.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000639579200001

The 3D electrode with large accessible active sites and improved conductivity, possesses an optimized ionic and electronic transport path during electrochemical processes. High areal capacitance of 1.65 F cm-2 is obtained at an ultrahigh current density of 100 mA cm-2, which is 19.88 times higher than pristine NF. The direct growth of nanowires makes the present supercapacitor electrode robust for long-term cycling test. By virtue of the favorable hydrogen adsorption energies on Ni0 and OHads energy on NiO or NiOOH, the 3D electrode exhibits high performance in hydrogen evolution reaction with 146 mV at eta10 mA cm-2 and Tafel value of 72 mV dec-1, and oxygen evolution reaction with 382 mV at eta10 mA cm-2 and Tafel value of 103 mV dec-1 in 1 m KOH. An electrolyzer using 3D electrodes as both anode and cathode can yield a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at 1.71 V, and possesses superior long-term stability to an electrolyzer consisting of Pt/C||Ir/C. The present work develops an effective and low-cost method for the large-scale fabrication of Ni/NiO core-shell nanowires on commercial NF, providing a promising candidate for supercapacitors, fuel cells, and electrocatalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810			INSPEC:18406022

The mild reaction conditions yield smaller primary particle sizes and larger specific surface areas than the conventional solid state reaction. The photocatalytic properties are determined using both photocatalytic terephthalic acid hydroxylation and photocatalytic hydrogen generation. All of the materials described herein generate hydrogen without the addition of a co-catalyst. Due to the initially agglomerated but porous morphology of the sol-gel-derived CsTaWO6, tribochemical treatment via short term ball milling has a strong effect on the photocatalytic activities of these materials. Ball milling increases the surface area of the materials, leading to strongly improved activity for the generation of ? OH radicals, but also generates surface defects in the materials. The defective sites act as electron traps, which depress the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. However, by combining ball milling and photodeposition of Rh, highly improved hydrogen generation rates for CsTaWO6 are achieved. The sol-gel citrate route finally leads to more active materials than the solid state reaction.									27	1	0	0	2	0	27				2046-2069		WOS:000325408300029

These results were used for the kinetic analysis of the CIER mechanism. It was verified that only in a limited range of pH the CIER is the main electrode reaction. In this domain, a linear dependence between Rp and the protons activity was observed, which was explained on the basis of a surface model taking into account the inhibition of active sites by protons. This model allows obtaining an intrinsic polarization resistance (Rp(o)). On the basis of a complete theoretical kinetic analysis, the expressions of Rp(o) as a function of the chloride ion activity and the partial pressure of chlorine were obtained for each one of the mechanisms under discussion at present. The appropriate description of the experimental results was achieved through a modification of the Volmer-Krishtalik mechanism, giving strong evidence that the CIER takes place through this mechanism on the RuO2 electrodes.

It releases Ca-2+ and Cl- together with the extrinsic polypeptide of 17 kDa associated with the oxygen evolving complex of photosystem II. In this work we used thermoluminescence to study S(2/3)Q(B)(-) and S(2)Q(A)(-) charge recombination. It is shown that RR produced a deeper inhibition of oxygen evolution compared with the effect of extrinsic polypeptide or Ca2+/Cl- depletion. Even though Mn is not released, the Mn cluster is disorganized by RR and the S-1 -> S-2 transition is inhibited.

The coatings were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electronic spectroscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and so on. Results show that continuous rutile TiO2 coatings decorated with discrete SnO2 particles were formed during thermal oxidation at the temperature range of 873-1073 K. Through the temperature range, a small quantity of SnO was formed. However, tiny amount of Ti2O3 was formed only when oxidation temperature was 1073 K. The surface topography evolution of rutile TiO2 crystals during the thermal oxidation and relevant mechanism was also examined. Equiaxed, rod, columnar and needle TiO2 crystals with nanoscale were formed at temperatures from 873-1073 K. The topography evolution indicates that the diffusion of oxygen species into the formed rutile TiO2 layer was predominant at 873 K. It favored the growth of equiaxed crystals in the tangent plane rather than radial direction of Al(2)O3 ball substrate at the early stage of the thermal oxidation. However, the diffusion of Ti cations became prevailing compared with oxygen species at 1073 K. The reaction of Ti and oxygen species occurred at the external surface of the formed TiO2 layer where rutile TiO2 needles were formed. During thermal oxidation at 973 K, both the Ti cations and oxygen species were involved in the diffusion process and clusters of paired/parallel rutile TiO2 nanorods were formed. The addition of metallic Sn remarkably affected the surface topography and the grain size of rutile TiO2 crystals through regulating the diffusion of Ti cations and changing the local oxygen concentration surrounding Ti coatings. A proper additive amount refined the grains of rutile TiO2. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			0257-8972			WOS:000389687600036

Reported synthetic approaches for branched alloy nanostructures are, however, limited by the synthesis using a seed-growth process. Here, we demonstrate a conveniently fast and one-pot solution-phase thermal reduction strategy yielding nanoalloys of Pt with various solute feed ratios, exhibiting hyperbranched morphologies and good dispersity. When Pt was alloyed with transition metals (Ni, Co, Fe), we observed well-defined dendritic nanostructures in PtNi, PtCo and Pt(NiCo), but not in PtFe, Pt(FeNi) or Pt(FeCo) due to the steric hindrance of the trivalent Fe(acac)(3) precursor used during synthesis. In the case of Pt-based nanoalloys containing Ni and Co, the dendritic morphological evolution observed was insensitive to large variations in solute concentration. The functionality of these nanoalloys towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR); however, was observed to be dependent on the composition, increasing with increasing solute content. Pt-3(NiCo)(2) exhibited superior catalytic activity, affording about a five-and 10-fold enhancement in area-specific and mass-specific catalytic activities, respectively, compared to the standard Pt/C nanocatalyst. This solution-based synthetic route offers a new approach for constructing dendritic Pt-based nanostructures with excellent product yield, monodispersity and high crystallinity.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			2079-4991			WOS:000442523100013	29949875

So, rationally designed non-noble metal based-electrocatalysts with high activity and durability can lead to high performance water electrolyzer systems and high purity hydrogen generation. Herein, a facile two-step method: hydrothermal and electrodeposition, respectively, are developed to decorate highly porous three-dimensional binder-free structure NiFeO/NiO nanosheets array on Ni foam (NiFeO/NiO/NF) with robust adhesion as a high-performance electrode for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER). The electrodeposition process applied after the initial hydrothermal process provides a stable structure and, in addition, enhances the sluggish hydrogen evolution efficiency. In alkaline media, the developed electrode needs an overpotential of 48 and 188 mV to drive current densities (j) of 10 and 100 mA cm-2, respectively. After continuous 110 h electro-chemical stability test under j = 150 mA cm-2 conditions, demonstrates an excellent sta-bility with ignorable activity decrease. Such superior HER catalytic performance can be derived from the synergistic effect between Ni and Fe atoms, also exposure to a high number of active sites on the nanosheets, and good dynamic with effective electron transport along the nanosheets. The present work provides a promising route for the design and fabrication of cost-effective and highly efficient HER electrocatalysts.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The similarity of the [O/Mg] trend in these markedly different populations suggests that the strong decline is due to a metallicity-dependent modulation of the stellar yields from massive stars by mass loss from winds, related to the Wolf-Rayet phenomenon, as proposed by McWilliam & Rich in 2004. We have modified existing models for the chemical evolution of the Galactic bulge and the solar neighborhood with the inclusion of metallicity-dependent oxygen yields from theoretical predictions for massive stars that include mass loss by stellar winds. Our results significantly improve the agreement between predicted and observed [O/Mg] ratios in the bulge and disk above solar metallicity; however, a small zero-point normalization problem remains to be resolved. The zero-point shift indicates that either the semi-empirical yields of Francois et al. obtained in 2004 need adjustment, or that the bulge initial mass function ( IMF) is not quite as flat as found by Ballero et al. in 2007. Our result removes a previous inconsistency between the interpretation of [O/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] ratios in the bulge, and confirms the conclusion that the bulge formed more rapidly than the disk, based on the overabundances of elements produced by massive stars. We also provide an explanation for the long-standing difference between [alpha/Fe] and [O/Fe] trends among disk stars more metal rich than the Sun.									54	0	0	0	0	0	54			0004-6256	1538-3881		WOS:000257290200031

In addition, cobalt is a promising metal ion for many electrocatalytic applications, including HER. Herein, we report the electrocatalytic activity of a cobalt(II) compound based on thicalix[4]arene that was characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The CV using the glassy carbon as a working electrode versus Ag/AgCl, show two reduction peaks at -0.582 V and -1.270 V for the two redox couples Co2+/Co+ and Co+/Co, respectively. The two-electron proton reduction into hydrogen in the presence of the catalyst and 5 equivalents (12.5 mM) of acetic acid show a noticeable shift of about 780 mV compared to the catalyst-free reaction and 200 mV compared to the second wave observed for the acid-free solution. Moreover, a maximum anodic peak current of 32 mu A was observed upon adding 30 equivalents (75 mM) of acetic acid.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1452-3981			WOS:000814066800006

In this work, cobalt phosphide hybrid nanosheets supported on carbon felt (CoP HNS/CF) are presented, which exhibit the superior electrocatalytic hydrogen production under a universal-pH. In these nanosheets, a single CoP HNS is composed of polycrystalline CoP and oxygen-enriched amorphous Co-O-P phase. Benefiting from its unique nanoarchitecture, as-fabricated CoP HNS/CF exhibits a tremendous electrocatalytic HER activity and outperforms Pt/C as well as state-of-the-art CoP electrocatalysts in universal-pH. In acidic and neutral media, the CoP HNS/CF shows superior electrocatalytic activity while maintaining its original hybrid crystalline-amorphous phase and morphology. In alkaline medium, the unexpected phase and morphological reorganization of CoP HNS/CF results in outstanding electrocatalytic operation. CoP HNS/CF not only achieves high electrocatalytic activity and kinetics, but also a stable and long operating lifetime even under a high current density of 500 mA.cm(-2). Furthermore, the fabrication of CoP HNS/CF can be scaled up easily, and the large CoP HNS/CF electrode also exhibits similar electrocatalytic activity and stability.									34	2	0	0	1	0	34			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000543301300003

Researchers are studying different catalysts to obtain clean energy from renewable energy sources. Highly competent and potential catalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are required for commercialisation. Transition-metal diselenides are promising electrocatalysts for OER. Combining both experimental and theoretical results, we demonstrate that both Fe incorporation and Se vacancy engineering in the catalyst NiSe2 improve the electrocatalytic activity toward OER. Fe-doped NiSe2 with Se vacancies (V-Se-Ni0.70Fe0.30Se2) shows enhanced OER activity and requires an overpotential of 210 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This value is much lower than that of the benchmark catalyst IrO2/C. The results of density functional theory calculations show that both Fe doping and Se vacancies increase the density of states near the Fermi level, increasing the conductivity of the V-Se-Ni0.70Fe0.30Se2 catalyst. The calculations also reveal a decrease in the free energy of the reaction intermediates, resulting in enhanced electrocatalytic OER activity.									22	1	0	0	0	0	22			2398-4902			WOS:000539290400044

Through doping a small amount of Rh within the Co2Fe-P structure, the catalytic activities of the composite for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) could be highly improved, and an excellent electrochemical bifunctional catalyst could be achieved. Under acidic reaction conditions, it only required an overpotential of 76 mV for HER to achieve a current density of 10 mA.m(-2). Meanwhile, excellent electrochemical performance could also be obtained in alkaline elec-trolytes. The overpotential was 48 mV for HER and 303 mV for OER at 10 mA.m(-2) in 1 M KOH, respectively. Impressively, as a bifunctional electrode, the Rh doped Co2Fe-P composite can release a current density of 10 mA.m(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.54 V in 1 M KOH for overall water splitting, which could be compared with that using commercial noble metal catalysts.

We report electrochemical, in situ electrical, photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction measurements on Ni1-xFex(OH)(2)/Ni1-xFexOOH thin films to investigate the changes in electronic properties, OER activity, and structure as a result of Fe inclusion. We developed a simple method for purification of KOH electrolyte that uses precipitated bulk Ni(OH)(2) to absorb Fe impurities. Cyclic voltammetry on rigorously Fe-free Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH reveals new Ni redox features and no significant OER current until >400 mV overpotential, different from previous reports which were likely affected by Fe impurities. We show through controlled crystallization that beta-NiOOH is less active for OER than the disordered gamma-NiOOH starting material and that previous reports of increased activity for beta-NiOOH are due to incorporation of Fe-impurities during the crystallization process. Through-film in situ conductivity measurements show a >30-fold increase in film conductivity with Fe addition, but this change in conductivity is not sufficient to explain the observed changes in activity. Measurements of activity as a function of film thickness on Au and glassy carbon substrates are consistent with the hypothesis that Fe exerts a partial-charge-transfer activation effect on Ni, similar to that observed for noble-metal electrode surfaces. These results have significant implications for the design and study of Ni1-xFexOOH OER electrocatalysts, which are the fastest measured OER catalysts under basic conditions.									2057	97	0	0	125	0	2076			0002-7863			WOS:000335720200035	24779732

Inorganic component evolution								INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH				43	24			7762	7767		10.1021/ie0400494				NOV 24 2004	2004	The main goal of this work is to determine the mineral matter evolution of rubber when old tire is recycled in energy generation. For that, the combustion of a nonspecific mixture of waste rubber tire in an atmospheric fluidized bed reactor is studied in this work. Three different temperatures (750, 800, and 850degreesC) were tested using constant oxygen excess percentage (5%) and gas speed (0.24 m/s). It was observed that combustion efficiency depends on the temperature, but in general, low values are achieved mainly because the oxidation of the carbon black included in rubber tire is a slow gas-solid reaction. Important slag formation was observed after several hours of running the laboratory pilot plant. Big ash particles were generated inside the fluidized bed with particle sizes ranging between 1 and 10 mm. This slag formation caused important operational problems. Transformations of Zn and other inorganic elements are studied by using X-ray diffraction, indicating that the original zincite present in the rubber tire reacts with the silicate phases and is transformed into willemite and hardystonite. However, this reaction is not instantaneous and requires long reaction times.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0888-5885			WOS:000225323800011

Herein, it is reported that the simultaneous modulation of the mesoscale diffusion and Mo-Fe-C sites formation over monodispersed hollow Fe@MoS2-C sub-micro reactors for boosted OER performance. According to finite element simulation and analysis, the hollow nanostructured MoS2-C host possesses better mesoscale diffusion properties than its solid and yolk-shell counterparts. Notably, the sulfur vacancies and intercalated carbon in the sub-micro reactor offer a unique microenvironment for Fe anchoring on Mo-Fe-C sites. The stability and activity of the sites are revealed by theoretical calculations. The resultant Fe@MoS2-C presents an OER overpotential of 194 mV, which is much better than those of the Fe-based single-atom catalysts reported in the data. This monodispersed sub-micro reactor involves the modulation of mesoscale diffusion and single-atom sites, and it may have broad prospects for complex electrocatalytic reactions.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000783168500001

The nanoheterojunction photoanode exhibits an improved solar light-harvesting performance. The type-II analogous band alignment occurs because of p-n junction formation between p-ZnCo2O4 and n-ZnO nanorods (NRs), which accelerates the charge separation and transfer, significantly reducing the photogenerated electron-hole pair recombination. The ZnCo2O4 surface overlayer also passivates the surface states in ZnO, resulting in a remarkable reduction in photocarrier recombination. Additionally, the p-ZnCo2O4 shell layer acts as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst to influence the PEC reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface, boosting the charge transfer process and water oxidation reaction kinetics. Overall, an innovative nanoheterojunction photoanode is constructed to improve the PEC water oxidation of ZnO NRs by incorporating p-ZnCo2O4, which acts both as an OER catalyst and a p-type light-harvesting semiconductor.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2574-0962			WOS:000711236300120

All these devices are related to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and/or oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Currently, platinum group metals (PGMs) or their oxides are the most active electrocatalysts for OER and ORR. However, the high cost and scarcity of these noble metals hinder their widespread application. Therefore, the development of a low-cost electrocatalyst that exhibits catalytic performance comparable to or better than that of PGMs is essential.Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a new class of porous materials constructed from metal ions and organic linkers. MOF materials have diverse metal centers. In addition, organic ligands containing various heteroatoms can change the microenvironment of these metal centers. Moreover, the size, morphology, and porosity of MOF materials can be precisely tuned. These advantages of MOF are beneficial for electrocatalytic reactions. However, MOF is generally considered to be a poor electrocatalyst and is rarely used in the field of electrocatalysis because of its low electrical conductivity. To increase the electrical conductivity of MOF, high-temperature calcination or hybridization with conductive supports is necessary. However, high-temperature calcination may sacrifice the intrinsic molecular metal active sites of MOFs, whereas hybridization with conductive supports may block their inherent micropores. The development of MOF materials with high electrical conductivity is vital for electrocatalysis.Herein, we report a two-dimensional conductive MOF based on copper foam growth (Cu3HITP2/CF, where HITP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaaminotriphenylene hexahydrochloride, CF = copper foam), which has high electrical conductivity and excellent catalytic stability and can be used as a bi-functional electrocatalyst in OER and ORR. In addition, this catalyst does not require heat treatment or the addition of a conductive agent. We first electroplated needle-shaped Cu(OH)(2) nanowires onto the surface of a blank copper foam, and then immersed it in a solution of HITP to convert it into Cu3HITP2 at 65 degrees C. To confirm its physicochemical properties, the as-synthesized Cu3HITP2/CF was characterized and analyzed by X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The morphology was characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The as-synthesized Cu3HITP2/CF maintained a two-dimensional needle-like morphology during the reaction and could be stably operated in an alkaline solution. The overpotential at 10 mA.cm(-2) in the OER was only 1.53 V, and the current density did not decrease significantly after 24 h. The Faraday efficiency was as high as 96.84%, and only 1.57% of the by-product H2O2 was produced. In addition, during the ORR, the half-wave potential of Cu3HITP2/CF reached 0.75 V and its activity did not decrease significantly after 2000 cycles of voltammetric scanning. Moreover, its electron transfer number was 3.85, with 5.7% H2O2 generation. Comparative experiments with powder Cu3HITP2 showed that Cu3HITP2 grown on copper foam had a larger electrochemical specific surface area and exhibited superior OER and ORR properties, which was due to its two-dimensional needle-like morphology. In general, this study not only provides a method for in-situ growth of MOF materials on copper foam but also provides new ideas for developing two-dimensional conductive MOF materials in the field of electrocatalysis.									15	7	0	0	0	0	15			1000-6818			WOS:000489307000021

DSC, FTIR, X-ray diffraction, EPR and elemental analysis were used to study the evolution of chemical structures in these pre-carbonized fibers. At the same time, the reaction mechanism during the pre-carbonization was also explored. According to the chemical structural changes, the process of pre-carbonization below 600 degrees C can be divided into three stages. Below 450 degrees C, cross-linking and aromatization are the main reactions accompanied by heat liberation and rearrangement of oxygen-containing groups. But around 500 degrees C the pyrolysis reactions acquire the priority and the aromatization structure is dominant in the fibers. Until 600 degrees C the ladder polymers cross-link to form the carbon basal planes, resulting in the growth of aromatization structures. Based on the dependence of fiber structure on temperature, the pre-carbonization technology was optimized. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on time evolution analyses by reaction kinetics models, it was found that the oxidation at 860K, 895K and 945K has progressed with the Langmuir adsorption type, whereas the oxidation at 1000k has showed the character of the two-dimensional island growth involving SiO desorption. The oxidation rates increased with increasing surface temperature in the passive oxidation condition. The time evolution of each Si oxidation state (Sin+: n = 1, 2, 3, 4) derived from the Si-2p core-level shifts has also been analyzed. The results revealed that the thermal energy contributed to the migration process of the adsorbed oxygen and the emission of the bulk silicon atoms. Thus, the fraction of the Si4+ bonding state, i.e. SiO2 structure, was increased.					15th International Microprocesses and Nanotechnology Conference15th International Microprocesses and Nanotechnology Conference	NOV 06-08, 2002NOV 06-08, 2002	Japan Soc Appl Phys; IEEE Electron Device SocJapan Soc Appl Phys; IEEE Electron Device Soc	TOKYO, JAPANTOKYO, JAPAN	6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0021-4922			WOS:000184373400050

The formation of NO may have been a critical defence mechanism for primitive microrganisms at a time when life faced the problem of rising atmospheric levels of ozone (O-3) formed upon photolysis of oxygen (O-2), which occurred shortly after the development of respiration in cyanobacteria. The production of NO by organisms would have allowed neutralization of toxic O-3 by chemical reaction outside the cell, thus acting as a protective mechanism against oxidative destruction, allowing evolutionary advantage. Later, NO production might have allowed the control of reactive O-2 species within cells before the development of specific electron-accepting enzymes. The pathway of NO formation was then consequently developed further to serve other useful functions. Although mammalian cells produce NO from L-arginine, the origin of this ability might have arisen from the essential process of either nitrification or denitrification in prokaryotic cells.									85	3	0	0	73	0	88			0169-5347	1872-8383		WOS:A1995TF92500017	21237124

The H2O2 evolution rate is about 1002 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), much higher than that of most known photocatalysts. Pristine UiO-66 displays a much lower activity (314 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) under the same conditions, suggesting the significant role of boron. Both theoretical calculations and the combined experimental results verify the above conclusion, and the role of boron is ascribed to the following aspects: (1) enhanced O-2 adsorption, (2) highly selective proton-coupled two-electron transfer, (3) faster carrier separation and surface charge transfer, and (4) faster generation but slower decomposition rates of H2O2. This work highlights key factors in the two-electron O-2 reduction reaction (ORR), presents a deeper understanding of the role of boron in enhancing H2O2 production, and provides a new strategy for designing photocatalysts with excellent H2O2 evolution efficiency.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2051-6347	2051-6355		WOS:000698206000001	34486637	
J	Zheng, Chuanbao; Su, Mingze; Zhao, Haibo								Identifying the contribution of rich-CO2/H2O gasification on the char conversion in typical atmospheres of chemical looping with oxygen uncoupling via single particle simulation								COMBUSTION AND FLAME				229						111397	10.1016/j.combustflame.2021.111397		MAR 2021		JUL 2021	2021	Char conversion is an important but also complicated step during the combustion of solid fuels (i.e. coal and biomass) in chemical looping with oxygen uncoupling (CLOU). Potentially, both the lean-O-2 oxidation and rich-CO2/H2O gasification reactions of char contribute to the char conversion. However, the contribution degree of char gasification reaction has rarely been quantified in typical CLOU atmosphere. In this work, the single particle simulation is conducted to theoretically understand the effects of different operation conditions on the char conversion, and to identify the contribution degree of rich-CO2/H2O gasification in CLOU. A 10-step heterogeneous reaction mechanism is used for the gas-char reactions, and the random pore model is adopted to account for the evolution of porous char structure as well as its impact on reaction rates. The detailed conversion processes of chars with different sizes are simulated in various concentrations of gasification/oxidation agents and at different temperatures. The amounts of char consumed by lean-O-2 combustion, rich-CO2 gasification, and rich-H2O gasification are assumed to be proportional to the amounts of surface adsorbed species generated by char reacting with O-2, CO2, and H2O, and a formula to quantitatively calculate the relative contributions of the gasification reactions (both with CO2 and steam) is finally proposed. The results indicate that the gasification reactions (occurring in the inner core of the char particle) hardly influence the oxidation reaction (dominating the heterogeneous reaction in the external layer of the char particle) under CLOU conditions. The CO2-char gasification contributes less than 3% on the char conversion, while the contribution of H2O-char gasification can even reach 2-18%. The char-H2O gasification contributes more significantly (18% for 0.5 vol.% O-2, and 2% for 4 vol.% O-2) under the O-2-deficient conditions. Generally, the overall contribution of gasification reactions on the char conversion is between 1 and 20% in CLOU, which depends on the reaction temperature, gas composition, and char particle size.

Here, a new solid organic electrocatalyst, dilithium quinone-1,4-dicarboxylate (Li2C8H2O6) is presented, which is expected to overcome the shortcomings of inorganic catalysts. The function-oriented synthesis is low cost and low polluting. The electrocatalytic performance is evaluated by following the degradation of Li2O2 during the charge process in a Li-O-2 cell through insitu XRD and operando synchrotron radiation powder XRD (SR-PXD) measurements. The results indicate that the electrocatalytic activity of Li2C8H2O6 is similar to that of commercial Pt. The Li2O2 decomposition in a cell with Li2C8H2O6 catalyst follows a pseudo-zero-order reaction, virtually without any side reactions. These results provide an insight into the development of new organic catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in Li-O-2 batteries.									13	1	0	0	1	0	13			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000357619000006	26073442

The free energy and frequency calculations show that all the boron nitride flakes are stable before/after modification and metal adsorption. Edge modification significantly enhances the stability and interactivity of the flake. For instance, the free energy of binding decreases from -6.5 eV in the hydrogenated flake to -7.1 eV in the pristine one and the dipole moment increases from 4.5 D to 53.7 D, respectively. A wide spectrum of band gaps can also be achieved, where the band gap can be smoothly varied from similar to 6 eV in edge fluorinated flakes to 0.2 in sulfurated ones. Six hydrated metals, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, and Zn, are considered for adsorption by the flakes. The transition metals are highly selected by the flakes while heavy metals are weakly adsorbed. All hydrated metals are physically adsorbed by the edge and surface of hydrogenated flakes except Cu, which is chemically adsorbed. Chemical groups or elements attached to the flake strongly enhance the adsorption strength; the adsorption energy of hydrated Cr on the surface increases from 0.6 eV to 8.6 eV after attaching two COOH groups to the surface. Hydrogen evolution has also been observed through the adsorption process. The calculated low overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction (0.52 V) and hydrogen adsorption strength (0.11 eV) for the hydrogen evolution reaction indicate that boron nitride quantum dots are not only potential candidates for the removal of different metals from wastewater but also for efficient water splitting.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000510729400075	31942882

Herein, taking core-shell structure as an example, we propose a "phase mediation" strategy to boost electronic synergism on hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER). Through precisely tuning the cobalt cores from face-centered-cubic (fcc) to hexagonal (hcp) structure, the electrocatalytic overpotentials of Co@NC for both HER and OER are reduced by similar to 100 mV, and lower than those of most other carbon-based electrocatalysts yet reported. Operando SR-FTIR measurements uncover key intermediates of *H and *O-O bonding to N and C sites of C-N moieties in hcp-Co@NC during the HER and OER processes, respectively, suggesting the adjacent C-N moieties as synergistic active sites. In addition, atomic-level characterizations combined with theoretical calculations reveal robust interfacial metal-ligand coordination and electron injection effect within hcp-Co@NC. This promotes the delocalization of electronic structure of the NC shell, greatly accelerating overall water splitting.									23	0	0	0	3	0	23			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000517665200012

Deployment of electrolysis for H2 production is now closer to reality than ever before. Yet, several challenges associated with production cost, infrastructure, safety, storage, and so forth remain to be addressed. One of the overriding challenges is the production cost caused by a platinum electrode. To overcome such limitations, developing low-cost and stable electrocatalysts very close to the same electrode activity as platinum (Pt) metal is crucial to solving the efficiency issue in the process. Therefore, this review is in the direction of designing binary and ternary alloys of transition metal-based electrocatalysts anchored on carbon and focuses more on routes to enhance the performance of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The strategic routes to reduce overpotential and enhance electrocatalysts performance are discussed thoroughly in the light of HER mechanism and its derived descriptor.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1847-9286			WOS:000841406000001

Although MoS2 is a promising two dimensional (2D) electrocatalyst, the curved nanoplates adversely affect the delivery of H-2 during the HER. Herein, kinetically oriented MoS2 nanoflakes are prepared vertically on Mo2N nanoneedles anchored on flexible carbon cloth (MoS2-Mo2N/CC). The three-dimensional (3D) skeleton composed of carbon cloth (CC) and Mo2N prevents collapse of MoS2 during fabrication and electrochemical reactions. Moreover, the strong electronic interactions between MoS2 and Mo2N enhance charge transfer, moderate the hydrogen binding energy, and decrease the reaction energy thermodynamically. MoS2-Mo2N/CC delivers moderate hydrogen binding energy and fast H-2 desorption further enhancing the HER activity. Owing to the optimized hybrid structure, MoS2-Mo2N/CC exhibits a small overpotential of 121 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope of 49.6 mV dec(-1), and outstanding stability of 97.4% at 50 mA cm(-2). The results reveal the large potential of vertically oriented HER catalysts in energy storage and conversion.									21	3	0	0	0	0	22			2398-4902			WOS:000534220100007

Herein, Te-doped CoMoO3 supported on a carbon matrix (Te-CoMoO3@C) is synthesized by lattice engineering with filter paper as a sacrificial carrier and carbon source. The doping of Te can effectively modulate the local electronic structures of Co and Mo sites and significantly boost the electrochemical active surface area and electron transfer, which optimize the reactivity of reaction intermediates with the electrocatalysts. Moreover, the filter paper-derived carbon as a carrier guarantees adequate exposure of the surface active sites and enhances catalytic stability. Impressively, the optimized Te-CoMoO3@C only requires overpotentials of 76 and 215 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. As expected, Te-CoMoO3@C exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for water splitting. This work gives new insights into the rational design of metal oxides and opens up a novel strategy toward preparing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2052-1553			WOS:000813198300001

However, stimulating lattice oxygen activity may inevitably yield adverse effects, such as detrimental structure distortion and irreversible voltage decay. Herein, a low-cost Co/Ni free layered P2-type Na0.67Mn0.6Cu0.3Mg0.1O2 cathode is designed to construct reversible anion reduction. Na0.67Mn0.6Cu0.3Mg0.1O2 exhibits an obvious anion reduction electrochemical behavior, confirming that oxygen occurred redox reactions and participated in the capacity compensation process. The density functional theory calculation proves that the presence of the covalency be-tween Cu and O and the lager electron delocalization areas increase the anions redox activity. Furthermore, this compound provides an excellent cyclic stability and high capacity retention of 86 % at 0.2C rate after 100 cycles. In-situ Raman and ex-situ X-ray diffraction absorption spectroscopy reveal the reversible structure evolution and robust P2-type structure. The interaction between Cu and Mg plays a positive role in building the reversible anion reduction in terms of constructing electronic structure and regulating charge balance. Therefore, the Na0.67(Mn-Cu-Mg)O2 system provides an insight into designing a highly stable cathode material with anion reduction for sodium ion batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000863333400004

The kinetic model at the steady-state of ethylene oxychlorination was obtained by combining transient experiments of the two half-reactions in the redox cycle, namely CuCl2 reduced to Cud by ethylene and Cud oxidation by oxygen on the K-promoted CuCl2/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst. The dynamic transitions between CuCl2 and Cud of the active sites during the reactions are also modeled, and the contributions of two active sites, namely Cu coordination numbers of 4 and 3 in CuCl2 were distinguished and included in the kinetic model. The kinetic models describe well the transient response of the reduction and oxidation steps as well as the reaction at the steady-state at different reaction conditions. Moreover, by combining the reactor modeling through a steady-state approach, the spatial-time resolved CuCl2 profile and the C2H4 reaction rate can be well predicted in comparison with the experimental results.

A promising way forward is to harness the energy of intermittent renewable sources, such as solar and wind, to perform (electro)catalytic reactions to generate fuels, thus storing energy in the form of chemical bonds. However, current catalysts rely on the use of expensive, rare, or geographically localized elements, such as platinum. Widespread adoption of new (electro)catalytic technologies hinges on the discovery and development of materials containing earth-abundant elements, which can efficiently catalyze an array of (electro)chemical reactions.In the context of catalysis, descriptors provide correlations between fundamental physical properties, such as the electronic structure, and the resulting catalytic activity. The use of easily accessible descriptors has proven to be a powerful method to advance and accelerate discovery and design of new catalyst materials. The position of the oxygen electronic 2p band center has been proposed to capture the basic physical properties of oxides, including oxygen vacancy formation energy, diffusion barrier of oxygen ions, and work function. Moreover, the adsorption strength of relevant reaction intermediates at the surface of oxides can be strongly correlated with the energy of the oxygen 2p states, which affects the catalytic activity of reactions, such as oxygen electrocatalysis, and oxidative dehydrogenation of organic molecules. Such descriptors for catalytic activity can be used to predict the activity of new catalysts and understand trends and behavior among different catalysts.In this Account, we discuss how the energy of the oxygen 2p states can be used as a descriptor for oxide bulk and surface chemical properties. We show how the oxide redox properties vary linearly with the position of the oxygen 2p band center with respect to the Fermi level, and we discuss how this descriptor can be expanded across different materials and structural families, including possible generalizations to compounds outside oxides. We highlight the power of the oxygen 2p band center to predict the catalytic activity of oxides. We conclude with an outlook examining under which conditions this descriptor can be applied to predict oxide properties and possible opportunities for further refining and accelerating property predictions of oxides by leveraging material databases and machine learning.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000746476900001	35050573

Among monodisperse 4, 6, 8, and 10 nm NPs tested, the 8 nm Au NPs show the maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) (up to 90% at -0.67 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). Density functional theory calculations suggest that more edge sites (active for CO evolution) than corner sites (active for the competitive H-2 evolution reaction) on the Au NP surface facilitates the stabilization of the reduction intermediates, such as COOH*, and the formation of CO. This mechanism is further supported by the fact that Au NPs embedded in a matrix of butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate for more efficient COOH* stabilization exhibit even higher reaction activity (3 A/g mass activity) and selectivity (97% FE) at -0.52 V (vs RHE). The work demonstrates the great potentials of using monodisperse Au NPs to optimize the available reaction intermediate binding sites for efficient and selective electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO.									958	52	0	0	83	0	970			0002-7863			WOS:000327103600023	24156631

The transition metal oxides (CuO, TiO2, NiO, Co2O3, etc.,) have been desirable for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolyte. Among these transition metal oxides, the CuO based composites are most promising constituents for the water oxidation process due to their good electronic properties and the anticipated synergistic effect to alter the surface properties of the materials dramatically to favor the electrocatalysis. Here, we have reported the synthesis of CuO-SnO2 nanoparticles network by a facile chemical method as the electrocatalyst for an efficient OER. The physiochemical properties of CuO-SnO2 nanoparticles network electrocatalyst were characterized by using various techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for their structural, absorption/presence of functional groups, elemental composition and morphology, respectively. Further, the electrochemical properties of the catalysts were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronopotentiometry and Tafel curve measurements in alkaline electrolyte. The electrocatalysts showed a low onset potential of 1.39 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and high stability for 6 h in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, which demonstrated their better performance than the benchmark Ni electrocatalyst.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0947-8396	1432-0630		WOS:000606859900001

In this respect transition metal-doped mixed-metal selenides incorporating earth abundant elements such as Ni and Fe have attracted attention due to their unexpectedly high electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with low overpotential in alkaline medium. In this article, quaternary mixed-metal selenide compositions incorporating Ni-Fe-Co were investigated through combinatorial electrodeposition by exploring the ternary phase diagram of Ni-Fe-Co systems. The OER electrocatalytic activity of the resultant quaternary and ternary mixed metal selenide compositions was measured in order to systematically investigate the trend of catalytic activity as a function of catalyst composition. Accordingly, the composition(s) exhibiting the best catalytic efficiency for the quaternary Fe-Co-Ni mixed-metal selenide was identified. It was observed that the quaternary selenide outperformed the binary as well as the ternary metal selenides in this Ni-Fe-Co phase space. The elemental composition and relative abundance of the elements in the catalyst film was ascertained from energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Mapping of the OER catalytic activity as a function of catalyst composition indicated that catalytic efficiency was more pronounced in the Fe rich region with moderate amounts of Ni and trace amounts of Co doping, and the best performance was exhibited by (Ni0.25Fe0.68Co0.07)(3)Se-4, which showed an overpotential of 230 mV (vs RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2) with stability exceeding 8 h for continuous oxygen generation. It was also observed that typically the quaternary metal selenide composition was close to AB(2)Se(4), which shows a spinel structure type. Electrochemical measurements along with density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to correlate the enhancement of catalytic activity toward the Fe-rich region with composition. First principles DFT calculations were used to estimate the hydroxyl adsorption energy (E-ads) on the surface of the mixed-metal selenides with varying compositions. This adsorption energy could be directly correlated to the onset of OER activity, and the results matched very well with the experimentally observed trend with respect to onset overpotential. The knowledge of the trend of catalytic activity as a function of composition will be very important for catalyst design through targeted material synthesis. This work represents an example of a systematic phase exploration for quaternary metal selenides and provides a strong foundation which can be expanded to study other mixed-metal selenide combinations.									56	4	0	0	3	0	58			2155-5435			WOS:000444364800056		
J	Diaz, Mauricio C.; Balbuena, Perla B.								On the role of surface oxygen during nascent single-walled carbon nanotube cap spreading and tube nucleation on iron catalysts								CARBON				184				470	478		10.1016/j.carbon.2021.08.049		AUG 2021		OCT 30 2021	2021	Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are commonly grown in oxygen-rich environments. The precursor used as input for the SWCNT synthesis reaction typically provides oxygen atoms either as a pure gas or as an oxygen-containing compound. Similarly, metal oxide substrates are used to support the catalysts or as reactor wall materials and can transfer oxygen atoms while in contact with the catalytic particles. It has been proposed and experimentally observed that the interaction of the metal catalyst with specific promoters (e.g., oxygen, sulfur, hydrogen) triggers significant changes in the SWCNT properties during spreading, nucleation and growth. However, very few studies address the carbon catalyst surface interactions in rich oxygen environments. Here we show that an increased surface oxygen concentration in the neighborhood of a spreading nascent carbon shell reduces the strength of interaction of the carbon shell with the iron catalyst's surface and increases the probability of carbon nucleation and SWCNT lift-off. The evolution of the carbon-surface interaction during the spreading and nucleation phases suggests that closed pentagons at the rim are preferentially formed in oxidized iron surfaces, and they exhibit the strongest and most stable interaction with the iron surface.

A wide range of electrode materials have been investigated, with some providing resistance low enough for cell operation below 700 degrees C, but it is generally found that the electrode performance degrades over time. Here we demonstrate an oxygen electrode material, Sr(Ti0.3Fe0.7-xCox)O3- (STFC), that provides a unique combination of excellent oxygen electrode performance and long-term stability. The addition of a relatively small amount of Co to Sr(Ti0.3Fe0.7)O3-, e.g., x = 0.07, reduces the electrode polarization resistance by >2 times. The STFC electrode yields stable performance in both fuel cell and electrolysis modes at 1 A cm(-2). The fundamental oxygen diffusion and surface exchange coefficients of STFC are determined, and shown to be substantially better than those of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-, the most widely used SOC oxygen electrode material. While other electrode materials have been shown to exhibit better oxygen transport coefficients than STFC, they do not match its stability.									71	5	0	0	1	0	71			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000438392400022

Evolution of an [FeFe] hydrogenase with decreased oxygen sensitivity								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				37	3			2965	2976		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2011.02.048				FEB 2012	2012	[FeFe] hydrogenases catalyze the rapid combination of protons and electrons into hydrogen, but their oxygen sensitivity limits their use in clean renewable hydrogen production applications. The catalytic activity of current [FeFe] hydrogenases is destroyed by oxygen. Here, the discovery of mutant [FeFe] hydrogenases with decreased oxygen sensitivity is described. The new hydrogenases are derived from [FeFe] hydrogenase I of Clostridium pasteurianum (CpI). A cell-free protein synthesis-based screening platform was used to identify an initial mutant from a randomly mutated CpI library. Three mutations were cooperatively responsible for the decreased oxygen sensitivity, and further improvements were identified by saturation mutagenesis at the influential sites. After oxygen exposure under conditions where the enzyme is in the resting state, the mutant hydrogenase retains significantly higher methyl viologen reduction activity than the wildtype enzyme. However, surprisingly, when the enzyme is actively catalyzing hydrogen production during oxygen exposure, the mutant hydrogenase shows no improved oxygen tolerance. This observation highlights the complexity of the oxygen inactivation process in CpI and demonstrates the need to develop a screen that measures hydrogenase oxygen tolerance during catalysis.

J	Lu Xiuli; Han Yingying; Lu Tongbu					Lu, Xiuli/0000-0001-7639-9570			Structure Characterization and Application of Graphdiyne in Photocatalytic and Electrocatalytic Reactions								ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA				34	9			1014	1028		10.3866/PKU.WHXB201801171				2018	2018	Graphdiyne (GDY) is a new booming carbon material with a highly pi-conjugated structure that consists of sp- and sp(2)-hybridized carbon atoms. Due to the diverse compositions of the carbon atoms, GDYs can be divided into several forms based on their structure and periodicity. Until 2010, gamma-GDY has been successfully synthesized and becomes a new member of the carbon family. Many researchers have subsequently devoted their attention to the study of GDY. Compared to the traditional carbon materials, GDY exhibits a unique carbon network and electronic structure, thereby attracting considerable attention in a variety of fields. With the development of its synthetic chemistry, many types of GDY with different structures have been synthesized and characterized. The characterization of their micromorphology is crucial for studying the synthesis procedure and understanding the properties of GDY materials. At present, the developed method can characterize GDY morphology, crystal structure, and the chemical bonds of the carbon atoms. Specifically, the morphology and thickness of GDY can be evaluated by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The crystal structure can be investigated using X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The chemical bonding of the carbon atoms can be analyzed by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13 NMR), UV-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectroscopy, etc. However, methods for the rapid and nondestructive characterization of the highly crystalline graphdiyne are still absent, restricting the study of the intrinsic properties of GDY. Due to the unique electronic and porous structure of GDY, it has been the focus of extensive investigations in the field of catalysis. As a result of its favorable electronic structure and good capability for transferring photoexcited electrons and holes, GDY can enhance light absorption and facilitate the separation of photoexcited charge carriers in semiconductors and thereby significantly promote their photocatalytic performance. In addition, GDY can be modified using foreign elements, providing an ideal platform to prepare a highly active catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, etc. Furthermore, GDY can be synthesized on arbitrary substrates in a three-dimensional nanosheet array structure, which can provide a large number of channels for the transfer of electrons and a large contact area with the reactant, which is beneficial in electrocatalytic reactions. This review focused on the recent developments in characterization methods as well as the photo and electrocatalysis applications of GDY, and elaborated the opportunities and challenges for the investigation of GDY in the future.									20	10	0	0	2	0	21			1000-6818			WOS:000431609200005

However, boosting the catalytic activity of a specific plane still faces significant challenges. Herein, a strategy of adding water into the electrolyte is developed to construct a LiOH-based Li-O-2 battery system using the (111) plane-exposed Co3O4 as a cathode catalyst. The electrochemical performance shows that on the (111) plane, in the presence of water, the overpotential is largely reduced from 1.5 to 1.0 V and the cycling performance is enhanced. It is confirmed that during the discharge process, water reacts to form LiOH and induce the phase transformation of Co3O4 to amorphous CoOx(OH)(y). At the recharge stage, LiOH is first decomposed and then CoOx(OH)(y) is reduced to Co3O4. Compared with pristine (111), the newly formed Co3O4 surface exhibits more active sites, which accelerates the following oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution processes. This work not only reveals the reaction mechanism of water-induced reaction on the (111) plane of Co3O4 but also provides a new perspective for further design of hybrid Li-O-2 batteries with a low polarization and a longer cycle life.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000820675200001	35708256

We have explored these spinels as alternative low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). Herein, we have developed energy-saving, facile and rapid synthetic methodologies for highly active spinel electrocatalysts. Two spinel phases, cubic Co2MnO4 and tetragonal CoMn2O4 have been successfully obtained by tuning the stoichiometric ratio of Co and Mn salts respectively. These CoMn2O4 and Co2MnO4 nanocubes have been used as bifunctional catalysts towards OER and ORR. Electrocatalytic experiments show that cubic Co2MnO4 nanocubes show five times higher activity towards ORR than tetragonal CoMn2O4 nanocubes while the tetragonal phase is a better electrocatalyst towards OER than the cubic Co2MnO4 phase. XPS studies revealed two types of oxygen (lattice O and surface adsorbed O species like OH-) and the efficiency of the catalyst could be related to the binding affinity of oxygen. This explains the better catalytic activity of cubic Co2MnO4 which has a large percentage of adsorbed oxygen species. The stability of the catalyst was confirmed by carrying out TEM studies on a sample after carrying out 25 cycles. Magnetization experiments reveal that both the tetragonal CoMn2O4 as well as cubic Co2MnO4 show hysteresis at 10 K and 100 K without reaching saturation, which confirms an existing ferrimagnetic order in the samples. Both the tetragonal and cubic phases show T-c similar to 110 K and 150 K respectively.									33	1	0	0	1	0	34			2046-2069			WOS:000362851000081

Transitional metals with incompletely filled d orbitals are expected to have intrinsic electronic interaction to promote the reaction kinetics, however, the construction of multiple active sites is still a bottleneck problem. Here, inspired by an amorphous alloy design strategy with chemical tunability, a noble-metal-free FeCoMoPB amorphous nanoplate for superior alkaline water oxidation is developed. The achieved overpotentials at current densities of 10, 100, and 500 mA cm(-2) are 239, 281, and 331 mV, respectively, while retaining a reliable stability of 48 h, outperforming most currently available electrocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the chemical complexity of the amorphous nanoplate leads to the formation of multiple active sites that is able to greatly lower the free energy of the rate-determining step during the water oxidation reaction. Moreover, the Mo element would result in an electron delocalization behavior to promote electron redistribution at its surrounding regions for readily donating and taking electrons. This amorphous alloy design strategy is expected to stimulate the development of more efficient electrocatalysts that is applicable in energy devices, such as metal-air batteries, fuel cells, and water electrolysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000865559000001	36216584

However, achieving long-lasting and repeatable voltage-reversal tolerance remains a challenge. Herein, we propose highly robust bilayered RTAs consisting of IrOx and Pt black layers (IrOx//Pt) for use in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. Compared to bi-layered IrOx//Pt/C RTAs, the carbon-free IrOx//Pt RTAs have an exceptionally longer voltage-reversal time and unprecedented level of repeatability. Additionally, placing the IrOx layer on the membrane side of the RTA is more effective in maintaining the water oxidation reaction than placing it on the diffusion layer side. Oxidative dissolution of IrOx in the IrOx//Pt RTAs under repeated voltage reversals emphasizes the importance of lowering the water oxidation potential of RTA. The carbon-free, bi-layered RTA design presented in this work provides a new path for achieving long-lasting and repeatable voltagereversal tolerance.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are attractive because of their maximum atom utilization efficiency, tunable electronic structures, and outstanding catalytic performance. Of particular note, transition-metal SACs exhibit excellent catalytic activity and selectivity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)-an important half reaction in fuel cells and metal-air batteries as well as for portable hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Although considerable efforts have been made on the synthesis of SACs for ORR, the regulation of the coordination environments of SACs and thus the electronic structures still pose a big challenge. In this review, strategies for manipulating the coordination environments of SACs are classified into three categories, including regulation of the center metal atoms, manipulation of the surrounding environment connecting to the center metal atom, and modification of the geometric configuration of the support. Finally, some issues regarding the future development of SACs for ORR are raised and possible solutions are proposed.									105	8	0	0	6	0	106			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000594089000001

Here we synthesized two dimensional (2D) C3N4 nanosheets supported palladium composites (C3N4/Pd) via a simple and convenient sonochemical approach. We have systematically studied the electrocatalytic performance of as-prepared catalysts. We found that the prepared C3N4/Pd composites possessed excellent catalytic activity and stability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media. Encouragingly, the C3N4/Pd catalysts exhibit the excellent electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in alkaline media, even better than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of the 2D C3N4 nanosheets supported palladium composites catalysts results from their synergy effect between the ultrathin substrate material with large surface area and excellent dispersion of palladium nanoparticles.

It was found that titanium dioxide formed as a result of titanyl citrate thermolysis with the following products: rutile nanocrystals, itaconic acid, and carbon dioxide. Rutile nanocrystals were rod-shaped and oriented in the (101) crystallographic direction. The position of the rutile nanocrystals in the spherulites and pores between the nanocrystals lead to high electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline aqueous solutions. The process is characterized by a Tafel slope of 49 mV/dec.									10	0	3	0	0	0	10			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000564524300004

Glucose and sucrose enhance notably the activity for hydrogen generation. The amounts of produced H-2 increase almost proportionally to time within 5 h irradiation in the reaction systems of the two electron donors. The effect of the initial concentration of glucose and sucrose on the reaction rate is consistent with the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model. After 5 h irradiation, the COD(chemical oxygen demand) in the reaction system of glucose and in that of sucrose decrease by 33.2%, 11.4% respectively. The effect of electron donors on the flat-band potential of conduction band of TiO2 electrode was investigated. The flat-band potential of conduction band of TiO2 electrode in the presence of the electron donors shifts negatively, and the shift in the presence of glucose is larger than that in the presence of sucrose due to glucose having a larger adsorption amount on TiO2.									20	11	0	0	2	0	27			0251-0790			WOS:000243581800039

Herein, hierarchical hollow NiCo-LDH/MnO2 hybrid nanostructures derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are successfully constructed as cathodes for Li-O-2 batteries to fundamentally improve the decomposition kinetics of Li2O2. The hollow NiCo-LDH/MnO2 nanostructures assembled by hollow NiCo-LDH and MnO2 nanosheets possess a highly special surface area, abundant open active sites, and a fast diffusion path for Li+ and oxygen species. As expected, accelerated sluggish oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction kinetics and reduced charge/discharge overpotentials can be obtained. The toroidal Li2O2 assembled by nanoflakes formed on the surface of the cathode can be conducive to form a low-impedance Li2O2/cathode contact interface to achieve the reversible formation and decomposition of Li2O2. The Li-O-2 battery based on the NiCo-LDH/MnO2 cathode shows a high charge/discharge specific capacity of 13,380 mA h at 100 mA and a continuous cycling stability for 162 cycles at a fixed capacity of 500 mAh g(-1) as well as a low overpotential of 0.63 V. Moreover, the application of MOF-derived porous hierarchical nanostructures expands the selection range of electrocatalysts and offers a new idea of structure design for Li-O-2 batteries.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2574-0962			WOS:000613720100010

Through the application of the green energy technique, hydrogen used in fuel cells can be obtained from electrolysers. Platinum group metals (PGMs) are normally used to electrocatalyse the reactions, such as hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) and oxy-gen reduction reaction (ORR), which occur in fuel cells and electrolysers. This work reports the develop-ment and application of electrocatalysts with suitable properties using Co and Mo oxides with or without MoSe2 and in combination or not with graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), which are capable of supporting low amount of Pt and are highly efficient for OER and HER. Based on the results obtained, CoMoSe/GNR was found to be the best and most stable electrocatalyst for OER. The improvements observed in OER eletrocatalytic properties were attributed to the synergistic effects of binary metal ions, including Co2 +, Co3 +, Mo4 +, and Mo6+ (transition metals intercalated across the nanostructures, with Co2+ and Mo4+ act -ing as active sites), as well as the interactions between the metals and ion support (geometric effects, charge transfer) and between the different oxides em ployed. PtCoMo was found to be the best and most stable electrocatalyst for HER. The improvements observed in HER properties were attributed to the pres-ence of Pt0 and Pt2 +metal/ions supported on CoMo structures - the strong interaction between Pt and Co/Mo oxides on PtCoMo nanocomposites interface produced electron-deficient Pt delta+ species - and the synergistic effects involving the Pt metal/ions and the binary metal ions, including Co2 +, Co3 +, Mo4 +, and Mo6+ (transition metals intercalated across the nanostructures), in the reaction process. A significantly low amount of Pt (4.5 mu gPt cm -2) was used for the construction of the PtCoMo/CP electrode.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the role of SAS has been neglected for photoreduction reactions. Here, we report a Lewis acid site (L-acid) rich TiO2 prepared using the synergistic effect of ethanol and halogen ions. The formation of L-acid improves the adsorption and mobility of O-2, which facilitates its reduction into a superoxide radical (O-2(-)). L-acid may lift the population of photogenerated electrons (e(-)), which is concluded from the presence of a CH3 signal in the DMPO-O-2(-) ESR spectrum of only L-acid rich TiO2. In addition, L-acid enhances the migration of photogenerated holes (h(+)) to the surface of the catalyst, which induces a continuous photooxidation reaction of H2O or -OH. Therefore, L-acid simultaneously enhances the photoredox ROS generation reaction, resulting in higher photocatalytic activity. This work illustrates a dual function of L-acid and provides a useful strategy for improving the photocarrier separation and surface reaction efficiency.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000730763400001

Herein, double-shelled NiFe PBAs nanocages have been synthesized through an ion-exchange reaction between K3Fe(CN)(6) and single-shelled Ni(OH)(2) nanocages based on the regulation of nanoscale Kirkendall effect driven by the crystallinity difference between Ni(OH)(2) and NiFe PBAs. With further mild thermal activation, carbon-nitrogen (CN) vacancies could be formed in situ in large quantities in the double-shelled NiFe PBAs nanocages. Theoretical calculation and experimental results prove that the rationally designed double-shelled NiFe PBAs nanocages with an abundance of the exposed surface have a lower energy barrier for the departure of CN groups from NiFe PBAs lattices, and thus generate CN vacancies with a concentration as high as 18.5% via a mild thermal activation strategy, which far outweigh the content of CN vacancies in the solid NiFe PBAs nanocubes. The as-prepared NiFe PBAs with abundant CN vacancies have an impressive OER activity with a low overpotential of 267 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) and long-term stability with only similar to 2.1% potential increase after 78 h. The opened double-shelled structure of NiFe PBAs nanocages offers highly exposed active sites and fast charge transfer kinetics. Moreover, post characterizations demonstrate the important role of CN vacancies in the suppression of Fe loss during the OER process and formation of Fe species as the active sites. This study provides an effective strategy to explore PBAs catalysts with desired nanostructures and defective multiplicity for enhanced OER catalysis.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000651856100001

Herein, we use Co-doped lanthanum ferrite as a model to study the effect of doping on the B-site exsolution of Fe-based perovskite. CoFe alloy can be exsolved from La0.9Fe0.9Co0.1O3 (LFCO) after heat treatment at 500 degrees C in a reduced atmosphere, whereas Fe will not be exsolved from La0.9FeO3 (LFO). Density functional theory calculations revealed that the stability of LFCO decreased after Co is doped into the lanthanum ferrite perovskite lattice and the formation energy of the Co-Fe bond on the surface of LFCO is lower than that of Fe-Fe in LFO, which promises an easier exsolution of CoFe alloy than the pristine Fe cluster. In addition, owing to the strong interaction and charge transfer between the exsolved CoFe alloy and parent perovskite, as well as the longer Fe-O bond after exsolution, the exsolved composite can act as an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions. Our work not only reveals the mechanism of the alloy exsolution in Fe-based perovskites but also provides a potential route to prepare the highly efficient electrocatalysts.									19	1	0	0	0	0	20			2168-0485			WOS:000507429100035

Cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanoparticles are state-of-the-art electrocatalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the structure reactivity correlations are not straightforward because the nanoparticles will restructure under working conditions. Employing a protective sample transfer procedure, we use simple lab XPS to unveil the changes in oxidation state and composition of the nanoparticle surface induced by electrochemical reaction conditions. CoP nanoparticles are naturally oxidized on their surface. In alkaline electrolyte under HER conditions, a Co-rich phosphide surface is generated as a result of polyphosphate dissolution and reduction of the oxidized P and Co species. In alkaline electrolyte under OER conditions, an oxidation and dissolution process occurs, and the surface evolves into hydroxide/oxide with a subtle amount of phosphate residue. In acidic electrolyte under HER conditions, the surface oxidation layer is dissolved by the electrolyte, and a fresh CoP surface is exposed. These surface restructuring results help rationalizing the electrocatalytic reactivity of CoP nanoparticles for water splitting under various electrochemical conditions.									53	3	0	0	5	0	53			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000424955400044

Herein, a simple electrospinning-pyrolysis strategy is developed to directly immobilize uniform Ni3Co nanoparticles into a hierarchical branched architecture constructed by in situ formed N-doped carbon-nanotube-grafted carbon nanofibers. The elaborate construction of such hybrid hierarchical architecture can effectively modulate the electronic structure of the active sites, enlarge the exposure of active sites, and facilitate the electron transfer and mass diffusion, favoring both the HER and OER. As a result, the optimized catalyst requires relatively low overpotentials of 114 and 243 mV for HER and OER, respectively, to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 m KOH electrolyte. When employed as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting, the resultant catalyst shows a low cell voltage of 1.57 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), along with an impressive stability without noticeable attenuation even after 27 h. This work presents a successful demonstration in optimizing the electrocatalytic performance of Ni-based bifunctional electrocatalysts by simultaneously considering modulation of electronic structure, hybridization with carbon substrate, and nanostructuring through a facile synthetic strategy, which provides a new avenue to the design of a rich variety of robust transition-metal-based electrocatalysts for large-scale water electrolysis.									75	7	0	0	9	0	77				2198-3844		WOS:000499704200001	31921570

Taking NiCo2O4 as a model system, we have experimentally established a facile calcination and electrochemical activation (EA) methodology to dramatically increase the concentration of OVs and provide theoretical insight into how the concentration of OVs affects the performance of spinel TMOs towards the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A self-supported cathode of OV-rich NiCo2O4 nanowire arrays was found to exhibit higher HER activity and better stability in alkaline media than its counterparts with fewer OVs. The electrocatalytic HER activity was in good agreement with the increasing concentration of OVs in the studied samples. A large current density of 360 mA.cm(-2) was reached with an overpotential of only 317 mV. Additionally, such a facile strategy was able to efficiently generate OVs in other TMOs (e.g., CoFe2O4 and NiFe2O4) for enhanced HER performance. In addition, our theoretical results suggest that the increasing OV concentration reduces the adsorption energy of water molecules and their dissociation energy barrier on the surface of the catalyst, thus leading to performance improvement of spinel TMOs toward the electrochemical HER. This work may open a new avenue to increase the concentration of OVs in TMOs in a controlled manner for promising applications in a variety of fields.									108	6	0	0	3	0	109			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000419959500001

However, few single photocatalysts can intrinsically satisfy the requirements of high solar energy conversion efficiency and photocatalytic redox reactions. Using first-principles calculations, we propose the experimentally attainable 2D LiMX2 (M = Al, Ga, In; X = S, Se, Te) bilayers as ideal candidates to achieve this goal, taking advantage of the intrinsic electric field effect. They have direct band gaps, higher carrier mobility and a wide light absorption range, which are beneficial to the photocatalytic performance. The intrinsic electric field not only promotes the spatial separation of photogenerated carriers, but also contributes to high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency with an upper limit of 20.1-36.6%. Similar results have also been found for LiMX2 multilayers. More interestingly, the strong photocatalytic redox ability of the LiGaS2 bilayer makes the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) proceed, driven solely by the photogenerated electrons and holes in pure water (pH = 7). These results indicate that the LiMX2 bilayers could be utilized for efficient photocatalytic overall water splitting in pure water without the need for sacrificial reagents or cocatalysts.									22	1	0	0	0	0	22			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000509471800040

By simply mixing the reactants under ambient conditions, (NH4)(2)MoS4/polydopamine (PDA) hybrid nanospheres are formed. The protonated dopamine is linked to tetrahedral [MoS4](2-) via weak N-H center dot center dot center dot S and O-H center dot center dot center dot S interactions, causing the PDA nanospheres merging together and forming nanorods under stirring induced shear force. Moreover, the oxidative polymerization of dopamine proceeds on the surface of the nanorods, whereas it is prohibited inside the nanorods owing to lack of oxygen, leading to outward diffusion of dopamine and hence cavitation. After annealing, the tubular morphology is perfectly retained, while ultrafine MoS2 monolayers are formed due to the confinement of the framework. Benefiting from these unique structural features, the MoS2/C hybrid nanotubes possess abundant active sites and high surface area, as well as boost electronic and ionic transport, remarkably enhancing their electrocatalytic activities. The onset and half-wave potentials are 0.91 and 0.82 V, respectively, for ORR, close to those of Pt/C. Moreover, low onset potential and small Tafel slope are also observed for HER, demonstrating the potential of the hybrid nanotubes as a promising non-noble metal bifunctional electrocatalyst.									18	1	0	0	2	0	18			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000439528400034	29944337

Perovskite oxides with flexible and tunable electronic structures as functional electrocatalysts towards the OER have been investigated for decades. Various strategies for highly efficient perovskite catalysts have been proposed; however, precise insights are still lacking due to the diverse metal compositions and tunable structures. Among them, controlling the composition of the transition metals at the B-site of the double perovskite was considered as a dominant parameter to improve the electrocatalytic activity. It is known that several Co-based perovskites exhibit extraordinary OER activities and stabilities when the B-site is partially occupied by Fe. To elucidate the function of B-site tuning of perovskite oxides, PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co2-xFexO5+delta (PBSCF) catalysts with various x values were prepared. Interestingly, via X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis we found that the PBSCF catalysts coexist with layered perovskite (LP) structures and randomly ordered perovskite (RP) structures. In parallel, density functional theory computational calculations were conducted to provide theoretical insights into our research results. Our findings show that doping Fe into Co-based perovskite oxides alters the intrinsic properties, yielding efficient OER activity and prolonged stability (@ 100 mA cm(-2) over 2000 hours).									4	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000732835300001

Pt and CoOx were loaded on AgTaO3 by photodeposition, and the obtained photocatalysts were characterized by using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), and microscope inspection. By the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) inspection, the diameters of Pt and CoOx particles were found to be approximately 30 and 50 nm, respectively. When AgTaO3 photocatalyst loaded with Pt and CoOx nanoparticles was employed for water splitting, the activity was demonstrated to be 80 times higher compared with the bare AgTaO3, indicating that the photodeposited Pt and CoOx effectively functioned as the hydrogen (H-2) and oxygen (O-2) evolution cocatalysts, respectively. While the use of photodeposited CoOx, is often limited in photoelectrochemical water oxidation and photocatalytic half-reaction of water, CoOx deposited on AgTaO3 could be demonstrated to enhance the photocatalytic overall water splitting activity.

Temperatures higher than 350 A degrees C were required for methane oxidation to produce CO and CO2, any other products of methane partial oxidation being not found. High activity of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts towards propylene and toluene oxidation was found to be determined by zeolite porous structure and capability to adsorb rapidly mentioned hydrocarbons.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1380-2224	1573-4854		WOS:000350891300026

Conventional cross-couplings are transition metal-catalyzed reactions between electrophiles and nucleophiles. Generally, the electrophilic partner is an aryl or alkenyl halide, the nucleophile is an organometallic reagent, and both are obtained from prefunctionalization of their corresponding hydrocarbons. During the past decade, transition metal-catalyzed dehydrogenative cross-couplings between two carbon hydrogen (C-H) bonds and between one C-H bond and one heteroatom hydrogen (X-H) bond, which build a C-C and a C-X linkage respectively, have emerged as an attractive strategy in synthetic chemistry. Such straightforward couplings allow use of less functionalized reagents, thus reducing the number of steps to the target molecule and minimizing waste production. However, such reactions involve the use of stoichiometric amounts of sacrificial oxidants such as peroxides, high-valent metals, and iodine(III) oxidants. This leads to low atom economy and possible generation of toxic wastes.Recently, visible light photocatalytic dehydrogenative cross-coupling reactions have received much attention due to their potential in utilizing sunlight as a source of energy making the process appealing. In this approach, metal complexes, organic dyes, or semiconductor quantum dots that absorb visible light are employed as photocatalysts. Upon irradiation, photocatalyst initiates single electron transfer with substrate(s) to generate a radical cation or radical anion of the substrate, which undergoes the desired reaction of interest. In this case, molecular oxygen is utilized as the oxidant with the formation of hydrogen peroxide as the only byproduct. These aspects make the process much greener than the corresponding transition metal-catalyzed dehydrogenative cross-coupling reactions. Research efforts from our group have led to the development of an environmentally benign strategy to construct a C-C bond from two different C-H bonds and to construct a C-X bond from one C-H bond and one X-H bond by visible light photocatalysis. Our approach, photocatalytic hydrogen-evolution cross-coupling reactions, combines a photocatalyst with a proton reduction cocatalyst to create a dual catalyst system. The former catalyst uses light energy as the driving force for the cross-coupling, while the latter catalyst may capture electrons from the substrates or reaction intermediates to reduce the protons eliminated from the reactive scaffolds (C-H/C-H or C-H/X-H bonds) into molecular hydrogen (H-2). Thus, without use of any sacrificial oxidant and under mild conditions, our dual catalyst system affords cross coupling products with excellent yields with generation of an equimolar amount of H-2 as the sole byproduct.The photocatalytic hydrogen-evolution cross-coupling is highly step and atom economical and particularly useful for reactions that involve species sensitive to oxidative conditions. This Account highlights the findings from our laboratories on photocatalytic hydrogen-evolution cross-coupling reactions featuring activation and functionalization of C(sp(3))-H bonds adjacent to amino groups and to oxygen atoms in ethers, aromatic C(sp(2))-H bonds, and several types of X-H bonds. We expect that this strategy for combining photocatalytic activation of C-H and X-H bonds with proton reduction holds significant potential for development of atom economical and environmentally benign transformations.									143	16	0	0	30	0	145			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000447816000017	30280898

Thanks to immense research efforts, up-to-date oxygen evolution electrocatalysts based on earth-abundant elements work efficiently and stably in neutral and alkaline regimes. However, non-noble metal-based anode materials that can withstand low pH regimes are considered to be an indispensable prerequisite for the water splitting to succeed in the future. All oxygen-evolving electrodes working durably and actively in acids contain Ir at least as an additive. Due to their scarcity and high acquisition costs, noble elements like Pt, Ru and Ir need to be replaced by earth-abundant elements. We have evaluated a Ni-containing stainless steel for use as an oxygen-forming electrode in diluted H2SO4. Unmodified Ni42 steel showed a significant weight loss after long-term OER polarization experiments. Moreover, a substantial loss of the OER performance of the untreated steel specimen seen in linear sweep voltammetry measurements turned out to be a serious issue. However, upon anodization in LiOH, Ni42 alloy was rendered in OER electrocatalysts that exhibit, under optimized synthesis conditions, stable overpotentials down to 445 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at pH 0. Even more importantly, the resulting material has been proven to be robust upon long-term usage (weight loss: 20 mu g mm(-2) after 50 ks of chronopotentiometry at pH 1) towards OER in H2SO4. Our results suggest that electrochemical oxidation of Ni42 steel in LiOH (sample Ni42Li205) results in the formation of a metal oxide-containing outer zone that supports solution route-based oxygen evolution in the acidic regime accompanied by good stability of the catalyst.									21	1	0	0	1	0	21			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000433517700011		
J	Yu, Liang; Zhang, Gaowei; Chen, Huanhui; Zeng, Junrong; Liu, Ya; Yang, Qixin; Zhong, Liubiao; Qiu, Yejun								Ultrathin hollow hemisphere-carbon-anchored Ni3FeN nanoparticles as nanoreactors facilitating the formation of NiCx with long-term durability for the oxygen evolution reaction								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				10	14			7911	7919		10.1039/d1ta10670h		FEB 2022		APR 5 2022	2022	Developing highly active, durable, and low-cost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is crucial for the practical implementation of water splitting. Here, a unique category of OER catalyst is prepared via anchoring Ni3FeN nanoparticles onto hollow hemisphere-carbon (HC) to create a nanoreactor for the OER, and the nanoreactors are fabricated in situ on commercial nickel foam (denoted as Ni3FeN-HC/NF) to act as a catalytic electrode. The optimized Ni3FeN-HC/NF electrode shows an ultralow overpotential of 219 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a low Tafel slope of 63 mV dec(-1), and it also exhibits excellent durability for up to 72 h without significant deactivation. Such superior performance is caused by the introduction of HC. HC, as an ultrathin layer with a large specific surface area, serves as an electrocatalytic support to downsize and tightly anchor Ni3FeN nanoparticles, enhancing charge transfer and avoiding the aggregation of Ni3FeN nanoparticles, thereby achieving high electrocatalytic activity and long-term durability. At the same time, our work also reveals that unstable amorphous carbon from HC allows some Ni3FeN to convert into NiCx on the surface of the Ni3FeN nanoparticles under OER conditions. The formation of this NiCx layer can alleviate the aggregation of Ni3FeN nanoparticles, further enhancing the stability. The relatively low-cost electrocatalyst with long-term stability reported in this work is expected to inspire more innovative research to advance the commercial and practical feasibility of alkaline water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000765851700001

In this study, a polyaniline-multiwalled carbon nanotube (PANI-MWCNT) supported, high performance CoFe2O4 nanoparticle (NP) loaded electrocatalyst (CoFe2O4/PANI-MWCNTs) is synthesized through a novel and simple in situ process under mild conditions. It is found that the introduction of PANI improves the synergistic effect between the CoFe2O4 NPs and MWCNTs, so as to promote the electrical conductivity and stability of the catalyst. Meanwhile, PANI provides more active sites to attach CoFe2O4 NPs uniformly and tightly. Electrochemical measurement shows that the electrocatalyst displays excellent OER activities at a low overpotential of 314 mV for 10 mA cm(-2) current density and a small Tafel slope of 30.69 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH at a scan rate of 5 mV s(-1). Furthermore, this electrocatalyst exhibits remarkably good durability evaluated by continuously cycling for 1000 cycles and stably working at 0.54 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for at least 40 h. The achieved results confirm that the CoFe2O4/PANI-MWCNT hybrid is an earth-abundant and cheaply fabricated anode material for OER.									143	1	0	0	4	0	144			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000372190800019

A variation of the fundamental constants is expected to affect the thermonuclear rates important for stellar nucleosynthesis. In particular, because of the very low resonant energies of Be-8 and C-12, the triple alpha process is extremely sensitive to any such variations.Methods. Using a microscopic model for these nuclei, we derive the sensitivity of the Hoyle state to the nucleon-nucleon potential, thereby allowing for a change in the magnitude of the nuclear interaction. We follow the evolution of 15 and 60 M-circle dot zero-metallicity stellar models, up to the end of core helium burning. These stars are assumed to be representative of the first, Population III stars.Results. We derive limits on the variation in the magnitude of the nuclear interaction and model dependent limits on the variation of the fine structure constant based on the calculated oxygen and carbon abundances resulting from helium burning. The requirement that some C-12 and O-16 be present at the end of the helium burning phase allows for permille limits on the change in the nuclear interaction and limits of the order of 10(5) on the fine structure constant relevant at a cosmological redshift of z similar to 15-20.									34	0	0	0	1	0	34			1432-0746			WOS:000280504800029

Herein for the first time, a novel tube-like metal-carbon nanocomposite with encapsulated small-size individual Fe, Cr and Ni nanoparticles, is prepared by the carbonization of a FeCr-doped Ni-benzenetricarboxylate aerogel. The slender skeleton of the aerogel, supercritical drying and Cr doping alleviates metal aggregation and facilitates the in-situ growth of carbon tubes. This nanocomposite exhibits remarkably low overpotential of the hydrogen evolution reaction (137 mV) and oxygen evolution reaction (220 mV). Further, the cell voltage could be as low as 1.54 V with the current density of 10 mA cm-2 and illustrates excellent stability under a continuous operation for 50 h. This non-noble metal-base electrocatalyst is comparable to noble metal-based electrocatalysts and the impressive performance is ascribed to the abundant active catalytic sites and short reactant diffusion pathways. This work demonstrates great capability of aerogel derivation in the highly active electrocatalyst design for promising electrochemical applications. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

With an achievement by converting toxic contaminants into valuable products, this research explores the waste-turned treasures of exhaust PM pollution. Here, we rationally design a PM filter composed of homogeneously decorated zeolite imidazole framework-67 (ZIF-67) on a porous network of reduced graphene oxide aerogel (named as ZIF-67/rGA). The ZIF-67/rGA captures PM with excellent removal efficiency both in dynamic and static systems as a result of impressive specific surface area, continuous 3D networks, and numerous active sites. Highly porous Co3O4/N-rGA derived from PM@ZIF-67/rGA is achieved via an in situ thermal carbonization and activation process. The synergistic effect of porous Co3O4 nanoparticles and rich N-doped graphene aerogel contributes to the unprecedented electrochemical performance. Co3O4/N-rGA demonstrated a superior capacitance of 1485 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), which is superior to that of Co3O4/r-GA (249 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1)) obtained by direct pyrolysis of ZIF-67/r-GA. Meanwhile, it also displays an enhanced electrocatalytic performance (low overpotential of 367 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution. The findings provide a novel route to resolve environmental pollution and search for energy storage and conversion materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2052-1537		WOS:000631418600013

In the step of the recovery of the center metal of the organo-metal complex in the potential cycling from the reduction potential for Cu2+, by stepping up the anodic potential limit to the potential region for oxygen evolution reaction, the reionization of electrodeposited Cu could be suppressed in the presence of the dissolved oxygen. Moreover, separation of the electrodeposited Cu as nanoparticles from the electrode surface could be achieved by introducing the oxygen-containing functional groups on the diamond surface. The oxidation of the particle surface by the dissolved oxygen might induce the formation of the insulating layer and accelerate the separation by the electrostatic repulsive force between the oxygen-terminated surface and the insulating layer on the Cu particles. The reaction pathway of the Cu-EDTA treatment was analyzed using the long-term potential cycling at the potential region between the reduction potential of Cu and the oxidation potential of the EDTA. In flow injection analysis with the UV detector, the formation of the Cu particles by the reduction reaction of the Cu2+ ion from Cu-EDTA was clarified to mainly occur in the initial stage of the electrolysis. Moreover, in high-performance liquid chromatography analysis with the electrogenerated chemiluminescence detector for the treated solution, ethylenediaminetriacetic acid (ED3A) and ethylenediaminediacetic acid (EDDA) were observed. Therefore, it was confirmed that the liberated EDTA was oxidized to ED3A and EDDA through sequential removal of the acetate groups. An unidentified product (supposed to be the small size of a hydrocarbon) appeared after 100 h during the electrolysis. Although the concentration of this unidentified product was not decreased in the electrolysis with anodic potential limit of 2.3 V, the concentration decay for this product was observed for the potential cycling up to 3.0 V, suggesting that for the full oxidation of EDTA to CO2, it might be effective for the electrochemical oxidation by the OH radical available over 2.6 V at BDD.

As several types of chemical reactions are clearly involved in the solid-gas interactions at the film surface, it has been necessary to simplify the system by favouring interactions in absence of oxygen. Films were consequently also put in contact with N-2 or Ar mixed with small amounts of H-2, CO, H2S to favour behaviours in absence of oxygen gas. As under air + CO at 300 degrees C, important features of Pd/Pt-doped film conductance closely resemble CO2 production rates of CO oxidation at the surface of Pd aggregates reported in the literature, an attempt of interpretation of the conductance evolution has been made along this line. Under CO and H-2 mixed with neutral gas, dynamic (kinetic) electrical conductance measurements show that the dispersions of metallic elements induce a two-step time dependent behaviour. The first step is associated with a reduction of the oxygen molecules adsorbed at the SnO2 grain surface and an increase of electron density in the SnO2 depletion zone. The second step with a sharp conductance increase implies a reduction of the metallic aggregates and an electron transfer from the aggregates to the SnO2 grain conduction band. For H2S the conductance increases smoothly. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.									75	2	0	0	0	1	77				0925-4005		WOS:000084763000007

Here, we present a simple strategy to enhance the HER activity in alkaline media by engineering Co-doped MoS2 coupled with Mo2CTx MXene. The improved HER activity might be ascribed to the synergistic regulation of water dissociation sites and electronic conductivity. Co doping could effectively regulate the electronic structure of MoS2 and further improve the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. Mo2CTx MXene served as both the active and conductive substrate to facilitate electron transfer. As a result, the Co-MoS2/ Mo2CTx nanohybrids showed dramatically enhanced HER performance with a low overpotential of 112 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and exhibited excellent long-term stability in alkaline media.									80	8	0	0	7	0	83			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000470756000042	31140532

Proto IX-sensitized and singlet oxygen (O-1(2))-mediated oxidative stress caused by AF-Na treatment impaired photosystem I (PSI), photosystem II (PSII) and whole chain electron transport reactions. As compared to controls, the F-v/F-m (variable to maximal chlorophyll a fluorescence) ratio of treated samples was reduced. The PSII electron donor NH2OH failed to restore the F-v/F-m ratio suggesting that the reduction of F-v/F-m reflects the loss of reaction center functions. This explanation is further supported by the practically near-similar loss of PSI and PSII activities. As revealed from the light saturation curve (rate of oxygen evolution as a function of light intensity), the reduction of PSII activity was both due to the reduction in the quantum yield at limiting light intensities and impairment of light-saturated electron transport. In treated cotyledons both the Q (due to recombination of Q(A)(-) with S-2) and B (due to recombination of Q(B)(-) with S-2/S-3) band of thermo luminescence decreased by 50% suggesting a loss of active PSII reaction centers. In both the control and treated samples, the thermoluminescence yield of B band exhibited a periodicity of 4 suggesting normal functioning of the S states in centers that were still active. The low temperature (77 K) fluorescence emission spectra revealed that the F-695 band (that originates in CP-47) increased probably due to reduced energy transfer from the CP47 to the reaction center. These demonstrated an overall damage to the PSI and PSII reaction centers by O-1(2) produced in response to photosensitization reaction of proloporphyrin IX in AF-Na-treated cucumber seedlings.

Experiments were conducted on a Jet in Hot Coflow (JHC) burner, with the fuel jet issuing into a 1250-K coflow at three oxygen levels. Planar measurements using OH-LIF, CH2O-LIF, and Rayleigh scattering images reveal that the overall spatial distribution and evolution of OH, CH2O, and temperature were quite similar for the two fuels. For both the ethanol and the DME flames, a transitional flame structure occurred as the coflow oxygen level increased from 3% to 9%. This indicates that the flames shift away from the MILD combustion regime. Reaction flux analyses of ethanol and DME were performed with the OPPDIF code, and ethane (C2H6) was also included in the analyses for comparison. These analyses reveal that the H-2/O-2 pathways are very important for both ethanol and DME in the 3% O-2 cases. In contrast, the importance of fuel-specific reactions overtakes that of H-2/O-2 reactions when fuels are burnt in the cold air or in the vitiated oxidant stream with 9% 02. Unsteady laminar flamelet analyses were also performed to investigate the ignition processes and help interpret experimental results. Flamelet equations were solved in time and mixture fraction field, which was provided by non-reactive Large-Eddy Simulation (LES). (C) 2018 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

A One-Pot Route to Faceted FePt-Fe3O4 Dumbbells: Probing Morphology-Catalytic Activity Effects in O-2 Reduction Catalysis								ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS				30	25					2002633	10.1002/adfm.202002633		APR 2020		JUN 18 2020	2020	The design and synthesis of faceted nanoparticles with a controlled composition is of enormous importance to modern catalyst engineering. Faceted FePt-Fe3O4 dumbbell nanoparticles are prepared by a simple, one-pot technique that avoids the need for expensive additives or preformed seeds. The faceted product consists of an FePt octopod and a cubic Fe3O4 lobe, of mean diameter 13.6 and 14.9 nm, respectively. The mass normalized activity for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction shows that this new structure types outperforms related catalysts in alkaline media. This work illustrates the power of morphology control and tailoring crystal facet abundance at the nanoparticle surface for enhancing catalytic performance.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000528588700001		
J	Bhowmik, Tanmay; Kundu, Manas Kumar; Barman, Sudip					Barman, Sudip/0000-0002-4285-9417			Palladium Nanoparticle-Graphitic Carbon Nitride Porous Synergistic Catalyst for Hydrogen Evolution/Oxidation Reactions over a Broad Range of pH and Correlation of Its Catalytic Activity with Measured Hydrogen Binding Energy								ACS CATALYSIS				6	3			1929	1941		10.1021/acscatal.5b02485				MAR 2016	2016	The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in aqueous medium are two fundamental reactions for the development of non-fossil energy storage and conversion devices. In the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) carbon supported platinum (Pt/C) based catalysts are universally used in cathodes and anodes; however, the poor durability of Pt/C due to degradation of the catalyst in the strongly oxidizing environment prevents its widespread applications. It remains a great challenge to develop new electrocatalysts with superior activity and very high durability for the HER/HOR. Here, we report the synthesis of a porous palladium nanoparticle- carbon nitride composite (Pd-CNx) for its superior activity and high durability toward the HER/HOR in acidic and alkaline media. The Pd-CNx composites exhibited high catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution in acidic media with a small onset potential of -12 mV and a Tafel slope of 35 mV dec(-1). At a small Pd loading of 0.043 mg cm(-2), this catalyst also exhibits a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of -55 mV with an excellent stability. The HER activity on Pd-CNx composite is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C in acid media. The stability tests of this catalyst were done through a large number of repeated potential cycles and long-term electrolysis. These confirm the exceptional durability of this catalyst, which is much better than that of Pt/C catalysts. Furthermore, this catalyst has also displayed superior HOR activity, measured by a rotating-disk experiment with a broad range of pH (0-14) in different buffer solutions. The HER/HOR activities of porous Pd-CNx composite in different buffer solutions were correlated with the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) of the catalyst surface. The HER/HOR activity gradually decreases with an increase in the HBE as the solution pH increases. The superior HER/HOR activities and very high durability at porous Pd-CNx composite are due to strong bonding between Pd and carbon (Pd-C bond), the porous morphology, and synergistic interactions between Pd-NPs and the carbon nitride (CNx) support.									202	11	0	0	9	0	205			2155-5435			WOS:000371755500064

Herein, a low-cost, simple, and easy-to-scale method to develop sustainable and cost-effective ORR carbocatalysts via impregnation followed by pyrolysis of different renewable woody biomass is reported. Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption near edge structure measurements show that the nitrogen- and phosphorus-promoted atomically dispersed iron is mainly responsible for the high ORR activity. Moreover, by a mimic of the natural pine materials derived Fe-based electrocatalyst, introducing external Fe precursor into the biomass can generate targeted well dispersed Fe complex catalysts, which is not very much dependent on the biomass types. The insights revealed here can shed new light on the development of sustainable and cost-effective ORR carbocatalysts from biomass.									15	2	0	0	1	0	15			2196-7350			WOS:000459485500005

However, current doping approaches are complicated, not eco-friendly, and not cost-effective. Herein, we report the synthesis of doped/decorated rGO for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) using a simple approach that is cost-effective, sustainable, and easy to scale up. The OER catalyst was derived from the reduction of GO by an exo-electron-transferring bacterium, Geobacter sulfurreducens. Various analytical tools indicate that OER active elements such as Fe, Cu, N, P, and S decorate the rGO flakes. The hybrid catalyst (i.e., Geobacter/rGO) produces a geometric current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 270 mV versus the reversible hydrogen electrode with a Tafel slope of 43 mV dec(-1) and possesses high durability, as evidenced through 10 h of stability testing. Electrochemical analyses suggest the importance of Fe and its possible role as an active site for OER Overall, this work represents a simple approach toward the development of an earth abundant, eco-friendly, and highly active OER electrocatalyst for various applications such as solar fuel production, rechargeable metal-air batteries, and microbial electrosynthesis.									29	2	0	0	7	0	29			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000470035000010

Insight into the mechanism and kinetics of light-driven biphasic hydrogen evolution are obtained by analysis with gas chromatography, cyclic voltammetry, and UV/Vis and H-1 NMR spectroscopy. Formation of decamethylosmocenium hydride, which occurs prior to hydrogen evolution, is a rapid step relative to hydrogen release and takes place independently of light activation. Remarkably, hydride formation occurs with greater efficiency (ca. 90% conversion) under biphasic conditions than when the reaction is carried out in an acidified single organic phase (ca. 20% conversion). Cyclic voltammetry studies reveal that decamethylosmocene has a higher proton affinity than either decamethylferrocene or osmocene.									29	0	0	0	0	0	29			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000322236400040	23687064

The photocatalytic oxygen evolution activity for BiZn2VO6 was largely increased by chemical etching with H2SO4, accompanied by formation of a lot of pleats or furrows at the surface. Consideration of the specific surface area has indicated that the activity for BiZn2VO6 lies in the highest class ever reported and is much higher than that for BiVO4, which is known as one of the most active photocatalysts.

ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS				30	47	SI				1909005	10.1002/adfm.201909005		FEB 2020		NOV 2020	2020	Tuning and tailoring of surface terminating functional species hold the key to unlock unprecedented properties for a wide range of applications of the largest 2D family known as MXenes. However, a few routes for surface tailoring are explored and little is known about the extent to which the terminating species can saturate the MXene surfaces. Among available terminations, atomic oxygen is of interest for electrochemical energy storage, hydrogen evolution reaction, photocatalysis, etc. However, controlled oxidation of the surfaces is not trivial due to the favored formation of oxides. In the present contribution, single sheets of Ti3C2Tx MXene, inherently terminated by F and O, are defluorinated by heating in vacuum and subsequentially exposed to O-2 gas at temperatures up to 450 degrees C in situ, in an environmental transmission electron microscope. Results include exclusive termination by O on the MXene surfaces and eventual supersaturation (x > 2) with a retained MXene sheet structure. Upon extended O exposure, the MXene structure transforms into TiO2 and desorbs surface bound H2O and CO2 reaction products. These results are fundamental for understanding the oxidation, the presence of water on MXene surfaces, and the degradation of MXenes, and pave way for further tailoring of MXene surfaces.									48	0	0	0	2	0	48			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000513995700001

However, conventional approaches for the synthesis of N-HCS always involved multistep procedures. In this paper, by appropriately controlling the polymerization oft etraethoxysilane (TEOS) and resorcinol/formaldehyde (RF), N-HCS have been synthesized through "one pot" method without use of surfactant. Next, the ORR and OER of N-HCS were conducted to examine its electrocatalytic ability. Finally, it was modified on the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) as an improved electrical catalyst to monitor H2O2 in human serum samples. The linear ranges for monitoring H2O2 were from 0.05 mM to 29.5 mM and from 29.5 mM to 47.5 mM with a limit of detection of 0.02 mM. The recoveries for the assays in human serums were between 92.5% and 107.4%. Therefore, we believe that this newly synthesized N-HCS will play a significant role in the synthesis and application of electrocatalytic materials and the development of novel electrochemical sensors.									28	0	0	0	5	0	28			0925-4005			WOS:000434011500064

Herein, NiOOH@cobalt copper carbonate hydroxide (NiOOH@CoCu CH) nanorods were designed for highly efficient water and hydrazine oxidation. Compared with NiOOH and CoCu CH directly grown on nickel foam, NiOOH@CoCu CH demonstrates enhanced electrocatalytic activities toward the OER and HzOR. To achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the required potentials for the OER and HzOR are 1.49 V and -0.031 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively. Also, it just needs an overpotential of -171 mV to acquire a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process. By assembling a two-electrode electrolyzer using NiOOH@CoCu CH as both the anode and cathode in an alkaline electrolyte with hydrazine, a rather low cell voltage of 0.087 V is required to realize a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This value is far smaller than that of 1.56 V required in pure KOH electrolyte, suggesting a more energy-saving approach for efficient hydrogen production. Moreover, NiOOH@CoCu CH also demonstrates excellent long-term operation stability during continuous OER, HER and HzOR processes. All these merits corroborate the promising practical applications of such non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts for large scale hydrogen production through water electrolysis with the assistance of the hydrazine oxidation reaction.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000777691900001

However, the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires a large energy input. Low-cost, transition metals such as NiFe oxides/hydroxides have been regarded as one of the most efficient catalysts for the OER in alkaline media, although the detailed mechanisms remain debated due to the lack of direct evidence for the proposed active sites during the catalytic processes. Herein, we show a NiFe (oxy)hydroxide catalyst doped with a third metal Cr prepared by facile electrodeposition to achieve further enhanced activity for the OER. Operando Raman and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) characterisation were employed to detect the formation of active intermediates and M-O bonds on active sites during the OER process. For the host NiFe (oxy)hydroxide catalyst, the shorter Fe-O in the Fe-substituted-beta-NiOOH intermediate is observed as active sites for the OER. A Cr, Fe-substituted-beta-NiOOH intermediate is detected in the enhanced NiFeCr (oxy)hydroxide catalyst where Cr is oxidized into the 6+ valence state with optimal Cr-O bonds, adding new active sites to boost the OER. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the operando spectroscopic observations and reveal the lower overpotential at the Cr6+ sites in the NiFeCr oxyhydroxide intermediate than the Fe3+ sites in the NiFe oxyhydroxide intermediate. This study demonstrates a strategy for designing highly active OER catalysts by introducing high valence metals into oxides/hydroxides to further enhance the kinetics of water oxidation.									86	6	0	0	6	0	86			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000589801000019

This was accompanied by the reduction of water, and the quantitative yield of hydrogen evolution was much higher than the chemical equivalent of hydrogen gas. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy and quenching experiments demonstrated that hydroxyl free radicals, originating from water splitting, promoted the oxidation of arylalcohols, while the holes in the valence band of the photocatalyst were reduced by the -OH and organic substrates. The overall reaction generates high-value-added organics. This photocatalytic reaction is atom-economical, in accordance with the concept of sustainable development.									28	1	0	0	1	0	28			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000435868200005

Photocatalysis and electrocatalysis play important roles in these fields. They can decompose and remove organic pollutants from the aqueous environment, and prepare some fine chemicals. Moreover, they also can carry out some important reactions, such as O-2 reduction reaction (ORR), O-2 evolution reaction (OER), H-2 evolution reaction (HER), CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), and N-2 fixation (NRR). For catalytic reactions, it is the key to develop high-performance catalysts to meet the demand for targeted reactions. In recent years, two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted great interest in environmental catalysis due to their unique layered structures, which offer us to make use of their electronic and structural characteristics. Great progress has been made so far, including graphene, black phosphorus, oxides, layered double hydroxides (LDHs), chalcogenides, bismuth-based layered compounds, MXenes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and others. This content drives us to invite many famous groups in these fields to write the roadmap on two-dimensional nanomaterials for environmental catalysis. We hope that this roadmap can give the useful guidance to researchers in future researches, and provide the research directions.

J	Ma, Guangyu; Du, Xiaoqiang; Zhang, Xiaoshuang								Facile synthesis of molybdenum-based layered double hydroxide nanorods for boosting water oxidation reaction								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				45	58			33641	33647		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.09.097				NOV 27 2020	2020	Exploiting environmentally friendly and robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrodes is still a great difficulty to promote the water oxidation for electrocatalytic water splitting. In the work, molybdenum-doped nickel copper hydrotalcite (NiCuMox LDH) nanoarrays have been firstly in situ grown on nickel foam (NF) via a typical hydrothermal process. When NiCuMo0.2 LDH/NF was used as a OER electrocatalyst, it displays superior electrocatalytic performance with the need of small overpotentials of only 290 mV to drive 40 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 39.8mVdec(-1), which are almost one of the best water oxidationactivities reported so far. The enhanced electrocatalytic performance is attributed to unique urchin-like structure, more exposure to active sites and enhanced charge transfer rate owing to the synergistic effect of Mo doping and NiCu LDH. The work put forward a new method for the development of efficient water oxidation electrocatalysts, which will fill the gap for the exploitation of trimetal LDH-based electrodes in large-scale water splitting applications in the future.

J	Zhang, Yangping; Li, Zhuolin; Zhang, Kewang; Wu, Zhengying; Gao, Fei; Du, Yukou								Heterogeneous interface engineering for boosting electron transfer induced by MOF-derived Yolk-shell trimetallic phosphide nanospindles for robust water oxidation electrocatalysis								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				590						153102	10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.153102				JUL 15 2022	2022	The heterogeneous interface engineering of nanocatalysts has been proved as an efficient strategy to promote the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance. Different from the conventional hollow structures, the yolk-shell construction could defend the distortion and dissolution during OER for stability improvement. However, it is still a great challenging to simultaneously construct heterogeneous interface and yolk-shell structure based on electrocatalysts with well-tuned composition and structure. Herein, we developed a facile synthetic method to prepare the yolk-shell trimetallic phosphide catalysts by starting with MIL-88A nanospindles templates. Benefitting from heterogeneous interface with fast electron transfer, yolk-shell architecture with rich channels for mass transportation, and active metal doping with electron structure modulation, the obtained CoNiFeP yolk-shell nanospindles (YSNSs) catalysts displayed superior OER catalytic properties with the over potential of only 261 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media. Furthermore, the yolk shell architecture endowed CoNiFeP with remarkable OER stability for 60 h. By coupling CoNiFeP with Pt/C electrodes to drive overall water splitting, an ultralow cell voltage of 1.56 V is required. The experimental and mechanistic studies indicated the optimized binding energy of *OOHad and *OHad intermediates by constructing robust phosphide interface.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000790010500004

Since they have exhausted all of their nuclear fuel, their evolution is just a gravothermal process. The release of energy only depends on the detailed internal structure and chemical composition and on the properties of the envelope equation of state and opacity; its consequences on the cooling curve (i.e., the luminosity vs. time relationship) depend on the luminosity at which this energy is released.The internal chemical profile depends on the rate of the C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16 reaction as well as on the treatment of convection. High reaction rates produce white dwarfs with oxygen-rich cores surrounded by carbon-rich mantles. This reduces the available gravothermal energy and decreases the lifetime of white dwarfs.In this paper we compute detailed evolutionary models providing chemical profiles for white dwarfs having progenitors in the mass range from 1.0 to 7 M., and we examine the influence of such profiles in the cooling process. The influence of the process of separation of carbon and oxygen during crystallization is decreased as a consequence of the initial stratification, but it is still important and cannot be neglected. As an example, the best fit to the luminosity functions of Liebert et al. and Oswalt et al. gives an age of the disk of 9.3 and 11.0 Gyr, respectively, when this effect is taken into account, and only 8.3 and 10.0 Gyr when it is neglected.									165	0	0	0	1	0	165			0004-637X			WOS:A1997XT96800038

Herein, we report a copper phthalocyanine based 2D conjugated MOF with square-planar cobalt bis(dihydroxy) complexes (Co-O-4) as linkages (PcCu-O-8-Co) and layer-stacked structures prepared via solvothermal synthesis. PcCu-O-8-Co 2D MOF mixed with carbon nanotubes exhibits excellent electrocatalytic ORR activity (E-1/2=0.83 V vs. RHE, n=3.93, and j(L)=5.3 mA cm(-2)) in alkaline media, which is the record value among the reported intrinsic MOF electrocatalysts. Supported by in situ Raman spectro-electrochemistry and theoretical modeling as well as contrast catalytic tests, we identified the cobalt nodes as ORR active sites. Furthermore, when employed as a cathode electrocatalyst for zinc-air batteries, PcCu-O-8-Co delivers a maximum power density of 94 mW cm(-2), outperforming the state-of-the-art Pt/C electrocatalysts (78.3 mW cm(-2)).									192	16	0	0	8	0	192			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000474083100001	31169942

The Co9S8 within the hollow Co9S8@N-C microtubes presents a well-defined single-crystal structure with dominated (022) plane. To obtain desired electrocatalyst, the annealing temperature and the thickness of carbon layer tuned by changing the dopamine concentration are optimized systematically. The electrochemical results demonstrate that the coordination of the N-doped carbon layer, exposed (022) plane, and hollow architecture of Co9S8 microtubes calcined at 700 degrees C affords outstanding ORR. performance to Co9S8@N-C microtubes. The moderate thickness of the carbon layer is crucial for improving ORR activity of Co9S8@N-C microtubes, while increasing or decreasing the thickness would result in activity decrease. More importantly, the N-doped carbon layer can protect inner Co9S8 from undergoing aggregation and dissolution effectively during the ORR, resulting in excellent electrocatalytic stability.									77	1	0	0	2	0	77			1944-8244			WOS:000440956000051	29979562

Herein, we show that the B-doping-induced amorphization of crystalline layered double hydroxide (LDH) activates it as an extremely efficient HER catalyst. The amorphous B-incorporated nickel-cobalt LDH supported on the nickel foam (A-NiCo LDH/NF) can yield large current densities at small overpotentials (100 mA cm(-2) at 151 mV, 500 mA cm(-2) at 286 mV, and 1000 mA cm(-2) at 381 mV) with high durability in alkaline medium even after 72 h, which is even better than commercial platinum. This work may provide a promising way for structure tuning of transition metal LDH to effectively boost HER efficiency towards practical water electrolysis.									114	9	0	0	9	0	116			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000496897000024

Herein, we have synthesized andstructurally characterized a {Bi(OH2)2}3+-functionalized Kegginpolyoxometalate (POM) compound, K5[Bi(H2O)2SiW11O39]middot13H2O(K51middot13H2O). Keeping in mind that the {Bi(OH2)2}3+species on the surface of the POM has the potential to act as anactive site for electrocatalytic water oxidation, we encapsulated thefunctionalized Keggin POM anion [Bi(OH2)2SiW11O39]5-insidethe cavities of a well-known zeolitic-type framework material ZIF-8, a zinc imidazole-containing metal-organic framework, becausecompoundK51middot13H2Oper seis water-soluble and unstable in theoxidation window of water oxidation. The resulting host-guest-type composite material H5[Bi(H2O)2SiW11O39]@ZIF8 (H51@ZIF8) functions as an efficient electrocatalyst for water oxidation.Detailed electrochemical analyses have established that the title OER catalyst,H51@ZIF8, works in a wide pH window, ranging fromalkaline pH 13.0 to neutral pH 7.0 through an acidic pH 4.0. Diverse controlled experiments have been performed to infer that thebismuth-aqua complex is the functional site responding to the OER, with a catalytic turnover frequency of 1.24, 5.90, and 0.93 s-1of pH 13.0, pH 7.0, and pH 4.0 solutions, respectively, at the respective overpotentials of 375.0 mV [vsthe reversible hydrogenelectrode (RHE)], 585.21 mV (vsthe RHE), and 830.10 mV (vsthe RHE).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000795962300004

To utilize Iow-cost and high-efficiency polysulfides with industry-relevant cycling stability, we develop a Ni-rich NiSx/Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH catalyst derived from NiS2/Ni3S4 nanocubes. Ni-rich NiSx/Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH shows improved OER catalytic activity (n = 374 mV@50 mA cm(-2)) and stability (0.1% voltage increase) after 65 h of a galvanostatic test at 10 mA cm(-2) compared with commercial Ni/NiO and hydrothermally synthesized Ni(OH)(2) (both show eta > 460 mV@50 mA cm(-2) along with 4.40 and 1.92% voltage increase, respectively). A water-splitting electrolyzer based on Pt/C parallel to AF1-HNN8-50 parallel to NiSx/Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH exhibits a current density of 1800 mA cm(-2) at 2.0 V and 500 h high-rate stability at 1000 mA cm(-2) with negligible attenuation of only 0.12 mV h(-1). This work provides an understanding of truly stable species, intrinsic active phases of Ni polysulfides, their high-rate stability in a real cell, and sheds light on the development of stable chalcogenide-based anodic electrocatalysts for anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE).									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000812960400001	35452215

Here, CeO2 nanorods composites loaded with amorphous Fe(OH)(3) cocatalyst were designed and prepared via a secondary water bath at 100 degrees C. The as-synthesized CeO2/amorphous Fe(OH)(3) composites exhibited superior light photocatalytic activities compared to pure CeO2, especially the sample with a loading time of 60 min. The photocatalytic oxygen generation rate could reach to 357.2 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), and the average apparent quantum yield (AQY) was 24.67%, which was a 5.5-fold increase compared to the CeO2 sample. The improvement of photocatalytic performance could be ascribed to three main reasons: First, loading the amorphous Fe(OH)(3) enlarged the specific surface area and passivated the surface of the pristine CeO2. Second, the amorphous Fe(OH)(3), which acted as a cocatalyst, provided many active sites, and reduced the reaction activation energy. Thirdly, the maximum interface with intimate contact between CeO2 and amorphous Fe(OH)(3) cocatalyst accelerated the photogenerated charge separation efficiency and thus improved the photocatalytic performance of CeO2 in photocatalytic water oxidation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000675343200001	34227731

In this work, amorphous NiFe-based porous nanocubes (Ni-Fe-O-P, Ni-Fe-O-B, and Ni-Fe-O-S) are successfully synthesized via simple and cost-effective one-step calcination of Ni-Fe based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and heteroatom containing molecules. The resulting three materials maintain a well-defined porous nanocube morphology with heteroatoms uniformly distributed in the structure. The unique porous structure can effectively provide more active sites and shorten the mass transport distance. Additionally, the introduction of P, B or S can tune the electronic structure, which is favorable for accelerating the charge transfer, and may lead to the formation of the higher average oxidative valence of Ni species during the OER process. Benefiting from the above desirable properties, all three materials exhibit excellent OER electrocatalytic activities and outstanding long-term stability in a home-made zinc air battery. This work not only provides a general approach for the synthesis of highly efficient electrocatalysts based on earth-abundant elements but also highlights the potential prospects of MOFs in energy conversion and storage devices.									74	3	0	0	2	0	74			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000431003600038

We systematically varied the composition of the PBCO deposited by spin-coating using different Ba to Pr ratios. The influence of Pr-content in the perovskite on catalytic OER activity is discussed for two different substrates, namely platinized Si and laser polished Ti. The crystallographic structure of the thin films and the oxidation state of the metal ions in the perovskite is examined by XRD and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. In addition, we propose a laser-polishing process of the Ti substrates as alternative to the classical surface treatment, providing smooth and homogeneous surfaces. Accelerated life time tests have shown the advantage of the catalytically active films deposited on laser polished Ti substrates. (C) 2015 The Electrochemical Society.

Thanks to the unique characteristics of perovskite oxides, which include low cost, tunable electronic structure and cation deficiency, high electronic conductivity, high durability, high specific catalytic activity, and environmental friendliness, they have been widely designed and employed as the OER electrocatalysts. Here, a set of novel hybrid perovskites, LaxSr4-xNiyFe3-yO10-delta (LxS4-xNyF3-y), were demonstrated, which consist of a single -layer perovskite phase (P phase) and two Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite phases (RP phases). These hybrid pe-rovskites synergize the advantages of the P phase and RP phases, which improves the oxygen-ion diffusion rate, leading to enhanced OER activity. Furthermore, the concentration of each phase can be tuned by alternating the compositional stoichiometry. A relatively uniform distribution of the P phase and RP phases can maximize the interfacial area and achieve the highest oxygen-ion diffusion rate. L3S1N2F1, L2S2N1F2, and L2S2N1.5F1.5 exhibit outstanding OER activity, which achieve 10 mA/cm2 at a low overpotential of less than 360 mV in 1.0 M KOH. Additionally, herein, the hybrid perovskites are implemented as the anodes of AEMWEs, which deliver an exceptional current density of > 1.0 A/cm2 at 1.8 V.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000863330400001

The DGNSs are vertically aligned on the crystal facets of the BDD films uniformly, densely, and orderly. The DGNSs are composed of the core diamond sheets and the surface graphitic overlayers, which possess an open edge structure. By posttreatment in NH3 atmosphere in a microwave plasma or a tube furnace, the N-doped DGNSs (NDGNSs) were obtained. The electrocatalytic performance toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for the DGNSs was greatly enhanced after doping with N, and the doped pyridinic N contributes more to the ORR The electrocatalytic activity for ORR of the NDGNSs doped at 650 degrees C in NH3 in a tube furnace is the highest in all of the samples, which is comparable to the commercial Pt/C. The present work provides a novel electrocatalyst for the ORR with high performance.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000444355700070	30085645	
J	Ma, Baojun; Zhang, Jiawei; Lin, Keying; Li, Dekang; Liu, Yahui; Yang, Xu								Improved Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution of CdS Using Earth-Abundant Cocatalyst Mo2N with Rod Shape and Large Capacitance								ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING				7	15			13569	13575		10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b03334				AUG 5 2019	2019	Earth-abundant catalysts (cocatalysts) for photocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis, and electrocatalysis have attracted increased attention due to the potentially reduced cost for large-scale application. Here, we first report and demonstrate that improving the capacitance of cocatalysts of Mo2N by modifying the morphology and orientations could produce a better photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity on CdS. Among rod, sheet, and sphere shapes of Mo2N, the (111)-orientated rod h-Mo2N was found to be the most efficient. The hydrogen evolution activity of h-Mo2N/CdS is 6.1 times that of the Pt/CdS and 30.1 times that of the bare CdS. A controlling experiment showed that the superior photocatalytic HER activity can be attributed to the higher capacitance of h-Mo2N. This study opens up a pathway to develop novel cocatalysts for photocatalyst by adjusting the capacitance through morphology controls.									25	1	0	0	0	0	25			2168-0485			WOS:000480370500101

Herein, we report self-supported highly porous nitrogen-doped graphene foam synthesized through the electrochemical expansion of carbon-fiber paper and subsequent nitrogen plasma treatment. A thorough characterization, such as electron microscopy and synchrotron-based near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure, indicates the well-developed porous structures featuring homogeneously doped nitrogen heteroatoms. These merits ensure enriched active sites, an enlarged active surface area, and improved mass/electron transport within the continuous graphene framework, thus leading to an outstanding capability toward electrocatalyzing OER in alkaline media, even competitive with the stateof-the-art noble-/transition-metal and nonmetal electrocatalysts reported to date, from the perspectives of the sharp onset potential, a small Tafel slope, and remarkable durability. Furthermore, a rechargeable Zn air battery with this self-supported electrocatalyst directly used as the air cathode renders a low charge/discharge overpotential and considerable life span. The finding herein suggests that a rational methodology to synthesize graphene-based materials can significantly enhance the oxygen electrocatalysis, thereby promoting the overall performance of the energy-related system.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000417669300037	29115135

Catalysts derived from Fe-doped ZIF-8 could in theory be as active as Pt/C thanks to the high intrinsic activity of FeN4; however, the micropores fail to meet rapid mass transfer. Herein, an ordered hierarchical porous structure is introduced into Fe-doped ZIF-8 single crystals, which were subsequently carbonized to obtain an FeN4-doped hierarchical ordered porous carbon (FeN4/HOPC) skeleton. The optimal catalyst FeN4/HOPC-c-1000 shows excellent performance with a half-wave potential of 0.80 V in 0.5 m H2SO4 solution, only 20 mV lower than that of commercial Pt/C (0.82 V). In a real PEMFC, FeN4/HOPC-c-1000 exhibits significantly enhanced current density and power density relative to FeN4/C, which does not have an optimized pore structure, implying an efficient utilization of the active sites and enhanced mass transfer to promote the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).									222	25	0	0	11	0	227			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000509625200001	31769154

In this work, near ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAPXPS) is employed to investigate the chemical properties and the catalytic role of indium/copper model catalysts under CO2 hydrogenation conditions. We found that the deposition of In on the surface of a Cu foil led to the formation of Cu-In alloy, whereas upon CO2 exposure, In was partially oxidized to In2O3-x and Cu remains metallic. Due to the presence of In2O3-x, CO2 was activated on the surface of In/Cu samples mainly in the form of carbonate. In addition, compared with the pure In foil reference, both the fraction of oxygen vacancies and the coverage density of carbonate were higher on the In/Cu samples, indicating the promotion effect of Cu-In alloy in the activation of CO2. These results reveal the evolution of the active sites of indium/copper catalysts and inspire the design of advanced In-based bimetallic catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation. (C) 2021 The Authors.

We have been investigated the mechanism of blister formation on the PECVD SiO2/Pt/PZT/Pt capacitor. The blisters were observed at the temperature of 325 degreesC in O-2 atmosphere, while in N-2 and Ar atmosphere blisters were not formed even at 500 degreesC. Hydrogen evolution analysis from the PECVD SiO2 layer showed a sharp peak near 320 degreesC. The results indicated that the accumulation of water-vapor pressure developed by chemical reaction between oxygen and hydrogen could be the dominant mechanism of blister formation in PECVD SiO2/Pt/PZT/Pt capacitors.

A stable semi-transparent ITO/Au/ITO hole conducting oxide layer, sandwiched between the OER catalyst and the Si photoanode, is used to protect the Si from corrosion in an alkaline working environment, enhance the hole transportation, and provide a preactivation contact to the NiOx catalyst. The NiOx catalyzed Si photoanode generates a photocurrent of 1.98 mA cm-2 at the equilibrium water oxidation potential (EOER = 0.415 V vs. NHE in 1 M NaOH solution). A thermodynamic solar-to-oxygen conversion efficiency (SOCE) of 0.07% under 0.51-sun illumination is observed. The successful development of a low cost, highly efficient, and stable photoelectrochemical electrode based on earth abundant elements is essential for the realization of a large-scale practical solar fuel conversion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076			INSPEC:14800785

Conventional pyrolysis of selected precursors for SACs requires well-controlled pyrolysis conditions, and currently, it is still a critical challenge to establish a versatile strategy for preparing well-defined SACs. Herein, we demonstrate a facile mechanochemical-induced self-sustaining reaction to fabricate Co SACs supported by nitrogen-doped carbon via direct milling of cobalt (II) 5,10,15,20-tetrakis-(4 & PRIME;-bromophenyl)porphyrin (Co-TPPBr) with calcium carbide. The as-prepared ball-milling sample (BM) Co-BM-C can be directly obtained without the utilization of pre-prepared carbon support or further pyrolysis procedure. Furthermore, the obtained Co-BM C shows both excellent performance for oxygen evolution (240 mV overpotential@10 mA cm-2) and hydrogen evolution (126 mV overpotential @10 mA cm(-2)) in 1 M KOH, exhibiting great potential as the water-splitting electrocatalyst (1.60 V@10 mA cm(-2)). Therefore, the present study not only proposes new insights on preparing SACs but also provides new opportunities for water-splitting devices.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000780379600002

When used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions from water splitting in an alkaline solution, the electrode exhibits excellent activity and stability outperforming noble mental-based Pt/C, IrO2, and reported non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the excellent performance is attributable to the improved charge-transfer characteristics of the S:CoP nanoparticles owing to their modified electronic structure. It also increases the number of exposed active sites especially on the conductive substrates. A bifunctional S:CoP catalyst-based alkaline electrolyzer for overall water splitting exhibits a stable current density of 100 mA/cm(2) at an overvoltage of 0.55 V during a long-term operation; this performance is superior to that obtained from all-noble metal electrolyzer with a Pt/C cathode and an IrO2 anode.									130	4	0	0	11	0	131			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000448994600035

However, catalytic anisotropy, particularly the poor catalytic capability of the van der Waals forces contained in stack edge planes, has suppressed the enhancement of LOB performance as 2D cathode catalysts. Here, an ion-intercalation strategy is proposed to diminish the catalytic anisotropy of 2D materials. Ag ions are successfully intercalated into SnSe2 layered structure and regulate the electronic states between stack edge planes, leading to an improvement in the catalytic capability of 2D SnSe2. Notably, the catalytic capability of the 2D surface (001) plane of SnSe2 is also significantly enhanced after Ag intercalation, which can efficiently accelerate charge transfer and suppress the passivation on the 2D surface plane during the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction process. As a consequence, the Ag-intercalated SnSe2 cathode exhibits superior specific capacity of 16871 mAh g(-1) and an ultrastable cycle life over 2300 h at a current density of 100 mA g(-1) and 144 cycles at current density of 1000 mA g(-1). This work provides insights into the modulation of the catalytic capabilities of 2D materials, which have significant potential for this application in LOBs.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000806729500001

Herein, RuCo alloy nanoparticles uniformly anchoring on oxidized carbon nanotube architectures (RuCo-OCA) have been constructed via ozonation, freeze-drying and thermal activation methods. RuCo-OCA exhibits excellent catalytic HER and OER performance. To reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), RuCo-OCA requires low overpotential of 42 and 258 mV for HER and OER with the Tafel slope of 32.8 and 65.9 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH, respectively. Meanwhile, RuCo-OCA shows negligible change of current density after chronoamperometry test for 10 h with low charge transfer resistance of 15.9 and 96 omega for HER and OER. Furthermore, the symmetric RuCu-OCA||RuCu-OCA electrolyzer shows superior water-spitting performance to Pt/C/||RuO2 electrolyzer with a potential of 1.56 V at 10 mA cm(-2). The excellent electrocatalytic performance of RuCo-OCA can be attributed to the hierarchical structure of oxidized CNT aerogel for the improved reaction kinetics and the formation of RuCo alloys with the modified electronic structure and adsorbability of intermediates. Meanwhile, the boosted active sites have been probed by density function theory. The coupling of RuCo alloys with conductive oxidized CNT aerogel can provide a new strategy to further expedite the electrocatalytic efficiency and activity of catalysts for water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000862699500004

Oxygen vacancies on the surface are determined to be able to significantly affect the behavior of H by modifying the charge of surface lattice O through the occurrence of Ce3+. It has been found that, at the reduced CeO2(111) surface, the adsorption strength of H as well as the H coupling barrier can be dramatically reduced compared to those at the stoichiometric surface, while H2O formation barrier is not significantly affected. Moreover, the diffusion of H at the reduced surface or into the bulk can occur more readily than that at stoichiometric CeO2(111).									63	1	0	0	5	0	63			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000348203200066	25536096

This is due to some worthwhile advantages over similar transition metal selenides and even the widely used MoS2. The layered structure of MoSe2 plus the size and electrical conductivity of Se provide a good opportunity for hosting counterions in electrochemical energy storage systems such as lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries. The unsaturated Se atoms at the edge and those at defective points or altered basal plane have superior electrocatalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and similar electrocatalytic reactions (e.g., in lithium-oxygen batteries). Furthermore, the tunable band gap of MoSe2 has made it a promising candidate for photocatalysis and photoelectrochemical solar cells. Since all these applications are somehow similar, this manuscript provides an overall perspective on the potentials of MoSe2 in a wide range of applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

They play a key role in promoting the catalytic reactions. However, development of low-cost and eco-friendly catalysts for water oxidation process is still challenging. Herein we show that the photocatalytic activity of BiVO4 can be greatly enhanced by compositing SiC micro-sized powder to form well-connected interfaces via crystal engineering method. The rate of photocatalytic oxygen evolution is doubled, leading to 659 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) observed in 1:1 (weight ratio) SiC/BiVO4 composites under visible-light irradiation, even though SiC itself is very passive in O-2 production. The apparent quantum efficiency reaches 1.04% at 420 nm. The transfer pathway of the photo-generated electrons between the composite is facilitated through a Z-scheme contact between BiVO4 and SiC, which is further evidenced by using H2PtCl6 photo-reduction as a molecular probe. Our method provides a simple and practical route to enhance and improve the catalytic activity for the existing catalysts by using low-cost and environmental-friendly non-metal materials.

Multicomponent reactive transport modelling was conducted to simulate the evolution of the contaminant plume chemistry under the influence of biogeochemical and inorganic reactions. Effective biodegradation rates by the various electron acceptors and the future potential for natural attenuation were estimated by matching the simulated concentrations of organic contaminants, electron acceptors, inorganic reaction products and pH to field-observed data. The modelling illustrates that some degradation processes (oxygen and nitrate reduction) are well constrained. However, a better understanding of reductive dissolution of Fe and Mn oxides, sulphate reduction and methanogenesis would improve predictions of future degradation at the site. An apparent mismatch between observed and simulated dissolved total inorganic carbon (TIC) concentrations may be explained by aerobic degradation of the contaminants in the unsaturated zone that occurred before the polluted water recharged into the saturated portion of the aquifer.					3rd International Conference on Groundwater Quality3rd International Conference on Groundwater Quality	JUN 18-21, 2001JUN 18-21, 2001	Univ Sheffield, Groundwater Protect & Restorat Grp; Univ Sheffield, Dept Civil & Struct Engn; Int Assoc Hydrol Sci, Int Commiss GroundwaterUniv Sheffield, Groundwater Protect & Restorat Grp; Univ Sheffield, Dept Civil & Struct Engn; Int Assoc Hydrol Sci, Int Commiss Groundwater	SHEFFIELD, ENGLANDSHEFFIELD, ENGLAND	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0144-7815		1-901502-86-4	WOS:000185215100071

In details, CoCl2 and glucose were used as cobalt and carbon precursors, respectively, and thiourea was utilized as sulfur and nitrogen precursors. This synthetic process involved three steps, including hand-milling, carbonation, and acid leaching. The results of characterization exhibited that the final products had mesoporous structures, which also showed high nitrogen and sulfur contents. Moreover, the Co9S8 nanoparticles dispersed evenly in the carbonaceous matrix. Furthermore, the calcining temperature could affect the porosities of the final products and the contents of the heteroatoms, which could further determine the electrocatalytic activities of these catalysts. When used as the electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction, the optimal catalyst, GTCo900, exhibited superior catalytic activities under acidic condition. The overpotential is 62 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, it could also reveal excellent stability for 12 h.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2192-6506			WOS:000493196600016	31943933

The unique 3D hierarchical architecture and potential synergies of Co3O4 and CoS provide benefits to the Co3O4/CoS heterostructure for both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER). It displays comparable ORR catalytic activity (half-wave potential of 0.820 V) to state-of-the-art Pt/C but better durability and methanol tolerance. The Co3O4/CoS electrocatalyst also shows high OER activity with a relatively low overpotential (349 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and small Tafel slope (66.6 mV dec(-1)), compared to those of commercial RuO2 (366 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 86.3 mV dec(-1), respectively), making it a potential bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the ORR and the OER. Moreover, a rechargeable Zn-air battery with a Co3O4/CoS cathode shows a higher cell voltage (1.51 V), higher power density (168 mW cm(-2) at 269 mA cm(-2)), and better cycling stability (up to 150 cycles) than the same battery with the state-of-the-art Pt/C + RuO2 catalyst. This PBA-based material with a strongly coupled interface between Co3O4 and CoS offers insights into the development of low-cost and highly efficient electrocatalysts for diverse energy-related applications.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000681296600001

In particular, the redox conditions of magma oceans may have profound influence on the redox state of subsequently formed mantles and the overlying atmospheres. The relevant redox buffering reactions, however, remain poorly constrained. Using first-principles simulations combined with thermodynamic modeling, we show that magma oceans of Earth, Mars, and the Moon are likely characterized with a vertical gradient in oxygen fugacity with deeper magma oceans invoking more oxidizing surface conditions. This redox zonation may be the major cause for the Earth's upper mantle being more oxidized than Mars' and the Moon's. These contrasting redox profiles also suggest that Earth's early atmosphere was dominated by CO2 and H2O, in contrast to those enriched in H2O and H-2 for Mars, and H-2 and CO for the Moon. Applying first-principles molecular dynamic simulations and thermodynamic modelling, the authors suggest a vertical oxygen fugacity gradient in magma oceans of Earth, Mars, and the Moon. Consequently, the study proposes larger planets like Earth to have stronger oxidized upper mantles than smaller bodies such as Mars or the Moon.									25	0	0	0	5	0	25			2041-1723			WOS:000558820800025	32332725

Impact of O-16(gamma, alpha)C-12 measurements on the C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16 astrophysical reaction rate								PHYSICAL REVIEW C				99	5					055802	10.1103/PhysRevC.99.055802				MAY 2 2019	2019	The C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16 reaction, an important component of stellar helium burning, plays a key role in nuclear astrophysics. It has direct impact on the evolution and final state of massive stars, while also influencing the elemental abundances resulting from nucleosynthesis in such stars. Providing a reliable estimate for the energy dependence of this reaction at stellar helium burning temperatures has been a major goal for the field. In this work, we study the role of potential new measurements of the inverse reaction, O-16(gamma, alpha)C-12, in reducing the overall uncertainty. A multilevel R-matrix analysis is used to make extrapolations of the astrophysical S factor for this reaction to the stellar energy of 300 keV. The statistical precision of the S-factor extrapolation is determined by performing multiple fits to existing E1 and E2 ground-state capture data, including the impact of possible future measurements of the O-16(gamma, alpha)C-12 reaction. In particular, we consider a proposed Jefferson Laboratory (JLab) experiment that will make use of a high-intensity low-energy bremsstrahlung beam that impinges on an oxygen-rich single-fluid bubble chamber in order to measure the total cross section for the inverse reaction. The importance of low-energy data as well as high-precision data is investigated.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2469-9985	2469-9993		WOS:000466610300002

This contribution addresses electrocatalytic properties of Ni-based catalysts in reactions of fuel oxidation in alkaline media. It first details the electrochemical behavior of Ni in alkaline media and approaches to determine the active surface area of Ni electrodes. Second, the electrocatalytic activities of Ni-based electrocatalysts for the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction are described (an endeavor for the development of anion exchange membrane fuel cells), along with a detailed analysis of the strategies put forward to improve them. It is notably shown that the state of Ni surface (oxidized or reduced) largely determines its electrocatalytic activity. This state of the surface also conveys a pivotal importance regarding the activity of Ni for the oxidation of complex fuels (borohydride, boranes, and hydrazine). Finally, emphasis is made on the durability of Ni-based catalysts in alkaline environments. It is shown that, in such media, the material durability of Ni-based electrodes can be high, but this does not necessarily warrant stable electrocatalytic activity, because of possible deactivation following surface oxide or bulk hydride formation in operation.									60	3	0	0	4	0	60			2155-5435			WOS:000547452800006

Identifying problems and developing solutions for these materials are vital for creating high-energy lithium-ion batteries. Herein, the electrochemical and structural monitoring is conducted on lithium-rich cathodes to directly probe the formation processes of larger voltage hysteresis. These results indicate that the charge-compensation properties, structural evolution, and transition metal (TM) ions migration vary from oxidation to reduction process. This leads to huge differences in charge and discharge voltage profile. Meanwhile, the anionic redox processes display a slow kinetics process with large hysteresis (approximate to 0.5 V), compared to fast cationic redox processes without any hysteresis. More importantly, a simple yet effective strategy has been proposed where fine-modulating local oxygen environment by the lithium/oxygen (Li/O) ratio tunes the anionic redox chemistry. This effectively improves its electrochemical properties, including the operating voltage and kinetics. This is also verified by theoretical calculations that adjusting anionic redox chemistry by the Li/O ratio shifts the TM 3d-O 2p bands and the non-bonding O 2p band to a lower energy level, resulting in a higher redox reaction potential.									28	1	0	0	0	0	28			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000573557400001

Fe is the second most abundant metal on the earth and is cheaper than Co or Ni, but Fe-rich catalysts still suffer from poor catalytic activity toward the OER. Herein, a novel Fe-rich nanoribbon catalyst ((Co,V)-FeOOH) was prepared by a primary battery powered strategy. (Co,V)-FeOOH shows ultralow overpotentials of 230 and 322 mV at current densities of 10 and 500 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, respectively. Systematic experiments and DFT calculations are performed to prove that the doped Co and V elements can synergistically optimize the electronic structure and free energy for adsorbed intermediates of FeOOH, thus leading to an enhanced OER activity of (Co,V)-FeOOH nanoribbons. This work shows that the low-cost Fe-rich OER catalyst prepared by an effective and economic method can be highly efficient and provides a possibility for the design of advanced OER electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2052-1537		WOS:000674761100001

The evolution of redox processes in groundwater is dependent on many factors such as the source and distribution of electron donors and acceptors in the aquifer, relative rates of redox reaction and groundwater flow, aquifer confinement, position in the flow system, and groundwater mixing. Redox gradients are largely vertical in the recharge areas of unconfined aquifers dominated by natural sources of electron donors, whereas substantial longitudinal redox gradients can develop in unconfined aquifers when anthropogenic sources of electron donors are dominant. Longitudinal redox gradients predominate in confined aquifers. Electron-donor limitations can result in the preservation of oxic groundwater over flow distances of many kilometers and groundwater residence, times of several thousand years in some aquifers. Where electron donors are abundant, redox conditions can evolve from oxygen reducing to methanogenic over substantially shorter flow distances and residence times.					239th National Meeting of the American-Chemical-Society239th National Meeting of the American-Chemical-Society	MAR 21-25, 2010MAR 21-25, 2010	Amer Chem Soc, Div Chem Educ; Amer Chem Soc, Div Carbohydrate Chem; Amer Chem Soc, Sustainable Theme Comm; Amer Sugar Cane League; V Lab Inc; Amer Chem SocAmer Chem Soc, Div Chem Educ; Amer Chem Soc, Div Carbohydrate Chem; Amer Chem Soc, Sustainable Theme Comm; Amer Sugar Cane League; V Lab Inc; Amer Chem Soc	San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA	16	0	0	0	8	0	16			0097-6156	1947-5918	978-0-8412-2652-4	WOS:000306257800026

Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) are promising and intriguing candidates for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as well as other energy conversion technologies. Here we present a facile sol-gel route aimed at synthesizing FeP nanocrystals embedded in N-doped carbon nanosheets (FeP/NCNSs). The obtained nanocomposite exhibits excellent hydrogen generation activity, achieving 10 mA cm(-2) at relatively low overpotential (114 mV) in acidic electrolyte (0.5 M H2SO4). In the respect of structural integrity, the N-doped carbon layer could protect the FeP nanocrystals from acidic degradation, thus endowing the hybrid with superior durability to the bare FeP nanoparticles during long-term operation. Furthermore, the as-synthesized electrocatalyst also exhibits high catalytic activity and remarkable cyclability in alkaline and even neutral electrolytes. More importantly, other TMP nanocrystals encapsulated in N-doped carbon nanosheets like Ni2P/NCNSs can be similarly fabricated through this synthetic strategy, which also presents excellent catalytic performance and comfortable cycling durability toward HER. Therefore, this research provides a feasible and further generic route for the design and construction of transition metal phosphides/carbonaceous nanohybrid matrixes to enhance the performance toward HER and even other energy conversion reactions when implemented as electrode materials.									37	5	0	0	1	0	37			2168-0485			WOS:000443924100055

Herein, non-metallic boron (B) doping strategy was used to prepare self-supported electrode (B-NiMoO4@NF) which possessed flower cluster structure and was rich in oxygen deficient, and the influence of different addition of NaBH4 on catalyst performance was also investigated. Experimental studies showed that with the increase of NaBH4 addition, the morphology and structure of NiMoO4 precursor changed from "cuboid to hollow tubular to porous tubular". At the same times, numerous oxygen defect sites were generated that further increased the catalytic specific surface area and exposed more catalytic active sites. The results of surface wettability test showed that the prepared B-NiMoO4@NF electrodes exhibited superhydrophilic and superaerophobic properties, and B-10-NiMoO4@NF electrode showed better HER catalytic performance than commercial Pt/C supported by nickel foam (Pt/C@NF). And it merely required an over-potential of 22.89 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and the low Tafel slope of 30.08 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH solution.

In this study, Ni2P, Co2P, and NiCoP yolk-shell structures were embedded in N- and P-doped carbon nanofibers (NPNFs) by controlling the heat-treatment procedure of the fiber precursors. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of the samples was tested. The formation process of phosphides introduced a large number of surface defects that act as active sites to improve H-2 evolution. NPNF embedding composite NiCoP particles exhibited better performance compared with Ni2P-NPNFs and Co2P-NPNF samples in acidic conditions. In the case of a molar ratio Ni : Co : P of 1 : 1 : 1, NiCoP-decorated NPNFs revealed the best HER performance, which is ascribed to the loading of NiCoP composite particles, which greatly increased the specific surface area. NiCoP-NPNFs exhibited overpotentials of 183 and 280 mV at current densities of 1 mA cm(-2) and 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, with a Tafel slope of 94.5 mV dec(-1).									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				1466-8033		WOS:000613496600015

The dehydration and dehydroxylation processes (60-450-degrees-C) fall into four stages, the temperatures of which are influenced by the transport phenomena. Firstly, the four water molecules not coordinated by Cu2+ cations are released, followed by release of the water molecules (in two steps) that are coordinated by Cu2+ cations. Then, dehydroxylation takes place which may partly overlap with the last stage of dehydration. Further heating of the fully anhydrous compound results in a release of small amounts of oxygen at approx. 490 and 520-degrees-C, accompanied by corresponding exotherms on the DTA curve. This suggests the formation of new crystalline phases such as alpha-UO2SO4, beta-UO2SO4 and UO3-x. Decomposition of the anhydrous compound (CuO.2UO3.2SO3 or CuO+2UO2SO4) is characterized by the evolution of SO3 (in two steps) and oxygen. Small exotherms at 655 and 688-degrees-C in argon and air, respectively, mark the onset of SO3 evolution and can be assigned to the formation of crystalline CuU3O10. The presence of oxygen, formed both in the course of the decomposition reaction and as a result of SO3 dissociation, causes the inhibitive influence of the oxygen content in the atmosphere over the sample on the course of decomposition.									4	0	0	0	1	0	5			0040-6031	1872-762X		WOS:A1992JP23500023

In this study, we investigate the physical and chemical conditions that control this nitrogen fractionation process. To this end, a new disk model was developed, in which the isotope-selective photodissociation of N-2 and isotope-exchange chemical reactions have been incorporated. Our model can successfully reproduce the observed HCN column density when the elemental abundances of gas-phase carbon and oxygen are depleted by two orders of magnitude relative to those in the interstellar medium and carbon is more abundant than oxygen ([C/O](elem) > 1). The isotope-selective photodissociation of N-2 is the dominant nitrogen fractionation process in our models. The observed (HCN)-N-14/(HCN)-N-15 ratio, which increases outwards, can also be reproduced by the model by assuming that the small dust grains in the atmosphere of the outer disk are depleted more than those in the inner disk. This is consistent with grain evolution models, according to which small dust grains are continuously replenished in the inner disk due to fragmentation of the large dust grains that radially drift from the outer disk.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000618780500001

The boron-doped Ni/Fe nano-chains were synthesised in a one step process at room temperature using NaBH4 as a reducing agent. The addition of boron reduced the magnetic moment of the intermediate synthesis products and produced nano-chains with a high specific surface area of 73.4 m(2) g(-1). The boron-doped Ni/Fe nano chains exhibited catalytic performance superior to state-of-the-art Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta, perovskite and RuO2 noble metal oxide catalysts. The mass normalized activity of the boron-doped Ni/Fe nano chains measured at an overpotential of 0.35 V was 64.0 A g(-1), with a Tafel slope of only 40 mV dec(-1). The excellent performance of the boron-doped Ni/Fe nano-chains can be attributed to the uniform elemental distribution and highly amorphous structure of the B-doped nano-chains. These results provide new insights into the effect of doping transition-metal based OER catalysts with non-metallic elements. The study demonstrates a facile approach to prepare transition metal nano-chains using magnetic field assisted chemical reduction method as cheap and highly active catalysts for electrochemical water oxidation.(C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Mahadevan, T. S.; Garofalini, S. H.								Dissociative chemisorption of water onto silica surfaces and formation of hydronium ions								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				112	5			1507	1515		10.1021/jp076936c				FEB 7 2008	2008	Molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulation of the adsorption of water molecules onto the vitreous silica surface was performed using a new dissociative water potential.(58) The simulations showed dissociative chemisorption of water molecules onto the silica surface, forming silanol (SiOH) groups at a concentration consistent with experimental data. Water penetration and silanol formation similar to 7-8 angstrom below the outermost oxygen are observed. Because of the dissociative nature of the water potential, formation of hydronium ions is allowed, and, whereas seldom observed in the simulations of bulk water, hydronium ions are formed during the reactions causing the formation of the silanols. The formation of hydronium ions has also been observed in ab initio calculations of water adsorption onto silica surfaces. The time evolution of the reactions involving hydronium ions in our MD simulations is similar to that observed in first-principles MD calculations. Hydronium ions offer a mechanism by which initially singly coordinated terminal oxygen (Si-O-) receives a H+ ion from a relatively distant chemisorbed H2O molecule via multiple H+ ion transfer; creating two SiOH sites.									142	1	0	0	5	0	142			1932-7447			WOS:000252814800032		
J	Shi, Yanlong; Feng, Xiaojuan; Guan, Haiyu; Zhang, Jiahua; Hu, Zhongai								Porous sunflower plate-like NiFe2O4/CoNi-S heterostructure as efficient electrocatalyst for overall water splitting								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				46	12			8557	8566		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.12.062		FEB 2021		FEB 16 2021	2021	Constructing high-efficient and nonprecious electrocatalysts is of primary importance for improving the efficiency of water splitting. Herein, a novel sunflower plate-like NiFe2O4/CoNi-S nanosheet heterostructure was fabricated via facile hydrothermal and electrodeposition methods. The as-fabricated NiFe2O4/CoNi-S heterostructure array exhibits remarkable bifunctional catalytic activity and stability toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. It presents a small overpotential of 219 mV and 149 mV for OER and HER, respectively, to produce a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). More significantly, when the obtained electrodes are used as both the cathode and anode in an electrolyzer, a voltage of 1.57 V is gained at 10 mA cm(-2), with superior stability for 72 h. Such outstanding properties are ascribed to: the 3D porous network structure, which exposes more active sites and accelerates mass transfer and gas bubble emission; the high conductivity of CoNi-S, which provides faster charge transport and thus promotes the electrocatalytic reaction of the composites; and the effective interface engineering between NiFe2O4 (excellent performance for OER) and CoNi-S (high activity for HER), which leads to a shorter transport pathway and thus expedites electron transfer. This work provides a new strategy for designing efficient and inexpensive electrocatalysts for water splitting. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Meanwhile, transitional metal oxides (TMOs) have stimulated more and more research attention because of their unique performance, holding broad prospects in expediting the tardy oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electrolyzing water. However, facile and highly efficient synthesis of TMOs to garner excellent electrocatalytic performance has by far remained difficult. Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) self-supported microstrip-like Co3O4 assembled from a tiny nanocube electrocatalyst, grown in situ on commercial Co foam (denoted as Co3O4/Co), is fabricated through a facile one-step hydrothermal synthesis method, where the sluggish anodic OER is replaced by a more thermodynamically oxidized hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) for assisting energy-saving hydrogen generation in alkaline media. The synthesized electrocatalyst shows appreciable HzOR performances, producing a current density of 200 mA cm(-2) at -32 mV and a Tafel slope of 53.43 mV dec(-1). Remarkably, an ultrasmall-cell voltage of merely 1 V is required to deliver 764 mA cm(-2) in a coupled electrode electrolyzer with excellent stability at room temperature, which is outperforming the precious metal catalyst system and the reported noble-metal-free electrocatalysts. Further, the Faradaic efficiency of the as-fabricated electrocatalyst is close to 100%. Considering the high electrocatalytic efficiency for the HzOR, the Co3O4/Co proves to be a kind of energy-saving electrocatalyst for the HzOR with great potential.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			2168-0485			WOS:000538339500023

Herein, we report the growth of CoNi2S4 nanoparticles with high mass loading (14.8 mg cm(-2)) on the surface of carbon cloth (CC) by a two-step hydrothermal sulfuration. The CoNi2S4/CC electrode has the holey characteristic containing rich active sites for electrolyte access, and shows a high areal capacitance of 10.87 C cm(-2) at 10 mA cm(-2) and a prominent coulombic efficiency. Furthermore, the as-assembled hybrid supercapacitor delivers a high areal capacitance of 3.16 F cm(-2), an energy density of 1.42 mWh cm(-2) at a power density of 9.0 mW cm(-2), and a high capacitance retention of 92.5% after 20,000 cycles. As an electrocatalyst, CoNi2S4/CC electrode possesses an excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (overpotential of 84 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and oxygen evolution reaction (228 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) activities in 1.0 M KOH solution. Moreover, the overall water splitting electrolyzer assembled by CoNi2S4/CC exhibits a low cell voltage (1.51 V@10 mA cm(-2)) and a high durability.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000647738900005

However, recent in situ experiments indicated that the morphologies of nanoparticles (NPs) changed greatly under reactive environments. How to correlate the changed structures of the NPs with their catalytic activities in reactions is a challenge in experiment and theory. Herein, we used the multiscale structure reconstruction (MSR) model to generate equilibrium Pt NPs under different CO reaction conditions and then performed surface kinetics modeling to explore the corresponding catalytic activities. Our results show that the structure and catalytic activity of the NP may both change in changing gaseous environments, which are completely different from the results using the stationary model. We also predict the optimized CO oxidation over the Pt catalyst with the consideration of the dependence of reaction condition on the nanoparticle morphology. This work enlightens the importance of modeling the reaction-condition dependent morphology on the understanding of realistic catalytic activity of NPs.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000697335100016

Here, taking bismuth tantalum oxyhalogen (Bi4TaO8X) as an example, we unraveled a commonly overlooked phenomenon of photoinduced surface activation, in which the intrinsic active sites generated and dominated the enhanced photocatalytic activity under reaction conditions. We demonstrated that a thin layer of amorphous tantalum oxides species was in situ generated on the surface of the Bi4TaO8X photocatalyst at the initial stage of the photocatalytic reaction, and such amorphous species were proven to be the active sites which can significantly facilitate the photocatalytic water-splitting reactions. The investigation focusing on photoinduced surface activation of photocatalysts under the reaction conditions not only unravels the reactive states of semiconductor photocatalysts but also sheds light on the understanding of photocatalytic mechanisms.									26	2	0	0	2	0	26			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500058

Size and morphology of the nickel nanoparticles were observed using field emission scanning electron microscopy. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy studies confirmed the presence of nickel. Electrocatalytic activity and stability of the grown nickel nanoparticles were investigated by recording cyclic voltammograms and chronoamperometry. Variations in growth parameters, such as reduction time, nickel chloride concentration and number of growth cycles affect the activity of the grown nickel nanoparticles. The grown nickel nanoparticles exhibited electrocatalytic activity towards ethanol electrooxidation reaction. The phase change as a result of mass change that occurred during the redox reactions and ethanol electrooxidation was studied using an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance. The successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method promises to be a viable option for growth of nickel nanoparticles for electrocatalytic applications.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000459944500013

The nitrogen-bonding states can be tuned by varying the annealing temperature. The best electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in terms of both onset potential and limiting current density can be achieved for the catalyst annealed at an optimal temperature of 800 degrees C because of the high content of graphitic-N catalytic sites and a large specific surface area.									70	1	0	0	6	0	72			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000351435300008	25661238

The goal of this work is to develop active bifunctional catalyst materials for water oxidation and oxygen reduction. Drawing inspiration from a cubane-like CaMn4Ox, the biological catalyst found in the oxygen evolving center (OEC) in photosystem II, nanostructured manganese oxide surfaces were investigated for these reactions. Thin films of nanostructured manganese oxide were found to be active for both oxygen reduction and water oxidation, with similar overall oxygen electrode activity to the best known precious metal nanoparticle catalysts: platinum, ruthenium, and iridium. Physical and chemical characterization of the nanostructured Mn oxide bifunctional catalyst reveals an oxidation state of Mn(III), akin to one of the most commonly observed Mn oxidation states found in the OEC.									1265	36	0	0	71	0	1280			0002-7863			WOS:000282864100017	20839797

Current research interest in this field is focused on the development of earth-abundant photo- or electrocatalytic materials with high activity and long-term stability for hydrogen and/or oxygen evolution reactions. Due to their unique properties and characteristics, carbon and related carbon-based materials show great potential to replace some of the existing precious metal catalysts in water splitting technology. This tutorial review summarizes the recent significant progress in the fabrication and application of metal-free carbonaceous materials as photo- or electrocatalysts for water splitting. Synthetic strategies and applications of various carbonaceous materials, including graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as well as other forms of carbon-containing materials, for electrochemical or photochemical water splitting are presented, accompanied by a discussion of the key scientific issues and prospects for the future development of metal-free photo- and electrocatalysts.									416	21	0	0	23	0	420			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000378260000002	27094875

Oxygen concentration was varied from 16.8% to 36.8% (by volume) by either diluting the air co-flow with nitrogen or by adding oxygen. Planar optical measurements were performed, with high spatial resolution, of flame luminosity at 700nm, soot volume fraction, flame temperature, primary soot particle diameters and OH* chemiluminescence. All measured parameters are found to vary significantly with OC over the investigated range. The soot volume fraction measurements quantify the extent to which soot formation and oxidation are enhanced by increasing OC, revealing that the former effect dominates in the upstream region, while the latter effect dominates the downstream region, close to the flame tip. The changes to flame luminosity, soot volume fraction and flame temperature are strongly correlated with each other, while the primary soot particle diameter correlates well with the soot residence time. In addition, the rate of soot evolution, including its formation and oxidation, correlates with flame temperature along the axis of flames and a second reaction zone emerges in the tip of flames with high OC, as revealed by OH* chemiluminescence. The experimental data are well suited to the development and validation of soot models because of the well-defined boundary conditions, high spatial resolution, systematic nature and combination of the measured scalars.

J	Gessinger, G.H.								Effect of atmosphere on the sintering kinetics of loose silver powder								Zeitschrift fur Metallkunde				61	12			923	8						Dec. 1970	1970	Two types of fine Ag powder were sintered over a wide temperature range in oxygen, vacuum, argon (helium) and hydrogen. The effect of these atmospheres on the sintering kinetics and the evolution of microstructure was investigated. Sintering experiments on two spherical particles in the electron microscope were compared with the shrinkage of a powder aggregate in vacuum. An agreement in results was found at low temperatures. There is a large difference in the shrinkage kinetics of the two powders, due to the difference in initial packing density and the different shape of the powders. A large amount of densification in the irregular powder takes place by particle rearrangement. Oxygen increases the rate of densification of Ag at high temperatures as compared to vacuum or inert gases. Observations on both loose and compressed powders suggest an increase in the grain boundary diffusivity Db due to the adsorption of oxygen in the grain boundary of the neck. At intermediate temperatures the specific surface decreases faster due to a high surface diffusion coefficient. Adsorption of oxygen decreases the surface tension and the rate of shrinkage. Densification in hydrogen is impeded by a hydrogen-impurity reaction.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0044-3093			INSPEC:233159

The two-stage ball milling process provides a scalable and industrially applicable method for producing non-metalloid amorphous nanoparticles. The amorphous nanoparticles displayed excellent catalytic performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH, displaying lower overpotentials than IrO2 at 10 mA cm(-2). The addition of Co in the amorphous alloy reduced the overpotential to 288 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The pairing of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that the improved OER activity of amorphous Ni74.2CO5Nb12.5Y83 was attributed to the catalytic synergy between Y and Co. The integration of Y supported proton-coupled electron-transfer processes that assisted with the electrostatic adsorption of OH- and formation of oxyhydroxide species, while Co sites enabled metal-oxo bonding to prevent Ni overcharging and the stabilization of beta-NiOOH. The catalytic synergy between Y and Co reduces the amount of Co needed to enhance the OER activity of Ni-based alloys and lessens the dependence on Co, which is in high demand in many renewable energy and storage applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000752977200041	34860485

Herein, we report a NPMC consisting of Fe3C nanoparticles encapsulated in mesoporous N-doped carbon (N-C), which is synthesized by a simple two-step strategy comprising pyrolysis of a mixture of MIL-100(Fe) and dicyandiamide under inert atmosphere, followed by treatment of the product with acidic solution to leach removable Fe3C species from the material. Fe3C@NC800 (the material prepared at 800 degrees C) exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity, high durability and excellent methanol tolerance for ORR, with catalytic performance comparable to that of commercial Pt/C in both alkaline and acidic media. Fe3C@NC-800's excellent catalytic activity and stability in ORR are due to its large BET surface area, its large total pore volume, its nitrogen dopants and the cooperative effects between the reactive functionalities in it as well as its excellent conductivity.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000443664700091

Partial replacement of 4-coordinated Zn(II) ions of ZnO with Co(II) ions up to about 10at% has been suggested from evaluation of the products by UV-Vis absorption spectra, morphological observations and X-ray diffraction. The higher addition of Co resulted in its phase-separated precipitation as Co(OH)2. While mesoporous electrode processed from ZnO nanocrystals was totally inactive for water oxidation, that of Co-doped ZnO exhibited a good catalytic activity to achieve about 1 mA cm-2 current of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an overvoltage of 0.545 V in a neutral aqueous KCl solution, which in fact was far superior to a Co3O4 electrode known to suffer from its limited conductivity. The doped Co ions are only expected to act as reaction centers for charge transfer on the very surface in contact with the electrolyte, while ZnO acts as a highly conductive and chemically stable host matrix to support the catalyst. Doping of transition metals into ZnO by the present method thus provides a new strategy to obtain sustainable OER catalysts from earth-abundant elements for conversion and storage of renewable electricity.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1938-5862			INSPEC:19058217

A rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE) study at galena and pyrite in the presence of xanthate								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINERAL PROCESSING				47	1-2			33	47		10.1016/0301-7516(95)00099-2				JUN 1996	1996	According to the mixed potential model for flotation of sulphide minerals with xanthates, oxygen reduction constitutes the cathodic reaction balancing the oxidation of xanthate. The aim of the present work was to determine the mechanism of oxygen reduction at galena and pyrite in the presence of xanthate. As a comparison two inert metals were also studied. The rotating ring disc electrode technique was used to determine the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced at the different materials. Chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry were used to study the adsorption properties of xanthate at platinum, used as ring material for the RRDE's.The oxygen reduction is in all cases inhibited in the presence of xanthate. At galena, platinum and gold the reduction involves only two electrons and hydrogen peroxide can be detected at the ring for gold and platinum in alkaline solution. Further reduction of hydrogen peroxide may take place in parallel to hydrogen evolution. Pyrite is least influenced by the presence of xanthate and the oxygen reduction proceeds with a total of four electrons. In alkaline solution hydrogen peroxide can be detected at the ring electrode. Most interesting is the fact that hydrogen peroxide is formed as a stable product in a large potential region at platinum in the presence of xanthate. This is explained by the adsorption of xanthate at the surface, as revealed from cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The strong adsorption of xanthate on the platinum surface complicates the analysis of the RRDE data.The homogeneous reaction between hydrogen peroxide and xanthate, forming perxanthate was studied in alkaline solution by UV spectrophotometry. It was concluded that the reaction is too slow to effect the determination of hydrogen peroxide at the ring electrode.									16	1	0	0	0	0	17			0301-7516			WOS:A1996UX34100003

However, traditional thermocatalysts generally undergo low catalytic activity and fewer active sites. Herein, this paper synthesizes nearly all-surface-atomic, ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) Co3O4 nanosheets to address these problems through offering a numerous active sites and high electron mobility. The 2D Co3O4 nanosheets (1.70 nm) exhibit catalyzation to the total oxidation of n-hexanal at the lower temperature of T-90% = 202 degrees C, and at the space velocity of 5.0 x 10(4) h(-1). It is over 1.2 and 6 times higher catalytic activity than that of 2D CoO nanosheets (1.71 nm) and bulk Co3O4 counterpart, respectively. Transient absorption spectroscopy analysis shows that the oxygen vacancy defect traps electrons, thereby preventing the recombination with holes, increasing the lifetime of T-1 electrons, and making electron-holes reach a non-dynamic equilibrium. The longer the electron lifetime is, the easier the oxygen vacancy defects capture electrons. Furthermore, the defects combine with oxygen to form active oxygen components. Compared with the lattice oxygen involved in the reaction of bulk Co3O4, the nanosheets change the catalytic reaction path, which effectively reduces the activation energy barrier from 34.07 to 27.15 kJ/mol. The changed surface disorder, the numerous coordinatively-unsaturated Co atoms and the high ratio of O-ads/O-iat on the surface of 2D Co3O4 nanosheets are responsible for the catalytic performance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000728291800007

However, the poor stability of the interface between LDH and flexible carbon textile prepared by hydrothermal and electrodeposition methods greatly affects its active area and cyclic stability during deformation. Here, we report a salt-template-assisted method for the growth of two-dimensional (2D) amorphous ternary LDH based on dip-rolling technology. The robust and high-dimensional structure constructed by salt-template and fiber could achieve a carbon textile-based water splitting catalyst with high loading, strong catalytic activity, and good stability. The prepared 2D NiFeCo-LDH/CF electrode showed overpotentials of 220 mV and 151 mV in oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions, respectively, and simultaneously had no significant performance decrease after 100 consecutive bendings. This work provides a new strategy for efficiently designing robust, high-performance LDH on flexible fibers, which may have great potential in commercial applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-4991		WOS:000831894700001	35889644

By reactively sputtering in a high O-2 flow-rate environment, vertically oriented IrOx nanoplatelets grow several hundred nanometers high exhibiting large surface areas and antireflective optical properties across the visible spectrum. The nanoplatelet IrOx surface is electrochemically compared to other morphologies of IrOx surfaces for OER activity. It was found that the nanoplatelet IrOx surface outperforms all other tested morphologies and planar Ir-metal by exhibiting higher currents and lower overpotentials. Longevity testing of catalytic activity shows that the nanoplatelet surface is more stable in a wide pH range. Characterization with X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows that the stoichiometry and oxidation states are similar between the different morphologies of IrOx, but the preferred crystallographic orientation of the rutile IrOx film changes at higher O-2 flow rates. The change from a (110) to a (101) growth direction corresponds with higher OER activity. Nanoplatelet IrOx films are therefore found to expose active sites preferable for the OER, and when combined with their antireflective properties these surfaces are promising for solar water-splitting applications.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1932-7447			WOS:000435611900010

Water electrolysis is an ideal alternative for large-scale hydrogen production, as it does not produce any carbon-based pollutant byproducts. The production of green hydrogen from water electrolysis using intermittent sources (e.g., solar and colic sources) would facilitate clean energy storage. However, the electrocatalysts currently required for water electrolysis are noble metals, making this potential option expensive and inaccessible for industrial applications. Therefore, there is a need to develop electrocatalysts based on earth-abundant and low-cost metals. Nickel-based electrocatalysts are a fitting alternative because they are economically accessible. Extensive research has focused on developing nickel-based electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution. Theoretical and experimental work have addressed the elucidation of these electrochemical processes and the role of heteroatoms, structure, and morphology. Even though some works tend to be contradictory, they have lit up the path for the development of efficient nickel-based electrocatalysts. For these reasons, a review of recent progress is presented herein.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				1996-1073		WOS:000771377800001

The substrate has an iridium containing coating on the carrier material and containing an iridium oxide, iridium hydroxide, and/or iridium hydroxy oxide. The catalyst contains iridium in an amount of not greater than 60 wt.%. The coating has iridium load of maximum of 0.4 mg/cm2. USE - The coated membrane is useful as membrane-electrode unit for water electrolysis and water electrolytic cell (all claimed). ADVANTAGE - The membrane-electrode unit has high conversion rates, and provides hydrogen in high purity via water electrolysis. The catalyst composition has high stability under very corrosive conditions of the oxygen evolution reaction, i.e. ruthenium and iridium and their oxides are particularly suitable as catalyst materials. The catalytically active metals or metal oxides can optionally be present on a support material in order to increase the specific surface area of the catalyst material. In the case of the carrier materials, only those materials come into consideration which have a sufficiently high stability, such as transition metal oxide or oxides of certain main group elements such as Al2O3. However, many of these oxidic carrier materials are electrically non-conductive, which has a negative effect on the efficiency of the oxidization reaction.															0						DIIDW:202284579W

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunable compositions are promising precursors for the fabrication of hollow and porous electrocatalysts. However, pulverous MOFs usually suffer from agglomeration during pyrolysis, greatly reducing the activity of their derived catalysts. In this work, Prussian blue analogue (PBA) arrays with hierarchical multidimensional architecture were directly grown on nickel foam (NF) using a template-oriented method. The subsequent calcination in air allowed for obtaining NixCo3-xO4 nanoplate arrays consisting of porous and hollow nanocubes. The derived bimetallic NixCo3-xO4/NF required only an overpotential of 287 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution, which is much lower than that of the monometallic NiO and the RuO2 benchmark. The 3D intersectional architecture of the NixCo3-xO4 nanoplates and the porous and hollow nanocube subunits contributed to the large specific surface area and reduced charge-transfer resistance of the NixCo3-xO4/NF electrode. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and post-OER characterization revealed that the incorporated Co was the active sites and electrochemical active CoOOH intermediates were in situ formed during the OER. Our study provides a facile and efficient strategy for the rational design of MOF-derived materials towards effective and low-cost electrocatalysis.									41	5	0	0	1	0	42			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000472559800036	31184359

The loss of aliphatic carbon with increasing temperature arises not from aromatization but from outgassing of hydrocarbons or evolution of CO and CO2 formed by reactions between oxygen and the film. Infrared spectra are presented which show absorption features not previously seen for this material. The changing structure with heat treatment and the role of oxygen in the formation and modification of the material are discussed.									45	1	0	0	0	0	46			0008-6223			WOS:A1993LG47500006

By replacing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and competitive chlorine evolution reaction (ClER) with the thermodynamically favorable anodic hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) in alkaline seawater, energy-saving hydrogen production can be achieved. In this study, Fe/Co dual-doped Ni2P and MIL-FeCoNi heterostructures (FeCo-Ni2P@MIL-FeCoNi) arrays with simultaneous cation doping and hetero-engineering provide excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance for HzOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline seawater electrolyte. Overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) in seawater is impressive, with a low cell voltage of only 400 mV required to reach 1000 mA cm(-2) and stable operation for 1000 h to maintain above 500 mA cm(-2). As a proof-of-concept, the OHzS system can save 3.03 kW h when producing 1.0 L of H-2 when compared with the N2H4-free seawater system, resulting in energy-saving H-2 production. Density functional theory calculations show that the combination of Co-doping and the fabrication of FeCo-Ni2P and MIL-FeCoNi heterointerfaces can result in a low water dissociation barrier, optimized hydrogen adsorption free energy toward HER, and favorable adsorbed dehydrogenation kinetics for HzOR. This processing route paves the way for a practical approach to the efficient utilization of hydrogen, which is abundant in the ocean energy field, to achieve a carbon-neutral hydrogen economy.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000755104200001

However, using such catalysts for a multistep organic reaction in one reaction system has rarely been achieved. Here, we investigate multiple active sites on Pd-CeO2 catalysts and optimize them for a multistep reaction of C-C cross-coupling and alcohol oxidation. Atomic-level imaging and spectroscopic studies reveal that metallic Pd-0 and Pd-CeO2 interface are active sites on Pd-CeO2 for C-C cross-coupling and oxidation, respectively. These active sites are controlled under the structural evolution of Pd-CeO2 during reductive heat-treatments. Accordingly, we found that optimally reduced Pd-CeO2 catalysts containing similar to 1.5 nm-sized Pd nanoclusters with both sites in balance are ideal for multistep chemical transformations in one reaction system. Our strategy to design supported metal catalysts leads to one-pot sequential synthetic protocols for pharmaceutical building blocks.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000746505900001

However, they are typically provided with poor electrical conductivity, which is insufficient for them to work as satisfying electrocatalysts. Designing and fabricating MOFs/COFs with high conductivity presents a new avenue towards special electrochemical reactions. This minireview firstly highlighted the origin and design principles of conductive MOFs/COFs for electrocatalysis on the basis of typical charge transfer mechanisms, that is "through space", "extended conjugation" and "through bond". An overview of conductive MOFs/COFs used in the electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), water splitting and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was then made to track the very recent progress. In the final remarks, the present challenges and perspectives for the use of conductive MOFs/COFs as electrocatalysts including their structural optimization, feasible applications and structure-activity correlation are proposed.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000732838000001	34935018

The GRI-Mech 3.0 mechanism is combined with an extensive set of ion chemistry pathways and the forward propagation of uncertainty from model parameters to observables is performed using response surfaces. The UQ analysis considers 22 uncertain rate parameters, which include both chemi-ionization, proton transfer, and electron attachment reactions as well as neutral reactions pertaining to the chemistry of the CH radical. The uncertainty ranges for each rate parameter are discussed. Our results indicate that the uncertainty in the time evolution of the electron number density is due mostly to the chemi-ionization reaction CH + O reversible arrow HCO+ + E- and to the main CH consumption reaction CH + O-2 reversible arrow O + HCO. Similar conclusions hold for the hydronium ion H3O+, since electrons and H3O+ account for more than 99% of the total negative and positive charge density, respectively. Surprisingly, the statistics of the number density of charged species show very little sensitivity to the uncertainty in the rate of the recombination reaction H3O+ + E- -> products, until very late in the decay process, when the electron number density has fallen below 20% of its peak value. Finally, uncertainties in the secondary reactions within networks leading to the formation of minor ions (e.g., C2H3O+, HCO+, OH-, and O-) do not play any role in controlling the mean and variance of electrons and H3O+, but do affect the statistics of the minor ions significantly. The observed trends point to the role of key neutral reactions in controlling the mean and variance of the charged species number density in an indirect fashion. Furthermore, total sensitivity indices provide quantitative metrics to focus future efforts aiming at improving the rates of key reactions responsible for the formation of charges during hydrocarbon combustion.

In this paper, CdxZn1-xS (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1) nano-branches are fabricated and the piezocatalytic and photocatalytic H2O2 evolution performance are studied. Under ultrasound condition, the H2O2 yield of as-synthesized solid solutions is all higher than those of pristine ZnS and CdS, and optimal evolution rate achieves 21.9 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) for Cd0.5Zn0.5S without any sacrificial agent, while it is increased to 151.6 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) under visible light irradiation. The piezo/photoelectrochemical tests, piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), and computational simulation reveal that the nano-branch structure benefits the mechanical energy conversion more, favoring the H2O2 evolution for Cd0.5Zn0.5S, and a higher concentration of charge carriers is generated in photocatalysis. The active radical trapping and in situ electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments demonstrate that both of the H2O2 generation pathways are originated from oxygen reduction by the sequential two-step single-electron reaction. This work opens a door for promoting the H2O2 production from nanostructure and solid solution design.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000780104500001	35403802

Detailed kinetic data have been obtained from UV-vis stopped-flow experiments, and these data have been analyzed using reaction progress kinetic analysis. The graphical plots show that there are three clear phases in the reaction: catalyst activation, water oxidation catalysis, and cerium concentration controlled catalysis at the end of the reaction. The ligand attached to the IrCp* complex has a clear influence on both the activation as well as the catalysis. Some bidentate ligands result in relatively slow catalysis, and the first-order in iridium supports the presence of mononuclear active species; however, other bidentates form the more active dinuclear species. Monodentate ligands allow the formation of bis-p-oxo bridged dimeric species, supported by kinetics displaying 1.6-order in [Ir], leading to high reaction rates.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			2155-5435			WOS:000377326700001

Although several COFs are being utilized for photocatalytic H2 production and CO2 reduction, few of them can realize the challenging water oxidation under visible light. Herein, we present the visible-light-driven photocatalytic water oxidation on bipyridine-based COFs (Bp-COF), which was synthesized through the Schiff base condensation reaction. Bp-COF displays impressive visible-light-driven water oxidation activity with O-2 evolution rate of 152 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) after coordinating with Co2+. Furthermore, the Bp-COF could also enable photocatalytic H-2 production under visible light. The unique photocatalytic performance of BpCo-COF for both water oxidation and proton reduction could be attributed to its excellent light harvesting property, appropriate energy band structure, high porosity and wettability as well as coordinated cobalt for photocatalytic water splitting. This work demonstrates the potential of COFs as semiconductors for photocatalytic solar fuels conversion.									69	6	0	0	6	0	70			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000501613700007

The pseudo-Tafel curves of the overpotential vs. log (ii(L)/(i(L) - i)) show a two-slope behavior, probably due to different adsorption mechanisms. The potential relaxations as functions of log (t + tau) and log (-d eta/dt) have been plotted. The variations of these slopes and the dependence of the double-layer capacitance on the overpotential depended on the electrode manufacture and the kind of electrolyte (whether containing the fluorinated additive or not).									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0013-4651			WOS:A1995RZ32800017

They can grow with or without oxygen or light. Microbes can dissolve or precipitate ores and are able to yield energy from the reduction/oxidation of metal ions. Their metabolism depends on the availability of metal ions in essential amounts and protects itself from toxic amounts of metals by detoxification processes. Metals are metabolised to metallorgano-compounds, bound to proteins or used as catalytic centres of enzymes in biological reactions. Microbes, as every other cell, have developed a whole range of mechanisms for the uptake and excretion of metals and their metabolised compounds. The diversity of microbial metabolism can be illustrated by the fact that certain microbes can be found living on arsenate, which is considered a highly toxic metal for most other forms of live.									21	3	0	0	15	0	24			0036-8504			MEDLINE:15079996	15079996

In this comprehensive study, firstly, the preparation advances of MXenes are systematically summarized. Then, the representative applications of MXenes-based HER electrocatalysts are introduced, from experimental and theoretical aspects. Thirdly, the strategies for improving HER catalytic activity of MXenes are demonstrated, such as optimizing active sites by termination modification and metal-atom doping, increasing active sites by fabricating various nanostructures. Finally, the existing challenges and new opportunities for MXenes-based electrocatalysts are also elucidated.

Recent upgrades of experimental tools and computational capabilities, as well as the advent of two-dimensional materials, have opened new opportunities and challenges for surface science. In this Perspective, we highlight recent advances in application fields strictly connected to novel concepts emerging in surface science. Specifically, we show for selected case-study examples that surface oxidation can be unexpectedly beneficial for improving the efficiency in electrocatalysis (the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction) and photocatalysis, as well as in gas sensing. Moreover, we discuss the adsorption-assisted mechanism in membrane distillation for seawater desalination, as well as the use of surface-science tools in the study of Li-ion batteries. In all these applications, surface-science methodologies (both experimental and theoretical) have unveiled new physicochemical processes, whose efficiency can be further tuned by controlling surface phenomena, thus paving the way for a new era for the investigation of surfaces and interfaces of nanomaterials. In addition, we discuss the role of surface scientists in contemporary condensed matter physics, taking as case-study examples specific controversial debates concerning unexpected phenomena emerging in nanosheets of layered materials, solved by adopting a surface-science approach.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000646815600002	32926041

In this work, by means of first-principles computations, we designed a series of single atom catalysts consisting of atomic transition metals anchored onto defective hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) with boron vacancies (TM@h-BN). Among all nine candidates, our results revealed that Cu@h-BN and Ni@h-BN showed excellent NOER performances with relatively low limiting potentials of 0.23 and 0.31 V, respectively, which are comparable to (or even better than) that of the benchmark Pt catalyst (0.25 V). Moreover, Cu@h-BN and Ni@h-BN can significantly inhibit the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, suggesting that the promoted ammonia formation is a low-potential and highly selective process.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000581179800045	33015694

Developing low-cost and highly active catalyst remains an enormous challenge. Herein, we reported a simple approach to synthesize a molybdenum disulfide/micrometer-scale biomass carbon tube matrix (BCTM) which is derived from available and accessible plant wild celery. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheet could be well dispersed on the BCTM to form porous structure, while the BCTM can enhance the conductivity of MoS2 nano sheet. The synergistic effects between the MoS2 nanosheet and BCTM contribute to high hydrogen evolution reaction activity. MoS2/BCTM shows admirable catalytic ability with a low overpotential of 176 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope 51 mV.dec(-1), and outstanding stability over 2000 cycles under acidic conditions. This novel strategy provides a low-cost route to synthesize excellent MoS2-based catalyst, which may widely apply in the fields of electrocatalysis and photocatalysis.

Herein, metal-doped dicyandiamide formaldehyde resin is innovatively exploited to synthesize N/Co/Fe/Ni multi-doped carbon nanotubes (denoted as CoFeNi@CNT) with metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) and CoFeNi nanoparticles as the ORR and OER active sites, respectively. Abundant active sites and high degree of graphitization enable CoFeNi@CNT with a high ORR half-wave potential of 0.82 V and a low OER overpotential of 440 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which are comparable or superior to noble-metal catalysts. Particularly, the CoFeNi@CNT air electrode of rechargeable Zn-air batteries shows remarkable open circuit potential (1.46 V), discharge power density (152.3 mW cm(-2)), specific capacity (814 mAh g(-1)), and cycling stability for more than 250 h. It is worth emphasizing that this synthesis strategy is rather simple, low-cost, high yield, and the proportion and amount of doped metal ions can be easily adjusted according to the needs for different applications.

The key species such as intermediates and radicals together with products involved in the oxidation are observed online and confirmed in photoionization mass spectra. The reaction potential energy surfaces of the transient C4H5O and C4H6OCl radicals, formed from the hydrogen-abstraction reaction and the addition reaction of MACR with Cl atoms, with oxygen have been theoretically calculated to illuminate the formation of the peroxy radicals of C4H5OO2 and C4H6OClO2. The photoionization processes of these peroxy radicals, whose cations are not stable, and their individual self-reactions as well as bimolecular reactions with HO2 radical are studied and discussed. In addition, kinetic experiments are also performed to get the time evolution of specific products and compared with theoretical models, providing a detailed insight into the reaction mechanism of the Cl-initiated oxidation of MACR.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000823818700001	35822339

Here, by simply refluxing g-C3N4 in H2O2, oxygenous groups are introduced into g-C3N4. The resultant oxygenous groups modified g-C3N4 (g-C3N4 (H2O2)) exhibits significantly improved hydrophilic ability and photocatalytic oxidative ability. It is well evidenced that valence band position is positive shifted significantly by introduction of surface oxygenous groups. However, the photocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution is not improved obviously, suggesting that the driving force for water oxidation is not increased simultaneously. Luckily, the photocatalytic oxidative activity of the modified g-C3N4 (include oxygen evolution, pollutant degradation and antibacterial property) could be further improved after forming TiO2 containing nanocomposites during the H2O2 reflux treatment with the addition of tertrabutyl titanate (g-C3N4/ TiO2 (H2O2) due to much increased driving force and accelerated charge migration. Herein, a facile and simple method is proposed to engineer the band structure of g-C3N4 for improving its photocatalytic oxidative ability, which expand the application of carbon nitride.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000691463900001

In this paper, NiFe MOF/NF with a two-dimensional layered vertical structure were prepared by bottom-up solvothermal method. We used different solvent mixtures (methanol/water, ethanol/water, acetone/water, N, N-dimethylformamide/water) to control the synthesis of MOF and found that the oligpolar solvent mixture of acetone and water was the best in controlling the formation of these two-dimensional MOFs. The obtained NiFe MOF/NF in acetone/water appeared the best performance as electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction, in which the NiFe MOF/NF delivered a current density of 50 mA.cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 270 mV with a small Tafel slope of 55 mV.dec (-1).

The development of stable, highly active, and cost-effective OER catalyst supports would facilitate commercialization of water electrolysis technologies. In this study, we report for the first time the use of metallic cobalt nitride (Co4N) nanofibers (NFs) as highly stable and conductive scaffolds for supporting Ir nanoparticles (NPs). The Ir catalysts supported on Co4N NFs exhibit high OER activity and stability in alkaline media as compared with Ir catalysts supported on other materials (Co3O4 or carbon NFs) and commercial Ir/C. These results are attributed to the (i) efficient charge or mass transport between Ir NPs and metallic one-dimensional (1D) Co4N NFs or interfibers, (ii) maintenance of the active oxidation state (Ir3+) of Ir NPs induced by synergistic charge compensation between catalyst and support during OER, and (iii) long-term stability induced by strong metal support interactions.									38	2	0	0	1	0	38			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000444792800018

This surface modification not only accelerates the interface transfer rate of charge carriers but also reduces the excessive energy barrier for O-O formation, thus leading to enhanced reaction kinetics for photocatalytic water oxidation. The optimum oxygen evolution rates (OERs) of the Co(OH)(2)/g-C3N4 sample reached 27.4 and 7.1 mu mol h(-1) under UV-vis (lambda > 300 nm) and visible light (lambda > 420 nm) irradiation, which are 5.5 and 7 times faster than those for pristine g-C3N4, respectively.

Non-Maxwellian O(D-1) distributions have been calculated at altitudes of 25 and 50 km taking into account the energy transfer and quenching collisions of fast O(D-1) atoms with the ambient gas. The evolution of the energy distributions of nascent metastable oxygen atoms, produced by ozone photolysis, has been determined by solving the time-dependent Boltzmann equation. The time-dependent and steady state O(D-1) distributions have been computed and used for calculations of parameters characterizing O(D-1) thermalization and quenching in the stratosphere and mesosphere. The steady state O(D-1) distributions contain 3 - 5% of nonthermal atoms, fractions which are significantly larger than those of nonthermal ground state oxygen or nitrogen atoms. The effective temperatures of the non-Maxwellian distributions have been found to be 14% and 33% higher than thermal temperatures of the ambient gas at 25 and 50 km. The nonequilibrium rate coefficients and yields of NO molecules in the atmospheric reaction O(D-1) + N2O corresponding to the non-Maxwellian distributions of O(D-1) atoms have been calculated.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2169-897X			WOS:000224409200005

The delicate manipulation of metal/semiconductor heterointerfaces represents a powerful leverage to boost the electrocatalytic performance due to the Mott-Schottky effect. Herein, we demonstrate a typical Mott-Schottky electrocatalyst by ingeniously encasing Co/Co(3)O(4 )hetero-nanoparticles within the inner tips of N-doped carbon nanotubes (abbreviated as Co/Co3O4 @N-CNTs hereafter) through a facile and scalable hydrogel-bridged pyrolysis strategy. Experimental and theoretical findings collectively manifest that the spontaneous charge redistribution at the Co/Co(3)O(4 )heterointerfaces is essential to promote the charge transfer capability, lower down the reaction barriers for oxygen electrocatalysis, and ulti-mately boost the intrinsic activities. Accordingly, the well-designed Co/Co3O4 @N-CNTs exhibit admirable ORR and OER activities and long-term robustness in KOH medium, exceeding the commercial Pt/C and RuO2 benchmarks, respectively. Furthermore, the Co/Co3O4 @N-CNTs-assembled flexible all-solid-state zinc-air battery displays a high power density, remarkable rate capability, excellent rechargeablity and outstanding mechanical flexibility even under severe deformations, predicting the great potentials in diverse next-generation wearable electronic devices. The rationale of the construction of Mott-Schottky heterojunctions may provide an innovative and instructive avenue to design diversified energy nanomaterials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000822983000004

Glycerol oxidation is made up of complex pathway reactions that can produce a large number of useful intermediates or valuable fine chemicals with presently limited market impact due to expensive production processes. Many of these chemical oxidation routes lead to significant amounts of undesired by-products, and enzymatic processes are limited. Converse to classical heterogeneous processes, electrocatalytic oxidation processes can be tuned by controlling the nature, composition and structure of the electrocatalyts as well as the electrode potential. Such control may lead to very high selectivity and activity, avoiding or limiting product separation steps. The coupling of glycerol oxidation to produce chemicals with the oxygen reduction reaction in a fuel cell or water reduction reaction in an electrolysis cell on Pt-free catalysts results either in coproduction of electrical energy or hydrogen for energy storage.									188	4	0	0	4	0	190			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000311056800001	23112136

From the simulation results, we find that the O Penning ionization plays a leading role in the discharge characteristics. As the air content increases from 0 ppm to 5000 ppm, the current waveforms show a transition from a single-pulse mode to MCP mode, and the number of current pulses also increases. Through analysis, we find that although increases monotonically, the evolution mechanism of the MCP discharges under different ranges of air content is different. At lower air concentration (less than 500 ppm here), we find the similar explanation as that reported in our previous work on the MCP behavior only considering N impurity. However, when the air content is higher, we find that the seed electron density remains basically unchanged, not like the sharp drop at lower air concentration. Further analysis reveals that the rapid growth of direct ionization during a small period before the breakdown helps generate MCP discharges. In addition, the attachment reaction of is analyzed. Results show that at higher air content (above 5000 ppm here), the attachment reaction will provide more possibilities of successive ignitions after the first pulse with the assistance of the applied voltage, implying a stimulative effect of the oxygen on MCP discharges.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			2169-3536			WOS:000525422700114

Herein, we present the design of Ag-coated Aunanostar (core-shell-type Au@Ag nanostar) monomer structuresassembled on rectangular DNA origami and study their electro-catalytic activities through OER, which remains unexplored. Ourdesigned DNA origami-templated bimetallic nanostar catalystshowed excellent OER activity and high stability without usingany external binder and exhibited a current density of 10 mA cm-2at a low overpotential of 266 mV, which was smaller than those of ss-DNA-functionalized Au@Ag nanostars and DNA origami-templated pure Au nanostars. Our results reveal that DNA origami-assembled core-shell Au@Ag nanostars show betterelectrocatalytic performance as compared to pure-core Au nanostars immobilized on DNA origami, owing to the presence of a highlyconductive Ag layer. Such controlled assembly of bimetallic nanostructures on a DNA origami template can provide additionalelectrochemical surface area and a higher density of active sites resulting in enhanced electrocatalysis									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000797817500002

Herein, we prepare the N-doped graphene-decorated NiCo alloy coupled with mesoporous NiCoMoO nano-sheet grown on 3D nickel foam (NiCo@C-NiCoMoO/NF) for water splitting. NiCo@C-NiCoMoO/NF exhibits outstanding activity with low overpotentials for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER: 39/266 mV; OER: 260/390 mV) at +/- 10 and +/- 1000 mA cm(-2). More importantly, in 6.0 M KOH solution at 60 degrees C for WE, it only requires 1.90 V to reach 1000 mA cm(-2) and shows excellent stability for 43 h, exhibiting the potential for actual application. The good performance can be assigned to N-doped graphene-decorated NiCo alloy and mesoporous NiCoMoO nano-sheet, which not only increase the intrinsic activity and expose abundant catalytic activity sites, but also enhance its chemical and mechanical stability. This work thus could provide a promising material for industrial hydrogen production.									43	2	0	0	3	0	43			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000619826300001

However, the power conversion efficiencies fall in a wide range (similar to 0.6-18%). Therefore, the perovskite growth and nucleation on GO/RGO require fundamental understanding to improve device function for controlled fabrication, which remain a major challenge. We analyze the surface morphology and crystallization of the lead halide perovskites (MAPbX(3)) at 20-300 degrees C on GO using X-ray diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy. To determine defect mechanisms and their composition, we perform in situ transmission infrared and micro Raman spectroscopy, and the cross-sectional scanning microscopy that captures interfacial imperfections with the oxygen defects. We demonstrate the oxygen-induced defects at the MAPbX(3)/GO interfaces that initiate at room temperature, and occur through the nucleophilic substitution reactions. Unexpectedly, structural defects nucleate in GO forming chemically reduced GO, and modify the surface morphology that yield a poor perovskite growth. Our theoretical studies also reveal that energetically favorable, exothermic reactions between the halides of the perovskite precursors and the oxygen groups of GO generate acidic reaction by-products (i.e. HX), that confirm the formation of oxygen-induced defects.									19	2	0	0	2	0	19			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000423466100011

Reducing the size of catalysts down to the nanometer regime is critical for enhancing the electrochemical performance because reactions mostly occur at the surface of materials. However, fully exploiting the advantage of small nanocatalysts is challenging because accessible catalytic surface area is reduced by particle aggregation and the use of binders. In addition, a significant fraction of nanocatalysts is lost through the electrode pores during catalyst loading. Here, a simple strategy to efficiently load nanocatalysts without using binders is reported. By introducing a thin layer of graphene nanosheets on a porous membrane, a uniform nanocatalyst film via vacuum filtration of the dispersion can be created. The nanocatalyst/graphene composite can be transferred to a carbon paper without fracturing to function as a catalyst layer. The method is compatible with various nanomaterials to realize electrodes for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions and even bifunctional electrodes that exhibit activities for both. Significantly, the resulting electrodes show better performance than those produced by directly filtrating through the carbon paper. Moreover, the binder-free surface allows for further enhancement in catalytic activity via postchemical treatments.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2196-7350			WOS:000714879500001

In the pursuit of sodium chemistry, recently the alluaudite framework Na2M2(SO4)(3) has been unveiled as a high-voltage sodium insertion system. In this context, the framework of density functional theory has been applied to systematically investigate the crystal structure evolution, density of states and charge transfer with sodium ions insertion, and the corresponding average redox potential, for Na2M2(SO4)(3) (M = Fe, Mn, Co and Ni). It is shown that full removal of sodium atoms from the Fe-based device is not a favorable process due to the 8% volume shrinkage. The imaginary frequencies obtained in the phonon dispersion also reflect this instability and the possible phase transition. This high volume change has not been observed in the cases of the Co- and Ni-based compounds. This is because the redox reaction assumes a different mechanism for each of the compounds investigated. For the polyanion with Fe, the removal of sodium ions induces a charge reorganization at the Fe centers. For the Mn case, the redox process induces a charge reorganization of the Mn centers with a small participation of the oxygen atoms. The Co and Ni compounds present a distinct trend with the redox reaction occurring with a strong participation of the oxygen sublattice, resulting in a very small volume change upon desodiation. Moreover, the average deintercalation potential for each of the compounds has been computed. The implications of our findings have been discussed both from the scientific perspective and in terms of technological aspects.									32	1	0	0	0	0	33			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000373570200042	26996444

At potentials positive to the hydrogen evolution, a solid solution of Pt with some Fe is present that can be explained by underpotential deposition of Fe. In the potential region where hydrogen evolution by proton reduction is a side reaction, oxygen is detected in the films. The 0 content scales with the Fe content and at least part of the Fe is oxidized. When applying more cathodic potentials, the fraction of Fe and 0 increases, grain size is reduced and an amorphous/nanocrystalline phase forms. The Fe content is pH dependent in this potential region. At even more cathodic potentials, overpotential deposition of Fe in the bcc structure sets in, the O content is reduced. The results are discussed with respect to thermodynamics in the Fe-Pt-(O) system. The concepts of underpotential deposition of Fe during Fe-Pt alloy deposition and of hydroxide formation due to a pH rise at the cathode are evaluated. These simple models can only partially describe the deposition process in agreement with the compositional and structural information obtained and a coupled mechanism is proposed.

Herein, we develop a ternary catalyst Ru&Fe-WOx for boosting both HER and MFO in alkaline media. An electrode pair based on Ru&Fe-WOx delivers 10/100/500 mA/cm2 current density at a low cell-potential of 1.38/1.50/1.62 V with excellent durability and nearly 100 % Faradaic efficiency (FE), outperforming the benchmark pair of Pt/C||RuO2. By using integrated experimental and theoretical approaches, we verify synergy between WOx host and Ru&Fe-based dopants, which results in optimized H* adsorption on lattice oxygen (HER) as well as enhanced HCOO* desorption on ruthenium site (MFO). In addition, the unique nanostructure of Ru&Fe-WOx may further benefit to the mass transfer and catalyst robustness at large current density. This work thus demonstrates an integrated catalyst design, which is highly efficient for boosting concurrent, cost-effective and scalable production of hydrogen and formate.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000706857300006

Introducing lattice strain is an effective strategy to develop efficient electrocatalysts. However, lattice strain is typically co-created with heterostructure, vacancy, or substrate effects, which complicate the identification of the strain-activity correlation. Herein, a series of lattice-strained homogeneous NiS(x)Se(1-)(x)nanosheets@nanorods hybrids are designed and synthesized by a facile strategy. The NiS(0.5)Se(0.5)with approximate to 2.7% lattice strain exhibits outstanding activity for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER), affording low overpotentials of 70 and 257 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, as well as excellent long-term durability even at a large current density of 100 mA cm(-2)(300 h), significantly superior to other benchmarks and the precious metal catalysts. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the generated lattice strain decreases the metal d-orbital overlap, leading to a narrower bandwidth and a closer d-band center toward the Fermi level. Thus, NiS(0.5)Se(0.5)possesses favorable H* adsorption kinetics for HER and lower energy barriers for OER. This work provides a new insight to regulate the lattice strain of advanced catalyst materials and further improve the performance of energy conversion technologies.									80	3	0	0	1	0	80			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000564439800001	32870547

Specifically, pyrite-type NiS2 and NiSe2 have been used as electrocatalysts for oxygen or hydrogen evolution reactions. These pyrites have also been used in batteries and solar cells due to their optoelectronic and transport properties. The phase evolution of pyrite NiS2 and polymorphism of NiSe2 have briefly been studied in the literature, but there has been limited work focusing on the phase transformations within each of these two systems. Using experiments and calculations, we detail how pyrite NiS2 nano-crystals decompose into hexagonal alpha-NiS, and how the synthesis of pyrite NiSe2 nanocrystals is affected by the presence of two polymorphs, a metastable orthorhombic marcasite phase and a more stable cubic pyrite phase. Each reaction can be controlled by fine-tuning the reaction parameters, including temperature, time, and the precursor identity and concentration. Interestingly, both NiS2 and NiSe2 nanopyrites are active catalysts in the selective reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline, in agreement with other catalysts containing an fcc (sub) lattice. Our results demonstrate a feasible, logical process for synthesizing nanocrystalline pyrites without common byproducts or impurities. This work can help in solving a major problem suspected in preventing pyrite FeS2 and similar materials from large-scale use: the presence of small amounts of secondary phases and impurities.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000743542000001

The first one (model-I) takes into account the solid-state diffusion in LSCF coupled with a global reaction of oxygen exchange while the second one (model-II) is based on a detailed elementary description of the reaction mechanism. The relevance of model-II to predict the voltammograms has been checked with experimental data obtained at different operating temperatures and imposed scan rates. The CV response of porous and quasi-dense electrodes has been studied with the two models and has been discussed in the frame of the zone diagram method. It has been shown that the peaks of the voltammograms are due to the transient change of the oxygen stoichiometry in LSCF. As this evolution is mainly governed by the oxygen diffusion in the material coupled to the reaction of oxygen exchange, it has been established that model-I can provide a satisfactory approximation of the CV curves if the exchange rate constant k(chem) is determined far from equilibrium. It has been also shown that the voltammograms are strongly distorted by the Ohmic losses making their interpretation impossible in practice, under the classical operating conditions of the solid oxide cells. To overcome this limitation, a methodology based on the modelling approach has been proposed to remove the Ohmic losses from the voltammograms and hence to reveal the voltammetry peaks. Finally, the impact of the LSCF decomposition on the CV response has been estimated with model-II. It has been established that the surface passivation and the decrease of the chemical diffusivity can substantially affect the shape of the voltammograms.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0167-2738	1872-7689		WOS:000705334000002

However, active sites of chemically produced NPs are limited because of the adsorption of chemical residues. Therefore, the development of a physical approach to produce NPs having surfaces free from chemical contamination is imperative to electrochemical water splitting. Here, we present a physical top-down approach where suspended NPs generated via pulsed laser ablation in liquids are electrophoretic deposited on a substrate to fabricate ready-to-use electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. Three different laser pulse energies were used to ablate Ni plate in pure water or aqueous media of 1M polyethylene glycol (PEG) to produce six different colloidal solutions of NPs. The samples produced in the water at higher laser pulse energies have Ni/NiO phase in abundance, while those produced in PEG dominate Ni/Ni(OH)(2) phase. Among all the electrophoretically fabricated electrocatalysts, Ni-Di-70 is the best performer in overall water splitting, while Ni-P-30 is the worse. We believe that the selective adsorption of H*, responsible for hydrogen evolution reaction, at Ni sites, and OH - ions, oxygen evolution intermediate, at NiO sites of Ni/NiO interface increase hydrogen and oxygen generation performances of Ni-Di-70 sample. The poor performance of PEG produced electrocatalysts is attributed to the combined effects of the formation of a larger assembly of NPs and adsorption of PEG molecules on the active sites.

The evolution profiles of four classes of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in the toluene-soluble (TS) fractions were determined using an HPLC method. The influence of the type of gas on heat-treatment characteristics of the pitches was clearly identified. The evolution of the different classes of PAH present in the TS of a coal tar pitch to yield toluene-insoluble (TI) material is more significant and faster under air-blowing than under argon-blowing. The presence of oxygen promotes a general increase in the reactivity of the TS, especially in the case of the peri-condensed compounds. The topology of the latter strongly determines their higher increase of reactivity with oxygen. The reactivity of the cata-condensed PAH is significantly higher in the case of the petroleum pitch due to the higher presence of alkyl substituents. It is therefore concluded that the chemical composition of the raw pitches influences their behavior during the carbonization under gas-blowing conditions. The evolution of cata- and peri-condensed compounds during the heat-treatment of the pitches under gas-blowing conditions did not always fit simple first-order kinetics. A model for the overall. reaction pathway was proposed, in which p-resins constitute an intermediate product in the transformation of TS to quinoline-insoluble (QI). A good correlation between some thermal parameters obtained by TGA/DTG: and the chemical composition of the pitches expressed in terms of their HPLC compound class distribution was found.									16	1	0	0	1	1	16			0887-0624			WOS:000086031300016

In this work, a new material, Cobalt Tungsten Oxide Hydroxide Hydrate (CTOHH) on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) scaffold having chain-like morphology has been prepared for the first time by a facile microwave heating method. The same CTOHH was also prepared without the DNA scaffold and resulted in irregular aggregated molecular structures. Further, both CTOHH-DNA and CTOHH were converted into CoWO4-DNA and CoWO4, respectively by annealing them at a temperature of 600 degrees C. All the four catalysts were used for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and for oxidation of aromatic alcohols. In OER, CTOHH-DNA delivered fruitful results compared to all other electrocatalysts. For attaining a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), it just required an overpotential of 355 mV with a Tafel slope value of 47.5 mV dec(-1). Similarly, all four catalysts were also analyzed for selective and controlled oxidation of aromatic alcohols to their respective aldehydes and ketones using molecular oxygen as a green oxidant where CTOHH-DNA showed better results. Chemo-selectivity has been observed for CTOHH-DNA in the co-presence of hydroxyl and cyano functional groups. The durability of CTOHH-DNA was analyzed and it showed excellent catalytic activity retention up to five cycles.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000498690100030	31710074

So far, however the photocatalytic potential of pure-phase nanosized mullite-Bi2Fe4O9 has not been studied. Usually, synthesis of pure-phase nanosized mullite-Bi2Fe4O9 is hampered by co-formation with perovskite BiFeO3. Herein we demonstrate that pure-phase mullite-Bi2Fe4O9 nanoparticles prepared by Flame Spray Pyrolysis (FSP) technology are highly efficient O-2 production photocatalysts, achieving >1500 mu mol g(-1)h(-1). This outperforms all -so far reported- O-2 production Bi-Fe-O photocatalysts. We present an FSP-based process for production of a versatile Bi-Fe-O platform, that can be easily optimized to obtain 100% mullite-Bi2Fe4O9 or 100% perovskite-BiFeO3 or their heterojunctions. The phase-evolution of the Bi-Fe-O materials has been studied by XPS, Raman, and EPR spectroscopies. Short post-FSP annealing process impacts the photoactivity of the BiFeO3 and Bi2Fe4O9 in distinct ways. Fe2+ centers in BiFeO3 can improve dramatically its O-2 production efficiency, while solid-melt formation in Bi2Fe4O9 is a limiting factor.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1996-1073		WOS:000694138700001

Here, a novel Simulation-Experiment-Prediction framework has been conceived to reveal atomic-level ROS evolution mechanisms and screen robust catalysts for Hetero-EF reaction. Dynamics-static calculations unveil that the spontaneous conversion pathway of O-1(2) generation, which elucidate the transformation from *O-2, *HO2, *O-2(-) to *O-1(2), and confirm optimal Co3Fe2-LDH catalysts with lowest rate-determining step and energy barrier (0.82 eV) of O-1(2) generation providing a reasonable and feasible strategy fabricating and tuning Hetero-EF catalysts for realistic contaminants. Subsequently, the Co3Fe2-LDH was verified with best catalytic performance and O-1(2) yield, which increased by exceeding 20% on NFXN decay and the treatment time was shortened similar to 2 h. Machine learning establishes a Gradient Boosting Regressor model for exploring appreciable catalysts for environmental remediation. Our results inspired the exploration and application of quantum chemistry and artificial intelligence for environmental catalysis, remediation and real wastewater purification.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000862807500001

From the voltammetric curves, it was possible to understand that Ti/TiO2-nanotubes/PbO2 electrode has high oxygen evolution overpotential than Ti/Pt anode. A direct electron transfer reaction is attained between the dye molecules and Ti/Pt surface, at lower currents. Conversely, the AR1 oxidation involves water decomposition intermediates, mainly OH radicals at Ti/TiO2-nanotubes/PbO2 anode. The electrolytic process was monitored by the UV-visible spectrometry and the chemical oxygen demand (COD). Results clearly show that Ti/TiO2-nanotubes/PbO2 anode performs better than Ti/TiO2 in removing ARI due to the electrosynthesis of strong oxidants on its surface (OH and persulfates), achieving a higher oxidation rate, higher current efficiency, and less energy consumption than Ti/Pt electrode.									25	0	0	0	6	0	25			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000456744900003

In this study, we report an efficient method to obtain size-controllable Co9S8 derived from metal organic frameworks (MOFs) as a bi-functional catalyst. The particle size of Co9S8 could be finely controlled by tuning the Zn/Co molar ratios in the precursors. The obtained material exhibited optimal performance towards oxygen reactions and zinc-air batteries. The prominent electrochemical properties are mainly ascribed to the synergistic effect of small-sized Co9S8 and the heteroatom-doped carbon matrix.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000490981500019

As one of the attractive means, water splitting has attracted widespread attention because of its great potential in storing electricity in the form of chemical fuel which also makes it a promising solution to the utilization of non-grid electricity generated by solar or wind. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is generally deemed as the key rate-limiting step of water splitting, and thus studying efficient OER electrocatalysts with a low overpotential and good stability is of vital importance. Here, we successfully prepared an OER catalyst with excellent electrochemical performance through a simple anion doping. Firstly, a stable cubic perovskite SrCoO3-delta was prepared by anion F-doping instead of traditional A and/or B site doping. Secondly, SrCoO2.85-deltaF0.15 demonstrates excellent OER activity superior to its parent hexagonal compound H-Sr2Co2O5 and those perovskites prepared via complicated A- and/or B-site doping. DFT calculations and XPS investigations reveal that the cubic structure and the highly oxidative oxygen species (O22-/O-) via F- doping jointly contribute to the better OER properties of SrCoO2.85-deltaF0.15. Our work brings forth a promising strategy to stabilize cubic structures from hexagonal ones via a simple anion doping strategy, which may open a new avenue for the development of even more effective OER catalysts and may be applied in many other fields related to structure transformation, in addition to energy and catalysis fields.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488			INSPEC:20396000

Although lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are traditionally considered to be the most likeliest candidate thanks to their relatively long cycle life and high energy efficiency, their limited energy density as well as cost are still causing a bottleneck for their long-term application. Alternatively, metal-air batteries have been proposed as a very promising large-scale electricity storage technology with the replacement of the intercalation reaction mechanism by the catalytic redox reaction of a light weight metal-oxygen couple. Generally, based on the electrolyte, these metal-air batteries can be divided into aqueous and nonaqueous systems, corresponding to two typical batteries of Zn-air and Li-air, respectively. The prominent feature of both batteries are their extremely high theoretical energy density, especially for nonaqueous Li-air batteries, which far exceeds the best that can be achieved with LIBs. In this review, we focus on the major obstacle of sluggish kinetics of the cathode in both batteries, and summarize the fundamentals and recent advances related to the oxygen catalyst materials. According to the electrolyte, the aqueous and nonaqueous electrocatalytic mechanisms of the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions are discussed. Subsequently, seven groups of oxygen catalysts, which have played catalytic roles in both systems, are selectively reviewed, including transition metal oxides (single-metal oxides and mixed-metal oxides), functional carbon materials (nanostructured carbons and doped carbons), metal oxide-nanocarbon hybrid materials, metal-nitrogen complexes (non-pyrolyzed and pyrolyzed), transition metal nitrides, conductive polymers, and precious metals (alloys). Nonaqueous systems have the advantages of energy density and rechargeability over aqueous systems and have gradually become the research focus of metal-air batteries. However, there are considerable challenges beyond catalysts from aqueous to nonaqueous electrolytes, which are also discussed in this review. Finally, several future research directions are proposed based on the results achieved in this field, with emphasis on nonaqueous Li-air batteries.									1075	60	0	0	33	1	1091			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000343993100015	24056780

Grinding procedures involved in the synthesis of ZIF-8-derived SACs could affect the catalytic performance but are less evaluated in the literature. Herein, a series of ZIF-8-derived cobalt SACs (C-Co-ZIFs) with different grinding processes to investigate the impact of the grinding degrees on the performance of the electrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 (ECO2RR) is presented. The moderate grinding process affords a boost in CO Faradaic efficiency (FE, around 15% higher than that of the original C-Co-ZIF) and the highest current densities among all the samples. The variations in the electronic structure of the Co active sites in the ground catalysts are confirmed by X-Ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-Ray emission spectroscopy (XES) for improved catalytic performance. The increased micropores in the moderately ground catalyst provide more exposed active sites while the increased meso- and macropores promote the mass transfer, benefiting the ECO2RR performance. It suggests that the impact of grinding processes on the synthesis of ZIF-8-derived SACs should be considered for the evaluation of the catalytic performance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2688-4062		WOS:000788809300001

Nickel and cobalt hydroxide layers were formed by varying the deposition potential at the same time intervals (-1.15V for Ni(OH)(2) and -0.85V for Co(OH)(2)). An electrolyte bath containing 0.05M Ni(NO3)(2), 0.05M Co(NO3)(2), and 0.1M KNO3 was used for the electrodeposition. Structural analysis confirmed the formation of a spinel NiCo2O4 after thermal treatment. The influence of annealing temperature in the range of 473-1073K on the films activity in OER has been investigated using 0.1M NaOH. Nickel-cobalt oxide coatings demonstrated OER activity close to the benchmark IrO2 with the onset potential value of +1.6 (vs. RHE), overpotential of 530mV at 10mAcm(-2), and Tafel slope of 49mVdec(-1).

Previous MOF-template route to targeting Co-electrocatalysts relies mainly on regular Co-MOFs particles, and how to obtain hybrid Co-electrocatalysts with adjustable compositions is still challenging. Here we present a facile route to obtain hybrid Co-electrocatalysts with tunable compositions by impregnating different amount of Co2+ ions in common Fe-MOF particles followed by a calcination process. Four different Co-based electrocatalysts with regular porous structures have been developed and their OER activities are investigated. Among them, metallic Co-containing composite electrocatalysts (Co/CoO/CoFe2O4) exhibit both HER and OER activity, and they are applicable to overall water splitting. This work shares a new strategy to achieve porous Co-based composite electrocatalysts and a simple route to tailor their compositions and activities. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

From the data analysis it was found that an increase in temperature of the electrolyte caused a significant lowering of the overpotential in the range from 152 to 260 mV at 100 mA/cm(2). Alloys with high Cu contents CN706 had the best kinetic performance for OER in the low currents region as compared with the other alloys tested (Tafel slope of 59 mV/dc).

Non-precious metal catalysts such as Fe-N-C catalysts are available for ORR at the cathode in alkaline electrolytes. But at the anode, the catalytic reaction kinetics of Pt catalysts in alkaline media is two orders of magnitude slower than that in acid media, which prompts researchers to develop new low-cost and high-efficient non-precious metal catalysts for HOR. Up to date, the typical non-precious metal catalysts for HOR are Ni-based materials. In this minireview, we firstly introduced the elementary steps of HOR and the important activity parameters for a HOR catalyst.

Here we facilely synthesized nitrogen doped carbon nanotube by pyrolyzing melamine formaldehyde resin and Fe loading on MgO. There were mainly three morphologies observed, slender bamboo-like CNT, thick bamboo-like CNT, surface smooth, hollow CNT. The content of Fe loading on MgO had little influence on morphologies of CNT, however, when no MgO as support, only carbon ribbon obtained. The MgO as support was also significant for the formation of CNT. The samples with CNT formed represented better catalytic activity than control samples with no-CNT obtained, the morphology of CNT was beneficial for catalytic process. The sample C-l-CNT with lowest content of Fe on support represented best catalytic activity which was competitive with 20% PtiC in half-wave potential. The C1-CNT also showed outstanding stability and improved selectivity towards ORR, making it a promising alternative to Pt in application of fuel cells and metal-air batteries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of doping metal Ni is to adjust the electronic structure of the MoSe2/Ti2NTx heterojunction effectively and further improve the Ni-MoSe2/Ti2NTx catalytic activity. Therefore, the Ni-MoSe2/Ti2NTx catalyst in alkaline media exhibits excellent catalytic and synergistic effects in terms of the activities of both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). In short, Ni-MoSe2/Ti2NTx exhibits overpotential as low as 92 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope (79.7 mV dec(-1)) for HER performance in alkaline media. In terms of OER performance, Ni-MoSe2/Ti2NTx displays remarkable overpotential (270 mV at 50 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope (81.1 mV dec(-1)). In overall water splitting configuration, Ni -MoSe2/Ti2NTx electrodes used as bifunctional electrocatalysts only need 1.59 V at 10 mA cm(-2). The Ni -MoSe2/Ti2NTx heterostructure engineering with excellent durability is instructive to the overall water splitting configuration (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Cai, Ting; Liu, Zhe; Yuan, Jing; Xu, Peng; Zhao, Kunfeng; Tong, Qin; Lu, Wenquan; He, Dannong								The structural evolution of MnOx with calcination temperature and their catalytic performance for propane total oxidation								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				565						150596	10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.150596		JUL 2021		NOV 1 2021	2021	Manganese oxide is one of the most active transition oxides catalysts and widely applied in various reactions due to its structure diversity. Especially in VOCs oxidation, it usually exhibited excellent performance. The systematic study on structure evolution with catalytic performance is rare. Here, we prepared a series of MnOx by calcinating 8-MnO2 at different temperatures, and investigated their catalytic performance for propane total oxidation. Both of the crystalline phase and morphology presented obvious changes as the calcination temperature elevation from room temperature to 900 degrees C. It changed from 8-MnO2 to alpha-MnO2 and then Mn2O3 with the morphology from sphere-like gradually to nanoplates and/or nanorods. The activation capacity of alpha-MnO2 is proved to be slightly better than 8-MnO2 and much better than Mn2O3 for propane total oxidation. Abundant subsurface lattice oxygen in alpha-MnO2 facilitated propane total oxidation to react more easily, while better reducibility contributed more to the comparable activity of 8-MnO2, and to the slightly lower activity of Mn2O3. The present research will gain deep insight on the structure and application of Mn-based materials in VOCs removal.									4	1	0	0	1	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000681209200004

Herein, ultrathin MoSSe alloy nanosheets array on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to form a core shell structure via a simple solvothermal process. These three-dimensional (3D) MoSSe hybrids show a high activity in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a small Tafel slope of 38 mV dec(-1) and a low overpotential of 102 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, their HER activity remains remarkably stable without significant decay after 100 h polarization. Such superior catalytic HER activity springs from the 3D hierarchical heterostructure, which is abundant of catalytic edge sites, and the alloy effect between S and Se, which will create huge defects and strain to form vacancy sites on the basal plane. This strategy may open a new avenue toward the development of nonprecious high-performance HER catalysts. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A combined photoemission and X-ray absorption spectroscopic study reveals that Fe doping introduces more occupied Fe 3d(6) states at the top of the valence band and thereby induces a metallic phase. Meanwhile, Fe doping also significantly increases the OER activity and results in much better stability with the optimum found for Fe0.1Ni0.9S2. More importantly, we performed detailed characterization to track the evolution of the structure and composition of the catalysts after different cycles of OER testing. Our results further confirmed that the catalysts gradually transform into amorphous (oxy)hydroxides which are the actual active species for the OER. However, a fast phase transformation in NiS2 is accompanied by a decrease of OER activity, because of the formation of a thick insulating NiOOH layer limiting electron transfer. On the other hand, Fe doping retards the process of transformation, because of a shorter Fe-S bond length (2.259 angstrom) than Ni-S (2.400 angstrom), explaining the better electrochemical stability of Fe0.1Ni0.9S2. These results suggest that the formation of a thin surface layer of NiFe (oxy)hydroxide as an active OER catalyst and the remaining Fe0.1Ni0.9S2 as a conductive core for fast electron transfer is the base for the high OER activity of FexNi1-xS2. Our work provides important insight and design principle for metal chalcogenides as highly active OER catalysts.									38	4	0	0	4	0	38			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000506883100013	31782464

The present report describes the development of a hemispherical cavity cobalt (Co) electrocatalyst with uniform pores with sizes of several hundred nanometers on the surface via electrodeposition on an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate in a carbonate electrolyte solution using a polystyrene particle template. Catalytic activity measurements indicated that the cavity Co catalyst generated a greater oxygen evolution current compared to the flat Co catalyst. To investigate the electronic state and local structure, operando Co K-edge XAFS measurements of the cavity Co catalyst were obtained under working conditions, which showed that Co species in the catalyst changed to one with a higher oxidation number while maintaining the local structure of CoOOH (CoO6). These results clarified that the cavity Co catalyst efficiently promoted water splitting through the uniform nanoscale pores with high oxidation Co in the CoOOH structure.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2365-6549			WOS:000834121400001

Herein, we develop a rapid and facile route to synthesize CuO NPs- and C, N-codoped g-C3N4 nanosheets grown on Ni foil (CuO/CN-C3N4/Ni-f), derived from the oxidation-pyrolysis of melamine-entrapped Cu(II)-MOF gel in the air. A detailed growth process for the hierarchical structure is studied. The obtained hierarchical structure without any binders used directly as an electrode only needs an overpotential of 223 mV to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M KOH, implying its highly efficient electrocatalytic activity. Notably, this material also exhibits strong long-term durability. Free energy calculations show that the intrinsic origin of the outstanding activity is derived from sufficient exposure of active sites for CuO NPs anchored on the nanosheets and high N content.									6	1	0	0	1	0	6			2199-692X			WOS:000480040000001

Assisting by the unique supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) technique, NiFe2O4 nanoparticles are directly anchored on the vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNT). The integrated hybrid electrocatalyst of NiFe2O4/VACNT demonstrates remarkable catalytic activities for both OER and HER. It requires overpotentials of only 240 mV and 150 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) anodic and cathodic current densities, respectively. Such excellent performance is credited to the synergistic effect raising from the interaction of tiny NiFe2O4 particles and VACNT, which provides highly exposed catalytic sites, fast charge transport, excellent reactant diffusion and interface infiltration. This work not only provides an effective technique to prepare efficient electrocatalyst for overall water splitting but also offers important understandings in nanostructure engineering for rational design functional materials in multidisciplinary application including energy conversion.

Herein we report a two-step synthesis of uniform hollow nickel cobalt perselenide nanostructured microparticles with a corrugated surface, randomly spaced pores, and a tunable composition. In the first step, we synthesized Ni-Co acetate hydroxide prism shaped microparticles, which were subsequently used as templates for the selenization process at temperatures as low as 80 degrees C. The substitution of acetate and hydroxide anions with selenide anions at a low temperature eventually produced partially amorphous hollow microparticles due to the nanoscale Kirkendall effect. Thin films of the as-synthesized samples behaved as highly active catalysts for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Among those, Ni0.88Co1.22Se4 hollow microparticles showed excellent performances, exhibiting a 10 mA/cm(2) current density at a modest overpotential of 320 mV, a high turnover frequency of 0.146 S1-, and a long-term operational stability (over 100 h of continuous operation).									74	5	0	0	1	0	75			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000408519800051

Carbon-free, sustainable, alternative energy technologies have therefore become the prime focus of current research. Smart inorganic materials have emerged as the potential solution to suffice energy needs and remediate the organic pollutants discharged to the environment. One such promising, versatile material is FeCo2O4 which has gained immense research interest in the present decade due to its high efficiency and performance in energy and environmental applications. Innovative material design strategies involving the interplay of nanostructured morphology, chemical composition, redox surface states, and defect engineering have significantly enhanced both electrochemical and catalytic properties of FeCo2O4. Therefore, this review article aims to provide the first-ever comprehensive account of the latest research and developments in design-synthesis strategies, characterization techniques, and applications of nanostructured FeCo2O4 and its composites in various electrochemical as well as catalytic applications. A detailed account of the nanostructured FeCo2O4 and its composites in various energy storage and conversion devices such as supercapacitors (SCs), batteries, and fuel cells has been presented. Furthermore, a special section has been devoted to highlight the role of FeCo2O4 in enhancing the sluggish reaction kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in water splitting application.

The preparation process study shows that the beta-PbO2 bath containing WC particles becomes more stable for an ultrasonic dispersion time within 30 minutes. WC particles in the beta-PbO2 bath are positively charged, with anions being adsorbed onto the particles. Compared to the beta-PbO2 composite electrode, the oxygen evolution overpotentials for the beta-PbO2-WC electrode are decreased, which demonstrates an energy-saving effect. The nucleation behavior study shows that the co-deposition of WC particles into the layer has little effect on the crystal growth of beta-PbO2. The main process during the deposition time of 0-5 min were the nucleation of the beta-PbO2 grains, the adsorption of WC particles, growth of beta-PbO2 grains, and WC particles coated.									1	1	0	0	0	0	1			1452-3981			WOS:000467818200032

In this work, for the first time, uniformly sized molybdenum/tungsten diselenide and cadmium disulfide nanohybrid quantum dots (MoSe2:CdS and WSe2:CdS NHDs) have been synthesized by a simple hydrothermal technique. The highly exfoliated and defect-abundant nanostructure possess abundant active sites and therefore shows bifunctional behavior with high catalytic activity towards the oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). The WSe2:CdS NHDs exhibit a small onset potential of + 1.1 V vs. RHE and -0.26 V with a small Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1) and 27 mV dec(-1) for OER and ORR, respectively. Moreover, having a quantum sized structure along with CdS also made the NHDs a promising and biocompatible fluorescent probe for metal ion (Pb2+) analysis. The PL emission from NHDs is of high energy and is more intense than the bare NDs, with a very good quantum yield of 87%. The prepared NHDs show a highly stable fluorescence and NHDs coated paper strips were successfully implemented for trace level (20.0 mu g L-1) analysis of Pb2+ in real samples (human blood, urine, and polluted water). However, the NHDs were also employed for ultra-trace level (500.0 ng L-1) detection of Pb2+, which confirm the highly selective, sensitive and multi-functional behavior of the prepared NHDs. Therefore, it is envisaged that this work may provide a simple route to synthesize multi-talented 2D layered nanodots suitabile for imaging, sensing, and other energy-related technologies.									21	0	0	0	2	0	21			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000395072800020

In the meantime, transition metal oxides and sulfides have been widely used in environmental and energy conversion applications. Hence, a NaOH-assisted thioacetamide etching strategy is, therefore, designed with the metal-organic framework as precursor to realize the hollow nanostructure of ZIF bimetallic sulfide (S-x-CoCd-350) with abundant sulfur vacancies for enhanced catalysts oxygen evolution reaction (OER)/hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)) performance and capacitance performance of capacitor.

As an electrocatalyst, the 0.8%Fe-Ni0.85Se nanosheets array only required a small overpotential of 120 mV and a Tafel slope of 34.11 mV dec(-1) to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER. The 2%Fe-Ni0.85Se nanosheets array can provide a large current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 1.54 V and a Tafel slope of 73.40 mV dec(-1) for the OER.

In this work, the carbon wrapped bimetallic NiCo nanospheres were prepared via a simple annealing process. Furthermore, the effect of different molar ratio of Ni:Co on the electrocatalytic properties of the obtained samples were investigated. Among these obtained catalysts, sample (with the molar ratio of Ni:Co was 1:2) exhibited the best electrocatalytic performance both for HER and OER. Electrochemical analysis showed that the overpotentials were only 105 and 330 mV for HER and OER to reach a catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. The corresponding Cdl (electric double-layer capacitance) value can reach up to 17.1 mF cm(-2). What is more, the I -t-tests were carried out to prove its superior long-term catalytic durability. It was demonstrated that the excellent properties of HER and OER can be attributed to the large Cdl of the sample, the optimized molar ratio of NiCo alloy as well as the improved stability and electron transfer efficiency via carbon coating. The schematic diagrams have been provided to better understand the possible formation process and electrocatalytic mechanism. In brief, this work could provide a feasible and simple route for the design of bimetallic-based electrode materials toward superior HER and OER performance. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

This paper thoroughly investigates the microstructural and microchemical evolutions that take place in such conditions. Two zirconium-based alloys and unalloyed zirconium were pre-charged with hydrogen at various contents up to 3300 wppm and heat-treated at 1000 or 850 degrees C. Neutron diffraction analyses were performed in situ upon slow cooling from 700 degrees C and at room temperature. In the materials containing 3300 wppm of hydrogen, beta(Zr) progressively transforms into alpha(Zr) during slow cooling then extensively transforms into alpha(Zr) and delta(ZrH2-x) hydrides precipitate via a eutectoid reaction. Thermodynamic predictions at equilibrium are in good agreement with the experimental results. However, depending on the cooling scenario and the average hydrogen content, the precipitation of gamma(ZrH) hydrides, potentially metastable, is evidenced below 350 degrees C and a significant amount of hydrogen can remain in solid solution in alpha(Zr). These metallurgical evolutions and the evolution of the different phase lattice parameters are strongly influenced by the partitioning of oxygen and hydrogen (revealed by electron probe and elastic recoil detection microanalyses) that occurs during the beta(Zr) to alpha(Zr) transformation and hydride precipitation.

Here, a facile solution reduction method is demonstrated for mesoporous Co3O4 nanowires treated with NaBH4. The high-surface-area mesopore feature leads to efficient surface reduction in solution at room temperature, which allows for retention of the nanowire morphology and 1D charge transport behavior, while at the same time substantially increasing the oxygen vacancies on the nanowire surface. Compared to pristine Co3O4 nanowires, the reduced Co3O4 nanowires exhibit a much larger current of 13.1 mA cm(-2) at 1.65 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a much lower onset potential of 1.52 V vs RHE. Electrochemical supercapacitors based on the reduced Co3O4 nanowires also show a much improved capacitance of 978 F g(-1) and reduced charge transfer resistance. Density-functional theory calculations reveal that the existence of oxygen vacancies leads to the formation of new gap states in which the electrons previously associated with the Co-O bonds tend to be delocalized, resulting in the much higher electrical conductivity and electrocatalytic activity.									493	26	0	0	20	0	499			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000345314800010

The family of transition-metal chalcogenides, especially cobalt disulfide (CoS2), has been reported as competitive ORR catalysts. Here, we perform a detailed analysis of the intrinsic activity in terms of onset potentials and selectivity toward hydrogen peroxide of CoS2 in both acid and alkaline medium. Our detailed characterizations of this system via X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and calculated bulk and surface thermodynamics and ORR mechanism reveal pH-dependent electrochemical evolution of the CoS2 surfaces. Using XPS results before and after ORR in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations for individual surfaces reveals sulfur to oxygen substitution, and partial dissolution occurs in acidic media, while thin cobalt oxide films supported by CoS2 are formed in alkaline media. The comprehensive DFT calculations of the ORR activities on these systems reveal that sulfur is an unlikely ORR active site, while undercoordinated Co metal site in the CoS2 is less active than very active undercoordinated Co metal site in the Co oxide film. Using these guiding principles, we then demonstrate that electrochemical lithium (Li) tuning of CoS2 in organic electrolyte increases its ORR performance in both acid and alkaline medium. Detailed characterizations demonstrate that the grain size of CoS2 particle is considerably reduced and has a much richer surface oxygen content after electrochemical Li tuning (LiET-CoS2) as the direct consequence of the Li galvanostatic cycling. The general efficacy of this method toward transition-metal chalcogenides (T-M-X) is further demonstrated by enhanced ORR activities of CoS and Ni3S2 in alkaline and neutral medium, respectively. This work opens up an opportunity for probing more advanced T-M-X-based catalysts.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			2574-0962			WOS:000504953500030

To the best of our knowledge, however, such a surface defect engineering strategy for sulfide photocatalysts has rarely been verified. The present work shows the first case of employing pressure hydrogenation to prepare hydrogenated ZnIn2S4 (H-ZIS) microspheres with surface-deficient porous structures, which are favorable for furnishing sufficient surface sulfur vacancies to realize excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions. The hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of H-ZIS is as high as 1.9 mmol h(-1) g(-1) (nearly 8.6 times that of the pristine ZIS sample), which rivals or exceeds those of previously-reported ZIS-based photocatalysts under visible light irradiation. Meanwhile, the inherent correlation between surface sulfur vacancies and photocatalytic activities of H-ZIS is also explored. Thus, this work demonstrates the feasibility of enhancing the hydrogen evolution capability of sulfide photocatalysts by the formation of sulfur vacancies through a pressure hydrogenation process.									35	2	0	0	3	0	35			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000506841300060	31714570

Unlike traditional single-source modification, herein a novel pomegranate-like high-entropy (HE) elec-trocatalyst of Ni3ZnC0.7 decorated with homogeneous multimetal (Fe, Co, Cu, and Ni) nitrogen-codoped carbon matrix (Ni3ZnC0.7@CoNiCuFe-NC) is reported. It can be implemented by the simple thermal annealing method of multimetal codoped zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF). Benefiting from the syn-ergistic effects of plentiful TM-N-C species, template effect of ZIF and distinct nanoporous structure, HE electrocatalyst Ni3ZnC0.7@CoNiCuFe-NC exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performance. When ap-plied in strong alkaline electrolyte (1.0 M KOH), the overpotentials of Ni3ZnC0.7@CoNiCuFe-NC present as low as 202 and 97 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at 10 mA cm(-2) current density. Surprisingly as a bifunctional electrode, it can achieve the low cell voltage of 1.53 V at 10 mA cm -2 current density for overall water splitting, which is comparable to conventional IrO2||Pt/C electrode and superior to the recently reported analogous bifunctional catalysts. Thus, the work proposes the direction for the rational design of homogeneous distribution of TM-N-C material for water splitting in the green hydrogen energy industry.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The editorial office of Journal of Materials Science & Technology.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1005-0302	1941-1162		WOS:000860675100003

In this paper, brush-like Ni-Co-M (M = O, S, Se and P) samples on three-dimensional (3D) hierarchically porous nickel foams (NF) were synthesized via thermolysis, sulfuration, selenylation and phosphorization, respectively, of the Ni-Co-precursor under an Ar atmosphere. Ni-Co-S/NF demonstrated an overpotential of 270 mV@40 mA cm(-2) toward the OER and Ni-Co-P/NF demonstrated one of 156 mV@10 mA cm(-2) toward the HER in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. What's more, considering the beneficial superior activity of Ni-Co-S/NF for the OER and Ni-Co-P/NF for the HER, an electrode pairing of Ni-Co-S-OER//Ni-Co-P-HER was assembled for overall water splitting and the result was that only 1.57 V was needed to afford a current density of 20 mA cm(-2). Ni-Co-S//Ni-Co-P also demonstrated long-term durability during a 20 h stability test without obvious deactivation in 1.0 M KOH. The novelty of choosing the highest activity catalyst for the OER and HER from Ni-Co-M (M = O, S, Se and P) to construct a well-matched electrode pair and thus enhance the overall water splitting performance presents a wide range of possibilities for the further development of earth-abundant and highly efficient electrode pairs.									80	4	0	0	1	0	80			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000437469300033

Sealing effect of the glass-based top-coat and reactive elemental effect of Hf facilitated the formation of columnar alpha-Al2O3 at 1050degC. Furthermore, a discontinuous gahnite interlayer formed at the alpha-Al2O3/top-coat interface due to interfacial reactions. However, because of the discontinuous microstructure of gahnite, the alpha-Al2O3 suffered durative attack by the active glass matrix, which caused severe internal oxidation of Hf and Al within the bond-coat. In addition, the oxygen barrier ability of the top-coat changed with its microstructure evolution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-7820			INSPEC:17275381

In these so-called "crown-jewel" (CJ) structures, Pt atoms (jewels) occupy the vertex sites of the metal nanocluster (crown) surface. We investigated the thermal stability and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activity of these catalysts. The results reveal that CJ-structured PtCu nanoclusters are stable and possess a comparable or even better ORR activity compared to Pt catalyst, making it a promising candidate for low-cost ORR catalysts. The effect of cluster size on the adsorption strength of ORR intermediates and catalytic property has also been studied. Furthermore, the overall ORR catalytic activity trend of these SACs is explained based on analysis of their electronic properties. A descriptor psi was established to provide further insight into the correlation between the electronic structure and catalytic activity, which provides a design strategy for new ORR catalysts. More importantly, we reveal that this electronic descriptor can be extended to predict other CJ-structured nanoclusters.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000801137000007

At all temperatures, two linear E-log i relations are established. In the high current density (cd) region, Tafel slopes at all temperatures are close to 120 mV, i.e., they are invariant with temperature, and the symmetry factor increases with temperature according to beta = beta(S)T with beta(S) = 1.6 X 10(-3) K-1. In the low cd region, Tafel slopes at all temperatures are close to 60 mV; i.e., they are also invariant with temperature. The transfer coefficient in the latter region increases with temperature according to alpha = alpha(S)T with alpha(S) = 8 X 10(-4) K-1. It is shown that, in both cd regions, entropy of activation decreases with electrode potential and temperature. The significance of the kinetics when beta = beta(S)T and alpha = alpha(S)T is discussed.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0022-3654			WOS:A1993LX92300018

To illuminate this history, we examined the behavior of the ancient Mn cycle using newly obtained scientific drill cores through an early Paleoproterozoic succession (2.415 Ga) preserved in South Africa. These strata contain substantial Mn enrichments (up to similar to 17 wt %) well before those associated with the rise of oxygen such as the similar to 2.2 Ga Kalahari Mn deposit. Using microscale X-ray spectroscopic techniques coupled to optical and electron microscopy and carbon isotope ratios, we demonstrate that the Mn is hosted exclusively in carbonate mineral phases derived from reduction of Mn oxides during diagenesis of primary sediments. Additional observations of independent proxies for O-2-multiple S isotopes (measured by isotope-ratio mass spectrometry and secondary ion mass spectrometry) and redox-sensitive detrital grains-reveal that the original Mn-oxide phases were not produced by reactions with O-2, which points to a different high-potential oxidant. These results show that the oxidative branch of the Mn cycle predates the rise of oxygen, and provide strong support for the hypothesis that the water-oxidizing complex of photosystem II evolved from a former transitional photosystem capable of single-electron oxidation reactions of Mn.									141	6	1	0	67	0	149			0027-8424			WOS:000321827000025	23798417

However, the known active sites are limited to edges and one primitive cell missing vacancies. Herein, the potential catalytic activities of five types of vacancies in the inert basal plane of MoS2 are investigated by using first-principle density functional theory (DFT) calculations. two types of vacancies (VMo and VMoS2) are found to have the promising catalytic activities for the splitting of H2O and have the comparable or even better catalytic activities for the HER, in compared with the precious platinum. Our theoretical works suggest that formation of the specified vacancy defects on the inert basal plane will enhance the catalytic activities of MoS2 for the dissociation of H2O and the HER, which improves the efficiency of hydrogen production.

The exposure to molecular oxygen induces graphene changes as evidenced by a blue-shift of the G and 2D Raman bands, together with the decrease of I-2D/I-G intensity ratio, which are consistent with a high p-type doping (similar to 10(13) cm(-2)) of graphene. The successive thermal treatment in vacuum does not affect the induced doping showing this latter stability. By investigating the temperature range 140-350 degrees C and the process time evolution, the thermal properties of this doping procedure are characterized, and an activation energy of similar to 56 meV is estimated. These results are interpreted on the basis of molecular oxygen induced similar to 10(13) cm(-2) p-type doping of graphene with stability energy >49 meV and postdoping reactivity in ambient atmosphere due to reaction of air molecules with oxygen trapped between graphene and substrate.									36	2	0	0	0	0	36			1932-7447			WOS:000362385700053

Associated with the low temperature (50-150-degrees-C) oxidation of the coal is the chemisorption of oxygen and the emission of CO and H2O. This process is accompanied by residual gas evolution, mainly CO and low molecular weight hydrocarbons. Low temperature simulations in the laboratory (50-150-degrees-C) have shown that an appreciable amount of molecular hydrogen, H-2 (few hundred ppm volume), is also evolved. Flow reactor thermogravimetric analysis of the low temperature coal oxidation process has been performed with two different bituminous coals; one from Northern Appalachia in the USA, and the other from the Ruhr Basin of Germany. It has been observed that the emission of H-2 occurs at temperatures as low as 50-degrees-C and that, as has been previously suggested, this reaction is an oxidation correlated process. Furthermore the emission of H-2 is a fast process, occurring within a few minutes from the onset of heating the coal sample. Prior to the evolution of the aforementioned gases, an increase in the coal sample weight is observed due to oxygen chemisorption. The mechanism and a parameter study is discussed in detail.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			0016-2361			WOS:A1994NJ67300021

The ATM modified Au electrode catalyses the evolution of H-2 from water even in the presence of O-2 and other inhibitors. Moreover, water insoluble iron-porphyrins get immobilised on this construct through physiadsorption and thus it becomes a favourable ORR (O-2 reduction reaction) catalyst. A naturally occurring peptide Ay(1-19), containing native cysteine residues, spontaneously forms an ordered SAM (self-assembled monolayer) on Au and upon heme binding this construct can catalyse the ORR with a higher catalytic rate compared to synthetic metallo-porphyrin based ORR catalysts. Human A beta(1-16), appended with a cysteine residue at its C-terminus, gets readily immobilised on Au surfaces by SAM formation. These A beta(Cys) constructs represent different isoforms of A beta in the absence and in the presence of various coadsorbant thiols. Upon individual as well as simultaneous binding of heme and Cu, these structurally different A beta(Cys) constructs exhibit diverse trends in generating oxidative stress, in vitro.									8	1	0	0	1	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000423466100002

However, little is known about how the composition and structure of such overlayers impact the properties and performance of the underlying electrocatalyst. The results presented herein demonstrate that the density and carbon content of carbon-modified silicon oxide (SiOxCy) overlayers can be systematically varied using a room-temperature photochemical conversion process to precisely control the flux of protons and molecular oxygen (O-2) to the buried interface of an encapsulated platinum electrode. Correlations between species permeabilities, overlayer composition, and overlayer structure show that proton transport is greatly enhanced as the carbon content decreases and overlayer density increases, while the inverse trend is observed for O-2. These observations are found to be consistent with O-2 diffusing through the free volume in the SiOxCy matrix, while proton diffusion proceeds through a facilitated transport mechanism associated with the hydrogen bond network of silicon oxide moieties. Importantly, this study indicates that overlayer composition can be a potentially powerful control knob for tuning the fluxes of redox species to active sites as well as modifying local properties at electrocatalytic buried interfaces.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2574-0962			WOS:000618839200089

Herein, a novel Fe-N-C catalyst (ZIF/MIL-10-900) is derived from a mixture of ZIF-8 and MIL-101(Fe) and atomically dispersed FeN4 structures are confirmed by Mossbauer spectra and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Study on the pyrolysis procedure reveals that Fe atoms in FeN4 are from MIL-101(Fe), while ZIF-8 acts as structural support and nitrogen sources. The as-prepared catalyst demonstrates a comparable ORR activity with the commercial Pt/ C possessing a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.78 V in acids, in combination with excellent methanol tolerance and stability. One of the highest peak power density of 83 mW cm(-2) in DMFC (3 M CH3OH) by adopting ZIF/MIL-10-900 as cathode catalyst is obtained, which is 2.8-fold higher than that of the commercial Pt/C in the same operating condition.									72	5	0	0	1	0	72			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000488308800052

This O* mechanism predicted reasonable ORR half-wave potential (E-1/2) of Co/N/C but abnormally underestimated the one of Fe/N/C. Herein, we highlight an unconventional 2OH* ORR mechanism (O-2 -> OOH* -> 2OH* -> OH* -> H2O), which was often ignored because the free energies (Delta G) of 2OH* and O* are equal, according to the famous scaling relation: 2 Delta G(OH*) = Delta G(O*). This scaling relation is true for traditional catalysts with near-continuous active sites. We find a different scaling relation: Delta G(2OH*) = Delta G(O*) + 1.5 eV on single-atom catalysts (Me/N/C, Me = Fe, Co, etc.) and suggest that the 2OH* mechanism should not be overlooked. In consideration of both O* and 2OH* mechanisms, the ORR E-1/2 values of Co/N/C and Fe/N/C are in good agreement with experimental results. This work reveals the structure dependence of ORR reaction mechanisms and scaling relations in single-atom catalysis, and it is also heuristic for other reactions, such as O-2 evolution and N-2 reduction on single-atom catalysts.									59	4	0	0	0	0	61			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000034

US layers grown by both chemical bath deposition (CBD) and CSS provide a basis for determining the effects of CdS crystallinity, grain size, and oxygen content on the subsequent CdTe layer. As-grown CBD US films exhibit small grains and variations in optical properties attributed to film impurities. In contrast, CSS yields CdS films with good crystallinity, larger grains, and nearly ideal optical properties. The hexagonal nature of CSS-grown US is seen to nucleate hexagonal CdTe during the initial stages of CdTe film growth. Cubic US deposited by CBD in contrast promotes cubic CdTe nucleation. Oxygen anneals in the latter case can aid hexagonal CdTe nucleation. Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the CdS/CdTe interface show CdS-dependent differences in interdiffusion at the interface. This interdiffusion appears to be determined by the oxygen level in the CdS. When low-oxygen-containing CSS CdS films are used, sulfur diffusion is substantial, leading to significant consumption of the US layer. When these same films are annealed in oxygen, the consumption is reduced. Te diffusion into the US layer is also observed to decrease with oxygen anneals. Optical modeling shows that Te alloying with the US layer can greatly reduce the short-circuit current of CdS/CdTe devices.

We demonstrate for the first time the use of the pulsed laser rusting strategy for transmuting stainless steel (SS) into an active electrode that is used as an energy storage system of supercapacitors (SCs) and as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, a bare stainless steel (denoted as BARE-SS) electrode is rusted on a single side (denoted as SSLR-SS) and on double sides (represented as DSLR-SS) by means of a Nd:YAG laser pulse. The unique honey-comb texture of highly conductive Fe-Cr-Ni oxide/oxyhydroxide rust layers causes a shorter diffusion path for electrons and ions. Therefore, the as-rusted electrodes possess preferred electrochemically active sites enabling the effective contact between them and the electrolyte (1 M KOH). The electrochemical measurements reveal that compared with the BARE-SS and SSLR-SS electrodes, the DSLR-SS electrode unveils improved capacitive behavior, including satisfactory areal capacitance (22 mu F cm(-2) at 5 mV s(-1)). Meanwhile, the DSLR-SS electrode has concurrently performed well as an electrocatalyst for the OER and can attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 382 mV with a Tafel slope of 52 mV dec(-1). These findings shed light on the economic pathway to prepare pulsed laser rusted metallic alloys and to handle multifunctional challenges in the field of energy.									8	1	0	0	0	0	9			2398-4902			WOS:000518690900025

Unique architecture constructed with two-dimensional (2D) holey nanosheets provides high exposure of active sites and benefits mass transport of electrolyte, which is favorable for OER electrocatalysis. Holey structure maintains through the structural conversion from NiNH to gamma-NiOOH during OER activation. The vertically aligned gamma-NiOOH porous nanosheet arrays exhibit tight adhesion on NF and sufficient Ni2+/Ni3+ redox species, which guarantee OER activity and durable stability. Optimal OER activity with overpotential of 231 mV at 50 mA/cm(2), a Tafel slope of 123 mV/dec and a good stability can be achieved in 1 M KOH solution, which is superior to most previous reported transition metal-based electrocatalysts. Our work can provide a facile strategy to obtain highly efficient holey OER electrocatalysts. Graphic Abstract									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000704056800001

Worm				2	2			e23415	e23415		10.4161/worm.23415				2013-Apr-01	2013	The nematode exoskeleton, commonly called the cuticle, is a highly structured extracellular matrix mainly composed of collagen. Secreted collagen molecules from the underlying epidermal cells are cross-linked via their tyrosyl residues. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are required for the cross-linking reaction to produce tyrosyl radicals. The conserved ROS generator enzyme in C. elegans, BLI-3/CeDUOX1, a homolog of dual oxidases (DUOXs), is responsible for production of hydrogen peroxide. The ROS generation system must be properly controlled since ROS are highly reactive molecules that irreversibly inhibit the functions of cellular components such as nucleic acids and proteins. We recently reported that the ROS generation system directed by BLI-3 requires the tetraspanin protein, TSP-15. Herein we outline the process of cuticle development with a focus on the molecular roles of TSP-15 in the BLI-3 system. We also propose the co-occurrence of tetraspanin and ROS generators by convergent evolution.									8	0	0	0	8	0	10			2162-4046			MEDLINE:24058871	24058871

We find the strength weakens with the metal coordination number. Low-coordinated Ni sites, i.e. single-coordinated Ni on the zigzag edge, exhibit the highest activity toward HER, while high-coordinated Ni atoms, i.e. quadruple-coordinated Ni, demonstrate the best OER performance. This assumption has been further confirmed by a wide range of transition metals, including Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, and Pd. Our findings highlight a new family of efficient bifunctional catalysts for water splitting and offer a new paradigm for the design of single-atom HER/OER catalysts toward hydrogen production.									68	3	0	0	0	0	68			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000427152800007

Focused almost entirely on pushing the boundaries of intrinsic activity, electrocatalytic material development often overlooks stability. Operating in parallel to the typical mechanisms of electrochemical material degradation, three-dimensional nanomaterials are susceptible to an additional degradation process known as coarsening. Driven by the reduction of surface free energy, surface diffusion evolves the nano porous morphology toward a solid spherical particle. Here, using nanoporous NiPt alloy nanopartides (np-NiPt/C) as a representative three-dimensional electrocatalytic material, we demonstrate that coarsening is the dominant mechanism of degradation as observed during accelerated durability testing (ADT). The upper potential limit (UPL) of the ADT protocol is found to have a significant impact on coarsening, with the rate roughly scaling with the UPL. Here we demonstrate the viability of a methodology to limit the coarsening process by decoration of the surface with a foreign metal impurity, Ir, possessing a surface diffusivity lower than that of the catalytic species. Ir, present in a low coverage with negligible impact on the intrinsic activity, dramatically slows morphology evolution. This strategy is shown to result in significant improvements in the electrochemically active surface area and transition metal alloying component retention up to a UPL of 1.1 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. This proof-of-concept result demonstrates the utility of this strategy for improving the balance between activity and stability for three-dimensional electrocatalytic nanomaterials with potential application to a broad range of nanoscale geometries and compositions.									27	1	0	0	0	0	27			2155-5435			WOS:000414724700073

However, their kinetics and energetics require further development to achieve an efficient OER performance. Herein, we report a facile strategy for modulating the OER kinetics and energetics of high-oxidation-state active metals by incorporating a low-oxidation-state transition metal. A synthesized multiple-oxidation-state NiFe catalyst consisting of high-oxidation-state Fe3+ and low-oxidation-state Ni-0 exhibited excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 160 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), surpassing the performance of OER catalysts that consist only of high- or low-oxidation-state active metals. Through mechanistic studies, we confirmed that the introduction of Ni-0 accelerated the charge transfer kinetics and decreased the energy barrier for water oxidation. This study presents a new perspective on the modification of the oxidation state of the active metal for optimizing the OER process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000864809700001

Here, a heat-induced magnetic transition strategy is reported to speed up the oxidation kinetics of redox couples. The activation energy of Ni2+/Ni3+ redox couple oxidation is sharply decreased by heating the Ni0.67Fe0.33OxHy catalyst above a Curie temperature (T-c) of 70 degrees C. In such a strategy, heat instead of electricity drives the spin flipping of Ni2+/Ni3+ oxidation through heat-sensitive ferri-to-paramagnetic spin state changes. As a result of magnetic transition-assisted efficient heat-electricity coupling, Ni0.67Fe0.33OxHy exhibits the lowest OER overpotential of 221 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) at 90 degrees C in alkaline electrolytes, outperforming the benchmark IrO2 catalyst.

Interface engineering can represent a practical approach to enhance catalytic performance. In this work, a cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique as an intentional surface reconstruction strategy is utilized to promote FeCoNiCrVB as a highly active OER catalyst. The activated electrocatalyst manifests enhanced catalytic activity with a low overpotential of 237 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 24.2 mV dec(-1), compared with the pristine one (332 mV & 46.2 mV dec(-1)). The excellent activity and long-term stability make reconstructed FeCoNiCrVB a promising candidate to catalyze the OER process. The amorphous state, highly active sites and entropy engineering jointly contribute to its advanced OER performance. This work shows the great potential of multicomponent alloys as electrocatalysts, and provides new ideas for the enhancement of the OER activity by using an electrochemical surface reconstruction strategy.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000781862600001

The experimental study demonstrated the effects of cerium (Ce) on distribution of light energy and photochemical activities of spinach chloroplast grown in lead (Pb)-present media. It was observed that Pb2+ significantly inhibited photosynthesis in spinach, including light absorption, energy transfer from LHCII to photosystent II, excitation energy distribution from photosystem I to photosystem II, and transformation from light energy to electron energy and oxygen evolution of chloroplasts, and decreased spinach growth. However, Ce3+ treatment to Pb2+-present chloroplasts could obviously improve light absorption and excitation energy distribution in both photosystems and increase activity of photochemical reaction and oxygen evolution of chloroplasts. The results suggested that Ce3+ under Pb2+ stress could maintain the stability of chloroplast membrane, and improve photosynthesis of spinach chloroplast, thus promote spinach growth.									8	3	0	0	3	0	8			1002-0721			WOS:000271072200034

Herein, we demonstrated the construction of graphited carbon-coated FeTiO3 (FeTiO3@C) via in situ annealing Ti3C2Tx nanosheets in a rusted-reactor and its efficient bifunctional activity for rechargeable Zn-air batteries (RZABs). The electron-transport dynamics of FeTiO3@C can be improved by using highly conductive graphited carbon derived from Ti3C2Tx. The FeTiO3@C catalyst annealed at 500 degrees C exhibits excellent OER and ORR activities. Specifically, FeTiO3@C shows a low overpotential of 323 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 53 mV dec(-1) towards the alkaline OER. During the OER process, FeTiO3@C can be partially converted into highly active iron oxyhydroxide via in situ electrochemical reconstruction, which serves as the active species. After being assembled to RZABs, it shows an open-circuit potential of 1.33 V, a high trip efficiency of 63.4% and long-time cycling stability. This work can provide a new avenue for developing bifunctional electrocatalysts for RZABs used in portable devices.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000772569300001	35332347

Here, we grow two-dimensional cobalt-iron hydroxide (CoFe-OH) nanosheets on nickel foam substrates and deposit FeOOH nanoparticles in a rapid and scalable wet chemical approach. The CoFe-OH@FeOOH nanocomposite features abundant active sites and high surface area, allowing fast kinetics for electrochemical water splitting. The electrode has a low overpotential value of 200 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution. When used as both anode and cathode for overall water splitting, CoFeOH@FeOOH provides a low cell voltage of 1.56 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) current density. The synergistic activity is presumed to be from the seamless interface of CoFe-OH and FeOOH, improving conductivity and mass transfer.

The outstanding OER performance of the 3D-OMNiSA could be attributed to the large surface area, efficient mass and charge transport, and high structural stability arising from the unique 3D hierarchical porous structure of the 3D-OMNiSA consisting of ordered close-packed mesoporous spheres.									95	6	0	0	6	0	95			2155-5435			WOS:000371755500006

Here, we report the electrodeposition of Ni (OH)(2)/NiOOH in the presence of urea showing the improved electrocatalysis for the hydrogen production in KOH electrolyte. By potential scanning, the Ni(OH)(2) colloid in alkali solution was transformed into the deposited Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH. The presence of urea facilitates to deposit Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH with higher electron transfer than the absence of urea, leading to a higher electrocatalytic OER. As supporting electrolyte, KOH exhibits better performance on the electrodeposition of Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH and their OER electrocatalysis than NaOH. The work shows the potential application using cheap, non-precious metal-based electrocatalysts to overcome the well-known bottlenecks limiting power density of hydrogen fuel cell and energy efficiency of splitting water.

PMO containing acridone groups in the framework (Acd-PMO), a visible-light harvesting antenna, was supported with [Ru-II(bpy)(3)(2+)] complex (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridyl) coupled with iridium oxide (IrOx) particles in the mesochannels as photosensitizer and catalyst, respectively. Acd-PMO absorbed visible light and funneled the light energy into the Ru complex in the mesochannels through excitation energy transfer. The excited state of Ru complex is oxidatively quenched by a sacrificial oxidant (Na2S2O8) to form Ru3+ species. The Ru3+ species extracts an electron from IrOx to oxidize water for oxygen production. The reaction quantum yield was 0.34 %, which was improved to 0.68 or 1.2% by the modifications of PMO. A unique sequence of reactions mimicking natural photosystem II, 1) light-harvesting, 2) charge separation, and 3) oxygen generation, were realized for the first time by using the light-harvesting PMO.									22	1	0	0	1	0	22			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000339386700044	24890840

We purified the dimer of PSII complex from a thermophilic cyanobacterium, Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, which grows optimally at 57 degrees C. The thermally stable PSII dimeric complex has a diameter of 20 nm and a molecular mass of 756 kDa and binds more than 60 chlorophylls. The SBA particles, with average internal pore diameters of 15 nm (SBA(15)) and 23 nm (SBA(23)), adsorbed 4.7 and 15 mg of PSII/g SBA, respectively. Measurement with a confocal laser-scanning microscope indicated the adsorption of PSII to the surface and the inner space of the SBA(23) particles, indicating the adsorption of PSII into the 23 nm silica nanopores. PSII did not bind to the inner pores of SBA(15). PSII bound to SBA(23) showed the high and stable activity of a photosynthetic oxygen-evolving reaction, indicating the light-driven electron transport from water to the quinone molecules added in the outer medium. The PSII-SBA conjugate can be a new material for photosensors and artificial photosynthetic systems.									34	0	0	0	19	0	36			0743-7463			WOS:000285990500031	21171572

In this work, N and P co-doped carbon-coated cobalt-doped molybdenum phosphide (CoMoP@N,P-C) nanoparticles are explored as electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. The presence of a unique three-dimensional (3D) porous structure in CoMoP@N,P-C offers abundant catalytic active sites for the penetration of the electrolyte solution, thereby facilitating the transfer of ions. In addition, cobalt doped into MoP increases the catalytic activity, and N and P co-doped carbon improves the electrical conductivity of the carbon matrix. Subsequently, the synergy between CoMoP cores and N, P-C shells enhances the total hydrolysis performance of the electrocatalyst in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes. At a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) in 1 M KOH, HER and OER overpotential of the CoMoP@N, P-C are 152 mV and 296 mV, respectively. Moreover, the cell voltage of CoMoP@N, P-C as a bifunctional electrode for overall water splitting is 1.62 V (at 10 mA/cm(2)), which is close to that of the full noble-metal electrode (RuO2 parallel to Pt/C, 1.58 V). Overall, the CoMoP@N, P-C bifunctional catalyst shows great potential for replacing noble-metal electrodes in water splitting applications. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

However, the current catalytic activity and stability are unsatisfactory. Herein, we started from optimizing the geometric and electronic structure of the catalyst, choosing FeCo Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) with rich pores as precursors and epitaxially grown Ni(OH)(2) and then connecting them though graphene oxide (GO) by electrostatic interaction, and finally transformed them into ternary TMPs and graphene composites (Fe2P/CoP/Ni5P4/RGO). Due to the porous structure of phosphides and the large surface area and excellent conductivity of reduced graphene oxide (RGO), the Fe2P/CoP/Ni5P4/RGO exposed more active sites, promoted electrolyte diffusion and gas release, and accelerated the charge transport. The synergistic effect among ternary TMPs and between them and RGO made Fe2P/CoP/Ni5P4/RGO a highly efficient electrocatalyst for water splitting with only 57 mV, 232 mV overpotential, and 1.56 V cell voltage for obtaining 10 mA/cm(2) current density in HER, OER, and overall water splitting. Benefiting from the protection of RGO, the Fe2P/CoP/Ni5P4/RGO remained the original structure and showed good stability during long-term testing. This work proposed a design thought to improve the activity and stability of metal phosphides that may be extended to other metal organic framework-derived compounds and carbon-based materials composites.									29	2	0	0	0	0	29			2168-0485			WOS:000480370500096

This paper presents the intellectual and historical background of the idea of the correlation between stellar energy production and the synthesis of the chemical elements in stars on the example of this cycle. In particular, it addresses the contributions of Carl Friedrich von Weizsacker and Hans Bethe, who provided the first predictions of the carbon cycle. Further, the experimental verification of the predicted process as it developed over the following decades is discussed, as well as the extension of the initial carbon cycle to the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) multi-cycles and the hot CNO cycles. This development emerged from the detailed experimental studies of the associated nuclear reactions over more than seven decades. Finally, the impact of the experimental and theoretical results on our present understanding of hydrogen burning in different stellar environments is presented, as well as the impact on our understanding of the chemical evolution of our universe.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1422-6944	1422-6960		WOS:000427372200005

By varying the lithium content in LixNi1-xO (x = 0 to x = 0.42) and correspondingly the mean oxidation state of nickel (2 to 3) and the crystal structure type (from disordered to ordered rock salt type), it has been shown that nickel hydroxide thin films are formed electrochemically on the oxide surface. The structures of these nickel hydroxide films are determined not only by the chemical composition and crystal structure of LixNi1-xO substrates but also determined by the anodic polarization conditions and the electrolyte type. alpha-Type Ni.OH.H2O is deposited on NiO, and during anodic polarization it is partially transformed to beta-type Ni.OH, resulting in an enhanced electrocatalytic activity. On ordered LixNi1-xO (0.3 less than or equal to x < 0.5), oxyhydroxide films of Ni.O.OH are formed by ion exchange of Li+ with electrolyte protons. During anodic polarization of these samples, Ni4+ ions are stabilized, with a consequent significant decrease in their electrocatalytic activity. The highest activity towards O-2 evolution is displayed by LixNi1-xO (0.05 less than or equal to x less than or equal to 0.2) with a disordered rock salt structure, on which beta-type Ni.OH films, which are stable during anodic polarization, are formed. The possible insertion of electrolyte ions into the nickel hydroxide films is discussed on the basis of comparative measurements performed in KOH and LiOH electrolytes.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0022-0728			WOS:A1993MP83800012

Core/mantle grains, organic nano-globules, comets and surface chemistry								ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE				3	12					160224	10.1098/rsos.160224				DEC 2016	2016	Within the framework of The Heterogeneous dust Evolution Model for Interstellar Solids (THEMIS), this work explores the surface processes and chemistry relating to core/mantle interstellar and cometary grain structures and their influence on the nature of these fascinating particles. It appears that a realistic consideration of the nature and chemical reactivity of interstellar grain surfaces could self-consistently and within a coherent framework explain: the anomalous oxygen depletion, the nature of the CO dark gas, the formation of 'polar ice' mantles, the red wing on the 3 mu m water ice band, the basis for the O-rich chemistry observed in hot cores, the origin of organic nano-globules and the 3.2 mu m 'carbonyl' absorption band observed in comet reflectance spectra. It is proposed that the reaction of gas phase species with carbonaceous a-C(: H) grain surfaces in the interstellar medium, in particular the incorporation of atomic oxygen into grain surfaces in epoxide functional groups, is the key to explaining these observations. Thus, the chemistry of cosmic dust is much more intimately related with that of the interstellar gas than has previously been considered. The current models for interstellar gas and dust chemistry will therefore most likely need to be fundamentally modified to include these new grain surface processes.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			2054-5703			WOS:000391731800003	28083090

However, the drawbacks of Li2MnO3 such as its low conductivity and oxygen evolution during delithiation make cathode materials less attractive in terms of safety, rate and cycling performances than traditional cathode materials. This work aims to improve the properties of Li2MnO3-related cathode materials by doping molybdenum (Mo) into Li2MnO3 (C2/c). First-principles calculations within the PBE + U scheme show that Mo doping is beneficial for improving both the dynamic and thermodynamic properties of Li2MnO3 by reducing the band gap and increasing the number of electronic states near the Fermi level. This promotes Li-ion diffusion between the lithium layer and transition-metal layer and charge transference from Mo to O, lowering the delithiation potential, adding Mo as another charge compensation donator upon Li removal, and enhancing the stability of oxygen according to the reaction enthalpy. Therefore, Mo doping is expected to be an effective way to improve the structural stability and rate performance of Li2MnO3 and xLi(2)MnO(3)center dot(1 - x)LiMO2 cathode materials.									83	7	0	0	1	0	86			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000332460800043

Therefore, the synergistic regulation between the rGN covered hierarchical structure and nickel dopants by promoting the intrinsic ORR/OER properties, electrical conductivity, and mass transfer is responsible to the superior catalytic performance. Moreover, as a bi-functional catalyst for liquid and flexible Zn-air batteries, Ni-Co9S8/rGN based battery exhibits excellent battery performance, especially high power density, superior rate performance and long-term cycling stability, providing a new vision for the preparation of high-efficiency catalysts in energy conversion.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000702311200005

The structure of Sr2Mn2O6 is known to consist of dimeric units of face-sharing MnO6 octahedra. Whereas, CaSrMn2O6 contains individual octahedra, connected to each other through corner-sharing. Herein we show that the changes in the crystal structure result in significant improvement of the electrical conductivity, by five orders of magnitude, for CaSrMn2O6, compared to Sr2Mn2O6. Variable temperature conductivity studies from 25-800 degrees C indicate semiconducting properties for both compounds, where the enhanced conductivity of CaSrMn2O6 persists in the entire temperature range. The electrocatalytic activity of both compounds toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has also been investigated, indicating superior OER activity of CaSrMn2O6 compared to Sr2Mn2O6. A pronounced improvement in the onset potential and kinetics of OER is observed for CaSrMn2O6.

Ultrathin secondary nanosheets with different Co to Fe ratios that are subsequently grown on these primary nanoarrays are found to exhibit high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The optimal composition of CoyFe1-y(OH)(x) NSAs turns out to be Co0.7Fe0.3(OH) (x) NSAs, which allows for an OER onset overpotential as low as 220 mV and a small Tafel slope at 62.4 mV dec(-1), while also providing excellent long-term durability (> 100 h) and a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.172 s(-1) at an overpotential of 380 mV.

Due to its relatively low oxidation resistance, Ni3N is electrochemically self-oxidized into nickel oxides/oxyhydroxides (electroactive sites) during the OER. However, we lack a full understanding of the effects of Ni3N self-oxidation and Fe impurity incorporation into Ni3N from electrolyte towards OER activity. Here, we report on our examination of the compositional and structural transformation of Ni3N precatalyst layers on Ni foams (Ni3N/Ni foam) during extended periods of OER testing in Fe-purified and unpurified KOH media using both a standard three-electrode cell and a flow cell, and discuss their electrocatalytic properties. After the OER tests in both KOH media, the Ni3N surfaces were converted into amorphous, nano-porous nickel oxide/(oxy)hydroxide surfaces. In the Fe-purified electrolyte, a decrease in OER activity was confirmed after the OER test because of the formation of pure NiOOH with low OER activity and electrical conductivity. Conversely, in the unpurified electrolyte, a continuous increase in OER activity was observed over the OER testing, which may have resulted from the Fe incorporation into the self-oxidation-formed NiOOH. Our experimental findings revealed that Fe impurities play an essential role in obtaining notable OER activity using the Ni3N precatalyst. Additionally, our Ni3N/Ni foam electrode exhibited a low OER overpotential of 262 mV to reach a geometric current density of 10 mA cm(geo)(-2) in a flow cell with unpurified electrolyte.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8				2633-5409		WOS:000651337600008		
J	Xu, Shuai; Liu, Yuan; Tong, Jinlin; Hu, Wei; Xia, Qinghua								Iridium-Nickel Composite Oxide Catalysts for Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acidic Water Electrolysis								RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMISTRY				52	11			1021	1031		10.1134/S1023193516110124				NOV 2016	2016	A series of Ir1-xNixO2-y (0 <= x <= 0.5) composite oxides have been prepared by a simple pyrolysis method in ethanol system and used as the electrocatalysts for OER in acidic medium. The materials have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical performances of these Ir1-xNixO2-y composite catalysts are evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and steady-state measurements. The resulting oxides with the Ni content (x) less than 0.3 have a complex nature of metal Ir and rutile structure IrO2 which is similar to the Ir oxide prepared by the same approach and possess the contracted lattice resulted from the Ni-doping. Although the addition of Ni reduces the electroactive surface areas due to the coalescence of particles, the catalytic activity of the Ir1-xNixO2-y (0 < x <= 0.3) catalysts is slightly higher than that of the pyrolyzed Ir oxide. Regardless of the surface area difference, the intrinsic activity first increases and then decreases with the Ni content in Ir1-xNixO2-y catalysts, and the intrinsic activity of Ir0.7Ni0.3O2-y catalyst is about 1.4 times of the Ni-free Ir oxide mainly attributed to the enhancement of conductivity and a change of the binding energy as increasing amount of the incorporated Ni with respect to the pure IrO2. The Ir0.7Ni0.3O2-y catalyst shows a prospect of iridium-nickel oxide materials in reducing the demand of the expensive Ir oxide catalyst for OER in acidic water electrolysis.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1023-1935	1608-3342		WOS:000389836600003

The influence of HTMAB on the two processes in water electrolysis, i.e., hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was investigated. The results showed that an opposite effect of HTMAB on the HER and OER occurs with carbon-based electrodes, i.e., inhibiting the HER indicated as a small negative-potential shift, but enhancing OER as a large negative-potential shift. The improvement on the OER due to the introduction of HTMAB into H2SO4 is large enough to offset the declination of the HER in the water electrolysis. The enhancement of HTMAB on the OER is mainly due to accelerating H2O2 production from water oxidation at a relatively negative potential. The intermediate H2O2 in water electrolysis was detected and confirmed by an enzymatic method. The enhancement of HTMAB on the OER, however, was not observed on systems of Pt/H2SO4, CC/KOH and Ni/KOH. It shows that the mechanism of the water electrolysis on the different electrodes in the different electrolyte decides whether the HTMAB plays an enhanced role in the water electrolysis or not. All plausible reasons causing current increase in water electrolysis in H2SO4 apart from the catalytic effect of the HTMAB on enhancement of H2O2 production have been clearly eliminated. We conceive that there may be a possibility to obtain H2O2 rather than O-2 besides H-2 from the water electrolysis just using the carbon-based electrode with introduction of the cationic surfactant HTMAB as the electrolysis voltage is controlled within a certain range.

The structural properties of Bi2W1-xMoxO6 were studied by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique, which showed an orthorhombic Aurivillius layered crystal structure. The microstructural features were examined by FE-SEM and FE-TEM techniques which showed that the morphology of Bi2WO6 varies with substitution of Mo and each morphological structure grows via the assembly of tiny nanoparticles of size 50 nm. The effective substitution of Mo in Bi2WO6 extends the optical absorption towards the visible region. The substitution of Mo in place of W was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activities were evaluated by OER under solar light irradiation. The sample Bi2W0.6Mo0.4O6 (S3) shows enhanced photocatalytic activity for OER from aqueous AgNO3 solution (652 mol h(-1) g(-1)) which is higher than for pristine Bi2MoO6 or Bi2WO6 photocatalysts. Enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the extended absorption in the visible light region, which enhances the photocatalytic efficiency of the photocatalysts. More significantly, the 3D intrinsically layered nanosheet structure based morphology, and the unique band structure are beneficial for efficient charge transfer, which enhances the photocatalytic activity. This work demonstrates an effective strategy for developing an active photocatalyst with greater utilization of solar light.									5	1	0	0	1	0	6			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000448568100047

The material characteristics were associated with the electrocatalytic properties by evaluating the CoMoO4 crystal structures (XRD and Raman), morphologies (TEM), and electrochemical features (electrochemically active surface area, roughness factor, electrochemical impedance, Tafel analysis, and controlled -current electrolysis). These combined findings revealed that the electrocatalytic performance is greatly influenced by the crystalline structures of CoMoO4, following the order alpha-CoMoO4 > H-CoMoO4 > beta-CoMoO4. The H-CoMoO4 catalysts crystallized in the triclinic space group, P (1) over bar with Z = 4. On the other hand, the alpha- and beta-CoMoO, catalysts exhibited a monoclinic structure, C2/m (#12), with Z = 8. In the OER experiments, alpha-CoMoO4 showed an overpotential of 0.43 +/- 0.05 V compared to the 0.51 +/- 0.05 V and 0.56 +/- 0.04 V exhibited by the H-CoMoO4 and beta-CoMoO4 catalysts, respectively, to achieve 10 mA cm(-2). All CoMoO4 structures displayed stability for at least 6 h at a controlled current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Finally, computational simulations indicate that the coexistence of Co and Mo ions in edge-shared octahedral sites of alpha-CoMoO4 may favor the interaction between the 0 atom of the water molecule and the metal adsorption sites due to its surface being electronically less dense than beta- and H-CoMoO4 surfaces, thus resulting in its higher performance for OER.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			1466-8033			WOS:000451163700014

The characteristics of the as-fabricated Co@CoTe(2)electrode in terms of the crystal structure, surface morphology and chemical components were analyzed. Moreover, the electrochemical properties of the Co@CoTe(2)electrocatalyst used for water electrolysis were comprehensively investigated. When used to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 M KOH, Co@CoTe(2)electrodes exhibit outstanding catalytic activity and long-term durability, thus outperforming many well-studied cobalt based dichalcogenides (including tellurides, selenides and sulfides) that have been recently reported in the literature. Particularly, Co@CoTe(2)prepared at 240 degrees C (Co@CoTe2-240) requires a low overpotential of only 286 mV to attain an anodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2)and shows fast kinetics for the OER with a small Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1). Moreover, the overpotential needed to maintain 10 mA cm(-2)is merely increased by 20 mV after continuous OER electrolysis for 16 hours, exhibiting excellent long-term stability. Given the commercial availability of porous Co foam, the convenient and scalable approach of hydrothermal synthesis and the outstanding catalytic performance, the self-supported Co@CoTe(2)electrode reported here holds great promise as an important OER electrocatalyst in water splitting devices and metal-air batteries.									21	1	0	0	1	0	21			2052-1553			WOS:000544485000009

Among the transition metals, copper is one of the cheapest earth-abundant nonprecious element which can enhance electrocatalytic activity due to heavily occupied d-orbitals. In this article we have shown electrocatalytic activity of copper selenide for the first time for water oxidation reaction. The copper selenide phases were synthesized by direct electrodeposition on electrodes, as well as by hydrothermal and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques. Structure and morphology characterization through powder X-ray diffraction, Raman, X-photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron microscopy revealed that all the synthesized phases were pure crystalline copper selenide of composition Cu2Se and comprising nanostructured granular morphology. Electrocatalytic performance for water oxidation was investigated in alkaline solution (1 M KOH) and it was observed that Cu2Se showed a low overpotential of only 270 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2). This catalyst also displayed a low Tafel slope of 48.1 mV dec(-1). Interestingly Cu2Se showed comparable electrocatalytic activity irrespective of the method of synthesis indicating that it is indeed an intrinsic property of the material. Chronoamperometric studies revealed that the catalyst retained its activity for prolonged periods of continuous oxygen evolution exceeded 6 h, while postactivity characterization revealed that crystallinity and surface composition was preserved after catalytic activity. Because copper selenides can be found in nature as stable minerals, this article can initiate a new concept for efficient catalyst design.									64	1	0	0	2	0	64			2574-0962			WOS:000458706400065

The presence and role of oxidative species, such as singlet oxygen (O-1(2)), superoxide (O-2(-.)) and hydroperoxy (HO2.) radicals was examined with the use of appropriate quenchers of these species. The reaction pathway of dye degradation was also investigated by monitoring the temporal evolution of intermediates and final products on both the photocatalyst surface and in solution, with the use of a variety of techniques, including GC-MS, FTIR and UV-Vis spectroscopies. It has been found that complete decolorization of the solution may be achieved, accompanied by a substantial decrease of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the solution. Evidence is presented that the main oxidative species is O-2(-.) (or HO2.), while singlet oxygen, when formed, is also active. The adsorbed dye molecule is initially cleaved in the vicinity of the azo-bond and the resulting fragments are oxidized toward compounds of progressively lower molecular weight and, eventually, to CO2 and inorganic ions. However, when the solution is bleached, formation of active oxidative species does not take place, oxidation reactions cease and the concentrations of the dye intermediates remain practically stable upon further exposure to visible light irradiation. Formation of photoinduced hydrogen peroxide, which is also generated under the present conditions, also stops when the dye concentration in solution drops to very low levels. This behavior has been explained evoking the photosensitization mechanism of wide band-gap semiconductors, according to which the reaction is triggered by excitation of the dye molecule by visible light photons, followed by charge injection to the conduction band of the semiconductor and subsequent production of active oxygen radicals. Formation of the latter oxidizing species is possible only in the presence of visible light-absorbing compounds and cannot take place after fragmentation of the parent AO7 molecule in the vicinity of the azo-bond and decolorization.

ATR-IR, AFM and nano-IR reveal the radial distribution of specific functional groups. It was found that under oxygen-sufficient conditions, many ladder aromatic rings are formed in the skin. Intermolecular crosslinking presumably occurs through oxygen-induced dehydrogenation reactions. Under oxygen-deprived conditions, large numbers of isolated aromatic rings are generated in the core. Intermolecular crosslinking is dependent on comonomer concentration. In addition, different fractured and polished morphologies of skin and core may be identified using SEM and OM, providing evidence for radial transformations of crystal structure. Moreover, the modulus distribution in the fiber as reflected by nano-LCR further supports the proposed intermolecular crosslinking and crystal rearrangement processes.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			0032-3861	1873-2291		WOS:000533634800019

Silicate dusts instantaneously heated above liquidus temperature are assumed to cool in gas and experience partial evaporation and subsequent recondensation. The results show that isotopic exchange effectively suppresses mass-dependent O-isotope fractionation even if the degree of evaporation is large, which is the fundamental difference from the case without isotopic exchange. The final composition of silicate melt strongly depends on the initial abundance of oxygen in the ambient gas relative to that in silicate dust, but not on the cooling rate of the system. The model was applied to O-isotope evolution of silicate melts in isotopically distinct gas of the protoplanetary disk. It was found that deviation from a straight mixing line toward the d18O-rich side on the three-oxygen isotope diagram is inevitable when mass-dependent fractionation and isotopic exchange take place simultaneously; the degree of deviation depends on the abundance of oxygen in an ambient gas and isotopic exchange efficiency. The model is applied to explain O-isotopic compositions of igneous CAIs and chondrules.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1086-9379	1945-5100		WOS:000306898000008

In the present work, La2NiO4 (LNO) synthesized by a hydrothermal process and modified Pechini method were studied as catalysts for rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries. The catalyst prepared by the hydrothermal method shows a smaller particle size and a macroporous structure with 10 x higher surface area than that synthesized by the Pechini counterpart, leading to a better electrocatalytic activity. The improved OER catalytic activity of the hydrothermal-LNO nanoparticles was confirmed by a 150 mV lower recharge potential than the Pechini-LNO particles and catalyst-free pure Super P (SP) electrode. In addition, the hydrothermal-LNO catalyzed battery cell delivered a first discharge capacity of 14 310.9 mA h g(-1) at 0.16 mA cm(-2), compared to 8132.4 mA h g(-1) of the Pechini-LNO and 7478.8 mA h g(-1) of the pure SP electrode, demonstrating higher catalytic ORR activity of the hydrothermal-LNO particles. Overall, the LNO nanoparticles are a promising cathode catalyst for non-aqueous electrolyte based Li-O-2 batteries.									16	2	0	0	0	0	18				2046-2069		WOS:000371163900066

In the current work, natural phyto-stabilizing agents have been employed to synthesize nano-structured particles of NiO:ZnO/PdO having higher surface area and superior electrocatalytic properties. Prior to thermal treatment the precipitates of respective metal salts have been appeared because of formation of a complex between metal oxide and extract of phyto-organic material. After calcinations, obtained black colored product of NiO:ZnO/PdO was characterized by spectroscopic techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Based on XRD results, Scherer formula was used to calculate crystallite size which was in well agreement with SEM results taken at different magnification confirming synthesis of NiO:ZnO/PdO nanocomposite. The phyto synthesized powder's slurry was casted over Ni and was verified for purpose of electro-catalysis for renewable energy. The fabricated electrode revealed a good deal of improved performance with over-potential value of 0.41V and the Tafel slope of 76 mV/dec. when tested for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The catalyst has also been tested for Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) studies and the findings were quite satisfactory. Thus current work provides a way leading to fabrication of low cost metal oxide based electrode material using facile greener synthesis approach.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1369-8001	1873-4081		WOS:000827581400002

Chemical conditions								MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY				488	1			525	535		10.1093/mnras/stz1638				SEP 2019	2019	It is still not known whether or not bimodal dust species (namely the silicate and amorphous carbon dust grains that are observed in a nova eruption) are formed in nova ejecta. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics code and considering the effects of the white dwarf mass, the mass-accretion rate and the chemical profile, which are described by a new parameter (the mixing depth), on the chemical abundances of nova ejecta, we investigate the possibility that bimodal dust species are produced in a nova eruption. We find that the C/O (the ratio of the carbon number density to the oxygen number density) of nova ejecta is affected by the mixing depth. For a model with a small mixing depth, the C/O of nova ejecta can evolve from greater than 1.0 to less than 1.0 over the course of an eruption, thereby providing the chemical conditions for the formation of bimodal dust species.									6	2	0	0	0	0	7			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000482319700042

In this work, Cu was introduced into the 2D Co-MOF structure, and a 2D book-like CuCo-MOF structure was fixed on carbon fiber paper (CFP) for direct electrochemical glucose detection and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The materials showed good electrocatalytic glucose detection performance with a sensitivity as high as 6.861 mA mM(-1) cm(-2) and a detection limit as low as 0.12 mu M. For the OER, when the current density is 10 mA cm(-2), the overpotential (eta) is 340 mV, and good stability is maintained for about 10 h without current attenuation. This work not only exploits a new 2D MOF structure containing Cu, but also expands the potential of Cu-containing MOF materials in the electrocatalytic OER, making a contribution to the field of energy conversion and biomolecular sensing.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000687272900001

Recently, mossbauerite, obtained by chemical oxidation of an all-iron, mixed-valence green rust (GR) LDH, was introduced as an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst. An accurate characterization of the structure of mossbauerite is necessary for a knowledge-based future optimization of OER performance. However, as is typical for layered materials, massive defects hamper the understanding of its true structure. In this work, we elucidate the structure of mossbauerite and gain insight into the structure-property relationships relevant to its potential as an OER catalyst. Density functional theory calculations show that upon oxidation of a GR precursor to mossbauerite, the direct grafting of interlayer anions to octahedral iron becomes energetically feasible. This indicates that the grafted and interlayer carbonate anions may coexist in a random interstratification. This prediction is supported by analysis of infrared spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction data, which show that an interstratified model with turbostratic planar disorder provides a good fit with the experiment.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000492118400017		
J	Choi, Dongchul; Kim, Young Sung; Son, Yongkeun								Recovery of indium tin oxide (ITO) and glass plate from discarded TFT-LCD panels using an electrochemical method and acid treatment								RSC ADVANCES				4	92			50975	50980		10.1039/c4ra11085d				2014	2014	The recovery of ITO and the glass substrate from discarded TFT-LCDs, without crushing the glass substrate, was done by using an electrochemical method and acid treatments. Anodic conditions did not show any redox reaction of the ITO except oxygen evolution. The oxygen evolution lifted the ITO layer off the glass substrate with the remaining colour filer and black matrix. Recovery of the ITO was 75%, but it showed an In-Sn ratio of 15.9 : 1. The recovered ITO was not suitable for reuse directly. It may be that it needed the addition of extra Sn. However, this work presented a new process for the resource circulation of the indium from discarded LCD panels. The free glass substrate was then recovered after removing the colour filter and black matrix by using an acid solution. The optical transmittance of the recovered glass substrate was about 90% in the visible region, and the average roughness was 0.96 nm.									16	0	0	0	4	0	16				2046-2069		WOS:000344325400086

Control over TMD electronic and optical properties, which depend on dimensionality and are modified by nanostructuring and adsorbates, is important for the development and deployment of reliable nanoscale devices for such applications. Density functional theory calculation results for the atomic structure, energetics, and electronic structure of the metal edges of 2D MX2 (M = Mo, W and X = S, Se) with several coverages of adsorbed hydrogen, oxygen, hydroxyl radicals, and water are presented. Using zigzag nanoribbon models, it is found that compared with the basal planes of MX2, edges are more active and exhibit a rich adsorbent behavior. In general, the thermodynamically stable M-edges, with two X adatoms, weakly bind hydrogen, oxygen, and water and strongly bind hydroxyl. However, adsorption energies depend on the adsorbate type and coverage and may be tuned for the catalysis of important chemical reactions such as water splitting and hydrogen evolution. The electronic band structure calculations show that, besides bandgap energy modifications and gap states, the well-established robust metallic character of the edge states is preserved, albeit Fermi-level shifts that depend both on adsorbates and adsorbents.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1862-6254	1862-6270		WOS:000744631200001

Experimental results reveal that the CoOx/Bi2WO6 demonstrate the enhanced OER activity with overpotential of 490 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2). The improved OER activity and good stability of CoOx/Bi2WO6 was attributed to the synergistic effects of abundant W-O-Co and Bi-O-Co species and oxygen vacancies presence in CoOx NPs, which can significantly increase the ECSA and active sites, enhance the electron transfer capacity, decrease charge-transfer resistance and improve conductivity in the process of electrochemistry. As a result, the synergistic effect of oxygen vacancies and strong-coupled endowed impressive performance of CoOx/Bi2WO6 for OER.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			0025-5408	1873-4227		WOS:000461403000022

Multi-metal-based electrocatalysts have attracted widespread attention because of their prominent electrical conductivity and synergistic catalysis effects between metal atoms. Herein, we design novel electrocatalysts consisting of Co3Mo3C/Co nanoparticles anchored in N-doped carbon (Co3Mo3C/Co@NC) via pyrolysis of cobalt molybdenum alkoxide and dicyandiamide. On account of the synergistic effect between Co3Mo3C and metallic Co, the composite enriches high activity and fast kinetics. Furthermore, nitrogen-doped carbon skeleton facilitates better corrosion resistance, high conductivity as well as fast electron transfer. The resulting Co3Mo3C/Co@NC composite electrode shows outstanding performance with a lower overpotential of 68 mV and 340 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively. The influence of Co on the activity of electrode materials and related mechanisms investigate systematically, which will open new perspectives to further design low cost functional materials for efficient water splitting.

Taking advantage of the physicochemical properties of precatalysts by manipulating their structural self-reconstruction levels provide a promising methodology for achieving suitable catalysts. In this review, we focus on recent advances in research related to the rational control of the process and level of surface transformation ultimately to design advanced oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. We start by discussing the original contributions to surface changes during electrochemical reactions and related factors that can influence the electrocatalytic properties of materials. We then present an overview of current developments and a summary of recently proposed strategies to boost electrochemical performance outcomes by the controlling structural self-reconstruction process. By conveying these insights, processes, general trends, and challenges, this review will further our understanding of surface reconstruction processes and facilitate the development of high-performance electrocatalysts beyond water oxidation.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				1420-3049		WOS:000701805800001	34576947

In 1.0 M KOH, it needs overpotentials as low as 298 and 357 mV to afford 20 and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively, comparing favourably to pure Cu2S counterpart (Cu2S/CF) and most Cu based catalysts in alkaline media.

Heteroatom incorporation is an effective strategy of defect engineering for optimizing the intrinsic electrocatalytic activities. In this research, zinc-doped ruthenium oxide (Zn-doped RuO2) nanorods were prepared by using the facile two-step method. It is found that the OER activity of Zn-doped RuO2 catalysts can be readily controlled by varying the amount of Zn dopants. The Zn-doped RuO2 catalyst with 6.4 at.% displays the best electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 206 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1) and a long-term chronopotentiometry test at 10 mA cm(-2) for 30 h towards OER in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The enhanced OER performance may be attributed to the defective structures caused by Zn doping and the ultrasmall size of the RuO2 nanocrystals.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2199-692X			WOS:000606517500001

Hence, measurements of solar neutrino fluxes provide a precise determination of the local temperature. The accumulation of non-annihilating light dark matter particles (with masses between 5 GeV and 16 GeV) in the Sun produces a change in the local solar structure, namely, a decrease in the central temperature of a few percent. This variation depends on the properties of the dark matter particles, such as the mass of the particle and its spin-independent scattering cross-section on baryon-nuclei, specifically, the scattering with helium, oxygen, and nitrogen among other heavy elements. This temperature effect can be measured in almost all solar neutrino fluxes. In particular, by comparing the neutrino fluxes generated by stellar models with current observations, namely B-8 neutrino fluxes, we find that non-annihilating dark matter particles with a mass smaller than 10 GeV and a spin-independent scattering cross-section with heavy baryon-nuclei larger than 3 x 10(-37) cm(-2) produce a variation in the B-8 neutrino fluxes that would be in conflict with current measurements.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000305738000052

Although the Zn1-xCdxS catalysts show comparatively higher activity for photocatalytic hydrogen generation under visible-light irradiation, they suffer from serious photocorrosion during the photocatalytic reaction. The deposition of a protective layer over the Zn1-xCdxS catalysts is believed to be an effective way to inhibit photocorrosion. However, only a few materials exhibit satisfactory catalytic properties for hydrogen evolution as well as a good protection ability. In this work, a new Zn1-xCdxS photocatalyst was developed for water splitting under visible-light illumination by assembling an ultrathin NiO layer over Zn0.8Cd0.2S through an insitu photodeposition method. The as-prepared NiO/Zn0.8Cd0.2S showed significantly higher activity for overall water splitting compared with Pt/Zn0.8Cd0.2S under the same conditions without photocorrosion. An apparent quantum efficiency of 0.66% was achieved for hydrogen evolution at 430nm with an accomplished multicycle stability for up to 12h without any significant decay. The strong electronic coupling between the NiO layer and Zn1-xCdxS also promoted efficient charge separation and migration.									37	4	0	0	2	0	37			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000467235500015	30694607

Herein, we report the successful incorporation of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) onto the hydrothermally grown nanoforest-like nickel selenide (Ni3Se2) grafted on the nickel foam (NF) via a facile dip-coating route. The fabricated Ni3Se2 shows excellent catalytic activity owing to the strong affinity of Ni3Se2 towards the NF substrate. Furthermore, the incorporation of rGO onto the Ni3Se2/NF can significantly enhance the conductivity and electrocatalytic performance of the rGO/Ni3Se2/NF electrocatalyst. The as-synthesized rGO/Ni3Se2/NF electrocatalyst exhibit a low overpotential of 292.61 mV and 251.01 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (OER) and - 10 mA cm(-2) (HER), respectively. The proposed rGO/Ni3Se2/NF electrocatalyst exhibit enormous active sites which in turn offers the low Tafel slope value (143.00 mV dec(-1) and 134.22 mV dec(-1)) and enhanced electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) towards the OER and HER electrocatalytic activity in 1 M KOH solution. Furthermore, the rGO/Ni3Se2/NF electrocatalyst shows superior stability for 12 hrs with the retention rate of 99.9% and 99.8%, when operated at 10 mA cm(-2) (OER) and - 10 mA cm(-2) (HER), respectively. Benefitting from the synergistic action of rGO and Ni3Se2, the proposed rGO/Ni3Se2/NF electrocatalyst leads to an excellent OER and HER activity. This work offers a promising strategy for the construction of highly efficient non-precious bifunctional electrocatalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000859021000006

Herein, a 3D self-supporting porous NiFe2O4-Ni3P-Fe2P film with sea urchin-like structure was fabricated by one-step electrodeposition, phase separation during the annealing, and selective oxidation thermal treatment. The multi-phase NiFe2O4-Ni3P-Fe2P film exhibited superior OER elerocatalytic activity and the long-term stability in alkaline solution. The overpotentials were 102 and 641 mV at current densities of 10 and 200 mA cm-2, respectively. The Tafel slope was 42 mV dec-1. The excellent performance could be attributed to the plentiful active sites provided porous sea urchin-like structure, the good conductivity of NiFe2O4, the synergetic effect of multiphase structure and the superior wettability. The features of NiFe2O4Ni3P-Fe2P film display promising application potential in the field of electrochemistry.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000737218800005

Herein, we demonstrated a facile strategy to modulate the electrons of doubly degenerated (e(g)) orbital for Co ions in Co4Nx (0 < x < 1) nanosheets via simply altering the N content for the enhanced OER catalytic activity. The decrease of N content in Co4Nx nanosheets accompanied with the increased number of e(g) electrons of Co ions. When the x value was 0.82, the e(g) electrons was successfully tuned to 1.18, which was close to the optimal configuration of 1.2. Accordingly, the Co4N0.82 nanosheets exhibited a remarkable activity toward OER, with an extremely low overpotential of 190 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) . A mechanistic study demonstrates that the decrease of N content gave rise to the decreased energy barrier of *OH oxidation in OER process, which was responsible to the boosted OER performance.									32	0	0	0	9	0	32			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000621629000004

The photothermal catalysis in the full solar spectrum has great development potential. In this paper, by thoroughly discussing the mechanism of light and heat respectively, the photothermal synergy in photothermal catalysis can be explained, the difficulty in exploring the photothermal synergy are solved. This review not only comprehensively and deeply explores the action mechanism of light and heat, but also focuses on the reaction mechanism of photothermal catalytic reduction of CO2, the yield and selectivity of photothermal catalysts. Increasing the surface temperature of the catalyst by photothermal effect, exciting carriers, and high-energy hot electrons, realizing photoactivation, changing the adsorption site and adsorption energy, and reducing the activation energy barrier and reaction temperature are manifested as the action mechanism of light. Increasing the rate of diffusion, adsorption, charge transfer and reaction, providing the energy required to cross the activation energy barrier, and activating thermal active sites are manifested as the action mechanism of heat. Oxygen vacancies are conducive to adsorption, thermal activation and cracking of reactive molecules.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000724609600003

Hence, uncovering the relationship between surface structure and catalytic performance at atomic scale is imperative for the rational design of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) electrocatalysts. In this work, firstly, we present a general method for the preparation of surface clean and structurally ordered PdFe intermetallics (o-PdFe). Subsequently, to further improve their performance towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acid medium, a mild yet effective surface treatment process is conducted to fabricate ultra-low content of Pt decorated porous PdFe intermetallics (p-o-PdFe@Pt). The p-o-PdFe@Pt are witnessed 28 fold improvement in ORR activity than that on Pt/C and only 15% attenuation after 10,000 cycles. Finally, the promotion mechanism of p-o-PdFe@Pt for ORR is investigated via chemically sensitive 3D tomography technique to visualize their structure and composition evolution. It reveals that the gradual Pt rearrangement on the surface plays a pivotal role in enhancing the ORR performance. This work not only demonstrates a strategy for the fabrication of Pt decorated porous PdFe intermetallics, but also provides a new insight for the promotion mechanism of elctrocatalysts.									10	1	0	0	0	0	11			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000613353000001

Catalysts were prepared from polyaniline, cobalt acetate and dicyandiamide as precursors for active site formation and as structure forming agents. The sulphur to cobalt ratio was investigated in a range of S/Co = 10 to 32. On the basis of a comprehensive structural characterisation by XRD, Raman, XPS, TEM and N-2 sorption measurements it was possible to show that the S/Co ratio has a significant impact on the carbon morphology. In fact, with increasing S/Co ratio the carbon morphology continuously changes from highly amorphous carbon to carbon-nanotubes, with increasing diameter. Besides the anticipated CoN4 sites and cobalt sulphite species, the catalysts also contained cobalt nanoparticles as well as cobalt hydroxide species. The most active catalyst required 0.37 +/- 0.01 V overpotential to reach 10 mA cm(-2) and even increased in activity during galvanostatic treatment and cycling-illustrating its very good performance. A faradaic efficiency of > 35% was determined. A detailed analysis of the activity and stability in combination with Raman and XPS provides two explanations for observed Tafel slope changes, that might also be coupled to each other, namely a change in the carbon oxidation rate depending on preparation and potential or a variation in the coverage by hydroxide and oxidic species of the metal, whereas hydroxide species seem to enable a higher OER activity.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000456724800063

Yet, it is still a huge challenge to develop an efficient IrO2 catalyst. Here, we demonstrate a microwave-assisted mechano-thermal method that achieves a new 3R phase IrO2. This 3R-IrO2 achieves an ultralow overpotential of 188 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(geo)(-2) and a notably high turnover frequency of 5.7 s(UPD)(-1) at 1.50 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. It also endures limited decay under the current density of 10mA cm(geo)(-2) for 511 h prolong test in acidic electrolyte. The new active sites of the edge-sharing structure in 3R-IrO2 and the fast proton transportation along interlayers and intralayers through iridium vacancies contribute to the extraordinary acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and stability. This work highlights the great potential of new metastable materials toward advanced electrocatalysis.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2542-4351			WOS:000732713600014

Efficient application of fire-fighting strategies and prevention of mining hazards require that the temporal evolution of fire propagation can be sufficiently precise predicted. A promising approach for the investigation of the temporal evolution is the numerical simulation of involved physical and chemical processes.In the context of the Sino-German Research Initiative 'Innovative Technologies for Detection, Extinction and Prevention of Coal Fires in North China,' a numerical model has been developed for simulating underground coal fires at large scales. The objective of such modelling is to investigate observables, like the fire propagation rate, with respect to the thermal and hydraulic parameters of adjacent rock. In the model, hydraulic, thermal and chemical processes are accounted for, with the last process complemented by laboratory experiments.Numerically, one key challenge in modelling coal fires is to circumvent the small time steps resulting from the resolution of fast reaction kinetics at high temperatures. In our model, this problem is solved by means of an 'operator-splitting' approach, in which transport and reactive processes of oxygen are independently calculated. At high temperatures, operator-splitting has the decisive advantage of allowing the global time step to be chosen according to oxygen transport, so that time-consuming simulation through the calculation of fast reaction kinetics is avoided. Also in this model, because oxygen distribution within a coal fire has been shown to remain constant over long periods, an additional extrapolation algorithm for the coal concentration has been applied.In this paper, we demonstrate that the operator-splitting approach is particularly suitable for investigating the influence of hydraulic parameters of adjacent rocks on coal fire propagation. A study shows that dynamic propagation strongly depends on permeability variations. For the assumed model, no fire exists for permeabilities k < 10(-10) m(2), whereas the fire propagation velocity ranges between 340 m a(-1) for k = 10(-8) m(2), and drops to lower than 3 m a(-1) for k = 5 x 10(-10) m(2). Additionally, strong temperature variations are observed for the permeability range 5 x 10(-10) m(2) < k < 10(-8) m(2).									56	6	0	0	3	0	59			0956-540X	1365-246X		WOS:000251669800032

This was followed by low-temperature phosphorization in the presence of NaH2PO2, whereby Co9S8@N, P-doped porous carbon (Co9S8@NPC) was finally obtained using the Co9S8@NC as a precursor. The results demonstrated that the molten-salt calcination approach can effectively create a pyrolytic product with a porous structure and improve the material's surface area, which is favourable for electrocatalysis-related mass transport and the exposure of catalytic active sites during electrocatalysis. As an electrocatalyst, Co9S8@NPC exhibits higher catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) than Co9S8@NC in an alkaline medium. Among all the investigated Co9S8@NPC catalysts, Co9S8@NPC-10 (mass ratio of NaH2PO2 to Co9S8@NC = 10 : 1) displays the best HER activity with an overpotential of 261 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in the alkaline medium. Interestingly, Co9S8@NPC-10 also displays good catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in this study. Owing to its bifunctional catalytic activity towards the HER and OER, the fabricated Co9S8@NPC-10 was simultaneously used as an anode and cathode material to generate O-2 and H-2 from overall water splitting in the alkaline medium, exhibiting a nearly 100% faradaic yield. This study would be helpful to the design and development of high performance non-precious metal electrocatalysts to be applied in overall water splitting to produce H-2 and O-2.									62	5	0	0	1	0	63				2046-2069		WOS:000399240400045

Here we demonstrate oxygen evolution catalysts that are based on non-noble metals, are formed in situ during electrooxidation of acidic water and exhibit a high stability in operation due to a self-healing mechanism. The highly disordered mixed metal oxides generated from dissolved cobalt, lead and iron precursors sustain high water oxidation rates at reasonable overpotentials. Moreover, utilizing a sufficiently robust electrode substrate allows for a continuous water oxidation at temperatures up to 80 degrees C and rates up to 500 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials below 0.7 V with an essentially flat support and with no loss in activity. This robust operation of the catalysts is provided by the thermodynamically stable lead oxide matrix that accommodates homogeneously distributed catalytic dopants.									60	0	0	0	5	0	61			2520-1158			WOS:000467975700013

However, the production of H2 fuel is restricted by the sluggish kinetics and high overpotentials of the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions. It is crucial to seek for high-efficiency electrocatalysts to boost the performance of water splitting. Among a great class of nanomaterials, MXenes-based nanomaterials can be utilized as excellent substrates to design novel materials due to their large specific surface area (SSA), fast electronic transmission, and excellent mechanical stability. However, the breakthroughs are at the experimental synthesis stage and lack all understanding of basic principles on catalytic mechanism, and then severely impede the development of high-efficiency electrocatalyst. Hence, some challenges still need to be clarified and resolved for fur-ther applications in electrocatalytic water splitting. In this review, the recent process on the synthesis routes, physical properties and performance improvement strategies for electrocatalytic water splitting of MXenes are summarized. We comprehensively summarize the electrocatalytic water splitting mech-anism of MXenes both experimentally and theoretically. The in-depth discussion on structure-activity relationships and the basic understanding on electrocatalytic mechanisms of MXenes are also reviewed. At last, an insight into the future challenges, opportunities and further research directions of MXenes and related materials in the water-splitting application is prospected. This review offers a significant under-standing for the design and optimization of high-efficiency MXenes-based electrocatalysts in water-splitting applications. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, it can operate stably for 500 cycles with a voltage gap increase of only 0.03 V at 10 mA·cm~(-2).

Oxygen reduction electrocatalysts with high efficiency, low cost and large-scale production are the key to promote the commercialization of new energy technology, such as, metal-air battery.

Herein, we introduce external N, including pyrrolic-N (PN) and graphitic-N (GN), as an electron acceptor near FeN4 to regulate its charge distribution and improve its ORR activity. Theoretical calculations reveal that introduction of PN evokes much enhanced electron redistribution and local electrical field on the Fe site compared with those observed with GN introduction and the pristine one. Synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy validate the positive charge accumulation of Fe in the FeN4 site induced by introducing PN. Thus, the obtained FeN4-PN exhibits a great performance for ORR in 0.1 M KOH with a remarkable half-wave potential of 0.91 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, as well as a Tafel slope of 58 mV decade(-1).

Among the many other catalyst supports tested, cerium oxide contributed significantly to the catalytic activity and stability of the Co/CeO2 catalyst as a result of its high oxygen mobility and storage capacity. In this paper, an overview of the research conducted in our laboratory during the past decade on ethanol steam reforming using the Co/CeO2 catalyst is presented. The role of the support oxygen mobility and storage capacity of the Co/CeO2 catalyst and how the addition of calcium to the ceria support changes the oxygen vacancies in the catalyst structure are discussed. Results from in situ characterization techniques, such as X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near edge structure, and extended X-ray absorption fine structure, are summarized, showing the evolution of the cobalt phases during synthesis, pretreatment, and ethanol steam reforming reaction. Also, how the synthesis parameters, such as synthesis method, impregnation medium, choice of cobalt precursor, support morphology, and particle size, could alter the catalytic activity and selectivity have been outlined.									54	2	0	0	0	0	56			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000380523200013

However, designing stable Cl- oxidation reaction (COR) electrocatalyst is the key to realize this route. Herein, a type of oxygen-modified Co nanoparticles anchored graphitic carbon nanofibers catalyst (Co/GCFs) was synthesized through a two-step strategy of adsorption and pyrolysis. The Co/GCFs-2.4 exhibits high selectivity and stability for COR at neutral electrolyte. It is worth noting that unlike the water oxidation, the chemical valence of cobalt has not changed during the COR. Further results demonstrated that the oxygen-modified Co nanoparticles provide active sites for selective COR, meanwhile, the graphitic carbon gives rise to strong catalytic stability. Thanks to the superior COR and H-2 production activity of Co/GCFs-2.4, a two-electrode brine electrocatalysis system employing Co/GCFs-2.4 as both cathode and anode for H-2 production exhibited robust stability, efficient and high Faraday efficiency (98%-100%). We propose that this work provides a novel strategy for designing efficient and stable catalysts with electrocatalytic COR and HER activities at neutral brine water for practically coupling with H-2 production by water electrolysis and brine water remediation.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000590923600004

BSCF-0.95 exhibits the best OER catalytic activity in the series perovskite. The current density of BSCF-0.95 is about 56% higher than that of BSCF oxide at a potential of 1.7 V. The experimental studies have shown that compared with BSCF, BSCF-0.95 oxide has a larger electrochemical surface area (ECSA), a higher content of O-2(2-) species related to surface oxygen vacancies, and faster charge transfer rate, which may be the factors for the enhancement of OER activity. The theoretical calculation results prove that the center positions of the O 2p-band of perovskite with A-site cation defects are closer to the Fermi level than BSCF oxide, which agrees with the OER performance trend of the material.									6	0	0	0	0	0	5			1001-604X	1614-7065		WOS:000676119600001

The development of new catalysts critically depends on synthetic methods that enable the preparation of tailored nanomaterials. Pulsed laser in liquids synthesis can produce uniform, multicomponent, nonequilibrium nanomaterials with independently and precisely controlled properties, such as size, composition, morphology, defect density, and atomistic structure within the nanoparticle and at its surface. We cover the fundamentals, unique advantages, challenges, and experimental solutions of this powerful technique and review the state-of-the-art of laser-made electrocatalysts for water oxidation, oxygen reduction, hydrogen evolution, nitrogen reduction, carbon dioxide reduction, and organic oxidations, followed by laser-made nanomaterials for light-driven catalytic processes and heterogeneous catalysis of thermochemical processes. We also highlight laser-synthesized nanomaterials for which proposed catalytic applications exist. This review provides a practical guide to how the catalysis community can capitalize on pulsed laser in liquids synthesis to advance catalyst development, by leveraging the synergies of two fields of intensive research.									30	1	0	0	0	0	30			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000674316500007	34077177

An unprecedented strategy based on the "bulk" deposition of the POM salt nanocrystals has been persecuted on purpose, avoiding the homogeneous dispersion of POM clusters across the nanocarbon surfaces. Thereby, virtually unaltered Co-4(pw(9))(2) nanocrystals were supported on three of the four nanocarbons, but unexpectedly the combination of bimetallic undoped Co/Ni@C support with the POM induces partial structural modifications in both materials. Consequently, the derived Co-4(pw(9))(2)@Co/Ni@C electrocatalyst undergoes a noteworthy electroactive surface area relative increase, but at the same time, its intrinsic OER activity declines. This is not an obstacle for this nanocomposite to exhibit (along with Co-4(pw(9))(2)@N,S-Co@C) very significant nominal OER performances: low overpotentials (ca. 400 mV to develop 10 mA cm(-2) of current density), fast kinetics at intermediate overpotentials (Tafel slopes <= 67 mV dec(-1)) and remarkable stability levels. Regardless of the specific results, this preliminary study demonstrates for the first time the POM "bulk" deposition strategy as a useful tool to prepare highly active OER catalysts, and it shows up the dramatic effect that the nanocarbon doping and metal composition has on the resultant POM loading, electrocatalytically active area and OER behavior.

These are remarkably preferred for efficient hydrogen production in energy conversion and storage technologies. Regardless of recent progress, their activity and durability are still far from adequate, due to less visible light effectiveness, wide band gape and high overpotential and low current density. Herein we successfully coupled a novel visible light accessible photo/electrocatalyst, silver-silver bromide doped hollow mesoporous silica-titania (Ag-AgBr/HMST). The syntheses of these composites were carried out using a facile one-pot micro-emulsification method at controlled calcination temperature. The results of the physicochemical characterization indicates that the composite obtained at optimal calcination temperature (550 degrees C), has exceptional morphology, high surface area, and uniformly distributed particles. These features exhibits the illustrious visible light induced photo/electrocatalytic behavior for overall water splitting. The hollow silica-titania provides incredible quality conducting channel, to get better mass loading and boost the charge transportation. While well-built connection of Ag, AgBr with titania, provides well active sites that accomplish obvious photo/electrocatalytic performance with OER current density of 10 mAcm(-2) at 280 mV and HER current density of 65 mAcm(-2) at -173mV. This is almost equal to RuO2 and Pt/C that are very expensive catalyst for water oxidation. Therefore, the present work establishes the first example of hollow mesoporous photo/electrocatalyst for OER and HER water splitting. The outstanding durability prop up the use of mesoporous material for renewable energy application. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zhang, Xiaoshuang; Du, Xiaoqiang								Oxygen vacancies confined in nickel oxide nanoprism arrays for promoted electrocatalytic water splitting								NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY				44	5			1703	1706		10.1039/c9nj05940g				FEB 7 2020	2020	Water electrolysis, as a promising approach for producing clean hydrogen energy from water, has been considered as an efficient way to solve the energy crisis but is greatly limited by the slow dynamics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Hence, we designed a defect engineering method to synthesize NiO nanoprisms with abundant oxygen vacancies as a subject of investigation to study the effect between oxygen vacancies and water splitting performance. Experimental results and theoretical calculation indicate that the NiO nanoprisms with abundant oxygen vacancies (b-NiO) show excellent water splitting performance due to the more exposed active area, enhanced conductivity, higher charge transfer rate and higher adsorption energy of H2O molecules. Moreover, the b-NiO material requires a small cell voltage of 1.59 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is lower than that of (1.70 V) pristine NiO (a-NiO). Our finding highlights the significance of defect engineering in designing high activity materials as robust water splitting catalysts.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000511381800006		
J	DELRIEU, MJ; ROSENGARD, F								CHANGES IN THE S0 AND S1 PROPERTIES DURING DARK-ADAPTATION IN OXYGEN-EVOLVING PHOTOSYSTEM-II-ENRICHED THYLAKOID MEMBRANES								BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA				1057	1			78	88		10.1016/S0005-2728(05)80086-6				MAR 1 1991	1991	Analysis of oxygen and fluorescence flash yield patterns reveal two types of period 4 behavior. Two types of oxygen-evolving center have been characterized, those with few misses which induce fluorescence oscillations (however, instead of misses a small proportion of active centers, about 10%, are lost after each flash of a series) and the others responsible for the highly damped oxygen-yield oscillations (Delrieu, M.J. and Rosengard, F. (1988) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 936, 39-49). In this paper, further investigation of the fluorescence yield patterns shows that in the oxygen-evolving centers responsible for the period 4 fluorescence oscillations (and only in these centers), a change in the S0 and S1 properties develops during dark adaptation, affecting the S state advancement only on the first flash of a series. The miss factor (around 1-4%) was greatly increased on the first flash of a series for the S0 --> S1 and S1 --> S2 transitions (1) when the relatively high flash energy was decreased, (2) during the (short) dark period that followed one or three pre-flashes, (3) after partial Cl- or Ca2+ depletion. There are two possible explanations of the misses on the first flash only: (a) either after the first flash no reaction occurs in a percentage of S0 and S1 state centers and the miss factors are therefore alpha-0 and alpha-1, or (b) a reaction occurs after the first flash, and the reaction results in the formation of inactive S0, S1 and S2 state centers (the miss factors are then alpha-0, alpha-1 and alpha-2). The centers studied represent a minor fraction of the O2-evolving centers at an ambient temperature. In these centers, a structural reorganization in the S0 and S1 states during dark adaptation could account for misses. This process is generally reversed by one flash.									12	0	0	0	12	0	12			0006-3002			WOS:A1991FD72500006

Construction of analogues of these ensembles on heterogeneous supports may aid in the innovative development of artificial catalysts showing efficient and stable reaction patterns. We herein stabilized naturally prevalent undercoordinated iron (UCI) centers on manganese oxides via the interface confinement effect between transition-metal oxides. The created heterostructure showed efficient activation of peroxy-bonds containing peroxymonosulfate (PMS) molecules, with aqueous organic contaminant oxidation efficacy several times that of reference metal oxides. The combined spectroscopic, electrochemical, and in situ measurement results revealed that these interfacial oxygen-deficient UCI sites not only benefited thermodynamically favored PMS accumulation but also facilitated surface-to-surface electronic communication across atomic interface-bonding channels, thus providing a feasible platform to give rise to highly oxidizing (Fe, Mn)-oxo intermediates. Such PMS-activating metal centers in transitional states were sequentially reduced via either direct oxidation of organic substrates or electrophilic attack of other PMS molecules, with reactive singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) generation. This reaction pattern guaranteed preservation of the catalyst structure after the reversible redox cycle, enabling a stable, kinetics enhanced catalytic process.									65	3	0	0	42	0	67			2155-5435			WOS:000424735000044

Higher-operation temperatures bring several advantages: (a) increase of the rate of slow oxygen reactions, (b) improved mass transport, and (c) minimization of the electrolyte (ionic conductor) resistance. However, at the same time, it is expected that degradation processes will be accelerated at such temperatures. In the current work, electrochemistry and in situ mass spectrometry are utilized to investigate how increased temperature affects the rate of (electro)chemical dissolution of platinum. The steady state dissolution rate during potentiostatic polarization decreases to a value below the detection limit after several minutes at all temperatures-dissolution thus remains a transient process controlled by oxide formation kinetics as reported previously for room temperature. Deconvolution of anodic and cathodic dissolution branches in potentiodynamic experiments reveals that the increase in temperature results in higher amounts of platinum being dissolved during oxide formation, while dissolution during oxide reduction decays with increasing temperature. In contrast to most literature reports, the total amount of dissolved platinum during 1 potential cycle is found to decrease with increasing temperature.									63	3	0	0	4	0	63			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000337041700004

Herein, in situ growth of NiFe-borate layered double hydroxide (NiFe-BLDH) nanosheets on waste biomass-derived nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) with hierarchical architecture under microwave hydrothermal conditions is reported. The as-synthesized NiFe-borate layered double hydroxide/nitrogen-doped carbon (NiFe-BLDH/NC) exhibits outstanding OER activity, showing an extremely low overpotential of 243 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a relatively small Tafel slope of 42.7 mV dec(-1), which are superior to the commercial RuO2 and many previously reported NiFe-LDH-based OER electrocatalysts. Additionally, the catalyst also shows remarkable stability with unobvious decrease of current density over a period of 24 h. These excellent catalytic performances could be attributable to the synergistic effects between the conductive NC scaffold and NiFe-BLDH with excellent hydrophilicity caused by the intercalated borate anions, which provide many advantages, such as large surface area, abundant active sites, fast charge and mass transport pathways.

Multiple recent reports suggest that optimized bifunctional catalysts resolve the century-old challenge of ZABs and enable electrochemical rechargeability, but it is still difficult to ponder and scale-up. Herein, a rigorous assessment of electrochemical rechargeability masked by stable voltage profiles is presented. First, polarization testing as an essential technique for rapidly benchmarking the electrochemical performance of ZABs is evaluated. Then, the cycling stability tests at different depth of discharge (DOD) show that the Zn depletion rate per cycle increases significantly with increasing DOD, reaching 10% at a DOD of 50%. Further, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry is introduced for in-situ monitoring oxygen released during charging. Stable voltage profiles may miss critical information indicating effective charging, especially with transition metal oxides as catalysts and cycling using small DOD, the cycling process may involve only valence conversion of transition metals rather than oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Finally, electrolyte changes masked by the stable voltage profile are investigated. Hopefully, this work provides useful guidelines for realizing the electrochemical rechargeability of air-based batteries including ZABs.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000842883700001

The effects of introducing IrO2 interlayer were analyzed systematically by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and accelerated service life test. Our results showed that the presence of IrO2 interlayer on the Ti substrate promoted the electrodes' property effectively. In contrast with the traditional Ti/Sb-SnO2 electrode, Ti/IrO2/Sb-SnO2 electrode possesses smaller grains and more compact morphology structure. Then the changes of oxygen evolution potential (OEP) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) on the electrodes were discussed. Anodic stability test results showed that the introduction of IrO2 interlayer in the oxide coating produced a significant increase in stability. The accelerated service life of Ti/IrO2/Sb-SnO2 electrode was almost 30 times longer than that of Ti/Sb-SnO2 electrode.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000593970300021

Among the biomass derivatives, glycerol, which is a by-product of biodiesel, is an attractive alternative to water because it is easily oxidized at a potential lower than that of water. In this work, we report a novel CeO2-decorated Ce-doped ZnO nanowire (NW) photoanode, fabricated via hydrothermal and pulsed laser deposition processes, for efficient PEC glycerol oxidation and hydrogen production. The Ce dopant in the ZnO array improves the charge separation, light-harvesting, and adsorption of glycerol, by providing oxygen vacancies and active sites for PEC water splitting by glycerol. The operation stability of our CeO2-decorated Ce-doped ZnO NW photoanode is enhanced and its photocurrent density is retained even after 10 h. In addition, the amount of evolved hydrogen produced by the CeO2/Ce-doped ZnO photoelectrode is two times higher than that of a bare ZnO electrode. Through our results, we confirm the efficient hydrogen evolution via Ce utilization.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000830666300001

It is synthesized with a facile templating-engaged synthetic strategy and exhibits outstanding OER catalytic performance including high activity and good durability in alkaline medium. It affords a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 291 mV with small Tafel slope of 62 mV dec(-1), which significantly outperforms the benchmarking RuO2 catalyst. The outstanding OER performance is found to be arising from its integrated advantages of the modulated electronic structure, abundant active sites, high electric conductivity, and large surface area endowed by its unique heterostructure and composition. This work exemplifies a feasible route to designing heterogeneous nanomaterials and enriches the OER electrocatalytic application of transition metal selenide-based hybrid materials.									34	1	0	0	1	0	34			2168-0485			WOS:000526356300039

However, due to the electrically insulating property of Li2O2, a typical discharge product in Li-O-2 batteries, high overpotential is inevitable upon charge. Nonetheless, catalysts could regulate the electrochemical formation pathways of Li2O2, and its morphology is closely bound with the energy required to dissociate. Meanwhile, in addition to Li2O2, alternative discharge products with inherently low dissociation energy can be produced by specific catalysts. Here, fundamental oxygen reduction routes in Li-O-2 batteries are focused on, catalyst-dependent geometry formation of Li2O2 is presented, and geometry-related charge kinetics are disscussed. Products formed under specific catalysts are further explored with an emphasis on LiO2. Future directions to in situ study the electrocatalytic mechanism are subsequently proposed, and an energy system design based on oxygen redox reactions is conceived to provide new perspectives for future electrochemical energy technologies.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2699-9412			WOS:000783861500005

However, severe lattice oxygen loss inevitably induces irreversible Li migration in both transition metal (TM) and Li layers, which degrades the stability of the Li-O-Li configuration, resulting in serious structure distortion and capacity decay. Herein, a Li-O-Na configuration was first introduced in Li-based layered oxides by Na substitution within TM layers, which not only obtained a discharge capacity of 232 mAh g(-1) boosted by oxygen redox reactions but also achieved superior structural and electrochemical stability upon cycling (capacity retention of 83.2% after 1000 cycles). Moreover, comprehensive analyses of anionic/cationic redox activities clarify the underlying charge compensation mechanisms upon cycling. Altogether, these findings demonstrated that the Li-O-Na configuration can be regarded as an effective structure to achieve stable oxygen redox chemistry within Li-based cathode materials.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2380-8195			WOS:000819574500001

Herein, effective CO2 photoconversion to CH4 with high selectivity up to 96.7% is achieved over oxygen-deficient Bi-2 MoO6 under visible-light. Various characterizations and DFT calculations indicated that well-designed oxygen vacancies (OVs) on the {001} surface of Bi2MoO6 can not only enhance light harvesting and e(-)/h(+) separation, but favor CO2 adsorption in a special bidentate carbonate mode, which thermodynamically supports the further hydrogenation of intermediate *CO to generate CH4. Based on the in-situ infrared spectroscopy analysis, the CO2 adsorption modes and reaction intermediates of two pathways over Bi2MoO6 with or without OVs were figured out.

However, a large overpotential for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode minimizes the energy efficiency of these devices. In this context, ORR catalysts based on 3d transition metal oxides have attracted significant attention as affordable and highly active catalysts with potential to replace expensive noble metal catalysts (e.g., Pt). In this study, the ORR catalytic activities of 'oxygen-excess' perovskite La1-xSrxMnO3+delta (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4), with both higher activity and stability compared to a regular perovskite, i.e., La0.8Sr0.2MnO3, were investigated and the performances were evaluated with respect to changes in the Mn valence number, amount of cation vacancies and Mn-O bond length. Sr substitution can affect the formation of Mn4+ ions and modulate the cation vacancies, thus changing the length of the Mn-O bond. The lowest overpotential was observed for La0.8Sr0.2MnO3+delta, where the Mn-O bond length was the shortest, resulting in the highest activity. Overall, this work provides guidelines to improve the ORR catalytic activity of Mn-based perovskites.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000814238300001

The pristine octahedral Pt-Ni nanoparticles (NPs) showed Pt-rich comers/edges and slightly concave Ni-rich {111} facets. Time-resolved image series unequivocally revealed that upon annealing up to 500 degrees C, the Pt-rich surface atoms at the corners/edges diffused onto and subsequently covered the concave Ni-rich {111} surfaces, leading to perfectly flat Pt-rich 1111) surfaces with Ni-rich subsurface layers. This was further corroborated by in situ aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. Our results propose a feasible approach to construct shaped Pt alloy nanoparticles with Pt-rich 11111 surfaces and Ni-rich subsurface layers that are expected to be catalytically active and stable for the oxygen reduction reaction, thus providing important implications for rational synthesis of durably highly active shaped Pt alloy fuel cell electrocatalysts.									68	6	0	0	5	0	70			2155-5435			WOS:000369774900025

Herein, we introduce N atoms into MoS2 for manufacturing sulfur vacancies to improve the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics of rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries. The obtained results show that N doping opened the crystal distance space of N-MoS2, reduced the charge transfer resistance and simultaneously induces Mo-N bonds and a large number of sulfur vacancies. The assembled Li-O-2 batteries with N-MoS2 as the cathode electrocatalyst deliver discharge specific capacity of 5205.5 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 100 mA g(-1), which is much higher than the MoS2 (2600.3 mAh g(-1)). It also shows excellent cyclic performance with 224 cycles at the current density of 200 mA g(-1) within a capacity limitation of 1000 mAh g(-1). Overall, the as-developed N-MoS2 could be regarded as a promising cathode electrocatalyst for Li-O-2 batteries. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, an antiperovskite Ni4N/VN heterostructure anchored on nitrogen-doped graphene (Ni4N/VN-NG) was designed and synthesized. Both experimental and theoretical results suggest that the electronic coupling between Ni4N and VN can regulate the electronic structure of the catalyst for promoted catalytic kinetics. Remarkably, the Ni4N/VN-NG exhibited excellent bifunctional catalytic activity and stability with an overvoltage difference of 0.75 V. The ZABs with Ni4N/VN-NG as the air cathode can achieve a high-power density of 140 mW cm(-2) and a long-term operational stability for 180 h, superior to the battery with commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. This work proposes the construction of pretransition metal and post-transition metal nitride heterojunctions to promote ORR/OER activity and provides a new strategy for the rational design and synthesis of efficient oxygen bifunctional electrocatalysts for ZABs.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			2168-0485			WOS:000731070700001

In this report, CoO/Co nanoparticles are conformally decorated on the surface of CNTs by a facile chemical bath deposition followed by thermal annealing. In a simulated air environment, Li-air battery with the CNTs@CoO/Co electrocatalyst exhibits a dramatic reduction of charge voltage overpotentials (0.39 V) and good cycling stability (110 cycles) as compared with that made with bare CNTs. The superior electrochemical performances are ascribed to the prior and strong absorption of LiO2 on the surface of CoO/Co, which can alleviate the formation of side-products, then leading to a decreased overpotential. The synergistic effect between CoO/Co and CNTs can also provide more catalytic sites for the ORR/OER, promoting the formation/decomposition reversibility of Li2O2. These results confirm that the CNTs@CoO/Co electrode can be a promising electrocatalyst for Li-air batteries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The production of H2O2 by electrocatalytic 2e(-) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has drawn considerable research attention, with a view to replacing the currently established anthraquinone process. Electrocatalysts with low cost, high activity, high selectivity, and superior stability are in high demand to realize precise control over electrochemical H2O2 synthesis by 2e(-) ORR and the feasible commercialization of this system. This Review introduces a comprehensive overview of non-noble metal-based catalysts for electrochemical oxygen reduction to afford H2O2, providing an insight into catalyst design and corresponding reaction mechanisms. It starts with an in-depth discussion on the origins of 2e(-)/4e(-) selectivity towards ORR for catalysts. Recent advances in design strategies for non-noble metal-based catalysts, including carbon nanomaterials and transition metal-based materials, for electrochemical oxygen reduction to H2O2 are then discussed, with an emphasis on the effects of electronic structure, nanostructure, and surface properties on catalytic performance. Finally, future challenges and opportunities are proposed for the further development of H2O2 electrogeneration through 2e(-) ORR, from the standpoints of mechanistic studies and practical application.									16	4	0	0	2	0	16			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000619542700001	33587818

Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) can convert low-grade organic matter to hydrogen gas with low energy consumption and have gained a growing interest in the past decade. Cathode catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) present a major challenge for the development and future applications of MECs. An ideal cathode catalyst should be catalytically active, simple to synthesize, durable in a complex environment, and cost-effective. A variety of noble-metal free catalysts have been developed and investigated for HER in MECs, including Nickel and its alloys, MoS2, carbon-based catalysts and biocatalysts. MECs in turn can serve as a research platform to study the durability of the HER catalysts. This personal account has reviewed, analyzed, and discussed those catalysts with an emphasis on synthesis and modification, system performance and potential for practical applications. It is expected to provide insights into the development of HER catalysts towards MEC applications.									20	0	0	0	7	0	20			1527-8999	1528-0691		WOS:000407586800001	28375578

The samples were studied by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, BET surface area, CTEM, analytical electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction. A reaction occurs between the two phases, leading to a mixture of Fe2 (MoO4)3, Sb2O4, FeSbO4 and MoO3 with a significant increase of the surface area. Taking into account previous results, the present work suggests that the ability of alpha-Sb2O4 to produce oxygen spillover facilitates the oxidation of Sb3+ to Sb5+ allowing the solid state transformation to FeSbO4 to take place.					12TH INTERNATIONAL SYMP ON THE RELATIVITY OF SOLIDS12TH INTERNATIONAL SYMP ON THE RELATIVITY OF SOLIDS	SEP 24-30, 1992SEP 24-30, 1992	MINIST EDUC & CIENCIA; UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID; COMUNIDAD AUTONOMA MADRID; REAL SOC ESPANOLA QUIMICA, GRP ESPECIALIZADO QUIMICA ESTADO SOLIDO; CONSEJO SUPER INVESTIGAC CIENT; CARBUROS METALICOSMINIST EDUC & CIENCIA; UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID; COMUNIDAD AUTONOMA MADRID; REAL SOC ESPANOLA QUIMICA, GRP ESPECIALIZADO QUIMICA ESTADO SOLIDO; CONSEJO SUPER INVESTIGAC CIENT; CARBUROS METALICOS	MADRID, SPAINMADRID, SPAIN	4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0167-2738			WOS:A1993LZ39400113

The results of the experiments demonstrated that the surface area, specific capacitance, and electrochemical performance of Co3O4 are all influenced by Fe3+ content. The FexCo3-xO4 with x = 1 sample exhibits a higher BET surface (87.45 m(2)/g) than that of the pristine Co3O4 (59.4 m(2)/g). Electrochemical measurements of the electrode carried out in 3 M KOH reveal a high specific capacitance of 153 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g for x = 0.6 and 684 F/g at a 2 mV/s scan rate for x = 1.0 samples. In terms of electrocatalytic performance, the electrode (x = 1.0) displayed a low overpotential of 266 mV (at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2)) along with 52 mV/dec Tafel slopes in the oxygen evolution reaction. Additionally, the overpotential of 132 mV (at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2)) and 109 mV with 52 mV/dec Tafel slope were obtained for x = 0.6 sample towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). According to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements and the density functional theory (DFT) study, the addition of Fe3+ increased the conductivity at the electrode-electrolyte interface, which substantially impacted the high activity of the iron-doped cobalt oxide. The electrochemical results revealed that the mesoporous Fe-doped Co3O4 nanostructure could be used as potential electrode material in the high-performance electrochemical capacitor and water-splitting catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2227-9717		WOS:000742895300001

Detailed structural and electrochemical characterization, including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), was conducted to assess the electrocatalytic properties of these Ni NW arrays for the O-2 evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH. Detailed structural analysis showed that Ni NWs have a diameter of ca. 350 nm and a mean 80 nm average distance between the NW center. For the longest NWs (20 mu m long), the ratio between the pore opening and pore length is 0.4%. From detailed HR-TEM and EELS analysis providing information on the chemical state of atoms from quantitative analysis of the signals, Ni NWs are composed of a Ni metallic core surrounded by a Ni(OH)(2) layer that thickens from 10 to 20 nm after extensive electrochemical tests. Three different methods, namely, SEM geometry measurements, the alpha-Ni(OH)(2) charge method, and the capacitance method, were used to assess how the current varies with the NW length. The three different methods are all in agreement, and the current increases with length (or mass) precisely and only because of the surface area effect. The most surprising result is that the OER process occurs with exactly the same intrinsic catalytic activity at the bottom of these deep pores, and gas is evolved without any significant effects of electrolyte resistance, mass transport of dissolved oxygen, or bubble occlusion of the pores. Accordingly, vertically aligned 1D NWs can be used as an effective platform that mitigates the negative effects of gas evolution. Increasing the intrinsic activity by incorporating more active materials will further improve this type of electrode.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1932-7447			WOS:000456350600011

These weathering processes, which are denoted as LTO (Low Temperature Oxidation), decrease the calorific value of the coal and emit different gases such as carbon oxides (CO, CO2), water vapor, hydrogen (H-2), and also some low-molecular-weight organic gases (C1-5). Some of these gases are toxic and flammable. The mechanism by which the molecular oxygen interacts with the coal macromolecule is thought to occur in several steps. The main concept is that a chain of radical reactions takes place; however, the exact underlying mechanism is not yet clear. We succeeded in identifying various carbon-centered radical species, depending on the coal rank and the degree of oxidation and suggested a new scheme for the formation of radicals via the coal oxidation process.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000451351500026	30328847

Here, we show that via incorporation of lithium ion into iridium oxide, the thus obtained amorphous iridium oxide (Li-IrOx) demonstrates outstanding water oxidation activity with an OER current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at 270 mV overpotential for 10 h of continuous operation in acidic electrolyte. DFT calculations show that lithium incorporation into iridium oxide is able to lower the activation barrier for OER X-ray absorption characterizations indicate that both amorphous Li-IrOx and rutile IrO2 own similar [IrO6] octahedron units but have different [IrO6] octahedron connection modes. Oxidation of iridium to higher oxidation states along with shrinkage in the Ir-O bond was observed by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy on amorphous Li-IrOx, but not on rutile IrO2 under OER operando conditions. The much more "flexible" disordered [IrO6] octahedrons with higher oxidation states in amorphous Li-IrOx as compared to the periodically interconnected "rigid" [IrO6] octahedrons in crystalline IrO2 are able to act as more electrophilic centers and thus effectively promote the fast turnover of water oxidation.									187	12	0	0	11	0	190			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000459642000035	30673269

These nanofins were observed growing perpendicular to the carbon nanosphere surface in random orientations and high resolution transmission electron microscope confirmed 2D layers. The PEM fuel cell test showed enhanced electrochemical activity with good stability, generating over 8.5 W.mgPt(-1) as compared to standard carbon black of 7.4 W.mgPt(-1) under normal operating conditions. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy confirmed that the performance improvement is highly due to the excellent water management of the MoS2 lamellar network, which facilitates water retention at low current density and flood prevention at high current density. Reliability test further demonstrated that these nanofins are highly stable in the electrochemical reaction and is an excellent ORR catalyst support.									24	0	0	0	1	0	24			2045-2322			WOS:000384606400001	27302135	
J	Wan, S.; Li, Y.; Xu, L.; Zhang, W.; Cao, R.								Autologous Mn oxides as electrocatalysts to identify the origin of the water oxidation activity								MATERIALS TODAY SUSTAINABILITY				17						100106	10.1016/j.mtsust.2021.100106				MAR 2022	2022	Different manganese oxides have been widely reported as catalysts for water oxidation. However, the best structure of Mn oxides for electrocatalytic water oxidation is still under debate. The convergence of different physical properties in those Mn oxides makes the assignment of the origin of the activity becoming confused. To eliminate the diverse influence factors among the Mn oxides for water oxidation, three sister Mn oxides (Mn2O3, Mn3O4, and MnO) are synthesized from the same parent precursor. The autologous Mn oxides have similarities in general physical properties, and the difference in phase structure becomes the only significant factor of their diversity. Through electrochemical analysis, Mn2O3 has the best catalytic performance among the Mn oxides. Based on this ideal platform, it is straightforwardly observed that the easy generation of Mn-III in Mn2O3 is the origin of the higher catalytic activity for water oxidation. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study brown coal char prepared front brown coal (coal-mine Novaky) by drying and devolatilization, and commercial black coal char (provided by U.S. Steel Kosice) were used. Particles were combusted to different degrees of burnout at all initial temperature of 800degreesC in a low oxygen containing atmosphere (5 vol%).It was shown that the combustion of both types of coal chars proceeds via the same shell progressive mechanism, despite differences in their original internal pore Structure. The internal Surface area of the brown coal char particles mainly belongs to the region of micropores, while for the black coal char is typical its macropore structure. Inside the brown coal particle cores pore Structure evolution was observed. This change of the Structure was caused by the reaction between solid carbon and carbon dioxide, due to which the specific surface area in the region of micropores significantly increased.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1388-6150			WOS:000221298100026

Addition of ammonium nitrate to the sprayed solution increases the crystallization. We report herein the preparation and characterization of such films using X-ray diffraction, FTIR reflectance and transmission spectroscopy, W-vis spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, oxidation power, magnetic and conductimetric measurements. The copper ions are distributed over the A and B sites of the inverted spinel lattice and the cobalt ions are postulated to be in the low spin state. Oxide electrochemical stability has been determined by cyclic voltammetry. Copper cobalt oxide is oxidized and reduced prior to oxygen evolution through a reaction involving Co3O4 formation on the surface of cobaltite.

This specificity has been revealed, in particular, in its influence on the dissolution/crystallization kinetics of ferric hydroxide in alkaline electrolytes using Mossbauer spectroscopic measurements. The conclusion is drawn that lithium hydroxide suppresses the two main processes which lead to alkaline battery nickel hydroxide electrode degradation upon accumulation of the iron impurity during cycling, ie, (i) the well-known decrease in anodic oxygen evolution overpotential (equivalent to a lower efficiency of the charging process) due to electrocatalysis by iron species, and (ii) the formation of a certain ferric oxyhydroxide structure (alpha-FeOOH), which affects the kinetics of phase transitions in the electrode active material, via recrystallization of labile poorly crystallized and/or amorphous forms.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0013-4686			WOS:A1996TH13000010

The most efficient catalysts for this reaction in acidic media are Pt based, but the high cost of Pt limits its practical applications. We developed a novel matrix architecture in which a trace amount of Pt is alloyed in situ with Ru nanoparticles uniformly and partially embedded in porous carbon spheres. The synthetic procedure is simple and efficient. Surface enrichment of metallic Pt nanoclusters on PtRu alloy nanoparticles results in weak bonding with hydrogen and rapid hydrated proton dissociation. These effects significantly increase the electrocatalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution process. This robust catalyst, with a Pt loading 99.9% less than that of a commercial Pt-based catalyst, gave a high turnover frequency (4.03 H-2 s(-1)), a small Tafel slope (27.2 mV dec(-1)), and comparable overpotentials (19.7 mV and 43.1 mV), as well as achieved current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), i.e., better than those obtained with commercial Pt/C catalyst, in 0.5 M H2SO4. This structure prevents nanoparticles from dissolving, agglomerating, and detaching during long-term operation; therefore there was no obvious decrease in catalytic activity after continuous reaction.									167	10	0	0	12	0	169			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000432599100011

Different techniques were used to characterize the nanoparticles. The crystalline nature of nanoparticles was confirmed by X-Rays Diffraction analysis (XRD). The results revealed that with the introduction of Pr and Ni ions in TiO2 lattice the particle size decrease from 18.01 to 9.02 nm accomplished by the enhancement in surface area of the nanoparticles. The results obtained UV-Vis diffused-reflectance (DRS) spectroscopy of co-doped nanoparticles demonstrated a reduction in the bandgap compared with the pure TiO2. The variation in surface defects and oxygen vacancies were evaluated using Photoluminescence (PL) studies, which exhibited a gradual reduction in PL intensity upon the addition of dopants in the TiO2 Lattice. Furthermore, the exciton recombination was also investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which showed the reduction in the recombination rate in doped nanoparticles. The photocatalytic activity of prepared nanoparticles was tested on three azo dyes (reactive blue-19 (RB-19), reactive orange-13 (RO-13), and reactive blue-13 (RB-13)). The experimental results showed that 99.0% of RB-19, 85.0% for RB-13, and 70.0% RO-13 were degraded after a small interval of irradiation. The adsorption of dye on the photo-catalytic support was checked by performing the experiments under different conditions by varying the pH values and temperature. Furthermore, the catalysts also exhibit remarkable activity for the overall water splitting in an alkaline solution with Ni-Pr-3 catalyst being the best, which recorded onset overpotential of 330 mV and a Tafel slope of 76 mV dec(-1) for Oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It is also clear that Ni-Pr-3 (with 5% nickel and 3% Pr) content is more active in the OER process showing comparatively lower over-potential value at 10 mA/cm(2) than Ni-5 and TiO2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2190-5509	2190-5517		WOS:000693472900001

Formaldehyde is adsorbed in two states, a monolayer phase and a multilayer phase which were distinguishable by both TPRS and XPS. The saturated monolayer (corresponding to 8.06 x 10(14) molecules cm-2) desorbed at 134 K and the multilayer phase (which could not be saturated) desorbed at 112 K. The only other reaction products observed at higher temperatures were CO and H-2 produced in desorption limited processes and these reached a maximum upon saturation of the formaldehyde monolayer. The desorption spectrum of hydrogen was found to be perturbed by the presence of CO as reported by Weinberg and coworkers. It is proposed that local lifting of the clean surface (1 x 2) reconstruction is responsible for this behaviour. Analysis of the TPRS and XPS peak areas demonstrated that on the clean surface approximately 50% of the adsorbed monolayer dissociated with the remainder desorbing intact. Reaction of formaldehyde with preadsorbed oxygen resulted in the formation of H2O (hydroxyl recombination) and CO2 (decomposition of formate) desorbing at 200 and 262 K, respectively. The CO and H2 desorption peaks were both smaller relative to formaldehyde decomposition on the clean surface and in particular, H2 desorbed in a reaction limited process associated with decomposition of the formate species. No evidence was found for methane or hydrocarbon evolution in the present study under any circumstances. The results of this investigation are discussed in the light of our earlier work on the decomposition of methanol on the same platinum surface.									29	0	0	0	0	0	29			0039-6028			WOS:A1990EV01400017

This increase is thought to have occurred in six steps, 2.65, 2.45, 1.8, 0.6, 0.3 and 0.04 billion years ago, with a possible seventh event identified at 1.2 billion years ago. Here we show that the timing of these steps correlates with the amalgamation of Earth's land masses into supercontinents. We suggest that the continent-continent collisions required to form supercontinents produced supermountains. In our scenario, these supermountains eroded quickly and released large amounts of nutrients such as iron and phosphorus into the oceans, leading to an explosion of algae and cyanobacteria, and thus a marked increase in photosynthesis, and the photosynthetic production of O-2. Enhanced sedimentation during these periods promoted the burial of a high fraction of organic carbon and pyrite, thus preventing their reaction with free oxygen, and leading to sustained increases in atmospheric oxygen.									249	37	0	0	30	0	276			1752-0894	1752-0908		WOS:000258894600022

However, particularly water electrolysis still has a shadow existence compared to currently used methods for mass production of hydrogen. All known materials currently exploited as anodes for electrocatalytically initiated water-splitting suffer from high overpotentials and substantial mass loss during long term operation in acidic media. Low electrode stability affects operating and maintenance costs and together with high overpotentials directly lowers the overall efficiency of electrocatalytically driven splitting of water. In circumventing these problems, scientists and engineers are currently modifying electrode materials. We chose a completely different path and modified the electrolyte. An electrolysis set up, that consists of a Ni42 stainless steel anode and of hematite which is suspended in high concentration in sulfuric acid and acts as the electrolyte, exhibits oxygen evolution electrocatalysis at extremely low potential (1.26 V vs. RHE; 0.5 M H2SO4, j = 30 mA cm(-2)). If implemented in a suitable electrolyzer, an ultralow cell voltage of 1.6 V and an almost quantitative charge to oxygen + hydrogen conversion rate can be achieved. Remarkably, the negligible mass loss of the anode which consists exclusively of non-platinum group metals (non-PGM) during 100 h of operation. Experiments aimed at clarifying the mechanism suggest that Fe2O3 is converted to a Fe(ii)/Fe(iii) oxide species on the cathode which is then reconverted to Fe2O3 upon release of molecular oxygen when touching the anode. As a result, the oxygen-evolving centers are likely to be on the oxide particles rather than on the electrode. This proposed mechanism would explain the low potential of the OER electrode (+1.26 V vs. RHE at j = 30 mA cm(-2)) that could not be explained convincingly by an assumed direct oxidation of water molecules.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000536690000041

We succeeded in obtaining NiCo2NS with a hollow capsule structure through the self-sacrificing template method, which has a larger specific surface area and can provide more active sites for electrocatalysis relative to his solid. The introduction of S can change the valence distribution of N and the electronic structure of the M-N bond, so that NiCo2NS exhibits excellent performance in the overpotential and stability of the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. It shows an overpotential of 154 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a half-wave potential of 0.76 V. When used as a bi-functional catalyst in zinc-air batteries, it exhibits good stability within 400 h. The flexible battery assembled by NiCo2NS also shows excellent performance, and can be cycled stably for 20 h. The current maintains good stability when it is bent at different angles during the cycle.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000764021300001	35166404

Catalysts for this two-electron reduction pathway with high selectivity are required to achieve industrialization. Here, we disclose an inexpensive metal-free catalyst that is synthesized from commercial carbon black (CB) with a one-step plasma method for the affordable electrochemical generation of hydrogen peroxide in 100% Faradaic efficiency. This catalyst shows a high onset potential (0.1 mA cm(-2) at 0.80 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and the highest mass activity (300 A g(-1) at 0.60 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) among state-of-the-art catalysts. The performance could be maintained after the removal of oxygen-containing groups. Microscopic and spectroscopic characterizations as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the performance comes from the defective structure after plasma treatment.									35	1	0	0	2	0	34			2155-5435			WOS:000621598700044

The evolution of six main functional groups in two coking coals with different ranks was investigated by in situ Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) during non-isothermal pyrolysis in nitrogen gas flow. Different stages in various temperature ranges were proposed based on the evolution of functional groups during coking coal pyrolysis. The evolution of aromatic groups and C=O between the two coking coals had the largest difference because of the different coal ranks. The correlations among the evolution of the six functional groups during pyrolysis were also investigated to identify the possible reaction mechanism of coking coal pyrolysis. There were three processes, including evaporation of small molecules, decomposition of oxygen-containing groups, and devolatilization of aliphatic groups during pyrolysis. One-way transport and n th-order chemical reaction models were the main kinetic models of decomposition of the aliphatic groups, C=O, C-O, and OH. The activation energies of the functional group decomposition in two coking coals were in the range of 25.1-219.4 kJ/mol and 12.3-167.0 kJ/mol. The results that describe the pyrolysis process of coking coals with respect to functional groups can improve the understanding of the pyrolysis mechanism of coking coal and facilitate the development of clean coal technology.									28	4	0	0	2	0	31			0165-2370	1873-250X		WOS:000445306600038

In this paper, a simple one-step pyrolysis method was used to successfully synthesize a binary FeCo-Co/NC catalyst with FeCo and Co nanoparticles encapsulated in N-doped carbon nanotubes. This structure exhibits great characteristics: it has a variety of active species (FeCo, Co, NC), and there is close combination between these active species (FeCo, Co, NC). Electrochemical studies have shown that the initial potential of FeCo-Co/NC during ORR process is 0.93 V, the half-wave potential is 0.808 V, and the limiting current density is 4.94 mA cm(-2). In the OER process, at an anode current density of 10 mA cm(-2), an overpotential of only 353 mV is shown; a lower Tafel slope and good durability are also observed. Moreover, the zinc-air battery in preparation can be cycled for as long as 2000 times. This provides a new method for the preparation of high-efficiency dual-function electrocatalysts for OER and ORR.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000693764900001

Investigations were carried out to determine the origin of this gas production indicated that carbon dioxide production could be caused by the oxidation of iron sulphide minerals (pyrite and marcasite) and reaction of sulphuric acid with carbonates minerals to produce carbon dioxide gas. These reactions have produced highly mineralised mine water with circum-neutral pH values and a low content of dissolved metals and metalloids. Through a bibliographic study, similar neutral mine drainage has been observed and assumptions were made on the reactions which could take place.

However, most bioinspired catalysts are inefficient at neutral pH and functional similarity to the oxygen-evolving complex has been rarely achieved with manganese. Here we report the regulation of proton-coupled electron transfer involved in water oxidation by manganese oxides. Pyridine and its derivatives, which have pK(a) values intermediate to the water ligand bound to manganese(II) and manganese(III), are used as proton-coupled electron transfer induction reagents. The induction of concerted proton-coupled electron transfer is demonstrated by the detection of deuterium kinetic isotope effects and compliance of the reactions with the libido rule. Although proton-coupled electron transfer regulation is essential for the facial redox change of manganese in photosystem II, most manganese oxides impair these regulatory mechanisms. Thus, the present findings may provide a new design rationale for functional analogues of the oxygen-evolving complex for efficient water splitting at neutral pH.									120	4	0	0	14	0	121			2041-1723			WOS:000338840500003	24977746

The oxygen atoms from the native SiOx layer activate the gold-mediated catalytic decomposition of the entire graphene layer, resulting in the formation of direct contact between the Au and the Si substrate.

The introduction of A-site deficiency can help the formation of highly mobile oxygen vacancies and remarkably enhance the reducibility of Ni nanoparticles, thus significantly increasing electronic conductivity and catalytic activity simultaneously.

HIGH TEMPERATURE MATERIAL PROCESSES				4	3			365	378						2000	2000	In order to quantify the energy transfer from the reactive flow to a surface, determination of recombination and accommodation coefficients (respectively gamma and beta coefficients) is required. The following work concerns atomic oxygen flow recombining on silicon carbide. The gamma coefficient is measured in a pulsed oxygen plasma reactor in non equilibrium conditions, using an actinometric method, whereas the beta coefficient is determined in a micro-wave plasma reactor, using a calorimetric method. The beta gamma coefficient gives also the energetic transfer to the surface during the recombination reaction. The experimental study is undertaken on silicon carbide which presents interesting properties as refractory material. The measurements are performed on a large temperature range (300 - 1123 K) in order to point out a change in the recombination mechanism when the surface temperature rises. At the same time, the chemical structure of the material is followed by different analysis techniques (ESCA, SIMS and SEM) and shows a modification of the chemical composition of silicon carbide resulting from oxidation, ablation of the surface and diffusion of oxygen into the bulk material.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1093-3611			WOS:000089288400005

To address the issues of implanting various gas sensors into commercial batteries, here a novel method is developed to fast operando monitoring gas evolution via equipping non-dispersive infrared multi-gases sensors into a sealed tank, where real commercial batteries with one open end could be settled for operating. The generated CO2 concentration is strongly linked with both voltage and temperature, while the concentrations of CH4 and C2H4 are solely dependent on temperature. As a typical trace gas, evolution behaviors of CO2 have been related to O-2 generation from LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 positive electrode, implying stable CO2 release below a critical voltage of 4.5 V. By tracking CO2 concentration, an increased amount of Li2CO3 was monitored on the surface of graphite negative electrode during discharge process at different temperatures and cutoff voltages, which contributes to the component variation of solid electrolyte interfaces. Such operando techniques promise a platform for well understanding the interaction of side reactions linked with gas evolution between positive and negative electrodes in commercial LIBs.

However, most of the methods used to prepare these bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts require high temperatures and exhibit low yields, and it is therefore difficult to predetermine the active sites qualitatively and quantitatively. Here, we propose the use of atomically dispersed metal centers coordinated to diimine moieties of conjugated polymers as bifunctional catalysts without further modification (pyrolysis or composite formation) for Li-O-2 battery applications. Poly(bisiminoacenaphthenequinone) (BIAN) iron complex (BP-Fe) catalysts showed high OER activities, which enabled 100% coulombic efficiency for 160 galvanostatic charge discharge cycles with a capacity limit of 500 mAh/g at a current density of 250 mA/g. The overpotential corresponding to charging was as low as similar to 1.0 V and exhibited almost no change in discharge overpotential across 160 cycles. Additionally, it showed a commendable rate capability with only a 170 mV increase in charge overpotential when the charge.discharge rate was increased from 100 to 500 mA/g.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0032-3896	1349-0540		WOS:000849146000002

In this Perspective, recent findings in electrocatalyst development for the next generation of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers at scale are discussed. We discuss opportunities to create catalyst architectures, the importance to demonstrate electrode manufacturing tools, and how useful advanced characterization methods shall, in the short term, allow large-scale deployment of water splitting devices with higher efficiency, acceptable durability, and low cost. We envision next-generation PEM cells permitting a transformational change in the chemical industry by the manufacturing of low-cost hydrogen.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000820381900001

During these reactions, the oxygen consumption and the variation of the normal and spectral emissivity of the surface are measured (lambda = 2.3-mu-m). If parabolic growth of a homogeneous oxide film is observed for T(ox) < 1000 K, it is shown that for T(ox) > 1010 K there is a porous layer of alpha'-WO3 tetragonal oxide growth. With a theoretical model based on the optical theory of thin films, it is shown how, from the variation in epsilon-lambda-theta during the reaction, it is nevertheless possible to calculate the complex refractive indices of this alpha'-WO3 porous oxide.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0040-6090			WOS:A1991FW72200002

In this work, by using solid Co-glycerate (CoG) nanospheres as sacrificial template, various CoG hierarchical structures were successfully fabricated in water/ethanol mixed solution via a solvothermal reaction. The microstructure and morphology of obtained CoG nanospheres could be simply tuned by varying the water content. After a subsequent phosphorization reaction, multi-structural CoG was converted into hierarchical CoP nanospheres with well-preserved morphology. The essential influence of water on the microstructure of CoG was discussed in detail. Owing to the ultrathin nanosheet subunits, the as-prepared CoP nanospheres exhibited high performance with overpotential of 121 mV to achieve the current densities of 10 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope of 56 mV dec(-1), and good stability under acidic condition. This work could provide an effective strategy to fabricate metal phosphide electrocatalysts with delicate hierarchical nanostructure for the application of HER.

Electronic structure and energetics of these model compounds were thoroughly investigated. The thermodynamically lowest energy pathway on the dimer catalyst proceeds through a nucleophilic attack of a solvent water molecule to Co(V)-O radical moiety. The lowest energy pathway on the cubane catalyst involves a geminal coupling of Co(V)-O radical oxo group with bridging oxo sites. Model systems were found to be very sensitive to the positions of ligands and to the hydrogen-bonding environment leading to different isomer energies.					17th International Symposium on Small Particles and Inorganic Clusters (ISSPIC)17th International Symposium on Small Particles and Inorganic Clusters (ISSPIC)	SEP 07-12, 2014SEP 07-12, 2014		Fukuoka, JAPANFukuoka, JAPAN	38	1	0	0	7	0	38			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000355158400036

Herein, we systematically screened the capacity of a sequence of representative transition metal-N-3 (TM-N-3) centers supported on blue phosphorus (TM-N-3@beta-P) as NRR catalysts by using of density functional theory (DFT). Our results show that W-N-3 center supported on blue phosphorus (W-N-3@beta-P) exhibits an excellent catalytic performance with an ultra-low limiting potential of -0.02 V, while the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) can be suppressed on this catalyst.

The polarization experiments show that the electrode reactions include oxygen reduction, hydrogen evolution and palladium deposition. The oxygen reduction is always mass transfer-controlled. Deposits obtained with current densities higher than the limiting one are powdery. The current efficiency also drops under these conditions. The variation of the electrode potential during current pulses reveals that hydrogen desorption occurs during pulse-off periods. This hydrogen desorption refreshes the electrode surface and facilitates hydrogen reduction in the next pulse. It explains the severe drop in current efficiency in pulse plating with long pulse-off times. This explanation is also supported by the morphology observations.									21	2	0	0	0	0	22			0022-0728			WOS:A1992HP48000019

In most previous theoretical studies on chemical reactions within impact-induced vapor plumes, only volatile components are considered. Chemical reactions between silicates and volatile components have been neglected. In particular, silica (SiO2) is important because it is the dominant component of silicates. Reactions between silica and carbon under static and carbon-rich " metallurgic" conditions (C/SiO2 >> 1) are known to occur to produce CO and SiC. Actual impact vapor plumes, however, cool dynamically and have carbon-poor " meteoritic" composition (C/SiO2 >> 1). Reactions under such conditions have not been investigated, and final products in such reaction systems are not known well. Although CO and SiO are thermodynamically stable at high temperatures under carbon-poor conditions, C and SiO2 are stable at low temperatures. Thus, CO may not be able to survive the rapidly cooling process of vapor plumes. In this study, we conduct laser pulse vaporization (LPV) experiments and thermodynamic calculations to examine whether interactions between carbon and silica occur in rapidly cooling vapor plumes with meteoritic chemical compositions. The experimental results indicate that even in rapidly cooling vapor plumes with meteoritic compounds are rather efficiently oxidized by silica-derived oxygen and that substantial amounts of both CO2 and CO are produced. The calculation results also suggest that those oxidation reactions seen in LPV experiments might occur in planetary-scale vapor plumes regardless of impact velocity as long as silicates vaporize.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1343-8832	1880-5981		WOS:000324049700013

Consequently, terrestrial photosynthetic organisms need mechanisms to protect against potential oxidative damage. The liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, a basal land plant, has habitats where it is exposed to both water and the atmosphere. Furthermore, like cyanobacteria, M. polymorpha has genes encoding flavodiiron proteins (FLV). In cyanobacteria, FLVs mediate oxygen-dependent alternative electron flow (AEF) to suppress the production of reactive oxygen species. Here, we investigated whether FLVs are required for the protection of photosynthesis in M. polymorpha. A mutant deficient in the FLV1 isozyme (Delta MpFlv1) sustained photooxidative damage to photosystem I (PSI) following repetitive short-saturation pulses of light. Compared with the wild type (Takaragaike-1), Delta MpFlv1 showed the same photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate but a lower electron transport rate during the induction phase of photosynthesis. Additionally, the reaction center chlorophyll in PSI, P700, was highly reduced in DMpFlv1 but not in Takaragaike-1. These results indicate that the gene product of MpFlv1 drives AEF to oxidize PSI, as in cyanobacteria. Furthermore, FLV-mediated AEF supports the production of a proton motive force to possibly induce the nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence and suppress electron transport in the cytochrome b(6)/f complex. After submerging the thalli, a decrease in photosystem II operating efficiency was observed, particularly in Delta MpFlv1, which implies that species living in these sorts of habitats require FLV-mediated AEF.									65	0	0	0	62	0	65			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000400366900011	28153920

Changes in the rate of charge separation at Photosystem I (PS I) and Photosystem II (PS II) were estimated by the parameters PHI(ps I) and PHI(ps II). PHI(ps I) is calculated on the basis of the proportion of centres in the correct redox state for charge separation to occur, as measured spectrophotometrically. PHI(ps II) is calculated using chlorophyll fluorescence to estimate the proportion of centres in the correct redox state, and also to estimate limitations in excitation delivery to reaction centres. With both increasing light intensity and decreasing temperature it was found that 02 evolution decreased more than predicted by either PHI(ps I) or PHI(ps II). The results are interpreted as evidence of non-assimilatory electron flow; either linear whole chain, or cyclic around each photosystem.									19	0	0	0	18	0	19			0166-8595			WOS:A1992JD30800003	24408359

These NiFeS@NF nanosheets require a low overpotential of only 243 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), superior to that of NiCoS@NF and FeCoS@NF synthesized under the same conditions. The mechanism by which the OER kinetics are enhanced is investigated in detail, where the unique 2D nanosheet architectures and Fe incorporation play a significant role. This hassle-free approach reported here contributes to an inexpensive and convenient access to the fabrication of effective nanocatalysts that can preclude harsh synthetic conditions such as high temperature and high pressure.

Searching for electrocatalysts with superior OER catalytic performance is of great importance. In this work, we reported a Ni foam (NF) supported CoFeV layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheet arrays as an efficient OER catalyst, which can afford a low overpotential for 0.242 and 0.33 V to generate 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. This activity is not only better than that of CoFe LDH/NF and CoV LDH/NF but also superior to that of the most reported OER catalysts. Its satisfactory activity is benefited from the introduction of a high valence state V, which could draw the electron and thus stabilize the neighboring 3d metals as the active sites. This work significantly indicates that CoFeV LDH/NF is a promising alternative as an electrocatalyst for water oxidation.									36	1	0	0	1	0	36			2168-0485			WOS:000489986400109

The experimental results indicate that the oxygen evolution activity of AgO crystal exhibits very obvious facet-dependent properties. Ago crystals with mainly {(1) over bar 11} exposed faces yield a superior catalytic activity over those with mainly {(2) over bar 02} exposed faces under electrochemical water oxidation conditions, which agrees with the theoretical calculations. The AgO film with dominant {(1) over bar 11} facets has a modest overpotential of 418 mV and its catalytic performance is demonstrated by long-term electrolysis at 2.03 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode in a near-neutral potassium phosphate solution. A stable current density of 3.7 mA cm(-2) persists for at least 6 h, and a Faradaic efficiency of 93% is obtained, which is much better than other Ag-based electrodes, especially current densities.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000466988600028

The single crystal X-ray diffraction results indicated that the immediate geometry around Cu(I) in the complexes is distorted tetrahedral, which is satisfied by the two sulfur centers of the xanthate ligands and two phosphorus centers of the two PPh3 moieties. Additionally, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under an inert atmosphere was performed, and the results indicated that the complexes decompose to copper sulfide. The complexes were decomposed under an inert atmosphere to obtain copper sulfides, which were characterized by PXRD and SEM. Additionally, their electrocatalytic properties were investigated in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The OER results indicate that the copper sulfide (CuxS-3) obtained from 3 exhibited the best activity with an onset potential of 475 mV.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000451074200028		
J	Kucharik, M.; Chamelot, P.; Cassayre, L.; Taxil, P.								Silver as anode in cryolite-alumina-based melts								CHEMICAL PAPERS				61	2			142	145		10.2478/s11696-007-0011-x				APR 2007	2007	The anodic behaviour of silver was investigated in cryolite-alumina-based melt. Silver has a lower melting point (ca. 960 degrees C) than the other metals considered as possible inert materials for aluminium electrolysis. The working temperature used in aluminium industry is approximately 960 degrees C, depending on the melt composition. Therefore, the stability of silver during the anodic process was tested at 870 degrees C in an acidic electrolyte consisting of 65.5 mass % Na3AlF6 + 22.9 mass % AlF3 + 5.7 mass % CaF2 + 3.9 mass % LiF + 2 mass % Al2O3 with the melting point ca. 850 degrees C. The electrolyte without alumina was prepared as well, with the melting point ca. 860 degrees C. The resulting cryolite ratio (CR = n(NaF)/n(AlF3)) for both electrolytes was equal to 1.6. The behaviour of the silver anode was studied by voltammetry measurements. The electrochemical study showed that an oxidation reaction occurred at a potential below the oxygen evolution potential. Silver was not found to be stable under oxygen evolution. The degradation of the silver anode was apparent after electrolysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2585-7290	1336-9075		WOS:000245818300011

Herein, in situ growth of Molybdenum-doped amorphous cobalt acid nickel nanoneedles on Ni foam (Mo-NiCo2O4/NF) has been successfully synthesized by a simple hydrothermal-annealing strategy. Benefiting from the unique hierarchical nanostructures and doping optimized electronic structural configuration, the cross-link network structure of Mo-doped amorphous NiCo2O4 with large specific surface areas exhibit excellent supercapacitor performance and electrocatalytic activity. As expected, the optimized Mo-doped NiCo2O4 samples possess a specific capacitance of 3970 mF cm(-2) at 1 mA cm(-2) and remarkable rate performance. The assembled hybrid supercapacitor obtains a maximum energy density of 35 Wh kg(-1) (420 W kg(-1)) and keeps a capacitance retention of 107% after 5000 cycles. As an electrocatalyst, Mo-NiCo2O4/NF shows a rapid self-reconstruction process during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that produces rich oxygen vacancies and thus exhibits remark-able long-term stability. The nanocomposites exhibit small overpotential (280 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope (43 mV dec(-1)). These results strongly demonstrate that both local amorphous phase and porous hierarchical structure design from Mo dopant provide superiorities for the synthesis of efficient and stable multifunctional electrode materials for energy storage and conversion.

The bimolecular reaction was initiated in a van der Waals dimer precursor, C2H4. NO2, and the evolution of the vinery radical product monitored by laser-induced fluorescence. The NO2 constituent of the complex was photodissociated at 266 nm. The triplet oxygen atom then attacks a carbon atom of C2H4 to form a triplet diradical (CH2CH2O) which subsequently dissociates to vinery (CH2CHO) and H. The rise time of vinery radical production was measured to be 217 (+ 75 - 25) ps. RRKM theory was applied and a late high exit barrier was invoked in order to fit the measured rise time. The structure and binding energy of the van der Waals complex have been modeled using Lennard-Jones type potentials and the results were compared with Other systems. The unimolecular side of the potential energy surfaces of this reaction has been investigated by photodissociating acetaldehyde at the same pump energy of 266 nm. The resulting photoproducts, acetyl radical (CH3CO) and formyl radical (HCO), have been monitored by resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) combined with a time-of-flight mass :spectrometer.:The similarity in the measured evolution times of both radicals indicates the same photodissociation pathway of the parent molecule. The photodissociation rate of acetaldehyde is estimated from RRKM theory to be very fast (3x10(12) s(-1)). The; T-1<--S-1 intersystem crossing (ISC) rate is found to be the rate determining step to photodissociation and increases with energy. The REMPI mechanism for the production of CH3CO+ is proposed to be the same as that of HCO+(2 + 1). The HCO product from the photodissociation of formaldehyde at 266 nm reveals a faster T-1<--S-1 ISC rate than in acetaldehyde.

The compound crystallizes in a monoclinic symmetry with a layered structure. UV-visible spectroscopy shows an optical transition of 2.58 eV. The thermal variation of the electrical conductivity indicates a semiconducting behavior with a conduction mechanism dominated by small polaron hopping: sigma=sigma(0) exp {0.44 eV/kT} and electron mobility (mu(300) (K)=0.3 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) thermally activated. The interfacial capacitance at pH similar to 7 is characteristic of n type behavior with a flat band potential of +0.40 V-SCE, an electrons density of 2 x 10(15) cm(-3) and a space charge region of 10 pm. The semicircle at high frequencies in the Nyquist plot is not centered on the real axis and the depletion angle (17 degrees) is due to a constant phase element. The impedance data at low frequencies indicate a diffusion-controlled process. As application, the photochemical oxygen evolution is successfully achieved under visible light with a liberation rate of 0.70 cm(3) min(-1) g(-1) and a quantum yield of 0.13%. The reaction (2 SO32-+H2O -> S2O32-+O-2+2OH, Delta G(0) = 90.68 kcal mol(-1)) can be evaluated for the chemical storage. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite recent progress, controllable synthesis of carbon functional materials is still a great challenge. We report a novel strategy to prepare simultaneously Fe-N-C catalysts and Fe3O4/N-doped carbon hybrids based on the sol-gel chemistry of gelatin and iron with controllability of structure and component. The catalysts demonstrate higher catalytic activity and better durability for oxygen reduction than precious Pt/C catalysts. The active sites of FeN4/C (D1) and N-FeN2+2/C (D3) are identified by Mossbauer spectroscopy, and most of the Fe ions are converted into D1 or D3 species. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity correlates well with the surface area, porosity, and the content of active Fe-N-x/C (D1 + D3) species. As an anode material for lithium storage, Fe3O4/carbon hybrids exhibit superior rate capability and excellent cycling performance. The synthetic approach and the proposed mechanism open new avenues for the development of sustainable carbon-based functional materials.									133	7	0	0	10	0	133			2375-2548			WOS:000216590300011	26601126

The oxygen evolution reactions are regarded as the most difficult procedure, because they are multiplestep reactions with multiple charges transfer. Notwithstanding the extensive study on photoelectrochemical and photochemical water oxidation, understanding how the surface charge reacts with the chemical molecules is limited, especially the reaction kinetics of the surface charges. We prepared anatase TiO2 nanotubes array and dense polycrystalline TiO2 films on Ti substrates, where the photocurrent increased about 4-4.5 times on nanotubes compared with the dense films. Moreover, the surface charge reaction rate and the accumulated charge densities were analyzed by transient surface photovoltage and transient photocurrent techniques. It was found a 2nd-order charge reaction behavior could be found when the charge density was high, differently, a 1st-order charge reaction could be observed when the charge density was low. The nanotubes structures would in situ grow from the Ti substrates, which simultaneously enhanced charge separation and transfer kinetics to improve the PEC performance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000865754800006

The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of Co-BPNC-PPh3 by using acetic acid (AcOH), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and p-toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH) as proton sources in N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent had been investigated. The turnover frequency (TOF) value of Co-BPNC-PPh3 was observed 450 h(-1) at an overpotential of 838 mV in neutral aqueous solution, showing excellent electrocatalytic HER activity. This Co-BPNC-PPh3 exhibited excellent durability and stability in the 5-hours electrolysis. Its activity is also better than cobalt 5, 10, 15-(tris-pentatfulorophenyl) corrole (Co-TPFC-PPh3), which may be ascribed to the-N=PPh3 proton relay effect in the electrocatalytic HER.

The C atoms next to the N dopant have been identified as the exact active sites, and optimizing the electronic structure of N has a great effect on the activity. In this study, a novel VN@NC nanocomposite consisting of a vanadium nitride (VN) nanoparticle core and chainmail-like NC shell has been constructed via a simple physical mixing and annealing process. Benefiting from the unique core@shell nanowire structure and modulated electronic structure, the as-prepared VN@NC manifests an obviously promoted ORR activity (onset potential: 0.93 V) compared with pure NC and bulk VN. Specifically, incorporating VN induces charge transfer from N on NC to V in VN and increases the electrophilicity of N on NC, resulting in optimized adsorption to O-containing intermediates. VN@NC also manifests decent long-term stability (89% current density retention after a 40,000-s test). This finding highlights the significance of regulating the electronic structure of N in NC and provides a reliable strategy for constructing NC-based hybrid electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000837948700001

Here, two cobalt(III) complexes [Co(ftsm)NH3(o-phen)]center dot H2O (1) {ftsm = bis(5-furan-1,2,4-triazole)-3-sulfinamide} and [Co(ptsm)NH3(o-phen)]center dot CH3OH (2) {ptsm = bis(5-phenyl-1,2,4-triazole)-3-sulfinamide} were synthesized and characterized by various spectroscopic and X-ray crystallography techniques. Complexes 1 and 2 were found to have admirable electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The Tafel slope values for GC/Nf-Complex-2 and GC/RuO2 were 53 and 60 mV/dec, respectively. Consequently, complex 2 possesses a better water oxidation response than standard material RuO2. The ligands Haftt, Haptt, o-phen, and complexes 1 and 2 were also tested for their cytotoxicity against Dalton's lymphoma (DL) cells employing MTT assay and found to have significant cytotoxicity. The IC50 values of Haftt, Haptt, mixed ligands Haftt + o-phen and Haptt + o-phen, and complexes 1 and 2 against DL cells were found to be 150, 400, 200, 450, 80, and 5 mu M, respectively. The complexes were found to have minimal effect on normal cells. The remarkable IC50 value for complex 2 shows that it can be utilized as a potential anticancer agent against DL cells.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0268-2605	1099-0739		WOS:000710983200001

Here we begin to explore how this gain in Faradaic efficiency is imparted through hydroxyl radical trap and Tafel experiments. It was found that increasing the FeOOH deposition time of the WO3 vertical bar FeOOH caused a decrease in the quantity of hydroxyl radical trapped during photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation. These results, along with the disparate Tafel slopes of bare WO3 and WO3 vertical bar FeOOH, suggest a change in the water oxidation mechanism between the two materials.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000563746200012

While the very limited sample of these first data may be consistent with no variations, they do offer a hint of anticorrelated variations between D/H and O/H. If confirmed by more data ( which will require independently determined, accurate H I column densities), these hints suggest that observations of interstellar gas within a few kiloparsecs of the solar neighborhood will reveal clear signs of the evolution of the abundance of deuterium from there and then (the big bang) to here and now ( the local interstellar medium of the Galaxy).									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0004-637X			WOS:000181713500027

Herein, we have fabricated Fe, Co dual single atoms dispersed on nitrogen-doped graphene ((Fe-x, Co-y)-NG) by freeze-drying method, which can as a highly efficient co-catalyst. The (Fe-x, Co-y)-NG loaded mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (mpg-C3N4) exhibits an excellently high performance for photo catalytic hydrogen evolution. The high activity can belong to two ways: (i) the ultrathin mpg-C3N4 not only increases the absorption and active sites but also shortens the charge migration distance; (ii) The nitrogen functional groups from NG can provide abundant coordination sites to evenly bind Fe and Co atoms. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performances (Fe-x, Co-y)-NG co-catalyst with different content ratios of Fe atoms and Co atoms were also investigated. The optimized hydrogen production rate (1958 mu mol g(-1)) of 5 wt% (Fe-0.2, Co-0.8)-NG/mpg-C3N4 is obviously higher compared to the monometallic counterparts (5 wt% Fe-NG/mpg-C3N4 or 5 wt% Co-NG/mpg-C3N4). The higher photoactivities are due to the synergistic effect between Fe and Co. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0925-8388	1873-4669		WOS:000720135800004

Natural Science Edition				38	4			42	47	1671-4628(2011)38:4<42:KCSZLJ>2.0.TX;2-2					2011	2011	The structural evolution of furfuryl alcohol resin at elevated temperatures has a.great influence.,on its structure and performance stability.Density functional theory calculations have been employed to investigate the thermal degradation reactions of furfuryl alcohol resin by studying different constituent units composed of one,two,and three furan rings.The results showed that the C-H bond was cleaved initially,producing hydrogen radicals at the methane or methyne bridges between the furan rings.The migration of the hydrogen radical to.the carbon atom of the furan ring and the ring-opening reaction occurred simultaneously.Depending on the distance between the hydrogen atom on the methane or methyne bridge and the oxygen atom on the furan ring,two possible pathways were found for the migration of the hydrogen radical and the ring-opening reaction':(i)In the case of the hydrogen atom being adjacent to the oxygen atom,the hydrogen radical initially becomes bonded to the oxygen atom,.resulting in the formation of a hydroxyl group.Finally,a chain ketone structure is obtained after the re-migration of the hydrogen radical to the carbon atom on the furan ring.Two transition states and- one.intermediate occur during such:,a ring-opening process.The activation energy of this pathway is lower than that of the other pathway.(ii)If the hy'drogen radical is far from the oxygen atom,the hydrogen radical migrates to the adjacent carbon directly.Only one transition state is observed.,In addition ,optimization of the; structures of every transition state and intermediate product was carried out using the B3LYP method,.and the corresponding single point energies were subsequently calculated at the MP2/6-31G℃ level.The results showed that the participation of H20 decreases the activation energy of the ring-opening reaction.In addition,the activation energies of the ring-opening reactions increase as the number of furan rings in the constituent units increases.			糠醇树脂在高温炭化过程中的结构演变,对其在高温下的结构／性能稳定性具有极为重要的影响。本文基于密度泛函理论方法,利用Gaussian09程序包,通过QST2(Quadratic Synchronous Transit)和IRC(Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate)等方法,研究了糠醇树脂在单呋喃环,双呋喃环,以及三呋喃环等不同层次结构单元的开环裂解反应路径。此外,在B3LYP/6-31G**水平下对开环过程中的各种结构进行优化,并在MP2/6-31G**水平下计算各结构的单点能,进而比较了各种反应路径的活化能。结果表明:位于呋喃环间的亚(次)甲基桥上的氢原子较为活泼,易形成氢自由基。伴随着氢自由基向呋喃环上的碳原子的迁移,呋喃环开环。而氢自由基的迁移主要表现出两种方式:(1)如产生的氢自由基与呋喃环上的氧原子较近,则先与氧原子相结合形成羟基,并导致呋喃环的开环;然后再从氧原子上迁移到碳原子上,从而形成链式的酮结构,此方式要经过两个过渡态和一个中间体才能完成开环。以这种方式开环需要的活化能相对较小。(2)当氢自由基与呋喃环上的氧原子较远,则直接迁移到碳原子形成 C-H键。该过程只经过一个过渡态即完成呋喃环的开环。此外,通过能量比较发现:有水参与的开环反应活化能,要低于无水参与的开环反应活化能;而随着呋喃环的增多,开环反应的活化能逐渐增大。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1671-4628			CSCD:4280871

Here, we reported that the oxidation of 3-methylpyridine (3-MP) into 3-PA as an alternative to the oxygen evolution on WO3 photoanode for improving the hydrogen-evolution efficiency and the product added-value of PEC cell. In a WO3 film photoanode-based dual-chamber PEC cell, 3-PA and hydrogen were simultaneously synthetized. Since the oxidation of 3-MP into 3-PA is more thermodynamically and kinetically favorable than water oxidation, higher efficiency of hydrogen evolution was achieved in the PEC cell with function of 3-PA synthesis relative to the conventional PEC cell for water splitting. Our investigations indicated that the oxidation of 3-MP into 3-PA on WO3 photoanode is co-initiated by the photogenerated holes and the H2O2 intermediate that originated from two-holes pathway of solar water oxidation on WO3. Additionally, the Cr2O72-/Cr3+ redox pair could mediate and promote the oxidation of 3-MP into 3-PA on WO3 photoanode, and thus the PEC efficiency of 3-PA synthesis can be improved by adding Cr3+ into the H2SO4-3-MP electrolyte.

In the present study, prolonged potential cycling was conducted on three N-doped carbons in O-2-saturated 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution, where apparent attenuation of the ORR activity was observed, within the context of limiting current and onset potential. The attenuation trend of the limiting current was closely correlated with the diminishing content of graphitic N, as manifested in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements and Mott-Schottky analysis. In addition, the specific activity per graphitic N was found to be almost invariant within a wide range of potentials during prolonged potential cycling for all three model catalysts, in good agreement with theoretical prediction, whereas no such a correlation was observed with pyrrolic or pyridinic N. Density functional theory calculations showed that the first-electron reduction, which is a rate-determining step for the 4e(-) ORR process, atoms adjacent to graphitic N, exhibited a much smaller Gibbs free-energy change than that on carbons neighboring pyrrolic or pyridinic N. These results strongly suggest that graphitic N is responsible for the ORR activity of N-doped carbons in alkaline electrolytes. Results in the present work may offer a generic, effective paradigm in the determination of catalytic active sites in heteroatom-doped carbons and be exploited as a fundamental framework for the rational design and engineering of effective carbon catalysts.									132	5	0	0	4	0	133			2155-5435			WOS:000441112400008

The Co3O4@N/C nanocomposite combines the advantages of N-doped carbon nanomaterials (high nitrogen content, good conductivity and high stability) and Co3O4 nanoparticles (high electrocatalytic activity), thus showing excellent catalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The Co3O4@N/C presents an almost same onset potential and half wave potential with Pt/C, but more positive than those for the N-undoped counterpart. The electron transfer number of 3.73 for Co3O4@N/C is closer to 4, but bigger than that for the N-undoped product (3.53), indicating that the Co3O4@N/C catalyst gives rise to a nearly 4e mechanism. The Co3O4@N/C shows better methanol tolerance and long-term durability than the N-undoped product and Pt/C catalyst. The excellent ORR performance originates from the synergistic interaction between Co3O4 and N-doped carbon in core-shell structure. This study might give a good method for the synthesis of MOF-derived carbon nanocomposite for ORR electrocatalyst.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000456759900055

Model thin film electrode studies show oxygen surface exchange rates that generally improve with increasing Fe content when x < 0.5, and are comparable to the best Co-containing perovskite electrode materials. Recent results on porous electrodes with the specific composition Sr(Ti0.3Fe0.7)O3-delta show excellent electrode performance and stability, but other compositions have not been tested. Here we report results for porous electrodes with a range of compositions from x = 0.5 to 0.9. The polarization resistance decreases with increasing Fe content up to x = 0.7, but increases for further increases in x. This results from the interaction of two effects - the oxygen solid state diffusion coefficient increases with increasing x, but the electrode surface area and surface oxygen exchange rate decrease due to increased sinterability and Sr surface segregation for the Fe-rich compositions. Symmetric cells showed no degradation during 1000 h life tests at 700 degrees C even at a current density of 1.5 A cm(-2), showing that all the STF electrode compositions worked stably in both fuel cell mode and electrolysis modes. The excellent stability may be explained by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) results showing that the amount of surface segregated Sr did not change during the long-term testing, and by relatively low polarization resistances that help avoid electrode delamination.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000489345300039

In this work, in-situ addition of cobalt/molybdenum ions to the electrolytic manganese dioxide has been shown to be beneficial for the OER in acid solution as its overpotential performed better (305 mV) than that of the commercial DSA (R) (341 mV) at 100 mA cm(-2). The OER was investigated at ambient temperature in 2 M H2SO4 solution on the modified EMD (MnMoCoO) electrodes. The energy efficiency of the MnMoCoO electrodes improved significantly with the amount of Co in the plating solution. For the electrodeposited catalysts, physico-chemical and electrochemical measurements were conducted including static overpotentials. The better performance of the modified EMD was attributed to an improved charge transfer resistance (R-ct; 0.290 Omega cm(2)), average roughness factor (r(f); 429) and decrease in water content in the electrodeposited catalysts. The kinetic parameters obtained on MnMoCoO catalysts were compared and discussed according to the cobalt concentration.									14	1	0	0	1	0	14			2045-2322			WOS:000362803600002	26469204

However, the methods of preparing NPMs are relatively complicated and have many limitations, which have hindered the commercial application of NPMs thus far. By introducing metal-induced crystallization, a solid-phase reaction method for preparing NPMs was developed in this study, which is highly efficient and environmentally friendly. The microstructure of the prepared nanoporous gold (NPG) was characterized on an atomic scale by scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The results confirmed that the solid-phase reaction method is an effective alternative means of preparing highly pure NPG. The results of electrochemical tests demonstrated that thus-prepared NPG possesses higher electrocatalytic activity than other types of gold electrodes toward oxygen reduction in alkaline media. The combination of a simple preparation process and higher activity suggests that the developed method may promote the future use of NPG in new energy applications, such as fuel cells and metal-air batteries.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000472947400001	31151117

The synthesis is performed by reduction of platinum 2,4-pentantedionate in the presence of oleylamine and oleic acid in dibenzyl ether at 200 degrees C. The growth process was monitored by time-course transmission electron microscopy (TEM), revealing a peculiar progressive evolution that, in comparison with previous methodologies, is quite unusual. In fact, the morphology evolves first through nanocubes, nanostars, and dendrites to arrive at porous multifaceted NPs. This offers the possibility to selectively obtain materials with different degrees of complexity at a different time of reaction with one synthetic approach. Moreover, fine tuning of the reaction conditions was achieved by assessing, in dedicated experiments, the effects of temperature, surfactant concentration, and surfactant ratio, allowing control on NPs' dispersity and shape reproducibility. The dimensionally monodispersed NPs have a mean diameter of 52 +/- 2 nm and display small regular crystallites with uniform facets exposed on the surface as evinced by high-resolution-TEM analysis.

In this study, a sulfur defective and manganese-doped nickel sulfide nanosheet that uniformly grown on nickel foam substrate (Mn-Ni3S2-x @NF) is synthesized. In alkaline solution, the Mn-Ni3S2-x @NF showed a low overpotential of 76 and 110 mV for OER and HER at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, together exhibiting excellent stability for both OER and HER reaction. It was confirmed by the experimental results that sulfur defects and Mn-doping synergistically optimized the electronic structure of Mn-Ni3S2-x with increased electrical conductivity and enhanced OER/HER activity. Moreover, amorphous nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) was observed by in situ Raman during the OER condition, suggesting NiOOH is the active phase for OER reaction. Furthermore, the electrolyzer assembled by Mn-Ni3S2-x @NF merely needs 1.46 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) and shows good stability as well.

Herein, we report a facile synthesis of novel hierarchical MoP/NiFeP hybrid hollow spheres (MoP/NiFeP HSs) as an electrocatalyst for the first time. The obtained MoP/NiFeP HSs enable not only abundant accessible sites, but also facilitated electron transfer through the heterointerfaces and synergistically promoted kinetics. The optimal MoP/NiFeP HSs present efficient bifunctional electrocatalytic performance with low overpotentials of 73 and 256 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER and OER in 1 M KOH, respectively. More importantly, when employed as electrocatalysts in a two-electrode device, low cell voltage of 1.51 V at 10 mA cm(-2) with long term durability can be achieved, comparable to the Ir/C-Pt/C couple and exceeding those of the recently reported typical bifunctional electrocatalysts. This work might inspire the design and preparation of highly active and low-cost hybrid materials with hierarchical structures for water splitting applications.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14				2052-1537		WOS:000604916500023

Among metal-air batteries, Zn-air batteries (ZABs) have garnered renewed interest as one of the most viable future options to power energy grids and electric vehicles. However, the slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics represent a limiting factor for the energy conversion efficiency of state-of-the-art ZABs. The focus of this review is the latest advances related to the development of non-precious metal catalysts. Four groups of bifunctional catalysts used in primary/secondary ZABs are reviewed. These include transition metal oxides (single/mixed-metal oxides, spinels and perovskites), transition metals, carbon-based materials and precious metals/alloys. ZAB electrochemistry and challenges originating from individual components of the system, such as the Zn electrodes, electrolytes and separators, are also outlined. In addition, the design and architecture of the air-electrode are discussed for future development of ZABs.									118	5	0	0	2	0	120			2398-4902			WOS:000424001700003

However, one challenge for these materials is their insufficient long-term stability in the acid environment. Herein, we systematically investigate both catalytic activity toward ORR and stability under acid conditions using density functional theory (DFT). Various local atomic structures around the MNx site and different metal atoms (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Ru) are considered in this study to understand the relation between atomic structures, stability, and catalytic activity. The stability of the M-N-C catalyst is considered from the propensity of the metal atom center to dissolve from the carbon host structure. The calculations reveal that the considered MNx sites are thermodynamically unstable in acid ORR conditions. However, based on the calculated thermodynamic driving force toward the metal dissolution, the MN4 sites with Fe, Co, Ni, and Ru metal atoms embedded on the graphene plane and at the graphene edge are more stable in the acid ORR condition than the other considered MNx structures. Combining the stability and catalytic activity descriptor, we propose some acid-stable and active MNx structures toward ORR. This computational study provides helpful guidance for the rational modification of the carbon matrix hosting MNx moieties and the appropriate selection of a metal atom for optimizing the activity and stability toward the ORR reaction.									13	0	0	0	0	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000716773800027

In particular we have addressed the effect of pulsed operation mode of a plane dielectric barrier discharge. It was conjectured that the large difference in the time scales involved in the fast dissociation of oxygen molecules in plasma and their subsequent reactions to produce ozone and nitrogen oxides, makes the presence of a continuously repeated plasma production unnecessary and a waste of electrical power and thus efficiency. In order to test such suggestion we have performed a numerical study of the composition and the temporal evolution of the gas-phase of atmospheric pressure air non-equilibrium plasmas. Comparison with experimental findings in a dielectric barrier discharge with an electrode configuration symmetrical and almost ideally plane is briefly addressed too, using plasma diagnostics to extract the properties of the single micro-discharges and a sensor to measure the concentration of ozone produced by the plasma.					13th European Plasma Conference on High-Tech Plasma Processes (HTPP)13th European Plasma Conference on High-Tech Plasma Processes (HTPP)	JUN 22-27, 2014JUN 22-27, 2014	Mairie Toulouse; Univ Touluse III; Laplace; CNRS; AAE; INP ENSEEIHTMairie Toulouse; Univ Touluse III; Laplace; CNRS; AAE; INP ENSEEIHT	Toulouse, FRANCEToulouse, FRANCE	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1742-6588	1742-6596	*****************	WOS:000346661100040

Acetogens are sensitive to molecular oxygen, which means that bioproduction reactors must be maintained under strict anaerobic conditions. This requirement increases cost and does not eliminate the possibility of O-2 leakage. For MES, the risk is even greater since the system generates O-2 when water splitting is the anodic reaction. Here, we show that O-2 from the anode of a MES reactor diffuses into the cathode chamber where strict anaerobes reduce CO2. To overcome this drawback, a stepwise adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) strategy is used to develop the O-2 tolerance of the acetogen Sporomusa ovata. Two heavily-mutated S. ovata strains growing well autotrophically in the presence of 0.5 to 5% O-2 were obtained. The adapted strains were more performant in the MES system than the wild type converting electrical energy and CO2 into acetate 1.5 fold faster. This study shows that the O-2 tolerance of acetogens can be increased, which leads to improvement of the performance and robustness of energy-storage bioprocesses such as MES where O-2 is an inhibitor.

Besides the direct application of H2O2 in chemical processes more and more enzymatic syntheses based on hydrogen peroxide were developed. Different types of reactions can be addressed by using a hydrogen-peroxide driven biocatalysis (e.g. hydroxylations, epoxidations, sulfoxidations, halogenations, Baeyer-Villiger oxidations, decarboxylations). H2O2-driven reactions can often be used to substitute NAD(P)H dependent reactions. Therefore, laborious cofactor regeneration systems can be avoided by using H2O2-dependent enzymes. The tremendous increase in the number of publications dealing with this type of reactions clearly demonstrates the progress in this area in recent years. The described innovations range from new enzymes and types of reaction to novel reaction engineering approaches. This review aims to give the scope of possible advantageous applications of peroxyzymes and a critical discussion of their current limitations. The versatile reactions, the ecological advantageous and the great progress in the discovery and engineering of novel enzymes make a technical use feasible.									81	2	0	0	17	0	82			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000471798100002

In this work, a self-supporting transition metal phosphate was prepared, in which nickel-cobalt phosphate (NixCo1-x(PO3)(2)) nanoparticles wrapped in nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) were supported on partially phosphatized foamed nickel (P-NF). The particles of ZIF-67-derived Co-N co-doped carbon were fixed on NF by electroplating Ni. The following phosphating led to the NixCo1-x(PO3)(2) particles wrapped in NC loading on P-NF (NiCoPO@NC/P-NF-e). The NixCo1-x(PO3)(2) nanoparticles could effectively afford active sites and exhibited preeminent catalytic activity. Also, NC could improve the electrical conductivity of the sample, accelerate the transfer and transport of charge and prevent the corrosion of electrolyte to NixCo1-x(PO3)(2) particles. The NiCoPO@NC/P-NF-e catalyst exhibited outstanding catalytic performances for oxygen evolution reaction in 1 M KOH and wide-pH hydrogen evolution reaction. A voltage of 1.50 V was required to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for water splitting. Besides, the NiCoPO@NC/P-NF-e catalyst showed superior durability for electrolysis of water. The work completed in this study provides a potential methodology for preparing 3D self-supporting phosphate catalysts.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000709746700003

It has been found that hydrogen interacts strongly with vacancy-related defects, such as the vacancy-oxygen (VO) center. These interactions can be monitored through the formation of the vacancy-oxygen-hydrogen (VOH) center, and this trapping of hydrogen persists at temperatures in excess of 300 C. The diffusion length of hydrogen has been found to be on the order of 10 pm in low doped Si. The defect evolutions during the trapping of hydrogen can be accurately modeled by a set of coupled differential equations describing the most prominent reactions involved.					34th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference34th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference	JUN 07-12, 2009JUN 07-12, 2009	IEEE Electron Devices Soc; IEEE Photon SocIEEE Electron Devices Soc; IEEE Photon Soc	Philadelphia, PAPhiladelphia, PA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0160-8371		978-1-4244-2949-3	WOS:000280345900320

Herein we report the one-pot precise synthesis of ultrafine Au core-PtAu alloy shell nanowires (Au@PtxAu UFNWs). Among them, Au@Pt0.077Au UFNWs exhibit the best performance for formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which only require applied potentials of 0.29 V and -22.6 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. The corresponding formic acid electrolyzer realizes the electrochemical H-2 production at a voltage of only 0.51 V with 10 mA cm(-2) current density. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the Au-riched PtAu alloy structure can facilitates the direct oxidation pathway of FAOR and consequently elevates the FAOR activity of Au@Pt0.077Au UFNWs. This work provides meaningful insights into the electrochemical H-2 production from both the construction of advanced bifunctional electrocatalysts and the replacement of OER.

Bayesian optimization of dynamic Ce(III) electrooxidation								AICHE JOURNAL											10.1002/aic.17930		OCT 2022			2022	Cerium(III/IV) is a redox couple with promising applications in redox flow batteries and redox-mediated water electrolyzers, but due to its high oxidation potential, parasitic oxygen evolution can occur and decrease the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of the oxidation reaction. Dynamic potential dosing can help balance the transport limitations and the electrooxidation rates, allowing for control over the cerium(III) concentration near the electrode, enhancing FE. Due to the large number of possible pulsing operating conditions, Bayesian optimization (BO) was used to rapidly identify the optimal potential pulses. With an active pulse voltage of 2.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the maximum FE achieved was 0.91 (active pulse time = 5 ms, resting pulse time = 136 ms), underscoring the need for long inactive times for cerium(III) diffusion to the electrode. Furthermore, a multiobjective BO was performed to identify optimal trade-offs between FE and the partial current density to achieve improvements over constant current operation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0001-1541	1547-5905		WOS:000873714500001

First row transition metal complexes offer the most promising oxygen reduction reaction of this class. The attempts to increase the number of catalytic sites and surface area of catalysts lead to materials based on metal organic frameworks (MOFs). These highly organized inorganic materials show impressive catalysis when comparing other non-precious metal catalysts and platinum as well, especially in the case of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks derived materials. Currently, MOFs-based materials have very good opportunity to replace platinum and bring fuel cells technology to commercialization.									29	1	0	0	3	0	30			2451-9103			WOS:000442798800026

The as-made CoFe2O4 NOCs-graphene composite exhibits very high activity towards ORR, meanwhile, excellent durability and very good tolerance to methanol were observed, which verifies the importance of exposing active facets of non-precious metal-based catalysts and also demonstrates its high potentials of replacing precious Pt for practical applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2365-6549			WOS:000414375600039

Di- and tetranuclear hydroxocomplexes of Co(III) and Fe(III) served as the simplest prototypes of artificial catalysts for the reaction under study. The predicted intermediates of the consecutive one-electron oxidation of the reaction site accompanied by its deprotonation appear to be analogs of well-known chemical structures of the type of transition metal complexes with dioxygen ligands. It is found that during the process only one metal ion undergoes the redox transformations, changing its valence state from IV to II, while the second metal ion serves mainly to stabilize the intermediates resulting from the oxidized water molecule. Thus, it confirms the well-known hypothesis at least on the dinuclear nature of the ''oxygen evolving reaction centre''. Release of a dioxygen molecule most probably occurs after the third oxidation of the initial form of the reaction site. The calculated energies of intermediates participating in the catalytic cycle are in reasonable agreement with available experimental data.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			0304-5102			WOS:A1994NW34500007

The exfoliation process results in the formation of self-assembled spherule-like superstructures with abundant edge sites, which are able to catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) via a two-electron pathway, with a higher efficiency than the bulk Bismuth. We rationalize the enhanced ORR activity of the BiNS to: (i) the presence of 1 dimensional topological edge states, which provide strong conduction channels for electron hopping between the bismuth layers and (ii) the more active role of edge sites in facilitating O-2 adsorption and dissociation of O-O bonds compared to the basal plane. The present study provides a pathway for employing 2D topological insulators as a new class of electrocatalysts for clean energy applications.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6				2046-2069		WOS:000599464100037	35519672

Water electrolysis offers high production of hydrogen but due to slow reaction rates on many electrode surfaces, electrocatalysts are needed. However effective electrocatalysts, such as platinum and rhenium, may be impractical for economic operation. Therefore, research in this area has been focused on finding materials that can replace these expensive electrocatalysts. The electrocatalytic behaviour of stainless steel towards water dissociation is presented. The use of two widely available and comparatively inexpensive stainless steels i.e., 304 and 316L, in a variety of forms, i.e., mesh, solid electrode, and adsorbed nanoparticles is discussed. Results of microscopic characterization are compiled to illustrate how surface modification of these substrates affects their electrocatalytic ability. The crystallographic orientations i.e. (111) and (220) in the microstructure of stainless steel are believed to be effective in catalytic dissociation of H2O. The catalytic activity and long-term stability measurements of stainless steels have yielded results similar to or sometimes better than-those of the noble electrocatalysts. The review briefly captures the current progress in HER and OER electrocatalysis on stainless steels and highlights the possible research solutions to overcome existing challenges i.e., lack of active centers, the surface modification needed, poisoning of active species and an overall low stability, the solution to which could make stainless steel a viable replacement for the precious metals electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1364-0321	1879-0690		WOS:000793455600004

For comparison, pure Pb and Pb-Ag (0.8 wt%) anodes were also prepared as references by melt casting. The oxygen evolution and corrosion behaviors of the anodes were evaluated by performing measurements of galvanostatic polarizations, Tafel curves, anodic polarization curves, mass increments, and ion concentrations. The morphologies and phase compositions of the anode oxidation layers after polarization were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. The results showed that as the content of CeO2 increased, the stabilized potential of the composite anodes gradually decreased; the Pb-CeO2 (> 1.5 wt%) composite anode exhibited lower stabilized potential and higher electrocatalytic activity than the Pb-Ag anode during galvanostatic polarization. The Pb-CeO2 (> 0.5 wt%) composite anode showed better corrosion resistance than the pure Pb and Pb-Ag (0.8 wt%) anode. The increase in CeO2 content improves the compactness and thickness of the oxide layer formed on the anode surface, but excess CeO2 leads to high porosity of the anode, thus deteriorating the performance. The Pb-CeO2 (2.5 wt%) anode showed comprehensively improved electrochemical performance and corrosion resistance.									16	3	0	0	1	0	16			0304-386X	1879-1158		WOS:000458094100028

CoNCN exhibits higher initial turnover frequencies of (TOF/S-BET: 2.1 x 10(-1)) for visible-light-driven oxygen evolution than cobalt oxide catalysts (TOF/S-BET: 3.5 x 10(-3)) and a 18% higher oxygen yield (Ru-dye sensitized standard setup). Furthermore, CoNCN maintains stable current densities in electrolysis over 20 h, and structural tuning through cationic substitution revealed that mixed (Co, Ni) NCN catalysts with low Ni contents display higher current densities than pristine CoNCN. A wide range of bulk (XAFS/EXAFS, XRD, FTIR) and surface (XPS, EELS, HRTEM) analytical methods together with catalytic parameter variations and reference experiments were performed to confirm the stability of CoNCN under standard operational conditions. The carbodiimide matrix thus offers a straightforward structural alternative to oxide systems and a clear-cut starting point for optimization strategies and for mechanistic studies on the possible role of active carbon or nitrogen sites. This paves the way to metal carbodiimides as a novel catalyst design platform for heterogeneous energy conversion systems.									56	3	0	0	3	0	56			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000349997000041

The metal-silicate partitioning reaction promoted carbon capture during Earth's accretion and may have sequestered substantial carbon in Earth's core. The freezing reaction involving iron-carbon liquid could have contributed to the growth of Earth's inner core and the geodynamo. The redox melting/freezing reaction largely controls the movement of carbon in the modern mantle, and reactions between carbonates and silicates in the deep mantle also promote carbon mobility. The 10-year activity of the Deep Carbon Observatory has made important contributions to our knowledge of how these reactions are involved in the cycling of carbon throughout our planet, both past and present, and has helped to identify gaps in our understanding that motivate and give direction to future studies.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0003-004X	1945-3027		WOS:000505007500003

Structural optimization, composition regulation and carrier modification are the common strategies to improve the activity and stability of Pt-based catalyst. Strikingly, the morphological evolution of Pt-based electrocatalyst into nanoframes (NFs) have attracted wide attention to reduce the Pt consumption and improve the electrocatalytic activity simultaneously. Contrary to Pt-based solid nanocrystalline materials, Pt-based NFs have many advantages in higher atomic utilization, open space structure and larger specific surface area, which facilitate electron transfer, mass transport and weaken surface adsorption by more unsaturated coordination sites. Here we introduce the detailed preparation strategies of Pt-based NFs with different etching methods (oxidative etching, chemical etching, galvanic replacement and carbon monoxide etching), crystal structure evolution and formation mechanism, efficient applications for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) in direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs). Based on the high-efficiency atom utilization, open space structure and diverse alloy composition, Pt-based NFs exhibit superior activity, stability and anti-poisoning than commercial counterparts in the application of DAFCs. The current challenges and future development of Pt-based NFs are prospected on the type of NFs materials, synthesis and etching methods, crystal control and catalytic performance. We propose a series of improvement mechanisms of Pt-based NFs, such as small size effect, high-energy facets, Pt-skin construction and Pt-C integration, thereby weakening the molecule absorption, increasing the Pt utilization, strengthening the intrinsic stability, and alleviating the metal dissolution and support corrosion. Additionally, the scale-up synthesis of catalytic materials, membrane electrodes assembly, and development of the start-stop system and the circulation system design are essential for the commercial application of Pt-based NFs and industrial manufacturing of DAFCs. More importantly, the reaction mechanism, active site distribution and dynamic changes in the catalytic material during the catalytic reaction are crucial to further explain the maintenance and evolution of catalytic performance, which will open a window to elucidate the improvement mechanism of the catalyst in the fuel cell reactions. This review work would promote continuous upgradations and understandings on Pt-based NFs in the future development of DAFCs.									16	5	0	0	2	0	17			1000-6818			WOS:000614110200016

For chemical kinetics, the parameters were estimated using different kinetic models, namely the single-or parallel-reaction kinetic model with higher orders and the two-step consecutive reaction model. The two-step model could adequately explain the pyrolysis reaction of multiple reactions with different reaction orders i.e., first step is of the first order (m = 1) with respect to the mass of biomass, and the second step is of the second order (n = 2) with respect to the mass of the intermediate to char. The intrinsic kinetics at different heating rates in the absence of oxygen was derived through thermogravimetric analysis. The kinetics of the evolution of non-condensable gases was studied in a self-designed reactor, and an appropriate kinetic model of rice husk biomass pyrolysis that showed excellent agreement with experimental data was established.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			2194-5748	1542-6580		WOS:000424741800007

Herein, we report a highly active and stably heterostructural electrocatalyst consisting of NiCoP nanowires decorated with CoP nanoparticles on a nickel foam (NiCoP-CoP/NF) for effective hydrogen evolution. The CoP nanoparticles are strongly interfaced with NiCoP nanowires producing abundant electrocatalytically active sites. Combined with the integrated catalyst design, NiCoP-CoP/NF affords a remarkable hydrogen evolution performance in terms of high activity, enhanced kinetics, and outstanding durability in an alkaline electrolyte, superior to most of the Co (or NO-phosphide-based catalysts reported previously. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that there is an interfacial effect between NiCoP and CoP, which allows a preferable hydrogen adsorption and thus contributes to the significantly enhanced performance. Furthermore, an electrolyzer employing NiCoP-CoP/NF as the cathode and RuO2/NF as the anode (NiCoP-CoP/NF parallel to RuO2/NF) exhibits excellent water-splitting activity and outstanding durability, which is comparable to that of the benchmark Pt-C/NF parallel to RuO2/NF electrolyzer.									90	9	0	0	2	0	91			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000466988800036	30950262

Herein, we demonstrate an approach to realize the direct conversion of two-dimensional (2D) graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) into one-dimensional (1D) metal-ended nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (M-NCNTs). For Co-NCNTs, Co@CoOx nanoblocks were found at the end of the nanotubes. The Co@CoOx nanoparticles in Co-NCNTs can be chemically modulated by acid etching to endow them with catalytic activity towards the ORR and OER. After nitric acid (HNO3) etching, the Co-NCNTs-N shows superior activity both in the ORR with an onset potential of 0.86 V and a half-wave potential of 0.80 V and in the OER with a potential of 1.58 V at 10 mA cm(-2). Assembled in Zn-air batteries, the Co-NCNTs-N electrode also presents an ultrahigh power density of 210 mW cm(-2), a small charge-discharge voltage gap of 0.80 V and a good stability of 130 hours, outperforming the commercial Pt/C-RuO2 electrode.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2052-1553			WOS:000810163100001

In this study we demonstrate the potential of aqueous TMG alkaline electrolyte as a substitute for NaOH(aq)/KOH(aq) with greater chemical similarity to AAEM functional groups. The water redox activities of Pt and Pd electrodes in 0.1 M TMG and 0.1 M KOH are compared, while hydrogen evolution/oxidation reactions (HER/HOR) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are studied in depth. Aqueous TMG supports comparable redox activity to KOH of equal concentration, but modifies surface processes through potential-dependent adsorptive behaviors. Rotating electrode, capacitance, and slow polarization measurements suggest that TMG and its decomposition species delay and participate in HER. HOR on Pt resembles that of a perfectly flat (111) surface in KOH, while hydrogen absorption on Pd is significantly hindered. ORR activity is dependent upon overpotential on both electrodes. But unlike most acid and alkaline electrolytes, TMG appears to alter the reaction pathway on Pt toward a 1.5e route. We propose that native or modified analogues of TMG might be optimized for compatibility with various catalysts so as to be utilized in alkaline electrochemical devices in place of NaOH and KOH.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1932-7447			WOS:000343333600038

Similar experiments were conducted in SiC coatings, ZrB2 and ZrC ceramic sheets for comparison. The multiphase coating showed the better oxidation resistance at a higher oxygen partial pressure, and its mass change was 1.34% after isothermal oxidation for 6 h at an oxygen partial pressure of 80,000 Pa. With the increase of the oxygen partial pressure, ZrO2 particles with fibrous denticles were replaced by the aggregations of ZrO2 particles and more SiO2 glass was formed in a short time. The formed SiO2 glass could effectively heal the microcracks of oxide scale. Moreover, the ZrB2 and ZrC phases played an important role in deflecting cracks and restraining the propagation of cracks during oxidation. As the oxygen partial pressure increased, the oxide scale of SiC-ZrB2-ZrC coating became denser, presenting a two-layered structure composed of a SiO2 layer and a Si-O-Zr layer at the elevated oxygen partial pressure.

J	Labarbe, Rudi; Hotoiu, Lucian; Barbier, Julie; Favaudon, Vincent								A physicochemical model of reaction kinetics supports peroxyl radical recombination as the main determinant of the FLASH effect								RADIOTHERAPY AND ONCOLOGY				153		SI		303	310		10.1016/j.radonc.2020.06.001				DEC 2020	2020	Background and purpose: FLASH radiotherapy, a technique based on delivering large doses in a single fraction at the micro/millisecond timescale, spares normal tissues from late radiation-induced toxicity, in an oxygen-dependent process, whilst keeping full anti-tumor efficiency. We present a theoretical model taking into account the kinetics of formation and decay of reactive oxygen species, in particular of organic peroxyl radicals ROO center dot formed by addition of O-2 to primary carbon-centred radicals R-center dot and known to play a major role at the origin radio-induced complications.Materials and methods: The model focuses on the time-dependent evolution of radiolytic products in living matter exposed to continuous irradiation at dose-rates in the range 10(-3) - 10(7)Gy center dot s(-1). The 9 differential rate equations resulting from the radiolytic and enzymatic reactions network were solved using the published values of these reactions rate constants in a cellular environment.Results: The model suggests a correlation between the area-under-the-curve of time-evolving [ROO center dot] and the probability of normal tissue complications. The model does not lend weight to the hypothesis of transient oxygen depletion as a main determinant of FLASH but rather suggests a major role of radical-radical recombination.Conclusion: The model gives support to the reduction of ROO center dot lifetime as the main root of FLASH and compares favorably with published experimental results. We conclude that any process - in this case radical recombination - that shortens the lifetime or limits the radiolytic yield of ROO center dot is likely to protect normoxic tissues against the deleterious effects of radiation.

AOD slag carbonation has both the resource utilization of metallurgical waste slag and the carbon reduction effect of CO2 storage. This paper aimed to study carbonation reaction characteristics of AOD slag. Under the slurry-phase accelerated carbonation route, the effect of stirring speed (r) and reaction temperature (T) on AOD slag's carbonation was studied by controlling the reaction conditions. Mineral composition analysis and microscopic morphology analysis were used to explore the mineral phase evolution of AOD slag during the carbonation process. Based on the unreacted core model, the kinetic model of the carbonation reaction of AOD slag was analyzed. The results showed that the carbonation ratio of AOD slag reached its maximum value of 66.7% under the reaction conditions of a liquid to solid ratio (L/S) of 8:1, a CO2 partial pressure of 0.2 MPa, a stirring speed of 450 r.min(-1), and a reaction temperature of 80 degrees C. The carbonation reaction of AOD slag was controlled by internal diffusion, and the calculated apparent activation energy was 22.28 kJ/mol.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2227-9717		WOS:000827227800001

In this review, we have described the vectorial redox reactions at oil/water interfaces. The structure of liquid interfaces, donor-acceptor interactions in the electrical double layer, specific bounding between molecules plays the dominant role in interfacial catalysis. Theoretical aspects of charge transfer reactions at oil/water interfaces are discussed. The activation energy of electron transfer depends on the charges of the reactants and dielectric permittivity of the non-aqueous phase. Experimental interfacial catalytic systems are described. Amphiphilic molecules were studied as catalysts of electron transfer reactions at the oil/water interface. A concerted 2:1:l-electron mechanism for cytochrome oxidase functioning is evaluated by thermodynamic and kinetic analysis. The conditions are formulated for the occurrence of multielectron oxygen reduction. Kharkats and Volkov first presented proofs that cytochrome c oxidase reduces molecular oxygen by synchronous multielectron mechanism without O-2(-) intermediate formation [Yu.I. Kharkats, A.G. Volkov, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 891 (1987) 56]. As the field progresses after this pioneering observation, it became clear that the first step of dioxygen reduction is two-electron concerted process. As follows from thermodynamics energy for the Hf-pump functioning is liberated only at the last two steps of water formation on addition of third and fourth electrons independently of the reaction pathway.

The net observed phenomenon here is a hydroxyl migration. However, mechanistic studies using electronic structure theory reveal that the hydroxyl migration occurs by a synergistic pathway led by a proton hop and assisted by an interconversion between a bridging oxygen and a terminal oxygen. The proton hop provides access to two isomers, which differ in the relative position and orientation of the hydroxy groups, thereby generating the scope for an enhanced catalytic activity in important processes such as hydrogen evolution from water.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			1948-7185			WOS:000283463500013

This photocatalyst shows excellent stability and high efficiency in the complete mineralization of nonpolar gaseous molecules (CH4 and C2H4) under the simulated sunlight. The appreciable performance improvements are caused by the formation of heterojunctions and oxygen vacancy defects, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of noble metal nanoparticles as well as the 3D porous microsphere structures. Especially in this work, we systematically studied the effect of concentration changes of oxygen vacancy defects on photocatalytic performance by XPS, EPR and Raman characterization. Furthermore, a possible mechanism of photo-oxidation reaction in plasmonic photocatalyst system is discussed below.

Emphasis is given to the results obtained in the last decade, and focus is mainly on the experimental work performed concerning the influence of transfer channels on fusion cross sections and the hindrance phenomenon far below the barrier. Indeed, early data of sub-barrier fusion taught us that cross sections may strongly depend on the low-energy collective modes of the colliding nuclei, and, possibly, on couplings to transfer channels. The coupled-channels (CC) model has been quite successful in the interpretation of the experimental evidences. Fusion barrier distributions often yield the fingerprint of the relevant coupled channels. Recent results obtained by using radioactive beams are reported. At deep sub-barrier energies, the slope of the excitation function in a semi-logarithmic plot keeps increasing in many cases and standard CC calculations overpredict the cross sections. This was named a hindrance phenomenon, and its physical origin is still a matter of debate. Recent theoretical developments suggest that this effect, at least partially, may be a consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle. The hindrance may have far-reaching consequences in astrophysics where fusion of light systems determines stellar evolution during the carbon and oxygen burning stages, and yields important information for exotic reactions that take place in the inner crust of accreting neutron stars.									51	1	0	0	0	0	52			1434-6001	1434-601X		WOS:000408494800001

Herein, nickel porous networks codoped with Cu and Fe prepared by thermal reduction of presynthesized Cu, Fe-codoped Ni(OH)(2) nanowires are reported. The sample consists of nanoparticles of similar to 80 nm, which form highly porous network clusters of similar to 1 mu m with a pore size of 10-100 nm. Among the various doped compositions, the NiCu0.05Fe0.025 porous network exhibits the best catalytic activity with a low overpotential of 60 mV for a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1 M KOH solution and a specific activity of 0.1 mA cm(-2) at 117 mV overpotential calculated based on the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). The density functional theory calculations reveal that codoping of Fe and Cu into the Ni lattice results in a shift of d-bands of nickel to lower energy levels and thus in the reduced hydrogen adsorption energy (Delta G(H) = -0.131 eV), which is close to Delta G(H) for Pt (-0.09 eV). When NiCu0.05Fe0.025(OH)(2) nanowires is used as an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst and is coupled with NiCu0.05Fe0.025 porous networks for overall water splitting, the NiCu0.05Fe0.(025)parallel to NiCu0.05Fe0.025(OH)(2) catalyst couple achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.491 V, similar to that of the Pt/C parallel to RuO2 couple and offers a negligible loss in the performance when operated at 20 mA cm(-2) for 30 h.									20	2	0	0	0	0	20			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000508464500044	31845572

Co-UPDI as photocatalyst exhibits more an order of magnitude of POE rate than UPDI at pH = 4.8 (8.00 vs. 0.58 mmol h(-1)g(-1)), which is the highest among reported POE tests in aqueous colloid system with AgNO3 as sacrificial agent. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) reaches 4.39 % at 450 nm. The systematical experiments reveals that the heterojunction formation between UPDI line and Co(NO3)(2) molecules is crucial through the coordination of Co with N atoms. Consequently, the rigidity of UPDI line enhances, H-type stacking of PDI moiety becomes closer, and CoOOH as cocatalyst in-situ forms during POE.

Herein, a facile procedure is described for the preparation of effective bifunctional electrocatalysts for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), where ruthenium nanoparticles are supported on graphene nanosheets that are codoped with atomic cobalt and nitrogen by controlled pyrolysis of melamine-functionalized graphene oxide and metal ion precursors. The obtained nanocomposites (CoNG/Ru) exhibit a remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward both HER and OER in alkaline media, with a respective overpotential of only -15 and +350 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is much better than the monometallic counterparts and relevant catalysts in the literature. With CoNG/Ru as bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting in a two-electrode system, a low potential of 1.58 V is needed to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is even better than that with commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. This is ascribed to the synergistic interactions between the metal species by metal-metal charge transfer. These results highlight the significance of exploiting the electronic interactions between metal species in carbon-based nanocomposites to develop bifunctional catalysts for electrochemical energy technologies.									21	2	0	0	2	0	21			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000503918300054	31755691

The results showed that the nanostructured 3 mol% yttria stabilized zirconia coatings had lower resistance to low temperature ageing, although the nanostructured coatings have a metastable tetragonal-prime (t') crystal structure. The degradation mechanism was explained in terms of the diffusion of oxygen vacancies and OH- ion and the reactions between OH- and Y-Zr' ion. The microstructure of as-sprayed coating, especially the microcracks, plays a very important role in the low temperature degradation. It can enhance and accelerate the low temperature degradation. It was also verified by wavelength dispersive spectrometer (WDS) analysis that an yttrium-rich surface was formed due to the reaction between OH- and Y-Zr' ion, which resulted in the transformation of t' to monoclinic zirconia phase.

However, the mixing of H-2 and O-2 whether through traditional one-step or two-step photocatalytic overall water splitting requires additional steps for their separation, which limits its practical application. Herein, a tandem photocatalytic system consisting of an O-2-evolution photocatalyst panel and a H-2-evolution photocatalyst panel is established to address the above issue. The two photocatalyst panels are spatially isolated in an O-2-evolution compartment and a H-2-evolution compartment while being electrically linked with the aid of redox couples based on a Z-scheme design. Overall water splitting to produce H-2 and O-2 stoichiometrically was realized with a SrTiO3:Rh-based H-2 evolution photocatalyst panel and a BiVO4-based O-2 evolution photocatalyst panel as a demonstration. The two photocatalyst panels are aligned in a tandem manner, which allows more efficient utilization of solar irradiation. An apparent quantum efficiency of 0.2% at 420 nm for overall water splitting is obtained after optimization. More impressively, separated H-2 and O-2 evolution can be realized, demonstrating the advantages of the present Z-scheme system based on photocatalyst panels.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000732045400001

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting provides a promising technique for converting solar energy to sustainable hydrogen. Limited by the rate-determining oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the development of efficient photoanodes is crucial for overall PEC performance. Among the potential photoanode candidates, bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has recently raised widespread attention owing to the suitable bandgap, cost-effectiveness, and chemical stability. However, the insufficient light absorption, poor charge transport properties and sluggish surface reaction render the efficient PEC solar hydrogen production an unsolved and ongoing challenge. Therefore, considerable efforts have been devoted to meeting this challenge. In this review, recent advancements in BiVO4 photoanodes have been summarized. Subsequently, effective strategies for improving light absorption, charge separation and transport, surface reaction, and long-term stability are introduced. In addition, unassisted tandem devices for PEC water splitting are also discussed. This review provides a survey of relevant PEC water splitting systems from past to present and outlooks on the future scale-up based on BiVO4 photoanodes, with particular focus on the breakthroughs of photoanodes design and systems integration. ?? 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work we show that synthesised using standard galvanic replacement reaction (with Co templates) hollow platinum nanoparticles exhibit enhanced catalytic activity also towards reduction of 4-nitrophenol by sodium borohydride in water. Unlike in the case of procedures involving hollow platinum catalysts employed so far to carry out this reaction it is not necessary to couple analysed platinum nanoparticles to the surface of an electrode. Simplification of the analyzed reaction may eliminate same experimental errors. We found that the enhanced catalytic activity of hollow Pt nanoparticles is not only connected with generally observed larger surface area of hollow nanostructures, but is also due to the contamination of formed hollow nanostructures with cobalt, from which sacrificial templates used in the synthesis of hollow Pt nanostrustures have been formed. Because using sacrificial templates is a typical method of synthesis of hollow metal nanostructures, formed hollow nanoparticles are probably often contaminated, which may significantly influence their catalytic activity.

Redox zonation created by the influx of oxygenated waters has previously been simulated using reactive transport models that have incorporated a variety of processes, resulting in predictions for the depth of oxygen penetration that may vary greatly. An assessment and direct comparison of the various underlying conceptual models are therefore needed. In this work a reactive transport model that considers multiple processes in an integrated manner is used to investigate the ingress of oxygen for both single fracture and fracture zone scenarios. It is shown that the depth of dissolved oxygen migration is greatly influenced by the a priori assumptions that are made in the conceptual models. For example, the ability of oxygen to access and react with minerals in the rock matrix may be of paramount importance for single fracture conceptual models. For fracture zone systems, the abundance and reactivity of minerals within the fractures and thin matrix slabs between the fractures appear to provide key controls on O(2) attenuation. The findings point to the need for improved understanding of the coupling between the key transport-reaction feedbacks to determine which conceptual models are most suitable and to provide guidance for which parameters should be targeted in field and laboratory investigations.

However, in most catalytic systems, the function of oxygen is simply to participate in the reaction as a reactant. Herein, a metal-free catalyst (DEX-160, derived from the hydrothermal treatment of dextran at 160 degrees C) expanded the role of oxygen, showing high performance in H2O2 photoproduction with a yield of up to 2667 mu mol g(-1) h(-1). Carbon dots generated on the surface of DEX-160 promote the separation and transfer of photo-induced charges. The in situ transient photo-induced voltage and photoelectrochemistry tests show that O-2 served as both a reactant and an electron sink to enhance the H2O2 photoproduction in the photocatalytic process of DEX-160. This study provides new insight for understanding the role of oxygen and the carbon dot-assisted metal-free photocatalyst for H2O2 evolution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000820389200001

Herein, the oxygen stoichiometry control of LNMO was achieved through a microwave annealing treatment. The prepared non-stoichiometric LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4-delta (Fd (3) over barm) materials delivered a pronounced improvement of rate capability, e.g. the discharge capacity at an ultra-fast rate (10 C) is up to 104.3 mA h g(-1). Instead of the typical two-step phase transformation process, a solid-solution-like reaction in the as-synthesized LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4-delta (Fd (3) over barm) during cycling was deciphered by an in situ synchrotron radiation diffraction analysis. These findings shed light on the phase transition mechanism of defective spinel oxides with an enhanced electrochemical properties.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000569320400008

Mineral reconstruction in chlorination roasting and electrodeposition in deep eutectic solvent have been combined in this work. The electrodeposition of Ni-Mo-Cu coatings from roasted nickel matte precursor in choline chloride (ChCl)-urea deep eutectic solvent (DES) has been investigated. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) implies that the electrodeposition process of Ni-Mo-Cu coatings in ChCl-urea DES consists of a one-step reaction of Ni(II), a two-step reaction of Cu(II) and Ni/Mo inductive co-deposition. The hydrogen evolution performance parameters of deposited Ni-Mo-Cu coatings have been systematically studied in alkaline solution by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) has been tested by CV. The hydrogen evolution kinetics of deposited Ni-Mo-Cu coatings has been further investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Owing to its high electrochemical surface area, the Ni-Mo-Cu coating deposited on Ni foam at -1.2 V can deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 93 mV in 1 M KOH. It is suggested that Ni-Mo-Cu coating can be a promising candidate for water splitting in alkaline solution. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The conversion of phenol was carried out with these electrodes as anodes under galvanostatic control. Samples during the electrolyses were characterized with UV-vis spectra and chromatography, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) and instantaneous current efficiency (ICE) for phenol degradation were also determined. The results show that phenol can be oxidized and degraded for all of the three anodes, and the oxidation reactions of phenol follow first-order kinetics, but there are considerable differences in the effectiveness and performance of electro-catalytic degradation. Phenol can be degraded relatively fast on the Ti/SnO2 + Sb2O3/PbO2 anode and the degradation rate of phenol is slower with the Ti/SnO2 + Sb2O3/MnOx electrode, and the slowest with the Ti/SnO2 + Sb2O3/RuO2 + PbO2 electrode, whose apparent rate constants are 2.49 x 10(-2), 1.42 x 10(-2) and 9.76 x 10(-3) min(-1), respectively. The rates of electro-catalytic degradation relate to oxygen evolution potential, and the higher the oxygen evolution potential, the better the performance of electro-catalytic degradation. The potential for oxygen evolution at the Ti/SnO2 + Sb2O3/PbO2 anode is highest, then Ti/SnO2 +Sb2O3/MnOx, following Ti/SnO2 + Sb2O3/RuO2 + PbO2. The accelerated life tests at 60 degrees C and in 1.0 mol L-1 aqueous H2SO4 with an anodic current density of 4.0A cm(-2) show that the service life is prolonged when the SnO2 + Sb2O3 interlayer coating are inserted between Ti substrate and active layers.

These consistently low values can be explained by host-rock buffering in a very narrow emerald-bearing reaction zone between ultrabasic greenstones (metamorphosed komatiites) and albitised pegmatites. delta(18)O values of Sandawana emeralds overlap those of emeralds from Brazil, Austria, Australia and Madagascar, a fact indicating that, in these cases, oxygen isotope composition alone is not sufficient to determine the geographic origin of commercially available emeralds. However, stones with overlapping delta(18)O values may eventually be identified using a combination of physical properties, inclusion characteristics and chemical composition.

After corrections of noncompensated solution resistance from ac impedance spectroscopy and of hydrogen mass transport in the HOR branch, the kinetic current densities were fitted to the Butler-Volmer equation using a transfer coefficient of alpha = 0.5, from which HOR/HER exchange current densities on Pt(pc) and Pt/C were obtained, and the HOR/HER mechanisms in alkaline solution were discussed. Unlike the HOR/HER rates on Pt electrodes in alkaline solution, the HOR/HER rates on a Pt electrode in 0.1 M HClO(4) were limited entirely by hydrogen diffusion, which renders the quantification of the HOR/HER kinetics impossible by conventional RDE measurements. The simulation of the hydrogen anode performance based on the specific exchange current densities of the HOR/HER at 80 degrees C illustrates that in addition to the oxygen reduction reaction cell voltage loss on the cathode, the slow HOR kinetics are projected to cause significant anode potential losses in alkaline fuel cells for low platinum loadings (> 130 mV at 0.05 mg(Pt)/cm(anode)(2) and 1.5 A/cm(anode)(2)), contrary to what is reported for proton exchange membrane fuel cells.

Until now, there are many different nickel sulfides, such as Ni3S2, NiS, Ni3S4, NiS2, etc. In this paper, we set out to explore the influence of the S:Ni ratio in raw materials on the different nickel sulfides. With the characterizations of XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM and BET, the relevance between the molar ratio of S:Ni in raw materials and stoichiometric ratio, microscopic structure and OER performance are discussed. According to the results of the experiments, the Ni3S4 derived from the 3:1 M ratio of S:Ni in raw material exhibits the smallest overpotential (245 and 314 mV to achieve 10 and 20 mA/cm(2)) and Tafel slope (81.5 mV/dec). Meanwhile, theoretical calculation of Delta G(H2O*) indicate that the adsorption energy in Ni3S4 is much closer to the IrO2 than other nickel sulfides, which are in good agreement with the OER performance of electrochemical measurements.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000479082900066

This kind of discharge generates a non-thermal plasma at atmospheric pressure and quasi-ambient temperature. The resulting plasma is the source of several chemical reactions that lead to the hydroxyl radical formation. Hydroxyl radicals, (OH)-O-center dot, are very powerful and non-selective oxidizing agents (E-center dot OH/H2O degrees 2.8 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode) able to degrade compounds resistant to conventional treatment. GAD belongs to the group of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs).Under different working gases such as air, argon, oxygen/argon mixture (20/80, v/v), a BPA aqueous solution (120 mu M) was submitted to GAD. The evolution of BPA concentration was followed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. The global oxidation of the organic matter was followed by chemical oxygen demand (COD) measurement. The mineralization was determined from the total organic carbon (TOC). The GAD treatment of the aqueous solution is accompanied by a massive production of hydrogen peroxide. The addition of Fe (II) to the reaction allows a better elimination of the organic matter through the production of additional (OH)-O-center dot radicals, issued from the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide according to Fenton reaction.The optimized system - GAD with oxygen/argon (20/80) as working gas, in presence of Fe (II) - was very efficient for BPA treatment: the compound disappeared after 30 min, the abatement of the COD was total after 120 min and the TOC diminished by 70%.

Herein, we report a oleylamine-mediated (acting as the solvent, stabilizer, and reducing agent) strategy to synthesize intermetallic PdCu3 nanoparticles (NPs) without using any external reducing agent. Upon electrochemical cycling, PdCu3 transforms into Pd-rich PdCu (G(H)=0.05eV), exhibiting remarkably enhanced activity (with a current density of 25mAcm(-2) at approximate to 69mV overpotential) as an alternative to Pt for HER. The first-principle calculation suggests that formation of low coordination number Pd active sites alters the d-band center and hence optimal adsorption of hydrogen, leading to enhanced activity. This finding may provide guidelines towards the design and development of Pt-free highly active and robust electrocatalysts.									65	1	0	0	0	0	65			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000386953500006	27650407

The obtained OMC product was characterized by N-2 sorptometry, X-ray diffractometry and Raman spectroscopy. The mean pore radius of 2 nm and specific surface area of 712 m(2) g(-1) were found. The OMC sample was subjected to a complex electrochemical testing in order to check for its applicability in various energy conversion processes. For pure OMC, the charge storage properties and kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline solution were measured. The OMC sample delivered specific capacitance of 232 F g(-1) at 5 mV s(-1) with 83.6% capacitance retained at 100 mV s(-1). Effective ORR electrocatalysis by OMC in alkaline media was evidenced, with onset potential amounting to -0.10 V vs. saturated calomel electrode. A part of the OMC sample was used as a support of Pt nanoparticles, and examined as electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HOR) and ORR in acidic media. Reversible HOR kinetics was observed, while ORR performances were found to be competitive to the ones on other carbon-supported Pt electrocatalysts reported so far. A superb electrochemical behavior was correlated to physico-chemical properties of OMC. Described OMC stands out as a highly versatile material, which can be used to replace carbon materials developed for specific purposes, allowing rationalization of carbon-based technologies aimed for energy conversion purposes.

Here, we investigate electronic states of pristine manganese dioxides (MnO2) in different crystal phases using spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) with Hubbard U correction. Geometrical structures and band dispersions of alpha-, beta-, delta-, and lambda-MnO2 crystals with collinear magnetic [ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM)] orders are discussed in detail. We reveal that penalty energies that arise by violating the Goodenough-Kanamori rule are important and the origin of the magnetic interactions of the MnO2 crystals is governed by the super-exchange interactions of Mn-O-Mn groups. In addition, it is found that momentum-dependent band spin splitting occurs in the AFM alpha-, beta-, and delta-MnO2 crystals while no spin splitting occurs in the AFM lambda-MnO2 crystal. Our results show that spin-split band dispersions stem from the different orientations of Mn-centred oxygen octahedra. Such interesting electronic states of the MnO2 crystals are unraveled by our discussion on the relationship between the effective (spin-dependent) single-electron potentials and the space-group symmetry operations that map up-spin Mn atoms onto down-spin Mn atoms. This work provides a basis to understand the relationship between the spin-dependent electronic states and the crystallography of manganese oxides. Another relationship to the recent experimental observations of the photochemical oxygen evolution of MnO2 crystals is also discussed.									28	0	0	0	3	0	28			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000376138000019	27119122

However, the reported methods focused on fabricating nanostructures with one of the catalytically favorable structural factors, such as exposed facets, oxygen vacancies, morphology, or size. Herein, a unique method was developed to construct a Co3O4 nanostructure with high OER catalytic performance by integrating various catalytically favorable factors into the nanomaterial, such as a unique hollow morphology with a large surface area, abundant pores, rich defects and exposed high-index facets. Here, hollow pompon-like Co3O4 nanostructures (Co3O4-HPNSs) were controllably synthesized through a self-assembled encapsulation-calcination method. The fabricated nanostructure calcinated at 400 degrees C (Co3O4-HPNS-400) exhibits a high surface area of 233.5 m(2) g(-1) with a pore volume of 0.55 cm(3) g(-1). Surprisingly, the unique structure is rich in Stone-Wales-like defects and high-index facets of (311), (511) and (220). Due to these catalytically active structural characteristics, the fabricated Co3O4-HPNS-400 showed overpotentials of 308, 320, 348, and 370 mV for the OER at the current densities of 10, 20, 50 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, which are lower than those of Co3O4 nanowires (Co3O4-NWs). This study provides an efficient method to fabricate unique Co3O4 nanostructures with enhanced catalytic activity for the OER.									34	2	0	0	2	0	34			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000465152700037

By far, the exploration of more efficient photocatalysts with low environmental risk is still an important but challenging issue. In this study, the feasibility of using metal-free carbon nitride as environmental-friendly catalysts for photocatalytic decomplexation was demonstrated, using Cu(II)-EDTA as a model contaminant. A facile oxygen doping strategy could significantly enhance the interfacial separation of photogenerated holes, which was determined to be the most effective reactive species for decomplexation reactions. Compared to pristine g-C3N4, oxygen doped sample exhibited 2.5-fold enhanced photoactivity. The hypothesis of using decomplexation solution as sustainable resource for fabricating copper modified photocatalysts was further investigated. The in-situ formation of Cu or Cu2O resulted in the significantly improved activity for hydrogen evolution over recycled photocatalysts. According to the component analysis, chemical reduction strategy was beneficial for the sufficient recovery of copper ions, while the photoreduction method led to the most efficient utilization of copper metals. This study not only presents a promising method for the treatment of heavy metal-contaminated water, but also provides a sustainable way to utilize decomplexation solution as valuable resource for clean energy production.									26	0	0	0	6	0	26			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000430696500015		
J	Zhu, Zhen; Yang, Yan; Guan, Yue; Xue, Juanhong; Cui, Lili								Construction of a cobalt-embedded nitrogen-doped carbon material with the desired porosity derived from the confined growth of MOFs within graphene aerogels as a superior catalyst towards HER and ORR								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				4	40			15536	15545		10.1039/c6ta05196k				2016	2016	Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are vital in renewable energy technologies, such as water splitting and fuel cells. Nevertheless, increasing efforts have been paid to develop non-precious metal catalysts as alternatives to noble metal catalysts for HER and ORR. However, how to rationally design and construct an advantageous catalyst is still challenging. Here, a novel cobalt-embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene aerogel (Co-N-GA) catalyst is firstly rationally designed and synthesized by employing a facile strategy of implementing the confined growth of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) within graphene aerogels (GAs). It is worth noting that the Co-N-GA exhibits hierarchical porosity involving micropores, mesopores and macropores, as well as a high surface area (466.6 m(2) g(-1)). More importantly, benefiting from the synergetic effect of hierarchical porosity, high surface area, N-doped carbon and the inner Co metal, the catalyst Co-N-GA displays extraordinarily superior activity for both HER at various pH values and ORR along with better stability. Especially for HER, the onset overpotential, overpotentials@10, 100 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope on the catalyst Co-N-GA in 0.5 M H2SO4 are 0 mV, 46 mV, 183 mV and 33 mV dec(-1), respectively. Most importantly, these values are much lower than those of almost all prepared noble-metal-free HER catalysts, indicating the excellent activity for HER of our as-prepared catalyst Co-N-GA. Herein, our strategy opens a new platform to construct a variety of hierarchically porous GA-based catalysts that serve as superior electrocatalysts in energy storage and conversion technologies.									65	3	0	0	4	0	66			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000386310600032

However, the ORR process shows sluggish kinetics and requires platinum-group noble metal catalysts to accelerate the reaction. The high cost, rare reservation, and unsatisfied durability significantly impede large-scale commercialization of platinum-based catalysts. Single-atom electrocatalysts (SAECs) featuring with well-defined structure, high intrinsic activity, and maximum atom efficiency have emerged as a novel field in electrocatalytic science since it is promising to substitute expensive platinum-group noble metal catalysts. However, finely fabricating SAECs with uniform and highly dense active sites, fully maximizing the utilization efficiency of active sites, and maintaining the atomically isolated sites as single-atom centers under harsh electrocatalytic conditions remain urgent challenges. In this review, we summarized recent advances of SAECs in synthesis, characterization, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance, and applications in ORR-related H2O2 production, metal-air batteries, and low-temperature fuel cells. Relevant progress on tailoring the coordination structure of isolated metal centers by doping other metals or ligands, enriching the concentration of single-atom sites by increasing metal loadings, and engineering the porosity and electronic structure of the support by optimizing the mass and electron transport are also reviewed. Moreover, general strategies to synthesize SAECs with high metal loadings on practical scale are highlighted, the deep learning algorithm for rational design of SAECs is introduced, and theoretical understanding of active-site structures of SAECs is discussed as well. Perspectives on future directions and remaining challenges of SAECs are presented.									41	3	0	0	0	0	40				2639-5274		WOS:000559771300001	32864623

We consider the ORR in acidic conditions and critically evaluate the performance of unmodified and 2D-hBN modified electrodes, implementing coverage studies (commonly neglected in the literature) in order to ascertain the true impact of this novel nanomaterial. The behaviour of 2D-hBN towards the ORR is shown to be highly dependent upon both the underlying carbon substrate and the coverage/mass utilised. 2D-hBN modified SPEs are found to exhibit the most beneficial response towards the ORR, reducing the peak potential by ca. 0.28V when compared to an unmodified/bare SPE. Such improvements at this supporting substrate are inferred due to favourable 2D-hBN interaction with ridged surfaces exposing a high proportion of edge regions/sites, where conversely, we show that relatively smooth substrate surfaces (such as GC) are less conducive towards successful 2D-hBN immobilisation. In this paper, we reveal for the first time (in the specific case of using a rough supporting substrate) that 2D-hBN gives rise to beneficial electrochemical behaviour towards the ORR. Unfortunately, this material is not considered an electrocatalyst for use within fuel cells given that the estimated number of electrons transferred during the ORR ranges between 1.90-2.45 for different coverages, indicating that the ORR at 2D-hBN predominantly produces hydrogen peroxide. 2D-hBN does however have potential and should be explored further by those designing, fabricating and consequently electrochemically testing modified electrocatalysts towards the ORR.									39	0	0	0	2	0	39			1040-0397	1521-4109		WOS:000394998000041

Molybdenum disulfide is one of the most promising alternative catalysts but its intrinsic activity is still inferior to platinum. There is therefore a need to explore new active site origins in molybdenum disulfide with ultrafast reaction kinetics and to understand their mechanisms. Here, we report a universal cold hydrogen plasma reduction method for synthesizing different single atoms sitting on two-dimensional monolayers. In case of molybdenum disulfide, we design and identify a new type of active site, i.e., unsaturated Mo single atoms on cogenetic monolayer molybdenum disulfide. The catalyst shows exceptional intrinsic activity with a Tafel slope of 35.1 mV dec-1 and a turnover frequency of ~103 s-1 at 100 mV, based on single flake microcell measurements. Theoretical studies indicate that coordinately unsaturated Mo single atoms sitting on molybdenum disulfide increase the bond strength between adsorbed hydrogen atoms and the substrates through hybridization, leading to fast hydrogen adsorption/desorption kinetics and superior hydrogen evolution activity. This work shines fresh light on preparing highly-efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting and other electrochemical processes, as well as provides a general method to synthesize single atoms on two-dimensional monolayers.

Electrolyte regulation as a facile and scalable route receives less attention, and always requires oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs). Herein, we report azide molecule mediated electrolyte regulation to achieve OEC-free selective PEC reactions over a BiVO4 (BVO) photoanode. pH-sensitive 5-aminotetrazolium (5AT) acts as not only a substrate for the PEC azo coupling reaction but also a "liquid phase cocatalyst" to substantially facilitate charge transfer at the photoanode-electrolyte interface. In 5AT/Na2SO4 electrolyte, the azo coupling reaction occurs at pH > 4, whereas the water splitting reaction takes place at pH < 4, and polyaniline passivated BVO (BVO-PANI) exhibits a photocurrent density of 4.22 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE with an onset potential of 0.34 V-RHE and stable photocurrent density for 4 h. Meanwhile, 5AT as a "liquid phase cocatalyst" is universal for a variety of photoanodes, such as alpha-Fe2O3. Further, 5AT/NaVO3/Na2SO4 ternary electrolyte solution allows BVO-PANI to exhibit a photocurrent density of 5.1 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE with an onset potential of 0.27 V-RHE and stable PEC performance for 10 h. This work opens up a new avenue of electrolyte regulation to promote PEC performance and stability of photoanodes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000834544600001

However, the commercial application is hindered by the poor stability and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) dynamics in electrolytes. Thanks to the non noble bimetallic NiMoO4 nanosheet and atomic layer deposited TiO2 ultrathin film, we report a highly efficient and stable photoanode made of three-dimensional NiMoO4 nanosheet/TiO2 film/Si nanowire arrays. The NiMoO4/TiO2/Si composite PEC cell delivered a photocurrent density as high as 8.7 mA/cm(2) under 1 Sun illumination, which is 27 times higher than that of pristine TiO2 coated Si nanowires. Its onset potential was shifted toward the negative potential of 90 mV. The improved performance resulted from the synergistic effects of the favourable light trapping ability and the superior interface charge transfer related to the robust OER activity of NiMoO4 nanosheets.									66	5	0	0	1	0	67			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000400383300002

It is now generally accepted that cyanobacteria-like prokaryotes first evolved oxygenic photosynthesis, which was later conveyed via endosymbiosis into a eukaryotic host, which then gave rise to the different groups of algae and streptophytes. For photosynthetic CO2 fixation, all these organisms use RubisCO, which catalyses both the carboxylation and the oxygenation of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. One of the reaction products of the oxygenase reaction, 2-phosphoglycolate (2PG), represents the starting point of the photorespiratory C2 cycle, which is considered largely responsible for recapturing organic carbon via conversion to the Calvin-Benson cycle (CBC) intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate, thereby detoxifying critical intermediates. Here we discuss possible scenarios for the evolution of this process toward the well-defined 2PG metabolism in extant plants. While the origin of the C2 cycle core enzymes can be clearly dated back towards the different endosymbiotic events, the evolutionary scenario that allowed the compartmentalised high flux photorespiratory cycle is uncertain, but probably occurred early during the algal radiation. The change in atmospheric CO2/O2 ratios promoting the acquisition of different modes for inorganic carbon concentration mechanisms, as well as the evolutionary specialisation of peroxisomes, clearly had a dramatic impact on further aspects of land plant photorespiration.									38	1	0	0	37	0	40			1435-8603	1438-8677		WOS:000320730500003	23198988

Herein, we report the simple yet efficient inert gas-free direct fabrication of hierarchically porous interconnected O/N-codoped carbon nanosheets (designated as AC) and their application as excellent matrices for preparing selected Pt group metal (Ru, Rh, Ir) electrocatalysts toward alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The self-templating, self-activation and in-situ O/N-functionalization synthesis of AC is achieved via the one-pot pyrolysis of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tetra-sodium without additional inert gas. Compared with NC prepared via annealing the same precursor in N2 atmosphere, the as-formed AC with more mesoporous structure and oxygenated functional groups enables the fabrication of smaller and electron-rich Ru NPs, which deliver an optimal HER activity in terms of an extremely low overpotential of 7 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for HER, superior to that of Rh/AC, Ir/AC, Ru/NC, commercial Pt/C and plenty of previously fabricated Ru-based electrocatalysts. This "three-in-one" synthetic method demonstrates superior generality for other porous carbon materials by using potassium gluconate and potassium sodium tartrate as precursors.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000663706600003

In this study of a hydrothermal polycondensation of melamine/cyanuric acid, graphitic carbon nitride-based quantum dots (CNQD, similar to 2 nm) are in situ arranged along two orthogonal directions through lateral hydrogen bonding, and free-floating two-dimensional hydrogen-bonded films of CNQD (2D CNQD) are built. On the basis of the universality of this hydrothermal in situ supramolecular self-assembly technique, 2D films linked by other quantum dots such as sulfur-doped graphitic carbon nitride and CdTe are also constructed. With the benefits of stimuli responsiveness and the reversibility of hydrogen bonds, controllable assembly/disassembly of the 2D CNQD film is feasibly achieved by external stimuli such as inletting CO2/N2, which endows the assembled 2D CNQD films optimal electrochemical superiorities of both 2D film and zero-dimensional (0D) quantum dots. Accordingly, the 2D CNQD film delivers a high bifunctional activity in both a nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) and an oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Especially in NRR, it exhibits the high yield rate of NH3 reaching 75.07 mu g h-1 mg-1 at -0.85 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode at ambient condition. Strikingly, the power density of the rechargeable Zn-N2 battery using 2D CNQD film as cathode reaches 31.94 mW cm-2, outperforming the majority of Zn-N2 batteries. Density functional theory calculations proved the promoted adsorption of N2 and stabilized NRR intermediates on 2D CNQD cooperated by multiply hydrogen-bonding interactions are the main reasons for the excellent NRR electrocatalytic performances. This work hints that hydrothermal in situ supramolecular self-assembly is a feasible and direct way to integrate 0D quantum dots into 2D directional arrays, and the hydrogen bond that interlinks enables this free-floating 2D structure to maintain the electrochemical superiority of both 0D and 2D structures.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000820323000001	35695291

The preparation is based on 'anodic' aluminum oxide templates, which provide straight, cylindrical nanopores. Their walls are coated using atomic layer deposition (ALD) with a newly developed reaction which results in a metallic iridium layer. The ALD film growth is quantified by spectroscopic ellipsometry and X-ray reflectometry. The morphology and composition of the electrodes are characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Their catalytic activity is quantified for various pore geometries by cyclic voltammetry, steady-state electrolysis, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. With an optimal pore length of L approximate to 17-20 mu m, we achieve current densities of J = 0.28 mA cm(-2) at pH 5 and J = 2 .4 mA cm(-2) at pH 1. This platform is particularly competitive for achieving moderate current densities at very low overpotentials, that is, for a high degree of reversibility in energy storage.									24	0	2	0	1	0	26			2196-0216			WOS:000431624300004	29780685

Using quantum computation combined with experimental results of proximate analysis, ultimate analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), a structural model for the large molecular structure was constructed. By analyzing the bond lengths in the model molecule, the evolution lawfor the active structure of lignite was predicted for the process of low-temperature oxidation. In low-temperature oxidation, alkanes and hydroxyls are the primary active structures observed in lignite, though ether may also react. These active functional groups react with oxygen to release heat, thereby speeding up the reaction between coal and oxygen. Finally, the content of various functional groups in the process of lignite low-temperature oxidation was analyzed by infrared analysis, and the accuracy of the model was verified.

However, their higher catalysis is restrained by the difficulty in the synthesis of HEAs with desirable morphologies and deformed crystal lattice structures. In this work, an advanced approach was developed to fabricate the smallest possible HEA (i.e., MnFeCoNiCu) with deformed nanoparticles supported on the carbon cloth (CC) surface. The nanoparticles were characterized to be single face-centered cubic (FCC) crystals with highly deformed lattices, giving rise to various defects (such as twins, dislocations and stacking faults). The high surface tension caused by these defects leads to a substantial reduction in the overpotential down to 263 mV for the production of 10 mA cm(-2) with a very low Tafel slope of 43 mV dec(-1) and a rather small charge transfer resistance of 0.644 Omega in 1.0 M KOH, which is exceptionally lower than that of RuO2 and the state-of-the-art HEAs and competitive in comparison to most metal oxides. This work proves that the lattice deformation manipulates the displacement of atoms over the nanoparticle surface that facilitates their catalytic activities that are higher than those of the state-of-the-art counterparts reported in the literature. It also provides an insight into the performance improvement of other nanostructures in energy applications.									54	2	0	0	5	0	54			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000542473000028

Nuclear reaction rates and the nova outburst								Nuclear Physics A				A688	1-2			110	17		10.1016/S0375-9474(01)00679-0				21 May 2001	2001	Classical novae participate in the cycle of Galactic chemical evolution in which grains and metal enriched gas in their ejecta, supplementing those of supernovae, AGB stars, and WR stars, are a source of heavy elements for the ISM. Once in the diffuse gas, this material is cycled through molecular clouds before being incorporated into young stars and planetary systems during star formation. Infrared observations have confirmed the presence of carbon, SiC, hydrocarbons, and oxygen-rich silicate grains in nova ejecta, suggesting that some fraction of the pre-solar grains identified in meteoritic material may come from novae. The mean mass returned by a nova outburst to the ISM probably exceeds ~2times10-4 Modot. Using the observed nova rate of 35+or-11 per year in our Galaxy, it follows that novae introduce more than ~7times10-3 Modot yr-1 of processed matter into the ISM. It is likely, however, that novae ejecta are more massive than believed, and this value is a lower limit. Novae are expected to be the major source of 15N and 17O in the Galaxy and to contribute to the abundances of other isotopes in this atomic mass range. In order to understand better their contributions to Galactic chemical evolution, we have begun a series of studies with the latest nuclear reaction rate libraries. We report both on how these new rates affect the properties of the outburst and, in addition, how they change the predictions of the contributions of novae to Galactic chemical evolution.

It considers the effects of grain size distribution and sintering, and a new expression for the aggregation frequency, which takes into account the sintering mechanisms and synthesis method, is deduced. In order to validate the model, six copper -based oxygen carriers were synthesized by excess wet impregnation and by incipient impregnation. They were characterized by BET surface area, BJH porosimetry, and SEM microscopy. Model results were compared with experimental data acquired by thermogravimetry during several redox cycles and the model was able to predict the conversion drop over the course of redox cycles due to sintering. It was found that copper-based oxygen carriers synthesized by incipient impregnation are more strongly affected by sintering than those prepared via excess wet impregnation, and finally it is shown that metallic copper sinters during oxidation, resolving a controversy in this regard that has existed in the literature.

The double pulse electrodeposition is a round-trip pulse method and a differential pulse method. When a uniform magnetic field is used in combination with a double pulse electrodeposition method, the palladium-metal bifunctional catalyst obtained is a layered structure in which palladium and metal are alternately deposited, and the structure mainly reflects the catalytic activity of oxygen reduction. USE - Preparation of bifunctional catalyst (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The method can effectively improve the catalyst particle size and improve catalytic activity, and is concise, efficient and suitable for large-scale industrial production. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Preparation of bifunctional catalyst involves preparing mesoporous carbon matrix by magneto-electrodeposition which adopts ZIFs carbonized component to wrap nitrogen-doped defect mesoporous carbon as a catalyst carrier, using mixed solution of palladium ion and transition metal ion (M2+) as sedimentation solution, using magnetron pulse electrodeposition method by double pulse electrodeposition and magnetic field coupling, obtaining palladium-metal (PdM) bifunctional catalyst, and adjusting different magnetic fields to prepare preparing palladium-metal (PdM) bifunctional catalysts with different morphologies and functions. The double pulse electrodeposition is a round-trip pulse method and a differential pulse method. The magnetic field is one or more of uniform magnetic field, rotating magnetic field and pulsed magnetic field. When a uniform magnetic field is used in combination with a double pulse electrodeposition method, the palladium-metal (PdM) bifunctional catalyst obtained is a layered structure in which palladium and metal (M) are alternately deposited, and the structure mainly reflects the catalytic activity of oxygen reduction. When the rotating or/and pulsed magnetic field is combined with the double-pulse electrodeposition method, the palladium-metal (PdM) bifunctional catalyst obtained has a core-shell structure of cobalt and/or zinc core palladium shell, in which the structure mainly reflects the catalytic activity of hydrogen evolution.

It is a key factor affecting the efficiencies of electrocatalytic reactions conducted in aqueous solution, e.g., electrocatalytic water splitting and glucose oxidation reaction (GOR). However, electrocatalytic OER still suffers from problems like high overpotential, sluggish kinetics, and over-reliance on expensive noble-metal-based catalysts. Herein, 15 nm thick carbonbased shell coated tungsten oxide (CTO) nanospheres are loaded on nickel foam to form CTO/NF. An enhanced electrocatalytic OER is triggered on CTO/NF, with the overpotential at 50 mA cm(-2) (317 mV) and the Tafel slope (70 mV dec(-1)) on CTO/NF lower than those on pure tungsten oxide (360 mV, 117 mV dec(-1)) and noble-metal-based IrO2 catalysts (328 mV, 96 mV dec(-1)). A promoted electrocatalytic GOR is also achieved on CTO/NF, with efficiency as high as 189 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2). The carbon-based shell on CTO is flexible for electron transfer between catalyst and reactants and provides catalytically active sites. This improves reactant adsorption and O-H bond dissociation on the catalyst, which are key steps in OER and GOR. The carbon-based shell on CTO retains the catalyst as nanospheres with a higher surface area, which facilitates OER and GOR. It is the multiple roles of the carbon-based shell that increases the electrocatalytic efficiency. These results are helpful for fabricating more efficient noble-metal-free electrocatalysts.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000603397200025	33307676

The electronic structure calculations based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) formalism, have been performed along with the corresponding optical properties of functionalized and S-mono-vacancy defected 1T PdS2 monolayer. The optimum band gap required for water splitting makes this two-dimensional material an exciting promise for photocatalysis process. In this work, we have not only envisaged the photocatalytic activity, but also the specific reaction coordinates for HER and OER based on the adsorption energies of the intermediates of the individual reaction. Functionalization of 1T PdS2 monolayer is done by replacing the anion (S) site with P, N and C functionalized atoms and also by creating a mono-vacancy defect at the same site. We have also determined (i) the stability of the functionalized 1T PdS2 monolayer based on the phonon dispersion calculations and (ii) the respective work function of the individual systems. The steady optical response in the visible range is in favour of the photocatalytic activity of the monolayer, while the corresponding reaction coordinates predict the suitability of the functionalized and defected monolayer for HER and OER mechanism. The mono-vacancy defected and Nfunctionalized PdS2 monolayer have emerged as the most promising systems for OER and HER activities respectively. Overall, we have predicted that the bifunctional catalytic activity can be achieved through functionalization and vacancy defect in PdS2 monolayer.									29	2	0	0	1	0	29			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000434829500034

XRD and SEM results show that crystal phase and morphology of NixSy have been greatly affected by the surface treatment of NF. XRD results show that the mixture crystal phases of NixSy have been obtained on both acid-treated NF (NF(a)) and oxidant treated NF (NF(o)). Nix SyINF(a) contains Ni3S2 and NiS, whereas NixSy/NF(0) has Ni3S2 and NiS2, implying different crystal phases derived from different surface treatment of NF. SEM images also reveal the different morphology of two samples based on pre-treatment support. NixSy/NF(a) displays unique conical agglomeration surrounded by porous structure. NixSy/NF(o) has the disorder stacking structure of nanosheets. Electrochemical measurements for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) show the enhanced performances of NixSyINF(a) than NixSy/NF(o) and pure Ni3S2/NF as contrast samples, implying that NiS outperforms other types of NixSy. The mechanisms of sulfurization path of different surface-treated NF have been discussed. The facile surface treatment of NF may provide a new strategy to prepare excellent electrocatalysts for OER.

Ultra-thin beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanoplates have a large surface area of 139.0 m(2) g(-1), associated with more exposed surface Ni species, and exhibit better catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) than that of thick beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanoplates previously reported. Compared to beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanoplates alone and MWCNTs + Ni(OH)(2) nanoplate physical mixture, the composite exhibits much higher electrocatalytic OER activity in terms of low onset overpotential, small Tafel slope, large exchange current density and high OER catalytic current densities at specific applied potentials. The Tafel slope of 87 mV dec(-1) for the composite in pH 13 KOH is much smaller than that of beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanoplates (165 mV dec(-1)) and their physical mixture (140 mV dec(-1)). The enhanced catalytic activity of the MWCNTs/Ni(OH)(2) composite could be ascribed to the synergic interface of MWCNTs and ultra-thin beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanoplates for improved conductivity, efficient chemical transfer and high oxidation state of Ni species in the composite electrodes by introducing MWCNTs. No obvious degradation of the OER catalytic current density of the composite electrode over a period of six hours was observed.									111	2	0	0	2	0	113			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000339535100034

Traditional synthetic methods for sulfinamides are often confronted with various challenges, such as tedious reaction steps, harsh reaction conditions. Direct activation of S-H and N-H bonds to synthesis sulfinamides is the most effective and atomic economic way, which can realize the N-S bonds construction without pre-functionalization of the substrates. To establish a versatile and efficient technology for such reaction, an electrochemical cross coupling hydrogen evolution (CCHE) reaction, which is often used as an environmentally friendly and efficient way to construct new bonds, for synthesis of sulfinamides has been successfully developed by using thiols and amines as the easily available and inexpensive substrates. A series of sulfinamides were prepared with excellent yields and good compatibility of functional groups under extremely mild reaction conditions. Experimental results showed that sulfenamides, which were constructed as intermediate products via radical pathway, were further oxidized to sulfinamides. H-2 O-18 labeling experiment confirmed that the oxygen of sulfinyl group comes from the trace water in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP). In addition, tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) played important dual roles of intermediate and electrolyte in this reaction system. The typical procedure is as follows: A 20 mL oven-dried reaction vital equipped with a magnetic stir bar was charged with thiol 1 (0.2 mmol), amine 2 (0.3 mmol) and TBAI (0.05 mol/L) in HFIP (5 mL), and exhausted via puncture needle for 15 minutes with argon. The mixture was then electrolysed with carbon foam plate (anode) and platinum plate (cathode) as the electrodes in an undivided cell for 6 hours in 10 mA constant current at room temperature. After the reaction, the mixture was evaporated under reduced pressure to remove the solvent and the residue was purified by chromatography on silica gel to get the desired sulfinamide 3.									9	4	0	0	0	0	9			0567-7351			WOS:000488209300009

Herein, three-dimensional (3D) alpha-MnO2 and epsilon-MnO2 hierarchical star-like architectures with tunable crystal phases and desirable ORR activity were readily prepared by a facile hydrothermal method with no surfactants or templates. The effects of reaction temperature, anion type, and dwell time on the morphologies of the MnO2 products were studied in detail, and the possible formation mechanism of the 3D MnO2 hierarchical stars was proposed. Due to the improved electrical conductivity and O-2 adsorption ability, the resulting alpha-MnO2 catalyst showed substantially enhanced ORR activity, compared to the epsilon-MnO2 and bulk MnO2 catalysts, with a more positive onset potential, a larger limiting current density, and better durability. Our results provide a facile chemical route towards the phase-controlled synthesis of 3D MnO2 architectures, which can serve as efficient catalysts for ORR-based applications.									44	4	0	0	2	0	45			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000387166900021

Detailed characterization of the preparation showed that the complex was a monomer having no light harvesting proteins attached. This core reaction centre complex had, however, a range of low molecular mass intrinsic proteins as well as the chlorophyll binding proteins CP43 and CP47 and the reaction centre proteins D1 and D2. Of particular note was the presence of a stoichiometric level of PsbW, a low molecular weight protein not present in PSII of cyanobacteria. Despite the high oxygen evolution rate, the core complex did not retain the PsbQ extrinsic protein although there was close to a full complement of PsbO and PsbR and partial level of PsbP. However, reconstitution of PsbP and PsbPQ was possible. The presence of PsbP in absence of LHCII and other chlorophyll a/b binding proteins confirms that LHCII proteins are not a strict requirement for the assembly of this extrinsic polypeptide to the PSII core in contrast with the conclusion of Caffarri et al. (2009).									16	0	0	0	14	0	16			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000290318400005	21487931	
J	Liu, Yuchuan; Huang, Baobing; Xie, Zailai								Hydrothermal synthesis of core-shell MoO2/alpha-Mo2C heterojunction as high performance electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				427				693	701		10.1016/j.apsusc.2017.08.098				JAN 1 2018	2018	Cost-effective electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction are attractive for energy conversion and storage processes. Herein, a variety of molybdenum-based catalysts have been synthesized by means of a simple hydrothermal method using cyclodextrin as structural guiding agent and carbon source. With optimizing the usage of cyclodextrin, both molybdenum oxidate and alpha-type molybdenum carbide can be controllable synthesized in terms of phase composition, morphology and porosity. X-ray diffraction patterns and high resolution transition electronic images show that the as-prepared sample appears a core-shell structure of MoO2/alpha-Mo2C heterojunction. Surprisingly, such heterojunction as an electrocatalyst exhibits a remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with low overpotential of 100 mV in alkaline electrolyte, and of 152 mV in acidic condition at a current density 10 mA/cm(2), with very low Tafel slope of 50 mV/dec and 65 mV/dec, respectively. This specific activity of presented material is found to be superior to those of the most active Mo-based electrocatalysts reported so far. We believe that our finding of cost-effective electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction would open the door for future studies and applications of molybdenum compounds. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this direction, the present work reports on the synthesis of N, Ru codoped pellet drum bundle-like antimony sulfide (Sb2S3) via a simple reflux method. Subsequent HER and HOR electrocatalytic investigations in 1 M KOH revealed their suitability as an efficient and inexpensive alternative to platinum, as is evident from the overpotential (72 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)), Tafel slope (193 mV/decade), exchange current density (1.42 mA/cm(2)), and breakdown potential at similar to 0.6 V vs RHE, respectively. Such remarkable HER and HOR performance of N, Ru codoped Sb2S3 could be ascribed to the presence of relatively larger active sites compared to Sb2S3 and N-doped Sb2S3 individually due to synergistic effects arising from N and Ru dopants. Further, N, Ru codoped Sb2S3 demonstrated high intrinsic catalytic activity as indicated by its turnover frequency (2.03 s(-1)) and current loss, corresponding to 35% after 10 h of continuous amperometric i-t operation. Alternatively, such excellent catalytic performance of N, Ru codoped Sb2S3 arises due to geometric lattice defects with surface oxygen vacancy, and the availability of abundant edges and its pellet drum-like morphology also cannot be overruled.									16	1	0	0	2	0	16			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000514256400025	31944656

Our previous results showed that Ir-Sn-Sb-O possesses electrocatalytic activity for an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media. In the present work, the physicochemical characterization and performance of Ir-Sn-Sb-O in an electrolysis cell are reported. IrO2 supported on antimony doped tin oxide (ATO) was also considered in this study as a reference catalyst. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images indicated that Ir-Sn-Sb-O has a mixed morphology with nanometric size. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) showed a heterogeneous atomic distribution. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis resulted in particle sizes of IrO2 and ATO between 3 to >10 nm, while the Ir-Sn-Sb-O catalyst presented non-uniform particle sizes from 3 to 50 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements indicated that synthesized mixed oxide consists of IrO2, IrOx, doped SnO2 phases and metallic Ir. The Ir-Sn-Sb-O mixed composition was corroborated by temperature programmed reduction (TPR) measurements. The performance of Ir-Sn-Sb-O in a single cell electrolyser showed better results for hydrogen production than IrO2/ATO using a mechanical mixture. Ir-Sn-Sb-O demonstrated an onset potential for water electrolysis close to 1.45 V on Ir-Sn-Sb-O and a current density near to 260 mA mg(-1) at 1.8 V. The results suggest that the mixed oxide Ir-Sn-Sb-O has favorable properties for further applications in water electrolysers.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2073-4344		WOS:000546007000046

Prolonged irradiation of the WO3-H2O-Fe2+/Fe3+ system led to the generation of O-2 and H-2, and the yields could be sustained for a period of several days. The product yields showed a dependence on the duration of irradiation, illumination wavelength, WO3 concentration, concentration of Fe3+ and Fe2+ cations, type of iron (LII) salt, and pH. The optimum photoproduction for O-2 and H-2 was Obtained under the following operating conditions: [WO3]; 8 g dm(-3), [Fe3+]: 14-20 mol dm(-3), pH 1.5-2.5, and illumination wavelength: 200-500 nm. The illumination time needed to reach the stationary state was ca. 6 and 30 h for the inner- and outer-irradiation systems, respectively. In addition to these conditions, a ratio of [Fe2+]:[Fe3+] = 2-4 was found to be suitable for the simultaneous production of O-2 and H-2. The product yields from the annular photoreactor were usually about four times more than those from an outer-irradiation photoreactor. When Fe-2(SO4)(3) was replaced by Fe(NO3)(3) or FeCl3 as a sourer of Fe3+ species, higher initial O-2 evolution rates were obtained but the long term yields were lower than those from dispersions containing Fe-2(SO4)(3). The studied system utilized WO3 to accomplish the initial light absorption, charge separation and O-2 evolution in the presence of Fe(aq)(2+)species as an electron acceptor, and then relied on the Fe-aq(2+) photochemical process to produce hydrogen. The overall reaction was photodecomposition of water into O-2 and H-2. Mechanistic implications were considered to account for the probable reaction steps leading to the products observed and the dependence of the yields on the examined reaction parameters.

Theoretical and experimental investigations of a model cathode material, Li-rich layered Li2IrO3, have been performed to study the structural and electronic changes induced by electrochemical delithiation in a lithium-ion cell. First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to compute the voltage profile of a Li/Li2-xIrO3 cell at various states of charge, and the results were in good agreement with electrochemical data. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES), resonant/nonresonant X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES), and first-principles core-level spectra simulations using the Bethe Salpeter Equation (BSE) approach were used to probe the change in oxygen electronic states over the x = 0-1.5 range. The correlated Ir M-3-edge XANES and 0 K-edge XANES data provided evidence that oxygen hole states form during the early stage of delithiation at similar to 3.5 V because of the interaction between O p and Ir d states, with Ir-oxidation being the dominant source of electrochemical capacity. At higher potentials, the charge capacity was predominantly attributed to oxidation of the O2- ions. It is argued that the emergence of oxygen holes alone is not necessarily indicative of electrochemical capacity beyond transition-metal oxidation because oxygen hole states can appear as a result of enhanced mixing of O p and Ir d states. Prevailing mechanisms accounting for the oxygen redox mechanism in Li-rich materials were examined by theoretical and experimental Xray spectroscopy; however, no unambiguous spectroscopic signatures of oxygen dimer interactions or nonbonding oxygen states were identified.									18	0	0	0	2	0	18			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000473248400004

These catalysts are used to increase the efficiency of otherwise sluggish oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). However, although the agglomerated metal nanoparticles are usually easy to form, they are very difficult to remove due to the protective surface-coating carbon layers, a factor that significantly hampers SAM-N/C fabrication. Herein, we report a one-step pyrolysis approach to successfully fabricate single cobalt atom Co-N/C (SACo-N/C) by using a Co2+SCN- coordination compound as the metal precursor. Thanks to the decomposition of Co2+SCN- compound at lower temperature than that of carbon layer deposition, Co-rich particles grow up to larger ones before carbon layers formation. Even though encapsulated by the carbon layers, it is difficult for the large Co-rich particle to be completely sealed. And thus, it makes the Co atoms possible to escape from incomplete carbon layer, to coordinate with nitrogen atoms, and to form SACo-N/C catalysts. This SACo-N/C exhibits excellent performances for both ORR (half-wave potential of 0.878 V) and HER (overpotential at 10 mA/cm(2) of 178 mV), and is thus a potential replacement for Pt-based catalysts. When SACo-N/C is integrated into a Zn-O-2 battery, battery with high open-circuit voltage (1.536 V) has high peak power density (266 mW/cm(2)) and large gravimetric energy density (755 mA h/g(zn)) at current densities of 100 mA/cm(2). Thus, we believe that this strategy may offer a new direction for the effective generation of SAM-N/C catalysts. (C) 2019 Science China Press. Published by Elsevier B.V. and Science China Press.

The initial silica growth kinetics, its oxygen partial pressure dependence, MoO3 evaporation rate and the microstructural evolution during oxidation have been examined. The oxidation exposure was carried out in the temperature range from 673 to 873 K in flowing oxygen or mixtures of argon and oxygen gases. The major analytical techniques include X-ray powder diffractometry, spectroscopic ellipsometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and BET method. It is shown that silica growth rate at 773 It decreases with time and the square of silica thickness increases with the oxygen partial pressure. Evaporation rate of MoO3 powder increases exponentially with increasing temperature in the range from 823 to 973 K in flowing O-2 Accumulation of Mo-rich phase, presumably MoO3, in the thick silica layer was readily seen at 723 K.

The fact that only a small fraction of the dissolved noble metals reaches the substrate represents a serious obstacle to this common procedure. We therefore chose a different path. It was found that the HER activity of Ni42 alloy drastically increased (eta=140mV at j=10mAcm(-2); pH1) when a platinum counter electrode was used during polarization experiments in acid. This improvement was caused by a platinum transfer from the platinum anode to the steel cathode, a process which occurred simultaneously to the hydrogen evolution. The negligible accumulation of Pt (26 mu g) in the electrolyte turns this straight-forward transfer procedure into a highly cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and waste reducing approach for the generation of cheap, stable and effective HER electrodes.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000496877300048	31539189

In this work, MnO2 supported on CeO2-QDs (CeO2-QDs@MnO2) and CeO2-QDs supported on MnO2 (MnO2@CeO2-QDs) composite with different loading method were synthesized to investigate the role of CeO2 for ORR, according to the excellent oxygen adsorption and oxygen ion conductivity of CeO2 quantum dots (CeO2-QDs). A passive DMFC was assembled by CeO2-QDs@MnO2 or MnO2@CeO2-QDs as cathodic catalyst and PtRu/C as anodic catalyst. The maximum power densities for CeO2-QDs@MnO2 and MnO2@CeO2-QDs-based DMFCs were 9.4 and 7.8 mW.cm(-2), while 8.5 and 7.0 mW.cm(-2) for air-breathing DMFCs, respectively. CeO2-QDs@MnO2 showed a more superior ORR activity and stability in the high discharge currents especially for air-breathing DMFCs. The temporary storage and timely replenishment mechanism of oxygen in CeO2-QDs@MnO2 catalyst could significantly enhance the ORR efficiency at cathode. This work developed a new thought about the loading method of CeO2 on the ORR catalytic activity for CeO2/MnO2 catalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0926-860X	1873-3875		WOS:000721698200007

The fate of biogenic O-2 prior to its appearance in the atmosphere remains speculative, but recent work suggests that O-2 was locally available within the surface ocean to support aerobic microbial ecosystems. Simple mass balance predicts that locally oxygenated environments (oxygen oases) could exist in areas of high productivity if the local rate of O-2 production by oxygenic photosynthesis exceeded the combined rate of O-2 loss by a number of processes (e. g., exchange with the atmosphere, transport within the ocean, reaction with reduced aqueous species, biological consumption). The areal extent of these environments and the dissolved O-2 concentrations that could have persisted in an otherwise anoxic ocean, however, are key uncertainties in our understanding of the spatiotemporal redox-evolution of the early earth system.We use an earth system model of intermediate complexity that has been modified to simulate a theoretical Archean biosphere in order to explore redox heterogeneity in the late Archean surface ocean. We demonstrate that oxygen oases are an expected consequence of oxygenic photosynthesis beneath an essentially O-2-devoid atmosphere-and that oxygenated surface waters need not be restricted to shallow coastal environments or microbial mats. Within oxygen oases, O-2 concentrations locally approach similar to 1-10 mu M for a large range of plausible Archean conditions. Although O-2 concentrations in the open ocean are exceedingly low, biologically relevant dissolved O-2 concentrations are widespread in our hypothetical surface ocean. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring at the electrolyser anode is central to the development of a clean, reliable and emission-free hydrogen economy. The development of robust and highly active anode materials for OER is therefore a great challenge and has been the main focus of research. Among potential candidates, perovskites have emerged as promising OER electrocatalysts. In this study, by combining a scalable cutting-edge synthesis method with time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements, we were able to capture the dynamic local electronic and geometric structure during realistic operando conditions for highly active OER perovskite nanocatalysts. Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta as nano-powder displays unique features that allow a dynamic self-reconstruction of the material's surface during OER, that is, the growth of a self-assembled metal oxy(hydroxide) active layer. Therefore, besides showing outstanding performance at both the laboratory and industrial scale, we provide a fundamental understanding of the operando OER mechanism for highly active perovskite catalysts. This understanding significantly differs from design principles based on ex situ characterization techniques.									462	19	0	0	39	0	466			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000408591300015	28714982

However, very complex synthetic strategies, extensive functionalization processes, and less stability have stimulated quest for economically viable, straightforward and facile preparative methods for designing stable, robust and active nanoscale electrocatalysts engaging geologically abundant materials to ensure their industrial implications. Here we present surface-assembled Fe(OH)(x)/FeOx type colloidal catalytic thin-films, with or without post annealing, derived from Fe-colloidal NPs in simple carbonate system for efficient water oxidation. Comprehensive electrochemical studies including cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, chronopotentiometry, impedance spectroscopy, Tafel slope analysis, mass activity, electrochemically active surface area measurements are conducted to comparatively evaluate the performance of simple (FeOx/HCO3-@FTO and annealed (FeOx/HCO3-@FTO250, FeOx/HCO3-@FTO500) catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under employed conditions. The FeOx/HCO3-@FTO250 annealed at 250 degrees C initiates water oxidation at much lower overpotential of 1.52 V vs. RHE with remarkable stability during long-term electrochemical experimentations. In addition to enhanced OER activity as evidence by better onset potential (<1.55 V vs. RHE), lower Tafel slope value (36 mV dec(1-)) and negligible charge transfer resistance, the Fe(OH)(x)/HCO3-@FTO type catalyst presented excellent electroactive nature during long term controlled potential electrolysis experiments where more and more electroactive sites were getting exposed during continuous hours of electrolysis. The catalysts behave as a potential enduring, inexpensive and competent candidate for catalyzing water oxidation reaction when tested under begin conditions.

J	Chu, Ke; Cheng, Yong-hua; Li, Qing-qing; Liu, Ya-ping; Tian, Ye								Fe-doping induced morphological changes, oxygen vacancies and Ce3+-Ce3+ pairs in CeO2 for promoting electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				8	12			5865	5873		10.1039/c9ta14260f				MAR 28 2020	2020	Developing active and robust catalysts for the electrocatalytic N-2 reduction reaction (NRR) represents a promising strategy for ambient NH3 production but remains challenging. Herein, CeO2 was modulated by Fe-doping for the NRR in neutral media. Fe-doping was found to induce the morphological change of CeO2 from crystalline nanoparticles to partial-amorphous nanosheets which contained abundant oxygen vacancies (V-O), resulting in more exposed active sites and accelerated electron transport. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further revealed that the coexistence of the Fe dopant and its adjacent V-O enabled the creation of Ce3+-Ce3+ pairs which served as the most active centers for effectively catalyzing the NRR and suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction. These Fe-doping induced synergistic effects led to a significantly enhanced NRR performance of Fe-CeO2 with an NH3 yield of 26.2 mu g h(-1) mg(-1) (-0.5 V) and a faradaic efficiency of 14.7% (-0.4 V). Therefore, this metal-doping induced multifunctionality will open up new opportunities to design powerful NRR catalysts for N-2 fixation.									106	17	0	0	2	0	107			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000526703800005		
J	WILHELM, SR; SCHIFF, SL; ROBERTSON, WD								CHEMICAL FATE AND TRANSPORT IN A DOMESTIC SEPTIC SYSTEM - UNSATURATED AND SATURATED ZONE GEOCHEMISTRY								ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY				13	2			193	203		10.1002/etc.5620130203				FEB 1994	1994	Monitoring the septic system at a single-family home provides quantitative information on geochemical evolution of septic-tank effluent along its travel path. In both the unsaturated and saturated (groundwater) zones, microbiological and chemical reactions occur that bring the effluent closer to equilibrium with the subsurface conditions. In the unsaturated zone, 90% of the DOC is removed from the effluent, mostly by aerobic oxidation, and NH4+ in the effluent is almost completely oxidized to N0(3)(-). As these reactions occur in the tile field, the oxygen content of the soil gas is partially depleted. Calcite dissolution from the soils in the unsaturated zone buffers the acidity of the oxidation reactions and increases Ca2+ concentrations. In the saturated zone, organic carbon oxidation in the effluent plume apparently decreases dissolved oxygen concentrations to <1.0 mg/L. Potassium is retarded relative to other cations, and dissolved PO(4)(3-)from the effluent is detectable in the ground water directly beneath the tile field but appears to be advancing very slowly, if at all, within the plume. In addition NO3- concentrations remain above drinking-water standards (10 mg/L NO3--N) in the groundwater plume.									58	0	0	0	33	1	58			0730-7268	1552-8618		WOS:A1994MV34900003

Here, we propose a facile hydrothermal treatment strategy to prepare porous Fe-incorporated NiSe microspheres via in situ selenization of iron-nickel foam. The as-obtained 3D integrated anode demonstrates excellent electrocatalytic performance towards OER in concentrated alkaline media (1.0 M KOH), with a small onset overpotential of 170 mV, an overpotential as low as 236 mV to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm(-2), and a small Tafel slope of 53 mV dec(-1). The overpotential at 50 mA cm(-2)shows no obvious change during the whole durability test for 24 h, indicating long-term stable electrocatalytic activity. Characterizations of the electrode after stability test reveal the oxidation of the crystallized Fe-incorporated NiSe microspheres which probably generates amorphous Ni(Fe)OOH. The microspheres were partially dissolved and connected with each other to form a wormlike porous structure. The superior OER activity is largely attributed to the highly active Fe-Ni selenide and derived oxyhydroxide of 3D porous structure on the FeNi foam substrate. The facile synthesis strategy in this work can be conveniently applied to the preparation of a variety of selenides of metal foams with different compositions as highly efficient electrocatalysts.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000558617600005

However, the extreme sensitivity of [FeFe] hydrogenases to oxygen presents a major challenge for exploiting these organisms to achieve sustainable photosynthetic hydrogen production. In this study, the mechanism of oxygen inactivation of the [FeFe] hydrogenase CrHydA1 from C. reinhardtii has been investigated. X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows that reaction with oxygen results in destruction of the [4Fe-4S] domain of the active site H-cluster while leaving the di-iron domain (2Fe(H)) essentially intact. By protein film electrochemistry we were able to determine the order of events leading up to this destruction. Carbon monoxide, a competitive inhibitor of CrHydA1 which binds to an Fe atom of the 2FeH domain and is otherwise not known to attack FeS clusters in proteins, reacts nearly two orders of magnitude faster than oxygen and protects the enzyme against oxygen damage. These results therefore show that destruction of the [4Fe-4S] cluster is initiated by binding and reduction of oxygen at the di-iron domain-a key step that is blocked by carbon monoxide. The relatively slow attack by oxygen compared to carbon monoxide suggests that a very high level of discrimination can be achieved by subtle factors such as electronic effects (specific orbital overlap requirements) and steric constraints at the active site.									245	4	0	0	139	0	249			0027-8424			WOS:000270754400022	19805068

Biol. 16:689-698, 1991). The present study was conducted to determine if the amount of other polypeptides of the oxygen-evolving complex and the oxygen-evolving activity also decreased in CMV(Y)-inoculated tobacco leaves. The amount of a 33-kDa polypeptide, which is essential to oxygen evolution, did not decrease in CMV(Y)-inoculated leaves showing early symptoms, although the amount of 22- and 23-kDa polypeptides began to decrease. However, comparative analysis of electron transport in thylakoid membranes indicated that the oxygen-evolving activity in CMV(Y)-inoculated tobacco leaves was only partly reduced, compared with the activity in CMV(O)-inoculated tobacco leaves which did not show clear symptoms. Partial inhibition of the oxygen-evolving activity, by a differential decrease in the amount of polypeptides of the oxygen-evolving complex, seems to be associated with the primary molecular Process of symptom expression in CMV(Y)-inoculated tobacco leaves.									26	2	0	0	23	0	27			0894-0282			WOS:A1992HT30900011	1421513

The plasma-etched graphene was then used as a metal-free electrocatalyst in a solid acid fuel cell. Scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to characterize the graphene layers. Alternating-current impedance spectroscopy of a hybrid electrode containing the plasma-etched graphene and cesium dihydrogen phosphate as proton-conducting solid acid illustrated its remarkable catalytic activity under cathodic conditions. Thus, both O-2 and N-2 plasma treatment activated the material. While O-2 plasma was a more effective activator than N-2 plasma, it also resulted in higher degradation rates. A combination of density functional theory calculations and experimental results indicated that zigzag carbon was the most active site for the oxygen reduction reaction on both O-2 and N-2 plasma-etched graphene. Furthermore, the armchair carbons adjacent to the surface oxygen groups and doped heteroatoms were also important active sites for O-2 and N-2 plasma-etched graphene, respectively. The results of this study will guide future endeavors in the development of non-precious metal catalysts for use as fuel cell cathodes.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521200000017

The [Ir(OH)(6)](2-) solution, made by alkaline hydrolysis of [IrCl6](2-), is colorless and stable near neutral pH, and forms blue IrOx center dot nH(2)O nanoparticle suspensions once it is adjusted to acidic or basic conditions. IrOx center dot nH(2)O nanoparticle thin films are grown anodically on glassy carbon, fluorine-doped tin oxide, and gold electrodes by electrolyzing [Ir(OH)(6)](2-) solutions at +1.0-1.3 V versus Ag/AgCl. The thickness of the IrOx center dot nH(2)O films can be controlled by varying the concentration of [Ir(OH)(6)](2-), the deposition potential, and/or the deposition time. These thin films are stable between pH 1 and 13 and have the lowest overpotential (eta) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of any yet reported. Near neutral pH, the Tafel slope for the OER at a IrOx center dot nH(2)O film/Au rotating disk electrode was 37-39 mV per decade. The exchange current density for the OER was 4-8 x 10(-10) A cm(-2) at a 4 mC cm(-2) coverage of electroactive Ir.									107	1	0	0	11	0	108			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000293636600032	21678551	
J	Schansker, G; van Rensen, JJS				Schansker, Gert/AAI-5844-2020				Performance of active Photosystem II centers in photoinhibited pea leaves								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				62	2-3			175	184		10.1023/A:1006374707722				DEC 1999	1999	Effects of photoinhibition on photosynthesis in pea (Pisum sativum L.) leaves were investigated by studying the relationship between the severity of a photoinhibitory treatment (measured as F(v)/F(m)) and several photoacoustic and chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters. Because of the observed linear relationship between the decline of F(v)/F(m) and the potential oxygen evolution rate determined by the photoacoustic method, the parameter F(v)/F(m) was used as an indicator for the severity of photoinhibition. Our analysis revealed that part of the Photosystem II (PS II) reaction centers is inactive in oxygen evolution and is also less sensitive to photoinhibition. Correcting the parameter q(P) (fraction of open PS II reaction centers) for inactive PS II centers unveiled a strong increase of q(P) in severely inhibited pea leaves, indicating that the inactivated active centers do no longer contribute to q(P) and that photoinhibition has an all or none effect on PS II centers. Analysis of q(E) (energy quenching) demonstrated its initial increase possibly associated with dephosphorylation of LHC II. Analysis of q(I) (photoinhibition dependent quenching) showed that the half-time of recovery of q(I) increases steeply below an F(v)/F(m) of 0.65. This increase of the relaxation half-time corresponds with a decrease of the electron transport rate J and tentatively indicates that the supply of ATP, needed for the recovery, starts to decrease. The data indicate the necessity of correcting for inactive centers in order to make valuable conclusions about effects of photoinhibition on photosynthetic parameters.									21	18	0	0	28	0	41			0166-8595			WOS:000086528900007

The reaction is rich in bifurcation scenarios, from period-doubling to peak-adding mixed mode oscillations. Here, we study a state-of-the-art model of the peroxidase-oxidase reaction. Using the model, we report systematic numerical experiments exploring the impact of changing the enzyme concentration on the dynamics of the reaction. Specifically, we report high-resolution phase diagrams predicting and describing how the reaction unfolds over a quite extended range of enzyme concentrations. Surprisingly, such diagrams reveal that the enzyme concentration has a huge impact on the reaction evolution. The highly intricate dynamical behaviours predicted here are difficult to establish theoretically due to the total absence of an adequate framework to solve nonlinearly coupled differential equations. But such behaviours may be validated experimentally.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000612961700016	33463636

La2-xSrxNiO4+delta (0 <= x <= 0.5) ceramics were prepared by the general solid-state reaction process and sintered in different ambient of argon, air or oxygen, respectively. An increase in the amount of Sr decreased delta in La2-xSrxNiO4+delta, while the Ni2+/Ni3+ ratio analyzed by Ni3p XPS decreased indicating that the oxidation state of Ni increased. Particularly when the sample was sintered in a low oxygen partial pressure condition such as in Ar ambient, the hole concentration strongly depended on the Sr content, suggesting that the hole generation seems mostly originated from Sr2+ substitution into the La3+ site.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1229-7801	2234-0491		WOS:000529532200004

The yield of reaction products is stoichiometric (>99.5%): 41A(+) + 40H(-) -> O-2 + 2H(2)O + 41A. By contrast, the structurally homologous cubium Co4O4(trans-OAc)(2)(bpy)(4)(ClO4)(3), 1B(ClO4)(3), produces no O-2. EPR/NMR spectroscopies show clean conversion to cubane 1A during O-2 evolution with no Co2+ or Co3O4 side products. Mass spectrometry of the reaction between isotopically labeled mu-O-16(bridging-oxo) 1A(+) and O-18-bicarbonate/water shows (1) no exchange of O-18 into the bridging oxos of 1A(+), and (2) O-36(2) is the major product, thus requiring two OH- in the reactive intermediate. DFT calculations of solvated intermediates suggest that addition of two OH- to 1A(+) via OH- insertion into Co-OAc bonds is energetically favored, followed by outer-sphere oxidation to intermediate [1A(OH)(2)](0). The absence of O-2 production by cubium IB3+ indicates the reactive intermediate derived from 1A(+) requires gem-1,1-dihydoxo stereochemistry to perform O-O bond formation. Outer-sphere oxidation of this intermediate by 2 equiv of 1A(+) accounts for the final stoichiometry. Collectively, these results and recent literature (Faraday Discuss., doi:10.1039/C5FD00076A and J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2015, 137, 12865-12872) validate the [Co4O4](4+/5+) cubane core as an intrinsic catalyst for oxidation of hydroxide by an inner-sphere mechanism.									55	0	0	0	10	1	55			0002-7863			WOS:000366874700028	26593692

Once it has been assumed that an irreversible gas-liquid reaction is developed between ozone and the matter present in the water, the film theory concept was applied to this system for kinetic determinations. The evolution of the organic and inorganic matter with ozonation time has been followed by the chemical oxygen demand. The procedure allows the determination of the rate coefficients of ozone with the wastewaters treated. According to the results obtained, ozone is consumed through fast reactions which take place near the water-gas interface during an initial period. This period is used to determine the rate coefficients. Then, at more advanced ozonation times, the reactions become slower and hence they take place in the bulk of the water, particularly for the case of tomato wastewaters. Values of the rate coefficient allow us to establish both the kinetic regime of absorption and to compare the reactivity of ozone with the wastewaters and single compounds.									14	0	0	0	13	0	15			0191-9512			WOS:A1992JK92300003

Understanding the cationic-anionic redox accompanying the structural evolution process is really imperative to further improve the performance. In this work, the cationic-anionic redox and capacity degradation mechanism of carbon-coated LMTO during (dis)charge processes are elucidated by combining in situ X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy, and electrochemical analyses. It is concluded that the redox reaction of Mn2+/Mn4+ is quite stable, while the severe degradation is mainly caused by the O2-/O-2(n-) redox process. Moreover, we clearly clarify how the cationic-anionic interplay governs sluggish kinetics, large polarization, and capacity fading in LMTO, and reveal for the first time that a certain amount of carbon coating is capable of suppressing the irreversible lattice oxygen loss and results in an encouraging cycling performance. In summary, we elucidate the degradation of cationicanionic redox processes in cation-disordered cathode materials and propose strategies for adjusting the electronic/ionic conductivity of the electrodes to modulate the oxygen redox reactions, setting a new direction for the design of better cation-disordered oxides.									16	2	0	0	0	0	17			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000502689000032	31714058

We report the evolution of the structure and chemical composition of size-selected micellar Pt nanoparticles (similar to 1 nm) supported on nanocrystalline gamma-Al2O3 during the catalytic oxidation of 2-propanol using X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy. Platinum oxides were found to be the active species for the partial oxidation of 2-propanol (< 140 degrees C), while the complete oxidation (> 140 degrees C) is initially catalyzed by oxygen-covered metallic Pt nanoparticles, which were found to regrow a thin surface oxide layer above 200 degrees C. The intermediate reaction regime, where the partial and complete oxidation pathways coexist, is characterized by the decomposition of the Pt oxide species due to the production of reducing intermediates and the blocking of O-2 adsorption sites on the nanoparticle surface. The high catalytic activity and low onset reaction temperature displayed by our small Pt particles for the oxidation of 2-propanol is attributed to the large amount of edge and corner sites available, which facilitate the formation of reactive surface oxides. Our findings highlight the decisive role of the nanoparticle structure and chemical state in oxidation catalytic reactions.									43	1	0	0	2	0	43			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000290363400041	21469709

The photocatalytic systems of H_2 and O_2 evolutions are very complex and involve a series of issues in science and technology for obtaining the efficient photocatalytic systems of H_2 and O_2 evolutions, among which the selection of co-catalyst is a crucial one. This paper focuses on the progresses of the co-catalysts of photocatalytic H_2 and O_2 evolutions, analyzes and introduces the roles of cocatalysts integrating with the principle of photocatalysis. The roles of the cocatalyst as the active sites for H_2 and 0_2 evolutions include the catalysis in the reactions of H_2 and O_2 evolutions, the reduction of overpotentials and the efficient separation of photo-induced electrons and holes. This paper also introduces the idea of the development of cocatalyts in the photocatalytic systems in the future. It is believed that the efficient combination of dual and multiplex cocatalysts, and the exploration of the non-noble metal cocatalyst are the direction of development in the future.			利用太阳能半导体光催化制氢和制氧,是解决化石能源短缺和环境污染问题的有效途径之一。光催化制氢和制氧体系非常复杂,助催化剂是影响催化效率的一个关键因素。本文综述了光催化产氢助催化剂、光催化产氧助催化剂、光催化产氢和产氧双助催化剂的研究进展。结合光催化原理,介绍了助催化剂的作用,即:作为产氢和产氧的活性位时,催化产氢和产氧反应、降低过电位、促进光生电子和空穴的有效分离等。并对光催化体系中助催化剂的发展提出设想,认为采用二元和多元助催化剂结合的策略,和采用非贵金属型助催化剂的策略将是未来的发展方向。						1	2	0	0	0	0	2			1000-7857			CSCD:4959087

In this Communication, Fe-MOF nanobelts were synthesized by a solvothermal method with Fe2+ as the metal source and could not be obtained by using Fe3+ as the metal source. The final result shows that Fe2+ played a transitional role in the process of achieving belt-shaped and cubelike structural changes.

Herein, gold nanoparticles (NPs) of ca. 2.0 nm are dispersed on Co3O4 support in the shape of nanocubes (dominant Co3O4(001) facet) and nanoplates (Co3O4(111)), which forms different Au-Co3O4 interfaces with respect to the specific facet of the oxide support. A comparison is made on the basis of the interfacial structures and catalytic behavior of ethylene glycol oxidation. STEM analysis identifies that these metallic Au NPs interact with Co3O4 with an orientation relationship of Au/Co3O4(001) and Au/Co3O4(111). XPS and Raman spectroscopy investigations reveal the important variations in the reactivity of surface oxygen, surface O-ads/O-L ratio, and evolution of surface oxygen vacancies upon variation of the Co3O4 shape. Au/Co3O4-P exhibits much better catalytic activity than the Au/Co3O4-C counterpart in the aerobic oxidation of ethylene glycol, which is promoted by surface oxygen vacancies and intrinsic defects. It has been revealed that the surface oxygen vacancies participate in activating O-2, thus making Co3O4-P a superior support for Au NPs in the catalysis of ethylene glycol oxidation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2516-0230			WOS:000631639800022	36132573

Here, we report cobalt-iron subnanoclusters (CoFe-PPy) incorporated on nitrogen-rich nanotubular carbon from dual cross-linked polypyrrole hydrogels. The bimetallic catalyst exhibits obviously improved oxygen electrocatalysis largely attributed to the electronic interaction between cobalt and iron at the atomic scale. Furthermore, the site information and catalytic kinetics of CoFe-PPy were in situ quantified by a surface-interrogation scanning electro-chemical microscopy (SI-SECM) technique. Consequently, CoFe-PPy not only provides higher active site density but also achieves rapid kinetics to activate O-2, greatly promoting the oxygen electroreduction turnover frequency compared with monometallic catalysts. Our work offers an opportunity to investigate important catalytic parameters of bimetallic electrocatalysis and highlights the heterometallic interaction at the subnanometer scale to promote enhanced electrocatalytic reactivity.									56	0	0	0	1	0	56			2380-8195			WOS:000480672800001

In this paper, the evolution of numerous discharge parameters such as total pressure, discharge current and sputtered species number densities are studied in argon with oxygen, nitrogen or acetylene admixture. The experiments are compared to the reactive direct current magnetron sputtering where the deposition process usually exhibits hysteresis behavior and the ionization fraction of sputtered species is significantly lower. The decrease in the titanium atom and ion number densities with the increasing degree of target poisoning is detected for all the studied admixtures. However, while the sputtered species number densities decrease the sputtered species ionization fraction increases. Depending on the reactive gas admixture, the ionization fraction of the sputtered species increases from 75% achieved in pure argon discharge up to 90% attained in the poisoned mode of the reactive sputtering. This increase was the most pronounced for oxygen and nitrogen admixtures. Mutual comparison of the reactive sputtering with nitrogen, oxygen and acetylene indicated multiple causes for the observed increase.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0963-0252	1361-6595		WOS:000460060600001

Oxidative conversion of the GC surface to C-OH, C=O and COO- is observed during potential cycling between the hydrogen and oxygen evolution. The extrapolation of the intensity of the bending vibration signal due to adsorbed water allowed the determination of the point of zero charge (pzc). The pzc of GC is more than 1 V more negative than that of gold in the presence of MEP-Br or MEM-Br. Above the pzc, up to the bromide oxidation potential, MEM+ shows a much stronger chemical affinity to GC than MEP+ because the MEM morpholinium bridge oxygen shows a stronger interaction with the oxidised carbon surface species than the pure CH-structure of the pyrrolidinium species. This study suggests that the battery charging reaction involves mainly a heterogeneous electron transfer from Br- followed by a homogeneous chemical reaction leading to MEP-polybromide, whereas the conversion of specifically adsorbed MEM-Br ion pairs to polybromide is a slow process.

This active hybrid catalyst is synthesized by a facile surfactant-assisted method to produce Co3O4 NC that are then decorated on the surface of N-CNT through hydrophobic attraction. Confirmed by half-cell testing, Co3O4 NC/N-CNT demonstrates superior oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution catalytic activities and has a superior electrochemical stability compared to Pt/C and Ir/C. Furthermore, rechargeable zinc-air battery testing of Co3O4 NC/N-CNT reveals superior galvanodynamic charge and discharge voltages with a significantly extended cycle life of over 100 h, which suggests its potential as a replacement for precious-metal-based catalysts for electric vehicles and grid energy storage applications.									51	1	0	0	4	0	51			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000362729300017	26373363

The Ir-O bond length change in IrO6 coordination induces lattice strain. Increasing the annealing temperature results in a stretching strain along the c axis and a compressive strain on the a and b axes, leading to a larger c/a ratio. Enhancing the lattice strain decreases the c/a ratio, which is beneficial for improving OER activity.									45	1	0	0	4	0	45			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000423464900032	29322156

John William's Broadleaf) exhibit a substantial oxygen uptake upon illumination with one or more short saturating light flashes. This uptake was detected and analyzed by means of mass spectrometry as O-18(2)-gas exchange following the addition of 5 ml O-18(2) to the gas phase over the buffered reaction assay. Along with the light-induced oxygen uptake we measured photosynthetic water oxidation as oxygen evolution at m/e = 32. The oxygen uptake of O-18(2) measured at m/e = 36 can be completely inhibited by various electron accepters and by silicomolybdate in particular. The same fields true for PS II-inhibitors like DBMIB. The effects of DCMU and of different light qualities (blue, red and far-red) on the light-induced oxygen uptake are discussed. We conclude from our results that the chlororespiratory activity within the thylakoid membranes is responsible for the observed oxygen uptake and that the plastoquinone pool is the component shared between both, photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport chains.									21	0	0	0	19	0	21			0005-2728			WOS:A1994QG26500018

It is proposed that the key event in the evolution of PSII was a mutation that resulted in the separation of the two pigments that made up the special chlorophyll pair, making them into two chlorophylls that were neither special nor paired. These ordinary chlorophylls, along with the two adjacent monomeric chlorophylls, were very oxidizing: a property proposed to be intrinsic to monomeric chlorophylls in the environment provided by reaction centre (RC) proteins. It seems likely that other (mainly electrostatic) changes in the environments of the pigments probably tuned their redox potentials further but these changes would have been minor compared with the redox jump imposed by splitting of the special pair. This sudden increase in redox potential allowed the development of oxygen evolution. The highly oxidizing homodimeric RC would probably have been not only inefficient in terms of photochemistry and charge storage but also wasteful in terms of protein or pigments undergoing damage due to the oxidative chemistry. These problems would have constituted selective pressures in favour of the lop-sided, heterodimeric system that exists as PSII today, in which the highly oxidized species are limited to only one side of the heterodimer: the sacrificial, rapidly turned-over D1 protein. It is also suggested that one reason for maintaining an oxidizable tyrosine, TyrD, on the D2 side of the RC, is that the proton associated with its tyrosyl radical, has an electrostatic role in confining P+ to the expendable D1 side.

This catalyst can efficiently reduce the Ir usage from 85 to 34%. Also, the onset potential of cry-Ir is about 1.40 V and the over potential is about 0.34 V at 10 mA cm(-2), indicating that cry-Ir has an excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity to produce oxidizing species and can decrease electrolytic voltage during the electro-oxidation process. So, the electrical efficiency per log order (EE/O) for cry-Ir electrode is only 5% of PbO2 electrode, which is the best electrode for organic degradation. Also, cry-Ir has large tunnel size which favors insertion of aspirin molecule into cry-Ir structure and enhances the contact between reactive intermediates and the contaminant. Using cry-Ir as anode, 100% aspirin removal and 55% chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal could be obtained at 4 V. We also compare cry-Ir electrode with IrO2 and find that IrO2 anode can only eliminate 20% aspirin under the same condition. As a result, cry-Ir is a promising anode material for organic pollutant degradation.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			0944-1344	1614-7499		WOS:000416332100035	28936577

Structural and morphological characterizations revealed the successful preparation of O-doped g-C3N4 with a layered spongy-like micro-nanostructure, which favored the enhancement of O-2 adsorption and active sites. The UV-vis spectra and Mott-Schottky analysis indicated that the introduction of oxygen leaded to a narrow bandgap, a negative shift of valance band maximum and an increased electrical conductivity. As a result, the O-doped g-C3N4 exhibited a higher mass activity (14.9 mA/mg(catalyst) at -0.60 V and 1800 rpm) and 60 mV positive shift of half-wave potential toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as well as a better electron transfer efficiency than did the g-C3N4 without oxygen doping. In order to further increase the ORR activity, Ketjen black carbon was incorporated into the O-doped g-C3N4 catalyst to promote the electron transfer. The resulting catalyst showed a comparable ORR activity (a kinetic-limiting current density of 21.5 mA cm(-2) at -0.6 V), excellent stability and remarkable tolerance to methanol as compared with the Pt/C catalyst, indicating its potential application as a non-metal cathode catalyst for the alkaline direct methanol fuel cell.

Contribution of Proton Capture Reactions to the Ascertained Abundance of Fluorine in the Evolved Stars of Globular Cluster M4, M22, 47 Tuc and NGC 6397								JOURNAL OF ASTROPHYSICS AND ASTRONOMY				38	4					63	10.1007/s12036-017-9481-6				NOV 27 2017	2017	The origin of the abundance pattern and also the (anti) correlation present among the elements found in stars of globular clusters (GCs) remains unimproved until date. The proton-capture reactions are presently recognised in concert of the necessary candidates for that sort of observed behaviour in the second generation stars. We tend to propose a reaction network of a nuclear cycle namely carbon-nitrogen-oxygen-fluorine (CNOF) at evolved stellar condition since fluorine (F-19) is one such element which gets plagued by proton capture reactions. The stellar temperature thought about here ranges from 2 x 10(7) to 10 x 10(7) K and there has been an accretion occuring, with material density being 10(2) g/cm(3) and 10(3) g/cm(3). Such kind of temperature density conditions are probably going to be prevailing within the H-burning shell of evolved stars. The estimated abundances of 19F are then matched with the info that has been determined for a few some metal-poor giants of GC M4, M22, 47 Tuc as well as NGC 6397. As far as the comparison between the observed and calculated abundances is concerned, it is found that the abundance of 19F have shown an excellent agreement with the observed abundances with a correlation coefficent above 0.9, supporting the incidence of that nuclear cycle at the adopted temperature density conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0250-6335	0973-7758		WOS:000417985200001		
J	Zhao, Shanhui; Luo, Yonghao; Zhang, Yunliang; Long, Yufeng								Experimental Investigation of Rice Straw and Model Compound Oxidative Pyrolysis by in Situ Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform and Coupled Thermogravimetry-Differential Scanning Calorimetry/Mass Spectrometry Method								ENERGY & FUELS				29	7			4361	4372		10.1021/acs.energyfuels.5b00583				JUL 2015	2015	The oxidative pyrolysis properties of cellulose, xylan, lignin, and rice straw were studied by thermogravimetric analysis-differential scanning calorimetry (TGA-DSC) coupled with mass spectrometry. The mass loss, reaction heat, and volatile release properties were analyzed to reveal the role of oxygen in the biomass thermal degradation process. Differential thermogravimetry (DTG) results show that the primary mass loss peak was brought forward with the increase of the oxygen concentration for all samples as well as the peak value. Oxygen improved the degradation rate of lignocellulose. The oxidative pyrolysis processes of all four types of material were accompanied by energy consumption or release, generally divided into three stages: moisture release stage, primary pyrolysis stage, and char evolution or oxidation stage. The primary degradation of cellulose under inert and 1% O-2 atmospheres was distinctly endothermic. With the increase of the oxygen concentration, the endothermic peak decreased, while an exothermic peak dominated the oxidative process. Xylan and lignin showed an exothermic primary degradation peak even under an inert atmosphere at the primary pyrolysis stage, and with the increase of the oxygen concentration, the reaction heat released at the primary and char oxidation stage increased. Rice straw showed weak endothermic properties in the primary stage. Volatile compound analysis of oxidative pyrolysis indicated that oxygen promoted the yields of water and permanent gas compounds, such as CO2, CO, and CH4. The yield of condensable compounds, such as benzene, reached a maximum at a mediate oxygen concentration, and too much oxygen would lead to being combusted out completely. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra of three model compounds and rice straw under inert and oxidative atmospheres indicated that oxygen played a less important role at a low-temperature stage, especially for cellulose, which was kind of a uniform structure with less active function groups. Heterogenous oxidation at a relatively high temperature (>400 degrees C) would lead to the degradation of some weak bonds and benefited the formation of an aromatic ring.					2nd International Conference Biogas Science2nd International Conference Biogas Science	20142014		Vienna, AUSTRIAVienna, AUSTRIA	14	0	0	0	3	0	14			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000360026900040

Under visible-light irradiation, the photocatalytic activity for water splitting H-2 evolution over Nd2InNbO7 was higher than that over Nd2Zr2O7. The higher photocatalytic activity of Nd2InNbO7 was ascribed to its conduction band nature, and the higher level of lattice distortion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1842-6573			WOS:000292891400036

The self-assembled Ni-based cyano-bridged coordination polymer flakes (Ni-CP) and graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets with a layered morphology (Ni-CP/GO) are used as precursors for the synthesis of multicomponent hybrid materials. Annealing of Ni-CP/GO in nitrogen at 450 degrees C allows the formation of Ni3C/rGO nanocomposites. Grinding Ni-CP/GO and thiourea and annealing under the same conditions produces N,S-codoped reduced GO-wrapped NiS2 flakes (NiS2/NS-rGO). Interestingly, further heating up to 550 degrees C allows the phase transformation of NiS2 into NiS accompanied by the formation of a face-centered cubic (FCC-Ni) metal phase between NS-rGO layers (FCC-Ni-NiS/NS-rGO). Among all the materials, the resulting FCC-Ni-NiS/NS-rGO exhibits good electrocatalytic activity and stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) owing to the synergistic effect of multiphases, the well-designed alternating layered structures on the nanoscale with abundant active sites.									8	1	0	0	1	0	8			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000531665900001	32133787

Their electrocatalytic activity in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was evaluated and the active state formation was tracked by operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Our studies demonstrate that the cobalt-rich wustite (Cox/3Fe(1-x)/3)O nanoparticles underwent a phase-transformation into the spinels CoxFe3-xO4 (x >= 2) under the applied OER conditions. The overpotential eta(10) at 10 mA cm(-2), serving as a benchmark for the OER activity of the cobalt ferrite nanoparticles in alkaline media, was lower than that of magnetite Fe3O4 even with low cobalt concentrations, reaching a minimum of 350 mV for Co2.25Fe0.75O4 with a Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1). Finally, we identified that the catalytic activity is linked to the nanoparticle size as well as to the degree of Co redox activity and change in coordination during OER.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000709945400001

The structural features of catalyst are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The ORR activity of catalysts is investigated via cyclic voltammetry (CV), rotating disk electrode (RDE), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and chronoamperometry techniques. Comparative CV analysis reveals higher electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of Pd-Ni/rGO catalyst. This result suggests a general approach of a synergistic effect between Pd and Ni nanoparticles and better Pd-Ni dispersion on graphene sheets. The results from ORR measurements show that Pd-Ni/rGO has remarkable electrocatalytic activity and stability compared to Pd/C. The Koutecky-Levich and Tafel analysis suggest that the proposed main path in the ORR mechanism is direct four-electron transfer process with faster transfer kinetic rate on the Pd-Ni/rGO.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1536-383X	1536-4046		WOS:000453424200008

The charge transfer coefficient (CTC) for reactions at the solid-liquid interface is shown to be linearly proportional to the electrochemical potential change from the initial state to the transition state as well the interface differential capacitance at the constant-charge model, and can be further related to the net dipole change normal to the surface during the reaction. Using the constant-charge theory, the CTC can be explicitly calculated on the basis of the first principles calculations without the need to assume the redox behavior of the elementary reactions and thus provide a unique possibility to evaluate and compare the magnitude of CTC for different reactions across different surfaces. By examining a series of interface reactions and comparing the calculated CTC values, we propose simple rules to understand and predict the charge transfer coefficient of three classes of the interface elementary reactions. The role of surface dipole, solvation, and molecular adsorption strength on the CTC can now be clarified from first principles calculations.									18	0	0	0	2	0	18			1932-7447			WOS:000331861700029

VOH* dissociates with a rate of 2 x 10(-5) s(-1) at 195 degrees C, causing VO to recover after long duration (> 10(4) min), while a similar evolution occurs at 300 degrees C on a time scale of the order of 10 min. The diffusivity of the monatomic hydrogen used in the model agrees closely with the established values for the diffusivity of protons. After the recovery of VO, further annealing at higher temperatures and/or longer durations transforms VO into the "ordinary" vacancy-oxygen-hydrogen center with an energy level at E-c -0.32 eV (V OH). VOH is subsequently transformed into VOH2. For temperatures above 250 degrees C, two additional hydrogen-related levels occur (similar to 0.17 and similar to 0.58 eV below E-c) with a one-to-one ratio and a possible association with different charge states of a V2OH center is discussed.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1098-0121			WOS:000300661500003

Developing novel anode materials with high OER activity and stability is imperative. Herein, we propose a novel Pb-ceramic composite anode by introducing ZnFe2O4. In this work, Pb-ZnFe2O4 and PS-Pb anodes were prepared through powder pressing and sintering processes. The effects of ZnFe2O4 particles on the phase composition, surface morphology and inner structure of the oxide layer formed on Pb-ZnFe2O4 anodes were investigated. Furthermore, the role of ZnFe2O4 in the anodic potential and stability of Pb-ZnFe2O4 anodes was discussed. The results show that as the ZnFe2O4 content increases, the oxide layer formed on Pb-ZnFe2O4 anodes exhibits higher surficial compactness, higher integrity, and much smaller thickness. ZnFe2O4 exhibits a trivial impact on the oxygen evolution dynamics. However, the anodic potential of the Pb-ZnFe2O4 anode declines as the ZnFe2O4 content increases, which could be attributed to the higher compactness and smaller thickness of the oxide layer. As the ZnFe2O4 content increases, the weight loss of the Pb-ZnFe2O4 composite anode increases, suggesting the unsatisfactory stability of Pb-ZnFe2O4, which could be attributed to the inevitable dissolution of ZnFe2O4 particles, smaller thickness of the oxide layer and larger porosity of the substrate. Although Pb-ZnFe2O4 composite anodes have the potential to reduce energy consumption, their unsatisfactory stability limits the feasibility of Pb-ZnFe2O4 anodes in the electrowinning industry.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0304-386X	1879-1158		WOS:000637219900025

Here we demonstrate monolithic heteronanomat (MH) paper air cathodes as a new electrode platform to enable the fabrication of origami-foldable zinc (Zn)-air batteries with reliable electrochemical rechargeability. The MH paper air cathodes consist of one-dimensional (1D) bifunctional catalyst mixtures (NdBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+delta double perovskite (NBSCF) nanofibers for the oxygen evolution reaction and nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) for the oxygen reduction reaction), cellulose nanofibers (CNFs), and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) nanoparticles, without the incorporation of conventional current collectors and gas diffusion layers. The CNFs and PTFE nanoparticles act as hydrophilic and hydrophobic binders, respectively, to construct three-dimensional (3D) bicontinuous electrolyte/air channels in the MH paper air cathodes. The well-developed electrolyte/air transport pathways, in combination with the rational design of the 1D bifunctional catalyst mixtures, enables the resultant Zn-air batteries (MH paper air cathode vertical bar CNF separator membrane vertical bar Zn-foil anode) to exhibit highly efficient charge/discharge performance and cyclability. In addition, the highly entangled network structure (based on a fibrous mixture of NBSCFs, N-CNTs, and CNFs) of the MH paper air cathode substantially improves its mechanical flexibility under various deformation modes, enabling the resultant Zn-air battery to be folded into a paper-airplane shape via origami folding.									20	3	0	0	0	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000494830400055

Interestingly, the GO@Ni has anti-corrosion property in an acidic electrolyte and high catalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Ni metal is easily corroded in the acid solution and cannot be used as an electrocatalyst in electrolysers for hydrogen generation. On the other hand, the GO@Ni with oxygen-containing functional groups exhibits a high HER catalytic activity with an overpotential of 83.2 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). It can also be continuously tested under 1.0 M H2SO4 for 30 h without a corrosion issue of Ni substrate. In addition, the change in the morphological and structural properties of the GO@Ni after testing in H2SO4 was investigated by microscopy and spectroscopy techniques. The rate of hydrogen evolution was found to be in the order of 10(-7) mol cm(-2)s(-1) as measured by an in situ electrochemical gas chromatography (GC). The GO@Ni electrode could be an alternative electrocatalyst in the electrolysers towards HER under acidic environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The ceramic powders were prepared from TiCl4 by complexation of Ti ions and successive decomposition of the complex to form an amorphous oxide. A high temperature reduction (1050,C) of the amorphous oxide was carried out by using diluted hydrogen. IrO2 electrocatalysts supported on Ti-suboxides were prepared by incipient wetness. The chemistry, morphology and structure of the materials were studied by TPR, XRF, XPS, BET, TEM and XRD. The electrochemical activity for oxygen evolution in a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) electrolyser of IrO2 catalysts supported on a commercial titanium suboxide (Ebonex (R)) and Ti(n)O2(n-1) prepared in-house was investigated by ac-impedance spectroscopy, linear sweep and cyclic voltammetry. The results showed proper electronic conductivity for both electrocatalysts and superior electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst based on the Ti-suboxides prepared in-house compared to the commercial support. In situ cyclic voltammetry and ac-impedance analyses showed larger voltammetric charge and double layer capacitance for the catalyst based on the Ti-suboxides prepared in-house with respect to the catalyst supported on Ebonex (R). These results were attributed to the better dispersion and larger occurrence of active catalytic sites on the surface of the suboxide prepared in-house based anode compared to the anode based on the commercial support.

Bimetallic metal nanoclusters with precise particle size and structure were used in this study to investigate the effect of electronic and geometric structure on the catalytic reaction. The electron coupling between heteroatom and the host atom could regulate the catalytic performance. To create the well-dispersed electrochemical catalysts, carbon nanosheets supported Au4Pd2 nanoclusters(NCs)with a high surface area. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS)test revealed that the synergistic effect of AuPd and the support could promote ORR and HER stability. The ORR performance of Au4Pd2-CNs-2 with the initial potential of 0.95 V and the half-wave potential of 0.81 V was better than those of commercial Pd/C in the 0.1 mol/L KOH. The catalyst also demonstrated excellent catalytic activity towards HER with the overpotential of 129 mV at 10 mA/cm~2 in 0.5 mol/L H_2SO_4. The structure and morphology of catalysts are determined using X-ray diffraction(XRD)and transmission electron microscopy(TEM), and electrochemical measurements are used to test the electrocatalytic performances. Ultra-small single-cluster catalysts could improve the utilization and electrocatalytic activity of atoms, and the synergy effects between Au and Pd also enhance the catalytic activity of catalysts. By optimizing the doping ratio of Au4Pd2 NCs, bifunctional catalysts with excellent oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution performance were obtained, providing a new direction for developing non-platinum-based catalysts with high efficiency and stability.			贵金属纳米团簇由于精确的结构和明确的化学组成而受到广泛的关注。该工作采用具有精准的颗粒大小和精确的结构双金属金属纳米团簇,研究其电子结构、几何结构对催化反应的影响,同时利用杂原子与主原子间的强电子耦合作用调控催化性能。首先制备4个金原子与2个钯原子组成的金钯纳米团簇,并分散至二维材料上得到单团簇分散的金钯基纳米复合材料催化剂;通过XPS测试可知,AuPd与载体之间存在较强的协同作用,有助于促进其氧还原(ORR)与析氢反应(HER)的稳定性;调节贵金属比例得到最佳比例的金钯催化剂,在0.1 mol/L KOH氧饱和电解液中,起始电位为0.95 V,半波电位为0.81 V,其ORR性能优于商业Pd/C。该催化剂也具有良好的HER性能,在0.5 mol/L H_2SO_4电解液中,电流密度为10 mA/cm~2下的过电位为129 mV;利用X射线衍射(XRD)、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)、透射电镜(TEM)对催化剂结构进行表征分析,解释其结构与性能间的联系。优化贵金属团簇掺杂比例得到具有优异氧还原与析氢性能的双功能催化剂,为高效稳定的电催化剂的开发提供了新方向。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-4239			CSCD:7147760

In addition to these improvements, we extended the in situ cation exchange strategy to 2D MOF nanosheet assembles and 3D MOF polyhedra, which combine perfectly with PBA nanocubes to form new MOF@PBA architectures. The obtained MOF@PBA architectures exhibit an efficient catalytic oxygen evolution ability under strongly alkaline conditions. Therefore, the synthesis strategy of this study opens up a new way to construct other modified hybrid materials and has broad application prospects.									53	3	0	0	4	0	53			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000476913600007

Metal tellurides are synthesized by tellurization process performed basically at high temperature in reducing gas atmosphere, which makes the process expensive and complicated. The development of a facile and economical process for desirable metal telluride nanostructures without complicated manipulation is still a challenge. In an effort to develop an alternative strategy of tellurization, herein we report a thin film formation of self-standing cobalt telluride nanotubes on various conducting and nonconducting substrates using a simple binder-free synthetic strategy based on anion exchange transformation from a thin film of cobalt hydroxycarbonate nanostructures in aqueous solution at room temperature. The nanostructured films before and after ion exchange transformation reaction are characterized using field emission scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray analyzer, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thin film X-ray diffraction technique, high resolution transmission electron microscope, and selected area electron diffraction analysis technique. After the ion exchange transformation of nanostructures, the film shows conversion from insulator to highly electrical conductive semimetallic characteristic. When used as a counter electrode in I3(-)/I(-) redox electrolyte based dye-sensitized solar cells, the telluride film exhibits an electrocatalytic reduction activity for I3(-) with a demonstration of solar-light to electrical power conversion efficiency of 8.10%, which is highly competitive to the efficiency of 8.20% exhibited by a benchmarked Pt-film counter electrode. On the other hand, the telluride film electrode also demonstrates electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction from oxidation of water.									57	1	0	0	3	0	57			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000366005600045	26524092

Therefore, it is of great significance to develop OER electrocatalysts with high activity, long durability, and scalability. Herein, we present a selenium-coated cobalt selenide (CoSe2@Se) catalyst that was first synthesized by in-situ growth on carbon cloth (CC) surface by hydrothermal method, followed by soaking treatment to prepare a three-dimensional coral-like Fe2O3-CoSe2@Se/CC composite. Electrochemical studies revealed that the optimized Fe2O3-CoSe2@Se/CC catalyst only requires 250 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) current density, yields a small Tafel slope (50.2 mV dec(-1)), and has good stability (10 mA cm(-2)@70 h) in the electrocatalytic OER process. The overall water splitting using Fe2O3-CoSe2@Se/CC as anode only requires 1.58 and 1.69 V to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm-2, respectively, much better than most previously reported catalysts. Analysis showed that the three-dimensional coral-like morphology exposing more active sites and the synergy between different species (giving rise to, inter alia, a favorable electronic structure that lowers the electrode overpotential) are the key to the observed improved electrocatalytic performance. This work provides a novel strategy for the rational design of nanostructured OER hybrid catalysts in the future.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000737153700006

Herein, a porous ultrathin 2D CN@graphene@CN sandwich structure (5GO-CN) was prepared through in-situ local thermal oxygen erosion strategy. The inner graphene substantially accelerates the migration and separation of photogenerated charge carriers. Moreover, a small amount of oxygen-containing groups in inner graphene layer can effectively fix the thin layer of carbon nitride in the two outer surface layers. With the help of porous structure, spatially separated redox site, excellent visible light capture and fast separation of photoinduced charge carriers, this optimal 5GO-CN composite exhibited 14.3 times higher photocatalytic H-2 production rate (5.58 mmol g(-1) h(-1)) than bulk CN. The composition, microstructure and optical property of 5GO-CN sample were thoroughly investigated. This new strategy furnishes an effective way to modify other functional catalysts via using nanostructure design.									19	3	0	0	1	0	20			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000609010200005

Water electrolysis toward hydrogen formation is a remarkable method for energy storage. However, oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) through water-oxidation reaction is a bottleneck in water-splitting systems. Different Ni-based molecular structures have been claimed to be OER catalysts. However, the impact of Ni (hydr)oxides formed by the degradation of Ni-based molecular structures on OER is a challenging issue. The effect of electrolyte impurity on OER in the presence of metal coordination compounds is rarely investigated. In this study, live important questions are considered regarding OER in the presence of a Ni coordination compound: (i) In which potential does the coordination compound start to be decomposed? (ii) After how many CVs does the decomposition occur? (iii) What is the effect of Fe impurity on OER in the presence of the Ni coordination compound? (iv) What is the product of the decomposition of the Ni coordination compound? (v) What is the true catalyst for OER in the presence of the Ni coordination compound? The roles of both the Fe impurity in the electrolyte and the Ni (hydr)oxide formed in the presence of a Ni coordination compound are investigated. The experiments showed that in the presence of the Ni coordination compound, Ni (hydr)oxide and Fe impurity in KOH formed a Ni-Fe oxide-based catalyst during OER, which is an efficient catalyst for OER Fe impurity is a key contributor to observing OER in the presence of this Ni coordination compound.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000813445300001

Herein, an innovative 0D-1D-2D hierarchical structure material (denoted as FeCoNi-N-rGO) is developed by a facile two-step synthesis strategy to construct N-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon nanospheres (CNSs) for encapsulating ternary Fe/Co/Ni alloy nanoparticles on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Specifically, abundant Fe/Co/Ni alloy nanoparticles and M-N-C active sites generated by transition metals (Co, Ni, Fe) coupling with N-doped carbon (CNTs, CNSs, and rGO) can provide the FeCoNi-N-rGO with superior OER and ORR properties; meanwhile, the hierarchical structure endows large specific surface area to expose more active sites and to facilitate mass transfer. Typically, the FeCoNi-N-rGO exhibits a high ORR half-wave potential of 0.836 V and a low OER overpotential of 440 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH. Moreover, the FeCoNi-N-rGO-based rechargeable Zn-air battery can deliver a high peak power density (152.5 mW cm(-2)), specific capacity (766 mAh g(-1)) and excellent stability (more than 200 h), surpassing commercial Pt/C-RuO2 catalysts. Therefore, this work will offer an easy fabrication strategy to design bifunctional catalysts with desirable performances for Zn-air batteries. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

For this purpose, Mn-Co nanofilm is electrochemically synthesised in a one-step process on nickel foam in the presence of metal nitrates without any additives. The possible mechanism of the synthesis is proposed. The morphology and structure of the catalysts are studied by various techniques including scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The analyses show that the as-deposited catalysts consist mainly of oxides/hydroxides and/or (oxy)hydroxides based on Mn2+, Co2+, and Co3+. The alkaline post-treatment of the film results in the formation of Mn-Co (oxy)hydroxides and crystalline Co(OH)(2) with a beta-phase hexagonal platelet-like shape structure, indicating a layered double hydroxide structure, desirable for the OER. Electrochemical studies show that the catalytic performance of Mn-Co was dependent on the concentration of Mn versus Co in the synthesis solution and on the deposition charge. The optimised Mn-Co/Ni foam is characterised by a specific surface area of 10.5 m(2)g(-1), a pore volume of 0.0042 cm(3)g(1), and high electrochemical stability with an overpotential deviation around 330-340 mV at 10 mAcm(geo)(-2) for 70 h.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				1996-1944		WOS:000551495800238	32545248

Characterisation by SEM has shown that they consisted of micro-dendrites separated by pores with a typical diameter of 1 mum. In addition, circular hollows (10-100 mum in diameter) were found on the deposit surface; their density varied with the deposition current density and deposition charge. The surface roughness of the Ni deposits, measured by EIS, was found to increase roughly linearly with the deposition charge, and to be little dependent on current density, provided a threshold value was exceeded. The oxygen evolution reaction has been studied on these electrodes by simultaneous real-time measurements of potential and electrolyte resistance fluctuations. The analysis of the electrochemical noise indicated that the dimensions of oxygen bubbles detaching from the electrodes slightly increased with the deposit surface roughness. It is not clear, however, whether or not this increase was associated with the effect of the small (1 mum) or the large (10-100 mum) features on the electrode-bubble interactions.									38	0	0	0	1	0	39			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000224096500015

However, high cost and scarcity of noble metals have led to an increased demand of earthabundant metal oxide catalysts, especially for bifunctional activity in ORR and OER. The fact that Pt and Ir or C, the cost-effective alternatives suggested, do not display satisfactory bifunctional activity has also helped in turning the interest to metal oxides which are stable under both ORR and OER conditions. Brownmillerite A(2)B(2)O(5) type oxides are promising as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts because of intrinsic structural features, viz., oxygen vacancy and catalytic activity of the B-site transition metal. In this study, Co-doped Ca2Fe2O5 compounds are synthesized by the solid state method and structurally analyzed by Rietveld refinement of powder X-ray diffraction data. The compound Ca2Fe2O5, crystallizing in the Pcmn space group has alternative FeO4 tetrahedral and FeO6 octahedral layers. Its Co-doped analogue, Ca2Fe1.75Co0.25O5, also crystallizes in the same space group with both tetrahedral and octahedral Fe positions substituted with Co. However, Ca2FeCoO5 in the Pbcm space group shows interlayer ordering with Co-rich octahedra connected to Fe-rich tetrahedra and vice versa. Oxygen bifunctional activities of these catalysts are monitored by rotating disc electrode and rotating ring disc electrode techniques in alkaline media. A close analysis of the ORR and OER was conducted through comparison of various parameters such as onset potential, current density, halfwave potential, and other kinetic parameters, which suggests that the presence of Co in the B site aids in achieving better bifunctional activity and bulk conductivity. In addition, Co(II)/Co(III) redox systems and their comparative concentrations also play a decisive role in enhancing the activity.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2470-1343			WOS:000460214700005	31459309

Compared with the traditional Sb-doPed SnO2 electrode prepared by the sol gel method, the proposed SnO2 electrode has a higher crystallinity, a higher order degree of the atomic lattice, and a lower concentration of oxygen vacancies. The scanning electron microscopy image confirms that the surface of the electrode presents a three-dimensional structure consisting of Sb-dOped SnO2 nanoparticles with a certain microspherical structure, which increases the specific area greatly and provides more active sites. The reaction activation energy also decreases from 11.67 kJ mol(-1) for the traditional SnO2 electrode to 5.73 kJ mol(-1). This SnO2 electrode is demonstrated to have a superior electrochemical oxidation ability for refractory fluorobenzene, which is extremely stable and cannot even be degraded effectively on a boron doped diamond electrode with a strong oxidation capacity. The results also indicate that the distinctive SnO2 electrode has a higher apparent rate constant, total organic carbon removal, and mineralization current efficiency, which are 12, 2.6, and 3.3 times those of the traditional SnO2 electrode, respectively. The evolution of intermediates and the degradation mechanism of fluorobenzene were further discussed. This study provides a distinctive SnO2 anode for the effective electrochemical oxidation of refractory toxic organic pollutants.									69	6	0	0	13	0	73			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000288113400010

Sulfur plays a crucial role in S-doped g-C3N4 not only in increasing the charge density but also in reducing the energy band gap of S-doped g-C3N4 via substitution of nitrogen sites. S-doped g-C3N4 can serve as an oxygen-evolved photocatalyst, when combined with Ru/SrTiO3:Rh in the presence of [Co(bpy)(3)](3+/2+) as an electron mediator, enables photocatalytic overall water splitting under visible light irradiation with hydrogen and oxygen production rates of 24.6 and 14.5 mu mol-h(-1), respectively. Moreover, the photocatalytic overall water splitting to produce H-2 and O-2 using this Z-scheme system could use for five runs to at least 94.5 h under visible light irradiation. On the other hand, S-doped g-C3N4 can reduce biofouling by bacteria such as Escherichia toll by more than 70%, by simply incubating the Sdoped g-C3N4 sample with bacterial solution under light irradiation. Our results suggest that S-doped g-C3N4 is a potentially effective, green, and promising material for a variety of photocatalytic applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, inadequate charge separation and sluggish oxidation kinetics remain a fundamental challenge. This study investigates bifacially interface engineered BiVO4 photoanodes by considering a seed-layer and NiOOH oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) over-layer to regulate the charge carrier transport and improve the overall PEC water-splitting performance. The modification of the BiVO4/FTO interface stimulates electron flow towards fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) and a NiOOH over-layer improves the facile hole transfer from BiVO4 to the electrolyte. Compared to the moderate photocurrent density of a bare BiVO4 photoanode (1.5 mA cm(-2)), the interface-engineered Seed_BiVO4_NiOOH photoanode shows a remarkably high (approximate to 3.4 times higher) photocurrent density of 5.10 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode with impressive long-term stability over 9 h under illumination. The optimally interface engineered Seed_BiVO4_NiOOH photoanode shows an excellent photoconversion efficiency (1.83%), with significant improvement in bulk charge separation efficiency. This work presents a promising strategy for the development of a highly stable PEC water-splitting device and eliminates the intrinsic material shortcomings of the bare BiVO4 photoanode by modulating the carrier transport via bifacial interface engineering.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2366-7486			WOS:000760844200001

In this paper, the cobalt-iron (Co-Fe) composite supported on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (CoFe composite/NCNTs) is synthesized. The intrinsic OER and HER catalytic activities of this CoFe composite/NCNTs composite are significantly improved with palladium (Pd) nanocluster decoration [Pd-coated (CoFe composite/NCNTs)]. The as-prepared Pd-coated (CoFe composite/NCNTs) catalyst exhibits excellent trifunctional electrocatalytic activity and stability due to the interfacial coupling between Pd and (CoFe composite/NCNTs). This catalyst is successfully employed in the water electrolysis cell as both OER and HER electrode catalysts, flexible rechargeable Zn-air battery as the bifunctional ORR and OER electrode catalyst. The cell voltage of this catalyst-coated electrodes requires only 1.60 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) current density for water electrolysis cell, which is comparable to and even better than that of Pt/C and Ir/C based cell. The primary Zn-air battery using this catalyst shows a constant high open-circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.47 V and a maximum power density of 261 mW cm(-2) in the flooded mode configuration. Most importantly, a flexible Zn-air battery with this catalyst runs very smoothly without a change in voltage gap during flat, bending, and twisting positions.

Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) multi-level architecture design is achieved by the confined growth of two-dimensional (2D) layer double hydroxides of nickel and iron (NiFe LDH) flakes on copper nanowires arrays (Cu NWs), which is epitaxially assembled on the surface of Cu foam (CF). The established Cu@Cu NW@LDH possesses stronger bonding strength between NiFe LDH and Cu NWs as well as Cu NWs and CF endowed by electroplating method. The introduction of Cu NWs not only provides abundant nucleation sites for the deposition of NiFe LDH flakes but also improves the electron conductivity of composite. The obtained Cu@Cu NW@LDH shows excellent OER catalytic activity with a potential of 1.44 V at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and strong alkaline resistance properties in comparison with NiFe LDH on CF (Cu@LDH). As expected, the rechargeable zinc-air battery (ZAB) with Cu@Cu NW@LDH as air electrode delivers superior cycling stability (250 h at a current density of 10 mA cm-2). This work paves a new way to the design of 3D multi-level architecture catalysts for ZAB.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000736684600004

Herein, three polyoxovanadate (POV)-based inorganic-organic hybrid compounds with formula of [Ni-2(BBTZ)(H2O)(4)] V4O12 center dot 2H(2)O(1), [Co-2(BBTZ)(H2O)(4)]V4O12 center dot 2H(2)O(2), [Ni(BBTZ)(2)]V2O6 center dot 2H(2)O(3) (BBTZ = 1,4-bis-(1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene) were synthesized as electrocatalysts to explore their roles for OER. Structural analysis showed that compounds 1-2 are isomorphic 2-D wave-like layer structures, while compound 3 features 3-D framework with a 5-fold interpenetrating metal-organic moiety. Experiments showed that the three compounds can keep their structural integrities after soaking in 1 M KOH electrolyte, and compound 1 exhibited the best catalytic activity towards OER with low overpotential of 353 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and small Tafel slope of 77.8 mV dec(-1). However, a series of technical characterizations clearly implied that there are structural con version processes of compounds 1-3 on electrode surface accompanying the electrocatalytic reation. The organic ligands and most of polyoxovanadate species were electrochemically extracted under anodic potential, leaving the V-doping metal oxyhydroxides as OER-active species. This work confirmed that polyoxovanadates are not active sites but precursors for generating active species of OER, and suggested an available route for designing new nanosized vanadium-doped metal oxide electrocatalysts.									12	1	0	0	0	0	13			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000599531700003

However, the strongly correlated behavior which often results in intriguing emergent phenomena in these materials has been mostly overlooked in understanding the electrochemical activities. Here, we demonstrate a close correlation between the phase transitions and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in strongly correlated SrRuO3. By systematically introducing Ru-O vacancies into the single-crystalline SrRuO3 epitaxial thin films, we induced a phase transition in crystalline symmetry which resulted in the corresponding modification of the electronic structure. The modified electronic structure significantly affects the electrochemical activities, so a 30% decrease in the overpotential for the OER activity was achieved. Our study suggests that a substantial enhancement in the OER activity can be realized even within single material systems, by rational design and engineering of their crystal and electronic structures.									56	0	0	0	2	0	56			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000398909900010

This combination leads to a low water activity in the electrolyte, which thus suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction on Mg, as well as producing a stable oxy-hydroxide film which protects the metal surface from freely corroding. The conducting polymer cathode is reduced somewhat during the discharge process, however, appears to be readily re-oxidised (as determined from the resistance) by the oxygen present in the cell. The cell is therefore primarily a Mg/O-2 battery, however, the PEDOT appears to enhance the performance, in particular the discharge voltage. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The overall water-splitting efficiency of this material is higher than that for reported NiCo2S4 nanowire array on CC with just needing a voltage of 1.66 V to afford 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, this material also shows fabulous catalytic activity and selectivity for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with an ultralow potential of 0.249 V vs SCE to obtain 10 mA cm(-2), surpassing all reported transition-metal based UOR catalysts. An urea-assisted energy-saving alkaline hydrogen-production system was further built here by replacing anodic oxygen evolution reaction with UOR. This whole urea electrolysis cell driven by NiCo2S4 NS/CC (+,-) affords 10 mA cm(-2) at a relative low voltage of 1.49 V, which is 210 mV less than that for urea-free counterpart and also comparable to those for other reported catalysts. The amazing catalytic performances should be due to the intrinsic high activity and metallic feature of NiCo2S4 phase, the nanoporous and open-shelled nanosheet topology that exposes more catalytic active sites and accelerates the diffusion of electrolyte and the generated gas bubbles, as well as the spinel structure and mixed valence states of Ni and Co elements in NiCo2S4 phase that offers richer redox reactions.									125	3	0	0	9	0	126			2168-0485			WOS:000429285800066

The film presents fluorine atoms incorporated as -SiF, -SiF2, -SiF3, and [-SiF2-]n groups. The open structure of the film, due to the high fluorine content as [-SiF2-]n, favors the penetration of oxygen and water molecules in the network. The evolution of the film has been explained by the different reactivity of the silicon atoms depending on their chemical environment. The role of fluorine atoms incorporated into the film has been established.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1071-1023			WOS:A1993KN12600013

Herein, we report the successful synthesis of Fe2P nanoparticles encapsulated within heteroatom-doped graphene-like carbons via a simple pyrolysis process starting from a biogenic precursor, which is obtained via microbially mediated iron reduction of polyferric flocs by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. The strong interaction between bacterial proteins and biogenic vivianite in the precursor plays a significant role in preventing agglomeration of Fe2P nanoparticles and facilitating formation of mesoporous hierarchical carbons with large surface area and high conductivity. The size of Fe2P nanoparticles is tunable in a range from 3 to 80 nm by modulating the properties of the bacteria@vivianite precursor. These properties can vary significantly depending on the molar ratio of electron donors to electron acceptors for acclimation. The resulting Fe2P (3 nm)@BC catalyst derived from the bacteria@vivianite precursor at a molar donor/acceptor ratio of 8:1 exhibits substantially improved activity towards electrocatalytic oxygen reduction as compared to the reference carbon samples. The outstanding oxygen reduction performance of this catalyst is also verified in microbial fuel cells.									13	1	0	0	3	0	13			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000482496300028

In this work metallic cobalt nanoparticle decorated graphene aerogel (CoNPs/rGO aerogel) was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal reaction, followed by thermal annealing in reducing H-2 atmosphere. As prepared CoNPs/rGO aerogel demonstrates commercial Pt/C-comparable ORR activity through a predominant four-electron pathway, as well as excellent durability and methanol tolerance superior to Pt/C in alkaline medium. This work suggests that metallic cobalt nanoparticle is highly efficient to boost the ORR activity of neighboring carbon besides various cobalt compounds. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The optimum produced Co/G((opt.)) electrode yields an ethanol oxidation onset potential (Et-E-onset) 1.43 V/RHE and a current density, I at 1.6 V/ RHE = 26.58 mA.cm(-2) at a scan rate of 50 mV.s(-1). Its cyclic voltammetry (CV) and rotating ring-disc (RRDE) responses, in solutions of 0.5 M NaOH without and with 1 M EtOH, show the priority of ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) rather than the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) or transformation of CoOOH to CoO2 in the potential range 1.4 <= E <= 1.8 V/RHE. The RRDE responses are used to distinguish between EOR and OER currents in presence of ethanol. The present study includes sincere efforts to resolve the controversy about the measurement of the ethanol oxidation activity parameters. In addition, Co/G((opt.)) electrode shows remarkable activity and stability for OER in absence of EtOH. Its overpotential required to achieve 10 mA.cm(-2) (eta(t-0)) is 0.38 V; while, after 24 h, (eta(t=24h)) is 0.40 V. These values are a noteworthy outcome for our easy and straightforward fabrication method for such an efficient EOR/OER electrocatalyst expending low-cost materials when compared with the previously published work.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000817831400009

Herein, a facile boriding strategy is developed to directly convert the leachates of waste printed circuit boards into magnetic mixed metal borides (FeNiCuSnBs) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. Via the boriding process, a metal cation recovery rate of 99.78 %, 99.98 %, 99.96 %, and 99.49 % has been attained for Fe, Ni, Cu, and Sn, respectively. The obtained catalysts with a higher ratio of Ni and Fe show better OER performance. The optimal FNCSB-4 attains 10 mA cm-2 at a low overpotential of 199 mV, as well as good stability in alkaline solution. Remarkably, FNCSB-4 represents a record high activity among waste-derived OER electrocatalysts. In-depth study suggests that the superior OER performance is mainly owing to accelerated surface self-reconstruction by B/Sn co-etching under OER potential region, and the newly formed multimetal (oxy)hydroxides act as the active species for OER. Additionally, the efficient mass/charge transfer, the amorphous feature, and hierarchical structure also benefit OER. Apart from providing an insight into the correlation between surface self-reconstruction and OER activity of multimetal boride-based catalysts, this study also offers a general strategy for the high-efficiency recovery and advanced energy-driven applications of critical metals from other urban mines in a sustainable and environment-friendly approach.									8	0	0	0	3	0	8			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000696913200006

To understand the mechanism of the catalytic process, we explored this process by [Fe(cyclam)Cl-2]Cl performing density functional theory-based first-principles calculations. We examined the energetics of the formation of the oxygen-oxygen bond through the investigation of complexes [Fe(cyclam)(OH)(O)]. The process of water nucleophilic addition by this Fe) complexes was explored in detail. Our computational study confirms the formation of these species, which were reported earlier in experimental conditions. The transition states for various reactions of the catalytic cycle were obtained within the implicit water model. From these calculations, we find that the proton transfers to cis-oxo or hydroxide moiety require high activation energy during the formation of the oxygen-oxygen bond. Our calculations reveal that the oxygen-oxygen bond formation by the transfer of a proton to the explicit water molecule requires more activation free energy than the transfer of a proton to the cis-oxo or hydroxide of the Fe-oxo species. Overall [Fe(cyclam)(O)]and [Fe(cyclam)(OH)(O)]>species with one explicit water molecule requires similar free energy. The Mulliken spin density data confirm the formation of the superoxide complexes. The activation free energy for the release of the oxygen molecule is lesser than that of the oxygen-oxygen bond formation. The natural bond orbital analysis for the complexes before and after the formation of the oxygen-oxygen bond formation shows that this bond formation happens through the interaction of antibonding orbital,pi*(dx) of Fe=O moiety, with the sigma*-orbital of the hydroxide group of the water molecule.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1432-881X	1432-2234		WOS:000571875000001

The composite was systematically characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, N-2 adsorption-desorption and UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy techniques. The superior contact between two moieties in the composites facilitates the charge carrier separation and the evolution of oxygen. Under visible light irradiation, the amount of oxygen evolution from the optimized photocatalyst containing ca. 6 wt% RGO reached 437.3 mu mol g(-1), which was 5.1 times as high as that from m-WO3. The enhancement of photocatalytic activity could be ascribed to the fact that RGO acts herein as a solid-state electron mediator, promoting the charge transportation and separation, as well as suppressing the electron-hole recombination in the composite. This study might provide a prototype for constructing a novel photocatalytic system by hybridizing graphene with a mesoporous semiconductor for solar energy conversion.									81	6	0	0	6	0	84			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000326984500039

However, the repeat structural degradation accompanied by the detrimental intermediate of sodium selenides (NaxSe) leads them to suffer from continuous capacity decaying and under-voltage failure. In this work, CoSe2 is chosen as a representative by the introduction of a polar Ti3C2Tx matrix to alleviate the performance deterioration caused by the crystal structure evolution. CoSe2 nanorods are in situ grown on the Ti3C2Tx (CoSe2/Ti3C2Tx) surface by a simple one-step hydrothermal reaction during the reduction environment. A tight chemical bonding is formed between CoSe2 and Ti3C2Tx by oxygen bridging, which maintains the stable charge and ion transport during cycling. Meanwhile, Ti3C2Tx facilitates copper coming from the collector being diffused in the electrode, and is involved in the electrochemical reaction in an ether-based electrolyte, resulting in CoSe2 being partially converted to Cu2-xSe after long cycles. Synchronously, Ti3C2Tx improves the mutual transformation of NaxSe <-> Na2Se during the intercalation/de-intercalation of metal selenides. Therefore, via optimizing the content of Ti3C2Tx, the CoSe2/Ti3C2Tx-10 composite obtains excellent long cycle stability, delivering a specific capacity of 343 mA h g(-1) at 0.3 A g(-1) after 1200 cycles with a capacity retention of 98%. Even at 10.0 A g(-1), CoSe2/Ti3C2Tx-10 exerts about 200 mA h g(-1) initial capacity, and remains at 140 mA h g(-1) after 1400 cycles. The strategy of introducing a polar matrix to improve the long cycling stability of the metal selenide provides a new opportunity for the development of new anode materials for SIBs.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2398-4902			WOS:000717644000001

Herein, we report a spherical carbon decorated with FeP and CoP nanoparticles (denoted as FeCoP/NPC) as an ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalyst for rechargeable Zn-air batteries. HCTCz@Fe/Co-PA is first produced by the modification of phytic acid (PA) onto (into) a porous cross-linked polymeric sphere of poly(bis(N-carbazolyl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine) (HCTCz), followed by chelating with metal ions (i.e., Fe3+ and Co2+). The subsequent pyrolysis yields FeCoP/NPC, which shows prominent activity and reliability for the ORR and OER due primarily to the synergistic effect of FeP and CoP active sites and N/P co-doped carbon. The aqueous Zn-air battery assembled with FeCoP/NPC provides high specific capacity and peak power density. Notably, the constructed Zn-air battery can be repetitively charged and discharged for 1200 h at 5 mA cm(-2). In addition, a flexible solid-state Zn-air battery made from FeCoP/NPC exhibits a power density of 74 mW cm(-2) and repeatedly works for 90 h at 2 mA cm(-2). This work opens up an avenue for the preparation of highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for Zn-air batteries considering the extensive N-rich polymer precursors and various metal phosphide nanoparticles.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000841383500001	35975754

The regulation and mechanism understanding of active oxygen-containing functional groups (OFGs) remain great challenges. Here, OFGs modified porous carbon were prepared by thermal oxidation (MC-12-Air), HNO3 oxidation (MC-12-HNO3) and H2O2 solution hydrothermal treat-ment (MC-12-H2O2 ), respectively. Structural characterization showed that the oxygen doping content of three catalysts reached about 20%, with the almost completely maintained specific surface area (excep-tion of MC -12-HNO3). Spectroscopic characterization further revealed that hydroxyl groups are mainly introduced into MC-12-Air, while carboxyl groups are mainly introduced into MC -12-HNO3 and MC- 12-H2O2 . Compared with the pristine catalyst, three oxygen-functionalized catalysts showed enhanced activity and H2O2 selectivity in 2e(-) ORR. Among them, MC-12-H2O2 exhibited the highest catalytic activ-ity and selectivity of 94 %, as well as a considerable HO2- accumulation of 46.2 mmol L-1 and excellent stability in an extended test over 36 h in a H-cell.

Not only is the capacity to dissipate excess excitations in the antenna much larger and induced more rapidly than in other organisms, but in addition an electron transfer cycle in the reaction center appears to prevent oxidative damage when secondary electron transport cannot keep up with the rate of charge separations. Such cyclic electron transfer had been inferred from oxygen measurements suggesting that some of its intermediates can be reduced in the dark and can subsequently compete with water as an electron donor to Photosystem II upon illumination. Here, the proposed activation of cyclic electron transfer by illumination is confirmed and shown to require only a second. On the other hand the dark reduction of its intermediates, specifically of tyrosine Y-D, the only Photosystem II component known to compete with water oxidation, is ruled out. It appears that the cyclic electron transfer pathway can be fully opened by reduction of the plastoquinone pool in the dark. Oxygen evolution reappears after partial oxidation of the pool by Photosystem I, but the pool itself is not involved in cyclic electron transfer.

The resultant unique structures and well-designed heteroatoms-doping condition impart final catalysts with enhanced mass transfer ability and abundant available active-sites, ensuring high performance in catalyzing ORR.

Here we develop a novel and scalable strategy, containing a ldquocopolymer-co-morphologyrdquo conception, to shape-controlled synthesis of various types of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs). Three series of PBAs MyFe1-y[Co(CN)6]0.67. nH2O (MyFe1-y-Co, M = Co, Mn and Zn) with well-controlled morphology have been successfully prepared through this strategy. Using MnyFe1-y-Co PBAs as the model, by increasing the relative content of Mn, flexible modulation of the morphology could be easily realized. In addition, a series of porous MnxFe1.8-xCo1.2O4 nano-dices with well-inherited morphologies and defined cation distribution could be obtained through a simple thermal treatment of the PBAs. All these results demonstrate the good universality of this novel strategy. When evaluated as an electrocatalyst, the octahedral-site MnIII/MnIV content in MnxFe1.8-xCo1.2O4, mainly determined by sensitive 57Fe Mossbauer in combination with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic techniques, was discovered to be directly correlated with the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2040-3364			INSPEC:16344744

Understanding the nature and mobility of these oxygen-type holes is an important step to improve the performance of devices, but presents a theoretical challenge since, in their localized form, they cannot be captured by standard density functional theory. Here, we employ the DFT+U formalism with a Hubbard correction on the p orbitals of oxygen to investigate several properties of these holes, in the particular case of BaSnO3. We describe the small oxygen-type hole polarons, the self-trapping at their origin, and their trapping by trivalent dopants (Ga, Sc, In, Lu, Y, Gd, La). Strong similarities with protonic defects are observed concerning the evolution of the trapping energy with ionic radius of the dopant. Moreover, we show that long-range diffusion of holes is a complex phenomenon, that proceeds by a succession of several mechanisms. However, the standard implementation of DFT+U within the projector augmented-wave (PAW) formalism leads to use very large, unphysical values of U for the O-p orbital. We propose here a slightly modified DFT+U scheme, that takes into account the fact that the O-p is truncated in usual DFT+U implementation in PAW. This scheme yields more physical values of U than the ones traditionally used in the literature, and describes well the properties of the hole polaron.									21	2	0	0	0	0	22			2469-9950	2469-9969		WOS:000413896800002

THE REACTION SEQUENCE								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE				27	16			4294	4299		10.1007/BF00541555				AUG 15 1992	1992	The conversion of TiO2 (both anatase and rutile) to TiN by carbothermal reduction in nitrogen was found to proceed by progressive reduction through a homologous series of Magneli phase oxides TinO2n-1, where n has values of 4-10. The next phase to be observed by X-ray diffraction is Ti3O5, whose formation from the most stable Magneli phase (Ti4O7) is not predicted by the phase diagram, nor by simple thermodynamic calculations. The conversion of triclinic Ti4O7 to monoclinic Ti3O5 appears to be the slow step in the reaction sequence. Formation of TiN then proceeds directly, apparently without the intervention of Ti2O3 or TiO, as usually assumed. A possible cubic oxynitride intermediate was shown by surface analysis to contain no more than 5% oxygen. A small but significant amount of CO is evolved during the formation of Ti4O7, with a larger CO evolution occurring during the nitridation of Ti3O5. Although no direct mass spectroscopic evidence was found for the formation of C3O2, as suggested by previous workers, the present observed weight losses appear to be consistent with this concept. Both the observed reaction sequence and the pattern of CO evolution is consistent with thermodynamic calculations made using a computer program which takes into account the initial nitrogen concentration, and iterates over small temperature intervals.									53	4	0	0	1	0	57			0022-2461			WOS:A1992JJ21000004

Taking into account the multistep electron-transfer process of oxygen electrocatalytic reactions, it is very desirable to design a suitable construction for electrocatalysts with fantastic electronic transport properties and structural advantages. Herein, we highlight in situ heterointerface engineering and a three-dimensional (3D) porous network structure in preparing the electrocatalysts of N,S-codoped 3D carbon matrix with Co9S8/CoO heterojunction (Co-S-O/NSCN). Systematic characterization and electrochemical experiments confirm that the destabilized charge distribution induced by the Co9S8/CoO heterojunction promotes the fast transfer of electrons during the electrocatalytic process. The well-designed 3D-interconnected network structure composed of 2D nanosheets and in situ-generated 1D carbon nanotubes facilitates the multidimensional electron delivery and reactant migration, along with other additional structural advantages of high surface area and enhanced electronic conductivity. Benefiting from these significant advantages, Co-S-O/NSCN exhibits outstanding oxygen electrocatalytic performance with the ORR half-wave potential of 0.865 V, the OER potential of 1.665 Vat 10 mA cm(-2) (ORR-OER potential gap of 0.80 V), and extraordinary durability in 0.1 M KOH, outperforming the noble-metal Pt/C catalyst and most of the reported Co-based electrocatalysts. Impressively, both the rechargeable Zn-air batteries using liquid and solid electrolytes, assembled by Co-S-O/NSCN catalysts, show satisfactory performance with low charge-discharge gap and long cycling life. This work highlights the superiority of the heterointerface and advanced structural configuration in oxygen electrochemistry, thus giving some inspiration for the fabrication of significant metal-air cathode electrocatalysts.									13	2	0	0	0	0	14			2168-0485			WOS:000610827900046

Two main challenges in this research area are low selectivity, especially for value-added C2+ products and the high overpotentials required to initiate carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The interaction between copper and oxygen has always been inevitable in the design of copper-based catalysts owing to the intrinsic activity of copper and the oxygen-rich environment we live in. Recently, due to the unprecedented development of in-situ characterization, continuously increasing attention has been paid to oxygen species, which is usually accounting for the highest proportion of metalloid composition in copper-based catalysts. Herein, we have summarized the research progress on oxygen-containing copper catalysts, both experimentally and theoretically, and revealed the evolution of oxygen and the relationship between catalytic performance and oxygen species. It is found that the existence of subsurface oxygen in the electrochemical interface of copper-based electrodes has been proved both by in-situ characterization and theoretical simulation, which is also essential for efficient CO2RR to C2+ products. Additionally, selectivity to C2+ products is basically boosted in three ways: facilitating the conversion of CO2 from physical adsorption to chemical adsorption, strengthening intermediate binding and optimizing the adsorption configuration of CO2. It is expected that this review will provide clue for utilizing oxygen to enhance C2+ selectivity in the design of copper-based catalysts. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a simple hydrothermal method was adopted for the synthesis of iodine-doped nickel hydroxide nanoparticles and their OER performance was explored. The electrocatalysts were structurally characterized by powder X-ray diffraction analysis (P-XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and BET analysis. The electrochemical performance of the electrocatalysts was assessed by cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The abundant catalytic active sites, oxygen vacancies, low charge-transfer resistance, and a high pore diameter to pore size ratio of iodine-doped Ni(OH)(2) were responsible for its excellent catalytic activity, whereby OER was initiated even at 1.52 V (vs. RHE) and a 330 mV overpotential was needed to reach a 40 mV cm(-2) current density in 1 M KOH solution. The material also exhibited a low Tafel slope (46 mV dec(-1)), which suggests faster charge-transfer kinetics as compared to its counterparts tested under the same electrochemical environment. It is worth noting that this facile and effective approach suggests a new way for the fabrication of metal hydroxides rich in oxygen vacancies, thus with the potential to boost the electrochemical performance of energy-related systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000842230300001	36090404

Cellular respiration is dependent on such redox reactions, and any imbalance leads to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in both chronic and acute illnesses. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), by 2040, the global burden of new cancer cases is expected to be around 27.5 million, with 16.3 million cancer deaths due to an increase in risk factors, such as unhealthy lifestyle, environmental factors, aberrant gene mutations, and resistance to therapies. ROS play an important role in cellular signaling, but they can cause severe damage to tissues when present at higher levels. Elevated and chronic levels of ROS are pertinent in carcinogenesis, while several therapeutic strategies rely on altering cellular ROS to eliminate tumor cells as they are more susceptible to ROS-induced damage than normal cells. Given this selective targeting potential, therapies that can effectively modulate ROS levels have been the focus of intense research in recent years. This review describes biologically relevant ROS, its origins in solid and hematological cancers, and the current status of evolving antioxidant and pro-oxidant therapies in cancers.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1071-5762	1029-2470		WOS:000870177600001	36214686

The electrochemical performance of LSCF electrodes for the O-2 reduction reaction (ORR) under solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) mode and for the O-2 evolution reaction (OER) under solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) mode is seriously degraded after exposure to Cr-containing air at open circuit voltage. SEM, XRD and Raman spectroscopy analyses reveal the formation of SrCrO4 phase and the deposition of a similar to 1 mu m thick Cr deposit layer on the outer surface of LSCF electrodes after exposure to Fe-Cr alloy interconnect at 900 degrees C for 20 h under open circuit conditions, greatly limiting the oxygen exchange and diffusion related processes. However, the magnitude of Cr deposition decreases significantly with the decrease in temperature. The results also confirm that the mechanism of Cr deposition on LSCF electrodes is a chemical process in nature that is initiated most likely by the nucleation reaction between surface segregated SrOx and gaseous Cr species.

To promote photocatalytic oxidation for gaseous pollutant over g-C3N4, a solid gas interfacial Fenton reaction is coupled into alkalinized g-C3N4-based photocatalyst to effectively convert photocatalytic generation of H2O2 into oxygen-related radicals. This system includes light energy as power, alkalinized g-C3N4-based photocatalyst as an in situ and robust H2O2 generator, and surface-decorated Fe3+ as a trigger of H2O2 conversion, which attains highly efficient and universal activity for photodegradation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Taking the photooxidation of isopropanol as model reaction, this system achieves a photoactivity of 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than that of pristine g-C3N4, which corresponds to a high apparent quantum yield of 49% at around 420 nm. In-situ electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy and sacrificial-reagent incorporated photocatalytic characterizations indicate that the notable photoactivity promotion could be ascribed to the collaboration between photocarriers (electrons and holes) and Fenton process to produce abundant and reactive oxygen-related radicals. The strategy of coupling solid gas interfacial Fenton process into semiconductor-based photocatalysis provides a facile and promising solution to the remediation of air pollution via solar energy.									293	12	0	0	40	0	295			0002-7863			WOS:000385469600034	27643711

Moreover, should it be always present in the bulk, octahedrally coordinated cobalt is unobservable in the surface region of highly oxygen-deficient samples. On the other hand, the surface region hosts square-pyramidally coordinated cobalt even in brownmillerite SrCoO2.50, Observations in the present work support an oxygen-intercalation mechanism in which (i) O-2 is first absorbed on the surface as O-2(-), (ii) then reductively split into Ox- associated with square-pyramidally coordinated cobalt, and (iii) finally in the bulk eventually reoxidized to Oz- (0 < z < x) being attached to octahedrally coordinated cobalt. The fact that only minute chemical shifts of the Co-L edge branches are seen indicates that electron transfer mostly takes place between oxygen atoms.									83	3	0	0	4	0	83			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000273265500013

KMnO4 exposure reduced the rate of oxygen evolution and cell growth. High concentration of KMnO4 (10 mg L-1) decreased the fast phase and increased the slow phase of Q(A)(-) reoxidation kinetics. Electron transport after Q(A) was blocked, resulting in a considerable amount of Q(A)(-) reoxidation being performed via S-2(Q(A)Q(B))(-) charge recombination. KMnO4 decreased the density of the active photosynthetic reaction centers and the maximum quantum yield for primary photochemistry and inhibited electron transport, which resulted in a decline of the performance of PSII activity and caused an increase in dissipated energy flux per reaction center and antenna size. Our results suggest that both the donor side and the acceptor on the phase of Q(A)(-) to Q(B) to PQ of PSII in M. aeruginosa were targets of KMnO4 toxicity.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0300-3604	1573-9058		WOS:000518819800007

In particular, the development of electric or hydrogen powered vehicles calls for much-higher-performance batteries, supercapacitors and fuel cells than are currently available. In this review, we present an approach to synthesize electrochemical energy storage materials to form strongly coupled hybrids (SC-hybrids) of inorganic nanomaterials and novel graphitic nano-carbon materials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene, through nucleation and growth of nanoparticles at the functional groups of oxidized graphitic nano-carbon. We show that the inorganic-nano-carbon hybrid materials represent a new approach to synthesize electrode materials with higher electrochemical performance than traditional counterparts made by simple physical mixtures of electrochemically active inorganic particles and conducting carbon materials. The inorganic-nano-carbon hybrid materials are novel due to possible chemical bonding between inorganic nanoparticles and oxidized carbon, affording enhanced charge transport and increased rate capability of electrochemical materials without sacrificing specific capacity. Nano-carbon with various degrees of oxidation provides a novel substrate for nanoparticle nucleation and growth. The interactions between inorganic precursors and oxidized-carbon substrates provide a degree of control over the morphology, size and structure of the resulting inorganic nanoparticles. This paper reviews the recent development of inorganic-nano-carbon hybrid materials for electrochemical energy storage and conversion, including the preparation and functionalization of graphene sheets and carbon nanotubes to impart oxygen containing groups and defects, and methods of synthesis of nanoparticles of various morphologies on oxidized graphene and carbon nanotubes.

Herein, a two-dimensional metal-organic framework (MOF) with mono-coordinated ferrocenecarboxylic acid (Fc) is successfully prepared. Different from the pure MOF, the as-prepared Fc-MOF offers remarkable electrocatalytic activity, exhibiting a low overpotential of 273 mV (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) at 200 mA cm(-2) and a small driving potential of 1.49 V (10 mA cm(-2)) for the overall water splitting with Pt/C as a counterpart cathode. The advance nature of the as-prepared Fc-MOF could also be evidenced by its remarkable Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) activity as it drives a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a potential of 1.35 V. Theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that the introduction of highly electronegative Fc not only change the electronic structure of MOF but also expose more unsaturated active sites, which in turn varies the adsorption features of the intermediate species during the catalytic process. This work represents a new pathway for exploration of highly efficient MOF based electrocatalysts.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000729803300005

In this work, a natural organic agent has been used to synthesize nano-structured ZnO/Mn3O4 with high surface area and enhanced electrocatalytic performance. Upon pre-annealing treatment, mixed metal oxide precipitates are formed due to the complex formation between a metal oxide and organic extract. The thermally annealed mixed oxide ZnO/Mn3O4 was characterized by XRD diffractometer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) identified methyldecylamine as a major stabilizing agent of the synthesized nanomaterial. Using a Tauc plot, the calculated band energy for the synthesized ZnO/Mn3O4 mixed metal oxide was 1.65 eV. Moreover, we have demonstrated the effects of incorporated organic compounds on the surface chemistry, morphology and electrochemical behavior of ZnO/Mn3O4. The phyto-functionalized ZnO/Mn3O4 was deposited on Ni-foam for electrocatalytic studies. The fabricated electrode revealed good performance with low over-potential and Tafel slope, suggesting it to be suitable as a potential catalyst for water splitting application, in particular for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The overall findings of the current study provide a cost-effective and efficient organic template for functionalization and sustainable fabrication of ZnO/Mn3O4 nanomaterial for application as an electrocatalyst.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15				2046-2069		WOS:000520511800011	35498591

For the first time, we investigate newly experimentally realized two-dimensional hexaaminobenzene-based coordination polymers (2D HAB-CPs) as OER and ORR catalysts through computational screening approach. We find that the interaction strength between intermediates and the transition metal complex (TM-N-4) govern the catalytic activity of 2D HAB-CPs for OER and ORR. The interaction strength is strongly contingent on d-band centers, which can be modulated by changing TM atoms with different d-electron occupations. This modification of the interaction strength allows us to screen out the catalyst with the best catalytic performance. The best catalyst for OER is 2D Rh-HAB-CP with an over-potential (eta) of 0.32 V, followed by Co-HAB-CP (0.41 V), while for ORR, Fe-HAB-CP has a smallest maximum free energy change (Delta G(max)(1.23)) of 0.52 eV under equilibrium potential. Furthermore, these results inspire us to design a bifunctional OER/ORR catalyst by mixing Fe/Co precursors in 2D HAB-CP with the ORR/OER theoretical overpotentials even lower than that of the best ORR/OER catalysts (Pt/RuO2). In addition, all the 2D HAB-CPs are metallic due to the effects of d-p-pi conjugation, which ensures fast electron transfer during the electrochemical reactions.

Herein, we fabricate PtCuFe alloy nanochains (NCs) that have a tunable composition by flexibly adjusting the molar ratios of the metal precursors. It was found that Cu2+ is key in the formation of 1D NCs, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy character-izations. In addition, the alloyed Fe can further increase the content of the metallic state of Cu in the PtCuFe NCs. The as-prepared PtCuFe NCs exhibited higher catalytic activity and stability than those of the Pt nanoparticles (NPs), PtFe NPs, and PtCu NCs, for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and HER. Additionally, the composition-performance relationship of PtCuxFey NCs toward the MOR and HER were investigated. The hybrid density functional theory calculation and analysis showed that the 1D PtCuFe NCs have a lower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) than those of the 2-and 3 -dimensional PtCuFe, verifying that the 1D PtCuFe NCs exhibit the highest activity for the MOR. This work has established a new method for the controllable synthesis of multi-metal Pt-based NCs/alloy catalysts and their subsequent applications in other electro-catalytic reactions.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

The (electro)chemically induced transformation of their initially crystalline surface into an amorphous state has been reported for a few highly active perovskite catalysts. However, little knowledge is available to distinguish the contribution of the amorphized surface from that of the remaining bulk toward the OER. In this work, we utilize the promoting effects of two types of Fe modification, i.e., bulk Fe dopant and Fe ions absorbed from the electrolyte, on the OER activity of SrCoO3-delta model perovskite to identify the active phase. Transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the surface amorphization of SrCoO3-delta as well as SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-delta after potential cycling in Fe-free KOH solution. By further cycling in Fe-spiked electrolyte, Fe was incorporated into the amorphized surface of SrCoO3-delta (SrCoO3-delta + Fe3+), yielding approximately sixfold increase in activity. Despite the difference in remaining perovskites, SrCoO3-delta + Fe3+ and SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-delta exhibited remarkably similar activity. These results reflect that the in situ developed surface species are directly responsible for the measured OER activity, whereas the remaining bulk phases have little impact.									22	0	0	0	0	0	21				2691-3704		WOS:000651111900013	34467274

Here we present a facile and controllable strategy to synthesize a strongly coupled ultrasmall-cobalt phosphide/nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon (u-CoP@NC) hybrid structure via phosphorization from a porous coordination polymer (PCP) precursor. The PCP-derived u-CoP@NC exhibits remarkable activity and stability for HER, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a low overpotential of 131 mV in acidic media and 111 mV in basic media. The corresponding Tafel slopes present in acidic and basic media are 62.7 and 70.3 mV dec(-1), respectively. Results reveal that the enhanced electrocatalytic performance of u-CoP@NC originates from the strongly coupled u-CoP nanoparticles and graphitic carbon layer, and the perfect dispersity of the active sites. This research opens up new avenues for designing earth abundant metal-based electrocatalysts with high capability for water splitting applications. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Usually metal/nonmetal elemental doping and unique nanostructure can be used to adjust the M-H bonding energy for accelerating both generation and departure of H-2. Herein, a simple in-situ phos-phorsulfurization method has been used to synthesized nickel cobalt phosphosulphide (NiCoP vertical bar S/CC) nanoneedles grown on the surface of carbon cloth (CC) at low temperature as electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in both acid (0.5 M H2SO4) and alkaline (1.0 M KOH) electrolyte solution. Typically, NiCo2O4/CC with nanoneedles structure is used as precursor. And NaH2PO2 and H2S is used as phosphorus and sulfur source, respectively. Compared with single metal phosphophides, the enhanced electrocatalytic performance of NiCoP vertical bar S/CC for HER can be attributed to the formation of new specie phosphosulphide and synergistic effect between phosphosulphide and carbon support CC. This work provide a new method with adjusting Delta G(H*) of active sites for preparing the excellent electro-catalysts for water splitting. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Conventional anode is Ni based material, and it is stable in steady electrolysis; however it deteriorates in some cases with the fluctuation of electric power supply, for example where renewable energy such as wind or solar power. To improve durability under potential fluctuation, we have investigated the catalytic activity and durability of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for three types of Ni based electrodes with and without pre-oxidation under potential cycling. Surface oxidized nickel anode was more stable than nickel anode, but it is less active than nickel in high current density region because of electronic resistance of surface oxide. Lithium doped surface oxide improved electronic conductivity, and it had the better activity and durability than those of both nickel and surface oxidized nickel.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1938-6737			INSPEC:14676520

In this regard, substantial progress has been made in theoretically predicting new materials for energy-related fields, experimentally synthesizing these materials, and further improving their properties for high performance in energy storage and conversion devices. In particular, two-dimensional (2D) materials have shown great potential in the field of energy storage and conversion. However, it remains challenging to explore 2D materials that render high efficiency of energy storage and conversion while guarantee long-term stability and safety. Over the past decades, theoretical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) have become a practical toolkit to address this issue by revealing the reaction mechanism at an atomic scale and screening high-performance energy storage and conversion materials on a large scale. In particular, DFT calculations enable us to establish the relationships between the intrinsic properties of materials and their performance for energy storage and conversion, and provide theoretical guidance for screening and experimentally synthesizing the promising materials.In this review, we summarize the DFT calculations' applications in recent studies of developing high-performance and reliable energy-related 2D materials for Li-ion battery (LIB), water splitting, fuel cells, and electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CRR). First, we introduce the reaction mechanism of LIB, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction/oxygen reduction reaction (OER/ORR), and CRR in detail and the application of 2D material in these fields. Then, we highlight the role of DFT calculations in unveiling the intrinsic relationships between the electronic structure and the performance of 2D materials by comprehensively discussing the descriptors in predicting the performance of 2D materials. For example, the occupancy of d orbital and energy required to fill empty states serve as descriptors to predict the electrochemical performance of the electrode in ion intercalation battery. The d orbital center, lowest unoccupied states, and oxygen vacancy formation energy serve as descriptors to predict the catalytic performance of electrode in HER. The energy difference between the lowest valance electron orbital center and Fermi level, occupancy of pz orbital, and the energy difference between p(z) and p(x)/p(y) orbital center serve as descriptors to predict the catalytic performance of electrode in ORR. Even though these descriptors can help to further understand the relationships between the electronic structure and the performance of the electrochemical electrode, they are only reliable to specific materials and inapplicable to the electrode with a complex structure or complex reaction path, such as the electrode in CRR. Newly developed machine learning methods may bring a breakthrough to the exploration of a universal descriptor, which is a key factor in the large-scale screening of potential electrode materials with excellent performance and the dependable guidance to experimental synthesis. Finally, we summarize the disadvantage of DFT calculation, such as the underestimation of bandgap and incorrect description of van der Waals interaction, and give a perspective of DFT calculations in the study of new energy-related materials. The method to simulate the ambient environment of the electrode (including the electrolyte, external electric field, and non-cooperative transfer of proton and electron) based on DFT calculation is needed to be developed, which is vital to reflect the actual working condition of the electrode. The universal descriptor applicable to the electrode with a complex structure is also needed to explore to overcome the poor versatility of single intrinsic property of the material in predicting the performance of the electrochemical electrode.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0023-074X	2095-9419		WOS:000628672500009

Heteroatom doping and structure engineering have been identified as the most effective strategies to boost the catalytic activity of electrocatalysts. Herein, Mn doping and hollow structure were integrated in the design of Co-based transition metal phosphide catalyst to prepare Mn-CoP/Co2P nanotubes (denoted as Mn-CP NTs) by a facile template-free method.Confirmed by characterization analysis, the introduced Mn species were in high dispersion in the regular CoP/Co2P hollow tubular framework. Such a favorable design in composition and structure effectively boosted the catalytic activity of Mn-CP NTs toward electrochemical water splitting. The Mn-CP NTs showed superior HER and OER activity demonstrated by the low overpotentials of 82 mV (vs HER) and 309 mV (vs OER) at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), as well as the satisfactory durability. When used as both cathode and anode in electrolyzer for overall water splitting, only a low cell voltage of 1.67 V was required for the Mn-CP NTs to drive 10 mA cm-2, accompanied with excellent stability confirmed by over 50 h test.

Herein, both interfacial FeOOH/CoO nanosheets (FeOOH/CoO-NSs) and nanowires array (FeOOH/CoO-NWs) were in situ constructed on nickel foam (NF) through a simple one-step hydrothermal approach. The rational selection of Fe(NO3)(3)center dot 9H(2)O as a Fe source prevents the formation of nanosheet, and enables the generation of nanowire structure due to chemical affination. Benefiting from the synergistic interaction between FeOOH-CoO interface and the unique nanowires array structure, the resultant FeOOH/CoO-NWs/NF exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity towards both OER and HER. For the overall water splitting, the bifunctional FeOOH/CoO nanoneedle catalyst requires a cell voltage of only 1.61 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is much lower than that required for IrO2 parallel to Pt/C (1.62 V). The present work provides a new horizon to design highly efficient water splitting catalysts through synergistic modulation of interface and micro-nano structures.									8	1	0	0	2	0	9			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000644702700046

In order to meet the increasing energy demands and assist in the transition from a global economy that relies heavily on fossil fuels to one that utilizes more renewable energy sources, there is urgent need to develop highperforming electrocatalysts toward renewable energy related reactions. These catalysts are expected to have low overpotentials, high reaction selectivity, long cycling stability, and, importantly, lower materials costs to address the challenges of traditional nanoparticulate noble metal catalysts. One approach to conquering a transition of such scale is the use of single-atom electrocatalysts which can bring benefits of lowered materials cost, increased reaction selectivity, and improved catalytic activity. However, despite some success in recent years there remain challenges such as the stability of singleatom catalysts over time, especially at high operating temperatures and potentials, and the limited loading of single-atom catalysts on a support matrix. This Account will discuss the use of graphene as the support matrix with heavy focus on the progress in developing 3D nanoporous graphene, synthesized by chemical vapor deposition. We will cover how 3D nanoporous graphene possesses a large specific surface area, open porosity, high electric conductivity, and bound geometric and topological defects and analyze how it is emerging as an excellent support material for developing chemically stable and catalytically active single-atom catalysts with a large loading amount and high electrocatalytic efficiency. Additionally, we will highlight the benefits of the presence of topological and geometric defects, from curved graphene in the 3D structure, and how they can bring more chemically active sites, and how, together with chemical dopants, they can improve the catalytic performance, stability, and loading amount of single-atom catalysts via their strong chemical affinity with transition metals and the formation of active M-Nx-Cy (M = transition metals, N-nitrogen, C-carbon) moieties. Furthermore, we will discuss two common methods for fabrication of single-atom catalysts on nanoporous graphene: (1) controlled etching for non-noble and noble metal catalysts and (2) atomic layer deposition for noble metal catalysts. The electrochemical performances of these single-atom catalysts will be reviewed with the applications toward hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. This Account highlights advances made in solving the challenges of developing 3D nanoporous graphene based single-atom catalysts and the benefits that the new single-atom catalysts can bring to the applications in energy storage and conversion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2643-6728		WOS:000843538200001		
J	Huang, Lillian; Adams, Fred C.; Grohs, Evan								Sensitivity of carbon and oxygen yields to the triple-alpha resonance in massive stars								ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS				105				13	24		10.1016/j.astropartphys.2018.09.005				FEB 2019	2019	Motivated by the possible existence of other universes, this paper considers the evolution of massive stars with different values for the fundamental constants. We focus on variations in the triple alpha resonance energy and study its effects on the resulting abundances of C-12, O-16, and larger nuclei. In our universe, the 0(+) energy level of carbon supports a resonant nuclear reaction that dominates carbon synthesis in stellar cores and accounts for the observed cosmic abundances. Here we define Delta E-R to be the change in this resonant energy level, and show how different values affect the cosmic abundances of the intermediate alpha elements. Using the state of the art computational package MESA, we carry out stellar evolution calculations for massive stars in the range M. = 15 - 40M(circle dot), and for a wide range of resonance energies. We also include both solar and low metallicity initial conditions. For negative Delta E-R, carbon yields are increased relative to standard stellar models, and such universes remain viable as long as the production of carbon nuclei remains energetically favorable, and stars remain stable, down to Delta E-R approximate to -300 keV. For positive Delta E-R, carbon yields decrease, but significant abundances can be produced for resonance energy increments up to Delta E-R approximate to +500 keV. Oxygen yields tend to be anti-correlated with those of carbon, and the allowed range in Delta E-R is somewhat smaller. We also present yields for neon, magnesium, and silicon. With updated stellar evolution models and a more comprehensive survey of parameter space, these results indicate that the range of viable universes is larger than suggested by earlier studies.

In Fe-N-C catalysts, the single Fe atom forms a square-planar configuration with four adjacent N atoms (D-4h symmetry). Breaking the D-4h symmetry of the FeN4 active center provides a new route to boost the activity of Fe-N-C catalysts. Herein, for the first time, the deformation of the square-planar coordination of FeN4 moiety achieved by introducing chalcogen oxygen groups (XO2, X = S, Se, Te) as polar functional groups in the Fe-N-C catalyst is reported. The theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that breaking the D-4h symmetry of FeN4 results in the rearrangement of Fe 3d electrons and increases spin moment of Fe centers. The efficient spin state manipulation optimizes the adsorption energetics of ORR intermediates, thereby significantly promoting the intrinsic ORR activity of Fe-N-C catalysts, among which the SeO2 modified catalyst lies around the peak of the ORR volcano plot. This work provides a new strategy to tune the local coordination and thus the electronic structure of single-atom catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2198-3844		WOS:000849504100001	36057997	
J	Das, A; Uchimiya, H								Oxygen stress and adaptation of a semi-aquatic plant: rice (Oryza sativa)								JOURNAL OF PLANT RESEARCH				115	1121			315	320		10.1007/s10265-002-0043-9				OCT 2002	2002	One of the major abiotic stresses that affects plant growth and development is anoxia or hypoxia. Rice is a semi-aquatic plant bestowed with the capability of overcoming oxygen limitation for a considerable period of time. For instance, it can withstand submergence stress either by inherent metabolic adaptations (resistant type), or by keeping its leaves above the water surface by continuously elongating the stem (avoiding type). In the former case, an interplay, of several metabolic pathways engaged in anaerobic fermentation keeps the submerged plant alive for a certain period of time. In the latter type, also known as deepwater rice, continuous stem elongation brought about by a series of reactions in planta enables the shoot to remain above the water surface and thus maintain respiration and photosynthesis. However, the earliest event, i.e., sensing the oxygen level that brings about all the changes, has not been clearly understood. This paper intends to evaluate the metabolic adaptations of rice plants to oxygen constraints.									31	4	1	0	25	2	35			0918-9440	1618-0860		WOS:000178919500001	12579355

Transition-metal sulfides have appeared to be promising non-noble metal cocatalysts in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to meet future energy demands. Meanwhile, many studies focus on the fabrication of bimetallic catalysts because of their remarkably superior catalytic activity compared with monometallic substances. Herein, amorphous bimetallic cobalt nickel sulfide (CoNiSx) was fabricated to work as a cocatalyst in the photocatalytic H-2 evolution reaction, which can couple with pristine graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4). CoNiSx-CN exhibits a larger specific surface area compared with g-C3N4, making it possess more reaction active sites. Moreover, the contacted interface in the CoNiSx-CN composite photocatalyst contributes to higher separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, which was proved by experimental and theoretical calculations. More importantly, the theoretical calculation also verified that CoNiSx-CN has relatively closer Gibbs free energy to zero than pure g-C3N4 and corresponding monometallic cocatalyzed g-C3N4. Therefore, the prepared CoNiSx-CN composite exhibited a dramatic photocatalytic HER performance of 2.366 mu mol mg(-1) h(-1), which is about 76-fold higher in comparison with pristine g-C3N4 and comparable to g-C3N4 with Pt as a cocatalyst under 420 nm light irradiation. This study reveals a promising and efficient bimetallic cocatalyst for the photocatalytic H-2 evolution reaction.									77	12	0	0	4	0	80			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000479020300035	31268294

Herein, we for the first time present the nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) of nanosheets morphology (NCO-NSs) and nanowires morphology (NCO-NWs) as an efficient electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution, affording a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotential of 170 mV for the HER and 230 mV for the OER, respectively. With the aid of DFT calculation, we have evaluated their special catalytic activities by focusing on the position of d-band centers and adsorption energy of intermediates (H-2*, H*, H2O*, OH*, O*, OOH*, and O-2*) on catalyst surface. The result reveals that the rate determining-step for HER and OER is H* and O* adsorption, respectively, with the Ni-Td(3+) (Ni3+ occupied at the tetrahedral site) being the active site for water splitting. A highly efficient two-electrode electrolyzer based on NCO-NSs parallel to NCO-NWs configuration is designed and tested for long-term stability evolution. Furthermore, a NCO-NSs parallel to NCO-NWs based alkaline electrolyzer can be approach 15 mA cm(-2) at 1.65 V, superior to that of Pt parallel to IrO2 couple, along with strong stability.									32	1	0	0	1	0	32			1932-7447			WOS:000416496200030

Herein, a rationally assembled three-dimensional (3D) architecture of 1D graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanoribbons with 2D graphene sheets has been developed by a one-step hydrothermal method. Because of the multipathway of charge and mass transport, the hierarchically structured g-C3N4 nanoribbon-graphene hybrids lead to a high electrocatalytic ability for HER with a Tafel slope of 54mVdecade(-1), a low onset overpotential of 80mV and overpotential of 207mV to approach a current of 10mAcm(-2), superior to those non-metal materials and well-developed metallic catalysts reported previously.

However, continuous capacity fading and voltage hysteresis have largely restricted their practical application. In this work, we investigated in depth the voltage-fading mechanism of Li-rich materials by in situ Raman spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). It has been found that the chemical and structural evolution of a Li1.2Ni0.15Co0.1Mn0.55O2 cathode is quasi-reversible in a whole charge-discharge cycle. The structural evolution is evidently irreversible upon long-term cycling, resulting in the dissolution of cations from the lattices and structural collapse, which in turn leads to undesirable voltage fading. This finding is important for a better understanding of the redox reaction mechanisms of high-capacity Li-rich cathodes.									7	2	0	0	1	0	9			2052-1553			WOS:000605454900014		
J	Niksa, S								Flashchain theory for rapid coal devolatilization kinetics .7. Predicting the release of oxygen species from various coals								ENERGY & FUELS				10	1			173	187		10.1021/ef950067l				JAN-FEB 1996	1996	The release of oxygen from any coal primarily involves only three mechanisms: the shuttling of oxygen as an element in tar molecules; the simultaneous release of CO2, H2O, and small amounts of CO when labile bridges are converted into char links; and the release of CO from the residual oxygen in nascent char links at high temperatures. This modeling study characterizes these processes for heating rates from 0.5 to 10(4) K/s, temperatures to 1550 K, and pressures from 0.1 to 1 MPa. Evaluations against a database compiled from the behavior of 27 coal samples representing ranks from lignite to anthracite demonstrate that CO2, H2O, and CO yields plus the oxygen contents of tar and char can be predicted within useful tolerances throughout this domain. With Flashchain, no additional parameters or rate expressions are required to quantitatively predict the contributions from tar shuttling from any coal at any operating conditions. And the release rates of CO2, H2O, and low-temperature CO release are set equal to the previously evaluated formation rates of char links. Only one reaction rate expression (but no hypothetical ultimate yield parameter) is required to predict the yields and evolution rates of CO at high temperatures. This modeling approach departs from multiple, independent conversion channels for each gas product and instead recognizes the conversion of labile bridges into refractory char links as the fundamental process underlying the release of most of the oxygen-bearing noncondensible gases. As consequences of this premise, (a) oxygen is shuttled away in tars and simultaneously released as CO2 and H2O at all heating rates; (b) oxygen gas yields, especially H2O and CO yields, diminish in tandem with enhanced tar yields for faster heating rates or lower pressures; and (c) the onset of oxygen gas release shifts to higher temperatures for coals of progressively higher rank, particularly for low volatility coals. Production rates of high-temperature CO accelerate rapidly after the end of tar evolution, overtaking the production of CO2 and H2O from all coal types. CO is released over narrower temperature ranges for coals of progressively higher rank.									43	4	0	0	0	0	46			0887-0624			WOS:A1996TR49500023

Benefitting from the hierarchical heterostructures and synergistic effect that come from the outer Mn2P and inner Co0.5Fe0.5P nanowires, the optimized Mn2P-5@Co0.5Fe0.5P/CC electrode exhibited admirable HER activity with a quite small overpotential of 77 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent durability in 1 M KOH electrolyte.

Herein, we report the synthesis of a porphyrin-based metal-free covalent organic polymer (TpPAM) through a simple condensation between triformyl phloroglucinol (Tp) and 5,10,15,20-tetra-(4-amino-phenyl)-21H,23H-porphyrin (PAM). The as-prepared porous TpPAM exhibited superior activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 250 mV and a small Tafel slope of 106 mV decade(-1), which are better than those of related metal-free electrocatalysts. The high HER activity of TpPAM was investigated in-depth via theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The theoretical findings were correlated with the experimental results, and these were in good agreement for high HER catalytic efficiency of the porous TpPAM polymer. The Faradaic efficiency of the TpPAM-based electrode was found to be 98%, which is very close to the ideal value of 100%, reflecting its potential for practical implementation. Moreover, the as-synthesized catalyst showed good stability by retaining 91% of the initial current density after 1000 cycles.									136	8	0	0	10	1	137			2155-5435			WOS:000410005700063

The value we obtain, 111.7 +/- 0.1 eV, is in good agreement with previous results. We have also determined the chemical shift of the core level in an oxygen environment to be 2.68 +/- 0.06 eV. Using the same technique, we have followed the evolution of the core-level peak as Be undergoes surface reaction induced by background gases present in the vacuum (mainly water vapour and nitrogen). The core-level peak intensities as a function of time clearly show that reaction of the Be surface progresses in two distinct steps. The initial relatively rapid stage progresses up to a coverage of around 18 L of H2O and N-2 after which the onset of a slower reaction process is observed. These results demonstrate the ability of EMS to provide time-resolved electronic structure measurements as a solid undergoes chemical modification. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Copper-chromium-iron oxide-based catalysts have been widely used for the high-temperature WGS reaction industrially. The WGS reaction mechanism by the CuCrFePOx catalyst has been debated for years, mainly between a "redox" mechanism involving the participation of atomic oxygen from the catalyst and an "associative" mechanism proceeding via a surface formate-like intermediate. In the present work, advanced in situ characterization techniques (infrared spectroscopy, temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR), near-ambient pressure XPS (NAP-XPS), and inelastic neutron scattering (INS)) were applied to determine the nature of the catalyst surface and identify surface intermediate species under WGS reaction conditions. The surface of the CuCrFeOx catalyst is found to be dynamic and becomes partially reduced under WGS reaction conditions, forming metallic Cu nanoparticles on Fe3O4. Neither in situ IR not INS spectroscopy detect the presence of surface formate species during WGS. TPSR experiments demonstrate that the evolution of CO2 and H-2 from the CO/H2O reactants follows different kinetics than the evolution of CO2 and H-2 from HCOOH decomposition (molecule mimicking the associative mechanism). Steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) (CO + (H2O)-O-16 -> CO + (H2O)-O-18) exhibited significant O-16/O-18 scrambling, characteristic of a redox mechanism. Computed activation energies for elementary steps for the redox and associative mechanism by density functional theory (DFT) simulations indicate that the redox mechanism is favored over the associative mechanism. The combined spectroscopic, computational, and kinetic evidence in the present study finally resolves the WGS reaction mechanism on the industrial-type high-temperature CuCrFeOx, catalyst that is shown to proceed via the redox mechanism.									37	2	0	0	2	0	38			0002-7863			WOS:000468366900043	31021093

In order to drive the water splitting reaction efficiently, substantial ohmic losses due to poor ionic conductivity of the electrolyte should be avoided, and therefore the reaction should be carried out at an extreme electrolyte pH. Herein we demonstrate the photoelectrochemical activity of an amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) photocathode for solar hydrogen evolution using an ultrathin nickel (Ni) film coupled with a nickel molybdenum catalyst (Ni-Mo) in a highly alkaline solution (pH 14). The incorporation of the Ni film coupled with Ni-Mo nanoparticles increases the number of active sites and therefore improves the kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction. Additionally, we report the influence of the catalyst configurations on the ohmic and solid liquid junction behavior on semiconducting interfacial layers. The a-SiC photocathode coated with the Ni/Ni-Mo dual-catalyst produces a photocurrent density of -14 mA cm(-2) at 0 V vs. RHE using only cheap and abundant materials. This photocurrent is the highest recorded value from an amorphous-Si-based photocathode, and is achieved with a total film thickness of less than 150 nm.									30	0	0	0	4	0	30			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000375608500015

The microstructure and chemical composition of the samples was characterized by XRD,SAED and EDS. The electrochemical performance of the prepared samples was analyzed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and charge-discharge tests. The results showed that this amorphous nickel hydroxide codoped with Ce and Fe had more structural defects than those of Fe singly doped amorphous nickel hydroxide. These abundant structural defects with Ce and Fe codoped amorphous nickel hydroxide increased the thermal stability, decreased the charge transfer resistance, inhibited oxygen evolution reaction effectively and improved the electrochemical reversibility of the amorphous nickel hydroxide electrode.

Here, bimetallic (Fe/Co) and bi-nonmetallic (N/S) codoping porous carbon nanosheets (Fe/Co-N/S-Cs) with uniform and ultrathin thickness of about 4.63 nm were first synthesized by a novel and multifunctional inorganic mixing salt-template (FeCl3 and CoSO4). Fe/Co-N/S-Cs exhibit ultrahigh specific surface area (SSA: 1589 m(2) g(-1)), total pore volume (TPV: 0.92 cm(3) g(-1)), homogeneous distribution of heteroatom dopants, as well as an appropriate amount of carbon defects. Fe/Co-N/S-Cs show high half-wave potential (E-1/2 = 0.832 V) for ORR and extremely low overpotential of 285 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, exceeding most reported electrocatalysts. Furthermore, assembled Zn-air batteries employing Fe/Co-N/S-Cs as cathode catalyst exhibit high power density (102.63 mW cm(-2)) and excellent stability.

Nevertheless, many fundamental questions such as their actual active species and the influence on long-term stability remain to be answered. Herein, we present the structural evolution from a pseudotri-component electrocatalyst of nitrogen-doped carbon supported nickel/vanadium nitride/vanadium oxide (Ni-VN-V2O3/NC) nanorods to the heterostructural nickel/vanadium nitride (Ni-VN/NC) nanosheets during chemical or electrochemical processes. The self-reconstructed Ni-VN/NC exhibits a robust stability under alkaline conditions, while maintaining initial efficient HER activity with a low overpotential of 76 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2).

Theoretical studies predict that its 2D form is a potential photocatalyst for water splitting reactions. Herein, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) characterization of GaSe nanoflakes (single-/few-layer flakes), produced via liquid phase exfoliation, for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in both acidic and alkaline media is reported. In 0.5 m H2SO4, the GaSe photoelectrodes display the best PEC performance, corresponding to a ratiometric power-saved metric for HER (phi(saved,HER)) of 0.09% and a ratiometric power-saved metric for OER (phi(saved,OER)) of 0.25%. When used as PEC-type photodetectors, GaSe photoelectrodes show a responsivity of approximate to 0.16 A W-1 upon 455 nm illumination at a light intensity of 63.5 mu W cm(-2) and applied potential of -0.3 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Stability tests of GaSe photodetectors demonstrated a durable operation over tens of cathodic linear sweep voltammetry scans in 0.5 m H2SO4 for HER. In contrast, degradation of photoelectrodes occurred in both alkaline and anodic operation due to the highly oxidizing environment and O-2-induced (photo)oxidation effects. The results provide new insight into the PEC properties of GaSe nanoflakes for their exploitation in photoelectrocatalysis, PEC-type photodetectors, and (bio)sensors.									47	2	0	0	2	0	48			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000508284300001

Colloidal Cu NCs are synthesized via the disproportionation reaction of copper (I) bromide in the presence of a non-polar solvent mixture. It is observed that the shape of Cu NCs is systematically controlled by the addition of different amounts of DMF to the reaction mixture in high-temperature reaction conditions while maintaining a high size uniformity and shape purity. With increasing amount of DMF in the reaction mixture, the morphology of the Cu NCs change from a cube enclosed by six {100} facets, to a sphere with mixed surface facets, and finally, to an octahedron enclosed by eight {111} facets. The origin of this shape evolution is understood via first-principles density functional theory calculations, which allows the study of the change in the relative surface stability according to surface-coordinating adsorbates. Further, the shape-dependent plasmonic properties are systematically investigated with highly uniform and ligand-exchanged colloidal Cu NCs dispersed in acetonitrile. Finally, the facet-dependent electrocatalytic activities of the shape-controlled Cu NCs are investigated to reveal the activities of the highly uniform and shape-pure Cu NCs in the methanol oxidation reaction.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000691675700001	34468086

Catalysis Science & Technology				8	22			5782	93		10.1039/c8cy01467a				21 Nov. 2018	2018	In this study, three alpha-Fe2O3 crystallites of regular morphology (truncated hexagonal bipyramid, quasi cubic, and hexagonal plate) were prepared in a controllable manner. Based on the (HR)TEM and SEM characterizations, the exposed crystal facets of three alpha-Fe2O3 crystallites, namely {113}, {214}, {104}, {110}, {012}, and {001}, were carefully identified. Au nanoparticles of ca. 2.0 nm with a narrow particle size distribution were essentially monodispersed on the three alpha-Fe2O3 substrates through a controlled deposition strategy. In such a way, the Au/alpha-Fe2O3 interfacial structures with structurally defined oxide substrates and nearly identical Au particle size and morphology have been obtained. The systems allowed us to compare in depth the behaviors of distinct surfaces/interfaces in CO oxidation. The characterization including O2/surface hydroxyl-TPD, CO-TPSR, and in situ FTIR clarified the role of the surface oxygen/hydroxyl species in developing crucial intermediates on distinct interfaces. The results demonstrated that the evolution of different intermediates (CO32- and HCO2-) was directly controlled by interfacial features, i.e., the weakly adsorbed oxygen and surface hydroxyl species as well as the specific Au-Fe2O3 boundary structure, which meaningfully determined CO activation and conversion to CO2. The present study provided new insights into the significance of Au/alpha-Fe2O3 interfacial structures governing the evolution of reaction intermediates in CO oxidation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2044-4753			INSPEC:18950676

Yet cost and high reaction overpotentials limit widespread implementation. Here, an electrolysis cell architecture that uses dissimilar electrolytes is shown to minimize the kinetic and thermodynamic considerations ascribed to electrolysis. The use of multiple monopolar ion exchange membranes (anion and cation selective) and multiple chambers (anolyte, catholyte, middle) allows stable electrolysis operation while a pH gradient is maintained across the electrolysis cell. This reduced the hydrogen and oxygen evolution onset potential by 0.65 +/- 0.03 and 0.62 +/- 0.01V, resulting in a whole cell onset potential for water splitting of 0.79 +/- 0.02V. The reduced onset potential was demonstrated for >15h of operation under fixed current density, resulting in a decrease in energy consumption by 56% when compared to similar pH electrolysis cells.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000407591200009

Herein, a hybrid of interpenetrating metallic Co and spinel Co3O4 "Janus" nanoparticles stitched in porous graphitized shells (Co/Co3O4@PGS) is synthesized via ionic exchange and redox between Co2+ and 2D metal-organic-framework nanosheets. This strategy is proven to effectively establish highways for the transfer of electrons and reactants within the hybrid through interfacial engineering. Specifically, the phase interpenetration of mixed Co species and encapsulating porous graphitized shells provides an optimal charge/mass transport environment. Furthermore, the defect-rich interfaces act as atomic-traps to achieve exceptional adsorption capability for oxygen reactants. Finally, robust coupling between Co and N through intimate covalent bonds prohibits the detachment of nanoparticles. As a result, Co/Co3O4@PGS outperforms state-of-the-art noble-metal catalysts with a positive half-wave potential of 0.89 V for ORR and a low potential of 1.58 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER. In a practical demonstration, ultrastable cyclability with a record lifetime of over 800 h at 10 mA cm(-2) is achieved by Zn-air batteries with Co/Co3O4@PGS within the rechargeable air electrode.									177	13	0	0	21	0	177			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000434031400007

Herein, we propose a facile and effective polymerization-pyrolysis-selenization (PPS) strategy for in-situ synthesis of N-doped carbon nanosnakes (NCNSs) encapsulated Fe-doped CoSe nanoparticles (NPs) derived from predesigned trimetallic Zn/Fe/Co polyphthalocyanine conjugated polymer networks. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between the regulation of Fe atoms and CoSe NPs as well as the confinement effect of in situ formed porous conductive carbon nanosnakes, the FeCoSe@NCNSs catalyst exhibited the excellent electrocatalytic activity for HER with small overpotentials (142 and 99 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH) and OER (320 mV in 1 M KOH) at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Particularly, it also can be used as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst with a cell voltage of 1.66 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)& nbsp;and superior stability for overall water splitting. Density functional theory study reveals that the doping of Fe atoms on CoSe enhanced the splitting and delocalization of metal -d orbitals close Fermi level, and modifies the distribution of Se -p orbitals close Fermi level, which improved the flexibility of electron donor-acceptor system and the hydrogen adsorption free energy change on metal-metal bridge sites in FeCoSe@NCNSs. Additionally, beneficial from the accepting of Fe-Se bridge site, the overpotential of OER which following intramolecular oxygen coupling mechanism is also decreased, thus accelerating the electrocatalytic performance. This work presents a novel strategy to regulate the activity and stability of transition metal selenides and facilitating the rational design of bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting applications.

J	Wang Xuan; Ye Qiang							王瑄; 叶强	The aggravation of side reactions caused by insufficient localized liquid supply in an all-vanadium redox flow battery stack			全钒液流电池电堆局部供液不足导致副反应加剧的现象				储能科学与技术	Energy Storage Science and Technology				11	5			1455	1467	2095-4239(2022)11:5<1455:QFYLDC>2.0.TX;2-J					2022	2022	In an operating all-vanadium redox flow battery stack, uneven electrolyte flow through each individual electrode is common, if not inevitable. Moreover, localized insufficiencies of liquid supply may become severe in a long-term operation, which not only directly affects overall stack performance, but also exacerbates harmful side reactions (including oxygen evolution, hydrogen evolution, and carbon corrosion). These reactions may in turn lead to blockages and increased resistance. This paper reports a model-based quantitative study of an all-vanadium redox flow battery stack under conditions of local liquid supply shortage. A two-dimensional steady-state simulation was carried out for charge/discharge under galvanostatic operation, focusing on the impact of local fluid supply deficiency on electrode potential and side reactions. The results show that decreased flow rate in one or several electrodes has little effect on the overall voltage of the stack, but that it does cause local sharp changes in current and ion concentrations inside the electrodes. It may also lead to an ultrahigh potential gradient, causing seriously deviation of the potential from its normal value. This in turn reduces the uniformity of distribution of the main reaction and intensifies the progress of side reactions on the electrode surface, potentially compromising the energy efficiency and safety of the stacks. Since the rate of side reactions also depends on the material properties of the electrode, this paper provides qualitative conclusions based on representative working conditions. These conclusions allow general guidance to be suggested for the design and testing of flow battery stacks.			在全钒液流电池电堆的实际运行中,并联供液的不同电极间可能会出现流量不均的问题,长期运行可能会造成电堆内部局部供液不足,不仅对电堆整体性能直接造成影响,还会加剧有害副反应(析氧反应、析氢反应、碳腐蚀反应等),进而导致阻塞加重、内阻增大。为了定量研究局部供液不足条件下液流电池电堆的表现,本工作建立全钒液流电池电堆模型,针对恒流充放电的运行工况进行了二维稳态仿真,着重研究了局部供液不足对电位以及副反应的影响。结果表明电堆中一片或几片电极的流量降低虽然对电堆整体电压影响较小,但会引发电极内部出现电流和离子浓度的局部急剧变化以及超高的电位梯度,使电位严重偏离正常值,不但降低主反应分布的均匀性而且加剧电极表面副反应的进行,对电池的安全、高效运行造成威胁。由于副反应的速率同时受电极材料性质的影响,本文旨在以一种具有代表性的工况得出定性的结论,为电堆设计和检测提供指导。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-4239			CSCD:7238224

These features include fine structure in the hydrogen adsorption region between 0.18 < V vs. RHE < 0.36 V vs. RHE consisting of two peaks, an asymptotic decrease at potentials greater than 0.36 V vs. RHE, and a hysteresis above 0.1 V vs. RHE which corresponded to a decrease in the cathodic scan current by up to 50% of the anodic scan. These features are examined as a function of hydrogen and proton concentration, anion type and concentration, potential scan limit, and temperature. We provide an analytical solution to the Heyrovsky-Volmer equation and use it to analyse our results. Using this model we are able to extract catalytic properties (without mass transport corrections; a possible source of error) by simultaneously fitting the model to HOR curves in a variety of conditions including temperature, hydrogen partial pressure and anion/H+ concentration. Using our model we are able to rationalise the pH and hydrogen concentration dependence of the hydrogen reaction. This model may be useful in application to fuel cell and electrolyser simulation studies. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The results show that under the condition of ignoring the temperature change, hydrostatic pressure can change the partial molar volume and activity of metal and environmental components, and then affect the equilibrium potential and exchange current density of each electrode reaction in the corrosion process. With the increase of hydrostatic pressure, the equilibrium potential of anodic dissolution reaction of Fe, Al and Zn decreases, and the exchange current density decreases. Furthermore, it increases the equilibrium potential and decreases the exchange current density of cathodic reduction of dissolved oxygen, while it decreases equilibrium potential and increases the exchange current density of cathode hydrogen evolution reaction. Correspondingly, the corrosion potential and corrosion current density of different corrosion cells also change under the effect of hydrostatic pressure. In addition, hydrostatic pressure will amplify the activity difference of different phases in metal, which will correspondingly lead to the increase of the difference of electrode reaction equilibrium potential and exchange current density of different phases in metal, and then affect the micro galvanic corrosion between different phases.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000809899400002

However, the powdery SACs were mostly evaluated at small current densities(typically<100 mA/cm(2)) with low electrode loading(typically<1.0 mg/cm(2)) due to the complex preparation process of the working electrode, the addition of polymeric binder that would decrease the electrical conductivity and bury the active sites. In contrast, self-supported single-atom film electrodes not only possess the merits of SACs, but also have the advantages of monolithic structure, such as the omission of polymeric and conductive additives, improved electrical conductivity, enhanced exposure of single-atom sites and adjustable morphology and porosity, making them highly promising to be applied in high-current-density catalytic reactions and high-energy/power-density batteries. In this review, the recent advances of self-supported film-based SACs in energy electrocatalysis are presented. Firstly. the advantages of self-supported film-based SACs are discussed. Subsequently, their synthetic approaches are summarized, including in situ preparation on a self-supported substrate, electrostatic spinning, self-assembly, chemical vapor deposition and solid phase diffusion. Then, the applications of self-supported film-based SACs in various energy-related electrocatalytic processes are introduced, including hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, H2O2, electrosynthcsis, zinc-air batteries, carbon dioxide reduction reaction and lithium sulfur batteries. Finally, the development direction of self-supported film-based SACs is prospected.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0251-0790			WOS:000819118700002

Also, the influence of various green capping agents (fruit juices and vegetable wastes) was studied on the formation of uniform particles. In the present work ultrasonic probe with 60 W/cm(2) intensity and 18 kHz frequency was used for sample synthesis. Further, catalytic behavior of these nanomaterials investigated in water splitting reaction for O-2 evolution by modifying the operational variables. The best catalytic behavior observed by those nanoparticles that indicated the smallest size and the most uniform morphology (Max amount of TON = 7.556). By utilizing the ultrasonic irradiation, the catalytic behavior of SrMnO3 nanoparticles improved (TON (ultrasonic bath) = 8.430, TON (ultrasonic probe) = 11.315).

Herein, we report a novel and highly efficient heteronanostructured OER system based on plasmonic Au nano particles (NPs) and ultrathin semiconductor-like Co/Ni-MOF nanosheets. The OER performance of the hybrid system can be tuned (by varying the AuNP sizes) and the oxidation current significantly enhanced to similar to 10-fold with incorporated AuNPs of similar to 20 nm. An onset overpotential (eta) of only 0.33 V was achieved under light illumination, which was much lower than the pure Ni/Co-MOF (0.48 V). Further analysis revealed the key role of the plasmonically induced hot holes (via electric and combined photoexcitation) in boosting the OER performance of the resulting system. The finding and the proposed concept provide a new insight for understanding the plasmon enhancements in catalysis and may open a new avenue to design MOF hetero-nanostructures with high performance for photoelectrocatalysis.									52	2	0	0	4	0	52			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000449239600056	30253643

Herein, we discuss the ion immobilized transition metal oxide nanoparticles embedded into the sulfur-doped carbon framework M-S-C (M = Mn, Co, and Mn-Co) via carbonization strategy, with high catalytic activity and stability. Due to ion exchange, the position of the metal ion is limited to the ion exchange site limiting the particle size. The synergistic effect between S-doped carbon and transitionmetal nanoparticles in the catalyst led to high bifuctionality for all three catalysts (Mn-S-C, Co-S-C, and Mn-Co-S-C). The overall oxygen electrode activities (Delta E = E-j=10 - E-1/2) for Mn-S-C, Co-S-C, Mn-Co-S-C, S-C, and Pt/C are 0.85, 0.81, 0.83, 1.1, and 1.03 V, respectively, for bifunctionality and are smaller than most of the precious and nonprecious metal catalysts reported in literature. OER (10 mA cm(-2)) and ORR (from onset potential) overpotentials for Mn-S-C, Co-S-C, Mn-Co-S-C, and S-C are (460 mV, 290 mV), (360 mV, 350 mV), (410 mV, 330 mV), and (510 mV, 420 mV), respectively. Among the synthesized catalysts, Mn-S-C exhibited higher ORR activity (Mn-S-C > Mn-Co-S-C > Co-S-C) and Co-S-C exhibited better OER activity (Co-S-C > Mn-Co-S-C > Mn-S-C). Hence, optimized actvity for both ORR and OER is achieved by Co-S-C catalyst. This potential bifunctional catalyst, when employed as an electrode material for rechargeable zinc-air battery, exhibited effective bifunctionality for catalyzing both ORR and OER with significantly higher energy efficiency, reduced voltage polarization, and improved cyclic stability up to 100 cycles at discharge current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The improved catalytic activity arises from favorable factors such as particle size, homogeneous dispersion of metal nanoparticles on carbon framework, and synergistic effect of sulfur and metal oxides.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2574-0962			WOS:000500038900014

However, its broad employment has been inhibited by costly catalysts and low energy conversion efficiency, mainly due to the sluggish anodic half reaction, the O-2 evolution reaction (OER), whose product O-2 is not of significant value. Herein, we report an efficient strategy to replace OER with a thermodynamically more favorable reaction, the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), catalyzed by 3D Ni2P nanoparticle arrays on nickel foam (Ni(2)PNPA/NF). HMF is one of the primary dehydration intermediates of raw biomass and FDCA is of many industrial applications. As a bifunctional electrocatalyst, Ni(2)PNPA/NF is not only active for HMF oxidation but also competent for H-2 evolution. In fact, a two-electrode electrolyzer employing Ni2P NPA/NF for simultaneous H-2 and FDCA production required a voltage at least 200 mV smaller compared with pure water splitting to achieve the same current density, as well as exhibiting robust stability and nearly unity Faradaic efficiencies.									299	14	0	0	17	0	304			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000383373000015	27417546

Herein, in order to obtain the electrode with high-performance water splitting and non-enzymatic glucose detection, the commercial graphite sheet (GS) with excellent durability and electroconductivity was used as substrate material, and the non-noble ternary component Ni-Co-P catalyst with hierarchical architecture was fabricated on GS via a co-electrodeposition. The catalyst only required low overpotentials of 44.6, 76.5 and 49 mV to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) alongside with the smaller Tafel slopes of 39.2, 44.8 and 112 mV dec(-1) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1.0 M KOH, 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M PBS solution, respectively. For oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the catalyst demonstrated a low overpotential of 304 mV to achieve the current density of 20 mA cm(-2) with excellent Tafel slope of 89.8 mV dec(-1) in alkaline solution. Furthermore, the Ni-Co-P/GS electrode serving as non-enzymatic glucose sensor exhibited the superior electrocatalytic activity with an ultrahigh sensitivity of 7400 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2), low detection limit of 0.425 mu M (S/N = 3), and wide linear range (1-1200 mu M).									4	1	0	0	1	0	5			1002-0071	1745-5391		WOS:000579857400003

Herein, a facile and faster nickelo-sulfurization of DNA in ambient conditions has been developed that resulted in NiS anchored wirelike assemblies of DNA. The effect of DNA concentration on material stability and electrocatalytic activity was studied, and it was found that, with DNA to Ni2+ ratios of 0.048 and 0.072 M, the NiS anchored DNA colloidal solutions were stable. In addition, it was found that NiS(0.048) with a relatively lower DNA concentration showed better oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity than NiS(0.072). Overpotentials of 352 and 401 mV were required by NiS(0.048) and NiS(0.072) to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) even with an ultralow quantity of NiS(0.0123 mg cm(-2)) in both. The same trend was reflected in the Tafel slopes of NiS(0.048) and NiS(0.072) which showed 58.6 and 112.4 mV dec(-1) indicating that the optimum ratio for better OER activity is 0.048. In this study, DNA plays a versatile role such as acting as a stabilizer, scaffold, and a microstructural stage for NiS in solution. Moreover, DNA also acts as an efficient binder and as a conductor of both ions and electrons in its OER activity trend. The proposed method can be used for preparing stable colloids of other metal sulfide based nano-electro-catalysts and can directly be employed for water oxidation in alkaline conditions.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2168-0485			WOS:000431927500122

Nevertheless, conventional powder samples, mixed with polymer binders and immobilized on a matrix, suffer from the limited specific surface area and poor conductivity. Herein, a carbon fiber paper (CFP)-assisted strategy is presented to mediate vertical in situ growth and assembly of NiCo-LDH nanoplates, and their catalytic activities as binder-free high-active electrocatalysts for water oxidation were investigated. The CFP is capable of modulating the assembly of NiCo-LDH nanoplates, yielding the vertically oriented nanoarrays on CFP. The as-made hybrids indicate a dramatically increased catalytic activity and long-term stability towards OER in comparison to that of micro-sized LDHs spheres derived from the self-assembly of LDHs nanoplates. A relatively low over potential of 307 mV is achieved at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 64 mV dec(-1) is delivered in basic medium. The vertically oriented LDHs nanoarrays featuring large specific surface areas, open structure and rich active sites, together with the highly conductive CFP substrate are synergistically responsible for the enhanced electrochemical performance.

The counterflow geometry provides a one-dimensional flow field along the stagnation point streamline which greatly simplifies the analysis of non-spherical particle growth. Flame analysis of multi-step chemical reactions of hydrogen/oxygen including both oxidation and hydrolysis of SiCl4 has been done to predict flame temperatures, concentrations of gas species and particle generation. The present prediction of flame temperatures was in good agreement with the previous experimental data. Two-dimensional aerosol dynamics in which both particle volume and surface area are independent variables has been then analyzed to obtain the evolution of non-spherical particles which has been compared with the previous experimental data. Several different models of coalescence of silica particles were studied; viscous flow sintering, atomistic diffusion sintering, fast sintering and hybrid sintering models. The use of hybrid sintering model yielded the best agreement with the previous experimental data. Since the collision cross section of non-spherical particles is larger than that of spherical particles having the same volume, coagulation of particles was obviously shown to be enhanced. The important role of axial particle diffusion has been identified in the counterflow diffusion flame. Bi-modal size distributions were obtained at some flame heights. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Bifunctional electrocatalysts made up of cheap and abundant elements and suitable for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are critically needed, yet their performance deserves substantial improvement. The catalytic activity could be improved by creating unsaturated defects, which so far has rarely been demonstrated. Here, we combine the effects of unsaturated sulfur vacancies and bi-elemental C and N doping in MoS2 nanosheets to achieve high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts. The new method to obtain C and N doped MoS2 at high temperature is presented. The obtained C-N-MoS2/CC-T catalysts with S unsaturated defect sites and Mo-N links exhibit high activity and improved electrical conductivity for both the HER and OER in alkaline media. Systematic experiments and density functional theory (DFT) analysis confirm that CN-doping exposes catalytically active sites and enhances water adsorption. The optimized C-N-MoS2/CC-700 catalyst exhibits low overpotentials of 90 and 230 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER and OER, respectively. Importantly, the porous C-N-MoS2/CC-700 nanosheets deliver low voltages of 1.58 V for the overall water splitting at 10 mA cm(-2) and robust operation for 30 h without any reduced activity. Such impressive performances are attributed to their unique structure with large specific surface area, abundant S unsaturated sites, Mo-N links, and shortened electron transfer paths. This partial defect filling by the bi-dopant incorporation approach is generic and is promising for a broad range of advanced energy materials.									11	1	0	0	0	0	12			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000686235900001	34473169

A key molecule interacting with these quasi two-dimensional materials (2DM) is water, and a photo(electro)chemical key reaction catalyzed by them, is water splitting into H-2 and O-2, with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as half reactions. The complexity of some C/N-based 2DM in contact with water raises special needs for their theoretical modelling, which in turn is needed for rational design of C/N-based catalysts. In this work, three classes of C/N-containing porous 2DM with varying pore sizes and C/N ratios, namely graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), C2N, and poly(heptazine imides) (PHI), are studied with various computational methods. We elucidate the performance of different models and model chemistries (the combination of electronic structure method and basis set) for water and water fragment adsorption in the low-coverage regime. Further, properties related to the photo(electro)chemical activity like electrochemical overpotentials, band gaps, and optical excitation energies are in our focus. Specifically, periodic models will be tested vs. cluster models, and density functional theory (DFT) vs. wavefunction theory (WFT). This work serves as a basis for a systematic study of trends for the photo(electro)chemical activity of C/N-containing layered materials as a function of water content, pore size and density.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000790847800001	35510618

The infrared imaging of isothermally treated fibre cross-sections reveals the radial distribution of specific functional groups (C N, C=N, CH2, CH and C=O) that forms the ladder polymer structure, the most critical stage in the precursor stabilization process. Apparently, it was found that the cyclization reaction of PAN polymer chains occurred at a faster rate in the core of the fibre during heating where it further selectively promoted the dehydrogenation reaction. On the other hand, the conversion of sp(3) to sp(2) hybridized carbon atoms was found to be higher around the skin layer compared to the core of the fibres, thus providing evidence for different cross-linking mechanisms in these regions. The simultaneous occurrence of a higher extent of cyclization and dehydrogenation reactions due to the excess heat developed in the core and a delay of oxygen diffusion in to the core of the fibres played a critical role in the polymer chain cross-linking in the skin and core regions that further led to the evolution of radial heterogeneity in the fibres. It was also found that the mechanical properties were built upon the structural transformations and the variation in the modulus across the fibre cross-section further confirmed the reaction mechanism.									26	3	0	0	0	0	27			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000399390300017

Semiempirical potentials were used to determine the solution energies of trivalent cation oil either A or B site of the perovskite structure. Density functional theory calculations were also performed to gain further insight into the redox properties of this material. Both approaches give a complete view of the way doping atoms will be inserted inside the BaSnO3 structure. For instance, we calculated with good precision the evolution of cell parameters with dopant nature and concentration. Then, by taking into account dopant vacancy interactions, we also show that the oxygen vacancy preferentially locates close to the dopant in the case of small size dopant while stays at the second neighbor position in the case of bigger dopant. These calculations also show that In and Y are the dopants; giving the most homogeneous energetic map for oxygen vacancy movements and might thus be anticipated as the best acceptor-like dopants for enhanced anion conduction properties. Finally, we calculated an oxygen ion migration activation energy of 0.65 eV.									32	0	0	0	0	0	32			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000271826100052

Inspired by this, we in situ deposited W-doped Ni3S2 nanoparticles modified with NiFeLa hydroxide on Ni foam (NF). Our work primarily concentrates on optimizing the dosage of W element and constructing open nanostructures with rich active sites. The internal W-doped Ni3S2 nanoparticles enable high conductivity, and the outer NiFeLa hydroxide nanosheets form more active sites, which help to monitor the electronic structure and generate synergistic effects. Both optimization of tungsten hexachloride dosage and epitaxial growth of NiFeLaOH nanosheets greatly ameliorate the surface active area, conductivity, and electronic structure of the hybrid nanomaterial. When directly applied to alkaline HER catalytic systems, the resulting catalyst presents favorable electrochemical performance, such as low HER overpotentials (67 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 330 mV at 552 mA cm(-2)). Remarkably, after a duration of 40 h, the catalytic activity presents pretty slight attenuation (amplification of similar to 15 mV for overpotential), which indicates its ultralong stability. This research introduces an effective method to tune electrocatalytic performance by doping W element into Ni3S2 and coupling with NiFeLa hydroxide.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2574-0970			WOS:000566778600113

Nonprecious CuNiMo ternary catalysts with superior activity and durability for the hydrogen evolution are electrodeposited. A wide range of compositions, from Cu and Ni as single metals to binary and ternary alloys, are tested to identify the composition range in which the intrinsic activity is enhanced. In particular, Cu44.4Ni46Mo9.6 exhibits superior electrochemical characteristics, comparable to those of Pt group metals, with a Tafel slope of 27.7 mV dec(-1) and an overpotential of 18 mV at -10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, during a long-term durability test (24 h at -10 mA cm(-2)), the overpotential only decays by a few millivolts owing to the modified electronic structure obtained by alloying. PEMWE with Cu44.4Ni46Mo9.6 cathode exhibits 266% higher activity than the average activity of recently reported non-Pt cathode-based PEMWEs at 1.9 Vcell without degradation of performance during 48 h operation. Thus, Cu44.4Ni46Mo9.6 is a promising catalyst for the costefficient PEMWE.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000685074000005

Herein, we synthesize Co2-xNixO2 (0 < x < 1.0) hexagonal nanosheets with different Co/Ni molar ratios via a facile coprecipitation process followed by calcination under an Ar atmosphere. Changing the Co/Ni molar ratios of the Co2-xNixO2 products is found to have a momentous influence on the microstructures, specific surface areas and electrocatalytic performances. At a Co/Ni molar ratio of 0.6, the Co1.4Ni0.6O2 nanosheet exhibits the largest specific surface area of 60.63 m(2) g(-1), the best OER with an onset overpotential of 278.5 mV, and HER of 72.8 mV as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. Meanwhile, the minimum Tafel slope is 113.6 mV dec(-1) for OER and 77.4 mV dec(-1) for HER. The Co1.4Ni0.6O2 nanosheet has excellent OER and HER activity at 0.1 mg cm(-2) trace loading. Moreover, we construct an overall water splitting cell using the Co1.4Ni0.6O2 bifunctional electrocatalyst in a two-electrode system to further demonstrate the practical application, which needs a cell voltage of 1.75 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits great long-term stability. These results provide an efficient strategy for the rational design of Co-based oxides towards bifunctional overall water electrocatalysts.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000537869500042	32363368

Particularly, the factors that dominate the catalytic properties of NiOx-based hybrids for HER have not been clearly demonstrated. Herein, a convenient protocol for the fabrication of NiOx@bamboo-like carbon nanotube hybrids (NiOx@BCNTs) is designed. The hybrids exhibit superb catalytic ability and considerable durability in alkaline solution. A benchmark HER current density of 10 mA cm(-2) has been achieved at an overpotential of similar to 79 mV. In combination with the experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, this for the first time definitely validates that the inherent high Ni-0 ratio and the Ni on the interface of Ni/NiO play a vital role in the outstanding catalytic performance. Especially, the Ni-0 on the interface of Ni/NiO performs superior activity for water splitting compared with that of bulk Ni-0. These conclusions provide guidance for the rational design of the future non-noble metallic catalysts.									144	8	0	0	7	0	145			1944-8244			WOS:000395494200051	28165222

A careful analysis of our current understanding of that reaction shows that such an enhancement is unlikely; in lack of reasonable alternatives we feel, however, that a reinvestigation of the Ne-Na cycle in the low-temperature regime is worthwhile.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			0004-637X			WOS:A1991GH07800030

In particular, the oxygen isotopic ratios are of particular interest because they are affected not only by nucleosynthesis but also by mixing processes, which are not very well-understood yet. This review is focused on the measurements via the Trojan Horse Method (THM) that have been carried out to investigate the low-energy cross sections of proton and neutron-induced reactions on O-17 as well as the proton-induced reaction on O-18, overcoming extrapolation procedures and enhancement effects due to electron screening. The (p,alpha) reactions induced on these oxygen isotopes are of paramount importance for the nucleosynthesis in a number of stellar sites, including red giants (RGs), asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, massive stars, and classical novae. In detail, the indirect measurement of the low-energy region of O-17(p,alpha)N-14 was performed. The strength of the narrow resonance at 65 keV was evaluated, and it was used to renormalize the corresponding resonance strength in the O-17+p radiative capture channel. The reaction rate was then evaluated for both the O-17(p,alpha)N-14 and the O-17(p,gamma)F-18 reactions, and significant differences of 30 and 20% with respect the literature data were found, respectively, in the temperature range relevant for RG, AGB, and massive stars nucleosynthesis. Regarding the O-18(p,alpha)N-15 reaction, the strength of the 20 keV resonance was extracted, which is the main contribution to the reaction rate for astrophysical applications. This approach has allowed us to improve the data accuracy of a factor 8.5, as it is based on the measured strength instead of educated guesses or spectroscopic measurements. Finally, the O-17(n,alpha)C-14 reaction was studied because of its role during the s-process nucleosynthesis as a possible neutron poison reaction. This study represents the extension of THM to resonant neutron-induced reactions. In this measurement, the subthreshold level centered at -7 keV in the center-of-mass system, corresponding to the 8.039 MeV O-18 excited level, was observed. Moreover, the THM measurements showed a clear agreement with the available direct measurements and the additional contribution of the 8.121 MeV O-18 level, strongly suppressed in direct measurements because of its l = 3 angular momentum. The contributions of those levels to the total reaction rate were than evaluated for future astrophysical applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2296-987X			WOS:000589337900001

In PEMFC, developing non-platinum based catalyst by understanding the catalytic activity for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is essential for energy storage/conversion. Herein, we report preparation of such a bi-functional and durable catalyst consists of palladium and nitrogen coordinated cobalt and its catalytic activity is discussed methodically. Palladium cobalt bimetallic alloy nanoparticles dispersed over graphitic carbon nitride (Pd-Co/gCN) serves as an efficient anode and cathode catalyst in proton exchange membrane fuel cell for energy conversion. Incorporation of cobalt with palladium in nitrogen rich support material optimally modifies the bond strength of palladium-hydrogen (Pd-H) complex and promotes HOR, results in significant improvement of overpotential at the anode whereas, the nitrogen coordinated cobalt predominantly enhances the ORR activity at the cathode in acidic medium. Effects of mass transfer on the kinetics of ORR were investigated with rotating disc electrode (RDE). The hydrodynamic voltammograms were investigated to determine the kinetic parameters using the Koutecky-Levich equation. Our study presents an experimental realization of unveiling a good power density with high fuel utilization efficiency in a single cell for electrochemical energy conversion with complete elimination of platinum.									28	2	0	0	2	0	28			0306-2619	1872-9118		WOS:000416300400004

Here, we report an iron/ nickel terephthalate coordination polymer on nickel form (NiFeCP/NF) as catalyst for OER, in which both coordinated and uncoordinated carboxylates were maintained after electrolysis. NiFeCP/NF exhibits outstanding electro-catalytic OER activity with a low overpotential of 188 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 KOH, with a small Tafel slope and excellent stability. The pH-independent OER activity of NiFeCP/NF on the reversible hydrogen electrode scale suggests that a concerted proton-coupled electron transfer (c-PET) process is the rate-determining step (RDS) during water oxidation. Deuterium kinetic isotope effects, proton inventory studies and atom-proton-transfer measurements indicate that the uncoordinated carboxylates are serving as the proton transfer relays, with a similar function as amino acid residues in photosystem II (PSII), accelerating the proton-transfer rate.									116	5	1	0	15	0	117			2041-1723			WOS:000494938800001	31699987

Furthermore, the destruction channels for this element are far from being well understood. About 23Na, its presence in Globular Clusters along with the well-known anticorrelation with oxygen, underline that this element has been produced in previous generations of stars: in particular, intermediate-mass AGB stars are one of the possible candidates for its production. For this reason we studied the 19F(alpha,p)22Ne and 23Na(p, alpha)20Ne reactions in the energy range of relevance for astrophysics via the Trojan Horse Method (THM), using the three-body reactions 6Li(19F, p22Ne)d and 23Na (d, pn)20Ne.

To explore the effect of ZrO2 content on the surface properties and electrochemical behavior of electrodes, we performed physical characterizations and electrochemical measurements. The obtained results revealed that the binary oxide coating was composed of rutile IrO2, amorphous ZrO2, and an IrO2-ZrO2 solid solution. The IrO2-ZrO2 binary oxide coatings exhibited cracked structures with flat regions. A slight incorporation of ZrO2 promoted the crystallization of the active component IrO2. However, the crystallization of IrO2 was hindered when the added ZrO2 content was greater than 30at%. The appropriate incorporation of ZrO2 enhanced the electrocatalytic performance of the pure IrO2 coating. The Ti/70at%IrO2-30at%ZrO2 electrode, with its large active surface area, improved electrocatalytic activity, long service lifetime, and especially, lower cost, is the most effective for promoting oxygen evolution in sulfuric acid solution.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			1674-4799	1869-103X		WOS:000511937600014

The libraries were subsequently annealed at 700-1000 degrees C to induce structural and compositional changes. Using grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, structural changes were followed as a function of annealing temperature. At temperatures above 700 degrees C, the previously homogeneous and amorphous thin films became a heterogeneous mixture of (partially) graphitized nitrogen-containing carbon and either Fe3C or beta-Co. The onset of this transformation is accompanied by a rapid decrease in N content and occurs as a function of both transition metal content and temperature. Catalytic activity for oxygen reduction is at its maximum partway through this transformation.

The former corresponds to Rh(OH)(3) and the latter to RhO(OH); OC2 occurs in submonolayer thicknesses. The OC1 state reaches a limit of 1980 mu C cm(-2) which is equivalent to three monolayers (ML) of Rh(OH)(3). The kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at Rh electrodes, covered with thin films of Rh(OH)(3), are evaluated from current density vs. time (i vs. t(p)) transients and by determining Tafel relations. At E(p) greater than or equal to 2.00 V, the i vs. t(p) transients show changes in the OER kinetics, as the predominant electrode process, and reveal an initial drop of the current density which subsequently levels off. The Tafel plots reveal two linear regions with slopes of 90 mV at low overpotentials, eta, and 120 mV at high eta, with a transition potential, E(tr), at 1.73 V. The exchange current densities expressed as log i(o) and determined from the linear components of Tafel plots are -9.4 A cm(-2) for low eta and -7.3 A cm(-2) for high eta. At low eta, electron resonance tunnelling is the rate-determining step in the OER whereas at high eta the process is limited by the discharge of H2O to OH.									28	1	0	0	0	0	29			0956-5000			WOS:A1994PZ44300012

Herein, we present surface-modified NiCo2O4 nanowires (NWs) with rich defects as a highly efficient overall water splitting electrocatalyst in alkaline media, where the surface modification is accomplished using organic ligands. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that the increase in the Co2+/Co3+ ratio is responsible for the excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance of the surface- modified NiCo2O4 NWs. As expected, benefiting from the organic ligand-dominated surface modification, the optimized NiCo2O4 NWs can display an overpotential of only 83 mV for the HER and 280 mV for the OER, with a current density of 10 mA(.)cm(-2) in 1.0 mol(.)L(-1) KOH solution. More importantly, the NiCo2O4 NWs surface-modified using organic ligands exhibit outstanding performance for overall water splitting, with a voltage of 2.1 V and current density of 100 mA(.)cm(-2), and also maintain their activity for at least 15 h. The present work highlights the importance of increasing the content of Co2+ in the spinel structure of NiCo2O4 NWs for enhancing their performance in overall water splitting.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			1000-6818			WOS:000849637800005

Herein, Fe-N codoped carbon (FeNC) nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized via facile pyrolysis of precursor ZIF-8 (Fe/Zn) nanoparticles, and their potential applications in tumor therapy were assessed in this investigation both in vitro and in vivo. After PAA (sodium polyacrylate) modification, the FeNC@PAA nanoparticles were able to initiate a Fe-based Fenton-like reaction to generate center dot OH and O-2 for chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and O-2 evolution. Meanwhile, the porphyrin-like metal center in the FeNC@PAA nanoparticles could be used as a photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of tumors, which could be enhanced by O-2 generated in CDT. Furthermore, the FeNC@PAA nanoparticles were also found to be effective in photothermal therapy (PTT) with a photothermal conversion efficiency of 29.15%, owing to a high absorbance in the near-infrared region (NIR). In conclusion, the synthesized FeNC@PAA nanoparticles exhibited promising applications in O-2 evolution and CDT/PDT/PTT synergistic treatment of tumors.									23	2	0	0	6	0	23			1043-1802	1520-4812		WOS:000621366800011	33543921

Herein, bimetallic oxides anchored to three-dimensional (3D) porous conductive nickel foam (NF) are constructed using a simplein situhydrothermal method for efficient overall water splitting. The vertically aligned Mn3O4/Fe(2)O(3)heterojunction nanosheets have synergy between hierarchical metal oxides and heterogeneous interface, and show excellent performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an alkaline environment. By adjusting the molar ratio of Fe : Mn, the morphology, composition and electronic structure of MnFeO-NF-xcomposites (xrepresents the ratio of Fe : Mn) can be adjusted to exhibit diverse catalytic activities. In particular, MnFeO-NF-0.4 (0.4 indicates the Fe : Mn ratio of 0.4 : 1) and MnFeO-NF-0.8 display outstanding performance with ultralow overpotentials of 157 mV for the OER and 64 mV for the HER to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, MnFeO-NF-0.4 and MnFeO-NF-0.8 are assembled into a water splitting electrolyzer, which can reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)with a low voltage of 1.59 V. Interestingly, Mn-M (M = Co, Ni, and Mo) products can be obtained easily by using different metal salts, indicating the universality of the current one-pot hydrothermal method.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000578100000042	32996530

Herein, a series of FexP/biochar composites were successfully prepared through a simple pyrolysis process. Iron species (FeOOH) was pre-loaded on the surface of phosphorus-containing biomass (yeast), which was subsequently converted to FexP/biochar with the assistance of in-situ produced reducing gases (H-2, CO, PH3, etc.). When applied for typical antibiotic pollutant (sulfamethoxazole, SMX) removal, the optimal material (FexP/BC-5) performed well with a 99% removal efficiency in 30 min via the synergistic effects of adsorption and degradation by activation of dissolved oxygen (DO). Reactive oxygen species, including H2O2, center dot OH, center dot O-2(-) and O-1(2), were generated in FexP/BC-5/DO system by charge transfer and Fenton-like reaction. FexP/BC-5 was applicable in a broad pH range from 3.0 to 9.0 and exhibited good reusability in five recycle runs after regeneration. Moreover, the primary reactions in SMX degradation process were discussed based on identified intermediates by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). This work not only develops a simple approach to construct iron phosphides/biochar using green and sustainable phosphorus source but also bring new insights for environmental pollutants remediation by oxygen activation.									20	1	0	0	10	0	21			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000551969200124

The present study demonstrates the application of a p-n junction to particulate metal selenides to enhance photocatalytic Z-scheme overall water splitting (OWS). The constructed p-n junction of CdS-(ZnSe)(0.5)(CuGa2.5Se4.25)(0.5) significantly boosted charge separation. A thin TiO2 coating layer also was introduced to inhibit photocorrosion of CdS and suppress the backward reaction of water formation from hydrogen and oxygen. By employing Pt-loaded TiO2/CdS-(ZnSe)(0.5)(CuGa2.5Se4.25)(0.5) as a hydrogen evolution photocatalyst (HEP), we assembled a Z-scheme OWS system, together with BiVO4:Mo and Au as an oxygen evolution photocatalyst and electron mediator, respectively. An apparent quantum yield of 1.5% at 420 nm was achieved, which is by far the highest among reported particulate photocatalytic Z-scheme OWS systems with metal sulfides/selenides as HEPs. The present work demonstrates that a well-tailored p-n junction structure is effective for promoting charge separation in photocatalysis and opens new pathways for the development of efficient artificial photosynthesis systems involving narrow bandgap photocatalysts.									31	1	0	0	5	0	31			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000677544800022	34235922

Similarly, the adsorption of C6H10O on clean Ag(110) was investigated. On the clean Ag(110) surface C6H11OH desorbs molecularly from the saturated monolayer at 250 K with an activation energy, E(a), of 64 kJ/mol assuming a preexponential factor, nu, of 10(13) s-1, and from a multilayer state at 195 K with an activation energy of 65 kJ/mol. C6H10O desorbed molecularly from the monolayer at 230 K with E(a) = 60.0 +/- 3.9 kJ/mol and nu = 10(13.3 +/- 0.8) s-1, and from a multilayer state at 165 K with an activation energy of 58 kJ/mol. On the partially oxidized Ag(110) surface, in addition to forming molecular multilayer and monolayer states, C6H11OH reacts with atomic oxygen selectively to form adsorbed cyclohexoxy (C6H11O(a)) and H2O. Selectivity was maximized with oxygen coverages below 0.25 monolayer and saturation C6H11OH exposures.

In this study, highly active self-supporting electrodes with excellent durability were designed and developed for high-performance overall water splitting at a high current density. First, a colloid-based dip-coating method using porous carbon cloth (PCC) was introduced to obtain uniformly coated Ni and Fe nanoparticles on a conductive substrate. Then, the desired phase transitions of Ni and Fe to Ni2P and FeP, respectively, proceeded by thermal phosphidation at optimum temperature. The uniformly interconnected Ni2P layers on the PCC substrate (Ni2P@PCC) and FeP layers on the PCC substrate (FeP@PCC) exhibited outstanding oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, respectively. When each electrode was adopted as an anode and a cathode for the overall water splitting cell, excellent performance was achieved, with a low operational voltage of 1.76 V and high durability for 100 hours at a high current density of 50 mA cm(-2).									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000561864800001

This 2D, metal-free nanohybrid exhibited much higher catalytic activity than most reported metal-free catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and even state-of-the-art Ir- and Ru-based catalysts because the high content of graphitic N greatly increased the number of OER-active sites, the pristine graphene significantly promoted the OER activity of the C sites adjacent to the graphitic N atoms, and N-doped graphitic carbon remarkably enhanced the charge-transfer rate. This work not only creates a facile and economical approach to controllably fabricate pristine-graphene-supported carbon with a high N-doping level for the development of highly efficient metal-free OER catalysts but also provides insight into the mechanisms for both the in situ self-assembly and the high OER catalytic activity of G@NC.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000493029700001	31589802

It is showed that. the Whole electrolysis processes of these anodes can be divided into three stages consisting of 'active', 'stable' and 'de-active' regions. In the first two stages, the dissolution of coated oxides is dominated (with IrO2 component preferential loss) which results in decreasing of apparent Current for oxygen evolution and voltammetric charge. It is found that, in these two stages, the preferential orientations of (1 1 0 ) and (1 0 1) planes in IrO2 rutile decreases with electrolysis time. and that of (0 0 2) plane increases, while the preferential orientations remain to be stabilized in the 'de-active' region. Therefore, the loss mechanism of catalyst coatings in this region is changed. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurernent shows a slight increase in reaction resistance (R-ct) of oxide catalysts for oxygen evolution in the 'de-active' region, while a sharp rise in totally physical impedance of the whole anode. According to the experimental results, a degradation mechanism of the Ti based anodes has been proposed by degradation of Ti/catalyst layer interface resulting from the dissolution and anodic oxidation of metal base alternatively.

The doped Co3O4 showed a unique structural morphology evolution upon controlling the doping elements and the doping ratio of the cations. For the codoped samples, the novel rhombus-shaped Co3O4 nanosheets doped with Zn2+ and Ni2+ (concentration ratio of 1:2) exhibited the optimal electrocatalytic performance. The sample showed a current density of 165 mA cm(-2) at 1.75 V, approximately 1.6 and 4 times higher than that of samples doped with Zn2+ and Ni2+ at a concentration ratio of 1:1 and 1:3. The unique architecture and its corresponding modified physical properties, such as high active-site density created by codoping, large structural porosity, and high roughness, are together responsible to its superior performance. For codoped Co3O4 nanostructures, Zn2+ facilitates the creation of Co cations in their high oxidation state as active centers, while Ni2+ contributed to the new active sites with lower activation energy. The synergistic effect of Zn2+ and Ni2+ doping can explain the improved physicochemical properties of codoped Co3O4 nanostructures.									42	3	0	0	2	0	43			1944-8244			WOS:000362628900018	26383787

The deposition of loadings of 10 mg cm(-2) was obtained on iron substrates in slightly alkaline solutions in the presence of dissolved nickel and/or cobalt sulphate. For nickel and Co58Ni42 coatings, potential cycling resulted in an improvement in the OER and the presence of one dominant couple (i.e., NiOOH/Ni(OH2)) on the potentiodynamic traces. In addition, the finer coating structure of the Co58Ni42 coatings, the greater the improvement in the OER with potential cycling. For the latter alloy, the coating structure was modified by applying a cathodic current density ranging from 0.005 to 0.5 A cm(-2) during electrodeposition. For cobalt coatings, a third oxidation peak (Co(OH)(2)-->CoOOH) with its related reduction peak (CoOOH-->Co(OH)(2)) appeared on the voltammograms as the potential was cycled; a lowering of the OER electrocatalytic activity was induced by potential cycling.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0254-0584			WOS:A1993MH48500012

However, there have been few reports exhibiting satisfactory activity and durability under high current density (up to 1000 mA cm(-2)), which are significant for the practical production of water splitting. Herein, a novel electrocatalyst, CuS-Ni3S2, in situ grown from porous CuNi alloy supported on nickel foam (CuS-Ni3S2/CuNi/NF) was obtained via a facile two-step method, and it has achieved excellent OER performance in alkaline solution even under high current density. The electrocatalyst only needed low overpotentials of 337, 444 and 510 mV to reach the very high current densities of 100, 500, and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively, and it presented excellent durability at a relatively high current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for 15 h. Despite the current density being normalized by the catalytic electrode's geometrical area, both the mass activity and turnover frequency (TOF) for each active site showed the superior catalytic activity of CuS-Ni3S2/CuNi/NF. With the assistance of theoretical calculations, the participation of CuS was demonstrated to contribute to the excellent OER performance, providing a promising composition for designing and synthesizing novel OER catalysts.									24	2	0	0	0	0	25			2052-1553			WOS:000457275000031

Compared with the aqueous system, the separation of reductive potential between the Ni(II) and Fe(II) was significantly decreased in this IL. The electrodeposition of Ni-Fe alloys was thus easily achieved using constant-potential electrolysis at copper substrate. No anomalous electrodeposition of Ni-Fe, which is common in aqueous system, was observed in this IL, resulting in the easy control of alloy compositions. The electronic spectra indicated that the coordinations of Ni(II) related to the precursors used in the IL, and the surface morphology of the Ni-Fe alloys was affected by the precursors as well as the electrodepositing potentials. Crystalline Ni and Ni-Fe were obtained from this system but crystalline Fe was only obtained at high temperature. The obtained Ni-Fe alloys were converted to the corresponding metal oxides/hydroxides via electrochemical oxidation in alkaline solution, and the linear scan voltammetric study indicated that these Ni-Fe alloys are potential substitutes for Pt as electrocatalysts of oxygen evolution reaction.

Herein, FeS2 nanoparticles were anchored on the surface of MXene through a simple adsorption-growth route (FeS2@MXene). By virtue of the large active surface area of FeS2 and its robust interfacial interaction with conductive and hydrophilic MXene nanosheets, the obtained FeS2@MXene composite can accelerate the transfer of mass/charge and facilitate contact between water molecules and reactive sites of FeS2. Specifically, MXene as a support material can not only alter the electrophilicity of the active centers of FeS2 through modulating the electron density but also prevent the aggregation of FeS2, thereby promoting activity and stability. The optimized FeS2@MXene delivers a 10 mA cm(-2) current density at overpotentials of 87 and 240 mV in alkaline solution for the HER and OER, respectively, which is comparable with reported transition metal sulfide (TMS) based catalysts. More importantly, in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that the FeOOH generated during the OER process as a actual active species enhances the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. This work paves a new way for the interface engineering of TMS-based electrocatalysts towards water splitting.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2052-1553			WOS:000745814900001

In this paper, a facile paradigm for designing photosensitizer-free difunctional catalysts from old fashioned cubic MOFs as Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) is presented. The as-prepared Co(OH)(2)-modified CuO (Co(OH)(2)/CuO) nanoparticles displayed robust catalytic efficiency (3567 mol h(-1) g(-1)) toward visible-light-driven water oxidation reaction (WOR). Intriguingly, insights into the WOR pathway indicated that the Co(OH)(2)/CuO nanoparticles could serve as both water oxidation catalysts and visible light absorption centers and they still showed photocatalytic performance under monochromatic light at 765 nm and maintained 64.2% oxygen evolution compared to the case with light cutting off at 420 nm. The Co(OH)(2)/CuO nanoparticles were shown to be quite stable in the reaction system via characterizing their properties before and after the reactions. While the synergetic effect between Co(OH)(2) and the CuO clusters was found to be key to the abnormal photocatalytic activity of this catalyst in the complicated WOR process. We hope that this contribution will serve as a useful template for other researchers to design new transition metal catalysts for WOR.									3	1	0	0	1	0	3			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000453549100006

However, the main challenges associated with the current 3D porous metals are the inability to control pore sizes, pore geometry, and pore distribution, which generally result in low electrochemical surface areas and electronic conductivity, and poor mechanical properties. Hence to effectively utilize 3D porous metals as a catalyst, a deliberate structural design is highly desirable. Herein, 3D cellular stainless steel was designed and directly printed via a selective laser melting technique. This rational 3D cellular design exhibits high mechanical strength, electronic conductivity, and electrochemical surface area, which are essential components towards efficient interconnected ion/electron/bubble transport pathways. The obtained 3D electrode exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activities for the oxygen evolution reaction with a low overpotential of ca. 302 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). After electrochemical activation, the overpotential decreased to 270 mV due to the formation of nickel-iron oxyhydroxides on the electrode surface. In addition to the enhanced catalytic performance, the cellular stainless steel electrodes exhibited excellent electrochemical corrosion resistance in alkaline electrolytes and other harsh electrolytes such as artificial seawater.									47	2	0	0	5	0	48			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000408592900050

Herein, we report nickel sulfide nanocrystals (NCs) as excellent catalysts for electrochemical and solar-driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen evolution. Two polymorphic NiS and NiS1.97 NCs were synthesized with a controlled composition, and the NiS NCs showed higher electrocatalytic activity than the NiS1.97 NCs toward the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH. Photocathodes were fabricated by growing the NiS and NiS1.97 NCs directly onto Si nanowire (NW) arrays. The deposition of NiS NCs results in excellent PEC performance in both acid and alkaline electroytes; the photocurrent is 10 mA cm(-2) (at 0 V vs. RHE) and the onset potential is 0.2 V. In contrast, the Si-NiS1.97 photocathode exhibits much lower photocurrent and less stability. Detailed structure analysis using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that the NiS is more metallic than the NiS1.97 and retains the same electronic structures during the catalytic reaction. The high catalytic activity of metallic NiS NCs should be the main cause of this enhanced PEC performance, promising efficient water-splitting Si-based PEC cells.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000519972600034

Inspired by intrinsic defects (vacancies, edges and dislocation) on graphene showing activity towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), here, two commonly exposed surfaces of diamond carbon, i.e., C (111) & C(110), were calculated for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) by the density functional theory (DFT) method, and calculations show that, compared with C(110), C(111) could be highly promising towards eNRR with a low over-potential (eta) of 0.57 V (Delta G(max) = 0.73 eV, eta = 0.57 V), which are distinctly less than that (Delta G(max) = 1.08 eV, eta = 0.92 V) of flat benchmark Ru(0001) catalysts. Importantly, these two surfaces are shown to exhibit the suppression of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This work is the first reported indication that the low-coordinated carbons (LCCs) on sp(3)-hybridized diamond-carbon framework are active for eNRR, which gives a brand-new direction of designing/synthesizing sp3-configured diamond-carbon-composited catalysts for eNRR.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0925-9635	1879-0062		WOS:000612812500002

The development of a highly active and stable electrode for water oxidation at a low price is greatly challenging. Here, we report a self-supported oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrode with a 3D porous Ni foam (NF) as a core and a dense layer of amorphous phosphorus-doped Ni hydroxide (Ni-OH/P) film as a shell. This facilely fabricated 3D core-shell structured electrode with directly grown active materials offered improved activity and prolonged stability for OER. It required an overpotential of 490 mV to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm(-2); it showed a small Tafel slope at 87 mV dec(-1) and sustained elongated electrolysis at 100 mA cm(-2) for 100 h. The NiOOH shell was in situ formed on the surface of the Ni-OH/P film. Then, a new core-shell structured film was constructed. The synergetic effects of the newly formed crystalline NiOOH shell and amorphous Ni-OH/P core contributed to high stability under harsh conditions. This work presents a facile and easy scale-up path to develop self-supported hybrid electrodes for efficient and stable energy conversion and storage.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000505550900023

The major challenge in using non-precious metals in place of these precious metal catalysts for OER is their low efficiency and poor stability, which urgently demand new concepts and strategies to tackle this issue. Herein, we report a universal strategy to directly synthesize single layer graphene encapsulating uniform earth-abundant 3d transition-metal nanoparticles such as Fe, Co, Ni and their alloys in a confined channel of mesoporous silica. The single atomic thickness of the graphene shell immensely promotes the electron transfer from the encapsulated metals to the graphene surface, which efficiently optimizes the electronic structure of the graphene surface and thereby triggers the OER activity of the inert graphene surface. We investigated a series of non-precious 3d metals encapsulated within single layer graphene, and found that the encapsulated FeNi alloy showed the best OER activity in alkaline solutions with only 280 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2), and also possessed a high durability after 10000 cycles. Both the activity and durability of the non-precious catalyst even exceed that of the commercial IrO2 catalyst, showing great potential to replace precious metal catalysts in the OER.									536	41	0	0	16	0	543			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000367622700013

Besides a dense structure without rapid penetration paths for oxidants and other corrosives, refractory components such as alumina oxide or oxide-containing compounds also help to repel oxygen through coatings, which can ensure a long service life of EBC when used to infiltrate and block pores. However, due to their melting temperature up to nearly 2000 degrees C, melting and infiltration will damage EBC and matrix. In this work, metallic aluminum first infiltrates into open pores and microcracks at a low temperature of 750 degrees C, forming a dense structure, and then reacts in situ to form the refractory phases during heat treatment at 1100 degrees C, which is far below the melting point of refractory components of nearly 2000 degrees C. The results demonstrate that the structure remained dense after heat treatment. An intermedia layer composed of alumina and ytterbium aluminum garnet was observed due to the diffusion and reaction of oxygen and aluminum. The dense and refractory diffusion-reaction layer prevents the rapid infiltration and diffusion of oxidants in the engine environment to coating and matrix.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000725038300003

In this study, an organic-inorganic S-scheme of a one-dimensional g-C3N4 nanotube (TCN)/Ag3PO4 photocatalytic system with high photocatalytic water oxidation activity was designed by coupling g-C3N4 nanotubes over Ag3PO4 particles through a chemical coprecipitation method. The TCN/Ag3PO4 heterojunction demonstrated excellent photocatalytic O-2 production with an O-2 evolution rate of up to 370.2 mu mol.L-1.h(-1). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed that electron migration between TCN and Ag3PO4 led to the formation of an internal electric field pointing from TCN to Ag3PO4, which drove the S-scheme charge transfer mode between TCN and Ag3PO4. Accordingly, the TCN/Ag3PO4 heterojunction possessed fast charge separation and high redox ability, leading to high photoactivity and photostability. This research provides a new strategy for fabricating highly efficient inorganic-organic S-scheme photocatalysts for O-2 production.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000724492300003

A porous carbon capacitor with sulfuric acid electrolyte is a typical system, and corresponding physical properties are used to illustrate the effects. Oxygen and hydrogen evolution are considered the dominant side reactions, and a Tafel form for the kinetic expressions is assumed. It is shown that keeping the cell potential within the thermodynamic stability window of the solvent does not guarantee negligible losses, even in the kinetics are not particularly facile. Losses are substantial at early cycles and decrease to a constant value at later cycles; this value can be significant. The dependences of coulombic an energy losses on the maximum cell potential, electrode thickness, and discharge rate are discussed. In a poorly designed cell, the energy lost to side reactions can be as large or larger than the ohmic loss; hence consideration of side reactions is essential for good design.									100	2	0	0	4	0	101			0013-4651			WOS:A1996UQ66200018

Ahmed								The influences of some additives on electrochemical behaviour of nickel electrodes								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				34	3			1548	1555		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.11.074				FEB 2009	2009	Nickel hydroxide is used as an active material in positive electrodes of rechargeable alkaline batteries. Since the nickel hydroxide electrode exhibits a poor performance which results not only from the competitive reactions of the oxidation of the active material but also from the evolution of oxygen. Its reduced charge acceptance is suspected to be related to a relatively long distance between nickel hydroxide particles and the nearest portion of the substrate. The practical capacity of the positive nickel electrode depends on the efficiency of the conductive network connecting the Ni(OH)(2) particle with the current collector.In this study, a pasted-type electrode is prepared using spherical nickel hydroxide powder as the main active material on a foamed nickel grid as a current collector. The effects of additives such as metallic cobalt powder, cobalt hydroxide, calcium carbonate and cobalt powder with calcium carbonate on the electrode performance are examined. The calcium carbonate addition increases the oxygen evolution potential while the metallic cobalt powder and its compounds enhance the conductivity of the active material. This combined effect in nickel hydroxide electrode in turn increases the capacity of the NiMH battery due to the augmentation in the utilization of the active material of the positive electrode.

Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of amorphous hollow M(OH)(x) (M = Fe, Co, Ni) nanocubes through a template-assisted route inspired by Pearson's hard and soft acid-base (HSAB) principle with Cu2O nanocubes with different sizes (50 nm, 500 nm) as the sacrificial templates. A comparative study of the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of the hollow M(OH)(x) nanocubes with a similar size indicates that Ni(OH)(2) has better OER catalytic activity. It has been revealed that the metal oxyhydroxides formed at the surface are actually the real active species for the OER electrocatalysis. In particular, Ni(OH)(2) nanocubes obtained by the Cu2O (50 nm) template provide the best OER activity, with a low overpotential of 349 mV vs. RHE to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 63 mV dec(-1). The hollow metal hydroxide nanostructures through the Pearson's principle-inspired strategy can be highly efficient electrocatalysts for OER applications.									20	0	0	0	4	0	20				2052-1537		WOS:000440019000014

The results were compared with those from a commercial Vulcan carbon XC-72 (254 m(2) g(-1)) support. ATO (85 m(2) g(-1)) and modified-ATO (216 m(2) g(-1)) were synthesized by the sol-gel method and were then characterized by XRD, BET and TEM. The modification of the ATO consisted of adding dodecylamine as a surfactant to generate a surface area similar to that of Vulcan carbon. The electrochemical characterization conditions were chosen to match the operating conditions of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and a solid polymer electrolyser (SPE), where the oxygen-evolution reaction takes place at a potential near 1.6 V with respect to normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). The results show good chemical stability when the ATO and the modified-ATO are subjected to these conditions, whereas Vulcan carbon corrodes easily. This indicates that Sb-doped SnO2 is a good candidate for electrocatalyst supports for energy-conversion systems such as electrolysers and unified regenerative fuel cells.

Here, the unique semi-enclosed sector structure of Salophen ligands with highly symmetric N, N, O, O mode was introduced to construct binuclear Co complex [Co-2(salophen)(Cl)(2)(C2H3N)] (compound 1), which provides preliminary theoretical basis for the efficient coreshell structure electrocatalysts obtained by pyrolysis regulation. Moreover, we adopted TG-MS to real-time track the pyrolysis process from precursors of binuclear Co complexes with Salophen ligand to efficient catalytic materials with core-shell nanostructures. As expected, the 1-600 sample achieves ultra-low overpotential of 256 mV at 10 mA center dot cm(-2) and high catalytic stability within 10 h in 1 mol/L KOH solution. This work highlights salophen-ligated complex as excellent precursor material system for the analysis of pyrolysis evolution process, and provides an opportunity for targeted preparation of efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) nanocatalysts.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			1001-604X	1614-7065		WOS:000677718100001

Multiple reactions with different kinetic controls are considered at both electrodes. The computational algorithm solving the model was implemented in OpenFOAM. It allows the calculations for a given local potential at the working electrode, potentiostatic control, or for a fixed cell potential difference and also for a current flowing through the cell, galvanostatic operation. The model was validated by using the reduction of ferricyanide and the oxidation of ferrocyanide from dilute solutions as main test reactions and hydrogen and oxygen evolution as secondary ones, in a modified hydrocyclone. A close agreement between experimental and predicted current distributions was obtained. The hydrocyclone presents a promising electrochemical performance being the mass-transfer conditions in its cylindrical part better than in the conical region. The computational tool developed in this paper can be employed to optimize both cells stack design and system operation conditions. Likewise, the algorithm can also be used to check, when limiting current studies are needed, whether the desired reaction is under mass-transfer or charge-transfer control for a given geometric configuration.

Transition metal phosphates have been reported as a potential candidate due to the unique coordination and corresponding electronic structure. Herein, we adopted a facile method for preparing NaCoPO4@PC derived from a metal organic framework (MOF) as a bifunctional electrode. ZIF-67 was synthesized before a refluxing process with Na2HPO4 to form a precursor, which is transformed into the final product via calcination in different atmospheres. Specifically, the resultant NaCoPO4@PC exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1178.7 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1) for a supercapacitor. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled with active carbon displays a high capacitance of 163.7 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1). In addition, as an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, the NaCoPO4@C electrode requires only 299 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) . These results suggest that the rational design of MOF-derived NaCoPO4@PC provides a variety of practical applications in electrochemical energy conversion and storage.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1793-2920	1793-7094		WOS:000505160900003

In the present work, we describe a simple approach for the fabrication of CoS2-TiO2 hybrid catalysts by the heat treatment of a cobalt thiourea complex in the presence of TiO2. We show the CoS2-TiO2 hybrid as a bi-functional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting in alkaline electrolyte membrane water electrolyzers. The optimal CoS2-TiO2 hybrid offered low overpotentials of 231 and 198 mV for the OER and HER, respectively. Fundamental studies pertaining to the role of TiO2 in enhancing the catalytic activity of the materials using optical and electrochemical band gap measurements of the CoS2-TiO2 hybrids were carried out. Additionally, the constructed MEA using the CoS2-TiO2 hybrid showed higher performance with an approximately 234 mA cm(-2) current density at a cell voltage of 1.9 V and exhibited extended durable operation over 200 h, as compared to the MEA constructed with state-of-the-art all-noble-metal electrodes.									28	0	0	0	4	0	28			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000422949700038

Cyclic voltammetry experiments indicated that the catalytic process proceed via "one-site catalysis with two-sites oxidation" mechanism in which both two metal sites store the required oxidation equivalents for water oxidation and O-O bond formation occurs by single-site water nucleophilic attack (WNA).

The synthesis of the electrode materials with high conductivity and promising cycling durability will be a critical aspect for Li-O-2 batteries. In this article, a hybrid composite of CoS2 nanocages derived from ZIF-67 and interconnected by carbon nanotubes (CoS2/CNTs) is prepared and used in the air electrode fabrication for Li-O-2 batteries. A reversible capacity of 2398.9 mAh g(-1) is obtained, equivalent to 90% of the discharge capacity. When restricting the cycling capacity to 500 mAh g(-1), the battery exhibits cycling stability for 52 cycles, with the cutoff potential keeping above 2.0 V. The key point of this material is the formation of porous CoS2 nanocages and insertion of the nanocages with CNTs, forming interconnected electrically conducting networks. The incorporation of CNTs serves as channels for fast electron transfer, which overcomes the poor conductivity of CoS2. Furthermore, the porous CoS2 nanocages could provide affluent active sites for an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which also facilitates the diffusion of O-2 and the infiltration of electrolytes. The combination of highly conductive CNTs and CoS2 with efficient catalytic activity renders improvement in the battery performance.									21	0	0	0	2	0	21			2168-0485			WOS:000537685200005

We presumed that the photochemistry of crystal-amorphous mixed semiconductor systems would be governed by the interface characteristics, and conducted a systematic study to understand the origins of the largely varying photochemical reaction of semiconductors having an amorphous phase. First-principles calculations on crystalline anatase and amorphous TiO2 showed that the coexistence of crystalline and amorphous TiO2 and the exposure of the phase boundary are advantageous due to the accelerated charge separation by interface dipole moment and the parallelizable oxygen evolution reaction at the boundary. Our computation-based strategies were demonstrated in our experiments: only the TiO2 nanoparticle and nanotube having partial amorphization on surfaces have highly enhanced photocatalytic water splitting performances (approximately 700%) compared to the pristine and completely amorphized TiO2 systems.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000700805000001

Here, a highly active and conductive shell-based cellular (Shellular) electrode is developed through a strategy of embedding nanocrystalline Ni3Nb intermetallics into an amorphous NiFe-OOH matrix. The tailor-made laser remelting process enables the dispersive precipitation of corrosion-resistant nanocrystalline Ni3Nb in large numbers. After in situ electrochemical activation in the self-developed growth-mode-control electrolyte, the amorphous NiFe-OOH nanosheets and nanocrystalline Ni3Nb are formed on the as-printed Inconel 718. The conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate that nanocrystalline Ni3Nb can simultaneously enhance the conductivity and activity of the catalyst film. Additionally, a Shellular structure inspired by nature is designed, interestingly, its specific surface area keeps constant with increases in porosity. This design can result in a large surface area and high porosity but with less material cost. Using this electrochemically activated Shellular electrode for OER, a high current density of 1500 mA cm(-2) is achieved at a record-low overpotential of 261 mV with good durability. This development may open the door for large-scale industrial water electrolysis.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000659247300001

Here, a synthetic strategy is developed toward the customizable combination of orthogonally reactive metal nanocrystals within interconnected carbon-cavities as a compartmentalized framework by employing aminated-silica-directed thermal solid-state nanoconfined synthesis of metal nanocrystals and endotemplating concomitant carbonization-mediated interlocking, as key processes. The main advantage of the strategy is the facility to choose any combination of metals, which can be further employed according to the desired application. The strategically synthesized compartmentalized multifunctional catalytic architectures of Pd-Pt@Com-CF regulate the O-2-mediated selective cascade oxidation reaction converting alcohol to acid with high yield and selectivity; and another Pt-Ir@Com-CF platform is demonstrated as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000474266900011	31074190

In this study, the effects of KOH/biomass ratios (1:8 to 1:1) and temperatures (400-800 ?C) on biomass pyrolysis were investigated. The KOH chemical activation mechanism was explored by revealing the evolution mechanisms of the gaseous product, bio-oil, biochar, and KOH, based on experiments and quantum calculations. Results showed that KOH can react with active O-containing species in biomass, which was the main reaction at lower ratios (1:8-1:2) or lower temperatures (400-600 degrees C). Here, KOH was completely transformed to K2CO3, leading to the formation of large amounts of gaseous products and phenols (reaching 75%). The reaction between KOH and more stable carbon fragments, however, was enhanced at higher ratios (>1:2) or higher temperatures (700-800 ?C), such that it became the main reaction. With a significant decrease in the phenols and O-species, the hydrocarbons became the dominant species (reaching a content of 57.43%). For biochar, the reactions among KOH, O-containing species, and carbon fragments generated an abundance of vacancies in the biochar. The OH- from KOH rapidly entered these vacancies, forming a large amount of new O-containing groups (i.e., C=O, -OH, C-O, O-C=O, and -COOH groups). This also caused an increase in oxygen content (reaching 23.68 wt%) in biochar. At higher temperatures, the reactions between KOH and biomass were significantly enhanced, along with a sharp increase in the specific surface area (reaching 1351.13 m(2)/g). O-containing groups further transformed to more stable -OH, C-O, and -COOH groups. Based on the evolution mechanism of pyrolytic products and KOH, the KOH chemical activation mechanism during biomass pyrolysis was revealed, allowing us, for the first time, to propose a possible chemical reaction pathway between KOH and O-containing groups.									67	4	0	0	14	0	70			0306-2619	1872-9118		WOS:000596119200003		
J	Gao, Yidan; Bai, Ling; Zhang, Xin; Yang, Fengchun								Non-Parallel Photo-Assisted Electrocatalysis Mechanism of SnS2/NiO Heterojunction for Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction								CHEMELECTROCHEM				8	11			2087	2093		10.1002/celc.202100464				JUN 1 2021	2021	Developing high activity electrocatalysts for OER with low cost materials has remained a great challenge in electrochemical water splitting. As a clean and renewable energy source, light energy is becoming increasingly important as a driving force to improve the performance of catalyst. Herein, we investigate the electrocatalytic activity of SnS2/NiO heterojunction under visible light irradiation. The p-n junction structure promotes the production of more high-valence Ni (Ni3+) on NiO after illumination as the active site of OER. SnS2/NiO shows superior electrocatalytic activity, small overpotential of 310 mV for OER to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a significant current density. Moreover, a photo-assisted non-parallel catalytic mechanism is proposed according to the mode of action of light. At low potentials, light is the dominant player to reduce the initial potential of the OER reaction, and at high potentials, the applied potential acts as the dominant player to further increase OER performance. This work provides an efficient strategy to manipulate the electronic environment, optical energy and energy band of semiconductors for improved electrocatalytic OER activity.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2196-0216			WOS:000664241000016

Hematite, all iron alpha-Fe2O3, would be an ideal OER catalyst in alkaline media due to its abundance and easy processing. Despite its promising theoretical potential, it has demonstrated very poor OER activity under multiple experimental conditions, significantly worse than that of Co or Ni-based oxides. In the search for improving hematite performance, we have analysed the effect of doping with redox vs. non-redox active species (Ni or Zn). Our results indicate that Zn doping clearly outperforms Ni, commonly accepted as a preferred dopant. Zn-doped hematite exhibits catalytic performances close to the state-of-the-art for alkaline water splitting: reaching 10 mA cm(-2) at just 350 mV overpotential (eta) at pH 13, thus twenty times that of hematite. Such a catalytic enhancement can be traced back to a dramatic change in the reaction pathway. Incorporation of Ni, as previously suggested, decreases the energetic barrier for the OER on the available centres. In contrast, Zn facilitates the appearance of a dominant and faster alternative via a two-site reaction, where the four electron oxidation reaction starts on Fe, but is completed on Zn after thermodynamically favoured proton coupled electron transfer between adjacent metal centres. This unique behaviour is prompted by the non-redox character of Zn centres, which maintain the same charge during OER. Our results open an alternative role for dopants on oxide surfaces and provide a powerful approach for catalytic optimisation of oxides, including but not limited to highly preferred all-iron oxides.									18	2	0	0	2	0	18			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000519240000017	34084411

SLG serves as a working electrode which separates the liquid electrochemical environment from the ambient to enable direct energy-level determination. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) thereby reveals the shifts in Fermi-level of suspended SLG under electrochemical reaction conditions in aqueous alkaline media. Polymer-free transfer to create suspended SLG minimizes contributions to doping related to any support or contaminants, such that changes in work function (WF) relate predominantly to the electrochemical system under study. These WF changes are rationalized in the context of a simple model of electrochemical gating, providing insight into the interplay between electronic and electrochemical doping (through redox of water) of suspended graphene. Further changes in WF are attributable to the reversible functionalization of graphene during the oxygen evolution reaction. Mechanical changes in the suspended graphene in the form of bulging also occur, which are attributed to electro-wetting of graphene induced by charge-carrier doping.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2196-7350			WOS:000691144800001

Herein, we report the electrocatalytic function of an iron-based Gibeon meteorite for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). After ageing under operational conditions in an alkaline electrolyte, an activity matching or possibly slightly superior to the best performing OER catalysts emerges, with stable overpotentials as low as 270 mV (for 10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slopes of 37 mV decade(-1). The Faradaic efficiency for the OER was unity and no deterioration in performance was detected during 1000 hours of OER operation at 500 mA cm(-2). Mechanistic studies suggest an operando surface modification involving the formation of a 3D oxy(hydroxide) layer with a metal atom composition of Co0.11Fe0.33Ni0.55, as indicated by Raman and XPS studies and trace Ir as indicated via elemental analysis. The growth of the catalyst layer was self-limiting to <200 nm after ca. 300 hours of operation as indicated through XPS depth profiling and cyclic voltammetry. The unique composition and structure of the Gibeon meteorite suggest that further investigation of Ir-Co-Ni-Fe systems or other alloys inspired by natural materials for water oxidation are of interest.									21	0	0	0	2	0	21			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000387862100013

Sulfur-incorporated nickel iron (oxy)hydroxide (S-NiFeOOH) nanosheets were directly grown on commercial nickel foam using a galvanic corrosion method and a hydrothermal method. The incorporation of sulfur into NiFeOOH enhanced the catalytic activity for the HER and OER in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The enhanced catalytic activity is attributed to the change in the local structure and chemical states due to the incorporation of sulfur. High performance for overall water splitting was achieved with an alkaline water electrolyzer. This was realized by employing S-NiFeOOH as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, thereby outperforming a water electrolyzer that requires the usage of precious metal electrocatalysts (i.e., Pt/C as the HER electrocatalyst and IrO2 as the OER electrocatalyst). Moreover, when driven by a commercial silicon solar cell, an alkaline water electrolyzer that uses S-NiFeOOH as a bifunctional electrocatalyst generated hydrogen under natural illumination. This study shows that S-NiFeOOH is a promising candidate for a large-scale industrial implementation of hydrogen production for overall water splitting because of its low cost, high activity, and durability. In addition, the solar-driven water electrolyzer using S-NiFeOOH as a bifunctional electrocatalyst affords the opportunity for developing effective and feasible solar power systems in the future.

Fe(III) was ineffective in the inhibition of DPC-DCIP reaction while Fe(II) decreased the rate of DCIP photoreduction supported by DPC in the same concentration range as Mn(II). The effectivity of the interaction of Fe(II) with the high affinity Mn-binding site depends on different anions in the same manner as for Mn(II) and coincides with hierarchy observed for the stimulation of O-2 evolution. The Fe(II) binding is accompanied by its oxidation. By using reductants it was shown that the high affinity site contains a redox-active component and the reduction of this component totally prevents the binding of Fe(II).									16	0	1	0	12	0	17			0014-5793			WOS:A1995TG00800013	7498504

Nevertheless, the efficiency of such a promising route is still unsatisfactory due to the low sunlight utilization, poor selectivity towards H(2)O(2)production, and the requirement of additional Fe-based co-catalysts in the Fenton reaction. Here we present a fascinating design to synthesize a metal-free photocatalyst for highly selective H(2)O(2)production and efficient water purificationviaa Fenton-like cascade reaction. A BP/OPCN heterojunction is constructed for the first time by assembling 2D oxygen-enriched porous g-C3N4(OPCN) with 2D black phosphorus (BP), which can effectively promote the visible light response and charge separation. Further investigation reveals that the surface oxygen groups and nanopores of the OPCN are critical both in increasing the active sites and in enhancing the selectivity of H(2)O(2)production. The highest H(2)O(2)production rate of BP/OPCN reaches a remarkable value of 3463 mu mol h(-1)g(-1), which is much higher than that of reported g-C3N4-related materials. The large amount of H(2)O(2)producedin situover BP/OPCN can subsequently undergo a Fenton-like cascade reaction to degrade organic pollutants in wastewater in only one step. This work demonstrates an efficient photocatalytic approach to produce H(2)O(2)and purify wastewater, while discovering the fundamental roles of the surface chemistry and physical structure of the photocatalyst.									33	0	0	0	4	0	33			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000573889000028

One of the biggest challenges and the bottleneck in developing high-performance rechargeable ZABs are the design of suitable bifunctional air electrodes, with controlled chemical compositions and well-designed architectures that can efficiently catalyze the key oxygen reactions. Air electrodes are the most significant and complicated part of the rechargeable ZABs that inevitably determine the electrochemical performance and cycling stability. This paper particularly reviews the most recent developments, in designing and fabricating air electrodes with oxygen electrocatalysts. It covers the discussion on the relationships between surface structure and reaction mechanism. It highlights the developments of air electrodes in three main categories: 1) conventional powdery catalysts physically deposited on gas diffusion layer (GDL), 2) catalysts in situ grown on substrates, and 3) freestanding catalyst films or wires. The latter two are also known as self-supported air electrodes with desired properties of advanced nanostructures and binder-free assembly. In this review, various advanced air electrodes composed of non-noble catalysts are presented and discussed. Further, a general perspective for designing and fabricating high-performance air-electrodes is proposed to prolong the lifespan of electrically rechargeable.									110	6	0	0	4	0	111			2405-8297			WOS:000484341600026

The utility and the effectiveness of these techniques to the investigation of in situ formed surface layers are clearly demonstrated by the dependence of the spectra on immersion time. The spectra of the emersed surfaces give evidence that OH- ions in solution adsorb at the electrode surface and donate their electrons to the surface cations. This is observed as a reduction of the tungsten valency to a W5d1 electron state located in the conduction band which is, for the first time, directly revealed by UPS. This surf ace cluster state catalyzes the reduction reaction of dissolved oxygen and is essential for the formation of adsorbed superoxide radicals. In a model based on combined electromotive force measurements we postulate that the activity of the OH ions in the solution determines the activity of adsorbed superoxide ions via donor-acceptor reactions whereby the surface tungsten cation functions as an electron transmitter from OH- to the adsorbing oxygen molecule. This coupling of the OH ion activity in the solution with the activity of adsorbed superoxide is proposed as the fundamental mechanism which explains the remarkable stability and reversibility of the open-circuit electrical potential observed on W18O49 and LaxWO3 oxygen electrodes.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0013-4651			WOS:A1992JX17200010

They can be considered as a potential electrolyte for fuel cells as SOFC. Substituted silicated rare earth oxyapatites with formula La9.33+z/3-xMex square(0.67-z/3)(SiO4)(6)O2+z/2-x/2 (z < x < z +4) have been prepared by solid-state reaction at high temperature. Two series have been synthesized: a first one is oxygen stoichiometric with formula La9.33-2x/3Mex square(0.67-x/3)(SiO4)(6)O-2, and a second one is anion deficient with formula La9.17-2x/3Mex square(0.83-x/3)(SiO4)(6)O-1.75 square(0.25). In both cases, cationic vacancies are similarly controlled and vary from 0.67 to 0 per unit cell: the aim is to study the influence of cationic vacancies on the ionic conductivity with two distinct oxygen stoichiometries. Cell parameters of the high-purity oxyapatites have been refined in order to check the strontium incorporation. Discontinuous evolution of the a parameter underlined the strong electrostatic interactions between the defects of the most highly substituted samples. Electrical properties of the samples have also been studied by the complex impedance method between 280 and 620 degrees C. The evolution of conductivity and activation energy with the cationic vacancies content gives information on the conductivity mechanism, highlighting the importance of the global stoichiometry of the material.

Rapid kinetics requires high-activity catalysts while good mass transport demands efficient transport domains. Recent fundamental studies in these areas focus more on the improvement in catalyst activity, whereas the importance of mass transport should not be underestimated, which is the focal point of this work. Hierarchical pores are generally considered to be conducive to enhancing reaction kinetics and mass transport, but the degree of order of pore structures has a significant influence over the fuel cell performance. Herein, we introduce the concept of 'longrange order, short-range disorder' to design transport domains and reaction interfaces: dispensing with conventional microfabrication techniques, well-ordered, one-dimensional channel arrays are constructed using vascular bundles of natural material, capable of decreasing tortuosity, increasing porosity, optimizing reactant distribution and thus minimizing concentration losses; further, intrinsic biominerals and tissues of organisms existing on the inner and outer walls of channel arrays are harnessed to form hierarchically porous domains, that is, raising the roughness of reaction interfaces by increasing the degree of short-range disorder. The combination of one-dimensional flow channels (long-range order) and hierarchically porous reaction interfaces (short-range disorder), analogous to blood vessels composed of arteries/veins and capillaries, ensures the optimization of mass transport and catalytic kinetics, leading to an electrocatalytic oxygen reduction performance enhancement over a wide array of biomass-derived carbonaceous materials. Accordingly, this work provides inspiration for finding the right balance between mass transport and reaction kinetics from an order perspective.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000663204700007

Over the years, numerous nanocatalytic materials have been explored in efforts to substantially boost the inherently sluggish catalytic processes. Despite achievements, the lack of fundamental insights into the design and identification of active sites and the structure-performance relationship has been one of the main obstacles to further improvement in catalytic performance. With the development of first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations and state-of-art spectroscopic techniques, the pace of research has started to move forward again. In this Account, we illustrate our recent representative attempts to gain fundamental insights into the rational development of efficient nanocatalytic materials and thus boost the typical electrochemical and mechanochemical conversions of energy-related small-molecules, including for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and ammonia synthesis. DFT calculations and advanced spectroscopic techniques, such as synchrotron radiation-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS, hard and soft Xray), were properly adopted for this purpose. Specifically, to achieve a fast-electrochemical hydrogen evolution process, Ir active sites with balanced hydrogen adsorption/ desorption behaviors were first computationally designed via orbital modulation and experimentally identified, and they showed significantly enhanced catalytic activity toward HER in acidic media. For the electrochemical reduction of oxygen, well-designed Zn-N2 active sites and quinone functional groups were introduced into the different carbon matrixes and structurally identified by the XAS technique, utilizing hard and soft X-rays, respectively. Both experimental and DFT studies revealed that Zn-N2 active sites with their unique structure can greatly activate the adsorbed oxygen species, leading to a highly efficient and selective four-electron oxygen reduction pathway, while the quinone functional groups are able to modify the activation mode and alter it into a selective two-electron oxygen reduction pathway for H2O2 production. In another study, inspired by the dissociation of stable nitrogen molecules on the surface of Fe, dynamic strained Fe active sites were designed for mechanochemical ammonia synthesis. Combined XAS and Mo''ssbauer spectroscopy revealed the formation of a shortrange Fe4N structure by the Fe active sites and dissociated nitrogen during the ball milling process, facilitating robust hydrogenation Thanks to the theoretical methods and advanced spectroscopic techniques, fundamental insights into the design and identification of active sites and understanding of the structure-performance relationship can be easily obtained using such tools, which will guide the development of nanocatalytic materials and boost the conversions of energy-related small-molecules for various applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000736855700001	34937339

With this method, transition metal phosphide/graphene composites with adjustable heterostructures including transition metal phosphide/P-doped graphene and core@shell transition metal phosphide@graphitized carbon/P-doped graphene could be obtained by using metal organic framework (MOF)/graphene as a precursor within 20 s. In contrast, traditional programmed heat treatment only results in transition metal phosphide/non-doped graphene. We reveal for the first time that transition metal phosphides and their derived oxy/hydroxides, rather than the long thought graphitized carbon covering the surface of transition metal phosphides, are the most active sites for the HER and OER, respectively. Meanwhile, P-doping in graphene could highly improve its electrocatalytic performance while graphitized carbon encapsulation might impair its performance by separating it from the electrolyte. Therefore, bimetal phosphide (FeNiP)/P-doped graphene was determined as the most active metal phosphide/graphene heterostructure and it could deliver a very low overpotential of about 229 and 173 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media for the OER and HER, respectively. Furthermore, a high-performance overall water splitting cell that could achieve a current density of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2) at 1.58 and 1.74 V, respectively, was successfully constructed by using FeNiP/P-doped graphene as both cathode and anode.									54	3	0	0	5	0	54			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000474712700054

Here we realize a deep structure self-reconstruction of natural chalcopyrite to unlock its OER performance via mechanochemical activation. Compared with the manually milled counterpart (CuFeS2-HM), the mechanically milled catalyst (CuFeS2-BM) with a reduced crystallinity exhibits a 7.11 times higher OER activity at 1.53 V vs. RHE. In addition, the CuFeS2-BM requires a low overpotential of 243 mV for generating 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits good stability over 24 h. Further investigations suggest that the excellent OER performance of CuFeS2-BM mainly originates from the decreased crystallinity induced the in situ deep structure self-reconstruction of the originally sulfides into the electroactive and stable metal (oxy)hydroxide phase (e.g., alpha-FeOOH) via S etching under OER conditions. This study demonstrates that regulating the crystallinity of catalysts is a promising design strategy for developing highly efficient OER catalysts via managing the structure self-reconstruction process, which can be further extended to the design of efficient catalysts for other advanced energy conversion devices. In addition, this study unveils the great potentials of engineering abundant natural minerals as cost-effective catalysts for diverse applications (C) 2021 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences Published by Elsevier B.V.

The reaction initially takes place slowly on Ag(110) ( 5 x 1) O at the end of the AgO chain, whereas the reaction accelerates explosively upon the appearance of a reaction front that propagates along the direction perpendicular to the chain. The surface morphology of the region swept over by the reaction front completely changes from a (5 x 1)-O to a (2 x 3) structure with many rectangular islands possibly due to the formation of H2O(OH)(2). The induction time and explosive acceleration with the propagating reaction front imply that the reaction proceeds autocatalytically. The water clusters hydrating OH adsorbates play likely a central role in accelerating the reaction by supplying H2O to the O adatoms in the AgO chains at the reaction front.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1463-9076			WOS:000249740000020	19459291

Electrode materials with a wide energy storage potential window are urgently needed to assemble high-performance symmetric supercapacitors, which are more reliable than asymmetric supercapacitors, as the uncertainty of real working potential ranges of the cathode and anode in the operated symmetric supercapacitor can be reduced. In this work, a multicomponent electrode of Na0.2MnO2/Fe-FeOOH/MnO2/REG was fabricated which showed an extended potential window of -1.1 V to 1.25 V for charge storage. Oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions were restrained by the manganese oxides and iron materials, respectively. The electrode displayed high specific capacitance of 1528 mF cm(-2) (611.2 F g(-1)) at a current density of 1 mA cm(-2), with excellent rate capability (87.3% and 66.7% capacitance retention upon 20-fold and 100-fold increased current).

The successful deployment of MOE hinges upon the existence of an inert anode capable of sustained oxygen evolution. Herein we report the results of a program of materials design, selection, and testing of candidate anode materials and demonstrate the utility of iridium in this application. An electrolysis cell fitted with an iridium anode operating at 0.55 A cm(-2) produced liquid metal and oxygen gas by the decomposition of iron oxide dissolved in a solvent electrolyte of molten MgO-CaO-SiO2-Al2O3. The erosion rate of iridium was measured to be less than 8 mm y(-1). The stability of iridium is attributed to a mix of mechanisms including the electrochemical formation and simultaneous thermal decomposition of a surface film of iridium oxide.

This photochemical reaction shows great enhancement compared to the same protocol performed in the absence of light. Except for a few cases, the room temperature coupling in the dark (thermal process) generally does not work. When it does, it is likely to also involve free carbenes as key intermediates. Alternatively, photochemical reactions show a broad scope, can be performed under air and tolerate a wide variety of functional groups. Reaction-evolution monitoring, DFT calculations and control experiments have been used to evaluate the main aspects of this intricate mechanistic scenario. Biologically active molecules Adiphenine, Benactyzine and Aprophen have been prepared as examples of synthetic applications.									20	2	0	0	6	0	20			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000521440000001	31999021

In this work, multiwall carbon nanotubes supported carbon film encapsulated Pt NPs (Pt@C-MWCNTs) was synthesized and used in the selective oxidation of ethanol and glycerol in acidic aqueous solution. It was found that Pt@C-MWCNTs exhibited both higher activity and stability than bare Pt NPs. Characterization indicated that carbon film encapsulation can overcome the sintering, leaching and over-oxidation of Pt NPs during the reaction. Moreover, carbon film may also prevent the strong adsorption of organic carboxylic acid on Pt. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The synthetic method concerns light-induced deposition of Pt nanoparticles into the mesopores of the present TiO2 with average crystalline diameter of 3.3 nm. The as-prepared Pt/TiO2 NCs with a distinguished hollow inner structure resulted in a high catalytic surface area. The mesoporous structure of TiO2 NCs played an important role in avoiding Pt aggregation, which ensured high catalytic activity and stability. Furthermore, the TiO2 NCs have photosensitivity, which enhances catalysis of oxygen reduction reaction (the half-wave potential is 0.76 V (vs. RHE) and the value of kinetic density at UV irradiation is 4.65 mA cm(-2) (at 0.7 V) under UV irradiation, which is more positive than dark condition (0.714 V; 3.34 mA cm(-2))) and hydrogen evolution reaction (Corresponding Tafel slopes are 32 mV dec(-1) and 39 mV dec(-1) under UV irradiation and dark condition, respectively) on the surface of Pt/TiO2 NCs under UV irradiation.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000624503000007

Herein, we report surprising findings of Au diffusion and dissolution in a Ni2P matrix, forming single Au atoms and tiny clusters. The dynamic atomic diffusion process was directly probed by in situ heating scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The Au yolks can diffuse and dissolve completely into the Ni2P shell at temperatures of 350 degrees C or higher, resulting in an inward volume expansion of the Ni2P shell and formation of single Au atoms and tiny Au clusters in Ni2P. The resulting structure exhibited outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) efficiency that is 16-fold that of commercial IrO2. The in situ STEM finding explains its drastically improved catalytic performance after annealing, confirming Au single atoms and clusters on a Ni2P surface as active OER sites. Our finding emphasizes the role of dynamic structural changes during simple heat treatment to enhance catalysis efficiency.									51	5	0	0	2	0	52			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000484077800036	31343864

Although the diffusion kinetics of point defects in UO2 is well explored both experimentally and theoretically, the kinetics of defect clusters is not well understood. In this work the migration mechanisms of oxygen interstitial clusters of size one to five atoms. (1O(i)-5O(i)) in UO2 are investigated by temperature-accelerated dynamics simulations without any a priori assumptions of migration mechanisms. It is found that the migration paths of oxygen interstitial clusters are complex and non-intuitive, and that multiple migration paths and barriers exist for some clusters. It is also found that the cluster migration barrier does not increase with increasing cluster size and its magnitude has the following order: 2O(i) < 3O(i) < 1O(i) < 5O(i) < 4O(i). Possible finite-size effects are checked with three systems which are of different sizes. The results show good agreement with other available experimental and theoretical data. The cluster migration sequence might explain the interesting relationship measured experimentally between the oxygen diffusivity and stoichiometry in UO2+x.									19	1	0	0	1	0	20			0953-8984	1361-648X		WOS:000312105900020	23178635

Polyelemental catalysts consisting of two or more kinds of hybridized catalysts are particularly interesting because the combination of the electrochemical properties of each catalyst component can significantly facilitate oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions. Despite the recent advances that have been made in this field, the number of elements in the catalysts has been largely limited to two metals. In this study, we demonstrate the electrochemical behavior of Li-O-2 batteries containing a wide range of catalytic element combinations. Fourteen different combinations with single, binary, ternary, and quaternary combinations of Pt, Pd, Au, and Ru were prepared on carbon nanofibers (CNFs) via a joule heating route. Importantly, the Li-O-2 battery performance could be significantly improved when using a polyelemental catalyst with four elements. The cathode containing quaternary nanoparticles (Pt-Pd-Au-Ru) exhibited a reduced overpotential (0.45 V) and a high discharge capacity based on total cathode weight at 9130 mAh g(-1), which was similar to 3 times higher than that of the pristine CNF electrode. This superior electrochemical performance is be attributed to an increased catalytic activity associated with an enhanced O-2 adsorbability by the quaternary nanoparticles.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000634569100044	33691412

Ni(OH)(2) hollow nanorod arrays were obtained on Ni foam by simple alkali etching, and FeOOH was electrodeposited on the walls of hollow nanorods to construct FeOOH@Ni(OH)(2) sandwich hollow nanorod arrays, which help overcome the drawbacks of the poor conductivity and poor stability of FeOOH and boost the catalytic performance of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in comparison with the individual components. A fully contacted three-dimensional nanorod array structure provides many exposed catalytically active sites and promotes charge transfer during the electrochemical OER process. The presence of FeOOH can promote the formation of a more conductive catalytically active component, NiOOH, which improves the catalytic performance of Ni(OH)(2). The electronic interaction and synergistic catalysis between nickel and iron enhances the electrochemical performance of the catalyst significantly. The optimized FeOOH@Ni(OH)(2) sandwich hollow nanorod arrays show an outstanding OER activity with a small overpotential of 245 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 45 mV dec(-1). The catalyst can maintain a substantially constant voltage over 40 h in 1.0 M KOH solution.

Energy storage/conversion devices with improved performance have been achieved by utilization of metal-organic-framework (MOF)-derived carbon structures as active materials in recent years. However, the effects of MOF precursors on the performance of derived carbon materials are rarely investigated. Here, we report that the incorporation of small amount of Fe or Ni in Co-based MOFs leads to a significant enhancement for the derived carbon nanotube-based frameworks (CNTFs) in Na+/Cl- ion electrosorption. Further investigation revealed the enhanced performance can be attributed to the improved specific surface area, electrical conductivity, and electrochemical activity. Notably, the CoFe-CNTF derived from bimetallic CoFe-MOFs achieves a high ion adsorption capacity of 37.0 mg g(-1), superior to most of recently reported carbon-based materials. Furthermore, the CoFe-CNTF also demonstrates high catalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a Tafel slope of 87.7 mV dec(-1). After combination with three-dimensional graphene foam (3DG), the resultant CoFe-CNTF-coated 3DG is used as air-cathode to fabricate a flexible all-solid-state Zn-air battery, which exhibits a high open circuit potential of 1.455 V. Importantly, the fabricated flexible battery can light a light-emitting diode (LED) even when it is bent. This work provides new insights into designs of high-performance and flexible electrode based on MOF-derived materials.									20	2	0	0	2	0	20			2296-2646			WOS:000472165100001	31275928

The crystalline structure and microstructure of the porous BaTiO3-based ceramics were studied. All the sintered bodies showed a tetragonal perovskite structure. The porosity increased with increasing graphite contents. This is mainly due to an enhanced evolution of CO and CO2 gases resulting from the exothermic reactions of graphite and oxygen during the sintering. It was found that the discrepancy in the resistivities measured in air and CO atmospheres at high temperatures(〉～200℃) became remarkable with increasing temperature. The sensitivity of CO gas increased with porosity, since the reactions between CO gas and O2- and between CO gas and O- are active due to the formation of many reaction sites. The porous BaTiO3-based ceramics could be promising as a sensing material for CO gas sensors.				BaTiO3 분말에 흑연 분말을 첨가하여 BaTiO3계 가스센서용 다공성 감지물을 제조하였으며, 이 감지물의 결정구조와 미세구조를 연구하였다. 이 감지물 소성체는 정방정 perovskite 결정구조를 가지고 있었다. 흑연 분말의 첨가량이 증가함에 따라 소성체의 기공도가 증가하였다. 이것은 소성 시 흑연 분말과 산소가 발열반응하여 CO 및 CO2 가스를 생성하고, 이 가스가 휘발하였기 때문이라고 생각된다. 제조한 BaTiO3계 소성체는 대기에서 측정한 저항과 CO 가스에서 측정한 저항이 고온( 〉～200℃)에서 큰 차이를 나타내고 있으며, 온도가 증가함에 따라 차이가 커짐을 관찰하였다. 소성체 기공도의 증가에 따른 반응 site의 증가로 인하여 소성체의 표면흡착기인 O2-와 CO 가스의 반응과, 소성체에 있는 O-와 CO 가스의 반응이 활발하기 때문에 CO 가스의 민감도가 크게 증가하였다. 본 연구에서 제조된 다공성 BaTiO3계 세라믹스는 CO 가스센서의 감지물 재료로써 유망하다고 생각된다.					0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1225-9381			KJD:ART001009694

The results show that Ga readily intermixes with Cu upon deposition in vacuum. However, even traces of oxygen in the gas ambient cause Ga oxidation and the formation of two-dimensional ("monolayer") Ga oxide islands uniformly covering the Cu surface. The surface morphology and the oxidized state of Ga remain in H-2 as well as in a CO2 + H-2 reaction mixture at elevated pressures and temperatures (0.2 mbar, 700 K). The results indicate that the Ga-doped Cu surface under reaction conditions exposes a variety of structures including GaOx/Cu interfacial sites, which must be taken into account for elucidating the reaction mechanism.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000613198200020	33510828

Here, we show that an enzyme of unknown activity, RhCC from Rhodococcus jostii RHA1, functions as an oxygenase, using 4-hydroxyphenylenolpyruvate as a substrate. This unique and complex reaction yields 3-hydroxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-pyruvate, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, and oxalic acid as major products. Incubations with (H2O)-O-18, O-18(2), and a substrate analogue suggest that this enzymatic oxygenation reaction likely involves a peroxide anion intermediate. Analysis of sequence similarity and the crystal structure of RhCC (solved at 1.78 angstrom resolution) reveal that this enzyme belongs to the tautomerase superfamily. Members of this superfamily typically catalyze tautomerization, dehalogenation, or decarboxylation reactions rather than oxygenation reactions. The structure shows the absence of cofactors, establishing RhCC as a rare example of a redox-metal- and coenzyme-free oxygenase. This sets the stage to study the mechanistic details of cofactor-independent oxygen activation in the unusual context of the tautomerase superfamily.									9	1	0	0	6	0	10			0006-2960			WOS:000349574900009	25565350	
J	Xiao, Hanshuang; Lv, Baoying; Zhao, Guohua; Wang, Yujing; Li, Mingfang; Li, Dongming								Hydrothermally Enhanced Electrochemical Oxidation of High Concentration Refractory Perfluorooctanoic Acid								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A				115	47			13836	13841		10.1021/jp207519j				DEC 1 2011	2011	A green hydrothermally enhanced electrochemical oxidation (HTEO) technique is developed to treat the high concentration refractory perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) wastewater on boron-doped diamond (BDD) film electrode. Results show that HTEO can demonstrate higher degradation efficiency for PFOA than the normal electrochemical oxidation (EO) process, with the removal of PFOA, total organic carbon (TOC), and organic fluorine in the HTEO process increasing by 1.1, 1.8, and 2.1 times, respectively. The kinetics study indicates that the degradation of PFOA follows a first-order reaction in the HTEO process with the apparent reaction rate constant 3.1 times higher than that in the EO process. The higher degradation efficiency of PFOA is due to the hydrothermal enhancement in electrochemical properties of the electrode and solution. Compared with EO, during the HTEO process, the conductivity and ionic migration rate of the solution is improved by 540% and 60%, respectively. In addition, the Tafel slope is increased to 343 from 279 mV dec(-1), indicating an inhibition effect of oxygen evolution reaction and a more effective oxidation of PFOA. In particular, the hydrothermal condition promotes a high formation rate of hydroxyl radical with the concentration almost 2 times of that in EO, which is considered the inner factor leading to the higher degradation efficiency. The density functional theory simulations demonstrate that the nonterminal C-C bonds in the main carbon chain can be easily destructed in the hydrothermal condition, as confirmed by the experimental detection of intermediates of C5F11COOH, C4F9COOH, C3F7COOH, C2F5COOH, CF3COOH, and some dicarboxylic acids. As a result, a reaction pathway is tentatively proposed.									42	6	0	0	28	0	46			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000297195300013	22013988

Here, we introduce the in situ Sn doping into the nanoworm-like alpha-Fe2O3 film with ultrasonic spray pyrolysis method. We show that the current density at 1.23 V vs. RHE (J(ph@1.23V)) under one-sun illumination can be improved from 10 to 130 mu A/cm(2) after optimizing the Sn dopant density. Moreover, J(ph@1.23V) can be further enhanced 25-folds compared to the untreated counterpart via the post-rapid thermal process (RTP), which is used to introduce the defect doping of oxygen vacancy. Photoelectrochemical impedance spectrum and Mott-Schottky analysis indicate that the performance improvement can be ascribed to the increased carrier density and the decreased resistances for the charge trapping on the surface states and the surface charge transferring into the electrolyte. X-ray photoelectron spectrum and X-ray diffraction confirm the existence of Sn and oxygen vacancy, and the potential influences of varying levels of Sn doping and oxygen vacancy are discussed. Our work points out one universal approach to efficiently improve the photoelectrochemical performances of the metal oxide semiconductors.									10	1	0	0	1	0	10			1931-7573	1556-276X		WOS:000520488300001	32130553

In this study, we develop a nickel and iron (di)sulfide (Ni-Fe-S) composite catalyst that is in situ synthesized and fixed within the intergranular nanopores inside high pure polycrystalline graphite. Two precursor solutions (reactants) may permeate the graphite intergranular pores to a depth of more than 3.5 mm. The nanoscale pores serve as an array of nanoreactors for the synthesis of the Ni-Fe-S nanoparticles under conditions much milder than usual. The prepared catalyst efficiently catalyzes both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) in 1.0 M KOH. It delivers a current density of 400 mA cm(-2) at a full cell voltage of around 2.3 V without considerable activity decay over 24 h electrolysis. The active species of the catalyst are different for the HER and OER and discussed accordingly. The synthesis strategy based on the nanopores in a monolithic conductive substrate proves to be a simple, efficient, and promising way to prepare electrocatalysts that are cheap, abundant, and industrially attractive.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000665843800001	34076965

The maximum cell voltage of Br EREC increased up to about 1.5 V without oxygen evolution. The energy density of EREC was greatly improved by using the redox reaction of bromide ions instead of iodide ions used in a previous work. It was found by monitoring the capacitance retention that SWCNT electrode can firmly hold the inserted Br molecules. We also investigated the structure and insertion site of the Br molecules inserted in SWCNTs by Raman and XRD measurements. Raman measurements revealed the existence of (Br-2)(n )chain-like molecules and Br-3(-) ions. Br molecules are likely to occupy the triangular lattice space of SWCNT bundles, because the diffraction lines of SWCNT bundle structure disappeared after Br insertion.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2158-5849	2158-5857		WOS:000451379900009

The investigation of its oxygenation is of great significance in revealing the reversible oxygenation mechanism of oxygen carriers. In this paper, a new method was proposed to directly investigate the oxygenation of histidine-cobalt complex by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The fragment ions of the oxygenated complexes were found from both aqueous samples of histidine-cobalt complex separately adsorbing oxygen at early time and continuously adsorbing oxygen for 24 h. The fragment ions of the oxygenated complexes were confirmed by its sub-fragment ion which just lost a neutral fragment of dioxygen by further fragmentation. Based on these results, the structure, mechanism and the species of dioxygen existed in the complex were deduced. The results show that the absorption process is a, dynamic process, and the structure of the oxygenated complex changes from dinuclear superoxo-bridged complex to dinuclear superoxo-hydroxo dibridge complex according to the evolution of oxygenation.. EST-MS may be an effective technique to research the oxygenation and characterize oxygenated complexes.									7	6	0	0	0	0	8			0251-0790			WOS:000293303800008

They have been found very effective in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis exploring heterogeneous catalysis for the production of chemicals such as liquid fuel and they have also been employed as successful promoters for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, so far there have been only a few reports on the application of iron carbide nanoparticles in the field of electrochemical sensing. Here, we present a stable form of Hagg carbide nanoparticles synthesized from a rare form of iron(III) oxide (beta-Fe2O3). The as-prepared nanomaterial was characterized employing X-ray powder diffraction and Mossbauer spectroscopy to prove its composition as well as an extraordinary high purity level. It turned out that Hagg carbide nanoparticles prepared by thermally treated beta-Fe2O3 exhibited excellent electrochemical properties including low charge transfer resistivity (Rct) compared to the other tested materials. Moreover, the Hagg carbide nanoparticles were tested as a promising electrocatalyst for voltammetric detection of the antibiotic metronidazole proving its practical applicability.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000406374000034	28702640

However, current synthetic methods generally deploy environmentally harmful chemicals and energy-consuming reaction conditions, despite the primary intent to attain renewable energy production. Here, the desirable properties of tungsten sulfide and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have been combined and hybrid materials have been fabricated through simultaneous electrochemical reduction and synthesis, as a versatile and environmentally benign alternative to conventional fabrication techniques. Through concurrent studies of three rGO materials, the precursor of which was graphene oxide (GO), produced by Hummers, Staudenmaier, or Hofmann oxidation methods, the importance of the choice of oxidation method employed prior to the fabrication of the hybrid was shown. In this cardinal study, a mixed WS2/WS3 film-like material (WS3-x) was synthesized directly onto GO-modified glassy carbon electrodes by cyclic voltammetry and the resultant hybrid materials (WS3-x/rGO) were thoroughly characterized by SEM, energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performances of WS3-x/rGO towards both HER and oxygen reduction reaction stemmed from the coupled impacts of amplified electrical conductivity and surface area of rGO; the presence of metallic species within rGO, resulting from the oxidation process; and the amount of WS3-x successfully electrodeposited in the hybrid. The efficacious fabrication of the WS3-x/rGO composite through electrosynthesis reveals an innovative and eco-friendly methodology for the development of cost-effective and highly active bifunctional electrocatalysts for renewable energy generation.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000404009500027	28449325

Understanding the mechanism of thermal stability and the reactions of layered molecular structure explosives can provide new ideas for the design of thermally stable explosives. In a molecular dynamics simulation of thermal decomposition of the layered molecular structure explosive 2,4,6-triamino-5-nitropyrimidine-1,3-dioxide, we find that the layered molecular structure provides free space for chemical bond deflection and expansion so that the external energy absorbed by chemical bonds on nonbenzene rings can be converted into angle bending energy and bond-stretching energy, which makes chemical bonds difficult to break and increases the thermal stability of the explosives. In the layered molecular structure explosive reactions, hydrogen-oxygen-bonded interlayer dimerizations and hydrogen interlayer transfer reactions are dominant.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000543038500037	32500901

However, in this study this kind of anode participated in a very effective EO process via a specific modular anode architecture. Traces of magnetic Fe3O4/Sb-SnO2 particles as auxiliary electrodes (AEs) were attracted on the surface of the two-dimensional (2D) Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5 by a NdFeB magnet, and thereby constituted a new magnetically assembled electrode (MAE). MAE could be renewed by recycling its AEs. The electrochemical properties as well as the EO performances of the MAE could be regulated by adjusting the loading amount of AEs. Results showed that even a small amount of AEs could increase surface roughness and offer massive effective active sites. When removing color of azo dye Acid Red G, the optimal MAE exhibited similar to 1100 % and similar to 500 % higher efficiencies than 2D Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5 and 2D Ti/Sb-SnO2, respectively. The superiority of the MAE was also applicable in degrading phenol. The synergy between Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5 and magnetic Sb-SnO2 particles was therefore discussed.									17	2	0	0	6	0	18			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000524482400055	31999960

Herein, we proposed a simple strategy to anchor MoS(2)quantum dots (QDs) on the Mo facet in Mo2C@foam nickel to craft an atomic-level heterostructure (MoS(2)QDs@Mo2C@NF). The MoS(2)QDs confined in Mo2C established a significant link between the electronic manipulation and activities of Mo2C by combining experiments and first-principles calculations. The Mo facet in Mo2C acting as an electron catcher could accelerate the vertical transmission of electrons from MoS(2)QDs to Mo2C and enrich electrons onto the Mo facet. Meanwhile, electrons on Mo2C by electro-excitation could quickly migrate to MoS(2)QDs through the intimate Mo (Mo2C)-S bond interfaces, resulting in a highly effective interface with low edge contact resistance. The as-synthesized MoS(2)QDs@Mo2C@NF exhibited considerable catalytic activity for the OER in 1 M KOH solution with an overpotential of 1.34 V at 10 mA cm(-2)and Tafel slope of 57 mV dec(-1)in comparison to RuO2@NF (1.35 V and 41 mV dec(-1)) owing to optimal adsorption energies of the OER intermediates on the MoS(2)QDs@Mo2C@NF, which originated from a strong electronic coupling effect at the heterointerfaces. These results herald the interface modulation of the electrocatalysts in the presence of a support carrier providing a promising strategy for designing advanced electrocatalysts.									18	1	0	0	3	0	18			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000555361700019

J	Fu, Dongju; Zhu, ZiYue; Chen, Jianjun; Ye, Liqiang; Song, XinRui; Zeng, XieRong								N-doped hollow carbon tubes derived N-HCTs@NiCo2O4 as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for rechargeable Zinc-air batteries								JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				902						115804	10.1016/j.jelechem.2021.115804		OCT 2021		DEC 1 2021	2021	It is paramount important to design and explore excellent bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts to conquer or weaken the shortcomings encountered by Zinc-air batteries at present. Herein, a novel N-doped hollow carbon tubes modified by uniform NiCo2O4 nanocrystals (N-HCTs@NiCo2O4), has been developed as an extremely efficient bifunctional catalyst. The hollow structure of N-HCTs possesses a large specific surface area of 610.60 cm g(-1) which provides abundant active N-dopant sites for the oxygen reduction reaction, whereas the NiCo2O4 nanocrystals serve as the positive phase for the oxygen evolution reaction. It is found that the efficient bifunctional activity is obtained by establishing a coupling interface between N-HCTs and NiCo2O4. The N-HCTs@NiCo2O4 composite has a half-wave potential of 0.81 V toward ORR and the overpotential of 330 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) toward OER as compared with noble metal catalysts. The N- HCTs@NiCo2O4 as the cathode catalyst for Zinc-air batteries exhibits superior peak power density (150 mW cm(-2)), specific capacity up to 779 mAh g(-1), and good stability even after 100 h of cyclic charge/discharge cycles N-HCTs@NiCo2O4 has good prospects for practical applications of non-precious metal catalysts in the cathode of Zinc-air batteries.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000718944400015		
J	Meng, Jia; Lei, Haitao; Li, Xialiang; Qi, Jing; Zhang, Wei; Cao, Rui								Attaching Cobalt Corroles onto Carbon Nanotubes: Verification of Four-Electron Oxygen Reduction by Mononuclear Cobalt Complexes with Significantly Improved Efficiency								ACS CATALYSIS				9	5			4551	4560		10.1021/acscatal.9b00213				MAY 2019	2019	Cobalt complexes have been extensively explored in catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is the cathode reaction in fuel cells. Although they show high activities, mononuclear Co complexes typically mediate the 2e reduction of O-2 to H2O2, and two Co sites are generally required to catalyze the 4e reduction of O-2 to H2O. Herein we report the significantly improved efficiency of covalently grafted Co corroles on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for the 4e ORR Azide-containing Co corroles can be attached to alkyne-modified CNTs via azide-alkyne cycloaddition. This attachment can avoid the formation of dimeric face-to-face Co corroles. The resulted hybrid catalyzes the 4e ORR in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solutions with a half-wave potential at 0.78 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). This performance makes this hybrid one of the most efficient Co-based molecular ORR electrocatalysts. Control studies using Co corrole analogues loaded on CNTs via noncovalent interactions give ORR. half-wave potentials at 0.68-0.61 V versus RHE. This work is significant in demonstrating that with proper covalent bond interactions to CNTs mononuclear Co corroles can become intrinsically active for the 4e ORR with significantly improved efficiency.									71	4	0	0	3	0	71			2155-5435			WOS:000467335600079

The amino compounds studied here include two amines (ethylamine and propylamine), five amino acids (beta-alanine, alanine, lysine, glycine, serine, and arginine), and one dipeptide (glycylglycine). Potential-dependent, time- and space-resolved in situ Raman spectra, together with electrochemical measurements, have been employed to reveal the electrocatalytic processes at the molecular level for the first time. Experimental results show that (i) the NHNFs act as an effective electron mediator with high electrocatalytic activity toward these amino compounds; (ii) the amino group is converted into a nitrile group, and decarboxylation occurs simultaneously for the alpha-amino acids; and (iii) the electrooxidation reaction rate of amino compounds is diffusion-controlled. Moreover, oscillations in both potential and current were observed for the first time during the electrocatalytic oxidation of these amino compounds on the film electrode of NHNFs. Periodic oxygen evolution plays a key role in the oscillations. It is initiated and terminated, respectively, when the surface concentration of amino compounds decreases to zero by diffusion-limited oxidation and is replenished by convection-enhanced flow from the gas release.									29	1	0	0	4	0	29			1932-7447			WOS:000250836100030

Herein, a novel carbon-doped Co nanoparticle coated with a carbon layer supported on the ordered macroporous titanium oxide (C-doped Co@C@TiO2) is designed as the highly efficient and stable ORR catalysts. The C-doped Co@C@TiO2 achieves the superior catalytic activity with an onset potential of 0.867 V and a limiting current density of-6.59 mA cm(-2), which is much lower than the commercial Pt/C (-5.93 mA cm(-2)). The turnover frequency (TOF) of the C-doped Co@C@TiO2 at the potential of 0.3 V (0.091 s(-1)) is nearly four times than the commercial Pt/C (0.025 s(-1)). This outstanding catalytical performance is attributed to the unique C-doped Co layer in Co nanoparticles, which can stable the OOH* and promote the desorption of OH*, and accelerate the catalyst surface regeneration in ORR. Meanwhile, the outer C layer with mesoporous channels can improve the stability and poisoning resistant of the C-doped Co nanoparticles, and the C-doped Co@C@TiO2 still retains 98% of the current density after the reaction for 60 h. It is worth noting that the assembled zinc-air battery with C-doped Co@C@TiO2 as the air cathode exhibits an ultra-high open circuit voltage of 1.51 V and an excellent durability of more than 41.6 days. This work provides one of the most promising non-noble metal-based catalysts for efficient and stable oxygen reduction reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0008-6223	1873-3891		WOS:000805837400004

Herein, we present the design and synthesis of a novel three-dimensional(3D)-networked heterogeneous nickel phosphide/sulfide electrocatalyst consisting of Ni2P strongly coupled with Ni3S2 in situ grown on Ni foam. Benefiting from the strong interfacial coupling effects between Ni2P and Ni3S2, large surface area, highly conductive Ni foam support, and the unique 3D open configuration, the optimal 3D-networked hybrid electrode exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity with extremely low overpotentials of 80 and 210 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Assembled as an electrolyzer for overall water splitting, this electrode delivers an impressive low onset potential of only 1.45 V and gives a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a very low cell voltage of 1.50 V, which is dramatically superior to the current state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. In combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, this study demonstrates that the strong coupling interactions between Ni2P and Ni3S2 synergistically optimize the electronic structure and tune the hydrogen (or water) adsorption energy, thus significantly enhancing the overall electrochemical water-splitting activity. Our work might shed some new lights on the design and fabrication of efficient and robust three-dimensional hybrid electrode materials for a variety of electrochemical applications.									264	17	0	0	14	0	269			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000440682100004

In the case of mixed metal oxides, however, this simplified scenario may be more complex. Non-active oxides containing electroactive metal species, like Pt- and/or Ru-doped SnO2 electrodes, are promising anode materials for the electrochemical treatment of waste-waters. This work analyzes the effect of Pt and Ru species on the nature of the electro-oxidative catalytic response of Ti/SnO2 anodes. For this purpose, the electro-oxidation of phenol and the competing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in NaOH have been chosen as model reactions. The different electrodes and reactions were characterized by cyclic voltammetry, electro- chemical impedance spectroscopy, and Tafel measurements. The obtained results reveal that both Pt and Ru introduce solid-state redox processes and catalyze the OER and the phenol oxidation onto Ti/SnO2-based electrodes. Nevertheless, the dopants induce quite different active behaviors in the mixed oxides. Pt practically does not affect the OER mechanism, but enhances its kinetics, so its electrocatalytic activity is associated with a specific adsorption of hydroxyl anions or phenolate on Pt sites, without participation of the irreversible Pt/PtOx couple (i.e. a "non-redox-active" behavior). On the contrary, Ru species involve various and highly reversible redox processes that accelerate and modify the rate-determining step of the OER, and that actively mediate in the phenol oxidation.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2196-0216			WOS:000461580800013

The anode was polarized in an electrolyte containing different concentrations of Mn2+ ions for 48 h to obtain a stable oxide film on the surface. The phase composition and morphology of the oxide layer formed on the Pb-0.07%Ca-1.25%Sn anode after polarization were characterized by the XRD, SEM, and EDS techniques. The influence of Mn2+ (=160 mg/L) on the electrochemical behavior of the Pb-0.07%Ca-1.25%Sn anode was investigated in 45 g/L Cu2+ and 180 g/L H2SO4 solution via cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic polarization, Tafel, and EIS measurements. In addition, the anodic weight loss, film formation, and corrosion mechanism of the anode are also proposed. The results reveal that the film formed on the Pb-0.07%Ca-1.25%Sn anode exhibited a gradient Pb|PbSO4|alpha-PbO2|alpha-PbO2-beta-MnO2 layer in the Mn2+-containing electrolytes. Then, during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the gradient layer was oxidized to MnO2, which was irregularly attached to the surface of the substrate and increased the roughness of the film. The presence of Mn2+ accelerated the corrosion of the anode in the electrolyte and reduced the anodic oxygen evolution potential. When the concentration of Mn2+ ions reached 160 mg/L, the corrosion rate was increased by 62.3% despite the anode potential decreasing by 30 mV.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0304-386X	1879-1158		WOS:000655253600024

Non-precious catalysts that can perform well in both HSo and deprotonation (DeP) are extremely desirable for a sustainable hydrogen economy. Herein, an affordable MoS2/NiPS3 vertical heterostructure catalyst is presented to synergize HSo and DeP for efficient water electrolysis. The internal polarization field (IPF) is clarified as the driving force of HSo in HER electrocatalysis. The HSo from the MoS2 edge to NiPS3 can activate the NiPS3 basal plane to boost the HER activity of the MoS2/NiPS3 heterostructure (112 mV vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2)), while for OER, the IPF in the heterostructure can facilitate the hydroxyl diffusion and render MoS2-to-NiPS3/P-to-S dual-pathways for DeP. As a result, the stacking of OER-inactive MoS2 on the NiPS3 surface still brings intriguing OER enhancements. With them serving as electrode couples, the overall water splitting is attested stably with a cell voltage of 1.64 V at 10 mA cm(-2). This research puts forward the IPF as the criterion in the rational design of HSo/DeP-unified non-precious catalysts for efficient water electrolysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000839952100001	35900215

The results indicated that the C=N and C=C groups appeared gradually with the increase of the temperature in air and nitrogen. The C=O groups appeared because of oxidative reaction in air. The C=N, C=C and C=O groups were all chromophores. The effect of conjugated C=N and C=C on the absorption of the visible light was shifted to longer wavelengths and indicated pi-pi* transition. There was a strong bathochromic effect as the number of C=C bonds were increased. The effect of C=O and -NH2 on the absorption of the visible light was shifted to longer wavelengths and indicated n-pi* transition. Oxygen could facilitate chemical reactions in air. Hence, the color of PAN in air was deeper than in nitrogen at the same temperature. The structural change of PAN in air was faster and more complex than in nitrogen. PAN fibers treated in air turned black after 230 degrees C. However, PAN fibers turned black at 350 degrees C in nitrogen. The MS and FTIR indicated that cyclization occurred before dehydrogenation during stabilization in air and nitrogen. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In the 0.06-0.3 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode potential region, H2O2 generation properties were significantly suppressed for the Ir(hkl) surfaces in comparison with Pt(111): only the Ir(100) revealed slight evolution of H2O2 at ca. 0.1 V. Conversely, the HOR activity trend of the Ir(hkl) was Ir(111) > Ir(100) > Ir(110), and the activity of Ir(111) is approximately 70% of that of Pt(111).

It was found that both Cr@IrO2 and Ni@IrO2 NPs, fabricated under basic conditions (pH = 13.5) denoted as Cr@IrO2-B and Ni@IrO2-B, respectively, were the best catalysts among the eight tested ones. Moreover, it was confirmed that variation in pH resulted in the changes in the surface area (defect structure), which were considered to be responsible for the changes in the catalytic properties of these NPs. For the oxygen evolution reaction, these NPs exhibited relatively smaller overpotential (eta) values than other tested Cr@IrO2- and Ni@IrO2-containing NPs. Furthermore, methylene blue degradation analysis and OH radical formation experiments by benzoic acid showed the same trend. Thus, we confirmed that the catalytic activity of transition metals doped IrO2 NPs fabricated under basic conditions can be improved.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2045-2322			WOS:000463869800036	30967622

State-of-the-art/commercial supports are based on forms of carbon black. However, carbon supports present disadvantages including corrosion in the operating fuel cell environment and loss, of catalyst activity. Here we review recent work examining the potential of different varieties of graphitic carbon nitride (gCN) as catalyst supports, highlighting their likely benefits, as well as the challenges associated with their implementation. The performance of gCN and hybrid gCN-carbon materials as PEMFC electrodes is discussed, as well as their potential for use in alkaline systems and water electrolyzers. We illustrate the discussion with examples taken from our own recent studies. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.									77	1	0	0	1	0	79			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000392566200006

At least four reaction pathways were identified: (1) direct absorption of uv light by conjugated phenolic groups to form the phenoxyl free-radical, (2) abstraction of phenolic hydroxyl hydrogen as a result of aromatic carbonyl triplet excitation to produce a ketyl and phenoxyl free-radical, (3) cleavage of non-phenolic phenacyl-alpha-O-arylethers to phenacyl-phenoxyl free radical pairs, and (4) abstraction of the benzylic hydrogen of the guaiacylglycerol-beta-arylether group to form the ketyl free-radical which in tum undergoes cleavage of the beta-O-4 aryl ether bond to produce an enol and phenoxy free radical.

Results show that TiC was reacted with zirconium or silicon compounds to generate evendistributed ternary ZrxTi1_ xC and quaternary (TixZr1_x)3SiC2 solid solution. The solid solution structure decreases the active oxidation of Si source, and reduces the depletion and evaporation of SiO2, forming a strengthened ZrO2-ZrTiO4-TiO2-SiO2 oxides layer with low oxygen diffusion coefficient, thereby enhancing the ablative property of the Zr-Ti-Si-C solid solution coatings.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0010-938X	1879-0496		WOS:000707311600002

As a new member of this system, superwettability-based chemical processes advance the applications of superwettability from single surface functions to a broader space. This review briefly introduces the latest developments in this field, including superwettability-based miniature reactors, highly effective catalytic electrodes, gaseous reactant channels and solid/liquid/gas triphase edge-growth. The reaction types cover electrochemical reaction, polymerization, crystal precipitation and catalytic process. We believe there are abundant unimaginable possibilities along with challenges in this newly emerging promising field. We hope this review will inspire researchers with different backgrounds to use superwettability concept in their reaction systems flexibly and provide a new exploitation for the superwettability system.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0218-625X	1793-6667		WOS:000626072100011

In this study, a three-dimensional and hierarchical nitrogen-doped magnetic carbon (Co@N-C) was developed via a facile one-pot carbonization of ZIF-67 with a green precursor of urea. Acid treatment was applied to remove the surface unstable cobalt nanoparticles (NPs) to avoid the potential leaching of toxic Co ions. Benefited from the rationally structural design of the carbon precursor and post-treatment with surface engineering, the derived Co@N-C can efficiently activate PMS for fast decomposition of bisphenol A (BPA) in aqueous solution, achieving high removal of total organic carbon (TOC) with trace cobalt leaching. The impacts of diverse reaction parameters on BPA degradation were systematically investigated. More importantly, density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the entrapped Co NPs can impressively modulate the electronic states of the interacted carbon regions, giving rise to enhanced carbocatalysis with synergistic promotion of N-doping. The embedded Co NPs also afford the carbocatalysts to be magnetic for an easy recycling. Additionally, comprehensive investigations of the evolution of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on the carbonaceous materials by competitive radical scavenging tests and in situ radical trapping with advanced electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) revealed the singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) as the dominant ROS rather than sulfate radicals. This study proposed a facile strategy for fabricating novel hybrid nanocarbon catalysts with N-doping and magnetic property and enables new mechanistic insights into carbocatalysis in AOPs, providing a promising system for green wastewater remediation.									112	4	0	0	56	0	114			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000445413900049

The flow-by configuration was the experimental arrangements used. Gold electrowinning was carried out with distinct cyanide solutions, namely: pure synthetic solution and synthetic solution with metallic impurities. This study aimed at investigating the effect of some parameters on the direct electrowinning of gold from cyanide solutions and a comparative study of two kinds of three-dimensional electrodes (stainless steel mesh and mild still wool). The current efficiency and the energy consumption were also analysed considering three competing cathodic reactions: gold deposition, oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution. A mathematical model was also evaluated aiming at determining, experimentally, the mass transport coefficients considering the reaction systems under study. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Herein, it is demonstrated that a Ni-based metal-organic framework [EG-MOF-74(Ni)] can be rapidly transformed into ultrasmall Ni-nanoparticles with different sizes (4-11 nm) encapsulated in graphitic carbon via the laser-scribing method. The synthesized sample shows the best electrocatalytic performances with excellent stability in alkaline electrolyte for oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions with overpotentials of 0.35/0.18 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) when the Ni particle size is approximate to 6 nm. This is because of its well-developed micro/mesoporous structure, high electronic transport, and large electrochemical active surface area. An electrolyzer with Ni-nanoparticles encapsulated in the graphitic carbon shows a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.6 V, which is comparable to the Pt/C and RuO2 counterparts. The laser-based synthesis can serve as a powerful tool for the size-controlled synthesis of various catalysts out of MOFs.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0934-0866	1521-4117		WOS:000674183700001

Herein we develop an ordered CoMno@CN superlattice structure as an efficient bifunctional water-splitting electrocatalyst, in which uniform Co-Mn oxide (CoMnO) nanoparticle are coated with a thin, continous nitrogen-doped carbon (CN) framework. The CoMnO nano-particles enable optimized OER activity with effective electronic structure configuration and the CN framework serves as an excellent HER catalyst Importantly, the ordered superlattice structure is beneficial for enhanced reactive sited, efficient charge transfer, and structural stability. This bifunctional superlattice catalyst manifests optimized current densities and electrochemical stability in overall water splitting outperforming most of the previously reported single or bifunctional electrocatalysts. Combining with a silicon with a silicon photovoltaic cell, this CoMnO@CN superlattice bifunctional catalyst enables unassited solar water splitting continously for similar to 5 days with a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of similar to 80%. Our discovery suggests that these transition metal oxide-based superlattices may serve as a unique structure modality for efficient bifunctional water splitting electrocatalysts with scale-up potentials.									312	12	0	0	11	0	314			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000365148500016	26496655

In this work, four different Co3O4 nanocatalysts which dominantly exposed {100}, {111}, {110} and {112} facets, respectively, were synthesized via hydrothermal method and further tested in C3H8 combustion. The catalytic activity of different crystal planes varied as the order of {111}>{100}>{110}>{112}. The Co3O4 catalyst with {111} facets exhibited the best catalytic performance with T-50 and T-90 as low as 209 and 239 degrees C, respectively. DRIFT and DFT calculations revealed that the facile activation of C-H bond on Co3O4 {111} planes is responsible for the high activity. Moreover, the higher activity of lattice oxygens and easy activation of gas phase oxygen could also contribute to the excellent catalytic performance.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000497857800023

Here by combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the periodic continuum solvation model based on modified-Poisson-Boltzmann (CM-MPB) electrostatics, we analyzed the ORR activity on a set of differently sized Pt nanoparticles in order to identify the optimum particles for a better designed catalyst. We show that Pt nanoparticles of similar to 2 nm size have the highest ORR mass activity, which is attributed to the variation of the effective reaction sites on the exposed {111} facet at the electrochemical conditions. We propose a type of a new nanocatalyst for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction based on the knowledge from large-scale first principles simulations on Pt nanoparticles. The new catalyst has inert metal Au as the frame for the Pt nanoparticle and exposed Pt{111} sites are the active site for oxygen reduction. Such an architecture can not only prevent the initial O corrosion at the edge sites but also significantly improve the activity. The theoretical work provides a promising new direction for the rational design of a stable and active ORR catalyst via nano-structure engineering.									41	2	0	0	4	0	42			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000325728400027	24077215

The structural evolution of C-S-H, radial distribution functions, chemical components, and distribution of Q ( n ) units in the system were analyzed to investigate the influence of GO on the early growth mechanism of C-S-H and compare the structural differences of C-S-H in the presence and absence of GO. The results showed that the proportion of silicon atoms bonded to bridge-site oxygen atoms in the C-S-H structure increased in the presence of oxygen-containing graphene groups. Ion adsorption in the GO surface layer led to an increase in the degree of polymerization of C-S-H. The nucleation and templating effects of GO were confirmed, revealing the intrinsic mechanism for the formation of GO-modified reinforced cementitious materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1606-5131	1605-8127		WOS:000764260000003

Optically active 2-hydroxy-2-phenylpropionic acid with 94% enantiomeric excess and 68% yield were obtained. The superior asymmetric electrocarboxylation performance may derive from the Fe4+ species and the increased lattice oxygen concentration on the surface of La0.7Sr0.3FeO3 (LSF-0.3) induced by Sr-doping, together with an accelerated electron transfer and an increased electrochemically active surface area. Here, perovskite oxide catalyst has an acid function, which is supplied by Fe4+ ions, can participate in the reaction by coordinating with acetophenone. Moreover, the LSF-0.3 has considerable stability and reusability. By cyclic voltammograms and contrast experiments, a mechanism was proposed for the asymmetric electrocarboxylation reaction.

Summaries of Proceedings								14	17						1980	1980	Vol oxidation was studied experimentally in small-scale laboratory tests with irradiated UO2 reactor fuels. In vol oxidation, UO2 fuel oxidizes to U3O8 above 480degC, accompanied by nearly quantitative evolution of tritium as HTO (water vapor). Tritium is an impurity in irradiated fuel formed by both fission and activation. During oxidation, the fuel expands, disintegrates into a fine powder, and separates from the cladding. The author developed new data on the effects on the vol oxidation reaction of (1) hull length, (2) oxygen concentration, (3) temperature, (4) agitation, (5) fuel density, and (6) fuel type and burnup. The reaction was studied by measuring weight gains, yields of U3O8, product densities and particle-size distributions, reaction rates, tritium release, and behavior of other off-gases (14C, 85Kr, and 129I).

Using the TPR (Temperature Programmed Reaction) method, we observed the decomposition temperature of sodium chlorate. One of the most effective metal oxide was prone to be nickel oxide. From the DTA (Differential Thermal Analysis) measurement, it was found that addition of metal oxides to sodium chlorate lowered the decomposition temperature to some extent, though the melting temperature did not change. Thus, the metal oxides added work as catalysts for the decomposition of the molten sodium chlorate, resulting in oxygen evolution at lower temperature.We discussed about the reaction mechanism between the metal oxides and sodium chlorate. As the temperature rises, the hopping electrons are generated at the surface of the metal oxides, then the positive holes are formed. The chlorate ions are drawn toward the holes to be oxidized to perchlorate ions, which yield to sodium chloride and oxygen at the successive step. Thus, the decomposition temperature of sodium chlorate depends upon the activation energy of hopping electrons in the metal oxides.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0369-4577			WOS:A1991GG20200004

We have studied the discharge parameters evolution during the different synthesis at several total pressures (5, 10 and 20 mTorr) and reactive gas concentrations (from 0 to 100%). For all the synthesis, the target current stays constant (40 mA). The discharge composition has been obtained by mass spectrometry in the glow discharge mass spectrometry mode and in the residual gas analysis mode. All the prepared films have been analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to measure the samples surface composition. On the other hand, we have modeled the films synthesis by a plasma-surface interaction model and obtained the sticking coefficients of the reactive species O and O-2 on the different substrate compounds Ag and Ag2O. We have shown that the main reactions are the reaction between the atomic oxygen and the metallic part of the substrate as we can previous intuitively. From all these results, we have correlated the discharge and the films compositions with the binding energy M-O and compared the results with those obtained for SnOx and TiOx in terms of reactivity for oxygen.

J	Wang, Li; Cao, Menghua; Ai, Zhihui; Zhang, Lizhi								Dramatically Enhanced Aerobic Atrazine Degradation with Fe@Fe2O3 Core-Shell Nanowires by Tetrapolyphosphate								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				48	6			3354	3362		10.1021/es404741x				MAR 18 2014	2014	In this study, the effects of an inorganic ligand tetrapolyphosphate on the molecular oxygen activation and the subsequent aerobic atrazine degradation by Fe@Fe2O3 core-shell nanowires were investigated systematically at a circum-neutral to alkaline pH range (pH 6.0-9.0). We interestingly found that the addition of tetrapolyphosphate could enhance the aerobic atrazine degradation rate 955 times, which was even 10 times that of the traditional organic ligand ethylenediamine tetraacetate. This tetrapolyphosphate induced dramatic aerobic atrazine degradation enhancement could be attributed to two factors. One was that the presence of tetrapolyphosphate strongly suppressed hydrogen evolution from the reduction of proton by Fe@Fe2O3 core shell nanowires through proton confinement, leaving over more electrons for the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) and the subsequent molecular oxygen activation. The other was that the complexation of tetrapolyphosphate with ferrous ions not only guaranteed enough soluble Fe(II) for Fenton reaction, but also provided another route to produce more center dot OH in the solution via the single-electron molecular oxygen reduction pathway. We employed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify the atrazine degradation intermediates and proposed a possible aerobic atrazine degradation pathway. This study not only sheds light on the promotion effects of ligands on the molecular oxygen activation by nanoscale zerovalent iron, but also offers a facile and green iron-based method for the oxidative atrazine removal.									139	15	0	0	74	0	145			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000333776000033	24527762

However, commercial elec-trolyzers require an inlet stream of pristine (reverse-osmosis purified) water, strongly coupling the energy storage approach to clean water sources [1]. Furthermore, in addition to the thermodynamic potential required to split water, an additional kinetic "overpotential" is required to drive the reaction at appreciable rates. This energetic penalty pri-marily stems from the sluggishness of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which has spurred a search for more in-depth understanding of the reaction mechanism to guide the design of more energy efficient catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0894-0886			INSPEC:20836408

Here, we propose a universal strategy of symbiotically growing atomically metal sites on the electronic state-rich metallic nanocrystals to tailor the electron structure of the catalytic active centers, enabling moderate adsorption capacity of oxo-hydroxy on the active centers toward high four-electron ORR selectivity. As a proof-of-concept experiment, three typical catalysts of atomically-dispersed Fe sites (Fe-SA/NC), symbiotic Fe complex by coupling atomically-dispersed Fe sites onto Fe nanocrystals (SBT-Fe-NC@SA), and Fe nanoparticles (Fe-NP/NC) were designed to flexibly alter the kinetic pathways of ORR. In situ synchrotron characterizations identified that a self-evolved Fe site adsorbed on the oxygen-bridge enhances the dinuclear Fe-Fe interaction under working conditions for SBT-Fe-NC@SA, which regulates the oxo-hydroxy adsorption capacity to be moderate for rapid breakage of O-O bond. As a result, the well-designed SBT-Fe-NC@SA exhibits the largest efficiency of four-electron ORR pathway and ultrahigh mass activity at the half-wave potential, tens of times those of control counterparts. These findings provide a unique perspective for optimally regulating intermediates adsorption capacity of active sites toward superior activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000852773400002

While tremendous progress has been made on the perspective of optimizing the catalyst-reactant interaction, the influence from other properties has received relatively less attention to date. These properties are normally originated from the intrinsic solid-state properties and can be circumstantially influential on the reaction activity and reaction mechanism. In particular, transition metal oxides (TMOs) possess complex inherent features that enable a wide variety of catalytically influential properties. Therefore, understanding the inherent features in TMOs and mastering the strategies to take full advantage of them will bring opportunities for further advances. Here we provide an overview of the inherent features in TMOs and conceptually discuss how they can alter the catalytic behaviors in electrocatalysis. Perspectives to take full advantage of these features are also proposed for a better design of TMO-based electrocatalysts.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000758012900001

We adopt an interface engineering strategy to synthesize a hierarchical FeNiP/MoOx integrated electrode with multi-interface grown on monocrystalline NiMoO4 nanorods. Such catalyst exhibits remarkable alkaline HER performance with a low overpotential of 97 mV at the current density of 100 mA cm(-2) and sustainable durability over 20 h. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that interfaces among Fe2P, Ni5P4, and MoOx can efficiently activate H2O molecules and facilitate H desorption. Moreover, employing FeNiP/MoOx/NiMoO4/NF as a cathode, the cell voltage as low as 1.62 V to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm(-2), with admirable durability over 20 h for alkaline water splitting (1.0 M NaOH + 0.5 M NaCl). This work offers a new avenue to rationally design a 3D robust, cost-effective catalyst with multi-interface for large-scale practical hydrogen production.									15	0	0	0	0	0	14			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000727786000002

Here, the synergetic effects of disordered surface layer and Ag-Pt nanoalloy over TiO2 nanosheet on the improved photocatalytic activity was proposed. The nanocomposites exhibited enhanced photocatalytic performance in selective oxidation of benzylamine to imine under UV-visible irradiation. More importantly, the synergetic effect of nanoalloy and surface oxygen vacancy boosted the generation of singlet oxygen in the selective oxidation of benzylamine. The regulation of thickness of disordered surface layer and composition of Ag-Pt nanoalloy over nanosheet TiO2 promoted the separation efficiency and mobility of charge carriers, resulted from the changed electronic structure of surface layer and nanoalloy. These findings provide an avenue for the design of nano-composite photocatalysts combined defect engineering and nanoalloy modification to improve the photocatalytic activity.									15	0	0	0	4	0	15			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000594831300002

The HER, seemingly one of the simplest electrochemical reactions, has served for decades to bridge the gap between fundamental electrocatalysis and practical catalyst design. However, there are still many open questions that need to be answered before it would be possible to claim that design principles of catalyst materials are fully developed for the efficient hydrogen production. In this review, by summarizing key results for the HER on well-characterized electrochemical interfaces in acidic and alkaline media, we have broadened our understanding of the HER in the whole range of pH by considering three main parameters: the nature of the proton donor (H3O+ in acid and H2O in alkaline), the energy of adsorption of H-ad and OHad, and the presence of spectator species. Simply by considering these three parameters we show that great deal has already been learned and new trends are beginning to emerge, giving some predictive ability with respect to the nature of electrochemical interface and electrocatalytic activity of the HER.

Compared to their bulk counterparts, 2D atomically thin, layered transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs or MX2) nanosheets exhibit excellent electronic and optical properties, outstanding mechanical flexibility, and exceptional catalytic performance. As a representative of 2D materials, MX2 holds great promise in many potential applications, especially in energyrelated applications. Here, a brief overview of atomically thin layered MX2 nanosheets applied in energy storage and conversion systems is presented. Firstly, the crystal structures and phases, morphologies, and synthesis methods of MX2 are discussed. Sequentially, the achieved progress on atomically thin MX2 in energy-related applications (i.e., the hydrogen-evolution reaction, oxygen-evolution reaction, CO2 electrochemical reduction, electrochemical capacitors, lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and lithiumsulfur batteries) is systematically discussed. Finally, the conclusions and some prospects regarding atomically thin MX2 for applications in the field of energy-storage systems are provided.									83	5	0	0	1	0	84			2366-9608			WOS:000417488900002

This ancient pathway has revolutionized life on Earth. The most important event was the development of oxygenic photosynthesis. It had a tremendous impact on the Earth's geochemistry and the evolution of living beings, as the rise of atmospheric molecular oxygen enabled the development of a highly efficient aerobic metabolism, which later led to the evolution of complex multicellular organisms. The mechanism of photosynthesis has been the subject of intensive research and a great body of data has been accumulated. However, the evolution of this process is not fully understood, and the development of photosynthesis in prokaryota in particular remains an unresolved question. This review is devoted to the occurrence and main features of phototrophy and photosynthesis in prokaryotes. Hypotheses concerning the origin and spread of photosynthetic traits in bacteria are also discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

After heat treatment, foaming was only observed for precursors with a % of theoretical density above 94%. This density limit corresponds to the transition from interconnected to closed porosity, confirming that isolating porosity and enveloping the foaming agent in the matrix are vital to successful foaming. In Al-TiH2 samples compacted to low density, oxygen ingress into the structure occurs leading to reaction with TiH2 and additionally, oxidation of the Al powder. On melting, the molten Al fails to envelop the TiH2 particles and as the TiH2 decomposes the gas escapes through the network of connected porosity. By compacting Al-TiH2 samples to high density the porosity becomes isolated, preventing the exposure of TiH2 to oxygen in the environment and hindering the passage of the evolved gas from the compact. On melting, a continuous liquid is formed which envelops the TiH2 particles and facilitates foam evolution.					3rd International Latin-American Conference on Powder Technology3rd International Latin-American Conference on Powder Technology	NOV 26-28, 2001NOV 26-28, 2001	Assoc Brazilian CeramAssoc Brazilian Ceram	SANTA CATARINA, BRAZILSANTA CATARINA, BRAZIL	4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0255-5476		0-87849-912-1	WOS:000182605200050

The influences of carbonization temperature and doping densities on electrocatalytic activity for ORR are investigated. Doping densities of the nitrogen and sulfur are varied using various ratios of ZIF-8 to thiourea and optimized for the best performance for ORR. The synthesized carbon-based catalysts are physicochemically characterized by XRD, TGA, BET, SEM, and XPS. The resulting NSDPC materials exhibit enhanced ORR activity compared to pristine ZIF-8 and the samples after carbonization without doping. In addition, it shows excellent tolerance for methanol cross-over and higher cycling stability than those of commercial Pt/C. This improvement in the catalytic activity of NSDPC is attributed to the mesoporous structure and new active sites derived from the introduction of nitrogen and sulfur.									27	0	0	0	1	0	27			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000467663700033

The phase composition, lattice parameter and the microstructure of products after treatment at different temperatures and under different conditions were analyzed by XRD, SEM and TEM. The results show that TiN/ Al2O3 composite ceramics can be produced in coke bed via aluminothermic reduction reaction or in flowing nitrogen. However, the treating temperature and atmosphere affects the evolution of aluminothermic reaction and morphology of products obviously. The TiN content, grain size and lattice parameter of TiN in products in coke bed were much lower than those in nitrogen stream. Thermodynamically it is confirmed that metal Al reacts with oxygen in coke bed while it is involved in aluminothermic reduction reaction, which caused the lack of Al taking part in the aluminothermic reaction and led to a surplus rutile in the products.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1002-185X			WOS:000249866900208

Large hydrogen demands could be tackled by splitting water into storable hydrogen and oxygen. Here, we report a novel nanomaterial that consists of a layered double hydroxide (LDH) based on Co-Fe and well-dispersed Co-Fe hydroxide nanoparticles (NPs) that is capable to perform the water oxidation reaction (WOR) effectively. Also, we compared the electrocatalytic behavior of this layered material against a Co-Ni LDH in WOR. Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) results show that the Co-Fe LDH catalyst exhibits lower overpotential (i.e., similar to 200 mV less, in aqueous 0.1 M phosphate buffer at neutral pH) than Co-Ni LDH. We attribute this behavior to a synergistic effect between the Co-Fe hydroxide NPs and Co-Fe LDH; different morphology of the Co-Fe hydroxide in contact could lead to a change in the electronic structure of the surface.									50	4	0	0	4	0	51			1452-3981			WOS:000351080000058

Moreover, no detectable potential decay is observed at 50 mA cm(-2) for at least 15 h, revealing its excellent long-term stability. Finally, a highly efficient overall water splitting cell is assembled with amorphous Fe-doped CoWO4 as a bifunctional electrocatalyst.

In this work, elemental incorporation, disorder engineering and material hybridization were applied to molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) simultaneously to realize a high-level synergistic optimization for both active sites and electric conductivity, achieving highly efficient hydrogen-evolving performance finally. Benefitting from the synergistic optimization, the vertically aligned oxygen-doped MoS2/carbon cloth catalyst shows an ultralow onset overpotential of 90 mV to initiate the HER process, and an extremely high catalytic current of 225 mA cm(-2) was measured at an overpotential of 300 mV. Not only that, superior stability was also achieved, making this novel catalyst promising for practical applications such as electrolytic water splitting and a co-catalyst for photocatalytic/photoelectrochemical hydrogen production.

Both the intrinsic activity and antioxidation property of Ni are remarkably enhanced after Cu doping. A volcano-type relation between HOR activity and Cu doping content is revealed. The maximum activity is found at ca. 40 at. % Cu, with the exchange current density 4 times higher than that of pure Ni.

Because it is bright, nearby, unreddened, and has a well-determined chemical composition, this star avoids most of the issues involved in age determinations for globular clusters. Using the Fine Guidance Sensors on the Hubble Space Telescope, we have measured a trigonometric parallax of 17.15 +/- 0.14 mas for HD 140283, with an error one-fifth of that determined by the Hipparcos mission. Employing modern theoretical isochrones, which include effects of helium diffusion, revised nuclear reaction rates, and enhanced oxygen abundance, we use the precise distance to infer an age of 14.46 +/- 0.31 Gyr. The quoted error includes only the uncertainty in the parallax, and is for adopted surface oxygen and iron abundances of [O/H] = -1.67 and [Fe/H] = -2.40. Uncertainties in the stellar parameters and chemical composition, especially the oxygen content, now contribute more to the error budget for the age of HD 140283 than does its distance, increasing the total uncertainty to about +/- 0.8 Gyr. Within the errors, the age of HD 140283 does not conflict with the age of the Universe, 13.77 +/- 0.06 Gyr, based on the microwave background and Hubble constant, but it must have formed soon after the big bang.									65	1	0	0	0	0	66			2041-8205			WOS:000315187800012

The optimal working conditions for the application of this procedure are discussed. The properties of the resulting overlayers were determined through voltammetry, X-ray analysis, infrared spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric and differential thermal analysis, and SEM micrography. The explanation of the entire process is given in terms of sequential electrochemical oxidation and reduction reactions involving different Co-containing species. The electroreduction reactions including the HER, play an important role in determining the characteristics of the resulting Co3 O4 overlayer.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0021-891X			WOS:A1991FN33500007

NiCo2O4/CNF and NiMn2O4/CNF are prepared according to an optimized electrospinning method using polyacrylonitrile (PAN) as carbon nanofibers precursor. After the thermal treatment at 900 degrees C for 1 h in the presence of helium and the subsequent one at 350 degrees C for 1 h in air, nanosized metal oxides with a spinel structure supported on carbon nanofibers are obtained. The physico-chemical investigation shows relevant difference in the crystallite size (9 nm for the NiCo2O4/CNF and 20 nm for the NiMn2O4/CNF) and a more homogeneous distribution for NiMn2O4 supported on carbon nanofibers. These characteristics derive from the different catalytic effects of Co and Mn during the thermal treatment as demonstrated by thermal analysis. The OER activity of NiCo2O4/CNF and NiMn2O4/CNF is studied in a single cell based on a zero gap anion exchange membrane-electrode assembly (MEA). The NiMn2O4/CNF shows a better mass activity than NiCo2O4/CNF at 50 degrees C (116 A g(-1) @ 1.5 V and 362 A g(-1) @ 1.8 V vs. 39 A g(-1) @ 1.5 V and 253 A g(-1) @ 1.8 V) but lower current density at specific potentials. This is the consequence of a lower concentration of the active phase on the support resulting from the need to mitigate the particle growth in NiMn2O4/CNF. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The results show there are 24 different protein spots in 2-DE, which belong to 14 proteins and are classified into 6 functional categories by mass spectrum identification. Wherein, 42% proteins are involved in the light-dependent reactions. After treatment with the sHSP26 antibody (AT-sHSP26),the expressions of proteins related to photosynthesis,including ATP synthase alpha,beta and gamma subunits,oxygen-evolving enhancer protein 1 (OEE1),chlorophyll a/b binding protein,cytochrome b6/f complex iron-sulfur subunit, photosystem I (PSI) reaction center subunit IV and iron-sulfur center, were down-regulated. This study indicated that sHSP26 protected these proteins and played pivotal roles in plant photosynthesis. In addition, the addtion of AT-sHSP26 significantly reduced the oxygen evolution rate of PS?? under heat stress, suggesting that sHSP26 can eventually improve the maize tolerance to heat stress.			以玉米(Zea mays L.)品种郑单958幼苗第2个新展开的叶片为试验材料,运用双向电泳(2 - DE)和质谱分析等技术,确定高温胁迫下与sHSP26相关蛋白及其与叶绿体关系。质谱鉴定结果显示,胶上存在24个蛋白质差异点,属于14个蛋白质,归为6种功能类别,其中42%蛋白质参与光反应。与其对照相比,用sHSP26抗体(AT-sHSP26)处理后,与光合作用相关蛋白(ATP合酶alpha,beta和gamma亚基、放氧增强子蛋白(OEE1)、叶绿素a/b结合蛋白、细胞色素b6/f复合体铁硫亚基、光系统I反应中心亚基Ⅳ和铁硫中心蛋白)表达下调。并且叶绿体PS Ⅱ的放氧速率明显降低。表明sHSP26通过调控光合作用相关蛋白,从而在一定程度上对叶绿体起到保护作用,最终影响玉米叶绿体的耐热性。						0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1000-2340			CSCD:5625228

The activities of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are essential for the Zn-air battery (ZAB) application. Here, we synthesized the hollow ball spinel structural of Pt/CoFe2O4-C, which exhibited high ORR performance, close to commercial Pt/C. Simultaneously, the OER performance of Pt/CoFe2O4-C was slight better than that of the commercial IrO2. Thus, the prepared (wt:0.1) Pt/CoFe2O4-C was applied in the homemade ZABs, whose open circuit voltage was as1.483 V, approaching the performance of the mixture of the commercial Pt/C and IrO2 (1.508 V). Moreover, the discharge/charge voltage gap for the sample was as low as 1.288 V at 50 mA cm(-2), outperforming the mixture of Pt/C and IrO2 (1.51 V). Remarkably, the small voltage difference of Pt/CoFe2O4-C was shown as 0.401 V after 12 h Zn-air battery charge/discharge testing under 30 mA cm(-2).									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000636690800004

The water hyacinth is carbonized to porous carbon; the addition of Fe increases pore diameter, graphitization degree, total N and pyridinic N content. The characterizadons indicate that the doping N contributes great on ORR activity, yet the residual Fe species themselves show inconspicuous catalytic effect on ORR. The NFe-WHG with the above features displays superior ORR activity in alkaline media and comparable ORR activity to commercial Pt/C in acidic media. Due to the graphite matrix and that most of the Fe species have been removed, the NFe-WHG shows excellent stability in both alkaline and acidic media with excellent anti-methanol and anti-CO performances.

Herein we develop a scalable electrodeposition route to fabricate amorphous nickel-iron(oxy)hydroxide nanosheets directly onto a 3D partially exfoliated graphite foil electrode. The integrated electrode combines the high OER catalytic activity of NiFe-based materials and the excellent electric conductivity of the carbon substrate, while facile ion transport and gaseous product (O-2) diffusion are guaranteed by its hierarchical structure. The electronic structure of the Ni catalytic center, which shows critical effects in determining the catalytic activity, can be controlled through Fe incorporation and/or tuning the electrodeposition potential window. The optimal electrode catalyzes the OER process with a low overpotential of 214 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) current density in 1 M KOH. The Tafel slope is as small as 21 mV dec(-1) so it is capable of delivering high current densities of 500 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of only 251 mV. The OER can be prolonged to 100 h at 10 mA cm(-2) and 48 h at 500 mA cm(-2). The composite shows great potential towards large-scale and long-term practical applications.									53	2	0	0	2	0	53			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000416340300021

Electrochemical energy conversion devices are a promising option for green energy supply, although the challenge associated with electrocatalysis have caused increasing complexity in the materials and systems, demanding further research and insights. In this field, scanning probe microscopy (SPM) represents a specific source of knowledge and understanding. Thus, our aim is to present recent findings on electrocatalysts for electrolysers and fuel cells, acquired mainly through scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and other related scanning probe techniques. This review begins with an introduction to the principles of several SPM techniques and then proceeds to the research done on various energy-related reactions, by emphasizing the progress on non-noble electrocatalytic materials.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000607298400005	34163583

The initial curing protocols are considered, which were chosen based on the isothermal heat release properties of both reaction systems. Increasing initial temperature contributes to the cumulative heat release, strength development and zeolite formation of both geopolymers, especially the fly ash based, but results in slightly worse pore characteristics. The formation of zeolite is rapid, indicating a simultaneous process with geopolymerisation. During sample handling and aging, natural carbonation took place. Two kinds of carbonation processes are detected: reaction of CO2 with mobile alkalis on the one hand and with framework oxygen atoms of the alunimosilicate gels on the other hand.									42	2	0	0	1	1	45			0958-9465	1873-393X		WOS:000453620900011

We review several areas where the transfer of an electron and proton is tightly coupled and discuss model systems that can provide an experimental basis for a test of PCET theory. In a PCET reaction, the electron and proton may transfer consecutively (ET/PT) or concertedly (ETPT). The distinction between these processes is formulated, and rate-constant expressions for the two reaction channels are presented. Methods for the evaluation of these rate constants are discussed that are based on dielectric continuum theory. Electron donor hydrogen-bonded-interface electron acceptor systems displaying PCET reactivity are presented, and the rate-constant expressions corresponding to the ETPT and ET/PT channels for several model reaction complexes are evaluated.									733	6	0	0	153	1	739			0066-426X			WOS:000076541300012	9933908

In this work, a carbon nanotubes (CNTs) encapsulated cobalt-cobalt phosphide on reduced graphene oxides material (Co-Co2P@CNT/rGO) was engineered via a simple high-temperature phosphating process. The as-gained catalyst was well-characterized, and we found that the metallic Co is essential to the formation of CNTs. Additionally, the catalyst was further employed in HER process. Compared with the metallic cobalt-free sample (Co2P@C/rGO), the Co-Co2P@CNT/rGO showed a significantly boosted HER activity with a Tafel slope of 55.43 mV dec(-1) and an exchange current density of 5.62 x 10(-3) mA cm(-2). Besides, owing to the confining effect of CNTs, the Co-Co2P@CNT/rGO showed excellent stability during the 20 h stability test.

Combined information, provided by thermal energy helium scattering and angle resolved ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy, show that recombination of the OHgamma, sub-state, in the range 235-255 K produces a new phase consisting of a mosaic of large and ordered oxygen domains and OHdelta domains. The former present a (2 x 1) geometric structure with -Ag-O- added rows aligned along the [001] direction while the latter show a (1 x 2) structure with -OH-Ag- chains placed along the [1(1) over bar0$] direction. Further recombination of the OHdelta sub-state starring around 260 K and leading to the final O(3 x 1) phase around room temperature, proceeds through a continuous rearrangement between large ordered oxygen domains and OH disordered domains.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0039-6028			WOS:A1997WE53100026

However, corrosion problems associated with lead anodes cost millions of dollars for industries annually. Cast and rolled lead-silver and lead-calcium anodes were tested under typical nickel electrowinning conditions. Effects of sulfuric acid and chloride concentrations on overall corrosion performance of the anode materials were investigated. Moreover, oxygen evolution reaction rate and overpotential were determined for specific electrode material/solution conditions. Galvanostatic experiments were performed so the actual conditions that the electrodes are exposed to were simulated. Corrosion rates of the electrodes were calculated using the discharge plateau recorded during OCP measurements following the galvanostatic experiments. SEM and XRD were used to study the correlation between the surface morphology of the electrodes, their phase composition and their corrosion rates. (C) 2011 The Electrochemical Society.

However, two issues are needed to be clarified for further development: ORR on CMCs produces more H2O2 via 2e(-) process than that for NMCs in acidic condition, and the active sites for ORR of CMCs are still under debate. H2O2 formation on NMCs was thought to be activated by O-2 adsorption on metal surfaces. Contrarily, the results of present study indicate that an O-2 molecule would approach the hydrogen site on CMCs to form an OOH- ion which subsequently reacts with H+ to form a H2O2. The calculated electrochemical potentials, kinetics, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) binding energy support well the new mechanism. Moreover, we found that the active sites for ORR are actually dependent on specific ORR process and the working potential range. The present work provides important insights into ORR for electrochemical devices.									57	3	0	0	7	0	58			1932-7447			WOS:000405761600017

Degradation of B[a]P and the generated transformative products on clay mineral are monitored by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique. Hydroxyl-B[a]P and B[a]P-diones are observed during the transformation of B[a]P under dark condition. B[a]P-3,6-dione and B[a]P-6,12-dione are the main products under visible light irradiation. B[a]P transformation is accompanied by the formation of EPFRs, which are quantified by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. With increasing reaction time, the concentrations of the produced EPFRs are initially increased and then gradually decrease to an undetectable level. The deconvolution results of EPR spectra reveal formation of three types of organic radicals (carbon-centered radicals, oxygen-centered radicals, and carbon-centered radicals with a conjugated oxygen), which also co-exist. Correspondingly, visible-light irradiation promotes the formation and the decay of these EPFRs. The produced B[a]P-type EPFRs induce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide (O-2(-center dot)) and hydroxide radicals ((OH)-O-center dot), which may cause oxidative stress to cells and tissues of organisms. The toxicity of degradation products is evaluated by the livability of human gastric epithelial GES-1cells. The toxicity is initially increased and then decreases with the elapsed reaction time, which correlates with the evolution of EPFRs concentrations. The present work provides direct evidence that the formation of EPFRs in interaction of PAHs with metal-contaminated clays may result in negative effects to human health.									42	2	0	0	31	0	42			0160-4120	1873-6750		WOS:000470239200017	31128436

However, it is still difficult to directly synthesize MOF nanosheets. Here we for the first time report a new bottom-up strategy for in situ synthesis of high-quality ZIF-67 nanosheets with the salt-template assistance. The as-prepared ZIF-67 nanosheets exhibit a uniform morphology and ultrathin structure with a thickness of 4.5 nm. Furthermore, because of the highly open structure, larger surface area, more accessible active sites and smaller diffusion barrier compared with bulk-sized MOFs, the directly carbonized Co, N-doped nanoporous carbon nanosheets also greatly boost the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). More importantly, the general synthesis process indicates that this effective salt-template confined bottom-up strategy can be expanded to synthesize other ultrathin 2D MOF nanosheets with extensive applications in gas separation, catalysis, sensors, and energy storage and conversion.									126	12	0	0	10	0	128			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000410597200032

The composite layers were characterized by optimum growth of the mass of the composite constituent, and had very well-developed surface morphologies. The phase composition of composite layers was investigated by X-ray diffraction.These layers were subjected to cyclic cathodic-anodic polarization from the hydrogen evolution potential to the oxygen evolution potential for 1 h in order to attain electrochemical activation of the composite constituents. Next, using single-sweep voltammetry, an electrochemical characterization of the performance of these layers in 1 M KOH solution was conducted. The results were compared with analogous dependencies obtained in solutions containing aliphatic alcohols C1 - C4. The effects of temperature and rate of polarization of the electrode on the behavior of j -E curves were ascertained. The electro-oxidation of alcohols in alkaline environment was characterized by calculating the reaction rate constants and the activation energies on the composite surface layers.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0040-6090			WOS:A1993MG45700021

Their surface features were modified by changing pyrolysis conditions (ramp and holding time). The obtained materials, after an extensive surface characterization, were tested as ORR catalysts in an alkaline medium. They exhibited a high catalytic activity with the number of electron transfer close to 4 (3.99) and a kinetic current density of 8 mA cm(-2). Their excellent performance was linked to the hierarchical porosity, high integrity of the carbon phase of an enhanced graphitization degree, and to the presence of catalytic centers. The samples prepared at a long pyrolysis time were very active in the ORR due to the developed micropores and the high graphitization degree of the carbon phase. Mild acid washing decreased the number of electron transfer by removing metal-based catalytic centers and by negatively affecting the integrity of the carbon phase covering the pore walls.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000589891500015

Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and cobalt acetate are used as carbon-nitrogen and cobalt precursors to synthesize the cobalt-doped NPC. The KOH activation primarily enhances the activity of NPCs in the ORR by making them highly porous and forming pyrrolic nitrogen in the carbon network. It is the subsequent cobalt doping process that not only induces more transitions of pyridinic to pyrrolic nitrogen but also generates new active sites of oxide and carbide forms (Co3O4 and CoxC) on the NPCs. A further reduction of hydrogen peroxide can occur on the cobalt-doped NPCs leading more favorably to the four electron pathway. The cobalt-doped NPC has an ORR activity comparable to the commercial Pt catalyst, but it shows higher stability and greater tolerance to methanol poisoning.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2046-2069			WOS:000363416400026

In recent years, many understandings of the mechanism have been achieved through simulating experi ments . Types of organic matters, temperature, pressure, catalysis and aqueous medium all have influences on the prop erties of hydrocarbons generated. Increase of pressure can impede or delay thermal evolution and pyrolysis of organic maters; water is the source of hydrogen and oxygen for pyrolysis reaction; and catalysis can not only change components of reaction products, but also influence the reaction mechanism. Kinetics is also an important factor influencing pyrol ysis of organic matters, which provides a new way to identify various source rocks. In the future, attentions should be paid to the study of characteristics of pyrolysis of organic matters under higher pressure condition, and the development and application of field experimental apparatus.			地球上的油气资源主要是由地球深部的有机质热裂解形成，近年来的模拟实验对其机理获得很多认识，表明了有机质类型、温度、压力、催化作用以及水介质都对油气产物的特征存在影响。压力增加可能会阻碍或延迟有机质的热演化和裂解；水是热裂解反应的氢源和氧源；催化作用不仅可以改变产物的组成特征，而且对反应机理存在影响。动力学因素也是影响有机质裂解反应的一个很重要的方面，为不同烃源岩的判识提供了一种新思路，并建议进一步开展对更高压力下有机质的热演化机制、特征的实验模拟研究。						1	5	0		1	0	6			0253-9985			CSCD:1628257

Experimental conditions of the oxidation experiments were selected as the temperature range of 500-750 degrees C and the oxygen partial pressure range 10(-4)-45 Pa. The evolution of nucleation and growth of oxide whiskers or grains on the surface of iron specimens under the ESEM was recorded. The characteristics of some specimens were further examined after oxidation by post-analysis. Three sets of experimental results and other relative micrographs are shown. In the light of the surface morphology and textures of the oxide growths in the micrographs, their growth mechanism and reaction kinetics are discussed. Finally, a plausible physical model for oxidation of iron is suggested.									5	3	0	0	2	0	8			0934-0866			WOS:A1997WN06700006

Although transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have made great achievements in reducing the overpotential of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), improving oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance that is relatively lagging in view of relatively large overpotentials and high kinetics energy barriers is yet to be achieved. Herein, we propose an extremely convenient and practical approach to prepare iron-doped cobalt phosphide nanoparticles (Fe-CoxP NPs) via a one-step method by introducing an iron element in the in situ synthesis of a metal-organic framework (ZIF-67) and then subjecting to a phosphate treatment. The as-obtained Fe-CoxP showed an excellent OER and acceptable HER activities. In particular, for OER, the optimized Fe-doped CoxP (Fe0.27Co0.73P) exhibits an ultra-low overpotential of 251 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a negligible electrocatalytic degradation after 3000 CV cycles, and time over 40 h-reliant current density stability. When employed as cathode and anode electrodes in water splitting, the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) can be achieved at a potential of 1.68 V. Our facile synthetic strategy and innovative ideas are undoubtedly beneficial to the design and construction of advanced water-splitting electrocatalysts.									39	1	0	0	3	0	39			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000496535000005	31633132

Four initial chlorophyll concentrations, two light attenuation levels, and two illumination conditions were modeled to study their effects on the dynamics of O-2 evolution and H-2 production. The results indicate that two side illumination is the best design for light penetration into a flat plate reactor. While for single side illumination condition, an optimal combination of the initial cell concentration, light intensity, and reactor width may have to be considered for high H-2 production.

Herein, we propose a 3D hierarchical Fe(PO3)(2)@Cu3P heterostructure nanotube arrays on Cu foams for promising HER catalysts. The HER performance can be tuned by changing FeCI3 concentrations and the optimized cathode exhibits excellent HER activity in 1 M KOH with a low overpotentials of 108 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 84 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, this electrode delivers high electrochemical durability with stable operation for 24 h. Such high performance can be ascribed to the unique hierarchical heterostructure with large electrochemical surface area, synergistic effect and fast electron transport. Our study can provide new inspiration for rational construction of copper-based hierarchical nanomaterials for HER electrodes and other energy-related applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

By considering the performance of these reactions as a function of platinum particle size (2.1-15 nm) under high mass transport conditions in acids, we find that the activity is composed of two components which vary in a defined way with the particle size. Geometrical considerations and electrokinetic modelling suggest that these two components correspond to the response of edges/vertices and the response of facets (Pt(100) and Pt(111)). Edges and vertices are much more active towards the hydrogen reaction. This assignment also rationalises the poor performance of platinum in alkaline environments. We predict that "ideal" particles made up of only edges/vertices would allow fuel cells and electrolysers to operate with only 1 mu g(Pt) cm(-2) - about two to three orders of magnitude lower than what is currently used.									55	2	0	0	1	0	55			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000415070100051

To improve the activity, stability and catalytic efficiency, the methods for immobi-lizing CYP450s on a biosensing platform and biosynthesis of complex natural products were reported. However, these biotechnologies are hampered by the limited O2 availability. In this review, we sum-marize and highlight a panorama of the classical methods for biosensor, nanoreactor with confinement function and cascade reactions, bioimaging for detecting CYP450s activity and biosynthesis of complex natural and unnatural products. Then, the gas-solid-liquid interface (triphase interface) is introduced for CYP450s immobilization to overcome limited O2 availability and drive the catalytic cycle of CYP450s-H2O2 system by in situ generating H2O2 and controlling interfacial wettability, which affords a conve-nient way for their synthetic application.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we combine electrochemistry, surface spectroscopy, and high-resolution microscopy to show that Ni3S2 undergoes self-limiting oxidative surface restructuring under ORR conditions to form an amorphous surface film conformally coating the Ni3S2 crystallites. The surface film has a nominal NiS stoichiometry and is highly active for ORR catalysis. Density functional theory calculations suggest that, to a first approximation, the catalytic activity of nickel sulfides is determined by the Ni-S coordination numbers at surface-exposed sites through a simple geometric descriptor. In particular, Ni surface sites with three S nearest neighbors, formed via reconstruction of the Ni3S2 surface, provide an optimal energetic landscape for ORR catalysis. By providing a framework for understanding catalytic activity on reconstructed amorphous surface phases, the work enables the rational design of high-performance electrocatalysts based on kinetically labile, earth-abundant materials.									62	3	0	0	4	0	62			2542-4351			WOS:000425301500019

One pathway toward greater energy density is through the use of Li-rich layered oxides. The capacity of this class of materials (>270 milliampere hours per gram) has been shown to be nested in anionic redox reactions, which are thought to form peroxo-like species. However, the oxygen-oxygen (O-O) bonding pattern has not been observed in previous studies, nor has there been a satisfactory explanation for the irreversible changes that occur during first delithiation. By using Li2IrO3 as a model compound, we visualize the O-O dimers via transmission electron microscopy and neutron diffraction. Our findings establish the fundamental relation between the anionic redox process and the evolution of the O-O bonding in layered oxides.									516	25	1	0	42	0	521			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000366591100056	26680196

Herein, we introduce a generic dealloying procedure to fabricate nanoporous spinel high-entropy oxides (HEO) (AlCoFeMoCr)(3)O-4 as the OER catalysts, incorporated with highly dispersed Pt or PtPdCuAgAu clusters/nanoparticles of similar to 1.5 nm in diameters as the ORR catalysts on the porous HEO. Our combined experimental results and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations clearly indicate that the ORR activity of Pt clusters can be enhanced and stabilized through strong interactions with the HEO substrates, and at the same time, the presence of Pt can boost the OER performance of the HEO. In particular, the nanoporous AlCoFeMoCr/Pt composite exhibits a comparable OER activity as the best reported data, while its ORR activity exceeds the performance of commercial Pt/C in alkaline solutions. We expect such multicomponent HEO/metal composite systems would provide a new combinatorial materials design path to ensure multiple catalytic functionalities.									33	1	0	0	1	0	33			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000629032600023

In this paper, catalytic reforming technology was employed for reutilize of wood vinegar with a Ni/CoAl2O4 catalyst. In order to clarify its trigger mechanism, instantaneous gases yield and components evolution were investigated at initial stage. Results showed that nearly all components in wood vinegar could efficiently participate in catalytic reforming reaction. The initiation of the catalytic reforming reaction was attributed to the cleavage of the O-H bonds caused by the adsorption of O atoms to oxygen vacancies on the surface of the catalyst. The C-H bonds could also be broken under the action of oxygen vacancies to produce hydrogen; however, the metallic carbide accompanying was the primary cause of catalyst deactivation.

It was found that the susceptibility of the single crystals to the onset of pitting attack in the chloride solution varied in the order (111)>(110)>(100). This was evident from pitting potential and induction time data, where the most noble pitting potential values and the longest induction periods were recorded for the (100) surface. This was explained in terms of differences in the surface energy of (111), (110) and (100) planes. It was also found that cathodic reduction reactions (hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions) proceeded at a greater rate on the (100) surface. In addition, the time delay between the addition of indium ions to solution and the onset of activation of the immersed electrode by the indium species was shorter for the (100) surface. This was attributed to the more efficient incorporation of indium into the (100) lattice. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Two series of samples were produced in the presence (modified samples: PITX) and in the absence of Triton X-100 (unmodified samples: PT) at bath temperatures ranging from 25-100 degrees C. Higher current efficiencies, mechanical strength and more adhesion to Ti substrates were found for modified samples. Results confirm an increase in the overpotential for oxygen evolution during electrodeposition process in the presence of Triton X-100. It is suggested that the accumulation of oxygen species and the growth of crystals could be affected through the aqueous network of the self-assembled surfactants on the electrode surface. A higher overpotential for oxygen evolution reaction was also observed for electrodes made of PTX samples in sulfuric acid solution. Results of the voltarnmetric experiments and those from laboratory-designed test cells have confirmed a higher charge/discharge performance of modified samples towards the PbO2/PbSO4 transformation in aqueous sulfuric acid solutions.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has shown reduced morphological defects of PTX samples at all bath temperatures. This was in agreement with X-ray diffractograms, showing more crystalline appearance and regularity, compared to those of unmodified samples. The sample obtained under optimized conditions (synthesis in the presence of Triton X- 100 at a bath temperature around 100 degrees C, had a higher degree of crystallinity and electrochemical activity. The enhanced characteristics of this sample is attributed to its special morphology due to creation of large number of small micropores, strong incorporation of hydrogen species and enhanced proton diffusivity as confirmed by SEM, thermogravirnmetric analysis (TGA) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS).

In WO3-x/NC, WO3-x nanoparticles with a size of about 3 to 6 nm are dispersed homogenously in a 3D nitrogen doped carbon matrix. The existence of oxygen vacancies has been confirmed by electron spin resonance (ESR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). WO3-x/NC exhibits remarkable photocatalytic activity for the degradation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Under visible light irradiation it can completely degrade formaldehyde and benzene in 90 min. The durability of WO3-x/NC is also excellent. After 8 successive reaction cycles the removal rate stays as high as 92%. More importantly, WO3-x/NC also exhibits outstanding visible and near-infrared light driven photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity. The prominent VOC removal and H-2 production properties can be attributed to the oxygen vacancies from WO3-x and the good conductivity of the nitrogen doped carbon matrix. We hope WO3-x/NC can be applied as an effective material in air purification and H-2 energy development.									26	4	1	0	2	0	29			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000427157000015

The most important component of the PEC to achieve efficient water splitting is a photo active anode that could effectively absorb photons and deliver holes for the oxygen evolution reaction. Hematite has many attributes that make it a good candidate material for a photoanode but it also has some deficiencies. This article reviews the state-of-the-art hematite-based photoanodes, with special emphasis on attempts made by researchers to overcome its drawbacks. The numerous research reports are categorized under distinct strategies such as nanostructuring, elemental doping, surface passivation, cocatalyst application, conducting template incorporation and heterostructures which are possible pathways to improve the performance of hematite. The scientific understandings of the operating mechanisms for each strategy are systematically presented and discussed, and the improvements achieved by different approaches are compared. Some cutting-edge strategies, such as heterojunctions, could be important and hematite based heterostructures are discussed. A developing interest in an emerging material, Fe2TiO5 is also discussed and some of the important benefits of this material are presented. Finally, the importance of scaling up the technology is discussed and attention is drawn to some possible challenges on scaling up. The paper concludes with some future technology directions and prospects for hematite-based photoanodes.									32	1	0	0	1	0	32			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000460045500001

In this article, a ternary FeCoNi oxygen evolution catalyst was prepared by simple electrodeposition on nickel foam. The composition and structure of the catalyst was characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD and XPS. The performance of the catalyst was measured in alkaline solution. The results show that the ternary catalyst has behaved high activity and stability for water electrolysis. The onset overpotential is as low as 0.20 V (vs. RHE) and the overpotential is as low as 0.37 V (vs. RHE) at the high current density of 300 mA/cm(2) when the catalyst was employed as an anode for water electrolysis. Moreover, the stability of the anode is very good at high current density. The potential retains at almost the same value after more than 8 h continuous electrolysis and the SEM measurement confirms that the catalyst was not decomposed or exfoliated from the nickel foam.

This study was performed at Ti/Ru0.3Ti0.7O2 anode by adding known concentrations of Cr in solution by applying different current densities. The results demonstrated that dissolved Cl-2, HClO, ClO-, chlorite, chlorine dioxide and chlorate can be electrochemically formed. The concentration trends of dissolved Cl- and chlorite indicated that the electrochemical route was responsible for their presence in the bulk solution, and these active species are responsible of the formation of the other chlorine species. By using Ti/Ru0.3Ti0.2O2 as anode, the efficient treatment of real effluent was favored by applying 25, 50 and 75 mA cm(-2) in presence of NaCl (1.25 g L-1), achieving higher elimination of organic matter, ranging from 80% to 86%. Results clearly have demonstrated that the oxygen evolution inhibition depends predominantly on the specific electrochemical species formed in association with pH, nature of electrode and applied current.

In this work, we develop a solution based synthetic method to combine these two materials into CZTS-AuAg heterodimers at low temperature. These CZTS-AuAg heterodimers demonstrate prominent catalytic activities toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline medium, and they show a 20-fold increase in mass activity compared to the single component of AuAg nanocrystals. Meanwhile, compared to the CZTS-Au heterostructures, the addition of Ag has remarkably increased the four-electron selectivity of the catalysts. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis reveals that the promising properties are mainly attributed to the electronic coupling between the semiconductor and the noble metal domain in the heterostructure and the alloying effect of Au-Ag. This work proves that it is possible to maximize the catalytic activity through not only the alloying method but also its interaction with a semiconductor using a metal alloy semiconductor heterostructure.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1932-7447			WOS:000398247500033

In this work, we use ab initio calculations to demonstrate that a facile mechanism for recharging Li2O2 exists. Rather than the direct decomposition pathway of Li2O2 into Li and O-2 suggested by equilibrium thermodynamics, we find an alternative reaction pathway based on topotactic delithiation of Li2O2 to form off-stoichiometric Li2-xO2 compounds akin to the charging mechanism in typical Li ion intercalation electrodes. The low formation energy of bulk Li2-xO2 phases confirms that this topotactic delithiation mechanism is rendered accessible at relatively small overpotentials of similar to 0.3-0.4 V and is likely to be kinetically favored over Li2O2 decomposition. Our findings indicate that at the Li2O2 particle level there are no obstacles to increase the current density, and point to an exciting opportunity to create fast charging Li-air systems.									156	7	0	0	9	1	160			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000323810800007		
J	Li, W; Wang, N; Li, BQ								Process analysis and mechanism of multi-stage hydropyrolysis of coal								CHEMICAL JOURNAL OF CHINESE UNIVERSITIES-CHINESE				23	9			1767	1771						SEP 2002	2002	The mechanism of multi-stage hydropyrolysis of coal was probed through detailed analysis of products of hydropyrolysis with different holding methods. The results showed that the holding method significantly affects the product distributions, thus making an apparent difference in hydrogen utilization efficiency. The holding temperature should be about 350-500 degreesC during which more free radicals are produced rapidly. Pore-riched structures are formed at the holding stage at 350 degreesC due to the evolution of large amount of volatiles, which is favorable to the subsequent hydrogenation reaction. The holding at a low temperature favors the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen-containing groups, leading to the formation of phenol and avoiding the formation of water at a high temperature. The cleavage of chemical bonds in the char is mainly dependent-on the pyrolysis temperature. The effect of holding stage is to change the distribution and components of products via stabilizing the free radicals and hydrogenating the heavier products.									1	1	0	0	0	0	1			0251-0790			WOS:000178056800034

Covalent functionalization of group 14 layered materials can lead to significant tuning of their properties. While optical and electronic properties of germanene, silicene, and their derivatives have been studied in detail previously, there is no information on their electrochemistry and toxicity. Herein, electrochemical applications of 2D siloxene, germanane, and methylgermanane, specifically for detection of an important biomarker, dopamine, as well as catalyzation of oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions, which are important in energy applications, are explored. Among the three materials, germanane portrays most superior properties for the electrochemical applications mentioned. All three materials possess fast heterogeneous electron transfer rates, relative to bare glassy carbon electrodes. In addition, toxicity studies of these materials are conducted to gain insights on their possible harmful effects toward human health. The results of this study show siloxene nontoxic while germanane and methylgermanane impose dose-dependent toxicity. Interestingly, methylation successfully reduce the toxicity of methylgermanane at lower concentrations. These studies provide fundamental insights into electrochemical and toxic properties of functionalized group 14 layered materials for future electrochemical applications.									18	0	0	0	2	0	18			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000536858100030

Catechol can produce o-benzoquinone by releasing two electrons via a reversible reaction which could be exploited for fuel cell construction. Thus, for conversion of catechol into o-benzoquinone is crucial and requires a robust catalyst. In the present article, we propose IrOx immobilized ITO surface for efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of catechol. The catalysis and kinetics have been investigated using Cyclic Voltammetric (CV) technique in acidic medium. The Ir(III) species involves one electron transfer redox reaction on the ITO surface and the conversion of Ir(III) to Ir(IV) has been identified to catalyze catechol oxidation reaction. The concentration of the electro active Ir species on the ITO surface was calculated to be (3.32 +/- 0.22) x 10(-9) mol cm(-2).									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000767861200011

Research on OER and ORR catalysts has attracted a lot of attention. The limited single-functional catalysts can be expanded as bi-functional catalysts to meet the extra requirement of preparing high-performance catalysts. In this study, we prepared Co-ZIF/CNF in which carbon nanofibers uniformly encapsulated Co- nanoparticles by electrospinning and simple pyrolysis. Co-ZIF/CNF contains both CoOx and Co-Ny active sites, showing bifunctional activity for OER and ORR. The optimized catalyst Co-ZIF1.5/10CNF2 has a low OER overpotential of 390mV, an onset potential of 0.93V and a half-wave potential of 0.85V of ORR, exhibiting an outstanding OER and ORR catalytic performance. The catalyst retained 87.53% of its current after 12h, showing great stability. This paper provides a new strategy for designing and preparing OER and ORR bifunctional catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1095-7103		MEDLINE:36240688	36240688

By a simple two-step dealloying process, the active components in a Pt/Ni/Al ternary alloy were sequentially leached out in a highly controllable manner, generating a novel nanoporous surface alloy structure. Characterized by an open bicontinuous spongy morphology, the resulting nanostructure is interconnected by similar to 3 nm diameter ligaments which are comprised of a Pt/Ni alloy core and a nearly pure Pt surface. In the absence of any catalyst support, these nanoporous surface alloys show much enhanced durability and electrocatalytic activity for ORR as compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. At a high potential, such as 0.9 V versus RHE, nanoporous Pt/Ni surface alloys show a remarkable specific activity of 1.23 mA cm(-2). These nanomaterials thus hold great potential as cathode catalysts in PEMFCs in terms of facile preparation, clean catalyst surface, and enhanced ORR activity and durability.									148	10	0	0	8	0	151			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000299046100018

The best known oxidation of lower alkane is the selective oxidation of n-butane to maleic anhydride over vanadyl pyrophosphate catalyst. Maleic anhydride is a versatile molecule that lends itself to many applications demanding multi-functionality. Major use of this molecule is in the manufacture of unsaturated polyester. It is used as the starting material for 1,4-butanediol and tetrahydrofuran production. It is also a component of several copolymers of interest in the area of engineering plastics. Vanadyl pyrophosphate system possesses sites able to perform the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane. It has got centers that can perform allylic oxidation with high specificity. The various steps involved in the reaction mechanism include oxidative dehydrogenation followed by allylic oxidation, 1,4-oxygen insertion and electrophylic oxygen insertion.This paper reviews the various aspects of n-butane oxidation to maleic anhydride available in the literature. The aspects encompassed in the paper include evolution of commercial processes, reaction kinetics and mechanism, vanadyl phosphate preparation, structure and characterization and the role of promoters.					10th Annual Saudi-Japanese Symposium on Catalysts in Petroleum Refining and Petrochemicals10th Annual Saudi-Japanese Symposium on Catalysts in Petroleum Refining and Petrochemicals	NOV 19-20, 2000NOV 19-20, 2000	Japan Petr Inst; Japan Petr Energy CtrJapan Petr Inst; Japan Petr Energy Ctr	KING FAHD UNIV PETR & MINER, RES INST, DHAHRAN, SAUDI ARABIAKING FAHD UNIV PETR & MINER, RES INST, DHAHRAN, SAUDI ARABIA	0	0	0		0	0	0					*************	WOS:000172341200023

Models of elementary reactions are proposed by taking into account a potential barrier due to the strain field near the reacting species. First, substoichiometric species ([O]/[Mg]<1) form in a non expanded zone; then excess oxygen by comparison with the amount necessary to form stoichiometric MgO oxide and over stoichiometric clusters are responsible of the highly expanded zone observed. The decrease of deformation and of excess oxygen which occurs at last is related to an evolution toward more compact clusters.					36th Annual Colloquium on Metallurgy: Changes in Phase and Microstructure36th Annual Colloquium on Metallurgy: Changes in Phase and Microstructure	JUN 22-23, 1993JUN 22-23, 1993	INST NATL SCI & TECH NUCL; UNIV PARIS XI; ECOLE MINES PARIS; ECOLE CENT ARTS & MANUFECTURES; ECOLE NATL SUPER CLIM PARISINST NATL SCI & TECH NUCL; UNIV PARIS XI; ECOLE MINES PARIS; ECOLE CENT ARTS & MANUFECTURES; ECOLE NATL SUPER CLIM PARIS	INST NATL SCI & TECH NUCL, GIF SUR YVETTE, FRANCEINST NATL SCI & TECH NUCL, GIF SUR YVETTE, FRANCE	4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1155-4339			WOS:A1994NK45900006

Here, we report the synthesis of nickel boron nanoparticles supported on Vulcan carbon (Ni-B) via a simple, yet scalable, two-step chemical reduction-annealing strategy. The results of the electrochemical measurements suggest that the overpotentials of Ni-B-400 are 114 and 215 mV (in 1 mol L-1 KOH) at current densities of 10 and 40 mA cm(-2), respectively, indicating an exceedingly good electrocatalytic activity in the HER. More importantly, Ni-B maintains a current density of 7.6 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 0.15 V for 20 h in the durability test. The excellent HER activity of Ni-B-400 is derived from the small particle size and the expanded lattice of Ni, which can optimize the hydrogen absorption energy and enhance the electrocatalytic properties.

Nevertheless, decreasing the Ir content to less than 50 at% while maintaining or even enhancing the overall electrocatalytic activity and durability remains a grand challenge. Herein, by dealloying predesigned Al-based precursor alloys, it is possible to controllably incorporate Ir with another four metal elements into one single nanostructured phase with merely approximate to 20 at% Ir. The obtained nanoporous quinary alloys, i.e., nanoporous high-entropy alloys (np-HEAs) provide infinite possibilities for tuning alloy's electronic properties and maximizing catalytic activities owing to the endless element combinations. Particularly, a record-high OER activity is found for a quinary AlNiCoIrMo np-HEA. Forming HEAs also greatly enhances the structural and catalytic durability regardless of the alloy compositions. With the advantages of low Ir loading and high activity, these np-HEA catalysts are very promising and suitable for activity tailoring/maximization.									133	10	0	0	2	0	136			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000489142800001	31596058

More importantly, it also shows enhanced anti-poisoning performance in methanol, NaNO2 and NaHSO3 electrolytes, compared to those of commercial Pt/C and Pd/C catalysts. Mechanism studies reveal that the synergistic effect between Pd and more oxygen-philic and less poison-philic Si nanoclusters largely abbreviate the absorption of poisoning species on the active sites. This strategy also improves the methanol-tolerant performance of Pt based catalysts, providing a versatile strategy for the fabrication of methanol-tolerant ORR catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000810387200006

The distinctive structure characteristics endow it unique electronic structure, uniform distributed pores and excellent chemical stability. A novel GDY-supported NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) composite was successfully prepared for the first time. By taking advantage of the increased surface active areas and improved conductivity, the designed hierarchical GDY@NiFe composite exhibits outstanding catalytic activity that only required a small overpotential about 260 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The nanocomposite shows excellent durability in alkaline medium implying a superior OER electrocatalytic activity. It is anticipated that the as-prepared GDY@NiFe composite electrocatalyst provide new insights in designing graphdiyne-supported electrocatalyst materials for oxygen evolution application.									77	6	0	0	4	0	78			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000457067300014	29767495

The results were systematically analysed in terms of the general parameters (light absorption, charge separation, and surface for catalysis) that govern the photocurrent density response of metal oxide as photoanode in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell. ZnO electrodes surface were modified with different concentration of FeOOH nanoparticles using the spin-coating deposition method, and it was found that 6-layer deposition of glycine-FeOOH nanoparticles is the optimum condition. The glycine plays an important role decreasing the agglomeration of FeOOH nanoparticles over the ZnO electrode surface and increasing the overall performance. Comparing bare ZnO electrodes with the ones modified with glycine-FeOOH nanoparticles an enhanced photocurrent density can be observed from 0.27 to 0.57 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V-RHE under sunlight irradiation. The impedance spectroscopy data aid us to conclude that the higher photocurrent density is an effect associated with more efficient surface for chemical reaction instead of electronic improvement. Nevertheless, the charge separation efficiency remains low for this system. The present discovery shows that the combination of glycine-FeOOH nanoparticle is suitable and environmentally-friend cocatalyst to enhance the ZnO nanorod electrode activity for the oxygen evolution reaction assisted by sunlight irradiation.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000510511400001	31943643

Here we report a new method for enhancing oxygen evolution reation (OER) activity of LaNiO3 perovskite by a thin FeOOH coating. The resulting LaNiO3@FeOOH demonstrates remarkably enhanced OER activity, much better than those of the pristine LaNiO3 or the benchmark RuO2. The excellent OER activity is attributed mainly to the optimized adsorption energy for oxygenated species and fast charge transfer kinetics. Similar enhancement effect of the FeOOH layer is also observed for other perovskite oxides, suggesting that the developed approach could be an effective strategy towards enhancing OER activity of many perovskite catalysts. Moreover, when the LaNiO3@FeOOH is used as the OER catalyst in a rechargeable Zn-air battery, the overpotential of the cell is reduced while maintaining long cycling life, demonstrating the promising prospect for practical applications.									48	1	0	0	3	0	49			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000501613700026

The polarization characteristics of anode and cathode fuel cell assemblies, and also composition and gas release rate of gaseous products of anode reactions are studied. It is shown that the maximum voltages in the open cell circuit are obtained when the oxygen-carbon dioxide ratio in the cathode gas mixture corresponds to stoichiometric reaction coefficients that ensure replenishment of ions in electrolyte. However, the maximum current density values were obtained with a low carbon dioxide content. It is found that at high current values, anode potential fluctuations are observed. It is shown that carbon monoxide is the product of anode processes, along with carbon dioxide. The carbon monoxide content grows with temperature. The carbon dioxide content grows with increasing current in the fuel cell and with growing carbon dioxide content in cathode gases. The release rate of carbon oxidation products nonlinearly depends on the current value in the fuel cell. It is concluded that there is interrelation between the mass-exchange processes in the fuel cell, which is determined by the balance between cathode gas incoming into the reaction zone, the number of molecules generated during fuel oxidation, molecule dissolution and diffusion into the cathode region, and also the amount of gas released in the form of bubbles.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1810-2328	1990-5432		WOS:000300782800002

Thus, strong electronic and geometric effects are induced, which are known as effective tools to tune activity. With the example of the oxygen reduction reaction, we show that by utilising a data-driven discovery cycle, the multidimensionality challenge raised by this catalyst class can be mastered. Iteratively refined computational models predict activity trends around which continuous composition-spread thin-film libraries are synthesised. High-throughput characterisation datasets are then used as input for refinement of the model. The refined model correctly predicts activity maxima of the exemplary model system Ag-Ir-Pd-Pt-Ru. The method can identify optimal complex-solid-solution materials for electrocatalytic reactions in an unprecedented manner.									28	0	0	0	1	0	28			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000616648800001	33372334

The iron-magnesium galvanic pair exposed to aqueous NaCl solution was adopted as model system for this purpose. Mg2+ ion concentration and pH profiles were investigated using ion selective electrodes, containing a liquid membrane and Sb/Sb2O3 as sensor elements, respectively. Oxygen consumption at the substrate related to the cathodic reaction was also monitored with the antimony-based electrode though operated amperometrically. Data show a major production of hydroxyl anions at the cathodic sites as result of the oxygen reduction half-reaction, whereas in the vicinity of the magnesium surface pH is greatly affected by the anodic dissolution process instead. The later produces the release of metal cations accompanied by hydrogen evolution. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									43	0	0	0	2	0	43			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000315171100037

A contribution from the electrolyte to the potential of the reaction centers in ii is included in the ab initio Hamiltonian. The reversible potential predicted for i based on model ii is 0.04 V, close to the standard hydrogen electrode value of 0 V, and the predicted activation energy at the predicted reversible potential is 0.076 eV, close to the literature value of 0.12 eV for the apparent activation energy. The theoretical results validate the possibility of the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism being followed on platinum.									64	1	0	0	2	0	65			1520-6106			WOS:000222639900042

The nitrogen species derived from the PANI building blocks act as bridging sites to bind with metal ions, which provides a strong coupling effect for the in situ growth of CuCo2S4. At the same time, the mesh structure of PANI divides the growable location into smaller blocks. Compared with a mesh plane with uniformly distributed nitrogen sites, only a small portion of the nitrogen sites are located on the narrow-width fence structure, which may make it difficult for CuCo2S4 to grow onto the fence structure, thereby limiting the self-growth space and confining CuCo2S4. The uniformly distributed growth sites direct CuCo2S4 to grow perpendicular to the plane while limiting their growth size. The excellent structural features further enhance the electrochemical oxygen evolution activity, and the oxygen evolution overpotential at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) is only 291 mV, which is superior to that of the currently known cobalt-copper-based catalyst materials. In addition, the stable structure provides excellent electrode cyclic stability. The preparation of hierarchical self-supporting cobalt-copper bimetallic sulfide nanoarrays provided a reference direction for other transition metal catalytic materials and provided a basis for industrial applications.									24	0	0	0	1	0	24			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000475468100028	31215579

Computational chemistry (e.g. using DFT) developed significantly in that direction and allowed the fast prediction of (electro) catalytic activity trends and improved the general understanding of adsorption at electrochemical interfaces. However, building a reliable and comprehensive picture of electrocatalytic reactions undoubtedly requires experimental assessment of adsorption energies. In this way, the results obtained by computational chemistry can be complemented or challenged, which often is a necessary pathway to further advance the understanding of electrochemical interfaces. In this work an interfacial descriptor of the electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction, analogue to the adsorption energy of the Had intermediate, is identified experimentally using in situ probing of the surface potentials of the metals, under conditions of continuous control of the humidity and the gas exposure. The derived activity trends give clear indication that the electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction is a consequence of an interplay between metal-hydrogen and metal-water interactions. In other words it is shown that the M-H bond formation strongly depends on the nature of the metal-water interaction. In fact, it seems that water dipoles at the metal/electrolyte interface play a critical role for electron and proton transfer in the double layer.									49	0	0	0	3	0	49			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000405422900008	28636684

PbO2, owing to its high conductivity, good corrosion resistance and low cost, is widely used as an excellent coating material. In present research, a novel composite Ti/TiO2-NTs/PbO2 material was synthesized through a facile anodization, annealing, electrochemical reduction and galvanostatic deposition. The surface morphology, internal structure and the mechanisms of TiO2-NTs enhancing electrochemical performance were discussed. The results show that the self-organized high aspect ratio TiO2-NTs with diameter of similar to 120 nm and length of similar to 8 mu m were obtained on Ti substrate. The Ti/TiO2-NTs/PbO2 composite material exhibits excellent oxygen evolution performance and good stability in Zn electrowinning simulation solution (50 g L-1 Zn2+, 150 g L-1 H2SO4) at 35 degrees C. Its oxygen evolution overpotential is only 630 mV under current density 50 mA cm(-2), which is 332 m lower than that of Pb-0.76 wt% Ag (eta = 962 mV) and only increases 22 mV after 5000 cycles of CV scanning. Its outstanding electrochemical performance is mainly ascribed to the introduction of TiO2-NTs in Pb(CH3COO)(2) media since it refines the crystal grains, increases the electrochemical surface area, greatly reduces the charge transfer resistance (25.4 omega cm(2) to 2.337 omega cm(2)) and enhances corrosion resistance. Therefore, the Ti/TiO2-NTs/PbO2 material prepared in Pb(CH3COO)(2) medium may be an ideal anode for Zn electrowinning.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4				2046-2069		WOS:000614616900026	35423157

Herein, a series of model catalysts with a composition of LaFe0.8M0.2O3 (M = Al, Ga, Fe, and Sc) were designed to shed light on the structure- activity relationship. Combined experimental results and DFT calculations verify that the tilting degree of the FeO6 octahedron rather than the Fe-O bond length plays a dominant role in modulating the oxygen activity. Reducing the octahedral tilting via doping redox-inert cations with a smaller radius can greatly enhance the Fe-O bond covalency and reduce the oxygen vacancy formation energy. This not only contributes to the activation of reactants but also accelerates the oxygen mobility. Consequently, LaFe0.8Al0.2O3 with the smallest FeO6 octahedral tilting (6.6 degrees tilting) manifests superior syngas productivity that is 70% higher than that of LaFe0.8Sc0.2O3 (9.5 degrees tilting) with simultaneously better CO2 conversion for chemical looping dry reforming of methane. This discovery highlights the importance of geometric effect in adjusting the oxygen activity, paving an avenue for developing prospective redox catalysts for chemical looping processes and reactions proceeding via a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000813546500001

Particularly, identifying the main obstacle in solar water oxidation is intriguing for efforts to promote the energy conversion efficiency. Herein, we take WO3 and cesium treated WO3 as prototypical models to disclose the reaction kinetics of photocatalytic water oxidation and found that the lack of long-lived surface holes is the bottleneck in the photocatalytic process. Analysis of the kinetic barriers of the surface catalytic reactions indicates that the water oxidation on WO3 is kinetically fast, whereas surface treatment of WO3 with cesium carbonate would enlarge the reaction energy barrier but unexpectedly increase the photocatalytic water oxidation rate. A further comparison of the charge dynamics by surface photovoltage and intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy reveals that the increased surface hole density due to the suppression of charge recombination accounts for the improvement in the photocatalytic activity.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1948-7185			WOS:000508473400010	31777248

PCC 6803 through comparisons of genomic sequences and conserved gene sequences of the LMW HSPs. Hsp16.6 was isolated using PCR and cloned into the pGEMT plasmid. Hsp16.6 showed a significant increase in transcription after heat shock at 42 degrees C that indicated hsp16.6 was a heat shock gene. To determine the role that hsp16.6 plays in the heat shock response, a mutant Synechocystis cell line was generated. Cell growth and oxygen evolution rates of wild type and mutant cells were compared after heat shock. Results showed significantly decreased cell growth rates and a 40% reduction in oxygen evolution rates in mutants after heat shock treatments. These data indicate a protective role for hsp16.6 in the heat shock response.									46	2	0	0	47	0	50			0343-8651			WOS:000077055800007	9806978

However, the as-prepared light yellow THS exhibit inferior photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution from water splitting due to the poor crystallization of TiO2 and the existence of oxygen vacancies. Significantly, a subsequent thermal treatment improves the crystallinity of THS, reduces the oxygen vacancies, and thereby enhances the photocatalytic performance. It demonstrates that the sample annealed at 550 degrees C (THS550) exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity, about 5 times higher than that of commercial TiO2 nanoparticles (C-TiO2). Moreover, the THS550 sample loaded with 1 wt% Pt exhibits an hydrogen evolution rate as high as 17.9 mmol h(-1)g(-1), and the corresponding apparent quantum efficiency has been determined to be 28.46% under 350 nm light irradiation.

J	Kim, Su-jin; Lee, Seung-Cheol; Lee, Chongmok; Kim, Myung Hwa; Lee, Youngmi								Evolution of silver to a better electrocatalyst: Water-assisted oxygen reduction reaction at silver chloride nanowires in alkaline solution								NANO ENERGY				48				134	143		10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.03.041				JUN 2018	2018	Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of great interest in various areas, including energy conversion. This paper presents the simple synthesis and characterization of one-dimensional silver halides nanowires (AgClNW and AgBrNW) as an electrocatalyst for ORR in alkaline media, as well as an investigation of the ORR pathway at AgCl. AgClNW and AgBrNW were prepared via a galvanic replacement reaction (GRR) between silver nanowires (AgNW) and a halide precursor. AgClNW exhibited excellent ORR catalytic activity that was comparable to or better than that for commercial Pt (20 wt% Pt loading on Vulcan carbon), demonstrating potential to replace Pt-based catalysts. A scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) analysis supports the existence of an associative ORR pathway at AgCl, and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the high ORR activity of AgCl is possibly attributed to the up-shifted Ag d-band center energy in AgCl as well as the assistance of adsorbed water molecules.									21	2	0	0	1	0	21			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000432604600016		
J	Ma, Zhong; Liu, Guofu; Lu, Yonggang; Wang, Junfeng; Zhang, Hui								Improved redox performance of Fe2O3/Al2O3 oxygen carrier via element doping in chemical looping combustion								FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY				224						107030	10.1016/j.fuproc.2021.107030		SEP 2021		DEC 15 2021	2021	In chemical looping combustion, iron-based oxygen carriers often experienced serious phase segregation, which reduced the cyclic stability of the oxygen carriers. In this work, Fe2O3/Al2O3 (FA) was doped with different metals (Sr, La and Ce) to improve the redox performance during cyclic reactions. The mechanism of dopants on FA was explored by experimental research and characterization analysis. The promotion effect of different dopants on the redox performance of FA followed the sequence: Sr > La > Ce. It was shown that the deactivation of Ce-FA and La-FA was obvious in 20 cycles. The results of 100 successive cycles indicated that the surface structure of Sr-FA remained stable and no sintering was observed. The Sr-FA achieved stable oxygen carrying capacity (4%) in 100 redox cycles. The characterization results indicated that the addition of Sr could effectively increase the concentration of oxygen vacancies, thus inhibiting the phase segregation of FA. The enrichment degree of surface Fe of FA, Sr-FA, La-FA and Ce-FA were 135.7%, 43.47%, 128.0% and 140.0%, respectively. The results of this study provide guidance for the preparation of iron-based oxygen carriers with high redox performance.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0378-3820	1873-7188		WOS:000709549000002

Natural radioactivity and formation of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere: Decay of radioactive K-40 and radiolysis of ocean water								PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH				346						105786	10.1016/j.precamres.2020.105786				AUG 15 2020	2020	The important role of radioactivity in the conversion of primary hydro- and atmosphere is substantiated considering the decay of 40 K isotope in seawater. By now, the total energy resulting from the decay of 40 K in the ocean amounts to 6.3 x 10(26) J. The calculations show that the concentration of oxygen formed over the last 3.8 Ga is approximately 8 x 10(17) kg, i.e., it is of the same order of magnitude as the content of oxygen in the modern atmosphere. The ocean was an intermediate reservoir in which oxygen was formed and which was purified from toxic components. The radiation provides the threshold concentrations of oxygen (Urey, Pasteur, and Berkner-Marshall points) important for the development of oxygen-breathing life. The radical and ionic products of water radiolysis induced chemical transformations of the compounds dissolved in the ocean. The calculations show that their total concentration over a period of 3.8 Ga was approximately 0.3 mol L-1.Seawater radiolysis resulted in water purification, saturation with oxygen, and formation of simple organic molecules.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0301-9268	1872-7433		WOS:000561242000024

Herein, a novel ternary alloy catalyst supported on carbon, PdIrAu/C, has been synthesised, characterised and compared to the binary PdIr/C to show how the addition of Au improves the stability of the catalyst. Transmission electron microscopy was utilised to analyse electrode structure as a function of the synthesis method, showing the optimum annealing temperature, of those tested, to be 400 degrees C, while inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry provided analysis of the degradation of the two catalysts, confirming the PdIrAu/C catalyst is more stable at potentials similar to those at a fuel cell anode than PdIr/C.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1040-0397	1521-4109		WOS:000573848100001

The models developed provide a framework for extracting kinetic information from cyclic voltammograms (CVs) obtained in conditions under which the substrate or cosubstrate is consumed in a multielectron redox process, as is particularly prevalent for very active catalysts that promote energy conversion reactions. Such determination of rate constants in the total catalysis regime is a prerequisite for the rational benchmarking of molecular electrocatalysts that promote multielectron conversions of small-molecule reactants. The present analysis is illustrated with experimental systems encompassing various limiting behaviors.									24	1	0	0	1	0	24			0027-8424			WOS:000413520700040	29073048

Based on the reported results, it is concluded that the BH4- electro-oxidation is determined by the catalyst used and BH4- concentration at the catalytic sites. Hydrogen evolution during the DBFC operation can be suppressed by: (I) using a composite catalyst or a hydrogen storage alloy as the anode catalyst via a quasi 8-electron reaction; (2) using metals with high hydrogen over-potential, such as Au and Ag as the anode catalyst via an intrinsic 8-electron reaction; and/or (3) modifying and optimizing fuel composition.The single cell and stack performance of DBFC is mainly influenced by the hydrogen evolution, the BH4- cross-over, and the BH4- tolerance of cathode catalyst. The development of non-platinum cathode catalysts and stacking technology is on the way. The reported results are encouraging but some problems still remain to be further investigated and solved.

The h-BCN with high specific surface area showed a strong chemical affinity towards metal ions due to the "lop-sided" densities characteristic of ionic B-N bonding, enabling the creation of metal/h-BCN hybrid layered structures with unique properties. As exemplified here by Co/h-BCN for water oxidation catalysis, after intercalating cobalt ions in the h-BCN host, the photocatalytic activity of the resultant layered hybrid is optimized due to their synergic catalysis that promotes charge separation and lowers reaction barriers. This finding promises a new nobel-metal-free nanocompsite using cost-acceptable and earth-abundant sustances for photocatalytic OER, and enables the facile design of duel catalytic cascades by merging transition metal catalysis with h-BCN (photo) catalysis for energy and sustainability.									52	5	0	0	4	0	52			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000383099800005		
J	Niu Dongfang; Ding Yong; Ma Zhixing; Wang Minghui; Liu Zhou; Zhang Bowen; Zhang Xinsheng								Effects of Surface Modification of Carbon Nanofibers on Their Electrocatalytic Activity for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction of Water Electrolysis								ACTA CHIMICA SINICA				73	7			729	734		10.6023/A15030195				JUL 15 2015	2015	The effects of surface modification of CNF on their electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) were investigated. Firstly, Oxygen-containing functional groups were introduced onto the CNF surface (labeled as CNF-OX) by a simple sonochemical oxidation in mixed acids (concentrated sulfuric acid and nitric acid) and then the nitrogen-containing functional groups were introduced onto the CNF-OX surface (labeled as CNF-ON) by sonochemical treatment in ammonia, and the B-doped CNF was synthesized by mixing CNF-OX and boric acid in a ratio following by pyrolysis at 800 degrees C under N-2 atmosphere (labeled as B-CNF-OX). The XPS results showed that the ultrasonic treatments could introduce oxygen-and nitrogen-containing functional groups onto the CNF surface successfully, the oxygen atoms content of CNF-OX was increased from 1.96% to 6.01% compared to the untreated CNF (CNF-UN), and nitrogen atoms content of CNF-ON was increased from 0% to 1.02% compared to CNF-OX. The pyrolysis of boric acid could introduce B element onto the CNF-OX surface where the B atoms content of B-CNF-OX was 1.00%. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) test results showed that the HER electrocatalytic activity of the modified CNFs were higher than CNF-UN, and among them CNF-ON had the highest electrocatalytic activities for HER than the others, the onset overpotential of CNF-ON was 344 mV, which shifted 240 mV positively compared to CNF-UN, and the electrocatalytic activity of B-CNF-OX was enhanced by B-doping treatment compared to CNF-OX. The Tafel test indicated CNF-ON had smallest Tafel slop of 154 mV/dec and largest exchange current density of 6.68 mu A/cm(2). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out to investigate the complex interfacial properties of the CNFs modified electrode, and the results showed that CNF-ON had the smallest charge transfer resistance of 1578 Omega among all the catalysts, which means the nitrogen-doped CNF had higher activity than the oxygen-and boron-doped CNF. All above indicated that the doping of heteroatom (O, B, N) onto the CNFs surface had effects on their electrocatalytic activity for HER, especially the introduction of N atom onto the CNF surface had excellent improvement.									3	3	0	0	0	0	4			0567-7351			WOS:000360199200010		
J	Sha, Qiqi; Ma, Kongshuo; Li, Jinkai; Zhao, Zhenlu					Zhao, Zhenlu/0000-0002-4148-7973			Pyrolysis-Derived Carbon Auto-Coated Co-Ni Oxide-based Nanoparticles on Graphene-like Nanosheets for High-Performance Oxygen Electrocatalysis								ENERGY & FUELS				35	4			3376	3384		10.1021/acs.energyfuels.0c03980		FEB 2021		FEB 18 2021	2021	Engineering transition-metal-based bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts with high activity and stability has always been a problem. Traditional bare transition-metal-based nanoparticles supported on the outer surface of carbon materials are susceptible to the Ostwald-ripening effect in a catalytic process, consequently suffering from poor long-term operation. However, constructing a highly efficient and stable bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst is still challenging. Here, we report graphene-like carbon nanosheets modified with carbon shell-coated binary Co-Ni oxide-based nanoparticles (CoNiOx@C/G-NSs) by one-step pyrolysis method, in which the hybrids show a three-dimensional fluffy and hierarchical porous nanostructure and large numbers of carbon shell-coated binary Co-Ni oxide-based nanoparticles (CoNiOx@C) dispersed on graphene-like carbon nanosheets evenly. More excitingly, the carbon nanosheets are nitrogen-doped. When applied for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the onset potential (E-onset) of OER reached 1.26 V, and onset potential of ORR and half-wave potential (E-1/2) reached 0.90 and 0.78 V, respectively. The hybrids showed enhanced methanol tolerance, with few changes in the ORR performance with or without adding methanol, and high stability, with 84% activity retention after 10 h continuous reaction. The productivity of H2O2 is about 5% and the number of electron transfer (n) is about 3.9 in the process of catalyzing ORR; density functional theory calculation reveals its high selectivity in the 4e(-) pathway. Its excellent performance is mainly attributed to the synergistic enhancement effect: three-dimensional fluffy and hierarchical porous nanostructure provided a large catalytic activity area, which enabled the effective participation of species and facilitated rapid mass transfer; the rapid adsorption of O-2 by N-doped graphene-like carbon nanosheets ensured fast electron transport; synergistic reactivity between carbon shell and CoNiOx enhanced the activity, and numerous CoNiOx@C nanoparticles reconciled the electron density of the carbon shell, which introduced more active sites; and the carbon shell weakened the Ostwald-ripening effect and ensured the stability of the nanoparticle. All advantages synergistically enhance the catalytic efficiency and make it one of the best bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000621416200039

The employed electrolyte can affect the charge distribution and the electric field on the interface, which also alters the local pH and ordering of the water-solvent network. Additionally, the electrolyte plays a key role in stabilizing or destabilizing the adsorbed intermediates via non-covalent bonds, or poisons the surface and induces surface reconstruction, affecting the reactivity of the active sites positions. Herein, we discuss, from an experimental perspective, electrolyte effects on different interfacial proper-ties relevant to electrocatalysis.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2451-9103			WOS:000787889700007

The presence of a heteroatom in different crystallographic positions in the surface layer of hematite influences the band structure additional donor or acceptor states appear in the band gap depending on the type and charge of the heteroatom. The modifications play a role in altering the absorption coefficient, however to a minor extent in the visible-light range. On the other hand, all investigated substitutions seem advantageous for the oxygen evolution reaction, as for this reaction, the vacuum potential is located inside the band gap. Additionally, the differences in partial charges and binding energy suggest that the substitution site can play a role in preferential binding of the reaction intermediates.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000460996000028

With the creation of BiVO4/CuSCN nanorod heterojunction photoanodes, the photocurrent density increases to 1.78 mA cm(-2) compared to 1.22 mA cm(-2) of bare BiVO4 at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. More importantly, the onset potential for oxygen evolution reaction exhibits a dramatic cathodic shift (similar to 230 mV). The heterojunction also possesses internal quantum efficiency of approximately 50% in the range from 350 to 450 nm with relatively high solar energy conversion efficiency (0.5%) and much higher oxidation efficiency (similar to 90%). The unique electrode architecture design favoring the simple water splitting process over conventionally fabricated electrode by providing more active sites and facilitates transportation and consumption of photoinduced holes could open up a new route for the high-efficiency photoanodes.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			0927-0248	1879-3398		WOS:000437816100056

EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MINERALOGY				29	5			839	850		10.1127/ejm/2017/0029-2656				DEC 2017	2017	Interstitial microstructures of igneous rocks provide vital information on magma evolution. Reaction microstructures including orthopyroxene-magnetite symplectites and olivine-plagioclase coronas have been described from lower-middle units of layered mafic/ultramafic intrusions and were suggested to indicate melt immiscibility. Here we report similar microstructures from the Ji'nan complex in the Shandong Province of the North China Craton, associated with a typical hydrothermal iron ore deposit. The backscattered-electron images and mineral chemical data of the intergrowths of vermicular magnetite within orthopyroxene suggest their formation by reaction between olivine and residual Fe-rich melt under conditions of high oxygen fugacity. The olivineplagioclase coronas are interpreted to have formed through a multi-stage process, in which the inner shell of orthopyroxene formed by the reaction between olivine and residual magmatic liquid above solidus, whereas the outer shell of An-rich plagioclase and vermicular orthopyroxene resulted from subsolidus diffusive reaction between original olivine and plagioclase, triggered by the Na compositional gradient. The intermediate shell of biotite (or amphibole), when present, seems to have been generated by the replacement of orthopyroxene in both the inner and outer shells under hydrous condition. Furthermore, the presence of the symplectites of orthopyroxene and vermicular magnetite indicates Fe-rich magmatic melt with high oxygen fugacity, and the later formation of the intermediate shell of biotite in olivine-plagioclase coronas suggests the incorporation of Cl-, K-bearing magmatic fluid, which provided both the Fe and primary ore-forming fluid for the mineralization. The interstitial microstructures in the Ji'nan complex not only provide insight into the magmatic-hydrothermal evolution, but also indicate the favorable criteria for the iron mineralization.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			0935-1221	1617-4011		WOS:000426885900005

Here, we use nitrogen deficiency carbon nitride as a model catalyst and propose several different reaction mechanisms of PHP based on the comprehensive analysis of experiment and simulation results. Nitrogen vacancies can serve as a center for oxidation, reduction, and charge recombination, promoting the generation of h(+), center dot O-2(-), and O-1(2), respectively, and thus induce H2O2 generation through five different pathways. In particular, the O-1(2) anchored on the catalyst surface can realize the indirect oxidation of isopropanol with the assistance of surrounding water molecules and produce H2O2 with the lowest barrier. This work proves that H2O2 can be generated through multiple pathways and highlights the main roles of O-1(2), which are ignored by previous studies.									22	1	0	0	7	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000697346200011

The results show that oxygen partial pressure affects not only the epitaxial growth but also the morphology evolution of film. It is observed that the texture sharpness of LZO film improves while its surface flatness becomes worse with increasing oxygen partial pressure during the whole heat-treatment process. Further studies illustrate that high oxygen partial pressure at pyrolysis step favors the texture sharpening of LZO film, which is contributed to the complete decomposition of organic constitution and the decrease of residual carbon in oxide film. However, low oxygen partial pressure at crystalline step helps the improvement of surface flatness for LZO thin film. It is supposed to be linked with the decrease of oxygen vacancy defects and the increase of grain size along with the replenishment of oxygen content at the crystallization stage. Tailoring oxygen partial pressure at separate heat-treatment steps is important to improving texture sharpness and surface flatness of LZO buffer film as long as the oxidation of metallic substrate can be avoided in coated conductors.

Here, we show that, in the presence of a seemingly negligible amount of Pt nanoparticles, the ORR can mistakenly be thought to occur via a four-electron pathway on Pt SACs. Various weight percentages (1, 2, 4, 8 wt%) of Pt SACs were prepared on C(3)N(4)layers deposited on a carbon support (C@C3N4). Through a combination of H-2/CO uptakes and high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) results, the amount of Pt nanoparticles could be estimated when they were mixed with Pt single atoms. Particularly, most of Pt in the 4 wt% Pt catalyst existed as single atoms, but a small number of Pt nanoparticles co-existed. Although this catalyst seemed to follow the four-electron pathway, the reaction actually occurred on Pt nanoparticles, not Pt single-atoms.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2196-0216			WOS:000561817600001

In the past few decades, many kinds of catalysts have been produced with promising catalytic performance for oxidation reactions; however, the understanding of the mechanisms is still insufficient due to the complexity of the composition and structure of conventional catalysts. In the past several years, the community has tried to address this problem by using ligand-protected atomically precise gold nanoclusters as model catalysts. Ligand-protected gold nanoclusters possess well-defined molecular formulas and structures, and they could serve as ideal model catalysts to understand the correlations between the composition/structure and the catalytic properties at the atomic level. This feature article provides a systematic overview of the related oxidation reactions and the understanding of the mechanisms based on atomically precise gold nanoclusters.									33	0	0	0	7	0	33			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000510662900001	31898703	
J	Zaman, Neelam; Iqbal, Naseem; Noor, Tayyaba								Advances and challenges of MOF derived carbon-based electrocatalysts and photocatalyst for water splitting: A review								ARABIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY				15	7					103906	10.1016/j.arabjc.2022.103906				JUL 2022	2022	Environmental pollution and energy shortage are substantial fears to the modern world's long-term sustainability. Water splitting is an essential technique for eco - friendly and sustainable energy storage, as well as a pollution-free method to produce hydrogen. In this regards Metal-organic frameworks have emerged as the most competent multifunctional materials in recent times, due to its large surface areas, adjustable permeability, easy compositional alteration, and capability for usage as precursors with a wide range of morphological forms. Further, MOF-derived carbonbased nanomaterials also offer significant benefits in terms of tunable morphological features and hierarchical permeability, as well as ease of functionalization, making them extremely effective as catalysts or catalysts supports for a wide variety of important reactions. Recent developments in carbon-based MOFs as catalysts for overall water splitting are discussed in this review. We explore how MOFs and carbon-based MOFs might well be beneficial, as well as which methods should be explored for future development. We divided our review into two sections: photocatalytic and electrocatalytic water splitting, and we gathered published literature on carbon-based MOFs materials for their outstanding activity, offers helpful methods for catalysts design and analysis, as well as difficulties This study highlights the developments in MOF derived materials as photo and electro catalysts by explaining respective approaches for their use in overall water splitting.(c) 2022 The Authors.

It has been found that 02 evolution and the multiline EPR signal were inhibited at acidic (pK similar to 5.3) and alkaline (pK similar to 8.1) pH values, and were maximal at pH 6.0-7.0. Our results indicate that the loss of O-2 evolution and the S-2-state multiline EPR signal associated with the decrease of the millisecond delayed chlorophyll fluorescence only in alkaline region (pH 7.0-8.5). Possible correlations of the millisecond delayed chlorophyll fluorescence components with the donor side reactions in PSII are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, the practical PEC solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency is still low owing to poor light absorption and rapid recombination of charge carriers in photoelectrode. In this work, we report a ternary photoanode with simultaneously enhancement of light absorption and water oxidation efficiency by introducing copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) and nickel iron-layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) on TiO2 (denoted as TiO2/CuPc/NiFe-LDH). An experimental study reveals that CuPc loading on TiO2 bring strong visible light absorption; NiFe-LDH as an oxygen evolution reaction catalyst efficiently accelerates the surface water oxidation reaction. This synergistic effect of CuPc and NiFe-LDH gives enhanced photocurrent density (2.10 mA/cm(2) at 0.6 V vs. SCE) and excellent stability in the ternary TiO2/CuPc/NiFeLDH photoanode.

In order to investigate the modification effect of B4C, the residue values of pure PF resin and B4C modified PF resin were measured using thermal gravity. It was shown that the residue values of B4C modified PF resin are 71.9% and 68.4% after being pyrolyzed at 700 and 1000 degrees C, respectively, which are obviously higher than those of the pure PF resin (62.9% and 60.5% at 700 and 1000 degrees C, respectively). The microstructure evolution of the modified resin at high temperatures was also investigated by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive analysis of X-rays. By means of the microstructure characterization, the modification reactions between the B4C additives and the oxygen-containing volatiles, such as CO and H2O, are demonstrated. The carbon and oxygen elements remained in the resin matrix in the forms of amorphous carbon and B2O3, respectively, resulting in the improvement of residue values and stability of the PF resin at high temperatures. The distribution of modification particles became well-proportioned gradually at the elevated temperatures, and the shape of ceramic additives changed into white spherules due to the surface tension.

Herein, a photocatalysis-self-Fenton system was constructed on garland g-C3N4 with carbon defects (GCN-PSFs) for pollutants degradation. Carbon defects in the obtained GCN not only accelerate charge separation but also improve 2e(-) ORR. As expected, the apparent rate constant for 2,4-DCP degradation by GCN-PSFs enhances to 0.070 min(-1), which is 5.4, 3.3 and 2.6 times as that of BCN, BCN-PSFs and GCN. The capture experiments and electron spin resonance indicate that the high activity is attributed to abundant center dot OH radicals, which are formed from the in-situ produced H2O2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation confirms that the carbon defects in GCN is favorable for photocatalytic 2e(-) ORR to H2O2. This work provides a new insight for high-efficient degradation of organic pollutants by PSFs.									31	2	0	0	5	0	33			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000790409300002

The synthesis parameters including reaction time and temperature were first optimized to produce CuS with a well-controlled and unique morphology, providing the best electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In an extension to this approach, the electrocatalytic activity was further improved by incorporating Co into the CuS synthesis method to yield CuCo2S4 microflowers. Both routes provide high microflower yields of >80 wt %. The CuCo2S4 microflowers exhibit a superior performance for the OER in alkaline medium compared to CuS. This is demonstrated by a lower onset potential (similar to 1.45 V vs RHE @10 mA/cm(2)), better durability, and higher turnover frequencies compared to bare CuS flowers or commercial Pt/C and IrO2 electrodes. Likely, this effect is associated with the presence of Co3+ sites on which a better adsorption of reactive species formed during the OER (e.g., OH, O, OOH, etc.) can be achieved, thus reducing the OER charge-transfer resistance, as indicated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000595547400028	33180455

X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy are used to characterize the synthesized products. The effects of gamma-CoOOH on the electrochemical performance of nickel electrodes are investigated using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and a charge/discharge test. It is found that the spherical gamma-CoOOH-coated Ni(OH)(2) electrode without adding any conductive additives exhibits superior electrode properties including excellent high-temperature and high-rate discharge abilities, and superior cycling reversibility. These performance improvements are ascribed to the enhancement of oxygen evolution over-potential, slower oxygen evolution rate and lower charge transfer resistance resulting from the high conductivity coating of gamma-CoOOH.

For energy conversion, herein, we developed copper cobalt sulfide on carbon cloth (CC) using a simple and facile hydrothermal method. A vertically grown 2D sheet-like structure of copper-cobalt sulfide is observed using L-cysteine as a sulfur source. An optimized ratio of copper(II) and cobalt(III) and the best sulfur source are found to boost the electrocatalytic activity of mixed metal thiospinel for OER. Several characterization techniques (XRD, Raman, FESEM, TEM, XPS, and ICP-AES) were used to confirm phase purity, morphology, and composition of copper cobalt sulfides. We have established that 2D nanosheets of CuCo3Sz/CC exhibited superior electrocatalytic performance over bare RuO2 in 1.0 M KOH solution. It is observed that CuCo3Sz/CC need only 105 mV overpotential to generate 5 mA/cm(2) current density. CuCo3Sz/CC is very stable and able to produce unaltered current density under an applied potential of 1.615 V vs. RHE for 48 h. Electrochemically active surface area calculation is performed for all catalysts to confirm higher electrocatalytic activity. The catalyst, CuCo3Sz/CC is used in a broad pH region using 0.5 M KOH, saline water, and 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution to widen the applicability of water splitting. This work shows an avenue to develop active and durable electrocatalyst for OER without using any noble metal electrocatalyst.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2196-0216			WOS:000501380700015

The numerical values for individual phase contents and non-superconducting second phase (NSP) size distributions generated in this way were used to quantify the temporal evolution of composition in the variably treated Ag/Bi-2223 tapes. Results for the three pO(2)/T set points investigated (2 1.0% O-2/835 degreesC, 7.5 % O-2/825 degreesC and 4.0% O-2/815 degreesC) revealed characteristic patterns of recurring maxima and minima in the time evolution of the NSPs. (Ca, Sr)(14)Cu24O41 was found to be the stable phase at 2 1.0% O-2/835 degreesC, possibly evolving as a co-product of the Bi-2223 formation reaction, while (Ca, Sr)(2)CuO3 and CuO were stable at 4.0% O-2/815 degreesC, presumably as a consequence of competitive secondary reactions proceeding in parallel with Bi-2223 formation. The best-aligned grains were formed in Ag/Bi-2223 tapes treated at 2 1.0% O-2/835 degreesC, while the best conversion to Bi-2223, together with the least amount of NSP particles >0.5 mum in major dimension, was produced by the 7.5% O-2/825 degreesC treatment. A forward-looking conclusion of the study is that it appears possible to minimize the amount and size of NSP particles during Ag/Bi-2223 heat treatment by using a combinatorial sequence of appropriately timed pO(2)/T set points.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0953-2048			WOS:000177295300032

Here, we report on a laboratory study of the formation of water via the O+D reaction network. While prior studies were done on ices, as appropriate to the formation of water in dense clouds, we explored how water formation occurs on bare surfaces, i.e., in conditions mimicking the transition from diffuse to dense clouds (Av similar to 1-5). Reaction products were detected during deposition and afterward when the sample is brought to a high temperature. We quantified the formation of water and intermediary products, such as D2O2, over a range of surface temperatures (15-25 K). The detection of OD on the surface signals the importance of this reactant in the overall scheme of water formation in the ISM.									41	0	0	0	2	0	41			2041-8205	2041-8213		WOS:000296753000009

Monometallic Fe catalysts show limited performance mostly due to poor conductivity and stability. Here, by taking advantage of the structurally ordered and highly conducting FeSn(2)nanostructure, for the first time, an intermetallic iron material is employed as an efficient anode for the alkaline OER, overall water-splitting, and also for selective oxygenation of organic substrates. The electrophoretically deposited FeSn(2)on nickel foam (NF) and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes displays remarkable OER activity and durability with substantially low overpotentials of 197 and 273 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, which outperform most of the benchmarking NiFe-based catalysts. The resulting superior activity is attributed to the in situ generation of alpha-FeO(OH)@FeSn(2)where alpha-FeO(OH) acts as the active site while FeSn(2)remains the conductive core. When the FeSn(2)anode is coupled with a Pt cathode for overall alkaline water-splitting, a reduced cell potential (1.53 V) is attained outperforming that of noble metal-based catalysts. FeSn(2)is further applied as an anode to produce value-added products through selective oxygenation reactions of organic substrates.									47	0	0	0	3	0	47			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000542183000001

Currently, various noble/transition metal-based materials have been developed as catalysts for boosting their catalytic performances. Among them, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have received increasing interest as promising electrocatalysts owing to their maximum utilization of active species, low-coordination environment, quantum size effect and tunable metal-support interaction. Over the past few years, tremendous SACs have been fabricated by using various approaches and are further used for the advanced energy conversion process. In this review, we offer a critical overview on the state-of-the-art design of SACs under the framework of bottom-up and top-down strategies and in-situ/operando characterizations. We also comprehensively present recent advances in the development of SACs for ORR electrocatalysis, fuel cells and zinc-air batteries, and describe key challenges and future opportunities in this emerging field.									43	5	0	0	5	0	44			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000600993400003

When maintained at 30-degrees-C the fly CL intensity was stronger than at 25-degrees-C. Under the condition of the higher temperature, the fly life span was shorter (mean life span = 29 days at 30-degrees-C and 63 days at 25-degrees-C), and oxygen consumption (3.7-mu-l/mg.h at 25-degrees-C, 4.9-mu-l/mg.h at 30-degrees-C) and the mobility (movement distance = 25 mm/min at 25-degrees-C, 700 mm/min at 30-degrees-C) increased, together with augmentation of phospholipid hydroperoxide in the fly total lipids. The CL spontaneously emitted from fly homogenate was decreased by the free radical scavengers both in experiments in vivo and in vitro. The hypothesis is proposed that as the oxygen metabolism grows active, the chemiluminescent reactions that involve oxygen-dependent free radical metabolism, including membrane phospholipid hydroperoxidation, contribute to the acceleration of senescence of fly bodies.									9	0	0	0	7	0	9			0304-324X			WOS:A1992HV96600007	1612461

Although noble metals have been extensively used as electrocatalysts, their limited natural abundance and high costs have motivated the search for more cost-effective catalysts. Oxides are suitable candidates since they are relatively inexpensive and have shown reasonably high activity for various electrochemical reactions. However, a lack of fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanisms has been a major hurdle toward improving electrocatalytic activity. Detailed studies of the oxide surface atomic structure and chemistry (e.g., cation migration) can provide much needed insights for the design of highly efficient and stable oxide electrocatalysts.In this Account, we focus on recent advances in characterizing strontium (Sr) cation segregation and enrichment near the surface of Sr-substituted perovskite oxides under different operating conditions (e.g., high temperature, applied potential), as well as their influence on the surface oxygen exchange kinetics at elevated temperatures. We contrast Sr segregation, which is associated with Sr redistribution in the crystal lattice near the surface, with Sr enrichment, which involves Sr redistribution via the formation of secondary phases. The newly developed coherent Bragg rod analysis (COBRA) and energy-modulated differential COBRA are uniquely powerful ways of providing information about surface and interfacial cation segregation at the atomic scale for these thin film electrocatalysts. In situ ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) studies under electrochemical operating conditions give additional insights into cation migration. Direct COBRA and APXPS evidence for surface Sr segregation was found for La1-xSrxCoO3-delta and (La1-ySry)(2)CoO4 +/-delta/La1-xSrxCoO3-delta oxide thin films, and the physical origin of segregation is discussed in comparison with (La1-ySry)(2)CoO4 +/-delta/La1-xSrxCo0.2Fe0.8O3-delta. Sr enrichment in many electrocatalysts, such as La1-xSrxMO3-delta (M = Cr, Co, Mn, or Co and Fe) and Sm1-xSrxCoO3-delta, has been probed using alternative techniques, including low energy ion scattering, secondary ion mass spectrometry, and X-ray fluorescence-based methods for depth dependent, element-specific analysis. We highlight a strong connection between cation segregation and electrocatalytic properties, because cation segregation enhances oxygen transport and surface oxygen exchange kinetics. On the other hand, the formation of cation-enriched secondary phases can lead to the blocking of active sites, inhibiting oxygen exchange. With help from density functional theory, the links between cation migration, catalyst stability, and catalytic activity are provided, and the oxygen p-band center relative to the Fermi level can be identified as an activity descriptor. Based on these findings, we discuss strategies to increase a catalyst's activity while maintaining stability to design efficient, cost-effective electrocatalysts.									63	1	0	0	5	0	63			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000376331400021	27149528

In this regard, the vacancy defects have been proven to be effective to initiate catalytic active sites and endow high electrocatalytic activities. However, such electrocatalytically active defects reported to date have been mostly formed by anion vacancies. Herein, it is demonstrated for the first time that iron cation vacancies induce superb water splitting bifunctionality in alkaline media. A simple wet-chemistry method is developed to grow ultrathin feroxyhyte (delta-FeOOH) nanosheets with rich Fe vacancies on Ni foam substrate. The theoretical and experimental results confirm that, in contrast to anion vacancies, the formation of rich second neighboring Fe to Fe vacancies in delta-FeOOH nanosheets can create catalytic active centers for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. The atomic level insight into the new catalyst activation principle based on metal vacancies is adaptable for developing other transition metal electrocatalysts, including Fe-based ones.									194	11	0	0	16	0	195			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000443377100023	30019788

However, the performance of AEMWE is limited by the slow reaction kinetics of the catalyst and poor mass transport of gases and electrolyte at high current densities. Herein, we report Fe0.2Ni0.8-P0.5S0.5 nanoisland arrays as an efficient bifunctional catalyst with ultralow overpotentials of 85 mV (for HER) and 180 mV (for OER) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory calculations reveal that bimetallic doping of Fe0.2Ni0.8-P0.5S0.5 effectively improve the intrinsic activity. Particularly, the Fe0.2Ni0.8-P0.5S0.5 electrode is endowed with superhydrophilicity and aerophobicity, which not only facilitates to the exposure of active sites, but also markedly enhance gas and electrolye diffusion at high current density. Therefore, the AEMWE based on the Fe0.2Ni0.8-P0.5S0.5 bifunctional electrodes delivers a current density of 2.5 A cm(-2) at 2.0 V. Moreover, the AEMWE maintained long-term operation without obvious performance degradation for 300 h.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000777020200002		
J	Zhu, Zhixiang; Zhang, Zhongxiao; Yu, Juan; Wu, Xiaojiang; Li, Zixiang; Bi, Degui; Su, Sheng								Length Experimental and kinetic studies of NO reduction by ammonia injection into high-temperature reducing atmosphere								FUEL				329						125393	10.1016/j.fuel.2022.125393				DEC 1 2022	2022	Experiments were conducted to investigate the NO(x )reduction performance by ammonia injection into a high -temperature reducing atmosphere and the integrated effects of temperature and oxygen concentration were discussed in detail. Ammonia oxidation was trivial at lower temperatures and the presence of oxygen facilitated the replenishment of OH radicals, enhancing the NOx reduction efficiency. The replenishment of OH radicals and ammonia oxidation were simultaneously promoted at higher temperatures. Therefore, trace amount of oxygen was preferred for higher temperatures to suppress the NOx formation from ammonia oxidation. A maximum NOx reduction efficiency of over 95 % was achieved at 1573 K and 0.0 vol% O-2 with normalized stoichiometric ratio of 1.5 and residence time of 0.71 s. Furthermore, rate-of-production analysis was performed to provide insights into NH3/NO reaction pathways in the absence of oxygen. Results showed that the NOx reduction process was initiated by thermal decomposition of NH3 and CO2 acted the role of O(2 )when oxygen is absent, which could provide O atoms to react with H for the replenishment of OH radicals. The relatively high activation energy of NH3 decomposition accounted for the shift of the temperature window towards higher temperatures in the absence of oxygen.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000861333100002

The fabrication mechanism of OCNA was discussed. OCNA exhibited much faster charge separation efficiency, longer carriers' lifetime than bulk carbon nitride (BCN). More importantly, oxygen-doping led to a more negative conduction band (CB) position and narrower band gap (E-g). Hence, the spectral response range of OCNA was extended dramatically and the hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of OCNA (lambda > 510 nm) was about 26 times as high as that of BCN prepared herein. OCNA exhibited a remarkable apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 20.42% at 380 nm, 7.43% at 420 nm and 1.71% at 500 nm, superior to most of the reported C3N4-based materials. This work paves a facile colloid chemistry strategy to assemble self-supported 3D CNA that could be widely adopted in the sustainability field.									77	2	0	0	14	0	78			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000437965900044

In comparison with Pt/C, the results exhibit that PtCeO2@CN possesses a preferable methanol tolerance ability, superior stability (30000 s degradation: 35% for PtCeO2@CN vs. 50% for Pt/C), and more positively the onset potential (16 mV) as well as half-wave potential (29 mV) towards oxygen reduction reaction. Further, the investigation shows that PtCeO2@CN has a certain selectivity with quasi-four electron pathway (n = 3.2-3.3 e(-)). This is attributed to the establishment of "nitrogen-doped carbon layer" structure, which heightens the conductivity of CeO2, further promotes electron transfer between Pt and CeO2, as well as strengthens the anchoring effect for Pt nanoparticles. Overall, this study would shed bright light to develop some effective Pt-oxide based composite electrocatalysts. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The results suggested that the Cr6+ species were indispensable for activating the dehydrogenation reaction thanks to the oxidation-reduction cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+. The type of the promotor also affected significantly the ability of replenishing the lattice oxygen through the disassociation of CO2, leading to the different catalytic performances.

These circuits can develop into general equivalent circuits by introducing negative resistive and inductive and capacitive elements, each of which can be used to analyze any electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of the faradaic electrode process under electrochemical reaction control. The correspondence between element values of the circuits and electrochemical parameters of the faradaic admittance equation has also been determined by comparing the admittance or impedance of the equivalent circuit and the faradaic admittance or impedance equation. The use of general equivalent circuits; together with the faradaic admittance equation, greatly simplifies the analysis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for the faradaic electrode processes.

Their bifunctional electrocatalytic-supercapacitive properties were obtained simultaneously due to synergistic effects between macroscopic morphological features and microscopic atomic/electronic structure of Co0.85Se. The as-synthesized hollow spheres of Co0.85Se that are constructed by 2D mesoporous ultrathin nanosheets exhibit inspiring electrochemical performance for supercapacitor, presenting maximum energy density at high power density (54.66 Wh center dot kg(-1) at 1.6 kW center dot kg(-1)) and long cycle stability (88% retention after 8,000 cycles). At the same time, the hollow spheres of Co0.85Se constructed by 2D mesoporous ultrathin nanosheets display excellent catalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to special structure, high surface area and mesoporous nature of sheets, which achieve low overpotential (290 mV at 10 mA center dot g(-1)) and low Tafel slope (81 mV center dot dec(-1)) for long-term operation (only 7.8% decay in current density after 9 h). It could be envisioned that the proposed simple approach will pave a new way to synthesize other metal chalcogenides for energy conversion and storage technology.									19	3	0	0	0	0	19			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000492651700001

Mixed hydrogen is converted into neutron through C-12(p,gamma)N-13(e+v)C-13(alpha,n)O-16 and the doubly neutron-recycling reactions C-12(n,gamma)C-13(alpha,n)O-16(n,gamma)O-17(alpha,n)Ne-20 operate. In addition to oxygen and neon, not only light elements from sodium through phosphorus but also the s-process elements, heavier than iron, are synthesized via successive neutron captures with Ne-20 as seeds even in the stars originally devoid of metals. We follow the both the doubly neutron-recycling reactions and the s-process nucleosynthesis up to Ph and Bi by varying model parameters such as the amount of mixed C-13. The resultant abundance patterns is shown to reproduce the observed enhancement not only of oxygen, the light elements but also Sr observed from HE 0107-5240 and HE 1327-2326.

The 5 V capacity increases with increasing amount of excess lithium y. In contrast to a recent literature report, the data demonstrate that excess oxygen is not needed to impart the 5 V capacity. With the samples having a significant amount of excess lithium y>0.1, the 4 V capacity increases with cycling while the 5 V capacity decreases. The 5 V capacities of the LiMn2-yLiyO4+or-delta spinels are explained on the basis of an electrochemical oxidation of Mn4+ or O2-, which subsequently results in a self-discharge reaction involving the evolution of oxygen from the lattice and a reduction of Mn4+ to Mn3+.									0	0	0		0	0	0			1099-0062			INSPEC:7772434

Herein, we report a vulcanization-assisted pyrolysis strategy for creating zeolitic imidazolate frameworkderived catalysts with a N, S co-doped carbon support and highly exposed ZnS and Zn-Nx sites. The trithiocyanuric acid (TCA) is found not only to introduce S into the carbon derived from ZIF-8 and ZnS to adjust the electronic structure of carbon matrix during the pyrolysis, but also result in a shrinkage of carbon framework with a hierarchical porous structure. Such an architecture boosts abundant active sites exposed and accelerates remote mass transportation. As a result, the optimized 3.5ZnS/NSC-NaCl-900 delivers an impressive enhanced performance toward ORR in alkaline medium with a high half-wave potential of 0.905 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode), which is superior to most of non-precious metal-based catalysts. Density functional theory calculations unveil that the ZnS in 3.5ZnS/NSC-NaCl-900 can effectively lower the Gibbs energy barrier of crucial steps and therefore promotes the reaction kinetics. Furthermore, 3.5ZnS/NSC-NaCl-900 also displays greater power density and specific capacity than Pt/C in Al-air batteries. CO 2021 Elsevier Inc.

We found that a two-step annealing strategy could further increase the photoelectrochemical (PEC) efficiency of CFO photocathodes. It was elucidated that two-step annealing was beneficial in various aspects such as morphology, chemical state, optical properties, and impedance. In addition, the NiO HTL further improved the charge transport properties. The CFO on NiO HTL fabricated via two-step annealing demonstrates a photocurrent density of up to-313.7 mu A/cm(2), which is 76 % higher than that of the HTL-free CFO fabricated via single-step annealing. Through DFT calculations, it is revealed that the increase in the concentration of oxygen vacancies at the CFO surface, which was obtained by the two-step annealing process, is beneficial for lowering the relative energy throughout the hydrogen evolution reaction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000780378500002

It is a system combining photoconversion and energy storage since converted solar energy is stored as high energy-density hydrogen gas. According to intrinsic properties and band bending situation of a photoelectrode, hydrogen tends to be released at photocathode while oxygen at photoanode. In a tandem photoelectrochemical chemical cell, current passing through one electrode must equals that through another and electrode with lower conversion rate will limit efficiency of the whole device. Therefore, it is also of research interest to look into the common strategies for enhancing the conversion rate at photoanode. Although up to 15% of solar-to-hydrogen efficiency can be estimated according to some semiconductor for solar assisted water splitting, practical conversion ability of state-of-the-art photoanode has yet to approach that theoretical limit. Five major steps happen in a full water splitting reaction at a semiconductor surface: light harvesting with electron excitations, separated electron-hole pairs transferring to two opposite ends due to band bending, electron/hole injection through semiconductor-electrolyte interface into water, recombination process and mass transfer of products/reactants. They are closely related to different proposed parameters for solar water splitting evaluation and this review will first help to give a fast glance at those evaluation parameters and then summarize on several major adopted strategies towards high-efficiency oxygen evolution at photoanode surface. Those strategies and thereby optimized evaluation parameter are shown, in order to disclose the importance of modifying different steps for a photoanode with enhanced output.									14	2	0	0	0	0	14			1000-6818			WOS:000392556700006

We report the synthesis and OER electrocatalysis of both Ni-Cu nanoparticles (20-50 nm in diameter) and Ni-Cu nanoclusters (<20 metal atoms). Analysis of mass spectral data from matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and electrospray ionization techniques demonstrates that discrete heterobimetallic Ni-Cu nanoclusters capped with glutathione ligands were successfully synthesized. Ni-Cu nanoclusters with a 52 : 48 mol% Ni : Cu metal composition display an OER onset overpotential of 50 mV and an overpotential of 150 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which makes this catalyst one of the most efficient nonprecious metal OER catalysts. The durability of the nanocluster catalysts on carbon electrodes can be extended by appending them to electrodes modified with TiO(2)nanoparticles. Infrared spectroscopy results indicate that the aggregation dynamics of the glutathione ligands change during catalysis. Taken together, these results help explain the reactivity of a novel class of nanostructured Ni-Cu OER catalysts, which are underexplored alternatives to more commonly studied Ni-Fe, Ni-Co, and Ni-Mn materials.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000556422000003	33796262

Although NiFe (oxy)hydroxide has been widely studied as a water oxidation catalyst due to its high catalytic capability and abundance, its structural manipulation has been greatly restricted due to its inherent crystallographic stacking feature. In this work, we report for the first time the construction of a nanotube structure of NiFe (oxy)hydroxide with an inner Ni-rich layer, which was radially aligned on a macroporous nickel foam. Such a hierarchically structured material realized several crucial factors that are essential for excellent catalytic behaviors, including abundant catalytic sites, a high surface area, efficient ionic and electronic transport, etc., and the designed catalyst exhibited competitive electrocatalytic activity for reaction of not only oxygen evolution but also hydrogen evolution, which is very rare. As a result, this novel material was well-suited for the use as a bifunctional catalyst in an integrated water-splitting electrolyzer, which could be even driven by a single AA battery or a 1.5 V solar cell, outperforming a benchmark catalyst of noble-metal ruthenium platinum combinations and most state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. The work provided important suggestions for the rational modulation of catalysts with new structures targeted for high-performance electrodes used in electrochemical applications.									54	2	0	0	1	0	54			1944-8244			WOS:000427910800022	29446915

The present study comprehensively evaluates the chloride oxidation on Ti/RuO2-IrO2 in solutions containing different NaCl concentrations and pH values. Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectroscopy (DEMS) is used to account for the in-situ surface reactions simultaneously occurring during chloride and water oxidations. It is found that HOCl does not lead the chlorine mechanism since OCl center dot is detected in considerably larger amounts under some experimental conditions, and its onset overpotential is similar to 150 mVmore negative than HOCl appearance at 0.2 mol L-1 NaCl. Additionally, themass signals of OCl center dot and HOCl are virtually similar at pH = 2 and slightly different at pH = 10, where these species should not respectively exist according to thermodynamic information. Under this premise, an extension of the reaction mechanism is proposed to consider an independent pathway producing adsorbed hypochlorite radical (OClads center dot) for electro-generated active chlorine, which could be the preferential one since RuO2 and IrO2 belong to the category of "active" anodes towards the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), thus allowing the formation of the so-called higher oxide MOx(O-center dot)(ads) (chemisorbed oxygen). Although the mechanisms involving the productions of HOClads and OClads center dot can simultaneously occur on two type of non-identified active sites, promoting the generation of both MOx((OH)-O-center dot)(ads) and MOx(O-center dot)(ads) species, both strongly depend on surface pH.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000593969400019

In order to guide catalyst performance improvement, knowledge of the detailed mechanism of the four-electron oxidation of water to oxygen at the elementary step level is required. This has proved especially challenging for robust, Earth abundant metal oxide catalysts. Electrokinetic methods and ex situ or in situ steady state spectroscopy have revealed some insights into rate limiting steps or structural phase transformations of the catalyst under applied potential. Recent observation of surface reaction intermediates with rapid-scan FT-IR spectroscopy under reaction conditions with temporal resolution of milliseconds has allowed to establish the molecular structure and kinetic relevancy of transient species, and to identify their role in the catalytic cycle.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			2211-3398			WOS:000388513000013

Besides, the absence of noble metals and high electrocatalytic activity of TMPs allow their applicability as catalysts in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, CoNiP-CoP2 (CNP-CP) composite is in situ deposited on carbon fabric by a one-step hydrothermal technique. The CNP-CP reveals hybrid nanoarchitecture (3D-on-1D HNA), i.e., cashew fruit-like nanostructures and nanocones. The CNP-CP HNA electrode delivers higher areal capacity (82.8 mu Ah cm(-2)) than the other electrodes. Furthermore, a hybrid cell assembled with CNP-CP HNA shows maximum energy and power densities of 31 mu Wh cm(-2) and 10.9 mW cm(-2), respectively. Exclusively, the hybrid cell demonstrates remarkable durability over 30 000 cycles. In situ/operando X-ray absorption near-edge structure analysis confirms the reversible changes in valency of Co and Ni elements in CNP-CP material during real-time electrochemical reactions. Besides, a quasi-solid-state device unveils its practicability by powering electronic components. Meanwhile, the CNP-CP HNA verifies its higher OER activity than the other catalysts by revealing lower overpotential (230 mV). Also, it exhibits relatively small Tafel slope (38 mV dec(-1)) and stable OER activity over 24 h. This preparation strategy may initiate the design of advanced TMP-based materials for multifunctional applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2198-3844		WOS:000745462600001	35064771

Cu(0.4)In(0.6)NNi(3)shows the highest intrinsic performance among all developed catalysts with an overpotential of merely 42 mV at 10 mA cm(geo)(-2). Stability tests at a high current density of 100 mA cm(geo)(-2)show its super-stable performance with only 7 mV increase in overpotential after more than 60 hours of measurement, surpassing commercial Pt/C (increase of 170 mV). By partial substitution, the derived antiperovskite nitride achieves a smaller kinetic barrier of water dissociation compared to the unsubstituted InNNi(3)and CuNNi3, revealed by first-principle calculations. It is found that the partially substituted Cu(x)In(1-x)NNi(3)possesses a thermal neutral and desirable Gibbs free energy of hydrogen for HER, ascribed to the tailoring of the energy of d-band center arose by the A-site (A=Cu or In) substitution and a resulting optimization of adsorbate interactions.									20	4	0	0	0	0	22			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000557995300001	32578368

Like the active sites of hydrogenases, the cation sites of pyrite-type transition-metal dichalcogenides have been suggested to be active in the HER. Herein, we synthesized electrodes based on a Se-enriched NiSe2 nanosheet array and explored the relationship between the anion sites and the improved hydrogen evolution activity through theoretical and experimental studies. The free energy for atomic hydrogen adsorption is much lower on the Se sites (0.13 eV) than on the Ni sites (0.87 eV). Notably, this electrode benefits from remarkable kinetic properties, with a small overpotential of 117 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 32 mV per decade, and excellent stability. Control experiments showed that the efficient conversion of H+ into H-2 is due to the presence of an excess of selenium in the NiSe2 nanosheet surface.									253	14	0	0	6	0	256			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000377921400021	27110850

Herein, for the first time, then-octylammonium hypophosphite, a kind of protic ionic liquid (IL), was used as a new phosphorus source for the manufacture of nickel metaphosphate (Ni2P4O12) electrocatalysts. In contrast to traditional multi-step fabrication processes, then-octylammonium hypophosphite acted as both reactant and solvent to synthesize Ni(2)P(4)O(12)by a one-step calcination approach. The obtained Ni(2)P(4)O(12)as an alkaline HER catalyst required a low overpotential of 116 mV at -10 mA cm(-2)and a small Tafel slope of 97 mV dec(-1), comparable to the majority of reported Ni-based materials and other phosphate catalysts. Furthermore, this catalyst exhibited robust stability with no distinct attenuation of current density after a long-term durability test in 1 M KOH. Therefore, this task-specific IL strategy with a simple reaction system, reducing the occurrence of side reactions, provided a new perspective on design of high-efficiency metaphosphate electrocatalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000576488900001	33006323

Here, self-supported porous crystalline Zn-Ni-Co/Cu selenides microballs arrays were constructed by selenation of the designed tubular Cu(OH)(2) arrays decorated with ultrathin Zn-Co-Ni tri-metallic hydroxide on carbon cloth substrate. For this rational engineering, a novel precursor sample was firstly prepared by conversion of deposited Cu layer to hollow tubular Cu(OH)(2) arrays on carbon cloth, then, Zn-Co-Ni layered ternary hydroxides with a thin layer structure was deposited around this tubular arrays. The selenation with an exciting morphology change from amorphous tube to highly crystalline microballs lead to the advanced electrode materials that successfully combine the desired merits such as high conductivity, large specific surface areas, and multiple redox and electrocatalytic active sites for asymmetric supercapacitors, oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) applications. Interestingly, the Zn-Ni-Co/Cu microballs selenide does not demonstrate striking capacitive behaviors, when evaluated as a battery-type material for electrochemical energy storage (ESs) with the maximum capacity reaching as high as 884.6 C g(-1) (or 2211.5 F g(-1)) at 1 A g(-1) and excellent rate capability. But it exhibits competitive OER and UOR electrocatalytic performances with excellent stability, which requires a low potential of 0.312 V (vs. AgCl) to drive 100 mA cm(-2) in UOR and remarkable catalytic current of 325 mA cm(-2) at 1.6 V vs. RHE for OER in alkaline solutions, which superior than that of the reported metal selenides or oxides materials up to date.									84	2	0	0	5	0	85			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000483341000157

Sandwich-structured Fe3O4/Au/CoFe-LDH is synthesized via a spontaneous galvanic displacement reaction. A series of structural characterizations indicate the successful synthesis of sandwich-structured Fe3O4/Au/CoFe-LDH electrocatalyst. The trace amount of Au laying between Fe3O4 and CoFe-LDH significantly improves the intrinsic conductivity and catalytic activity of the composite catalyst. In-depth investigations indicate that Fe3O4 and CoFe-LDH are responsible for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) whereas Au is responsible for the electrocatalytic glucose oxidation (GOR). The electrocatalytic tests indicate Fe3O4/Au/CoFe-LDH offers excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability for both HER and GOR, even at high current density (i.e., 1000 mA cm(-2)). Further electrochemistry examinations in a two-compartment cell with a two-electrode configuration show that Fe3O4/Au/CoFe-LDH can significantly reduce the overall potential for this asymmetrical cell, with only 0.48 and 0.89 V required to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) current density with and without iR-compensation, which is the lowest overall potential requirement ever reported. The design and synthesis of Fe3O4/Au/CoFe-LDH pave a new way to electrochemically produce hydrogen and gluconate under extremely low cell voltage, which can readily match with a variety of solar cells.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000707498900001	34655158

However, the controversial understanding for the improvement origin remains a key challenge to unlock the PEC performance. Herein, by taking BiVO4/iron-nickel hydroxide (BVO/FxN4-x-H) as a prototype, we decoupled the PEC process into two processes including charge transfer and surface catalytic reaction. The kinetic information at the BVO/FxN4-x-H and FxN4-x-H/electrolyte interfaces was systematically evaluated by employing scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy (SPECM), intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) model. It was found that FxN4-x-H acts as a charge transporter rather than a sole electrocatalyst. PEC performance improvement is mainly ascribed to the efficient suppression of charge recombination by fast hole transfer kinetics at BVO/FxN4-x-H interface.									21	0	0	0	2	0	21			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000598642800001	33105064

The main reason is ascribed to the sluggish kinetics of the first and last proton-coupled electron transfer (ET) on the unitary single-atom site. In this work, an asymmetrical dual-metal dimer catalytic center, which is inspired by the active sites of natural enzymes, such as nitrogenases, that efficiently catalyze the reduction of N-2 to NH3 through FeMo cofactors, is theoretically reported. Remarkably, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the random combination of two non-precious metal atoms such as Fe, Co, Mo, W and Ru to form catalytically active bimetallic sites lead to a remarkable reduction of about two times of the first or last hydrogenation free energy barrier step. The resulting Mo-Ru, Mo-Co, Mo-W, Mo-Fe and Fe-Ru dimers exhibited ultra-low onset potentials of only 0.17, 0.27, 0.28, 0.36 and 0.39 V, respectively. Meanwhile, the HER side reaction can be well suppressed during the NRR. The superior catalytic performance in the bimetallic clusters is mainly attributed to both the electron donation from the asymmetrical metal atoms to the terminal side-on of N-2 molecules, which significantly polarizes and weakens the N N bond, and to the synergistic effect of the dual-metal dimers that moderates the binding strength of the key intermediates. This work constitutes the first DFT study of the N-2 electroreduction processes on dual-metal dimer catalytic sites and, consequently, paves the way towards the rational design of highly efficient hetero-bimetallic NRR electrocatalysts.

In this work, using the first-principles calculations, we have performed a systematic theoretical study of water splitting photocatalytic activity of the InSe/g-CN heterojunction. It is concluded that the InSe/g-CN heterojunction is a typical type-II semiconductor, whose electrons and holes can be effectively separated. And the potential of the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) satisfy the requirements for photolysis water. Moreover, the changes of Gibbs free energy (Delta G) of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are calculated to investigate thermodynamic sustainability of photolysis water. The results show that when pH = 7, the potential driving force provided by the InSe/g-CN heterojunction can ensure the spontaneous progress of HER and OER. In addition, it is found that the solar conversion efficiency (eta(s)) of the InSe/g-CN heterojunction is up to 13.7%, which indicates it has broad commercial application prospects.

This process is energetically driven by light-induced charge separation in the reaction center of PSII, which leads to a stepwise accumulation of oxidizing equivalents in the OEC (S-i states, i=0-4) resulting in O-2 evolution after each fourth flash, and to the reduction of plastoquinone to plastoquinol on the acceptor side of PSII. However, the S-i-state advancement is not perfect, which according to the Kok model is described by miss-hits (misses). These may be caused by redox equilibria or kinetic limitations on the donor (OEC) or the acceptor side. In this study, we investigate the effects of individual S state transitions and of the quinone acceptor side on the miss parameter by analyzing the flash-induced oxygen evolution patterns and the S-2, S-3 and S-0 state lifetimes in thylakoid samples of the extremophilic red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae. The data are analyzed employing a global fit analysis and the results are compared to the data obtained previously for spinach thylakoids. These two organisms were selected, because the redox potential of Q(A)/Q(A)(-) in PSII is significantly less negative in C. merolae (E-m=-104mV) than in spinach (E-m=-163mV). This significant difference in redox potential was expected to allow the disentanglement of acceptor and donor side effects on the miss parameter. Our data indicate that, at slightly acidic and neutral pH values, the E-m of Q(A)(-)/Q(A) plays only a minor role for the miss parameter. By contrast, the increased energy gap for the backward electron transfer from Q(A)(-) to Pheo slows down the charge recombination reaction with the S-3 and S-2 states considerably. In addition, our data support the concept that the S-2 S-3 transition is the least efficient step during the oxidation of water to molecular oxygen in the Kok cycle of PSII.					8th International Conference on Photosynthesis and Hydrogen Energy Research for Sustainability in honor of Agepati S Raghavendra, William A Cramer, and Govindjee8th International Conference on Photosynthesis and Hydrogen Energy Research for Sustainability in honor of Agepati S Raghavendra, William A Cramer, and Govindjee	20172017		Hyderabad, INDIAHyderabad, INDIA	5	0	0	0	3	0	5			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000458553100008	30191436

Comparison between derived Sol-Gel and conventional methods for the preparation of dimensionally stable Ta/IrO2 anodes for oxygen evolution								JOURNAL OF NEW MATERIALS FOR ELECTROCHEMICAL SYSTEMS				10	2			123	128						APR 2007	2007	The elaboration of inert anodes suitable for oxygen evolution in acidic media was investigated. These electrodes are formed of a tantalum substrate covered by a catalyst layer of iridium oxide IrO2. In this work, the catalyst coating was obtained by thermal decomposition of coating solutions prepared by two methods: (1) the derived Sol-Gel method using iridium acetylacetonate ([CH3COCH=C(O)CH3](3)Ir) dissolved in an isopropanol - acetic acid mixture and (2) the classic method which uses a solution of iridium tetrachloride dissolved in a ethanol - isopropanol mixture. These electrodes were characterised by electrochemical and physical techniques. The use of the derived Sol-Gel method for the preparation of Ta/IrO2 electrodes yields very active electrocatalytic layer, such an electrocatalytic coating may be expected to be used for short time electrolysis runs with high rates of production.									9	1	0	0	1	0	10			1480-2422			WOS:000245934800011

In this work, reduced graphene oxide coupled with molybdenum phosphide (MoP-RGO) is prepared through a facile and scalable one-step strategy. Three strategies are developed to tune the electrocatalytic performance of MoP-RGO including optimize the pyrolysis temperature, add NaCI template and introduction of sulfur atoms. After the optimization, the overpotentials at 10 mA cm(-2) reduced from 238 to 152 mV (alkaline electrolyte) and 232 to 144 my (acid medium), respectively. This work mainly focus on exploiting various strategies to tune the electrocatalytic performance of non-precious catalysts for HER which can provide multiple avenues to develop efficient electrocatalysts.

J	Bock, C; MacDougall, B								Novel method for the estimation of the electroactive pt area								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				150	8			E377	E383		10.1149/1.1586924				AUG 2003	2003	The (COOH)(2) oxidation reaction was studied at potentials below which the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) takes place. Pt was found to catalyze the (COOH)(2) oxidation reaction more strongly than Au, while Ru did not display any activity toward the (COOH)(2) oxidation reaction. Furthermore, under rapid stirring conditions, the (COOH)(2) oxidation reaction using Pt electrodes was shown to be activation controlled. Therefore, the (COOH)(2) oxidation currents can be related to the electroactive Pt area, as shown for a range of polycrystalline, bulk metal Pt, and Pt powder electrodes. The Pt surface area for multicomponent catalyst systems can also be estimated by combining (COOH)(2) oxidation data with the charge needed to oxidize adsorbed CO to CO2 (COads charge), as shown for a range of Pt- and Ru-containing powder electrodes. In fact, the combination of the two methods [(COOH)(2) oxidation current and COads charge] can be used as an in situ probe to estimate the fraction of Ru in the metallic state in the potential region where CO is adsorbed provided the surface ratio of Pt vs. Ru is known.

Despite progress in our understanding of oxygen redox in Li-rich compounds, the underlying origin of the initial charge capacity of Li2MnO3 remains hotly contested. To resolve this issue, we review all possible charge compensation mechanisms including bulk oxygen redox, oxidation of Mn4+, and surface degradation for Li2MnO3 cathodes displaying capacities exceeding 350 mAh g(-1). Using elemental and orbital selective X-ray spectroscopy techniques, we rule out oxidation of Mn4+ and bulk oxygen redox during activation of Li2MnO3. Quantitative gas-evolution and titration studies reveal that O-2 and CO2 release accounted for a large fraction of the observed capacity during activation with minor contributions from reduced Mn species on the surface. These studies reveal that, although Li2MnO3 is considered critical for promoting bulk anionic redox in Li-rich layered oxides, Li2MnO3 by itself does not exhibit bulk oxygen redox or manganese oxidation beyond its initial Mn4+ valence.									69	2	0	0	1	0	70			2380-8195			WOS:000514258200035

A large body of literature focuses on the different catalytic forms of XOR and their importance in the synthesis of reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species, which are involved in many disease processes. More recently, various protective physiological roles of XOR have been recognized. We summarize for the first time that XOR is a component of the innate immune system. Because XOR is involved in multiple features of innate immunity we suggest that it is central to the evolution and function of this ancient defense system. We present evidence suggesting that XOR is a direct downstream target of the evolutionarily conserved Toll-like receptor-NF-kappaB pathway and discuss that numerous forms of post-translational modification of XOR could provide intrinsic molecular switches that make XOR an ideal component of various fast innate immune responses.									145	2	0	0	117	2	149			1471-4906	1471-4981		WOS:000185450200013	12967676

The experimental results demonstrated that water vapor could increase the oxidation rate of SiC, and promote the crystallization of SiO2. By the Raman and infrared spectroscopic analyses, the existence of Si-OH vibration modes in the oxide scales indicated that the reaction between water vapor and silica could occur at high temperatures. Besides, firstprinciple molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations and the static calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) also confirmed the occurrence of the reaction and illustrated that the reaction was caused by the co-effect of O and H atoms from the water, resulting in the breakage of the Si-O bonds in silica. After oxidation for 30 h, the weight loss of CVD-SiC coated C/C samples in wet oxygen reduced to 3.47%, which was ascribed to that the formation of abundant oxide scale acted as an effective oxidation barrier by healing cracks on SiC coatings. However, the crystallization and structural variation of the oxide scale might be harmful to the long-term oxidation in the condition of high-speed gaseous scour.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000651207000001

Herein, novel hierarchical Fe2O3@Ni3Se4 nanotubes are successfully fabricated by a multistep strategy. The nanotubes show length sizes of approximate to 250-500 nm, diameter sizes of approximate to 100-150 nm, and wall thicknesses of approximate to 10 nm. The as-prepared Fe2O3@Ni3Se4 nanotubes with I-Ni:Fe = 1:10 show excellent Li storage properties (897 mAh g(-1) high reversible charge capacity at 0.1 A g(-1)), good rate performance (440 mAh g(-1) at 5 A g(-1)), and outstanding long-term cycling performance (440 mAh g(-1) at 5 A g(-1) during the 300th cycle) as an anode material for lithium ion batteries. In addition, the Fe2O3@Ni3Se4 nanotubes with I-Ni:Fe = 1:10 (the atomic ratio between Ni and Fe) show superior electrocatalytic performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction with an overpotential of only 246 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 51 mV dec(-1) in 1 m KOH solution.									34	2	0	0	1	0	35			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000430186600016	29527811

Herein, a solid-state diffusion strategy with Ni foam and N-doped carbon layers is applied to prepare multi-interfacial, self-supported and N-doped carbon nanotube (NCNT) encapsulated Ni nanoparticles (NPs) array bifunctional electrocatalyst (NCNT-NP@NF). Prominently, this NCNT-NP@NF is scalable to meet the application requirements and can be used as a binder-free electrode for direct the water splitting. The optimal sample demonstrate outstanding HER/ OER performance in 1.0 M KOH, with low overpotential (?10) at 10 mA cm-2 during HER (96.1 mV) and OER (240 mV) process, which is extremely superior to the most reported metal-based electrocatalysts and even better than commercial IrO2 (400 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for OER). Strikingly, when these bifunctional electrocatalysts are employed in a dual-electrode electrolyzer for water splitting, the NCNT-NP@NF only needs cell voltage of 1.54 V to drive overall water splitting in 1.0 M KOH, and displays excellent long-term stability (150 h for water splitting). Moreover, experiments combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations clarify that the remarkable electrochemical activity and stability are mainly attribute to the synergistic effect of the uniform distribution of Ni NPs, heteroatomic doping, as well as district confinement effect of NCNT leading to enhanced electronic multi-interfacial transmission, all these factors co-accelerate electrocatalytic kinetics. Accordingly, this solid-state diffusion method possesses a favorable potential to construct a multi-interfacial and self-supported electrocatalysts in the fields of sustainable supply of clean energies.									16	1	0	0	2	0	16			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000638224100002

Quality management of wines and redox processes								Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Conference on Management Science and Engineering Management. Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing (1191)								583	91		10.1007/978-3-030-49889-4_45				2021	2021	Wine is a dynamic system whose redox balance evolves throughout production and maturation. One of the main factors regulating the balance of this system is the presence of oxygen; the redox potential makes it possible to measure the level of oxidation or reduction of this system at any stage of evolution. Oxygen can alter the composition and quality of must and wine by participating directly or indirectly in different chemical or biochemical reactions. Phenolic compounds in wine are generally highly reactive with oxygen and potentiate its action. This reactivity, amplified by the presence of redox metal couples strongly influences the formation or disappearance of the components of aromas and taste of wines. The excess, as well as the oxygen deficiency, may be the origin of the evolution of the organoleptic characteristics of the wine, depending on the nature and quantity of the newly formed or degraded products. Thus, wine management includes as an essential component the continuous supervision of redox processes, which can directly influence its quality. The article analyzes the redox processes that lead to changes in the quality of the wine, as well as the markers of these processes.

At an oxygen pressure of 28 bar, the dissolved As in leaching solutions (0.5 M H2SO4 coexisting with arsenopyrite) existed as As(V) at room temperature. As(III) appeared increasingly with temperature rising from 100 degrees C and eventually, at temperatures greater than 200 degrees C, only As(III) was detected. The process was reversible in that the arsenic in solution was re-oxidized to As(V) during cooling. The addition of Fe3+ favored the presence of As(V) in solution. Higher initial ferric concentration required a higher temperature for the formation of As(III) and profoundly reduced the reduction rate of As(V) and enhanced the re-oxidation rate of As(III). Compared to pure oxygen, As(III) was more readily stabilized in leaching solutions using compressed air. The EXAFS data show that the As(V) in solution was coordinated with 4.1 oxygen atoms in the first shell with an average distance of 1.71 A, which indicates the presence of H3AsO4 or its deprotonated forms. Meanwhile As(III) in solution (at 225 degrees C) was coordinated with 3.1 oxygen atoms in the first shell with an average distance of 1.80 A, suggesting the presence of H3AsO3. It is concluded that the identified As(III) species in the leaching solution at elevated temperature has a significant impact on the reaction chemistry of acid pressure leaching for As-bearing sulfide.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0304-386X	1879-1158		WOS:000423644800002

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, performed between 400 and 800 degrees C as a function of pO(2), show that the electrochemical response is limited by O2-gas diffusion and surface reaction (Osurface exchange + O-ion diffusion). The time evolution of the cathode resistance at 700 degrees C in air shows an increase from 0.03 to 0.05 Omega cm(2) after 280 h of testing. Three-dimensional (3D) tomographic using focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) showed little changes of microstructure after the ageing. The increase in resistance was explained by an increase in the amount of a water-soluble Ba-rich surface phase by a factor of 2, after ageing of the LPBC electrode, by an etching procedure coupled with inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES).					15th International Symposium on Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC)15th International Symposium on Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC)	JUL 23-28, 2017JUL 23-28, 2017	Electrochem Soc Inc; SOFC Soc Japan; Electrochem Soc, High Temp MatElectrochem Soc Inc; SOFC Soc Japan; Electrochem Soc, High Temp Mat	Hollywood, FLHollywood, FL	3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1938-5862	1938-6737	978-1-60768-815-0	WOS:000432566701102

We present both raw and flux-calibrated emission-line images. Arrays of 19,440 photoionization models, with extensive input abundance ranges, were matched pixel by pixel to the calibrated data in order to derive corresponding element abundance or mass-fraction distributions for helium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. These maps show distinctive structure, and they illustrate regions of gas in which various stages of nucleosynthesis have apparently occurred, including the CNO cycle, helium burning, carbon burning, and oxygen burning. It is hoped that the calibrated observations and chemical abundance distribution maps will be useful for developing a better understanding of the precursor star evolution and the supernova explosive process.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0004-6256	1538-3881		WOS:000305418600027

Grain boundaries create strained regions in polycrystalline materials by stabilizing dislocations and may provide a way to create high-energy surfaces for catalysis that are kinetically trapped. Although grain-boundary density has previously been correlated with catalytic activity for some reactions, direct evidence that grain boundaries create surfaces with enhanced activity is lacking. We used a combination of bulk electrochemical measurements and scanning electrochemical cell microscopy with submicrometer resolution to show that grain-boundary surface terminations in gold electrodes are more active than grain surfaces for electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction to carbon monoxide (CO) but not for the competing hydrogen (H-2) evolution reaction. The catalytic footprint of the grain boundary is commensurate with its dislocation-induced strain field, providing a strategy for broader exploitation of grain-boundary effects in heterogeneous catalysis.									306	10	0	0	27	0	304			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000416584000042	29191908

It could be shown that the gas-to-liquid oxygen mass transfer is the rate determining step for the reaction. We derive a rate equation for goethite formation which is coupled to a two-dimensional growth model. Aggregation is considered with an oriented attachment model based on Brownian motion of the nanorods. Simulated and experimental results agree very well for both the length and width distributions of the particles. In particular, the new model provides a predictive tool to study the effect of process conditions on the evolution of particle size and shape.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000432884900079

In this work, a hybrid of hierarchical porous nickel-cobalt phosphide nanoneedle arrays supported micro-carbon spheres was successfully synthesized and employed as robust bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. The optimized Ni1Co3-P@CSs displayed catalytic activity with a low overpotential (eta) of 57 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution and a eta of 330 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution, along with good stability after testing for 30 h. The water splitting cell of the Ni1Co3-P@CSs delivered smaller cell voltage at a current density of 50 mA cm-2 and much better durability than a similar device based on RuO2/C and Pt/C. The enhanced performance was assumed to the unique hierarchical three-dimensional urchin nanostructure of bimetallic phosphide nano needles, which resulted in the synergetic effects to modulate electronic properties and electroactive surface area. These improved the reactant's intermediates adsorption energy, number of exposed active sites, and various shortened channels for charge transfer and reactant/electrolyte diffusion. Our finding offers an attractive electrocatalyst with low cost and high catalytic activity for efficient water electrolysis.									72	4	0	0	2	0	74			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000469904500026
