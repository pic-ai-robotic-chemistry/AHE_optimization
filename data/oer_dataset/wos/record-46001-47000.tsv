J	Ju, Jeong-Hun; Ryu, Kwang-Sun								Synthesis and electrochemical performance of Li(Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05)(0.8)(Ni0.5Mn0.5)(0.2)O-2 with core-shell structure as cathode material for Li-ion batteries								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				509	30			7985	7992		10.1016/j.jallcom.2011.05.060				JUL 28 2011	2011	The core-shell structure cathode material Li(Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05)(0.8)(Ni0.5Mn0.5)(0.2)O-2 (LNCANMO) was synthesized via a co-precipitation method. Its applicability as a cathode material for lithium ion batteries was investigated. The core-shell particle consists of LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (LNCAO) as the core and a LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 as the shell. The thickness of the LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 layer is approximately 1.25 mu m, as estimated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The cycling behavior between 2.8 and 4.3 V at a current rate of 18 mA g(-1) shows a reversible capacity of about 195 mAh g(-1) with little capacity loss after 50 cycles. High-rate capability testing shows that even at a rate of 5 C, a stable capacity of approximately 127 mAh g(-1) is retained. In contrast, the capacity of LNCAO rapidly decreases in cyclic and high rate tests. The observed higher current rate capability and cycle stability of LNCANMO can be attributed to the lower impedance including charge transfer resistance and surface film resistance. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicates that LNCANMO had a much improved oxygen evolution onset temperature of approximately 251 degrees C, and a much lower level of exothermic-heat release compared to LNCAO. The improved thermal stability of the LNCANMO can be ascribed to the thermally stable outer shell of LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2, which suppresses oxygen release from the host lattice and not directly come into contact with the electrolyte solution. In particular, LNCANMO is shown to exhibit improved electrochemical performance and is a safe material for use as an electrode for lithium ion batteries. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Employing atomic force microscopy (AFM) it is shown that the nanoparticles bind randomly to the glassy carbon electrode at a relatively low coverage of 7 x 10(4) ions mu m(-2) and that their average height is centered at 4.5 nm. Scanning transmission electron microscopy images obtained in the high-angle annular dark field mode (HAADF-STEM) further confirm that the soft-landed PtRu nanoparticles are uniform in size. Wide-area scans of the electrodes using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveal the presence of both Pt and Ru in atomic concentrations of similar to 9% and similar to 33%, respectively. Deconvolution of the high energy resolution XPS spectra in the Pt 4f and Ru 3d regions indicates the presence of both oxidized Pt and Ru. The substantially higher loading of Ru compared to Pt and enrichment of Pt at the surface of the nanoparticles is confirmed by wide-area analysis of the electrodes using time-of-flight medium energy ion scattering (TOF-MEIS) employing both 80 keV He+ and O+ ions. The activity of electrodes containing 7 x 10(4) ions mu m-2 of bare 4.5 nm PtRu nanoparticles toward the electrochemical reduction of oxygen was evaluated employing cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 0.1 M HClO4 and 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions. In both electrolytes a pronounced reduction peak was observed during O-2 purging of the solution that was not evident during purging with Ar. Repeated electrochemical cycling of the electrodes revealed little evolution in the shape or position of the voltammograms indicating high stability of the nanoparticles supported on glassy carbon. The reproducibility of the nanoparticle synthesis and deposition was evaluated by employing the same experimental parameters to prepare nanoparticles on glassy carbon electrodes on three occasions separated by several days. Surfaces with almost identical electrochemical behavior were observed with CV, demonstrating the highly reproducible preparation of bare nanoparticles using physical synthesis in the gas-phase combined with soft landing of mass-selected ions.									26	0	0	0	2	0	26			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000358207700019	26148814

Here, we propose a mechanism for the voltammetric formation of a highly active, structurally disordered beta-Ni(OH)(2)/beta-NiOOH redox pair on the surface of electrodeposited Ni thin films to achieve an extraordinary catalytic performance with respect to HCHO oxidation in alkaline media. We report electrochemical, XRD and FT-IR measurements on as-deposited and voltammetrically treated (i.e., KOH-modified) Ni thin films, and calculations based on the electrical charge to investigate the changes in the surface composition, crystal structure and related HCHO oxidation activity. We found that the KOH-modification process plays a crucial role in the formation of surface highly active, disordered beta-Ni(OH)(2)/beta-NiOOH. The KOH-modified Ni film with the largest amount of the structurally disordered beta-Ni(OH)(2)/beta-NiOOH resulted in improved catalytic performance, i.e., an onset overpotential reduced by 400 mV and a catalytic rate increased by 69 mV dec(-1). The presented technique has a wide range of applications and provides advances with a novel design idea and a new synthesis strategy for the preparation of highly active, structurally disordered Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH redox systems on the surface of Ni thin films and other Ni-based nanostructured electrocatalysts for HCHO oxidation.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000582798700002

Herein, we developed a feasible strategy based on in-situ selective surface cation exchange, for activating surface water oxidation reactivity toward boosted PEC water oxidation of BiVO4 photoanodes with fundamentally improved surface charge transfer. The asconstructed Co/BiVO4 photoanodes exhibit 2.6 times increase in photocurrent density with superior stability, in comparison to those of pristine counterpart. Moreover, the faradaic efficiency of as-fabricated photoanode can be up to similar to 95% at 1.23 V (vs. RHE). The unique selective replacement of Bi by Co on the surface could modify the electronic structure of BiVO4 with reduced energy barrier of the deprotonation of OH* to O, thus favoring the overall excellent PEC performance of Co/BiVO4 photoanode.

To make fuel-cell cars a reality, the US Department of Energy has set a fuel cell system cost target of US$30 kW(-1) in the long-term, which equates to US$2,400 per vehicle, excluding several major powertrain components (in comparison, a basic, but complete, internal combustion engine system costs approximately US$3,000). To date, most research for automotive applications has focused on proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), because these systems have demonstrated the highest power density. Recently, however, an alternative technology, hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cells (HEMFCs), has gained significant attention, because of the possibility to use stable platinum-group-metal free catalysts, with inherent, long-term cost advantages. In this Perspective, we discuss the cost profile of PEMFCs and the advantages offered by HEMFCs. In particular, we discuss catalyst development needs for HEMFCs and set catalyst activity targets to achieve performance parity with state-of-the-art automotive PEMFCs. Meeting these targets requires careful optimization of nanostructures to pack high surface areas into a small volume, while maintaining high area-specific activity and favourable pore-transport properties.									181	13	0	0	11	0	183			1748-3387	1748-3395		WOS:000389962500008	27920439

In this paper, we stress the relevant role played by nucleosynthesis in our understanding of the nova phenomenon by constraining models through a comparison with both the atomic abundance determinations from the ejecta and the isotopic ratios measured in presolar grains of a likely nova origin. We discuss first the interplay between nova outbursts and the Galactic chemical abundances: Classical nova outbursts are expected to be the major source of (13)C, (15)N and (17)O in the Galaxy, and to contribute to the abundances of other species with A < 40, such as (7)Li or (26)Al. We describe the main nuclear path during the course of the explosion, with special emphasis on the synthesis of radioactive species, of particular interest for the gamma-ray output predicted from novae ((7)Li, (18)F, (22)Na, (26)Al).					27th Symposium on Nuclear Physics27th Symposium on Nuclear Physics	JAN 05-08, 2004JAN 05-08, 2004		Taxco, MEXICOTaxco, MEXICO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0035-001X			WOS:000227329600010

The first one involved the synthesis of Co(3)O(4) nanoparticles through a nanocasting route using commercial silica gel as a sacrificial template, and in the second one, the Co(3)O(4) electrodes were prepared by thermal decomposition. The electrodes were characterized by different techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and cyclic voltammetry. EDX, XRD, and XPS show a characteristic spinel-type structure and a similar chemical composition for the two nanostructured cobalt oxides. However, the surface morphology is different. The electrochemical oxidation of cyanide and phenol in alkaline medium were used as test reactions. The electrocatalytic activity of the nanocrystalline Co(3)O(4) electrodes for cyanide and phenol oxidation turned out to be highly dependent on the electrode preparation method.

The distribution of complexes AunSx(OCS)(m)(+) formed reflects the relative reactivity of different cluster sizes with OCS, under the multiple collision conditions of our ablation source. The IR-MPD spectra of Au-n(OCS)(+) (n = 3-10) clusters are interpreted in terms of either mu(1) or mu(2) S binding motifs. Analysis of the fragmentation products following infrared excitation of parent Au-n(OCS)(+) clusters reveals strongly size-selective (odd-even) branching ratios for OCS and CO loss, respectively. CO loss signifies infrared-driven OCS decomposition on the cluster surface and is observed to occur predominantly on even n clusters (i.e., those with odd electron counts). The experimental data, including fragmentation branching ratios, are consistent with calculated potential energy landscapes, in which the initial species trapped are molecularly bound entrance channel complexes, rather than global minimum inserted structures. Attempts to generate Rh-n(OCS)(+) and Pt-n(OCS)(+) equivalents failed; only sulfide reaction products were observed in the mass spectrum, even after cooling the cluster source to -100 degrees C.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000547461000015	32491870

Heterojunction can inhibit recombination of carriers which is considered to be a reliable strategy to improve photocatalytic performance on water splitting. In this work, a "face-to-face" 2D tight heterostructure is constructed by growing ZnIn2S4 nanosheets on g-C3N4 nanosheets. Due to the ultrathin 2D structure and large amounts of N-S bonds forming at the interface of heterojunction affording charge transferring tunnel, the synthesized 2D heterojunction photocatalysts successfully accelerate the carrier migration rate and decrease recombination probability of photogenerated electrons and holes. As a result, the optimized ZISCN-50 sample has excellent photocatalytic H-2 production activity (10.92 mmol h(-1) g(-1)) under visible light, which is approximate to 5.2 times of ZnIn2S4 (2.09 mmol h(-1) g(-1)) and 136.5 times of pure g-C3N4 nanosheets (0.08 mmol h(-1) g(-1)). Cycle experiments show that the composite material has excellent stability and recyclability. This work provides fresh insights into atomic-level structure and interface design in order to synthesize high-efficiency 2D/2D heterojunction photocatalysts.									20	0	0	0	3	0	20			2196-7350			WOS:000633509800001

Freshwater inputs and multiple acid-base reactions change carbonate chemistry conditions, sometimes synergistically. The shallow nature of these systems results in strong benthic-pelagic coupling, and marine invertebrates at different life history stages rely on both benthic and pelagic habitats. Carbonate chemistry in coastal systems can be highly variable, responding to processes with temporal modes ranging from seconds to centuries. Identifying scales of variability relevant to levels of biological organization requires a fuller characterization of both the frequency and magnitude domains of processes contributing to or reducing acidification in pelagic and benthic habitats. We review the processes that contribute to coastal acidification with attention to timescales of variability and habitats relevant to marine bivalves.									255	2	0	0	204	0	263			1941-1405		978-0-8243-4506-8	WOS:000329657800011	23987912

In addition to a tetramanganese-oxo (Mn-4) Cluster, calcium and chloride ions, the OEC also contains Tyrosine Z(Y-Z), a redox intermediate in the water oxidation reaction. The redox mechanism employed by Y-Z is under much debate. Using a novel method to study Y-Z oxidation based on the kinetic competition with secondary donors, we examine the electron-donation pathways of manganese-depleted PSII over a range of temperature and pH. H/D substitution causes a shift in the onset temperature for Y-Z oxidation, enabling measurements of lyonium. isotope effects. In deuterated samples, the onset temperature for Y-Z oxidation is upshifted, suggesting that proton movement is a required step. Proton inventory experiments were performed to determine the number of protons that shift during the Y-Z oxidation reaction. Our findings indicate the movement of a single proton during the rate-limiting step of the oxidation process. The results presented herein demonstrate a need for proton movement in conjunction with Y-Z oxidation and support previous proposals that a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) step is necessary for oxidation of Y-Z. The possible involvement of PCET in the energetics of specific steps in the mechanism of water oxidation is discussed.									44	0	0	0	25	0	44			1520-6106			WOS:000177472800030

Quantitative models of organic matter degradation are therefore essential for understanding the chemical state and evolution of the Earth's near-surface environment, and to forecast the biogeochemical consequences of ongoing regional and global change. The complex nature of biologically produced organic matter represents a major obstacle to the development of such models, however. Here, we compare the energetics of the oxidative degradation of a large number of naturally occurring organic compounds. By relating the Gibbs energies of half reactions describing the complete mineralization of the compounds to their average nominal carbon oxidation state, it becomes possible to estimate the energetic potential of the compounds based on major element (C, H, N, O, P, S) ratios. The new energetic description of organic matter can be combined with bioenergetic theory to rationalize observed patterns in the decomposition of natural organic matter. For example, the persistence of cell membrane derived compounds and complex organics in anoxic settings is consistent with their limited catabolic potential under these environmental conditions. The proposed approach opens the way to include the thermodynamic properties of organic compounds in kinetic models of organic matter degradation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				647	2			1106	1124		10.1086/505556				AUG 20 2006	2006	Analyses of spectra obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) satellite, together with spectra from the Copernicus and interstellar medium absorption profile spectrograph (IMAPS) instruments, reveal an unexplained, very wide range in the observed deuterium/hydrogen (D/H) ratios for interstellar gas in the Galactic disk beyond the Local Bubble. We argue that spatial variations in the depletion of deuterium onto dust grains can explain these local variations in the observed gas-phase D/H ratios. We present a variable deuterium depletion model that naturally explains the constant measured values of D/H inside the Local Bubble, the wide range of gas-phase D/H ratios observed in the intermediate regime [log N(H I) = 19.2-20.7], and the low gas-phase D/H ratios observed at larger hydrogen column densities. We consider empirical tests of the deuterium depletion hypothesis: ( 1) correlations of gas-phase D/H ratios with depletions of the refractory metals iron and silicon, and (2) correlation with the H-2 rotational temperature. Both of these tests are consistent with deuterium depletion from the gas phase in cold, not recently shocked regions of the ISM, and high gas-phase D/H ratios in gas that has been shocked or otherwise heated recently. We argue that the most representative value for the total (gas plus dust) D/H ratio within 1 kpc of the Sun is >= 23.1 +/- 2.4(1 sigma) parts per million (ppm). This ratio constrains Galactic chemical evolution models to have a very small deuterium astration factor, the ratio of primordial to total (D/H) ratio in the local region of the Galactic disk, which we estimate to be f(d) <= 1.19(-0.15)(+0.16)(1 sigma) or <= 1.12 +/- 0.14(1 sigma) depending on the adopted light-element nuclear reaction rates.									244	1	1	0	2	0	245			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000239830000032

Although Pt-based materials have the best catalytic activity for HER, their high price and scarcity greatly limit their large-scale industrial application prospects. Herein, a new method to prepare HER catalyst is described, where dyes used in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were used as precursors. A high performance HER catalyst (Ru@N/S/TiO2/rGO, Ru nanoparticles (NPs) supported on N/S-doped TiO2/rGO hybrids) was prepared, and the stereoscopic molecular structure of the porphyrin dye, JR1, not only provides a prerequisite for the preparation of the hyperdispersed Ru NPs, but also successfully realizes N/S co-doping. The Ru@N/S/TiO2/rGO shows an excellent catalytic performance for the HER, which is almost the same as that with Pt/C. In 0.5 M H2SO4, the overpotential is 60 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and the Tafel slope is only 51 mV dec(-1). In 1 M KOH, the overpotential is only 5 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and the Tafel slope is only 45 mV dec(-1), and this performance is much better than most of the HER catalysts that have been reported. When Ru@N/S/TiO2/rGO is utilized as a catalyst in an alkaline water electrolyzer, a bias of only 1.52 V is able to complement overall water-splitting at 10 mA cm(-2) (1.78 V, 100 mA cm(-2)). The molecular structure and coordination metal species of the dyes are easy to adjust, and the the stereoscopic structure is very helpful for inhibiting the aggregation of the metal NPs, and the strong anchoring effect with TiO2 or other carbon materials is also very helpful to achieve heteroatom doping. In addition, the process of dye-sensitization is simple and repeatable, and is a novel and efficient method to prepare the electrocatalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000709001200001	34668512

Ni(II)-Cr(III) LDH is synthesized in the absence and in the presence of functionalized amino-organic compounds such as acetamide, glycine, and urea. The ratio between CrCl3 center dot 6H(2)O: NiCl2 center dot 6H(2)O: NaCl: acetamide, glycine or urea was 1:2:3:6. The mixed nickel-chromium oxide nanoparticles are prepared by the calcination of Ni(II)-Cr(III) LDHs at 600 celcius for 2.5 h. Ni(II)-Cr(III) LDHs and mixed Ni(II)-Cr(III) oxides nanoparticles are characterized by several techniques including FTIR, TGA, XRD, FESEM, HRTEM, and PL. Functionalized amino-organic compounds improve the thermal stability in the order of glycine > urea > acetamide. Also, it affects photoluminescence PL intensity which indicates a marked reduction in electron-hole recombination with the highest photocatalytic activity compared to visible light-driven H-2 and O-2 evolution. The resulting mixed Ni(II)-Cr(III) oxides particles have an amorphous structure and a relatively uniform size of below 10 nm.[GRAPHICS].									43	0	0	0	0	1	43			0947-8396	1432-0630		WOS:000482465400001

Even though much progress has been made over the past decade, the effectiveness and robustness of PEC cells are still far from a mature phase that would allow for widespread deployment. This perspective discusses the key challenges facing the current level of PEC development and proposes experimental approaches and strategies that can be adopted to address the issues. Focuses are mainly placed on the employment of in situ and operando spectroscopic measurements, the introduction of alternative, high value-added oxidation reactions, and the creation of near infrared-responsive photoelectrodes. A brief outlook that may assist the future advancement of PEC technology is also presented. (c) 2019 Author(s).

In base electrolyte at pH 9, the Ir(IV)/Ir(III) surface redox couple exhibits unusually large separation of the oxidation/reduction peaks (Delta E-p similar to 750 mV) due to the local pH changes within the oxide film. These local pH changes are induced by protons released/consumed during the Ir(IV)Ir(III) redox activity. As a consequence, the local pH within AIROF changed up to 10 units during potential cycling. The presence of ammonia at pH 9 prevents these local pH changes because NH4+/NH3 buffer the solution inside the electrode. As a consequence, Delta E-p of Ir(IV)/Ir(III) was reduced 100 mV. It has been shown further that ammonia oxidation is mediated by Ir(V), resulting in the appearance of anodic peaks in forward and back-ward scans. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	DIMARCO, G; TRICOLI, D								EFFECT OF WATER-DEFICIT ON PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND ELECTRON-TRANSPORT IN WHEAT GROWN IN A NATURAL-ENVIRONMENT								JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				142	2			156	160		10.1016/S0176-1617(11)80956-9				AUG 1993	1993	O2 evolution and fluorescence were measured simultaneously on leaf discs of durum wheat. Field-grown plants and plants grown in pots in a natural environment were compared with water-stressed plants. In saturating CO2 the biochemical reactions of photosynthesis are not very sensitive to water stress, and electron transport is entirely used for CO2 reduction. The decrease in maximum photosynthetic capacity appears to be related to relative water content and not to leaf water potential. Simultaneous measurements of CO2 uptake and fluorescence of attached leaves at natural CO2 concentrations show that the electron transport rate exceeds the requirement of photosynthetic carbon oxidative and reductive cycles. This suggests that photoreduction Of O2 in natural conditions could occur at higher rates than generally believed, due to the presence of alternative reductions. No evidence of differences between stressed plants and irrigated controls in the way the leaves use photosynthetic electrons was obtained. However, senescence of the leaves probably interferes and masks the effects of the drought.									8	0	0	0	8	0	8			0176-1617			WOS:A1993LW36400005

PCC 6803 as well as in the chloroplasts of green plants. The putative product of the psbJ gene is a 4-kDa protein with one membrane-spanning domain. We have raised rabbit antibodies against a T7 gene 10-psbJ fusion protein, overexpressed in Escherichia coli. These antibodies recognized a polypeptide of expected size in the thylakoid membrane from wild type Synechocystis cells. We have also created a targeted mutant of Synechocystis 6803 in which the fourth codon of the psbJ open reading frame was modified to a translational stop codon. Thylakoid membranes from these mutant cells lacked the protein recognized by the antibodies. In the mutant cells, the partial electron transfer reaction mediated by the photosystem I complex was unaffected, whereas the rate of the photosystem II (PSII)-mediated reaction was 46% of that in wild type cells. Herbicide binding assays indicated that the PSII to chlorophyll ratio in the mutant cells was 49% of that in wild type cells. These results indicate that while the PsbJ protein is not essential for the photochemical activity it controls the amount of functionally assembled PSII complex in the thylakoid membrane.									40	1	0	0	38	0	41			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:A1993KH62000014	8420932

Based on this, herein, we fabricated a bamboo leaves-like amorphous FeOx (x = 1, 1.5) coated Cu3P with outstanding HER performance in alkaline media for the first time. FeOxH2O was synthesized by the reducibility of glycol and the oxidability of soluble O-2, and the bamboo leaves-like structure was induced by solvent molecule selective adsorption simultaneously. The binder-free FeOx coated Cu3P@Cu was fabricated as the catalyst for HER in 1 M KOH, which demonstrated a quite low overpotential of 48 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and was even better than that of Pt/C catalyst at a large current density. This work provided a strategy to fabricate a high-performance copper-based HER electro-catalyst.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521938400041

The composition and coordination would determine the geometric and electronic structures of SACs, and thus greatly influence the catalytic performance. Based on atom economy, rational design and controllable synthesis of SACs have become central tasks in the fields of low-cost and green catalysis. Herein, an introduction to the recent progress in the precise synthesis of SACs including the regulation of the coordination structure and the choice of different systems is presented. Thereafter, the potentials of SACs in different applications are comprehensively summarized and discussed. Furthermore, a detailed discussion of the recent developments regarding the large-scale preparation of SACs is provided, including the major issues and prospects for industrialization.

Previously we demonstrated that through the addition of Cr to Ni, a significant improvement in the continuity of ultra-thin Ni electrodes in Ni-BaTiO3 multilayer capacitors could be achieved. Here, the effect of the Cr addition to the nickel electrode pastes is studied with regard to the electrical properties. Low-field electrical measurements demonstrate no major differences between Cr doped Ni and undoped Ni. However, high-field measurements show a significant decrease to the total capacitor resistance. Under a critical electrical bias the conductivity significantly increases due to a Fowler-Nordheim tunneling conduction though the interfacial Schottky barrier at the dielectric-electrode interface; the onset voltage of this conduction is much lower than with the undoped nickel. Based on these results, we evaluate criteria for the selection of an appropriate refractory metal in order to improve the Ni electrode continuity.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1385-3449	1573-8663		WOS:000268772500002

JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				123	23			14591	14609		10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b04745				JUN 13 2019	2019	Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) is an excellent strategy for addressing the issue of both ever-increasing anthropogenic CO2 emissions as well as the rapid diminishing of nonrenewable fossil reserves. Recently, significant attention has focused on the development of size-selected subnanometer nanocatalysts because of the unique electronic, geometric, and catalytic properties of these clusters, which often exhibit enhanced catalytic activities and selectivities compared to bulk metal catalysts and larger nanoparticles. In this paper, we investigate in detail the electrocatalytic activity of size-selected Cu-n clusters (n = 3-6) employing the computational hydrogen electrode model. We have found a striking similarity between the CO2RR activity of Cu-3 and Cu-5 and between Cu-4, and Cu-6 nanoclusters. The reaction proceeds through * + CO2 -> COOH* -> CO* + H2O -> CHO* -> CH2O* -> CH3O* -> O* + CH4 -> OH* -> * + H2O as in the case of copper surface on all Cu clusters. The rate-limiting potential on Cu-4 and Cu-6 clusters is the proton-electron (H+ + e(-)) transfer to CO* to form the CHO* adsorbed species, which is also the rate-limiting step on Cu surfaces, whereas on Cu-3 and Cu-5 clusters, it is the removal of the adsorbed OH* from the cluster surface (OH* -> * + H2O). Most importantly, we have identified a general trend in the exergonicity and endergonicity of each step with the spin-state of the nanocluster. In general, electrochemical steps corresponding to an odd total number of (H+ + e(-)) pair transfers, leading to the formation of the doublet adsorbed species on Cu-4 and Cu-6 clusters, are highly endergonic uphill processes relative to the same steps on Cu-3 and Cu-5 clusters. However, the steps corresponding to an even total number of proton-electron pair transfers, leading to the formation of singlet adsorbed species on Cu-4 and Cu-6 clusters, are highly exergonic downhill processes relative to the same steps on Cu-3 and Cu-5. We have also found that the competing hydrogen evolution reaction is more hindered on Cu-3 and Cu-5 compared to Cu-4 and Cu-6 clusters. There is also a general qualitative relationship between the exer/endergonicity of an electrochemical step and the HOMO-LUMO gap of the various cluster-adsorbate complexes. We have found that an increase or decrease of a single valence electron can significantly alter the electrocatalytic activity and reactivity on the subnanometer level, and this has great implications in the design and development of size-selected nanoclusters for CO2RR and similar reactions.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000471834000054

These researches have oriented in two directions; one focuses on obtaining better understanding of the reported mysterious catalyst layer, further modification, and improved performance, and the second approach is about designing coordination complexes of cobalt and investigating their properties toward the application in water splitting. Although there have been critical debates on true catalysts that are responsible for water oxidation in homogeneous systems of coordination complexes of cobalt, and the case is not totally closed, in this short review, our focus will be mainly on recent major progress and developments in the design and the application of cobalt oxide-based materials in catalytic, electrocatalytic, photocatalytic, and photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation reaction, which have been reported since pioneering report of Nocera in 2008 (Kanan Matthew and Nocera Daniel in Science 321:1072-1075, 2008).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000864226700001	36195743

Because energy conversion efficiency is high, no noise and pollution. Proton exchange membrane fuel cell ( PEMFC) is one of the most widely used fuel cells, but PEMFC still has some problems to be solved, such as high cost, low power density and poor catalyst stability. Therefore, to achieve the large-scale application of proton exchange membrane fuel cell, research and development of high activity and high stability catalyst is the top priority. In order to meet the requirements of high activity and high stability of fuel cell catalysts, this paper reviews the research progress and performance improvement methods of catalysts for fuel cells. The methods to improve the stability of fuel cell were discussed from the perspectives of active components and carrier. The performance of catalyst was improved by reducing the diameter of active component particles, preparing platinum particles with specific orientation surface, alloying platinum with transition metals and the modification of carrier also had a significant impact on the stability of catalyst. Finally, the future development direction of fuel cell catalysts and the main problems in practical application are proposed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1005-281X			WOS:000833506200016

The obtained complex was characterized by elemental analysis, spectroscopic techniques and single crystal X-ray analysis. The complex was studied as a water oxidizing catalyst and its electrocatalytic activity in the water oxidation reaction was tested in 0.5 M of borate buffer at pH = 3, 7 and 11 in a typical three-electrode setup with a carbon paste electrode modified by complex 1 as a working electrode. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves indicated that complex 1 has a much superior activity and only needs 21 mV vs. Ag/AgCl overvoltage to reach a geometrical catalytic current density of 2.0 mA cm(-2) at pH = 11. The onset potential decreased from 1.15 V to 0.67 V vs. Ag/AgCl with an increase of pH from 3 to 13 under a constant current density of 1.0 mA cm(-2). Then, to determine the true catalyst for the water oxidation reaction in the presence of complex 1 at pH = 3, 7 and 11, cyclic voltammetry was also performed. The continuous CVs for complex 1 at neutral and alkaline solutions showed significant progress for the water oxidation reaction. In addition, the amperometry tests exhibited excellent stability and high constant current density for water oxidation by CPE-complex 1 under electrochemical conditions at pH = 11 and 7. Although X-ray powder diffraction analysis did not show a pure and crystalline structure for NiOx, the scanning electron microscopy images showed that nickel oxide at pH = 11 and nickel oxide or other Ni-based compounds at pH = 7 are true water oxidizing catalysts on the surface of a CPE electrode. Moreover at pH = 3, no clear water oxidation or NiOx formation was observed.									18	1	0	0	2	0	18				2046-2069		WOS:000503810800030	35542637

Although single crystal electrodes are typically used for such studies, the one-at-a-time preparation procedure limits the range of secondary crystallographic orientations that can be profiled. This work employs scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) together with co-located electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) as a screening technique to investigate how surface crystallographic orientations on polycrystalline copper (Cu) correlate to activity under CO2 electroreduction conditions. SECCM measures spatially resolved voltammetry on polycrystalline copper covering low overpotentials of CO2 conversion to intermediates, thereby screening the different activity from low-index facets where H2 evolution is dominant to high-index facets where more reaction intermediates are expected. This approach allows the acquisition of 2500 voltammograms on approximately 60 different Cu surface facets identified with EBSD. The results show that the order of activity is (111) < (100) < (110) among the Cu primary orientations. The collection of data over a wide range of secondary orientations leads to the construction of an "electrochemical-crystallographic stereographic triangle" that provides a broad comprehension of the trends among Cu secondary surface facets rarely studied in the literature, [particularly (941) and (741)], and clearly shows that the electroreduction activity scales with the step and kink density of these surfaces. This work also reveals that the electrochemical stripping of the passive layer that is naturally formed on Cu in air is strongly grain-dependent, and the relative ease of stripping on low-index facets follows the order of (100) > (111) > (110). This allows a procedure to be implemented, whereby the oxide is removed (to an electrochemically undetectable level) prior to the kinetic analyses of electroreduction activity. SECCM screening allows for the most active surfaces to be ranked and prompts in-depth follow-up studies.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000822507300001	35692254

The structural evolution of the samples obtained at different stages are characterized by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and N-2 adsorption-desorption analyses. MnO2 as a pillared agent can stabilize the layered structure against thermal treatment, and porous Co2+-Ni2+-Fe3+ layered double hydroxide nanocomposite is obtained by heating the MnO2 pillared material at appropriate temperatures. The basal spacing of the obtained intermediates changes with the radius of the pillar species in the interlayer and the layered structure with larger surface area can maintain to 300 degrees C. The as prepared MnO2-LDHs (200) material not only has large specific surface area of 145 m(2) g(-1), but also shows an ideal capacitance of 389 F g(-1) at a scan rate of 5 mV s(-1) and good capacitance retention of 92.3% after 500 cycles at a scan rate of 20 mV s(-1) in 1 mol L-1 KOH solution, making this material has a potential application as supercapacitor electrode material.

The reactions were followed by ferrous oxidation-xylenol orange method together with GC-MS and GC-FID, allowing to observe that both oxidation systems are different in terms of hydroperoxide evolution, probably due to the presence of different intermediate reactive species: perferryl ion and OH radical responsible for the decomposition of lipid hydroperoxides and formation of new compounds.The analysis of ESI-MS in the negative mode, obtained after oxidation of each fatty acid, confirmed the presence of the monomeric oxidation products together with other compounds at high mass region above m/z 550. These new ions were attributed to oligomeric structures, identified by the fragmentation pathways observed in the tandem mass spectra.

However, the limited photocatalytic activity in the inert basal plane hinders its practical application. Here, we propose a heteroatom doping strategy to improve the catalytic activity of the monolayer MoSSe (ML-MoSSe) via charge compensated (N+F) and double-hole mediated (N+1=) co-doping. We investigate the possibility of applying co-doped ML-MoSSe as the photocatalyst for water splitting by the first-principles calculations. The calculated results show that the N+F co-doped ML-MoSSe have the relatively higher thermodynamic stability and the reduced direct band gaps in the range of 1.28(similar to)1.57 eV with their band edge position satisfying the requirement of the redox potential of water at pH = 0 under the intrinsic polarized electric field. In particular, the doped N sites exhibit highly photocatalytic activity for hydrogen reduction reaction (HER). This work demonstrates that N+F co-doped ML-MoSSe might be a promising photocatalyst that possesses high catalytic activity for HER and simultaneously maintains the intrinsic polarized electric field to facilitate the separation of photogenerated carrier, which will shed light on screening the MoSSe-based photocatalyst.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000618281500008

Herein we show that a positive O-17 excess in NO3- (Delta O-17(NO3) = delta O-17(NO3) -0.52 delta O-18(NO3)) is preserved in the paleo-groundwater. The 17O excess provides an excellent tracer of atmospheric NO3-, which is caused by the interaction of ozone with NOx via photochemical reactions, coupled with a non-mass-dependent isotope fractionation. Our Delta(ONO3)-O-17 data from 0.4 to 5.0 parts per thousand (n = 28) indicate that up to 20 mol% of total dissolved NO3- originated from the Earth's atmosphere (x[NO3-](atm)), where the remaining NO3- refers to microbially induced nitrification in soils. High Delta O-17(NO3) values correspond to soils that are barren in dry periods, while low Delta O-17(NO3) values correspond to more fertile soils. Coupled high Delta O-17(NO3) and high x[NO3-](atm) values are caused by a sudden wash-out of accumulated disposition of atmospheric NO3- on plants, soil surfaces and in vadose zones within humid-wet cycles. The individual isotope and chemical composition of the Hasouna groundwater can be followed by a binary mixing approach using the lowest and highest mineralised groundwater as end members without considering evaporation. Using the delta S-34(SO4) and delta O-18(SO4) isotope signature of dissolved SO42-, no indication is found for a superimposition by denitrification, e. g. involving pyrite minerals within the aquifers. It is suggested that dissolved SO42- originates from the dissolution of CaSO4 minerals during groundwater evolution.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			1726-4170	1726-4189		WOS:000338761200005

There is, however, a striking lack of electroless plating procedures for the rarer platinum-group metals. In this work, two plating baths for nanoscale iridium coatings are developed and their conformality and nanofabrication potential are showcased by coating ion-track-etched polycarbonate membranes, creating Ir nanotubes in the process. Both plating solutions yield morphologically different deposits, indicating that the microstructure of the film can be tuned by adjusting the composition of the plating bath. The catalytic performance of the deposited materials is investigated by using membrane-embedded nanotubes as catalysts for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol and methyl orange by borohydride, showing remarkable activity and stability. Operation in flow-through configuration, in which the metallized membrane is implemented as a microreactor greatly enhances the interaction with the catalyst surface, considerably increasing product yield. The results highlight the potential of Ir nanoplating for realizing sophisticated nanostructures and heterogeneous catalysts, but also illustrate the intricacies related to the complex chemistry of electroless Ir plating baths.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2196-0216			WOS:000567306600013

Herein, sulfur doped terminal-methylated g-C3N4 nanosheets (SMCNs) with a tunable bandgap have been prepared for the first time by employing thioacetamide as both the sulfur source and blocking agent. Experimental and DFT studies identify that introducing methyl into the melon framework not only acts as a blocking group during the polymerization reaction to generate the structure edge defects, but also reduces the energy barrier of sulfur atom doping. Specifically, doping sulfur atoms into the methylated melon units can split the valence band near the Fermi level to generate a new empty midgap electronic state, which leads to a significant decrease of the bandgap by about 0.7 eV and extends the light-responsive region up to 700 nm. Moreover, due to the changed local charge distribution and lattice strain, the resulting internal electric field is beneficial for the separation of electron-hole pairs. Thus, the as-synthesized SMCNs exhibit an outstanding photocatalytic performance in the degradation of reactive dyes and photocatalytic H2 generation.									69	5	0	0	12	0	69			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000488618600017

The as-synthesized Ru nanoparticles with an average particle size of 1.41 nm were dispersed uniformly on the HPCM surface (Ru/HPCM). The Ru/HPCM catalyst exhibited a high turnover frequency of 440 min(-1) and could be reused for eight times in hydrogen generation from ammonia borane hydrolysis. The enhanced catalytic activity of Ru/HPCM could be attributed to the numerous active surface areas provided by ultrafine monodisperse Ru nanoparticles for the reaction. The confinement space of the support and the abundant surface functional groups increased the stability and reusability of the Ru/HPCM catalyst. This facile strategy for synthesis of ultrafine monodisperse metal nanoparticles with high catalytic activity and reusability shows potential for practical applications.									56	1	0	0	2	0	57			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000438578700039

Ulrich/0000-0002-4168-781X			Reactive transport modeling in fractured rock: A state-of-the-science review								EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS				72	3-4			189	227		10.1016/j.earscirev.2005.07.003				OCT 2005	2005	The field of reactive transport modeling has expanded significantly in the past two decades and has assisted in resolving many issues in Earth Sciences. Numerical models allow for detailed examination of coupled transport and reactions, or more general investigation of controlling processes over geologic time scales. Reactive transport models serve to provide guidance in field data collection and, in particular, enable researchers to link modeling and hydrogeochemical studies. In this state-of-science review, the key objectives were to examine the applicability of reactive transport codes for exploring issues of redox stability to depths of several hundreds of meters in sparsely fractured crystalline rock, with a focus on the Canadian Shield setting.A conceptual model of oxygen ingress and redox buffering, within a Shield environment at time and space scales relevant to nuclear waste repository performance, is developed through a review of previous research. This conceptual model describes geochemical and biological processes and mechanisms materially important to understanding redox buffering capacity and radionuclide mobility in the far-field. Consistent with this model, reactive transport codes should ideally be capable of simulating the effects of changing recharge water compositions as a result of long-term climate change, and fracture-matrix interactions that may govern water-rock interaction. Other aspects influencing the suitability of reactive transport codes include the treatment of various reaction and transport time scales, the ability to apply equilibrium or kinetic formulations simultaneously, the need to capture feedback between water-rock interactions and porosity-permeability changes, and the representation of fractured crystalline rock environments as discrete fracture or dual continuum media.A review, of modem multicomponent reactive transport codes indicates a relatively high-level of maturity. Within the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste disposal program, reactive transport codes of varying complexity have been applied to investigate the migration of radionuclides and the geochemical evolution of host rock around the planned disposal facility. Through appropriate near- and far-field application of dual continuum codes, this example demonstrates how reactive transport models have been applied to assist in constraining historic water infiltration rates, interpreting the sealing of flow paths due to mineral precipitation, and investigating post-closure geochemical monitoring strategies. Natural analogue modeling studies, although few in number, are also of key importance as they allow the comparison of model results with hydrogeochemical and paleohydrogeological data over geologic time scales.

This paper reports a facile method to prepare dendritic hematite nanorods and an active catalytic interface was constructed by coordinating ferrous lactate layers. A negative shift of 100 mV for onset potential and significant enhancement (200%) of photocurrent were observed for the modified hematite photoanodes. It was found that ferrous lactate decorated samples showed distinct catalytic effect for water oxidation only in illuminated condition. XPS and a series photo-electrochemical analysis reveal that Fe (II) site in the surface bonded ferrous lactate possessed distinguished photo-generated charge transfer properties and excellent stability during the reaction. The corresponding mechanism for water oxidation over catalytic surface was proposed. The result provides a facile and reliable surface modification method for efficient PEC water oxidation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0038-092X	1471-1257		WOS:000754382300004

Controls on methane flux to the atmosphere were of particular consequence; too much methane would have inhibited a persistent rise of O-2, but too little may have plunged Earth into severe and prolonged ice ages. Here, we document a shift in the weathering reactions controlling the ocean-bound flux of nickel-an essential micronutrient for the organisms that produced methane in Precambrian oceans-by applying Ni stable isotope analysis to Mesoarchaean and Palaeoproterozoic glacial sediments. Although Ni flux to the ocean dropped dramatically as Ni content of the continental crust decreased, the onset of sulfide weathering delivered a small, but vital, flux of Ni to the oceans, sustaining sufficient methane production to prevent a permanent icehouse, while allowing O-2 to rise.									24	2	0	0	6	0	25			1752-0894	1752-0908		WOS:000462621700016

These wafers were poled under various poling fields to study the effect of electric poling on the pyroelectric catalysis performance during the process of dye decomposition. Under 140 cold-hot (28 - 60 degrees C) cycles, the dye decomposition ratio using the unpoled BaTiO3 catalyst is close to 0, whereas it reaches similar to 56% using the BaTiO3 poled under a poling field of similar to 5.00 kV/mm. The poling treatment shows a great influence on the pyroelectric catalysis since it directly affects the number of charges generated on the surface of BaTiO3 crystal under the external temperature variation excitation. The generation of these middle product hydroxyl radicals further proves the reaction mechanism of the pyroelectric catalysis. The good catalysis and recyclability performance suggests the poled BaTiO3 pyroelectric crystal is an potential material in dye wastewater remediation through utilizing room-temperature thermal energy.									22	1	0	0	0	0	22			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000533512000121

The uniformly distributed Co-Mn nanosheets lead to a remarkable 2.6-fold enhancement on the photocurrent density at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and an impressive cathodic shift (approximate to 200 mV) of onset potential compared with bare alpha-Fe2O3 film. Furthermore, the decorated photoanode exhibits a prominent resistance against photocorrosion with excellent stability for over 10 h. Detailed mechanism investigation manifests that incorporation of Mn sites in the nanosheets could create electron donation to Co sites and facilitate the activation of the OH group, which drastically increases the catalytic activities for water oxidation.

At the finest level, the distribution of the 2 phases is at the nanoscale. By means of atomic resolution STEM and electron diffraction, the nanocomposite regions were shown to consist of a dense array of metallic copper platelets dispersed in a matrix of -Al2O3. The copper nanoplatelets were single crystal, and they all exhibited the same orientation relationship with the matrix, namely [110](cu)//[010](theta-Al2O3). (III)(cu)//(4 0 2)(theta-Al2O3). it was shown that the 2-phase regions where the copper exhibited a significantly coarser, globular morphology, resulted from discontinuous coarsening. Interestingly, a change in the matrix phase from theta- to delta-alumina was also observed as a result of the coarsening reaction. It is believed that in the nanocomposite regions, the theta-alumina phase was stabilized by the lower interfacial energy between the copper (110) platelets and the matrix.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000446172000052

Elimination of hazardous pollutants, particularly phenol from water is urgent for environment remediation due to its significant carcinogenicity. Considering this aspect, the Au-Pd/g-C3N4 and Au-Pd/rGO nanocomposites are used as photocatalyst towards degradation of toxic phenol, 2-chlorophenol (2-CP) and 2-nitrophenol (2-NP) under natural sunlight and UV light irradiation. Au-Pd/g-C3N4 nanocomposite exhibited higher activity then Au/g-C3N4, Pd/g-C3N4 and Au-Pd/rGO nanocomposites with more than 95% degradation in 180 min under sunlight. The obtained degradation efficiency of our materials is better than many other reported photocatalysts. Incorporation of nitrogen atoms in the carbon skeleton of g-C3N4 provides much better properties to Au-Pd/g-C3N4 nanocomposite than carbon based Au-Pd/rGO leading to its higher degradation efficiency. Due to the presence of these nitrogen atoms and some defects, g-C3N4 possesses appealing electrical, chemical and functional properties. Photoluminescence results further revealed the efficient charge separation and delayed recombination of photo-induced electron-hole pairs in the Au-Pd/g-C3N4 nanocomposite. Generation of reactive oxygen species during photocatalysis is well explained through photoluminescence study and the sustainability of these photocatalyst was ascertained through reusability study up to eight and five consecutive cycles for Au-Pd/g-C3N4 and Au-Pd/rGO nanocomposites, respectively without substantial loss in its activity. Characterization of the photocatalysts after reaction signified the stability of the nanocomposites and added advantage to our developed photocatalytic system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this scenario, the link between hydrogen and renewable energy is playing a key role and unitized hydrogen-chlorine (H-2-Cl-2) regenerative cells (RFCs) have become promising candidates for renewable energy storage. Described herein are the recent advances in cell configurations and catalysts for the different reactions that may take place in these systems, that work in both modes: electrolysis and fuel cell. It has been found that platinum (Pt)-based catalysts are the best choice for the electrode where hydrogen is involved, whereas for the case of chlorine, ruthenium (Ru)-based catalysts are the best candidates. Only a few studies were found where the catalysts had been tested in both modes and recent advances are focused on decreasing the amount of precious metals contained in the catalysts. Moreover, the durability of the catalysts tested under realistic conditions has not been thoroughly assessed, becoming a key and mandatory step to evaluate the commercial viability of the H-2-Cl-2 RFC technology.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8				2073-4344		WOS:000592743000001

OMEN-SED explicitly describes organic matter (OM) cycling and the associated dynamics of the most important terminal electron acceptors (i.e. O-2, NO3, SO4) and methane (CH4), related reduced substances (NH4, H2S), macronutrients (PO4) and associated pore water quantities (ALK, DIC). Its reaction network accounts for the most important primary and secondary redox reactions, equilibrium reactions, mineral dissolution and precipitation, as well as adsorption and desorption processes associated with OM dynamics that affect the dissolved and solid species explicitly resolved in the model. To represent a redox-dependent sedimentary P cycle we also include a representation of the formation and burial of Fe-bound P and authigenic Ca-P minerals. Thus, OMEN-SED is able to capture the main features of diagenetic dynamics in marine sediments and therefore offers similar predictive abilities as a complex, numerical diagenetic model. Yet, its computational efficiency allows for its coupling to global Earth system models and therefore the investigation of coupled global biogeochemical dynamics over a wide range of climate-relevant timescales. This paper provides a detailed description of the new sediment model, an extensive sensitivity analysis and an evaluation of OMEN-SED's performance through comprehensive comparisons with observations and results from a more complex numerical model. We find that solid-phase and dissolved pore water profiles for different ocean depths are reproduced with good accuracy and simulated terminal electron acceptor fluxes fall well within the range of globally observed fluxes. Finally, we illustrate its application in an Earth system model framework by coupling OMEN-SED to the Earth system model cGENIE and tune the OM degradation rate constants to optimise the fit of simulated benthic OM contents to global observations. We find that the simulated sediment characteristics of the coupled model framework, such as OM degradation rates, oxygen penetration depths and sediment-water interface fluxes, are generally in good agreement with observations and in line with what one would expect on a global scale. Coupled to an Earth system model, OMENSED is thus a powerful tool that will not only help elucidate the role of benthic-pelagic exchange processes in the evolution and the termination of a wide range of climate events, but will also allow for a direct comparison of model output with the sedimentary record-the most important climate archive on Earth.									16	0	0	0	3	0	16			1991-959X	1991-9603		WOS:000437882900001

However, the results did not enable a decision whether the active oxidant is a Cu-III or a Cu-IV complex. Kinetic analysis of pulse radiolysis measurements coupled with DFT calculations point out that Cu-III(CO3)(n)(3-2n) complexes are the active intermediates in the electrolysis of Cu-II(CO3)(n)(2-2n) solution. The results enable the evaluation of E degrees[(Cu-III/II-(CO3)(n))(aq)] approximate to 1.42 V versus NHE at pH 8.4. This redox potential is in accord with the electrochemical report. As opposed to literature suggestions for water oxidation, the present results rule out single-electron transfer from Cu-III(CO3)(n)(3-2n) to yield hydroxyl radicals. Significant charge transfer from the coordinated carbonate to Cu-III results in the formation of C2O62- by means of a second-order reaction of Cu-III(CO3)(n)(3-2n). The results point out that carbonate stabilizes transition-metal cations at high oxidation states, not only as a good sigma donor, but also as a non-innocent ligand.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000427316700016	28921692

However, the rapid recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs limits the application of CdS in the field of catalytic hydrogen evolution. Here, we synthesize a CdS/MoS2 mixed-dimensional heterojunction by a simple hydrothermal method. In this process, CdS nanoparticles were supported on MoS2 nanosheets, where MoS2 acts as a loading platform and co-catalyst to improve the photocatalytic performance of CdS. A series of characterizations confirmed that CdS nanoparticles with a size of approximately 130 nm were uniformly grown on the surface of MoS2 nanosheets. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) tests show that this CdS/MoS2 mixed-dimensional heterojunction has enhanced photocatalysis hydrogen evolution activity, which is due to the CdS/MoS2 mixed-dimensional heterojunction can promote the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and positive synergy of MoS2 nanosheets as a co-catalyst. In addition, a new electrically assisted method is used to enhance the photocatalytic activity, and the photocatalytic performance of the CdS/MoS2 mixed-dimensional heterojunction is improved by nearly four times when a voltage of 0.6 V is applied. This phenomenon is attributed to the fact that providing an appropriate voltage can further promote the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and rapid carrier mobility, thereby effectively improve the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst. This work provides a good guiding significance for the design and construction of high-performance hydrogen evolution catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000675260600001

The catalytic activity of the complexes was enhanced by employing metal ions in higher oxidation states at the C- and N-bound sites, although only N-bound metal ions act as active sites. The dependence of the initial reaction rates for the hydrolysis on the initial concentration of p-NPP suggested that the rate determining step is the adsorption of p-NPP onto catalyst surfaces. The surface acidity of each complex estimated by the heat of pyridine desorption is strongly correlated with catalytic activity.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000448144600020

In this study, the effects of metal dopants on the physicochemical properties of metal-doped CN samples (Fe-, Cu-, Zn-, FeCu-, FeZn-, and CuZn-doped CN) and their catalytic activity in the photooxidation of acetic acid were investigated and discussed for their correlation, especially on their surface and bulk structures. The materials in the order of highest to lowest photocatalytic activity are FeZn_CN, FeCu_CN, Fe_CN, and Cu_CN (rates of CO2 evolution higher than for CN), followed by Zn_CN, CuZn_CN, and CN (rates of CO2 evolution lower than CN). Although Fe doping resulted in the extension of the light absorption range, incorporation of metals did not significantly alter the crystalline phase, morphology, and specific surface area of the CN materials. However, the extension of light absorption into the visible region on Fe doping did not provide a suitable explanation for the increase in photocatalytic efficiency. To further understand this issue, the materials were analyzed using two complementary techniques, reversed double-beam photoacoustic spectroscopy (RDB-PAS) and electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR). The FeZn_CN, with the highest electron trap density between 2.95 and 3.00 eV, afforded the highest rate of CO2 evolution from acetic acid photodecomposition. All Fe-incorporated CN materials and Cu-CN reported herein can be categorized as high activity catalysts according to the rates of CO2 evolution obtained, higher than 0.15 mu mol/min(-1), or >1.5 times higher than that of pristine CN. Results from this research are suggestive of a correlation between the rate of CO2 evolution via photocatalytic oxidation of acetic acid with the threshold number of free unpaired electrons in CN-based materials and high electron trap density (between 2.95 and 3.00 eV).									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2296-2646			WOS:000781323800001	35402383

However, the formation mechanism of free center dot OH radicals is not well understood. Herein, we present our experimental evidence that the surface Bronsted acid/base sites play a vital role in the photocatalytic formation of these free center dot OH radicals. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra show that the surface hydroxyl groups (Bronsted acid/base sites) on TiO2 is responsible for the high formation of free center dot OH radicals. Due to the lack of exposure of Bronsted acid/base sites, BiOCl is unfavorable for the formation of free center dot OH radicals. Inspired by these findings, we further constructed Bronsted acid/base sites by grafting phosphate ions onto the BiOCl surface, which greatly enhanced the formation of free center dot OH radicals. This work highlights the importance of surface Bronsted acid/base sites for the design of photocatalysts.									47	0	0	0	11	0	46			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000517665200018

Over the past decade, layered double hydroxides (LDHs), as the members in two-dimensional materials family, have attracted much attention due to their many advantages in photocatalysis, such as facile synthesis, low cost and powerful tunability of composition. In this review, we provide a synthetic overview of recent research advances of LDH-based photocatalysts, with the main discussion of the design strategies to improve their photocatalytic performance, including component control, defect engineering, hybridization, and topological transformation. Structure-performance correlations and tailor-made material synthesis strategies are elaborated to discuss how to realize high-performance LDH-based photocatalysts for three important reactions (i.e., water splitting, CO2 conversion, and N-2 reduction) to generate desirable solar fuels. Further, the remaining challenges and future perspectives of LDH-based photocatalysts are summed up, aiming to inspire brand new solutions for pushing forward the development of LDH-based photocatalysis.									55	7	0	0	2	0	56				2567-3165		WOS:000647981500001

In this work, on the basis of the concept "N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs)", we propose a carbon decorated graphitic-carbon nitride (C/g-C3N4) as novel metal-free NRR electrocatalyst by means of density functional theory (DFT) computations. Our results reveal that the introduced C atom in g-C3N4 surface can be regarded as NHCs and catalytic sites for activating N equivalent to N bond, and are stabilized by the g-C3N4 substrate due to sterically disfavored dimerization. Especially, this NHCs-based heterogeneous catalysis can efficiently reduce the activated N-2 molecule to NH3 with a low overpotential of 0.05 V via an enzymatic mechanism. Our work is the first report of NHCs-based electrocatalyst for N-2 fixation, thus opening an alternative avenue for advancing sustainable NH3 production.

S., Yu, S., and Withers, S. G. (2002) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 124, 4948-4949). The classical bell-shaped pH dependence of k(cat)/K-m indicates two ionizable groups in the active site with apparent pK(a) values of 3.05 and 6.66. Bronsted relationships of log k(cat), versus pKa and log(k(cat)/K-m) versus pK(a) for a series of aryl glucosides both show a linear monotonic dependence on leaving group pK(a) with low beta(1g) values of 0.32 and 0.33, respectively. The combination of these low beta(1g) values with large secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effects (k(H)/k(D) = 1.16similar to1.19) on the first step indicate a glycosylation step with substantial glycosidic bond cleavage and proton donation to the leaving group oxygen at the transition state. Developed oxocarbenium ion character of the transition state is also suggested by the potent inhibition afforded by acarbose and 1-deoxynojirimycin (K-i = 20 and 130 nM, respectively) and by the substantial rate reduction afforded by adjacent fluorine substitution. For only one substrate, 5-fluoro-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl fluoride, was the second elimination step shown to be rate-limiting. The large a-secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effect (k(H)/k(D) = 1.23) at C-1 and the small primary deuterium kinetic isotope effect (k(H)/k(D) = 1.92) at C-2 confirm an E2 mechanism with strong El character for this second step. This considerable structural and mechanistic similarity with retaining alpha-glucosidases is clear evidence for the evolution of an enzyme mechanism within the family.									58	0	0	0	43	0	58			0006-2960			WOS:000186439000039	14596624

The N-doped carbon (m-NC) and carbon nanotubes (m-NCNT) are obtained from ZIF-8 and ZIF-67, while the core-shell structure of ZIF-8@ZIF-67 produced with ZIF-8 seeds (m-NC@NCNT) is prepared by hydrothermal method. Chemical and optical evaluations of the catalysts are characterized using BET, FT-IR, XPS, XRD, Raman spectroscopy and SEM/STEM and they are used as the catalysts for redox reactions of vanadium ions and redox flow battery (VRFB) performance. In the utilization, m-NC@NCNT and m-NCNT are effective for improving VO2+/VO2+ redox reaction, although m-NC does not influence that. Even in VRFB tests using the catalysts, charge/discharge potential and energy efficiency (EE) of m-NC@NCNT and m-NCNT are highest, not to mention excellent EE resilience after undergoing tougher cycling condition. These results are due to the large graphitic-N portion of the two catalysts. Namely, electrons produced by the graphitic-N are delocalized, forming pi-conjugated system and vanadium-nitrogen transition state.

J	Yan, Su; Liao, Wenying; Zhong, Mengxiao; Li, Weimo; Wang, Ce; Pinna, Nicola; Chen, Wei; Lu, Xiaofeng								Partially oxidized ruthenium aerogel as highly active bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting in both alkaline and acidic media								APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL				307						121199	10.1016/j.apcatb.2022.121199				JUN 15 2022	2022	In this study, a general strategy is demonstrated to prepare a partially oxidized three-dimensional (3D) porous ruthenium (Ru) aerogel with distinct porous architecture and unique Ru/RuO2 interface. The optimized partially oxidized Ru aerogel catalyst exhibits an exceptional HER performance, which is even superior to the benchmark Pt/C catalyst, and an outstanding OER efficiency that is better than commercial RuO2 in both alkaline and acidic solutions. Furthermore, a two-electrode configuration based on the partially oxidized Ru aerogel as both anode and cathode for the overall water splitting exhibits an ultra-low working voltage of 1.467 V in 1 M KOH and 1.468 V in 0.5 M H2SO4 at 10 mA cm(-2) as well as a satisfactory long-term stability, outperforming the device composed of Pt/C||RuO2 catalysts. This research opens up a new avenue to develop highly efficient 3D porous aerogel electrocatalysts toward overall water splitting applications.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000788063500004		
J	Gluszewski, Wojciech					Gluszewski, Wojciech/0000-0002-0825-5580			GC investigation of post-irradiation oxidation phenomena on polypropylene								NUKLEONIKA				66	4			187	192		10.2478/nuka-2021-0027				DEC 2021	2021	The paper summarizes the results of research on gas products of polypropylene (PP) radiolysis. Particular attention was paid to the phenomena of post-radiation degradation of PP. The protective effect of selected aromatic compounds was investigated. The research was carried out both from the point of view of obtaining radiation-resistant PP varieties and the possibility of accelerating biodegradation phenomena, e.g., PP/cellulose composition. The phenomena of post-radiation chain oxidation of PP were investigated by gas chromatography (GC). The GC in the system used (packed column, thermal conductivity detector, argon - carrier gas) enables the determination of H-2, O-2, CO, and CH4 in one measurement. The samples were irradiated with electron beams (EBs) accelerated in accelerators: Elektronika 10/10 with a power of 10 kW and energy of 10 MeV and LAE 13/9 with a power of 9 kW and energy up to 13 MeV. In the tests, PP without stabilizing additives (obtained directly from the production line) and non-stabilized styrene were used. Radiolytic efficiency of hydrogen evolution allowed us to estimate the number of originally formed free radicals. The maintenance of the secondary oxidation processes was the loss of oxygen and the formation of oxidation products (CO, CH4). Attention is paid to the protective effect of aromatic compounds (polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), anthracene, fluoranthene, acenaphthene, pyrene, naphthalene) both at the stage of hydrogen atom separation and the secondary oxidation process. The examples of post-radiation oxidation of PP irradiated in cryogenic conditions (-196 degrees C) are presented. All used aromatic compounds showed a protective effect in PP radiolysis. We suppose that this phenomenon is responsible for the charge transfer along the polymer chain from the ionization spurs to the aromatic compound. The protective ranges of PS in PP radiolysis were estimated for the variously prepared PP/PS type compositions from 6 mers to 28 mers.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0029-5922	1508-5791		WOS:000723846100012

The confirmed relation between radius and incident flux depends on planetary mass intervals. In this study, we show that there is a single relation between radius and irradiated energy per gram per second (l(-)), for all mass intervals. There is an extra increase in radius of planets if l(-) is higher than 1100 times energy received by the Earth (l(circle plus)). This is likely due to dissociation of molecules. The tidal interaction as a heating mechanism is also considered and found that its maximum effect on the inflation of planets is about 15 per cent. We also compute age and heavy element abundances from the properties of host stars, given in the TEPCat catalogue (Southworth 2011). The metallicity given in the literature is as [Fe/H]. However, the most abundant element is oxygen, and there is a reverse relation between the observed abundances [Fe/H] and [O/Fe]. Therefore, we first compute [O/H] from [Fe/H] by using observed abundances, and then find heavy element abundance from [O/H]. We also develop a new method for age determination. Using the ages we find, we analyse variation of both radius and mass of the planets with respect to time, and estimate the initial mass of the planets from the relation we derive for the first time. According to our results, the highly irradiated gas giants lose 5 per cent of their mass in every 1 Gyr.									5	0	1	0	0	0	6			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000346963300084

Herein, we investigate the effect of proton activity on the open-circuit voltage (OCV) of a H2/H2 cell by individually controlling RHA and RHC at.30%. The OCV was thermodynamically estimated by applying the correlations of the RH and water uptake of a Nafion (R) membrane. The OCV experimentally increased with an increase in the humidity difference: the highest OCV of 77 mV was observed at RHA 30% and RHC 0%. The electro-osmotic coefficient (.) was calculated and found to be 0.73 at 5%-30% RHC and 30% RHA. The kinetic current (ik) of the oxygen-reduction reaction was measured by the rotating disk electrode method to verify the influence of proton activity (aH+). ik was described as ik. aH+-ss, with ss values of 0.29 and 0.45 for H2SO4 and CF3SO3H, respectively, at 0.9 V. The results demonstrate that for the dry operation of fuel cells, especially for heavyduty applications, proton activity effects within ionomers must be considered. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

Ni2P cocatalyst coupled 2D Ti3AlC2/TiO2 composite showed enhanced visible light absorption with promoted charge carrier separation. The activity of pristine Ti3AlC2 was obviously increased with the growth of TiO2 NPs and by exfoliating 2D MAX structure into multilayers. 2D Ti3AlC2/TiO2/Ni2P composite exhibited highest H-2 production of 13000 mmol g(-1) which was 1.29, 3.63 and 3.80 times more than the amount generated by TiO2/Ti3AlC2, TiO2/Ni2P and pristine TiO2, respectively. This enhanced activity was obviously due to good dispersion of TiO2/Ni2P over the Ti3AlC2 multilayers with boosted photoinduced charge carrier separation. Among the sacrificial reagents, glycerol-water mixture gave maximum H-2 production due to the presence of more alpha-hydrogen atoms. More importantly, highest CO2 was evolved using a glycerol-water mixture compared to methanol, confirming both photocatalytic water splitting and photoreforming reactions occur simultaneously. The reaction mechanism to understand the role of each component in the composite catalyst is further discussed. The findings of this work would be helpful in commercial applications of Ti3AlC2 MAX based structured catalysts for H-2 production and other sustainable energy systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

J	Schalck, Jonathan; Hereijgers, Jonas; Guffens, Wim; Breugelmans, Tom								The bromine mediated electrosynthesis of ethylene oxide from ethylene in continuous flow-through operation								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				446						136750	10.1016/j.cej.2022.136750				OCT 15 2022	2022	In this work a reactor setup for the bromine mediated, electrochemical oxidation of ethylene oxide from ethylene was developed. This novel design featured a flow-through configuration for the ethylene feed to accommodate the in situ synthesis of the 2-bromoethanol intermediate, creating a low pH at the anolyte to selectively target the bromine evolution. The cell was characterized via chronopotentiometry in 0.5 M KBr electrolyte, using a (i) Pt or (ii) IrO2 coated gas diffusion anodes paired with a Ni foam cathode. Within a current density of 65 to 156 mA/cm(2) for Pt and 65 to 133 mA/cm(2 )for IrO2, the productivity and selectivity of the reactor system was mapped. Throughout all conditions the reactor system retained a Faradaic efficiency of 80 to 90% towards ethylene oxide on both Pt and IrO2 coated gas diffusion anodes and exceeded an equivalent ethylene oxide production of 1 kg/ hour/m(2) at 156 mA/cm(2). Furthermore, the reactor upheld identical selectivity and productivity for 4.5 h without any signs of fading performance. Analysis of the gaseous product phase at this highest current condition showed no CO(2 )or O-2 side products, originating from hydrocarbon overoxidation or oxygen. Based on our findings, the bromine mediated pathway proves to be highly promising as the current best case of the chlorine mediated system achieves a 70% selectivity towards ethylene oxide. Additionally, the anodic catalyst stability was quantified by ICP-MS analysis and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis, which revealed IrO(2 )to be three orders of magnitude more dissolution resistant compared to Pt and confirm a homogeneous dispersion of the catalyst and binder material on the surface of the gas diffusion electrodes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000803692400001

Factors affecting the photoelectrochemical activity, such as the electrodeposition time, the ratio of the Bi-KI to benzoquinone-EtOH in the deposition bath, and the calcination temperature, have been investigated by using the Central Composite Design of Experiments. Pristine monoclinic scheelite BiVO4 photoanodes having a photocurrent density of 0.45 +/- 0.05 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs RHE have been obtained. It was shown that a high photocurrent density is generally dictated by the following physico-chemical properties: a higher crystallite size, optimal thickness and a porous morphology, which give rise to a low charge transfer resistance, low onset potential and a high donor density. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the depth profile XPS analysis performed in BiVO4 photoanodes made by electrodeposition technique, from which it was concluded that the surface V species exist as V4+ while the bulk V species are V5+. The V4+ induces a higher amount of surface oxygen vacancies, which was found to be beneficial for the photoactivity. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Pyrolysis experiments of six samples selected from the 19 coal samples were conducted to unravel the process and determine the upper thermal maturity limit for gas generation from humic coal. The variations of H/C atomic ratio of coal with increasing maturity appear to evolve through three stages which include a drastic decreasing phase before 2.0%R-o, a moderate decreasing phase from 2.0 to 6.0%R-o and a gradual decreasing phase above 6.0%R-o. The measurement results concerning the chemical structure of coal samples with increasing maturity indicate that most of the oxygen containing functional groups released was below 0.8%R-o. Aliphatic groups (especially methyl) were detected in samples with a maximum maturity of 4.46%R-o. The pyrolysis experiments for coal with different maturities using a gold tube system indicate that the main maturity intervals for CO2 and hydrocarbon gas generation from coal are below 0.8%R-o and 2.0%R-o, respectively. The pyrolysis experiment proved that only 4.37 ml/g TOC of hydrocarbon gas could be generated from the sample with a maturity of 5.32%R-o. Hence, the upper thermal maturity limit for gas generation from coal was determined to be about 5.0%R-o according to the variations of elemental composition, the chemical structure evolution and pyrolysis experiments for coal with different maturities.

All these uncertainties prevent an efficient management of the resource. In the context of the Aquitaine basin an original modelling approach suggests that geochemical data can be used to identify flow directions where geological and hydrogeological data are too scarce to provide sufficient information.In the Eocene sands aquifer, the major patterns of groundwater geochemistry suggest the presence of two distinct areas within the aquifer. In the north and the east, waters exhibit sodium bicarbonate or sodium sulphate facies, and moderate total dissolved solids related to high sulphate concentrations. In the south, waters are characterised by calcium bicarbonate facies and low total dissolved solids.Sulphur isotopic ratios provided key information on the origin of sulphur in solution (meteoric, gypsum dissolution, pyrite oxidation) and also on the intensity of the geochemical processes involved in the dissolution of minerals and the concentration evolution.A geochemical model was developed to analyse the processes generating the chemical composition of each sampled water. At the aquifer scale, four main geochemical processes-dissolution, redox, acid-base reaction, exchange-of varying intensity could explain most of the observed spatial variability in groundwater composition.Among several potential reaction schemes at each point, only one allowed to reproduce the independent variables (pH and C-13). The developed model was used to select the most probable water pathways at the aquifer scale. In this context, geochemistry clearly demonstrates the role played by subsurface structures on water flow velocities and residence time in their vicinity. In addition, the concentrations of several ions could only be justified by the aquitard-aquifer interactions. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we studied hydrotalcite-derived oxides or layered double oxides (LDOs), one of the most promising candidates for the inexpensive and effective CO2 adsorption in the intermediate temperature regime, using atomistic simulation techniques. We first constructed the equilibrium structure of an LDO and showed that this oxide was crystalline with an MgO-like structure. In particular, Mg ions configured with the FCC arrangement of oxygen ions and most of the Al3+ ions occupied octahedral positions by substituting Mg2+ ions and the rest (similar to 10%) occupied the tetrahedral positions. We then compared the CO2 physisorption properties of the amorphous and crystalline LDOs that respectively represented LDOs form at lower and higher limits of hydrotalcite calcination. Static and dynamic adsorption analyses revealed that the amorphous LDO had overall higher physisorption capacity. CO2 molecules exhibited a random arrangement in the adsorption layer of the amorphous LDO but an ordered arrangement in the case of crystalline LDO. As a result, CO2 molecules were able to adsorb to and to desorb from the amorphous LDO surface dynamically while the stable adsorption layer near the crystalline LDO surface acted like a contamination preventing other CO2 molecules to adsorb, thereby lowering the overall adsorption capacity of the crystalline LDO. Depending on the level of crystallinity, the physisorption behavior of the mixed oxide forming during the hydrotalcite calcination is expected to change between two structures studied here.									4	1	0	0	2	0	4			2212-9820	2212-9839		WOS:000509523900008		
J	He, Kai; Wang, Meng; Guo, Liejin								Novel-CdS-nanorod with stacking fault structures: Preparation and properties of visible-light-driven photocatalytic hydrogen production from water								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				279				747	756		10.1016/j.cej.2015.04.069				NOV 1 2015	2015	In the present study, CdS nanorod particles with stacking fault structures were hydrothermally synthesized through a dissolution-recrystallization approach in concentrated ammonia solvent, for the first time. Concentrated ammonia solution contained a larger number of hydroxyl ions and a fewer oxygen than that of water, which was beneficial for synthesizing more stable CdS nanorods without oxygen content. Comprehensive characteristics were performed to investigate the influence of stacking fault structures on the photocatalytic activity and stability of CdS nanorod particles. It was revealed that high density of stacking fault structures can be obviously observed within CdS nanorods, which was further proved by transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns, ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), fluorescence spectra, specific surface areas (BET) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). In the dissolution-recrystallization process, many cubic structural units tended to change to hexagonal phase in the CdS crystals, resulting in forming a large number of stacking fault structures. Because of the different band structures of cubic and hexagonal units, a type-II band structure can be formed at the stacking fault area, which significantly promoted the separation rate of photo-generated electrons and holes and then improved the visible-light-driven photocatalytic hydrogen production activity. CdS nanorod particles with stacking fault structures showed much higher photocatalytic activity and stability than that of CdS particles prepared by the conventional hydrothermal method using water as the hydrothermal solvent. This approach by using concentrated ammonia as the hydrothermal solvent opened new avenues in search of oxygen-free photocatalysts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The activation mechanism of these reactions is frequently linked to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) processes, which have not been fully validated experimentally due to the lack of suitable model materials. Here we show that the activation of anionic redox in cation-disordered rock-salt Li1.17Ti0.58Ni0.25O2 involves a long-lived intermediate Ni3+/4+ species, which can fully evolve to Ni2+ during relaxation. Combining electrochemical analysis and spectroscopic techniques, we quantitatively identified that the reduction of this Ni3+/4+ species goes through a dynamic LMCT process (Ni3+/4+-O2- -> Ni2+-On-). Our findings provide experimental validation of previous theoretical hypotheses and help to rationalize several peculiarities associated with anionic redox, such as cationic-anionic redox inversion and voltage hysteresis. This work also provides additional guidance for designing high-capacity electrodes by screening appropriate cationic species for mediating LMCT.Understanding reversible anionic redox reactions is key to designing high-energy-density cathodes for lithium-ion batteries. Anionic redox activation in cation-disordered rock-salt Li1.17Ti0.58Ni0.25O2 is shown to involve intermediate Ni3+/4+ species that can evolve to Ni2+ during relaxation.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000813711900001	35725928

This is especially compelling in combination with high-manganese steel (HMnS), as the mechanical properties can be influenced significantly by tailoring the chemistry-dependent stacking-fault energy (SFE). In DED, this can be used to design parts based on local deformation behavior. However, the increased affinity of HMnS to oxygen causes high amounts of oxide formation in the manufactured parts, ultimately deteriorating the mechanical properties due to premature cracking. To investigate the responsible mechanisms, two sets of processing parameters resulting in varying melt pool sizes were applied to produce X30Mn23 steel with up to 1 wt% in-situ alloyed Al. The melt pool was first modeled using a finite element method (FEM) approach and correlated with microstructure evolution (OM, SEM, EDS, EBSD, APT) and mechanical properties (tensile test). Interaction of the melt pool with the atmosphere and therefore oxide formation was successfully prevented by reducing the melt pool size, making the application of HMnS in DED feasible. The crack formation by oxides and its prevention are discussed in detail. Finally, the feasibility to manufacture HMnS with an in-situ alloying approach is critically evaluated.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0921-5093	1873-4936		WOS:000509621500106

Their ubiquitous environmental occurrence is primarily attributed to discharge from wastewater treatment plants due to incomplete removal by common biological wastewater treatment processes. Here, we assess a new strategy for promoting the degradation of six representative OMPs (i.e., sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, tylosin, atrazine, naproxen, and ibuprofen) by intentionally stimulating the production of microbial oxidoreductases to counter oxidative stress caused by oxygen perturbations. Mixed microbial cultures from a dairy farm wastewater were subjected to cyclic perturbations of dissolved oxygen (DO). A distance-based redundancy analysis was used to show that DO perturbations correlate with the abundance of Pseudomonadaceae and Rhodocyclaceae families, activities of peroxidases and cytochromes, and the degradation of OMPs. DO perturbation of 0.25 and 0.5 cycles/h led to most abundance of Pseudomonadaceae and Rhodocyclaceae families, showed higher activity of peroxidase and cytochrome, and gave largest removal of OMPs (removal of 92 +/- 3% for sulfamethoxazole, 84 +/- 3% for naproxen, 82 +/- 3% for ibuprofen, 66 +/- 2% for carbamazepine, 57 +/- 15% for tylosin, and 88 +/- 1% for atrazine).									9	0	0	0	8	0	9			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000482521600023	31356060

Mineralization occurs in Middle Eocene andesitic tuff and along four main vein systems trending northwest-southeast (Shurk, Mir-e-Khash, Shikasteh Sabz and Ghar-e-Kaftar veins). Microscopic studies reveal that the veins contain bornite, chalcocite, pyrite, tennantite together with minor sphalerite and chalcopyrite as hypogene minerals and chalcocite, digenite, covellite, valleriite, malachite, azurite, atacamite, hematite, and goethite as supergene minerals. The ore bodies are accompanied by narrow but intensely developed wall rock alterations of argillization, carbonatization and silicification. Copper content reaches 6.5, 2.4, 4.2 and 5% in Mir-e-Khash, Shikasteh Sabz, Ghar-e-Kaftar and Shurk, respectively. Microthermometric measurements of quartz- and calcite-hosted fluid inclusions indicate that the mineralization might be derived from a moderately saline hydrothermal fluid at temperatures between 175-316 degrees C. Calculated O-18 values of water in equilibrium with quartz and calcite for Khur veins suggest that the fluid might have had a magmatic source, but the O-18-depletion was developed through mixing with meteoric water. Copper deposition in Khur veins is believed to have been largely caused by mixing, although wall rock reactions may also have occurred. The Khur veins are classified as volcanic-subvolcanic hydrothermal-related vein deposits.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1000-9515	1755-6724		WOS:000438888600017

The g-C3N4 materials are having enormous assurance on photocatalytic applications but, pure g-C3N4 suffers from major drawbacks which includes poor disparity, low surface area as well as high recombination rate of photo generated electron hole pairs which greatly reduces its photocatalytic activity. Advantageously, high chemical and thermal stability give opportunity to amend g-C3N4 with other samples to conquer aforementioned limitations. Furthermore, it was proved that coupling with co-catalysts over pristine g-C3N4 could significantly develop its photocatalytic performance through synergistic effects of the incorporated semiconductors. This review gives an outline the recent progress in the improvement of g-C3N4 based ternary composite (CNT). Various methods utilized to prepare the g-C3N4 based ternary composite photocatalyst including with their corresponding examples were explained. Also, this review artide discussed the g-C3N4 based ternary composite photocatalytic applications in the O-2 evaluation, H-2 production and CO2 reduction and photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes in aqueous solution.

Herein, we describe the identification of a CDK gene from Apis cerana cerana, named AccCDK6. The full-length cDNA is 1,778 bp long, including an ORF of 1,380 bp that encodes a polypeptide of 459 amino acid residues. Multiple sequence alignment analysis showed that the predicted AccCDK6 sequence shares a high similarity with CDK6 genes of other species, and this protein may share an evolutionary predecessor with Drosophila CDK4. The expression patterns of the gene were also analysed, and the transcript was detected throughout the larval, pupal, and adult developmental stages. Furthermore, the expression level of the mRNA of the gene in adult workers was influenced by H2O2, ultraviolet (UV) light, temperature (42 degrees C), HgCl2, and pyriproxyfen. These results indicate that AccCDK6 responds to multiple environmental stresses and may also participate in intracellular reactions of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and development processes in honey-bees.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0939-5075	1865-7125		WOS:000308054900015	22888541

We simulate the experimental data of fluorescence transients in strong light through numerical integration, both in dark- and light-adapted plants. In the mathematical model used here we have considered for the first time the redox reactions at both the acceptor and the donor sides of photosystem II, and the non-photochemical quenching by the oxidised plastoquinone molecules from the lipid matrix of the thylakoid membrane. The model is based on assumptions established in the literature and also the values of input parameters used in simulations. The simulated fluorescence induction curves show the characteristic O --> J --> I --> P steps as in the experimental ones and, in specific conditions, the presence of a dip (D) between the I and P steps of the transient. Moreover, it has been shown here how typical patterns of fluorescence kinetics are influenced by the state of the sample by studying the basic effects of the influence of some parameters [i.e. the connectivity between different PS II units, initial Q(B):Q(B)(-) ratio and the ratio of the starting states of the oxygen evolving complex (S-1:S-2), number of plastoquinone molecules in the plastoquinone pool, initial redox state of the plastoquinone pool, and the rate of plastoquinol oxidation]. In this way the information can be drawn from the experimental curves relative to these parameters. (C) 1998 Academic Press.									140	6	11	0	140	2	156			0022-5193			WOS:000074909400012

NifB is an extremely unstable and oxygen sensitive protein that catalyzes a low-potential SAM-radical dependent reaction. The product of NifB activity is called NifB-co, a complex [8Fe-9S-C] cluster that serves as obligate intermediate in the biosyntheses of the active-site cofactors of all known nitrogenases. Here we study the diversity and phylogeny of naturally occurring NifB proteins, their protein architecture and the functions of the distinct NifB domains in order to understand what defines a catalytically active NifB. Focus is on NifB from the thermophile Chlorobium tepidum (two-domain architecture), the hyperthermophile Methanocaldococcus infernus (singledomain architecture) and the mesophile Klebsiella oxytoca (two-domain architecture), showing in silico characterization of their nitrogen fixation (nif) gene clusters, conserved NifB motifs, and functionality. C. tepidum and M. infernus NifB were able to complement an Azotobacter vinelandii (Delta nifB) mutant restoring the Nif(+) phenotype and thus demonstrating their functionality in vivo. In addition, purified C. tepidum NifB exhibited activity in the in vitro NifB-dependent nitrogenase reconstitution assay. Intriguingly, changing the two-domain K. oxytoca NifB to single-domain by removal of the C-terminal NifX-like extension resulted in higher in vivo nitrogenase activity, demonstrating that this domain is not required for nitrogen fixation in mesophiles.									12	0	0	0	10	0	12			1664-462X			WOS:000415040500002	29250084

The reaction involves a series of electron and proton transfers to achieve redox leveling, with intervening chemical transformations in a mesh scheme, and the entire molecular structure and motion of the catalyst 1 work together to drive the catalytic cycle for water oxidation. Two substrate water molecules can bind to 1 with simultaneous loss of one or two proton(s), which allows pH-dependent variability in the proportion of substrate-bound structures and following pathways for oxidative activation of the aqua/hydroxo ligands at low thermodynamic and kinetic costs. The resulting bis-oxo intermediates then undergo endothermic O-O radical coupling between two Ru(III)-O-center dot units in an anti-coplanar conformation leading to bridged mu-peroxo or mu-superoxo intermediates. The mu-superoxo species can liberate oxygen with the necessity for the preceding binding of a water molecule, which is possible only after four-electron oxidation is completed. The magnitude of catalytic current would be limited by the inherent sluggishness of the hinge-like bending motion of the bridged mu-superoxo complex that opens up the compact, hydrophobic active site of the catalyst and thereby allows water entry under dynamic conditions. On the basis of a newly proposed mechanism, we rationalize the experimentally observed behavior of electrode kinetics with respect to potential and discuss what causes a high overpotential for water oxidation by 1.									35	0	0	0	6	1	35			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000334902400007	24694023

The effects of the laser power densities and oxygen (O-2) partial pressure on the crystal orientations, microstructures, and textures of the LaPO4 films were investigated. Monoclinic LaPO4 monazite was grown at laser power densities of 62-96 W cm(-2) (deposition temperatures of 1075-1120 K) and an O-2 partial pressure of 257 Pa. The (11 (1) over bar)-oriented LaPO4 films with small pyramidal facets of less than 1 mu m in sizes and large platelets were grown at laser power densities lower than 85 W cm(-2). The preferred orientation of the monoclinic LaPO4 changed from (11 (1) over bar) to (10 (1) over bar) as the laser power density was increased to 95 W cm(-2), at which large platelets inclined from the substrate surface were formed. Deposition with a reduced O-2 partial pressure of 200 Pa induced the growth of highly (11 (1) over bar)-oriented LaPO4 films with small pyramidal facets, which comprised (001), (100), and (010) faceted planes. At a low O-2 partial pressure of 133 Pa, (100)-oriented LaPO4 films with platelet grains vertically grown from the substrate were formed. The deposition rates of the LaPO4 films were as high as 58.6 mu m h(-1).									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			0022-0248	1873-5002		WOS:000468597600008

Tomato DC3000								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES				19	3					696	10.3390/ijms19030696				MAR 2018	2018	Ethylene response factor (ERF) transcription factors play important roles in regulating immune responses in plants. In our study, we characterized a member of the ERF transcription factor family, VaERF20, from the Chinese wild Vitis genotype, V. amurensis Rupr "Shuangyou". Phylogenetic analysis indicated that VaERF20 belongs to group IXc of the ERF family, in which many members are known to contribute to fighting pathogen infection. Consistent with this, expression of VaERF20 was induced by treatment with the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea (B. cinerea) in "Shuangyou" and V vinifera "Red Globe". Arabidopsis thaliana plants over-expressing VaERF20 displayed enhanced resistance to B. cinerea and the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000. Patterns of pathogen-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation were entirely distinct in B. cinerea and PstDC3000 inoculated plants. Examples of both salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid/ethylene (JA/ET) responsive defense genes were up-regulated after B. cinerea and PstDC3000 inoculation of the VaERF20-overexpressing transgenic A. thaliana plants. Evidence of pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), callose accumulation and stomatal defense, together with increased expression of PTI genes, was also greater in the transgenic lines. These data indicate that VaERF20 participates in various signal transduction pathways and acts as an inducer of immune responses.									17	2	0	0	14	0	19				1422-0067		WOS:000428309800053	29494485

MoS2 is regarded as a promising candidate, but effective techniques are lacking to simultaneously settle the obstacles of limited site density and intrinsic activity, which still restrict its practical application. Herein, we address such challenges via activating MoS2 with Co,Fe co-doping and nanostructure engineering techniques through a template confined strategy. Using Prussian blue analogue (PBA) of Co-3[Fe(CH)(6)](2) nanocubes as self-sacrifice template not only guides the specific geometry of Co,Fe co-doped MoS2 (Co,Fe-MoS2) nanosheets assembled architecture, but also achieves the Co,Fe co-doping. Nanosheets assembled architecture supplies structural benefits of high surface area, short charge transfer path, and easily accessible active sites. The Co,Fe co-doping induces defects as additional catalytic sites and alters the electronic structure of active sites. When used as bifunctional catalysts for water electrolysis, Co,FeMoS2 shows excellent catalytic activity with a low cell potential of 1.49 Vat a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). In a two-electrode electrolyzer, only one single-cell AA battery could afford the sustainable overall water splitting. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Vander Meulen, KA; Hobson, A; Yocum, CF								Calcium depletion modifies the structure of the photosystem IIO2-evolving complex								BIOCHEMISTRY				41	3			958	966		10.1021/bi0109414				JAN 22 2002	2002	A 5 min exposure of photosystem 11 to a pH 3 citric acid solution is a simple method for selective removal of Ca2+ from the O-2-evolving complex. The resulting preparation retains the 23 and 17 kDa extrinsic polypeptides, but the activity of this material is only 10-20% of that of an untreated control sample. Biochemical characterization of citrate-treated photosystem 11 reveals that some reaction centers lose the extrinsic proteins during citrate treatment. Furthermore, a comparison of photosystem 11 preparations treated with citrate, or depleted of 23 and 17 kDa extrinsic polypeptides by high-salt treatment, shows that low concentrations of a small reductant, NH2OH, which has little effect on the activity of intact photosystem II, can reduce and inhibit the Mn cluster in both types of preparations. In contrast, a large reductant, hydroquinone, cannot access the majority Of O-2-evolving centers in citrate-treated preparations, while 23 and 17 kDa-depleted material is rapidly inactivated by the reductant. Incubation of the citrate-treated samples in high (similar to60 mM) concentrations of CaCl2 restores 50% of the lost activity; this Ca2+-reconstituted activity is chelator-insensitive, indicating that rebinding of Ca2+ restores the structural integrity of the O-2-evolving complex. A characterization of Ca2+ and Cl- affinities in steady-state activity assays shows that citrate-treated preparations exhibit a Cl- requirement similar to that of polypeptide-depleted photosystem II, while Ca2+ reactivation Of O-2 evolution appears to occur at two structurally distinct sites. One site exhibits a high Ca2+ affinity, similar to that found in polypeptide-depleted samples, but a second, lower-affinity site also exists, with a K-M that is approximately 10 times greater than that of the high-affinity site, which is associated with centers that retain the extrinsic polypeptides. These data indicate that citrate-induced Ca2+ depletion causes release of the 23 and 17 kDa extrinsic polypeptides from some photosystem II reaction centers, and also modifies the structure of the polypeptide-retaining O-2-evolving centers so that the Mn cluster is exposed to small, but not large, reductants. This change may be due to subtle modifications to the structure of the photosystem 11 extrinsic proteins that produces a new pathway between the solvent and the Mn cluster or, alternatively, to the opening of an existing channel in the intrinsic lumenal polypeptide domain, between the solvent and the Mn cluster, that is normally occluded by a bound Ca2+ atom.									23	1	0	0	20	0	28			0006-2960			WOS:000173374500030	11790119

FAKC-T undergoes relatively rapid decomposition of O-containing groups (O-I/O-II species) as carbonization temperature increases from 700 to 800 degrees C, which is closely related to mesopore evolution. Significant decrease in N content from FAKC-800 to FAKC-900, mainly due to the decomposition of N-6/N-5 species, results in remarkably increased micropore volume. FAKC-900 simultaneously possesses relatively high SSA and improved electrical conductivity based on its much higher sp(2)-carbon content. FAKC-800 exhibits larger specific capacitance at low current density than FAKC-900 and FAKC-700, which is attributed to the balance between effective SSA and heteroatom doping related to pseudocapacitance. FAKC-900 harvests an impressive rate capability of 82.1% from 0.25 to 10 A g(-1) in 3 M KOH electrolyte. The supercapacitor based on FAKC-900 electrode delivers an energy density of 38.1 W h Kg(-1) at 215.1 W kg(-1) in ionic liquid electrolyte. It was found that there exists a critical N content value in the range of 4.4 to 6.1 at.% when evaluating the specific capacitance and rate capability of FAKC-T electrodes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000739806400006

The results of in situ time-resolved X-ray diffraction (TR-XRD) show a strong interaction of methane with the CoOx-CeO2 systems at temperatures between 200 and 350 degrees C. The hydrogen produced by the dissociation of C H bonds in methane leads to a full reduction of Co oxide, Co3O4 -> CoO -> Co, and a partial reduction of ceria with the formation of some Ce3+. Upon the addition of CO2, a catalytic cycle for dry reforming of methane (DRM) was achieved on the CoOx-CeO2 powder catalysts at temperatures below 500 degrees C. A 10 wt % Co-CeO2 catalyst was found to possess the best catalytic activity among various cobalt loading catalysts, and it exhibits a desirable stability for the DRM with a accumulation. The phase transitions and the nature of active components in the catalyst were investigated under reaction conditions by in situ time-resolved XRD and ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS). These studies showed dynamic evolutions in the chemical composition of the catalysts under reaction conditions. CO2 attenuated the reducing effects of methane. Under optimum CO- and H-2-producing conditions, both XRD and AP-XPS indicated that the active phase involved a majority of metallic Co with a small amount of CoO, both supported on a partially reduced ceria (Ce3+/Ce4+). We identified the importance of dispersing Co, anchoring it onto the ceria surface sites, and then utilizing the redox properties of CeO2 for activating and then oxidatively converting methane while inhibiting coke formation. Furthermore, a synergistic effect between cobalt and ceria and likely the interfacial sitee are essential to successfully close the catalytic cycle.									60	0	0	0	0	0	60			2155-5435			WOS:000430154100099

Results suggested that the phase separation that had been reported in literature for Ir-Sn-O was through a typical spinodal decomposition mechanism. Ir0.534Sn0.466O2 was prepared by a thermal co-decomposition method at 320 and 450 degrees C. Quantitative phase analyze based on DFT, X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy confirmed the spinodal nature of the phase separation. The present fundamental study is an important reference for phase and microstructure design of Ir-Sn-O for various electrocatalysis applications. The DFT-assisted quantitative phase analysis has provided peer researchers with a novel reliable phase analysis approach for complex compounds. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zhang, Yanfei; Xu, Qijin; Wang, Chao; Jin, Zhenmin								Release of CO2 in Cold Subduction Zones by Hydrous Carbonatitic Liquids								GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS				48	7					e2021GL092550	10.1029/2021GL092550				APR 16 2021	2021	The release of CO2 from subducted slabs is an important process of the global carbon cycle. Previous studies have demonstrated that metamorphic reactions, carbonatitic melts, carbonate dissolutions, and hydrous carbonatitic liquids are effective CO2 recycling mechanisms in hot and warm thermal regimes, whereas the fate of subducted carbonates in cold subduction zones remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the phase relations of subducted ophicarbonate at pressures beyond sub-arc depths. The presence of complex quench textures indicates that hydrous carbonatitic liquids formed at temperatures as low as similar to 850 degrees C at depths of similar to 300-440 km, which corresponds to cold thermal regimes. Water released by the decomposition of dense hydrous magnesium silicate phases can substantially affect the stability of subducted carbonates, which facilitates the formation of hydrous carbonatitic liquids. This provides a mechanism for scavenging CO2 from cold slabs and may promote the formation of metasomatized domains in the deep mantle.Plain Language Summary More than half a gigaton of CO2 is transported into the Earth each year, contributing to the evolution of oxygen fugacity of the deep mantle. Recycling CO2 from subducted slabs to the atmosphere help balance the global long-term carbon cycle. Processes known as carbon removal from subducted slabs to arc volcanoes include metamorphic reaction, carbonatitic melt, hydrous carbonatitic liquid, and fluid dissolution, all of which are restricted to hot and warm subduction zones. In cold subduction zones, available studies show that carbon can be transported to great depths, rather than supply arc volcanoes. Here, we conduct high-pressure experiments to investigate the phase transitions of ophicarbonate, important water- and carbon-bearing rock in subduction zones. We find hydrous carbonatitic liquids at temperatures as low as similar to 900 degrees C at 5-10 GPa, and similar to 850 degrees C at 15 GPa, which correspond to typical cold subduction zones. We suggest that water released by the decomposition of hydrous minerals strongly affects the stability of carbonates, facilitating the formation of hydrous carbonatitic liquids. Therefore, dehydration-induced carbonatitic liquid may provide a mechanism for the removal of CO2 from subducted slabs at great depths in cold thermal regimes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0094-8276	1944-8007		WOS:000641974600047

The microstructures of the coatings were analyzed; the high temperature wear and oxidation properties of the coatings were investigated and compared with Ti6Al4V. Ti3Al and TiB particles were in situ formed through the reaction between Ti and AlB2. The reinforcements exhibited some crystallographic orientation relationships with alpha-Ti matrix, and a semi-coherent interface (Ti3Al) or a coherent interface (TiB) was obtained. The weight gain of the coating under each combination of temperature and time condition was 20 to 30 pct of the value of Ti6Al4V under the same experimental parameters. A denser and well-bonded TiO2 + Al2O3 layer was formed, effectively hindering the oxygen diffusion compared with the TiO2 layer on Ti6Al4V. EBSD result showed that the Al2O3 mainly assembled into clusters and located close to the interface while the outer area of the oxidation layer was mainly TiO2. The friction coefficients and wear losses of the coatings were lower than those of the substrates at 300 degrees C to 750 degrees C. The oxidation was a crucial factor affecting the wear performance at high temperatures. The protective effect of the TiO2 + Al2O3 layer and the formation of transfer films on the worn surface contributed to the improved wear resistance of the coating.

This includes the identification of the redox states that do and do not participate in catalysis and very significant axial ligand effects on the activity of the doubly oxidized complex. Specifics deduced for the electrocatalysis under homogeneous conditions include the following: the one-electron oxidation of the cobalt(III) corrole is completely unaffected by reaction conditions; catalysis coincides with the second oxidation event; two catalytic waves develop in the presence of OH-, and the one at lower overpotential is dominant under more basic conditions. Comparative spectroelectrochemical measurements performed for Co(tpfc) and Al(tpfc), the analogous corrole chelated by the nonredox active aluminum, revealed that the second oxidation process of Co(tpfc) is much more significantly metal-centered than the first one. EPR studies revealed that shift from fully corrole-centered to partially metal centered in the singly oxidized complex [Co(tpfc)](+) is achievable with fluoride as axial ligand. The analogous experiment, but with hydroxide instead of fluoride, could not be performed because of a surprising phenomenon: formation of a cobalt superoxide complex that is actually relevant to oxygen reduction rather than to water oxidation. Nevertheless, fluoride and hydroxide induce very similar effects in terms of the appearance of two catalytic waves, lowering of onset potentials, and increasing the catalytic activity. The main conclusions from the accumulated data are that the apparent pH effect is actually due to hydroxide binding to the cobalt center and that pi-donating axial ligands play pivotal and beneficial roles regarding the main factors that are important for facilitating the oxidation of water.									37	1	0	0	2	0	37			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000419419700053	29256608	
J	Summers, DP								Ammonia formation by the reduction of nitrite/nitrate by FeS: Ammonia formation under acidic conditions								ORIGINS OF LIFE AND EVOLUTION OF THE BIOSPHERE				35	4			299	312		10.1007/s11084-005-2040-1				AUG 2005	2005	One issue for the origin of life under a non-reducing atmosphere is the availability of the reduced nitrogen necessary for amino acids, nucleic acids, etc. One possible source of this nitrogen is the formation of ammonia from the reduction of nitrates and nitrites produced by the shock heating of the atmosphere and subsequent chemistry. Ferrous ions will reduce these species to ammonium, but not under acidic conditions. We wish to report results on the reduction of nitrite and nitrate by another source of iron (II), ferrous sulfide, FeS. FeS reduces nitrite to ammonia at lower pHs than the corresponding reduction by aqueous Fe+2 stop. The reduction follows a first order decay, in nitrite concentration, with a half-life of about 150 min (room temperature, CO2, pH 6.25). The highest product yield of ammonia measured was 53%. Under CO2, the product yield decreases from pH 5.0 to pH 6.9. The increasing concentration of bicarbonate, at higher pH, interferes with the reaction. Comparing experiments under N-2 CO2 shows the interference of bicarbonate. The reaction proceeds well in the presence of such species as chloride, sulfate, and phosphate, though the yield drops significantly with phosphate. FeS also reduces nitrate and, unlike with Fe+2 stop, the reduction shows more reproducibility. Again, the product yield decreases with increasing pH, from 7% at pH 4.7 to 0% at pH 6.9. It appears that nitrate is much more sensitive to the presence of added species, perhaps not competing as well for binding sites on the FeS surface. This may be the cause of the lack of reproducibility of nitrate reduction by Fe+2 stop (which also can be sensitive to binding by certain species).									45	2	0	0	26	0	47			0169-6149			WOS:000232613900002	16228644

In our research, we used graphite irradiated by gamma-rays to successfully prepare GQDs with ultrafine particle size, narrow size distribution and high quantum yields through solvothermal method. Vacancy defects, pentagon-heptagon defects and interstitial defects were introduced to graphite structure after irradiation, which caused the abundance and concentrated distribution of defects. The defects generated by irradiation could damage the lattice structure of graphite to make it easy for introduction of C-O-C inside graphite sheets. The oxygen-containing functional groups in graphene oxide (GO) increased and centrally distributed after irradiation in graphite, especially for C-O-C group, which were beneficial for cutting of GO and grafting of functional groups in GQDs. Therefore, average size of GQDs was successfully reduced to 1.43 nm and concentrated to 0.6-2.4 nm. After irradiation in graphite, the content of carbonyl and C-N in GQDs had a promotion, which suppressed non-radiative recombination and upgraded the quantum yields to 13.9%.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0953-8984	1361-648X		WOS:000711188800001	34134104

Here, we demonstrate that trace water can drastically boost high-efficiency photocatalytic production of H2O2 with a record-high concentration of 113 mmol L-1 using alkali-assisted C3N4 as photocatalyst in water/alcohol mixture solvents. By electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurement, the radical species generated during the photocatalytic process of H2O2 are identified. We propose alcohol is used to provide and stabilize center dot OOH radicals through hydrogen bond, while trace water could trigger photocatalytic production of H2O2 via providing and transferring indispensable free protons to completely consume center dot OOH radicals, which breaks the reaction balance of center dot OOH radical generation from alcohol. Thus center dot OOH radicals could be supplied by alcohol continuously to serve as a reservoir for high-efficiency production of H2O2. These results pave the way towards photocatalytic method on semiconductor catalysts as an outstanding approach for production of hydrogen peroxide.

J	Kim, Donghyung; Yong, Kijung								Boron doping induced charge transfer switching of a C3N4/ZnO photocatalyst from Z-scheme to type II to enhance photocatalytic hydrogen production								APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL				282						119538	10.1016/j.apcatb.2020.119538				MAR 2021	2021	Heterojunction photocatalysts are very promising for solar hydrogen production due to their high efficiency in photo-driven charge generation and separation. A C3N4/ZnO heterostructure nanocomposite harvests a wide range of solar light from the UV and visible regions and retains a high redox potential due to its Z-scheme band structure. However, since both C3N4 and ZnO have sufficiently high conduction band energies to drive hydrogen photoreduction, a type II heterojunction is more beneficial for enhancing the hydrogen production efficiency in the current system. In this study, we first demonstrated the charge transfer mechanism switching from the Z-scheme to type II by simple boron (B) doping of C3N4/ZnO. The doping of C3N4 with low-electronegativity boron increases its Fermi level by 0.4 V, making it even higher than that of ZnO. As a result, the Fermi level alignment of B-doped C3N4 with ZnO causes a reversed band bending direction at the C3N4/ZnO junction. The resultant charge transfer switching from the Z-scheme (C3N4/ZnO) to type II (B-doped C3N4/ZnO) was confirmed by UPS and ESR analysis. Type II B-doped C3N4/ZnO shows a stable, drastic increase in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate, approximately 2.9 times higher than that of undoped C3N4/ZnO. The decreased bandgap energy of B-doped C3N4/ZnO also contributes to an additional improvement in efficiency through enhanced light harvesting. Our work presents a simple but effective strategy to design highly capable heterojunction photocatalysts via charge transfer switching with a doping method.									144	3	0	0	17	1	145			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000591696500005

Among all the atom catalysts, atomically dispersed heteronuclear dual-atom catalysts (HDACs), which are featured with asymmetric active sites, have recently opened new pathways in the field of advancing atomic catalysis. In this review, the up-to-date investigations on heteronuclear dual-atom catalysts together with the last advances on their theoretical predictions and experimental constructions are summarized. Furthermore, the current experimental synthetic strategies and accessible characterization techniques for these kinds of atomic catalysts, are also discussed. Finally, the crucial challenges in both theoretical and experimental aspects, as well as the future prospects of HDACs for energy-related applications are provided. It is believed that this review will inspire the rational design and synthesis of the new generation of highly effective HDACs.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000729390800001	34897990

In this study, we employed Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) as a model to assess the neuronal damage caused by mSiNPs at the predicted environmentally relevant concentrations. After nematodes were acute and prolonged exposed to mSiNPs at concentrations over 300 mu g/L, locomotion degeneration, shrinking behavior, and abnormal foraging behavior were observed, which were associated with the deficits in the development of GABAergic neurons, including D-type and RME motor neurons. Furthermore, the oxidative stress evidenced by excessive ROS generation might contribute to the mechanism of mSiNPs damaging neurons. Although the neurotoxicity of mSiNPs was weaker than (nonmesoporous) SiNPs, it is still necessary for researchers to pay attention to the adverse effects caused by mSiNPs in the environmental animals, especially with the rapid increase in mSiNPs application. Considering the conserved property of GABAergic neurons during evolution, these findings will shed light on our understanding of the potential eco-risks of NPs to the nervous system of other animal models.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0893-228X	1520-5010		WOS:000553242400017	32510209

F, G.J. Norga, H.E. Maes, and G. Maes, J. Mater. Res.. 16, 2499 (2001)]. The crystallinity of the intermediate pyrochlore phase, which forms during pyrolysis, was found to strongly depend oil pyrolysis conditions. Specifically, pyrolysis for 10 s at 350 degreesC was seen to result in conversion of the film to a well-crystallized, oxygen-deficient pyrochlore phase with the fluorite crystal structure (disordered pyrochlore). We speculate that formation of the metastable fluorite phase is favored by the reduced oxygen partial pressure, caused by burnoff of residual acetates. Longer pyrolysis times and/or higher pyrolysis temperatures result in a quasi-amorphous intermediate phase. The presence of the well-crystallized fluorite phase in the pyrolyzed film is seen to result in (111)-oriented films after crystallization, while pyrolyzed films consisting of a quasi-amorphous intermediate phase turn out (100) or mixed (100)/(111) oriented after crystallization. An explanation for the observed orientation effects, on the basis of the different surface energetics of fluorite versus perovskite structure oxides, is proposed.									16	0	1	0	0	0	17			0884-2914			WOS:000182586600030

Two are created by water filtration of fully oxidized graphene sheets, although one is later intercalated with dodecylamine. The third is created by reducing graphene oxide with hydrazine hydrate. The spectroscopic fingerprints of the aligned epoxide functional groups that unzip the carbon basal plane are found. This unzipping appears to be a result of aging, and the extent to which the basal plane is unzipped can be controlled via the preparation method. In particular, reduction with hydrazine enhances line defect formation, whereas intercalation inhibits the process.The hydroxyl functional group also has a tendency to gather in zones of dense oxidation on the carbon basal plane, a predilection that is not shared by the other prominent functional group species. Finally, the non-functionalized carbon sites exhibit very similar bonding despite the increase in the sp2/sp3 ratio, confirming that reduction alone is insufficient for producing pristine graphene from graphene oxide. These results are obtained by directly probing the electronic structure of the graphene oxide samples via X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy (XANES) and resonant X-ray emission spectroscopy (RXES). This work has important significance for the development of graphene oxide as a band gap-engineered electronic material, as preparation methodology strongly affects not only the initial condition of the sample, but how the electronic structure evolves over time.									68	0	0	0	7	0	68			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000308883100025

A decrease was observed in the electrochemically active area of the electrode as the cation size increases. The oxidation potential of a series of organic solvents tested showed a straight relationship with Gutmann's donor number: the higher the GDN the more easily is the solvent oxidized. Oxidation of isosafrole, ISF, was used as a probe reaction to examine the influence of the supporting electrolyte cation size and the composition of the organic solvents on the electrocatalytic activity of the electrodes. The global catalytic activity for ISF oxidation is independent of the size of the supporting electrolyte cation and of the electrode material.

While the requirements of successful electrocatalysts include a high number density of catalytically active sites, high surface-to-volume ratio, inherently high catalytic activity, and robustness of the catalyst surface structure under harsh operating conditions, it is extremely difficult to synthesize nanocatalysts that could possess all these structural characteristics. Nanotemplate-mediated synthesis, namely, the coating or filling of a template with a desired material phase followed by the removal of the template, has captured the interest of researchers because of the ease of creating hollow-structured nanocatalysts with a high surface to volume ratio. Recent studies, however, have revealed that nanotemplates could be more than just passive supports because they greatly affect catalytic performance by creating an unusual synergy between the substrate and catalyst and by providing dopants to the actual catalyst phase owing to their reactive nature. In this review, we discuss the most notable recent advances in the nanotemplate-based synthesis of electrocatalysts as well as the unusual effects of nanotemplates on the performance of nanocatalysts. We also provide an outlook for this fledgling field so that future research efforts could be focused on the development of practically useful electrocatalysts that could shape the future of energy technologies.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000502779900002	31651011

Integrating dissimilar metals into a single nanoparticle (NP) offers a unique avenue for customizing catalytic activity and maximizing surface area. Alloys containing five or more equimolar components with a disordered, amorphous microstructure, referred to as High-Entropy Metallic Glasses (HEMGs), provide tunable catalytic performance based on the individual properties of incorporated metals. Here, we present a generalized strategy to electrosynthesize HEMG-NPs with up to eight equimolar components by confining multiple metal salt precursors to water nanodroplets emulsified in dichloroethane. Upon collision with an electrode, alloy NPs are electrodeposited into a disordered microstructure, where dissimilar metal atoms are proximally arranged. We also demonstrate precise control over metal stoichiometry by tuning the concentration of metal salt dissolved in the nanodroplet. The application of HEMG-NPs to energy conversion is highlighted with electrocatalytic water splitting on CoFeLaNiPt HEMG-NPs.									157	11	0	0	9	0	162				2041-1723		WOS:000471586800006	31201304

It was found that there is an increasing trend of oxidation in these intermetallics as the Au content increases. AlAu4 shows the greatest tendency to oxidize with two extra peaks appearing on the Au 4f spectra after long exposure time in air. The surface of AlAu2, although fully oxidized, reveals only one Au 4f peak shift as depth increases. Al2Au was the least oxidizing compound, and the oxide is thin. The binding energies of Al 2p and An 4f peaks were measured and reported. The Au atoms trapped in the oxide layers exhibit higher binding energy emissions compared to those of elemental All.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:000255543800025

Crystallization is sought in many application fields since it allows enhancing or even promoting properties of catalysis, energy storage and photoelectric properties. However, the crystallization process of nanostructured COFs remains to be challenging. Synthetic approaches to establish nucleation and elongation growth of COFs for controlling crystallization have drawn substantial amount of attentions. Nanostructured COFs have exhibited significant advantages when applied in (electro)photocatalysis and energy storage devices as well. In this review, recent progress in precisely design strategy of fabricating various nanostructured COFs and their applications as (electro)photocatalyzer and energy storage devices are summarized. After a brief introduction of the design principles, composition and interior architecture, the morphology of nanostructured COFs including porous and mesoporous stacked-layer structure, nanosheet structure, nanorod structure, ordered stripe arrays and various nanocomposites are thoroughly described. Reactions dedicated to crystallization process for two-dimensional (2D) COFs are discussed further. Then, the applications of nanostructured COFs as (electro)photocatalysis and energy storage devices are demonstrated. Finally, the potential advantages and challenges for the synthetic technology of nanostructured COFs materials are particularly discussed. Personal insights into the challenges and opportunities on pursuing topologies as hollow structures, dense spheres, yolk-shell structures were raised to broaden the applications.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000656101400002

All other factors being equal, magnetic 2D-MnOx structures carried out the chemical water oxidation reaction with Ce4+ at a higher efficiency than their 1D-, 3D- and non-magnetic counterparts. Ca-birnessite, when supported on a ferrite core, produced the highest amount of O-2 [3900 mmol (O-2) per mot (Mn) per hl normalized per mot of manganese in the catalysts.

J	VILLA, IM; PUXEDDU, M								GEOCHRONOLOGY OF THE LARDERELLO GEOTHERMAL-FIELD - NEW DATA AND THE CLOSURE TEMPERATURE ISSUE								CONTRIBUTIONS TO MINERALOGY AND PETROLOGY				115	4			415	426		10.1007/BF00320975				FEB 1994	1994	The Larderello geothermal field is generally accepted to have been produced by a granite intrusion at 4-9 km depth. Hydrothermal parageneses and fluid inclusions always formed at temperatures greater than or equal to the current ones which implies that the field has always undergone a roughly monotonic cooling history (fluctuations < 40 K) since intrusion of the granite at 4 Ma. The heat required to maintain the thermal anomaly over such a long period is supplied by a seismically anomalous body of almost-equal-to 32000 km3 rooted in the mantle. Borehole minerals from Larderello are thus a unique well-calibrated natural example of thermally induced Ar and Sr loss under geological conditions and time spans. The observations (biotites retain Ar above 450-degrees-C) agree well with other, albeit less precise, geological determinations, but contrast with laboratory determinations of diffusivity from the literature. We therefore performed a hydrothermal experiment on two Larderello biotites and derived a diffusivity D(Lab)(370-degrees-C) = 5.3 . 10(-18) cm2s-1, in agreement with published estimates of diffusivity in annite. From D(Lab) and the rejuvenation of the K/Ar ages we calculate maximum survival times at the present in-hole temperatures. They trend smoothly over almost two orders of magnitude from 352 ka to 5.3 ka, anticorrelating with depth: laboratory diffusivities are inconsistent not only with geological facts, but also among themselves. From the geologically constrained lifetime of the thermal anomaly we derive a diffusivity D(G)(370-degrees-C) = 3.81 . 10(-21) cm2s-1, 3 +/- 1 orders of magnitude lower than D(Lab). The cause of these discrepancies must be sought among various laboratory artefacts: overstepping of a critical temperature T; enhanced diffusivities in ''wet'' experiments; presence of fast pathway (dislocation and pipe) diffusion, and of dissolution/reprecipitation reactions, which we imaged by scanning electron microscopy. These phenomena are minor in geological settings: in the absence of mineral transformation reactions, complete or near-complete resetting is achieved only by volume diffusion. Therefore, laboratory determinations will necessarily result in apparent diffusivities that are too high compared to those actually effecting the resetting of natural geochronometers.									102	0	1	0	2	0	103			0010-7999			WOS:A1994MZ04600004

Despite prevalent investigations, many challenges still hindered an efficient energy conversion, such as enhancing the reaction efficiency in visible light. Thus controlling the photoelectrode materials is an essential step in designing new materials for water splitting. CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) has received great attention as photocatalyst under solar light due to its combined band gap as result of the presence in its structure of TiO2 active in UV light and CuO active under visible light. In this work, a cubic CCTO with different amount of exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride has been synthesized. The produced materials were fully characterized. Physico-chemical characterizations demonstrate that bore and nitrogen co-doped CCTO causes an increase in grain boundaries thickness, and thus leads to shift peaks in XRD and Raman spectra. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy showed a decrease of the bang gap value after adding boron nitride nanosheets into CCTO. The electrochemical performance and the resistivity of the obtained materials were performed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in dark and under visible light exposition. The onset potential recorded for CCTO with 3% of boron nitride nanosheets (Eg = 2.9), is around 0.5 V and the current generation is 16 times more than pure phase of CCTO. This work shows that CCTO with 3% of boron nitride nanosheets can be considered as an active photoelectrocatalyst under visible light irradiation for water splitting. Hydrogen production measurements show that the rate of H-2 production reached arround 8.1 mu mol/h under visible light after adding 3% of BN nanosheets to CCTO which presents 16 times increase in comparison with pure CCTO.									26	2	0	0	2	0	26			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000519528800067

The modification with an appropriate amount of cobalt phosphate could greatly enhance the activity for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation of nc-TiO2, superior to the modification only with the phosphate anions. It is clearly demonstrated that the enhanced activity after cobalt phosphate modification is attributed to the roles of cobalt(II) ions linked by phosphate groups with the surfaces of nc-TiO2 mainly by means of the surface photovoltage responses in N-2 atmosphere. It is suggested that the linked cobalt(II) ions could capture photogenerated holes effectively to produce high-valence cobalt ions, further inducing oxidation reactions with water molecules to rereturn to cobalt(II) ions. This work is useful to explore feasible routes to improve the performance of oxide-based semiconductors for PEC water splitting to produce clean H-2 energy.									54	1	0	0	4	0	54			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000319551200011	23618060	
J	Hajsadeghi, Saeid; Mirmohammadi, Mirsaleh; Asghari, Omid								Evidence of gas plume model in porphyry copper deposits based on anatomy, fluid inclusions and H-O isotopes: Insight from Kahang deposit, Iran								ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS				139						104517	10.1016/j.oregeorev.2021.104517		OCT 2021		DEC 2021	2021	The Kahang deposit (100 Mt at 0.6% Cu) is one of the important porphyry copper deposits in the central part of Urumieh-Dokhtar Magmatic Arc (UDMA), Iran. The mineralization occurs as chalcopyrite and molybdenite in quartz and anhydrite -bearing veinlets or breccias and is closely associated with sericitic and phyllic alterations. Through comprehensive studies of the deposit's anatomy, some previously overlooked evidence raised new questions about the ore-forming process in the Kahang deposit. The coexistence of sulfate and sulfide minerals as veinlets and breccias, pore space breccias, could not be justified solely based on a previously introduced concept (i.e., mixing high temperature-high salinity magmatic water with low temperature-low salinity meteoric water). Fluid inclusions were examined in quartz veinlets of the A1, A2, and B types, anhydrite veinlets, and sphalerite of the L type veinlets. There are three types of fluid inclusions: liquid-rich (L-type), vapor-rich (V-type), and hypersaline (H-type). According to microthermometry of fluid inclusions, the fluids associated with anhydrite veinlets have relatively high temperatures (390-495 degrees C, mean = 455 degrees C) and low salinities (12.8-20.9 wt% NaCl equiv.) On the contrary, temperatures below 400 degrees C justified the coexistence of sulfate and sulfide minerals. The low solubility of anhydrite in high-temperature waters, on the other hand, demonstrates the gas-solid reaction of SO2 (g) and plagioclase at such temperatures, as evidenced by fluid inclusions. Additionally, the fluid inclusions in quartz veinlets generated temperatures (290 to >600 degrees C) higher than those in the majority of other porphyry copper deposits. H-O isotopes indicated that magmatic fluids dominated, and meteoric waters played an insignificant role. These findings and observations supported the formation of the Kahang porphyry copper deposit as a result of a gas plume and the reactions of gas species with plagioclase to form anhydrite and sulfide minerals, as well as the formation of sericitic alteration in the host rock as a novel scenario.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-1368	1872-7360		WOS:000710497800001

This infiltration resulted in the formation of veins containing both two-phase and halite-bearing aqueous fluid inclusions, sometimes with bitumen and hydrocarbon inclusions.Microthermometric results demonstrate a very wide range of salinities of aqueous fluids preserved in these veins, ranging from c. 0 to 40 wt% NaCl equivalent. The range in homogenization temperatures is also very large (99-322degreesC for the entire dataset) and shows little or no correlation with salinity.A combination of aqueous fluid microthermometry, halogen geochemistry and oxygen isotope studies suggest that fluids from a range of separate aquifers were responsible for the quartz growth, but all have chemistries comparable to sedimentary formation waters. The bulk of the quartz grew from relatively low delta(18)O fluids derived directly from the basin or equilibrated in the upper part of the basement (T< 200degreesC). Nevertheless, some fluids acquired higher salinities due to deep wall-rock hydration reactions leading to salt saturation at high temperatures (>300degreesC).The range in fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures and densities, combined with estimates of the ambient temperature of the basement rocks suggests that at different times veins acted as conduits for influx of both hotter and colder fluids, as well as experiencing fluctuations in fluid pressure. This is interpreted to reflect episodic flow linked to seismicity, with hotter dry basement rocks acting as a sink for cooler fluids from the overlying basin, while detailed flow paths reflected local effects of opening and closing of individual fractures as well as reaction with wall rocks. Thermal considerations suggest that the duration of some flow events was very short, possibly in the order of days. As a result of the complex pattern of fracturing and flow in the Modum basement, it was possible for shallow fluids to penetrate basement rocks at significantly higher temperatures, and this demonstrates the potential for hydrolytic weakening of continental crust by sedimentary fluids.									40	0	0	0	2	0	40			1468-8115			WOS:000180878100003

However, the shape-controlled synthesis of high-performance Pt-based nanocatalysts remains a forbidden challenge. We herein demonstrate a versatile approach for realizing the systemically controlled syntheses of bimetallic PtCu nanocrystals (NCs) from concave nanocubes (CNCs), to excavated nanocubes, to tripods via simply switching the amount of glycine (reducing agent). These PtCu nanostructures supply a desirable platform for carrying out the structure-dependent electrocatalytic studies in the liquid fuel electro-oxidation. Impressively, all of the PtCu NCs show high activity and outstanding durability for alcohol oxidation. In particular, the PtCu CNCs display unprecedent high activity toward MOR and EOR, which are found to be 2041.1 and 5760.9 mA mg(-1) in mass activity, 7.9- and 11.5-folds greater than the commercial Pt/C catalysts, respectively, showing a promising class of electrocatalysts for fuel cells. This work sheds great promise for optimizing the electrochemical catalysis by precisely modulating the structure of catalysts.									22	3	0	0	0	0	23			0743-7463			WOS:000438653800004	29916718

The core idea is to create a reactivity weight function peaking at the Fermi level, thereby determining a weighted summation of the density of states of a solid surface. When such a weight function is defined as the derivative of the Fermi-Dirac distribution function at a certain non-zero temperature, the resulting property is the finite-temperature chemical softness, termed Fermi softness (S-F), which turns out to be an accurate descriptor of the surface reactivity. The spatial image of SF maps the reactive domain of a heterogeneous surface and even portrays morphological details of the reactive sites. SF analyses reveal that the reactive zones on a Pt3Y(111) surface are the platinum sites rather than the seemingly active yttrium sites, and the reactivity of the S-dimer edge of MoS2 is spatially anisotropic. Our finding is of fundamental and technological significance to heterogeneous catalysis and industrial processes demanding rational design of solid catalysts.									64	3	0	0	7	0	65			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000377918400018	27072349

The optimal synthetic conditions were systematically investigated by an orthogonal test method and single factor of hydrothermal time to evaluate the influence of sample morphology and electrochemical performance. The synthesis conditions for preparing NiCo2O4 with different morphologies were systematically studied. In the single factor experiment, when the hydrothermal time is 6, 12, 16, and 24 hours, the corresponding morphologies are urchin-like (NCO-U), flower-like (NCO-F), sheet-like (NCO-S), and block-like (NCO-B), respectively. The element content of the prepared materials under different synthesis conditions was tested by an inductive-coupled plasma emission spectrometer, and an interesting phenomenon was found. As the reaction time increases, the content of Ni+ gradually decreases and the content of Co+ gradually increases, which may be one of the factors that affect the morphology and electrochemical performance of the material. The specific capacitances of NCO-U, NCO-F, NCO-S, and NCO-B are calculated to be 914.3, 392.2, 313.3, and 277.4 F g(-1), respectively, at a current density of 1 A g(-1). Benefiting from the large specific surface area and rich oxygen vacancy, the as-fabricated urchin-like NiCo2O4 as electrode materials for supercapacitor demonstrates its promising application potential for supercapacitors.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000682959300001

By virtue of the excellent electrical conductivity and good mechanical strength of the NixSey nanowire core, abundant exposed active sites of the NiFe LDH nanosheet shell, and the open structure of the hierarchical nanoarrays, the integrated core-shell NixSey-NiFe LDH@NF electrode exhibited outstanding catalytic performance for HMF and FUR oxidation by obtaining considerable yields of FDCA (99.3%) and FurAc (99.7%) with high faradaic efficiency (FE) for FDCA (98.9%) and FurAc (99.5%), as well as superior stability retaining 96.7% FE for FDCA and 97.1% FE for FurAc after six successive electrolysis cycles. This work offers an effective approach to engineer novel electrocatalysts towards efficient upgrading of biomass-derived platform chemicals.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000719504500001

Interface engineering is an efficient way to modulate the electronic structure, tune the intermediate adsorption, and expose more active sites. Herein, we increased the concentration of interfacial sites with rich defects in a 3D hierarchical nanostructured NiO-Co3O4 electrocatalyst and investigated its catalytic performance for HMF electro-oxidation. The interface effect created abundant cation vacancies, modulated the electronic properties of Co and Ni atoms, and raised the oxidation state of Ni species. The NiO-Co3O4 catalysts show superb HMF oxidation activities with a low onset potential of 1.28 V-RHE. Meanwhile, in-situ surface-selective vibrational spectroscopy of sum-frequency generation was performed to study the reaction pathway during the oxidation process on the electrocatalysts. The current study offers an efficient way to create cation vacancies and proves the decisive role of cation vacancies in catalyzing the HMF electro-oxidation.									36	4	0	0	2	0	36			1674-7291	1869-1870		WOS:000531773200003

Occupying such niches requires the ability to rapidly acclimate to changes in electron donor/acceptor type and availability; hence, the ability to compete and thrive in such environments must ultimately be reflected in the organization and utilization of electron transfer networks, as well as central and peripheral carbon metabolism. To understand how Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 utilizes its resources, the metabolic network was reconstructed. The resulting network consists of 774 reactions, 783 genes, and 634 unique metabolites and contains biosynthesis pathways for all cell constituents. Using constraint-based modeling, we investigated aerobic growth of S. oneidensis MR-1 on numerous carbon sources. To achieve this, we (i) used experimental data to formulate a biomass equation and estimate cellular ATP requirements, (ii) developed an approach to identify cycles (such as futile cycles and circulations), (iii) classified how reaction usage affects cellular growth, (iv) predicted cellular biomass yields on different carbon sources and compared model predictions to experimental measurements, and (v) used experimental results to refine metabolic fluxes for growth on lactate. The results revealed that aerobic lactate-grown cells of S. oneidensis MR-1 used less efficient enzymes to couple electron transport to proton motive force generation, and possibly operated at least one futile cycle involving malic enzymes. Several examples are provided whereby model predictions were validated by experimental data, in particular the role of serine hydroxymethyltransferase and glycine cleavage system in the metabolism of one-carbon units, and growth on different sources of carbon and energy. This work illustrates how integration of computational and experimental efforts facilitates the understanding of microbial metabolism at a systems level.									91	1	0	0	77	0	92			1553-734X	1553-7358		WOS:000279341000028	20589080

Herein, we report that quantum-sized Au nanoparticles can photocatalytically reduce CO2 to CO with the help of H2O by electron-hole pairs mainly originating from interband transitions. Notably, the Au photocatalyst shows a CO production rate of 4.73 mmol g(-1) h(-1) (similar to 100% selectivity), similar to 2.5 times the rate during CO2 reduction with H-2 under the same experimental conditions, under low-intensity irradiation at 420 nm. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal that the increased activity is induced by surface Au-O species formed from H2O decomposition, which synchronously optimizes the rate-determining steps in the CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation reactions, lowers the energy barriers for the *CO desorption and *OOH formation, and facilitates CO and O-2 production. Our findings provide an in-depth mechanistic understanding for designing active metal photocatalysts for efficient CO2 reduction with H2O.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2041-1723		WOS:000821634700004	35794088

The ternary CNT-ZnO-Co3O4 NW composite exhibits an increased photocurrent density (1.9 mA cm(-2) at 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl, 2.7 times larger than that of the pristine ZnO NWs) and improved incident photon to current conversion efficiency (52.5% at 340 nm, 5.1 times higher than that of the pristine ZnO NWs) as a photoanode under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight. This enhancement is attributed to the specific heterogeneous ternary architecture, which results in promoted electron-hole charge separation and transfer, decreased water oxidation overpotential as well as increased reaction rates of water splitting by decorating ZnO NWs with CNTs and Co3O4.									45	1	0	0	1	0	45			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000356865300016		
J	Ullman, Andrew M.; Nocera, Daniel G.								Mechanism of Cobalt Self-Exchange Electron Transfer								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY				135	40			15053	15061		10.1021/ja404469y				OCT 9 2013	2013	A heptanuclear cobalt cluster was synthesized in two different oxidation states, Co(II)(7) and a mixed valence Co(III)Co(II)(6), as a soluble model of a cobalt-phosphate/borate (Co-OEC) water splitting catalyst. Crystallographic characterization indicates similar cluster cores, distinguished primarily at the central Co atom. An anion associates to the cluster cores via hydrogen bonding. Using an isotope exchange method, an anomalously slow self-exchange electron transfer rate constant (k(obs) = 1.53 x 10(-3) M-1 s(-1) at 40 degrees C and 38 mM [OTf] in MeCN), as compared to that predicted from semiclassical Marcus theory, supports a charge transfer process that is accelerated by dissociation of the anion from the oxidized cluster. This mechanism sheds light on the inverse dependence of anions in the self-repair mechanism of Co-OECs. Moreover, because H2O cannot directly bridge cobalt centers, owing to the encapsulation of the central Co within the cluster core, the observed results address a long-standing controversy surrounding the Co2+/3+ self-exchange electron transfer reaction of the hexaaqua complex.									34	2	0	0	4	0	34			0002-7863			WOS:000326356400029	23987247

Plant treatment with kinetin stimulated the chlorophyll and carotenoid accumulation and protected the system of chlorophyll biosynthesis at heating. However, photochemical reactions in chloroplasts of kinetin-treated leaves were more suppressed by high temperature compared to non-treated seedlings. Levulinic acid treatment of leaves inhibited photosynthetic pigment biosynthesis and decreased thermostability of chlorophyll biosynthesis system, but protected the photosynthetic activity of chloroplasts. It is concluded that thermostability of photosynthetic apparatus is increased under reduction of light harvesting pigment content. Previous analysis of the effect of dithiotreitol treatment of leaves on pigment apparatus has shown that the xanthophyll cycle contributes to the protection of photosynthetic electron transport chain under hyperthermia.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0233-4755			WOS:000234366000002

During these reactions compounds 1 and 2, or 3 and 4, crystallized simultaneously and the hafnium and zirconium complexes 1 and 3, as well as 2 and 4, were found to be isostructural and isomorphous. The characteristic structural feature which is central to 1, 2, 3, and 4 is the complex tetranuclear anion (M-4(mu(4)-O)(mu-OH)(6)[(PO2NH)(3)](4))(4-) with M = Zr or Hf. The anion consists of five corner-sharing adamantanoid cages. The central cage, {M-4(mu(4)-O)(mu-OH)(6)}(8+), has a tetracoordinated oxygen atom in the middle, and the other cages are formed by the trimetaphosphimate ions acting as tridentate ligands which coordinate to Kf or Zr. The water content of the compounds 1-4 could not be determined unequivocally by chemical analyses since the compounds are always obtained as mixtures of the rhombohedral (2/4) and cubic (1/3) phases. Thermal decomposition of compounds 1-4 starts above 120 degrees C and leads to the formation of HfP2O7 and ZrP2O7/NaZr2(PO4)(3), with the evolution of H2O and NH3. DSC measurements gave no evidence that the compounds 1 and 2, or 3 and 4, might be transformed into each other by heating.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000072817900009

Although recovery processes that convert sulfur in wastewater effluent to commodity chemicals have been proposed, chemical mechanisms of aqueous sulfur transformation are not well characterized. Quantifying and characterizing aqueous sulfur transformation can enhance the understanding of fundamental reaction steps and subsequently guide process design. In this study, we investigated the rate-limiting steps, reaction barriers, and performance of aqueous electrochemical sulfide oxidation from wastewater under direct oxidation at the anode surface and indirect oxidation with oxygen evolution. Indirect oxidation outpaced direct oxidation in terms of sulfide removal efficiency (1.4x higher for indirect) and sulfate production efficiency (3x higher for indirect). We identified thiosulfate oxidation as the rate-limiting step from electrochemical experiments with single-component sulfur solutions and confirmed elemental sulfur deposition on the electrode as the major barrier for mass transfer via scanning electrochemical microscopy. These findings translated into demonstrated trade-offs between energy demand and performance in synthetic and real anaerobic effluents while informing different operating schemes. Additionally, we achieved an inorganic sulfur mass balance of >95% using combined ion and liquid chromatography methods and advanced the use of scanning electrochemical microscopy to characterize physicochemical water treatment techniques (especially emerging electrochemical processes). Insights from this study help prioritize directions for future process-level optimization and enable the treatment of various sulfide-containing wastewaters (e.g., anaerobic effluents, produced waters). In addition to fertilizer production and sulfur management, this work also has relevance for water reuse because it enhances energy-saving anaerobic processes and a circular sulfur economy.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1				2690-0645		WOS:000822415400001

The photocurrent density of BiVO4 modified by NiFe-MOFs is increased by about 300%, and its stability is also remarkable improved. In addition, the incident photon-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) value of NiFe-MOFs/BiVO4 photoelectrode increases to 58% at 410 nm, and both the injection and separation efficiency have also been enhanced. The ameliorated OER performance can be put down to the NiFe-MOFs which significantly lifts the kinetics of water oxidation. These findings provide new ideas for the production of bimetal MOFs for efficiently promoting the performance of photoanode PEC.									20	0	0	0	4	0	20			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773483000004

The growth of the layers occurs through faradaic processes in which charges are transferred across the substrate-electrolyte interface. Since more than one reaction can occur simultaneously, it is important to study the faradaic efficiency (epsilon) associated to the growth of the desired layers and relate it to other parameters in order to optimize the process. In this work, an indirect method to determine the faradaic efficiency of electrodeposits with porosity (p) is proposed. The method was satisfactorily applied to porous -Ni(OH)(2) films obtained by light-assisted anodic electrodeposition. These films were grown using different electrolyte concentrations (C) and temperatures (T). In this case, a direct dependence of p and epsilon with C and T was found.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000443709100007

A high-throughput H-2 production assay device (H(2)PAD) is presented that enables simultaneous evaluation of 96 individual H-2 production reactions to identify components that improve performance. Using a CCD camera and image analysis software, H(2)PAD senses the chemo-optical response of Pd/WO3 thin films to the H-2 produced. H(2)PAD-enabled discovery of hydrogenase and FNR mutants that enhance biological H-2 production is reported. From a library of 10 080 randomly mutated Clostridium pasteurianum [FeFe] hydrogenases, we found a mutant with nearly 3-fold higher H-2 production specific activity. From a library of 400 semi-randomly mutated Oryza sativa FNR, the top hit enabled a 60% increase in NADPH-driven H-2 production rates. H(2)PAD can also facilitate elucidation of fundamental biochemical mechanisms within these systems.									9	0	0	0	5	0	9			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000394997200012	27976484

However, this information is often obscured by spectral congestion, and site-selective information is not available. In principle, sites of interest can be spectrally identified by isotope shifts, but site-specific isotope labeling of proteins is today possible only for favorable amino acids or with prohibitively low yields. Here we present an efficient cell-free expression system for the site-specific incorporation of any isotope-labeled amino acid into proteins. We synthesized 1.6 mg of green fluorescent protein with an isotope-labeled tyrosine from 100 mL of cell free reaction extract. We unambiguously identified spectral features of the tyrosine in the fingerprint region of the time-resolved infrared absorption spectra. Kinetic analysis confirmed the existence of an intermediate state between photoexcitation and proton transfer that lives for 3 ps. Our method lifts vibrational spectroscopy of proteins to a higher level of structural specificity.									24	0	0	0	14	0	24			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000371103900044	26796542

Firstly, pure anatase TiO2 hollow spheres (THS) were prepared via hydrothermal method using titanium butoxide, ethanol, ammonium sulphate, and urea via hydrothermal method. The copper (Cu) nanoparticles were subsequently loaded on the surface of the THS by wet impregnation. During the solvothermal process, the deposition and well dispersion of Cu/THS composites onto the graphene oxide surface. Subsequently, the reduction of graphene oxide to graphene was achieved. The morphological and structural properties of the prepared samples were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), UV-vis DRS, and photoluminescence (PL). The activities of the prepared catalysts were tested for hydrogen production via simultaneous photocatalytic water-splitting and glycerol reforming under visible light irradiation. The excellent photocatalytic activity of the Cu/THS/rGO catalyst was attributed the rGO which acts as both storage and transferor of electrons generated at the Cu and TiO2 heterojunction, thus increasing the electro-hole pairs separation. Furthermore, the effects of reaction parameters photocatalytic hydrogen production were also studied.

One significant feature of FANs is that their structures can be tailorable with fused aromatic rings without rotatable single-bond connectivity. As a result, the geometry and space orientation of the building blocks are easily incorporated to guide the topological expansion of the architectural periodicity. The variety of building units and fused linkages make FANs a promising materials platform for constitutional outline and functional design. The stably confined spaces of FAN architectures can be extended for the exchange of photons, ions, electrons, holes, and guest molecules, and exhibit customized chemical, electrochemical and optical properties. Herein, the main progress and advances in the field of 2D and 3D FANs and their utilization as a platform to develop efficient electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage applications are summarized.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000471970500011	30549302

The abundances have been derived in a self-consistent fashion, and for each group (MS or RGB), the CNO abundances are found to be in excellent star-to-star agreement. Using the dwarfs to infer the initial composition of the giants, the combined abundance patterns confirm that the giants have undergone the first dredge-up and that material processed by the CN cycle has been mixed to the surface layers. The observed abundances are compared to predictions of a standard stellar model based on the Clemson-American University of Beirut (CAUB) stellar evolution code. The model reproduces the observed evolution of the N and O abundances, as well as the previously derived C-12/C-13 ratio, but it fails to predict by a factor of 1.5 the observed level of C-12 depletion. A similar discord appears to exist in previously reported observed and modeled C abundances of giants in the Galactic disk. Random uncertainties in the mean abundances and uncertainties related to possible systematic errors in the Hyades dwarf and giant parameter scales cannot account for the discrepancy in the observed and modeled abundances. Li abundances are derived to determine if noncanonical extra mixing, like that seen in low-mass metal-poor giants, has occurred in the Hyades giants. The Li abundance of the giant gamma Tau is in good accord with the predicted level of surface Li dilution, but a similar to 0.35 dex spread in the giant Li abundances is found and cannot be explained by the stellar model. Possible sources of the spread are discussed; however, it is apparent that the differential mechanism responsible for the Li dispersion must be unrelated to the uniformly low C-12 abundances of the giants. Na, Mg, and Al abundances are derived as an additional test of our stellar model. All three elements are found to be overabundant by 0.2-0.5 dex in the giants relative to the dwarfs. Such large enhancements of these elements are not predicted by the stellar model, and non-LTE effects significantly larger (and, in some cases, of opposite sign) than those implied by extant literature calculations are the most likely cause.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000268341800070

To achieve superior PEC performance and solar to hydrogen efficiency (STH), identification, synthesis, and development of efficient photoelectrocatalysts with suitable band gap and optoelectronic properties along with high PEC activity and durability is highly imperative. With the aim of improving the performance of our previously reported bilayer photoanode of WO3 and Nb and N co-doped SnO2 nanotubes i.e. WO3-(Sn0.95Nb0.05)O-2:N NTs, herein, we report a simple and efficient strategy of molybdenum (Mo) doping into the WO3 lattice to tailor the optoelectronic properties such as band gap, charge transfer resistance, and carrier density, etc. The Mo doped bilayer i.e. (W0.98Mo0.02)O-3-(Sn0.95Nb0.05) O-2:N revealed a higher light absorption ability with reduced band gap (1.88 eV) in comparison to that of the undoped bilayer (1.94 eV). In addition, Mo incorporation offered improvements in charge carrier density, photocurrent density, with reduction in charge transfer resistance, contributing to a STH (similar to 3.12%), an applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE similar to 8% at 0.4 V), including a carrier density (N-d similar to 7.26 x 10(22) cm(-3)) superior to that of the undoped bilayer photoanode (STH similar to 2%, ABPE similar to 5.76%, and N-d similar to 5.11 x 10(22) cm(-3), respectively). The substitution of Mo6+ for W6+ in the monoclinic lattice, forming the W-O eMo bonds altered the band structure, realizing further enchantments in the PEC reaction and charge transfer kinetics. Additionally, doped bilayer photoanode revealed excellent long term PEC stability under illumination, suggesting its robustness for PEC water splitting. The present work herein provides a simple and effective Mo doping approach for generation of high performance photoanodes for PEC water splitting. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

However, the limited reserves and high cost of noble metals largely restrict their industrial applications. Along with the development of characterization techniques, theoretical calculations, and advanced material synthesis methods, modulating the electrocatalytic properties of noble metal nanocrystals at the atomic scale (e.g., monolayer/ sub-monolayer, single-atom alloy, ultrafine structure) has been flooding out. Engineering noble metal nanocrystals at the atomic level could not only immensely improve the noble metal atom utilization efficiency and lower the cost, but also boost the catalytic performance. In this review, we summarize the recent advanced progresses of regulating the noble metal nanocrystals at the atomic scale towards energy conversion application. Then, the challenges and perspectives of designing noble metal nanocrystals at the atomic scale in the future are discussed and considered. It is expected that this review will inspire scientists to further study precious metal-based materials for energy-oriented catalysis.

The O-isotopic composition of the grain indicates an origin in a low-mass (similar to 2.2M(circle dot)), approximately solar metallicity red/asymptotic giant branch (RGB/AGB) star undergoing first dredge-up. The magnetite is a single crystal measuring 750 x 670 nm, is free of defects, and is stoichiometric Fe3O4. We hypothesize that the magnetite formed via oxidation of previously condensed Fe dust within the circumstellar envelope of its progenitor star. Using an empirically derived rate constant for this reaction, we calculate that such oxidation could have occurred over timescales ranging from approximately similar to 9000-500,000 years. This timescale is within the lifetime of estimates for dust condensation within RGB/AGB stars.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000359062500055

The fungal coinfections in COVID-19 hosts with predisposing conditions and immunosuppressive medications are posing higher severity and death. The immunological counteraction (innate/adaptive immunity) is triggered when the PRRs on the host cells recognize the fungal PAMPs. However, in simultaneous infections (COVID-19 and fungal coinfection), the synergism of TLR and NLR may hyperactivate the immune cells which dramatically increase the cytokine level and generate cytokine storm. Fungal colonization in the human gut assists the development of microbiome assembly, ecology, and shaping immune response. However, SARS-CoV-2 infection represented unstable mycobiomes and long-term dysbiosis in a large proportion in COVID-19 patients. Normally, amphotericin B is considered as first-line treatment for invasive fungal infection. So, amphotericin B therapy is recommended in COVID-19 hosts with serious fungal infections. Still, the long-term corticosteroid supplementation prescribed in case of severe pneumonia and lower oxygen levels may result in systemic fungal infection in COVID-19 patients, eventually limiting the lifesaving benefits of available medications. Also, due to the evolution of fungal resistance to available antibiotics, the current treatments are becoming ineffective. Therefore, this review summarizes the concerns, needed to deal with the impending crises.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0273-2289	1559-0291		WOS:000804499300001	35648275

A dynamic hydrogen bubble template approach is applied to electrodeposit a binary PdCu alloy foam yielding a nominal bulk composition of 9 at% Pd and 91 at% Cu (denoted as Pd9Cu91). The material is further modified by means of thermal annealing (12 h at 200 degrees C in air), which completely transforms the as-prepared metallic Pd(9)Cu(91)alloy foam into its oxidic state. The ultimate catalyst activation is achieved by subsequent reduction (at -0.65 Vvs.RHE for 45 min) of the oxidic precursors (composite of Cu2O, CuO, and CuPdO3) into metallic state, as indicated byoperandoRaman spectroscopy. Identical location scanning electron microscopy (IL-SEM) analysis, carried out prior to and after the activation treatments, demonstrates significant morphological alterations of the Pd(9)Cu(91)foam on the nm length scale, which go along with a phase segregation into nm-range Pd-rich and Cu-rich domains that helps to increase the PrOH selectivity. Time-dependent ICP-MS analyses of the electrolyte solution, carried out during the catalyst activation, demonstrate preferential (rapid) Cu dissolution followed by (slow) Cu redeposition on the catalyst surface. These processes are found to be superimposed on the actual oxide reduction. A two-fold selectivity of PrOH was observed over ethanol (EtOH). The excellent long-term stability of the activated Pd(9)Cu(91)foam catalyst is rationalized by the full suppression of the C1 hydrocarbon (methane) pathway. The improved product selectivity towards the highly valuable C3 alcohol is rationalized by an efficient and concerted spillover of chemisorbed carbon monoxide (*CO) and atomic hydrogen (*H) species from the Pd-rich domains to the activated Cu-rich domains of the oxide-derived Pd(9)Cu(91)foam catalyst where the C-C coupling and subsequent hydrogenation processes take place to form the targeted oxygenate product.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000575015700020

In the synthesis, the cotton denim waste is mixed with H3PO4 in two different denim/H3PO4 (wt/vol) ratios, namely, 1:1 and 1:3, wherein H3PO4 serves as both an activating agent and a source of P dopant atoms while the indigo carmine dye present in denim serves as a source of N dopant atoms to the carbon materials. The resulting P- and N-co-doped carbon materials, named PNC1 and PNC3, respectively, are characterized by various analytical techniques. The XPS spectra show that PNC1 has ca. 2.17 atomic % P and 1.95 atomic % N whereas PNC3 has 2.54 atomic % P and 0.71 atomic % N. Pore analyses by N-2 porosimetry indicate that PNC1 has a higher surface area (1582 m(2) g(-1)) than PNC3 (486 m(2) g(-1)), although the former has a lower mesopore volume (0.39 cm(3) g(-1)) than the latter (0.58 cm(3) g(-1)). The SEM images of the two materials also show some notable structural differences. The results overall indicate that the structures and compositions of the materials can be easily tailored by varying the ratio of denim/H3PO4 in the precursor. The electrocatalytic activities of PNC1 and PNC3 toward HzOR were then evaluated, and PNC3 is found to be a better electrocatalyst than PNC1. In a 100 mmol L-1 hydrazine solution in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) at pH 7.4, PNC3 electrocatalyzes the reaction at a lower peak potential (ca. 0.70 V vs RHE) than PNC1 (ca. 0.77 V vs RHE). Additionally, the current density obtained during HzOR over PNC3 is higher (by 1.29 times) than the one obtained over PNC1. Furthermore, the onset potential by which PNC3 electrocatalyzes HzOR (0.42 V vs RHE) is comparable to or better than the values reported for some of the best HzOR electrocatalysts in the literature. Besides their high electrocatalytic activity, the materials remain stable during electrocatalysis of HzOR									21	1	0	0	0	0	21			2574-0962			WOS:000462944700083

Because of the difficulty of performing laboratory experiments with corals, the sea anemone Aiptasia has emerged as an important model system for molecular studies of coral bleaching and symbiosis. Here, we investigate natural variation in bleaching responses among different genetic lineages of Aiptasia. Both heat- and cold-induced paths to symbiosis breakdown were analyzed. Significant genetic variation in response to acute heat stress was observed, with severe bleaching of two Aiptasia strains from Hawaii but minimal bleaching of strains from the U.S. South Atlantic, including the strain used to generate the Aiptasia reference genome. Both strains from Hawaii hosted Symbiodinium type B1, whereas strains from the U.S. South Atlantic hosted type A4 or B2. In contrast to the results from exposures to acute heat stress, negligible variation was observed in response to a pulsed cold shock despite moderate bleaching across all strains. These results support our hypothesis that bleaching responses to distinct stressors are independent. Our findings emphasize the role of stress regime when predicting adaptive responses of symbiotic cnidarians to changing climates, because genetic variation may exist for some forms of stress-induced bleaching but not others.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0006-3185	1939-8697		WOS:000423262700006	29373064

Herein, we report the modification of intermetallic PtBi hexagonal nanoplates by depositing trace amounts of Pd atoms (PtBi@1.8% Pd HNPs) to obviously improve the selectivity of the dehydrogenation path instead of the dehydration path, achieving highly efficient formic acid electrocatalysis. Impressively, PtBi@1.8% Pd exhibits superior mass activity of 4.17 A mg(Pt+Pd)(-1), which is 27 and 9.6 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C and Pd black catalysts, respectively. During chronoamperometry measurements, PtBi@1.8% Pd maintains much higher mass activity than the benchmark catalysts. The excellent electrocatalytic performances are attributed to the synergetic effect between the tensile-strained/electronic-modified Pd and the electronic-modified intermetallic PtBi, providing a novel co-modification strategy to boost electrocatalysis.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000637061200001

The catalyst showed enhanced catalytic activity, particularly after application of a reducing/oxidizing conditioning step at 250 degrees C, with a pronounced dependence on the reducing agent (C3H6 < H-2 < CO). In situ time -resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Ce L-3-edge unraveled a dependence of the reduction extent of ceria during temperature -programmed reduction on the noble metal constituent and the applied reducing agent. Dynamic reducing/oxidizing cycling (2% H-2 <-> 10% O-2 or 2% CO <-> 10% 02) at various temperatures (150, 250, and 350 degrees C) showed that the reducibility of ceria increased at higher temperature and by using a more strongly reducing reaction mixture. This coincides with the trend in catalytic activity. Time-resolved XAS data recorded at the Pt L-3-edge and Ce L-3-edge during redox cycling revealed a close relationship between the Pt oxidation state and the ceria redox response. The formation of reduced Pt particles was found to induce variations in ceria reducibility under transient conditions and was identified as a decisive prerequisite for ceria reduction at low temperatures. Variations in the extent of ceria reduction during the reducing/oxidizing cycles indicate an evolution of the Pt-ceria interface from an inactive state toward an optimal activated state due to reduction and slight sintering of the noble metal particles. Further growth of Pt particles leads to a decrease in ceria reduction rate due to the smaller Pt-CeO2 interface perimeter. A schematic model illustrating the role of Pt for ceria reducibility is developed and the optimal Pt particle size derived. The results are relevant for various applications, particularly for catalysts operated at low temperature under highly dynamic reaction conditions such as exhaust gas catalysts.									103	2	1	0	9	0	104			2155-5435			WOS:000434369600008

Here, we develop a sequential chemical etching and sulfurization strategy to prepare well-defined double-shelled zinc-cobalt sulfide (Zn-Co-S) rhombic dodecahedral cages (RDCs). Yolk-shelled zinc/cobalt-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (Zn/Co-ZIF) RDCs are first synthesized by a controlled chemical etching process, followed by a hydrothermal sulfurization reaction to prepare double-shelled Zn-Co-S RDCs. Moreover, the strategy reported in this work enables easy control of the Zn/Co molar ratio in the obtained double-shelled Zn-Co-S RDCs. Owing to the structural and compositional benefits, the obtained double-shelled Zn-Co-S RDCs exhibit enhanced performance with high specific capacitance (1266 Fg(-1) at 1 Ag-1), good rate capability and long-term cycling stability (91% retention over 10,000 cycles) as a battery-type electrode material for hybrid supercapacitors.									333	7	0	0	12	0	336			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000402857800023	28488748

An impediment to MAR applications, where oxygenated water is recharged into anoxic aquifers, is the potential mobilization of trace metals (e.g., arsenic). While conceptual models for arsenic transport under such circumstances exist, they are generally not rigorously evaluated through numerical modeling, especially at field-scale. In this work, geochemical data from an injection experiment in The Netherlands, where the introduction of oxygenated water into an anoxic aquifer mobilized arsenic, was used to develop and evaluate conceptual and numerical models of arsenic release and attenuation under field-scale conditions. Initially, a groundwater flow and nonreactive transport model was developed. Subsequent reactive transport simulations focused on the description of the temporal and spatial evolution of the redox zonation. The calibrated model was then used to study and quantify the transport of arsenic. In the model that best reproduced field observations, the fate of arsenic was simulated by (i) release via codissolution of arsenopyrite, stoichiometrically linked to pyrite oxidation, (ii) kinetically controlled oxidation of dissolved As(III) to As(V), and (iii) As adsorption via surface complexation on neo-precipitated iron oxides.									54	2	0	0	35	0	55			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000279304700036	20518522

Here we describe an unusual hydrothermal system associated with Savo volcano, a recently eruptive (1830-1840 AD) trachyte-dominated island arc stratovolcano in the Solomon Islands. Hot springs (similar to 100 degrees C) near to the volcanic crater discharge alkaline waters instead of the more commonly recognised acidic fluids.The hydrothermal system of Savo dominantly discharges sinter and travertine-forming alkaline sulphate (pH 7-8) waters at hot springs on its upper flanks, in addition to a small number of lower discharge acid sulphate springs (pH 2-7). Alkaline sulphate fluids are dilute, chloride-poor (<50 mg/l), sulphate- (>600 mg/l) and silica-rich (>250 mg/l). They have restricted delta S-34(SO4) (5.4 +/- 1.5 parts per thousand) and delta O-18(H2O) values (-4 parts per thousand; local non-thermal groundwater is 8 parts per thousand). Acid sulphate springs discharge low chloride (<20 mg/l), high sulphate (300-800 mg/l) waters, with variable silica (100-300 mg/l) and distinctly lower delta S-34(SO4) values (-0.6 +/- 2.5 parts per thousand) compared to the alkaline sulphate fluids. They also display high delta O-18(H2O) and delta D-H2O relative to non-thermal groundwater.Geochemical modelling shows that water-rock reaction and dilution in the presence of secondary anhydrite, pyrite and quartz leads to chloride being diluted to low concentrations, whilst maintaining high sulphate and silica concentrations in the fluid. Strontium, oxygen and hydrogen isotopes confirm water-rock reaction and mixing with groundwater as primary controls on the composition of the alkaline sulphate springs.The highly unusual dilute chemistry of all discharges at Savo is a consequence of high regional rainfall, i.e. climatic control, and results from open system mixing at depth between hydrothermal and meteoric waters.

Effect of electrode reactions during aqueous electrophoretic deposition on bulk suspension properties and deposition quality								Key Engineering Materials				654				3	9		10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.654.3				2015	2015	Non-aqueous solvents have been popularly used as suspending medium in Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) for several applications. The drawbacks of these solvents are that they cause environmental concerns and are expensive. Therefore, there is a great interest for the development aqueous EPD, which is low-cost and environmental friendly. There are several problems when using water as the suspending medium in EPD. First, there is gas evolution at the electrodes on application of the electric field. Hydrogen is generated at cathode and oxygen at anode. This results in incorporation of bubbles in deposits and the quality of deposit suffers. Several approaches, such as the use of pulse DC, asymmetric AC, and palladium electrode have been reported in the literature to overcome this problem.However, the biggest problem concerning aqueous EPD is reproducibility of deposition. As an example, in batch EPD of Al2O3 from aqueous suspension, we observed the best quality of deposition from the first deposit. Invariably, the amount and quality of deposit decreased progressively with increased number of deposition from the same suspension. For prolonged first deposition, the deterioration became severe and no deposition occurred from the second deposition onwards. This occurred even for cases when only a small fraction of the powder suspension is depleted in the first deposit. A closer look showed destabilized suspension and significant change in bulk pH of the suspension. Here, we measured the change in bulk pH as a function of time, and starting pH during water electrolysis as well as during aqueous EPD of Al2O3. The bulk pH of suspension increased with increasing time of deposition and with increasing applied voltages, resulting in progressive destabilization of suspension and decrease in deposit yield and quality. Use of suitable dosages of cationic dispersant polyethyleneimine (PEI) in the suspension decreased the extent of bulk pH variation during aqueous EPD.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1013-9826			INSPEC:15674480

Herein, a highly efficient and durable trifunctional electrocatalyst RuCoOx is prepared by a unique one-pot glucose-blowing approach. Remarkably, RuCoOx catalyst exhibits a small potential difference (Delta E) of 0.65 V and low HER overpotential of 37 mV (10 mA cm(-2)), as well as a negligible decay of overpotential after 200 000/10 000/10 000 CV cycles for ORR/OER/HER, all of which show overwhelming superiorities among the advanced trifunctional electrocatalysts. When used in liquid rechargeable Zn-air batteries and water splitting electrolyzer, RuCoOx exhibits high efficiency and outstanding durability even at quite large current density. Such excellent performance can be attributed to the rational combination of targeted ORR/OER/HER active sites into one electrocatalyst based on the double-phase coupling strategy, which induces sufficient electronic structure modulation and synergistic effect for enhanced trifunctional properties.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000756421600035	34761938

Together with many other genes, all genes encoding antioxidant enzymes and enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of low molecular weight antioxidants were transferred to the nucleus. On the other hand, photosynthesis bears a high risk for photo-oxidative damage. Concomitantly, an intricate network for mutual regulation by anthero- and retrograde signals has emerged to co-ordinate the activities of the different genetic and metabolic compartments. A major focus of recent research in chloroplast regulation addressed the mechanisms of redox sensing and signal transmission, the identification of regulatory targets, and the understanding of adaptation mechanisms. In addition to redox signals communicated through signalling cascades also used in pathogen and wounding responses, specific chloroplast signals control nuclear gene expression. Signalling pathways are triggered by the redox state of the plastoquinone pool, the thioredoxin system, and the acceptor availability at photosystem I, in addition to control by oxolipins, tetrapyrroles, carbohydrates, and abscisic acid. The signalling function is discussed in the context of regulatory circuitries that control the expression of antioxidant enzymes and redox modulators, demonstrating the principal role of chloroplasts as the source and target of redox regulation.					17th International Botanical Congress17th International Botanical Congress	JUL 17-23, 2005JUL 17-23, 2005		Vienna, AUSTRIAVienna, AUSTRIA	194	10	4	0	184	0	207			0022-0957	1460-2431		WOS:000229285900003	15863449

Due to their poor charge conductivity, the application of many metal oxides as cocatalysts has been limited. In this work, using photoanode Ti/Fe2O3 and cocatalyst CoOx as a model system, we elaborately design a charge transfer channel of metal Co between the photoanode and cocatalyst. Such a ternary nanostructure has proved to possess several advantageous features, including effective charge separation efficiency, long lifetime of photogenerated holes, and fast charge transport from the photoanode to the surface of the cocatalyst. Benefiting from these desirable nanostructures, the photoanode, containing a charge transfer channel of metal Co, exhibited a remarkable photoelectrochemical performance for water oxidation, with an almost 7-fold enhancement in the photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs. RHE under visible light illumination and about a 0.15 V water oxidation onset potential negative shift compared to the Ti/Fe2O3 photoanode. These findings demonstrate that the successful construction of a metallic charge transfer channel between the photoanode and cocatalyst should be employed as a general strategy for photoconversion applications.									52	0	0	0	0	0	52			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000387166900046

Here, a simple and quick one-step hydrothermal method was used to successfully fabricate a three-dimensional core chrysanthemum-like FeS/Ni3S2 heterogeneous nanoarray (FeS/Ni3S2@NF) on a porous nickel foam skeleton. Compared with the monomer Ni3S2@NF, the chrysanthemum-like FeS/Ni3S2@NF heterostructure nanomaterials have improved catalytic performance in alkaline media, showing low overpotentials of 192 mV (eta(10)) and 130 mV (eta(-1)(0)) for OER and HER, respectively. This study attests that integrated interface engineering and precise morphology control are effective strategies for activating the Ni3+/Ni2+ coupling, promoting charge transfer and improving the intrinsic activity of the material to accelerate the OER reaction kinetics and promote the overall water splitting performance. The scheme can be reasonably applied to the design and development of transition metal sulfide-based electrocatalysts to put into industrial practice of electrochemical water oxidation.

Here we demonstrate that series interconnected absorbers in a PV-electrolysis configuration based on the compound semiconductor CIGS, CuInxGa1-xSe2, are a highly interesting concept for solar water splitting applications. The band gap energy of CIGS can be adjusted to a value close to optimum for efficient absorption of the solar spectrum, but is too low to drive overall water splitting. Therefore we connect three cells in series, into a monolithic device, which provides sufficient driving force for the full reaction. Integrated with a catalyst this forms a stable PV/photo-electrochemical device, which when immersed in water reaches over 10% solar-to-hydrogen efficiency for unassisted water splitting. The results show that series interconnected device concepts, which enable use of a substantial part of the solar spectrum, provide a simple route towards highly efficient water splitting and could be used also for other solar absorbers with similar electro-optical properties. We discuss how the efficiency could be increased for this particular device, as well as the general applicability of the concepts used in this work. We also briefly discuss advantages and disadvantages of photo-electrochemical cells in relation to PV-electrolysis with respect to our results.									172	7	0	0	16	0	174			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000327250300028

Further effects on the overall electrolysis efficiency of advance alkaline water is also studied. The hydroxy gas (HHO) has been produced experimentally by the electrolysis of alkaline water with parallel plate electrode of 316L-grade stainless steel. The electrode has been selected on the basis of corrosion resistance and inertness with respect to electrolyte (KOH). The process used for the production of HHO is conventional as compared to the other production processes because of reduced energy consumption, less maintenance and low setup cost.

Herein, a nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) dual-doped 3D porous graphene catalyst is synthesized via a single-row pyrolysis using biomass as solitary source for both N and S, and structure directing agent. The thermochemical reaction of biomass functional groups with graphene oxide facilitates in situ generation of reactive N and S species, stimulating the graphene layers to reorganize into a trimodal 3D porous assembly. The resultant catalyst exhibits high ORR and OER performance superior to similar materials obtained through toxic chemicals and multistep routes. Its stability and tolerance to CO and methanol oxidation molecules are far superior to commercial Pt/C. The dynamics governing the structural transformation and the enhanced catalytic activity in both alkaline and acidic media are discussed. This work offers a unique approach for rapid synthesis of a dual heteroatom doped 3D porous-graphene-architecture for wider applications.									118	9	0	0	7	0	118			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000387095300025	27740758

Linear programming and uniform random sampling were applied herein to identify candidate steady states of the metabolic network that were consistent with the imposed physico-chemical constraints and available experimental data. The activity of the mitochondrion was studied under four metabolic conditions: normal physiologic, diabetic, ischemic, and dietetic. Pairwise correlations between steady-state reaction fluxes were calculated in each condition to evaluate the dependence among the reactions in the network. Applying constraints on exchange fluxes resulted in predictions for intracellular fluxes that agreed with experimental data. Analyses of the steady-state flux distributions showed that the experimentally observed reduced activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase in vivo could be a result of stoichiometric constraints and therefore would not necessarily require enzymatic inhibition. The observed changes in the energy metabolism of the mitochondrion under diabetic conditions were used to evaluate the impact of previously suggested treatments. The results showed that neither normalized glucose uptake nor decreased ketone body uptake have a positive effect on the mitochondrial energy metabolism or network flexibility. Taken together, this study showed that sampling of the steady-state flux space is a powerful method to investigate network properties under different conditions and provides a basis for in silico evaluations of effects of potential disease treatments.									110	1	1	0	98	0	111				1083-351X		WOS:000227761800097	15572364

We studied proton release in chloride-depleted thylakoids which were dark-adapted and excited by flashing light. Proton release was blocked from the second flash on, possibly leaving an uncompensated positive charge in the catalytic centre. The reduction of P680+ by Tyr(Z) was still very rapid (much less than 10 mus). From the third flash on, P680+ was reduced more slowly (70 mus/200 mus), and by an electrogenic back-reaction. The uncompensated positive charge may be the reason why the rapid reduction of P680+ by Tyr(Z) is prevented and the transmembrane charge-pair recombination is facilitated.									14	0	0	0	13	0	14			0014-5793			WOS:A1993MN45700026	8262251

To improve the application, a 2D/3D fluid model is needed to investigate the CO2 conversion mechanisms in the actual discharge geometry. Therefore, the complex CO2 chemical kinetics description must be reduced due to the huge computational cost associated with 2D/3D models. This paper presents a chemistry reduction method for CO2 plasmas, based on the so-called directed relation graph method. Depending on the defined threshold values, some marginal species are identified. By means of a sensitivity analysis, we can further reduce the chemistry set by removing one by one the marginal species. Based on the so-called flux-sensitivity coupling, we obtain a reduced CO2 kinetics model, consisting of 36 or 15 species (depending on whether the 21 asymmetric mode vibrational states of CO2 are explicitly included or lumped into one group), which is applied to a GA discharge. The results are compared with those predicted with the full chemistry set, and very good agreement is reached. Moreover, the range of validity of the reduced CO2 chemistry set is checked, telling us that this reduced set is suitable for low power GA discharges. Finally, the time and spatial evolution of the CO2 plasma characteristics are presented, based on a 2D model with the reduced kinetics.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0963-0252	1361-6595		WOS:000525600600001

This property is the key factor in the developing of cost-effective and efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) electrocatalysts for sustainable hydrogen production. In this study, novel electrocatalysts which are decorated with Pt and Ru have been developed for HER electrocatalysis. Microscopic analysis such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) are performed to determine the morphological and compositional structures. Electrocatalysis properties are evaluated by cathodic current-potential curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 1.0 M KOH solution. Chronoamperometry (CA) and cycle tests are used for stability/durability of electrocatalysts. Results show that a small onset potential of the porous Cu/Ni/CuZn-Pt is obtained for HER. Exchange current density and polarization resistance are found to be 5.39 mA cm(-2) and 2.0 U cm(2) at overpotential of -100 mV for porous Cu/Ni/CuZn-Pt, respectively, indicating that Cu/Ni/CuZn-Pt is higher electrocatalytic properties than the others. Moreover, very low overpotentials at 10 and 40 mA cm(-2) are obtained on porous Cu/Ni/CuZn-Pt compared with porous Cu/Ni/CuZn-Ru and Cu/Ni/CuZn. Porous Cu/Ni/CuZn-Pt also displays excellent stability/durability in test solution. The remarkable electro-catalysis properties of porous Cu/Ni/CuZn-Pt can be explained due to high porous structure, leaching of Zn from the deposit, intrinsic activity of Pt as well as changing in the electronic structure. It should be considered that porous Cu/Ni/CuZn-Pt is of high corrosion resistance in test solution for 120 h, which makes it good candidate for HER. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

C	Wertheimer, MR; Bartnikas, R						DAgostino, R; Favia, P; Fracassi, F		Degradation effects of plasma and corona on polymers								PLASMA PROCESSING OF POLYMERS		NATO ADVANCED SCIENCE INSTITUTES SERIES, SERIES E, APPLIED SCIENCES		346				435	450						1997	1997	Low-pressure plasma processing of materials can be divided into three categories, namely (A) etching (removal of material), (B) deposition (addition of new material to a surface), and (C) modification (morphological, structural, and physicochemical change of the surface or near-surface region). In industries which make extensive use of low-pressure plasmas (for example, in the manufacture of integrated circuits- IC, the treatment of polymers for improved adhesion, etc), the above-named changes are deliberate and highly beneficial. However, there exist many instances where treatment can turn into a liability, or where plasma-chemical changes occur involuntarily and are a priori detrimental. The main objective of this chapter is to sensitize the reader to the existence of circumstances where plasma effects can be deleterious, for example:(1) Corona discharges, also known as silent discharges or dielectric barrier discharges, are a form of plasma which occurs when insulating materials are exposed to an alternating source of high voltage (similar to 10 kV). Corona is comprised of multitudes of ultra-rapid (similar to 100 ns), narrow (similar to 100 mu m) filamentary micro-discharges, which impinge upon the dielectric surface. Since the 1950s corona is being used commercially for treating polymeric webs up to 8 m in width, so as to render them printable (process category (C) above). However, corona treatment (like its low-pressure counterpart) can be detrimental if "overtreatment" occurs: If the reagent gas, like ambient air, contains oxygen, low-molecular-weight oxidized materials (LMWOM) form on the surface, and these can give rise to a weak boundary layer. This laboratory has compared corona and glow discharge treatment of LDPE and PET, using peel strength and XPS measurements, and has found similar "optimum" treatment criteria for both types of processes: High treatment (oxidation) levels could be correlated with elevated concentrations of acidic (O = C - O) reaction products and low peel strength.(2) Corona (in this context referred to as "partial discharges", PD) occurs involuntarily in high voltage electrotechnology, for example in occluded gas voids in polymeric insulation used in various types of high voltage equipment. We describe the evolution and nature of chemical reaction products on chemically cross-linked PE (XLPE) cable insulation, and on epoxy resin of the type used in rotating machine insulation, under PD exposure durations ranging from minutes to thousands of hours. We have observed that acidic LMWOM on an epoxy surface can modify its electrical properties to the point that PD (corona) behaviour gives way to a pulseless atmospheric pressure glow discharge (APGD) regime.(3) Plasma etching of polymers (category (A)) is a key process in IC manufacture, for example in the dry removal of photolithographic resins. In Low Earth Orbit (LEO) spaceflight, however, very similar chemistry can lead to rapid erosive degradation of polymeric materials used in the construction of space vehicles. Recent work in our laboratory has clearly established that this is due to synergistic interactions of ultraviolet photons and oxygen atoms with the polymer surfaces, and that these surfaces can be protected by a thin PECVD SiO2 coating (category (B)).

J	Weise, Andreas; Kluge, Tobias					Kluge, Tobias/0000-0001-7559-4737			Isotope exchange rates in dissolved inorganic carbon between 40 degrees C and 90 degrees C								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				268				56	72		10.1016/j.gca.2019.09.032				JAN 1 2020	2020	Carbonate minerals are normally closely related to the stable and clumped isotope composition of the parent solution and are often assumed to record the equilibrium conditions in these proxies. Variations in e.g., temperature, pH or salinity lead to changes in the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) composition and to temporary deviations from expected isotopic equilibrium values. The exchange rate, at which the new equilibrium of stable and clumped isotopes is reached, has only been assessed experimentally for clumped isotopes between 5 degrees C and 25 degrees C and for delta O-18 up to 40 degrees C.In this study the delta O-18 and Delta(4)(7) evolution in the DIC pool of 0.1 molar sodium bicarbonate solutions at pH 8 and various temperatures (40 degrees C, 55 degrees C, 70 degrees C, 90 degrees C) was examined. At time intervals corresponding to the evolution of the DIC, a quantitative and instantaneous precipitation of the DIC was accomplished by adding strontium chloride and sodium hydroxide solutions. As the delta C-13 of the SrCO3 precipitates was constant and no significant non-first order trend was observed in Delta(47), delta O-18 and Delta(47) values could be simply fitted with an exponential approach to isotopic equilibrium. The temperature dependence of the rate constants was evaluated with the Arrhenius equation. The resulting rate constant based on the combined data points from delta O-18 and Delta 47 follows ask(T)[min(-1)] = exp((-1.00 +/- 0.15) . 10(4) *1/T+ (29 +/- 4))The inferred exchange rate constants for Delta(47) are of the same order of magnitude as those of the oxygen isotopes and show a similar temperature dependence in the investigated temperature range.Our experimental results suggest that the isotopic equilibration of DIC in a solution with pH < 10 and elevated temperatures is rapid (at 70 degrees C: 4.5 min, at 90 degrees C: 36 s for 99% equilibrium) and that even in the case of short-term disturbances an equilibrated DIC composition is very likely for solutions in the diagenetic temperature range above 100 degrees C. In contrast, it is important to consider the generally long equilibration times at low temperatures (e.g., 2-6 days at pH 8.0-8.5 and 0 degrees C) and, in particular, at higher pH (e.g., >100 days at pH 11 and 0 degrees C).

Heterostructures exhibit great application potential in the field of energy catalysis because of the accelerated charge transfer and increased active sites on their surfaces. In this work, CoS2 nanoparticles decorated on MoS2 nanorods are constructed and act as a superior cathode catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries. Coupling MoS2 and CoS2 can not only synergistically enhance their electrical conductivity and electrochemical activity, but also promote the heteroepitaxial growth of discharge products on the heterojunction interfaces, thus delivering high discharge capacity, stable cycle performance, and good rate capability.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000729407100001	34897989

Herein, we construct a series of In2S3/NU-1000 heterojunction photocatalysts, which can efficiently catalyze the oxidation of sulfides to form sulfoxides as the sole product under LED lamp (full-spectrum) illumination in air at room temperature. Especially, the sulfur mustard simulant, 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), can also be photocatalytically oxidized with In2S3/NU-1000 to afford nontoxic 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfoxide (CEESO) selectively and effectively. In contrast, individual NU-1000 and In2S3 show very low catalytic activity on this reaction. The significantly improved photocatalytic activity is ascribed to the constructing of an efficient Z-scheme photocatalysts In2S3/NU-1000, which exhibits the enhancement of light harvesting, the promotion of photogenerated electron-hole separation, and the retention of high porosity of the parent MOF. Moreover, mechanism studies in photocatalytic oxidation reveal that the superoxide radical (O-.(2)-) and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) are the main oxidative species in the oxidation system. This work exploits the opportunities for the construction of porous Z-scheme photocatalysts based on the photoactive MOFs materials and inorganic semiconductors for promoting catalytic organic transformations. More importantly, it provides a route to the rational design of efficient photocatalysts for the detoxification of mustard gas.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000735912100001	34889478

To understand the possible role of the globin moiety in stabilizing the FeO2 bond in these proteins, we examined the autoxidation rate of bovine heart oxymyoglobin (MbO(2)) to its ferric met-form (metMb) in the presence of 8 M urea at 25 degrees C and found that the rate was markedly enhanced above the normal autoxidation in buffer alone over the whole range of pH 5-13. Taking into account the concomitant process of unfolding of the protein in 8 M urea, we then formulated a kinetic procedure to estimate the autoxidation rate of the unfolded form of MbO(2) that might appear transiently in the possible pathway of denaturation. As a result, the fully denatured MbO(2) was disclosed to be extremely susceptible to autoxidation with an almost constant rate over a wide range of pH 5-11. At pH 8.5, for instance, its rate was nearly 1000 times higher than the corresponding value of native MbO(2). These findings lead us to conclude that the unfolding of the globin moiety allows much easier attack of the solvent water molecule or hydroxyl ion on the FeO2 center and causes a very rapid formation of the ferric met-species by the nucleophilic displacement mechanism. In the molecular evolution from simple ferrous complexes to myoglobin and hemoglobin molecules, therefore, the protein matrix can be depicted as a breakwater of the FeO2 bonding against protic, aqueous solvents.									32	0	0	0	19	2	32			0006-3495			WOS:A1995RX25100031	8527673

Two Ti-13V-11Cr-3Al powder compacts with different oxygen content were manufactured by mixing PREP and HDH Ti powders with Cr and AlV master alloy powders, respectively. The effect of isothermal holding time, at a sintering temperature of 1573 K (1300 A degrees C), on pore characteristics and compositional homogeneity was investigated in this study. Pore coarsening by Ostwald ripening occurred with an increase in the isothermal holding time and Kirkendall voids were produced by a reaction between Ti and Cr. After an isothermal holding time of 10 minutes, the two sintered powder compacts had a homogeneous composition. Ti/AlV and Ti/Cr diffusion couples were used to predict the distribution of alloying elements, and the binary Ti-V, Ti-Al, and Ti-Cr interdiffusion coefficients were consistent with the distribution of alloying elements after isothermal holding. The mechanical properties of sintered powder compacts, prepared using PREP Ti powder as the raw powder, were optimized by sintered density and pore size.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1073-5623	1543-1940		WOS:000360558200033

In this study biogenic AgNP prepared from leaf extract of Swertia chirata was utilized to address the problems associated with conservation of endangered medicinal plant through plant tissue culture. Endangered as well as economically important medicinal plant considered for this analysis was the same plant S. chirata itself. Excessive deforestation and exploration of this plant had led to complete eradication of the natural reservoir. Thus in vitro plant tissue propagation had attained much importance for maintaining the plant species. Nano-sized particles of diameter 20 nm encapped by different phytochemicals applied on regenerating shoot cultures showed enhanced shoot induction and proliferation. Other forms of silver like AgNO3 (SN) and Ag2S2O3 (STS) showed improved regeneration in comparison to control samples. Ethylene precursors like 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and 2-chloroethylphosphonic acid (CEPA) downregulated the regeneration process considerably. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) status of the treated cultures were evaluated considering hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in treated cells as wells as their antioxidant enzyme activity. Combined manipulation and coordination of ethylene evolution, maintenance of ROS balance and better bio-acceptance of AgNP were responsible for improvement in shoot regeneration of the plant. Phytoencapsulated and nano-dimensioned Ag was capable of changing the chemical reactions of different regulating players of plant regeneration. These findings will facilitate the understanding and future utilization of biofabricated AgNP in agriculture and plant sciences.									25	0	0	0	16	0	26			0167-6857	1573-5044		WOS:000437398400010

However, the fast recombination of carriers in the bulk and on the surface greatly constrains the solar-to-chemical fuel conversion efficiency. Herein, a precise method was utilized to alleviate the recombination by constructing p-n junction of CaFe2O4/alpha-Fe2O3 and further modifying with Co3O4. The structural information and chemical composition of the ternary compound were systematically characterized. The photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) of the photoanode increased by five times compared to the bare alpha-Fe2O3, and the onset potential also shifted negatively to 0.6 V vs RHE. The formation of p-n junction and surface Co3O4 modification were proven to enhance the charge separation in the bulk and on the surface, respectively. Also the Co3O4 played a bifunctional role of passivating the surface states and accelerating the water oxidation kinetics. .									25	3	0	0	1	0	25			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000452842500012

In this communication, FeCo2S4 nanosheet was grown in situ on nickel foam (FeCo2S4/NF) via a facile hydrothermal sulfidization method and served as a high-efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. As-synthesized FeCo2S4/NF self-supported electrode delivers 20 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 259 mV toward OER and 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 131 mV toward HER in alkaline media. Moreover, when used as both anode and cathode in a two-electrode electrolyzer, only a small cell voltage of 1.541 V is needed to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting.

The atomic structure of the PVP-stabilized Au24Clx was investigated by means of aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (ACTEM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. ACTEM video imaging revealed that the Au24Clx clusters were stable against dissociation but fluctuated during the observation period. Some of the high-resolution ACTEM snapshots were explained by DFT-optimized isomeric structures in which all the constituent atoms were located on the surface. This observation suggests that the featureless optical spectrum of Au24Clx is associated with the coexistence of distinctive isomers. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy of CO adsorbates revealed the electron-rich nature of Au24Clx clusters due to the interaction with PVP. The Au24Clx:PVP clusters catalyzed the aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol derivatives without degradation. Hammett analysis and the kinetic isotope effect indicated that the hydride elimination by Au24Clx was the rate-limiting step with an apparent activation energy of 56 +/- 3 kJ/mol, whereas the oxygen pressure dependence of the reaction kinetics suggested the involvement of hydrogen abstraction by coadsorbed O-2 as a faster process.									11	1	0	0	3	0	11				2691-3704		WOS:000656118100014	34467325

Bismuth-rich Bi-OX has improved stability and advantageous band structure compared to those of Bi-O-X and hence has attracted an increasing amount of research interest. In this work, ultrathin nanotubes of Bi5O7I with a 5 nm diameter and a 1 nm wall are obtained through a hydrothermal method while the phase and morphology of the products are regulated by the pH values and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) concentration of the reaction system, of which the products can be tuned from BiOI nanosheets to Bi5O7I nanobelts and ultrathin Bi5O7I nanotubes. PVP and pH control is important to the formation of the nanotubes as formation occurs via a PVP-guided oriented attachment from primary nanoparticles of Bi5O7I. The poorly crystalline and porous structure of the resultant bismuth-rich ultrathin nanotubes not only exposes more surface atoms but also exhibits a highly reduced conduction band minimum. The resultant band gap of 2.39 eV (as compared to 3.20 eV for the nanobelts) arises from the undercoordinated bismuth centers brought about by the rich oxygen vacancies in the nanotubes. The largely reduced band gap effectively enhances visible-light absorption, while the short charge-diffusion length of the nanotubes further reduces the charge-carrier loss in recombination.									26	0	0	0	4	0	26			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000480371400038	31305994

Experimental and kinetic model for lights-off tests in excess CO								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				209	1			126	134		10.1006/jcat.2002.3606				JUL 1 2002	2002	The adsorption of CO (1% CO/He mixture) at 300 K on a 2.9% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst leads to the detection of a strong IR band at 2075 cm(-1) associated with weak and broad IR bands in the range 1900-1700 cm(-1) ascribed to linear (denoted L) and multibound (bridged and threefold coordinated) CO species, respectively. In parts I and II of the present study it was shown that the L CO species is oxidized at T < 350 K according to the surface elementary step denoted S3, L + O-wads --> CO2, where O-wads is a weakly adsorbed oxygen species formed without competition with the L CO species by the dissociative chemisorption of O-2. In the present study the coverage of the L CO species as well as the conversion of CO into CO2 are determined during the increase in the reaction temperature T-r from 300 to 740 K (lighting-off tests) using several 1% CO/x% O-2/He mixtures, with x less than or equal to 0.5. In an excess of CO (x < 0.5), it is shown that the experimental curves theta(L) = f(T-r) can be fitted by a kinetic model by considering that theta(L) is determined by the equilibrium between the rates of adsorption, oxidation, and desorption of the L CO species. The parameters used in the kinetic model are those previously determined by studying (a) the adsorption equilibrium of the L CO species in the temperature range 300-740 K and (b) its oxidation by 02 at T < 350 K (in the absence of CO). The evolution of the experimental turnover frequency (TOFex) during the increase in T-r is determined and compared to the theoretical TOFth for low CO conversions. It is shown that TOFex = f(T-r) is in very good agreement with a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism via step S3, with the kinetic parameters used to fit the curves theta(L) f(T-r).

In this paper we discuss the implications of this assumption and the difficulty in reconciling it with experimental phenomena. We show how presenting chrono-amperometric transients as log-log plots for potentials steps in the presence and absence of an adlayer of carbon monoxide on polycrystalline platinum is particularly useful in understanding the time evolution of the CO oxidation reaction. When using log-log plots a clear power law decay can be observed in the transients both in the presence and absence of an adlayer of carbon monoxide. We explain this as an extension of current theory, such that the rate determining step in both cases is the formation of a hydrogen bonded water-OHads network, strongly influenced by anions, and that COads oxidation occurs, at least in part by the diffusion of OHads through this network. We hypothesize that, at low potentials the formation of OHads at active sites is fast and reversible but that transport of OHads away from those sites may be rate limiting. The assumption that overall OHads formation on platinum is fast and reversible is therefore highly dependent upon the platinum surface and the experimental conditions and it may not be appropriate for polycrystalline surfaces in sulfuric acid. Therefore, although the formation of OHads on platinum in the absence of strongly adsorbing anions on 'ideal' surfaces is almost certainly fast and reversible, on realistic fuel cell relevant surfaces under non-ideal conditions this assumption cannot be made, and instead the formation of an OHads adlayer may be somewhat slow and is associated with the formation of hydrogen bonded water-OHads networks on the surface. We expect this to be a more realistic description for what occurs during COads oxidation on fuel cell relevant catalysts which are highly heterogeneous and which have a highly defective surface.									35	2	0	0	1	0	36			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000256877200012	18563231	
J	Pirkarami, Azam; Rasouli, Sousan; Ghasemi, Ebrahim								Enhancing water splitting via weakening H-2 and O-2 adsorption on NiCo-LDH@CdS due to interstitial nitrogen doping: A close look at the mechanism of electron transfer								JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY				57				118	130		10.1016/j.jechem.2020.08.043		JAN 2021		JUN 2021	2021	This paper is a report on the development of a convenient approach to fabricating a very efficient hybrid photoelectrocatalyst for water splitting. This photoelectrocatalyst consists of nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide as the core, cadmium sulfide as the shell, and nitrogen, hence NiCo-LDH@CdS-N. For the electrocatalytic activity to be improved, the H-2 and O-2 binding energy needs to be weakened. The interstitial nitrogen doping on NiCo-LDH@CdS can increase electrocatalytic activity to a great extent. NiCoLDH@CdS nanoparticles are obtained by subjecting to nitriding the NiCo-LDH@CdS electrode coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone nanosheets. This electrode has a large specific surface area, allows fast transfer of electrons, and exhibits long-term stability. The experimental results presented in this paper reveal that interstitial nitrogen doping largely reduces H-2 and O-2 binding energy and lowers the activation barrier for the formation and splitting of water.

In particular, additions of 15 mol% of TiO2 give rise to composite materials constituted by 0.51 mol fraction titania-doped yttria tetragonal zirconia polycrystalline and 0.49 mol fraction titania-doped yttria stabilized zirconia (0.51 TiYTZP/0.49TiYSZ). Furthermore, Y-2(Ti1-yZry)(2)O-7 pyrochlore is present as an impurity phase with y close to 1, according to FT-Raman results. Lower and higher additions of titania than that of 15 mol%, i.e.,x=0, 5, 10,20, 25 and 30 mol% were considered to study the evolution of 8YSZ phase as a function of the TiO2 content. Furthermore, zirconium titanate phase (ZrTiO4) is detected when the titania content is equal or higher than 20 mol% and this phase admits Y2O3 in solid solution according to FE-SEM-EDX.The 0.51TiYTZP/0.49TiYSZ duplex material was selected in this study to establish the mechanism of its electronic conduction under low oxygen partial pressures. In the pO(2) range from 0.21 to 10(-7.5) atm. the conductivity is predominantly ionic and constant over the range and its value is 0.01 S/cm. The ionic plus electronic conductivity is 0.02 S/cm at 1000 degrees C and 10(-12.3) atm. Furthermore, the onset of electronic conductivity under reducing conditions exhibits a -1/4 pO(2) dependence. Therefore, it is concluded that the n-type electronic conduction in the duplex material can be due to a small polaron-hopping between Ti3+ and Ti4+. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we focus our discussion on tungsten oxide-based materials, one of our two principal topics of research in this field. After a description of pure WO3 physical, chemical and energetic properties we present our latest results on tungsten oxide PEC properties improvement. In our general approach, each component of the PEC electrode is addressed, from the absorber (bulk) to the surface energetics (near-surface) and catalysis (surface). Recently, progresses have been made on surface treatment for catalytic purposes as well as on PEC materials integration. In the case of catalytic treatment, our studies show that reactive sputtering technique is suitable to form high quality RuO2 thin films and nanoparticles. Tests conducted on RuO2 thin films pointed out an oxygen evolution reaction potential as low as 0.2 V. When used as an anode in 2-electrode configuration, RuO2 thin films lead to a photocurrent onset potential reduction as low as 500 mV for p-type PEC materials (CGSe(2) and a-SiC, so far tested) when compared to platinum. In the case of RuO2 nanoparticles, a photocurrent density increase of approx. 20% was observed on treated tungsten oxide films. Finally, we present a new integration scheme to increase photocurrent density using highly textured substrates (HTS). In our approach, HTS were obtained by anisotropic etching of [100] silicon substrates in KOH solution. Initial results indicated a very good coverage of WO3 onto the silicon pyramids and a photocurrent doubling is observed when compared to WO3 deposited on flat silicon substrates.

Graphene oxide (GO) was used as a precursor for covalent bonding of hexamethylenediamine (HMDA) molecules via the nucleophilic substitution/amidation reactions on epoxy (C-O-C) and carboxyl (-COOH) groups to yield hexamethylenediamine functionalized graphene oxide (GO-HMDA) with multiple binding chemistries such as oxygen and nitrogen. Afterwards, GO-HMDA was encapsulated in alginate hydrogel beads with different loadings 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt% to produce Alg/GO-HMDA hybrid adsorbents for the removal of trace heavy metal ions from aqueous solution. Batch adsorption studies showed remarkable adsorption rates reaching 100% for Pb (II), 98.18% for Cu (II) and 95.19 for Cd (II) (similar to 1 mg L-1) with only 15 wt% of GO-HMDA incorporated into the alginate beads. Moreover, Alg/GOHMDA showed high removal efficiencies of heavy metals from tap water with a removal order of (Pb > Cu > Cd) similar to that observed in single aqueous solution. In Addition, the Alg/GO-HMDA adsorbents displayed excellent regeneration ability for six consecutive adsorption-desorption cycles confirming the high performance and potential of these adsorbents, for real heavy metals remediation in environment and in drinking waters in both single and multiple systems. Finally, the adsorption mechanism of traces heavy metals resulted from several phenomena including the electrostatic interactions occurring between the -COOH groups of Alginate and the GO-HMDA surface groups as well as, through chelation interactions occurring between the metal cations and amino-functionalized groups of Alg/GO-HMDA 15 hybrid adsorbent.

After an overview, the presentation is divided into three major sections. In the first section, we consider thermal processes. The first process considered in this section is the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of SiO2 from TEOS (tetraethoxysilane). We discuss the use of film profile information to help decide between, and to help refine, kinetic models. The second example deals with thin film flow of doped glasses for planarization applications, and demonstrates model calibration. The second major section demonstrates the state of topography simulation for plasma processes. We demonstrate the use of physically motivated models that require calibration using experimental data for a given set of operating conditions. We first consider the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) of silicon dioxide from TEOS and oxygen mixtures (PETEOS). We then consider ionized physical vapor deposition (IPVD) of copper, incorporating results of new calculations on the interactions of gas phase-species with the surface. As the last example in this section, we discuss a reactive ion etch (RTE) model. The last major section presents four applications. First, programmed rate CVD is discussed in some detail, in order to demonstrate how feature scale modeling can be used in process development. Next, the RIE model is used to demonstrate aspect ratio-dependent etching, and to show how simulations can be used to develop engineering relationships. The third example shows how topography simulations can be used to aid process integration studies, and involves PETEOS, etching and reflow simulations. The fnal example uses the model for PETEOS to demonstrate the roles of '3d/2d' and '3d/3d' (transport dimensionality/surface dimensionality) topography simulators in 'virtual wafer fabs'.

Activation energies (E-a) for chalcopyrite dissolution in the presence of additives at 750 mV, derived using a modified 'time to a given fraction' method, demonstrate that E-a varies with reaction extent. The overall trend of evolution from interface- to transport controlled mechanism was independent of additive type or addition. This suggests that it is not primarily variation in the enthalpy of dissolution that controls the significant changes in relative dissolution rates on addition of additives. Rather, the relative dissolution rates on addition of aqueous cations are found to relate to the M-O framework volume (M and O being the cationic additive and oxygen within H2O in the first sphere of hydration, respectively). There is good inverse linear correlation between this volume and the relative dissolution rate per unit ionic strength which varies as K+ > Al3+ > no additive > Mg2+ > Na+ > Ca2+. It is proposed that this effect is related to the relative strength of hydration of the additives with the commensurate entropic effect on solute hydration being advantageous for chalcopyrite dissolution on K+ and Al3+ addition and detrimental for the other additives. R4SiO4, the dominant aqueous species upon Si addition under the conditions examined, has low affinity for water, resulting in a detrimental entropic contribution to solute hydration and dissolution. The effect of Fe addition on relative dissolution rate is convoluted by the role of Fe3+ as the primary oxidant for chalcopyrite dissolution. On addition of aqueous Fe to dissolution at 750 mV, the effect is detrimental due to the detrimental effect on the entropy of hydration of the solute and the relative abundance of Fe3+. At 650 mV the effect of the greater presence of Fe3+ due to Fe addition dominates and the dissolution rate is enhanced. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Light-induced changes in optical and EPR spectra of the mutants were measured to monitor the disappearance of the oxidized dimer upon electron donation by manganese in the presence of bicarbonate. The extent of electron transfer was strongly dependent upon the P/P+ midpoint potential. The midpoint potential of the Mn2+/Mn3+ couple was calculated to decrease linearly from 751 to 623 mV as the pH was raised from 8 to 10, indicating the involvement of a proton. The electron donation had a second order rate constant of approximately 9 x 10(4) M-1 s(-1), determined from the linear increase in rate for Mn2+ concentrations up to 200 muM. Weak dissociation constants of 100-200 muM were found. Quantitative EPR analysis of the six-line free Mn2+ signal revealed that up to seven manganese ions were associated with the reaction centers at a 1 mM concentration of manganese. The association and the electron transfer between manganese and the reaction centers could be inhibited by Ca2+ and Na+ ions. The ability of reaction centers with high potentials to oxidize manganese suggests that manganese oxidation could have preceded water oxidation in the evolutionary development of photosystem II.									31	0	1	0	20	0	34			0006-2960			WOS:000185447100017	12974637

Its basic structural unit is a layer of either triazine or heptazine cores consisting of C and N atoms, similar with a layer of hexagonal carbon rings of most of carbon materials. Fundamental synthesis process of g-C3N4 is pyrolysis of its precursors associated with different techniques, such as chemical vapor deposition, pressurizing, templating, doping, etc., as those applied for the synthesis of carbon materials. However, the properties of g-C3N4 are quite different from those of carbon materials; the former is hydrophilic but the latter is hydrophobic, and the former is photoactive for visible light but the latter isnon-active. Here, g-C3N4 is reviewed on its structure, synthesis, texture control and modification, and application with comparative discussion to carbon materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 397 patients were screened in the period June, 1997-June, 2000, and VRE were isolated from rectal swabs taken at admission, weekly, and when clinically indicated. The susceptibility of the enterococci was determined by the disk diffusion and broth dilution methods. The presence of vancomycin-resistance genes (vanA, vanB, and vanC) was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR); genetic clonality of isolates was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE); Tn1546 types were obtained by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of Tn1546 PCR fragments. Thirty-four strains, 31 identified as Enterococcus faecium and 3 strains as E. faecalis, were isolated from 12 of the 397 patients (3.0%); all strains were VanA as assessed by PCR and were resistant to the other antibiotics tested and showed high-level resistance to aminoglycosides. Enterococci isolated during the study period showed that different genetic backgrounds of strains, determined by PFGE combined with RFLP of Tn1546, are present in all the strains isolated in the study. PFGE type B was predominant in 1998 and 1999, and insertion sequence movements were found to have a role in the evolution of VanA resistance elements found in all strains. This study demonstrates that single patients may be colonized by closely related VRE with several PFGE types containing a wide variety of VanA elements. Moreover, isolates with identical PFGE types may contain different VanA elements reflecting rearrangements mediated by insertion sequences in VRE strains during their stay in the gastrointestinal tract.									16	0	0	0	11	5	16			1076-6294			WOS:000183480000011	12820805

The present study describes crystal structures and reactivity of wild-type and active site mutant TrzN enzymes. The homodimer native enzyme structure, solved to 1.40 angstrom resolution, is a (beta alpha)(8) barrel, characteristic of members of the amidohydrolase superfamily. TrzN uniquely positions threonine 325 in place of a conserved aspartate that ligates the metal in most mononuclear amidohydrolases superfamily members. The threonine side chain oxygen atom is 3.3 angstrom from the zinc atom and 2.6 angstrom from the oxygen atom of zinc-coordinated water. Mutation of the threonine to a serine resulted in a 12-fold decrease in k(cat)/K-m, largely due to k(cat),, whereas the T325D and T325E mutants had immeasurable activity. The structure and kinetics of TrzN are reminiscent of carbonic anhydrase, which uses a threonine to assist in positioning water for reaction with carbon dioxide. An isosteric substitution in the active site glutamate, E241Q, showed a large diminution in activity with ametryn, no detectable activity with atratone, and a 10-fold decrease with atrazine, when compared with wild-type TrzN. Activity with the E241Q mutant was nearly constant from pH 6.0 to 10.0, consistent with the loss of a proton-donating group. Structures for TrzN-E241Q were solved with bound ametryn and atratone to 1.93 and 1.64 angstrom resolution, respectively. Both structure and kinetic determinations suggest that the Glu(241) side chain provides a proton to N-1 of the s-triazine substrate to facilitate nucleophilic displacement at the adjacent C-2.									24	2	0	0	20	0	28				1083-351X		WOS:000282135500029	20659898

The obtained ACCN possesses narrower band gap compared to pure graphitic carbon nitride (CN), contributing to broader utilization region of visible light. It exhibits downshifted conduction band and valence band potential with the increased addition of AC. Carbon atoms replace the bridging nitrogen atoms in the framework of ACCN during calcination process, which greatly increase its electrical conductivity and charge separation efficiency. In addition, nitrogen defects and some carbon species linked to the introduced carbon atoms are detected in ACCN. They can also serve as electrons sink to promote the separation of electron-hole pairs. As a consequence, ACCN possesses improved redox ability in the degradation of sulfamethazine (SM2) under visible light. The removal ratio by optimal ACCN achieves 81% in 60 min and its reaction apparent rate constant (0.0277 min(-1)) is 6.6 times higher than that of CN (0.0042 min(-1)). Furtherly, the mechanism and reaction process during the photocatalytic degradation are studied specifically. This work provides a facile and green strategy to prepare nonmetal modified CN with boosting photo-redox ability for pollutants treatment.									23	2	0	0	9	0	24			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000503381200167

The resulting composite photoanode shows a generally enhanced photocurrent near the flat band potential region, and represents a 2.3 times improved photoconversion efficiency compared to that of pristine TiO2 in a neutral electrolyte. A negative effect on the photocurrent generation is also observed when loading TiO2 with a relatively thick Co-Pi layer, which is demonstrated to be due to the poor photohole transfer kinetics in the Co-Pi layer. Moreover, we find that Co-Pi can facilitate the photoelectrochemical performance of TiO2 over a wide pH range from 1-14. This improved activity is studied in detail by optical and electrochemical analyses. It is suggested that the mechanism of the overpotential-demanding water oxidation reaction is changed to a facile pathway by the Co-based electrocatalyst. At the same time, the more significant band bending is induced by the Co-Pi catalyst decreasing the charge recombination. This work provides a feasible route to reduce the external power needed to drive water splitting by coupling an electrocatalyst with a photocatalyst, as well as mechanistic insights important for other Co-Pi modified photoelectrodes for solar-driven water splitting.									110	2	0	0	6	0	110			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000352277500039	25804292

Two commercial lead anodes containing 0.56 and 0.69%Ag were studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to evaluate their electrochemical activity. An industrial acid zinc sulphate electrolyte containing glue and chloride ion, but without manganese addition, was considered. In this study, 5 h of electrolysis at a density of 50 mA cm(-2) (currently used in practice) and also 6 h of potential decay were made to represent electrowinning periods of maintenance both at 38 degrees C. During the 5 h polarisation, the average double layer capacity of Pb-0.56Ag alloy was higher (similar to 9%) than that of Pb-0.69Ag alloy. During the first hour of potential decay, the Warburg impedance controls the electrochemical reaction. For the period from the second to sixth hour, the double layer capacity decreased with immersion time, and the charge transfer resistance increased with time. During the potential decay, the average charge transfer resistance of Pb-0.69Ag anode was higher (similar to 52%) than that of Pb-0.56Ag anode.									9	1	0	0	0	0	10			1478-422X	1743-2782		WOS:000324526800008

Herein, this phenomenon was studied experimentally and theoretically. The study showed that the potential of the electrodes on either side of the bipolar plate (BP) changes according to the amount of the reverse charge flowing through the BP during shutdown. In addition, the potential of the electrodes of the middle BP changed relatively faster than that of the other BPs due to the increased reverse current of the middle BP. Moreover, effects of the operating parameters and electrode materials on the reverse current phenomenon are uncovered. The electrolyte circulation during shutdown as well as the high operating temperature increased the reverse current. However, the electrolysis current did not significantly affect the reverse current. Additionally, the origin of the reverse current is mainly the redox reactions of the electrodes during shutdown. Furthermore, the cathode that attached to a robust anode, on the same BP, is subject to more stressors. This study is useful for adapting the AWE to the dynamic operation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000795707900001

However, there are major barriers in construction of efficient and stable Si-based PEC cell, including low photovoltage, sluggish reaction kinetics, and poor stability in electrolytes. This review focuses on the strategies to solve these issues and summarizes recent progress. The working principles of PEC water splitting are first introduced. Then the strategies for improving Si-based photoelectrode performances are discussed, including (1) the regulation of Si surface morphology for enhancing light harvesting, (2) band structure engineering strategies to reduce recombination of photogenerated carriers, and (3) modification of protection layers for long stability and loading cocatalysts on Si-based photoelectrodes for accelerating water splitting. Lastly, we have presented some issues of Si-based photoelectrode materials, which should be addressed in future research.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5				2050-0505		WOS:000751844800001

In this work, a novel approach for facile and environmentally friendly synthesis of molybdenum phosphide (MoP) nanocrystals anchored on graphitized carbon is developed by one-step pyrolysis of a phosphorus-containing resin exchanged with Mo5+. A significant promotion effect of MoP on Pt in methanol electrooxidation is observed. The Pt-MoP/C catalyst exhibits ultrahigh electroactivity, and compared to commercial Pt/C, this catalyst reaches a-140 mV more negative onset potential and has 10 times the mass activity at 0.4 V vs. SCE and 5.1 times the peak mass activity. In addition, PtMoP/C has also excellent stability and CO tolerance, including a peak mass activity retention of 81.4% after 1000 cycles as compared to that of 51.6% on commercial Pt/C and a 140 mV more negative COad oxidation potential. The noteworthy promotion effect of MoP on Pt in methanol electrooxidation is also evaluated by theoretical calculations.									18	1	0	0	1	0	19			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000417712800018		
J	Xia, JR; Li, YJ; Zou, DH								Effects of salinity stress on PSII in Ulva lactuca as probed by chlorophyll fluorescence measurements								AQUATIC BOTANY				80	2			129	137		10.1016/j.aquabot.2004.07.006				OCT 2004	2004	Effects of salinity stress on photosystem II (PSII) performance in Ulva lactuca were investigated. Salinity stress (48-128parts per thousand) resulted in a significant decrease in photosynthetic O-2 evolution by 12.5%, 21.2%, 37.2% and 75.4% compared with the control treatment, whereas the contents of chlorophyll a, b and carotenoids during short-time (12 h) exposure were unaffected. The chl a fluorescence transients were recorded and analyzed according to the JIP-test which can quantify the PSII performance. The fluorescence yield at phase J, I and P markedly declined with increasing salinity and the transient almost reached a plateau at salinities higher than 64parts per thousand. Addition of 3-(3, 4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) led to a transformation of the O-J-I-P rise into an O-J rise. Salinity stress (at salinities higher than 64parts per thousand) induced a decrease by 1.4%, 35.9% and 50.1% in the maximum quantum yield of primary photochemistry (phi(Po)), by 34.3%, 56.1% and 49.8% in the quantum yield of electron transport (phi(Eo)), and by 53.9%, 40.8% and 73.2% in the efficiency with which a trapped exciton can move an electron into the electron transport chain further than Q(A)(-) (psi(o)) compared to the control. The total number of active reaction centers per absorption (RC/ABS) and the amount of active PSII reaction centers per excited cross section (RC/CS) also decreased by 45.7% and 70.8% when exposed to the highest salinity stress (128parts per thousand), respectively. These results indicated that the main targets in PSII that were affected by elevated salinity were inactivation of reaction centers and inhibition of the electron transport at the acceptor side of PSII.

However, studies pertaining to the haze in Changzhou are very limited, which makes it difficult to understand the characteristics and formation of winter haze in this area, and develop effective control measures. In this study, we carried out continuous online observation of particulate matter, chemical components, and meteorology in Changzhou in February 2017. Our results showed that haze pollution occurred frequently in Changzhou winter and exhibited two patterns: dry haze with low relative humidity (RH) and wet haze with high RH. Water-soluble inorganic ions (SO42-, NO3- , and NH4+) accounted for similar to 52.2% of the PM2.5 mass, of which sulfate was dominant in wet haze periods while nitrate was dominant in other periods. With the deterioration of haze pollution, the proportion of nitrate in PM2.5 increased, while sulfate proportion increased under wet haze and decreased under dry haze. Dry haze and wet haze appeared under slow north wind and south wind, respectively, and strong north wind or sea breeze scavenged pollution. We found that formation of nitrate occurred rapidly in daytime with high concentrations of odd oxygen (O-x = O-3 + NO2), whereas formation of sulfate occurred rapidly during nighttime with high RH, indicating that photochemistry and heterogeneous reaction were the major formation mechanisms for nitrate and sulfate, respectively. Through the cluster analysis of 36-h backward trajectories, five sources of air masses from three directions were identified. High PM2.5 concentrations (84.1 mu g m(-)(3) on average) usually occurred under the influence of two clusters (46%) from the northwest, indicating that regional transport from northern China aggravated the winter haze pollution in Changzhou. Emission reduction, particularly the mobile sources, and regional joint prevention and control can help to mitigate the winter haze in Changzhou.

A novel lead dioxide electrode doped with fluoride was investigated for wastewater treatment. The modified beta-PbO2, electrode showed high chemical stability and catalytic activity for contaminants abatement and organic mineralization. Evidence for active free radicals generation in electrochemical degradation was shown by electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR). 5,5-Dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) was used as spin trapping agent. The characteristic of hydroxyl radicals, 5,5-dimethyl-2-hydroxypyrrilidine-N-oxyI (DMPO-OH) spin adduct, was observed and the additions of hydroxyl radical scavengers reduce the signal of DMPO-OH. This indicated that hydroxyl radicals were indeed formed and played a critical role in water treatment. 4-Chlorophenol was chosen as model pollutant and the prepared electrode exhibited the perfect catalytic activity. The origin of the electrode and the structure of the anodic layer were examined to understand the mechanism of hydroxyl radical formation. The electrochemical reactions occurred at beta-PbO2 electrode was rather complex and involved the crystal-hydrated layer. It is the most environmentally friendly treatment method to use electrogenerated hydroxyl radicals as oxidants.									78	11	0	0	25	0	84			1932-7447			WOS:000245005900034

Operating conditions and parameters were found to influence in a challenging manner the morphology and electrochemical activity of the electrodeposited Ni-Co nanoparticles. The electrocatalytic properties of Ni-Co/carbon material-modified electrode toward the glucose oxidation were analyzed via cyclic voltammetry and amperometry. The studies showed that Ni-Co/MWNT electrode displayed the highest electrocatalytic activity, attributed to the high density of Ni-Co nanoparticles deposited on the carbon nanotubes support. A low detection limit of 1.8 mu M glucose with a good sensitivity of 1868 A mu A mM(-1) cm(-2) was obtained for electrochemical detection at Ni-Co deposited on MWNT.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000371793200001

Herein, by means of extensive density functional theory (DFT) computations, we proposed that a boron-interstitial (Bint)-doped C2N layer can act as a metal-free electrocatalyst for N-2 fixation and reduction to NH3. Our computations revealed that the Bint-doped C2N layer can sufficiently activate the N-2 molecule through the "acceptance-donation" process due to its significant positive charge and magnetic moment on the B dopant. In particular, the subsequent N-2 reduction reaction prefers to proceed via the enzymatic mechanism with a rather low limiting potential (-0.15 V), suggesting its superior catalytic performance for N-2 reduction. Importantly, the Bint-doped C2N layer possesses comparable stability to the experimentally available S-doped one and thus holds great promise for experimental synthesis. Thus, by carefully controlling the doping sites, the B-doped C2N layer can be utilized as a quite promising metal-free catalyst with high-efficiency for N-2 reduction, which may provide useful guidance for further facilitating sustainable NH3 synthesis.									132	7	0	0	5	0	129			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000457546000048

In this work, Ni-Fe-S is reported as a high performing anode material for the water splitting reaction, operating at low overpotentials and showing high apparent stability. Furthermore, Ni-Mo electrodes are developed on metallic foam substrates and optimized in terms of their performance. The Ni-Fe-S material as anode, combined and integrated with Ni-Mo as cathode in a cell configuration, splits water at 10 mA cm(-2) and a potential of 1.55 V. Similar to previous reports, we confirm that Mo leaches from Ni-Mo/Ni foam electrodes. Cycling tests and ICP-AES measurements show that the stability of Ni-Fe-S is apparent, and that in reality S is leaching from the material as was already suggested in literature. We expand on this knowledge and show that the leaching of S is dependent on both pH and the cation used during electrocatalysis. Furthermore, we find that applying an oxidative potential is in truth stabilizing towards S and that the alkalinity causes leaching. S was furthermore mobile and found to segregate towards the surface. Finally, using too low pH values (11 and lower) result in the passivating hydroxide metal layers being destroyed and the Ni-Fe-S dissolving completely.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000512433800001	31981396

The membrane not only displayed high conductivity ( > 10 mS cm(-1) at 30 degrees C), but possessed excellent thermal stability and mechanical properties. Alkali resistance test lasts 576 h in 1 M KOH at 80 degrees C, high retentions of IEC as well as conductivity and no obvious change in FTIR spectra suggest good alkaline resistance of SEBS-Pi membrane. Good three phase reaction boundary in catalyst layers and packing between the membrane and catalyst layers are formed when SEBS-Pi is used as both membrane and ionomer. A good performance of water electrolysis is achieved (400 mA cm(-2) at 2 V, 50 degrees C). During a long-term electrochemical stability test carried out with current density of 400 mA cm(-2) at 50 degrees C for 105 h, the voltage remained almost constant (around 2.08 V), indicating good cell durability. All these indicate that SEBS-Pi has a good potential for applications in water electrolysis.									32	2	0	0	1	0	34			0376-7388	1873-3123		WOS:000464546200027

Recently, several experimental observations have led to the proposal of a metalloradical catalytic cycle in which water oxidation occurs via hydrogen-atom abstraction by the tyrosyl radical from water bound to the manganese cluster. This model predicts a close proximity between the radical tyrosine, Y-z(.), and the Mn cluster and the involvement of the radical in a bifurcated hydrogen bond. Magnetic resonance techniques have been used in this work to probe the interaction of the tyrosyl radical with its environment in PSII samples in which the catalytic cycle is blocked by acetate treatment and the enzyme is trapped in a paramagnetic S2Yz. state. Radical interaction with the metal cluster has been studied via simulations of the EPR spectra obtained for this state. The simulations were based on a radical-pair model and included terms for both electron-electron dipolar and exchange interactions. The results show a dominant exchange interaction between the radical and the manganese cluster in these preparations and led to an estimate of 8-9 Angstrom for the spin-spin distance. ESEEM spectroscopy and (H2O)-H-1/(H2O)-H-2 exchange were used to study interactions of the S2Yz. state with exchangeable hydrogen nuclei in the site. Two-pulse ESEEM data show features expected for a radical-pair species, in support of our analysis of the continuous-wave EPR spectrum. An ESEEM analysis based on an electron spin 1/2, nuclear spin 1 model shows that both two- and three-pulse ESEEM data are consistent with four deuterons that exhibit an electron-nuclear dipole-dipole coupling of 0.42 MHz.

Compared with bulk g-C3N4 (BCN), the as-synthesized defective CN microrods with an increased specific surface area exhibit an enhanced photocatalytic performance with a kinetic constant (K) of ~0.19 min-1 for RhB degradation and an ~718.36 mu mol g-1h-1 for H2O2 production rate, which are about~17-fold and ~3-fold higher than that of BCN, respectively. The C, N dual vacancies are very effective in reducing the bandgap and inhibiting carrier recombination. The pivotal active species in RhB degradation is determined to bemiddotO(2)-, and the pathway of H(2)O(2 & nbsp;)production is confirmed as a sequential two-step single-electron reduction. The results have provided a great potential way to promote the practical application of CN for photocatalytic organic pollutant removal and H2O2 production. (C)& nbsp;2022 Elsevier B.V.

JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				8	5			2286	2322		10.1039/c9ta12799b				FEB 7 2020	2020	The status of photocatalytic (PC)/photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting as a promising approach to solar-to-chemical energy conversion has increased significantly over the past several decades for addressing the energy shortage. However, the overall energy conversion efficiency is still relatively poor due to the severe photocorrosion in photosensitive semiconductors. Herein, the review begins with the discussion of the photocorrosion mechanism with several typical semiconductors as examples. Then the feasible characterization methods used to evaluate the stability of semiconductors are summarized. Notably, most studies regarding water splitting focus on achieving high efficiency by improving the charge separation and transfer efficiency within the semiconductors. This review focuses on the recent advances in effective strategies for photocorrosion inhibition of semiconductor-based composites with respect to their intrinsic properties and interface charge transfer kinetics, including morphology/size control, heteroatom doping, heterojunction construction, surface modification, and reaction environment regulation. Furthermore, an in-depth investigation of photocorrosion pathways and mechanisms is critical to accurately and effectively address the photocorrosion of semiconductor-based composites to improve PC/PEC water splitting performance in the future.									142	8	0	0	10	0	143			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521200000004

In order to enhance the stability of photocatalytic degradation of Ag-based photocatalysts, here, the Ag2O/Ag2CO3 heterojunction was in-situ constructed and conveniently regulated by controlling the alkalinity of room temperature solid-state chemical reaction system. The photocatalytic degradation activity of the obtained heterojunction was influenced by the in-situ regulated component and band position of the Ag2O/Ag2CO3 heterojunction. The obtained optimal products AAC-6 displayed remarkable photocatalytic activity and high reusability. The apparent rate constant of AAC-6 is 20 times than that of Ag2CO3, it is also far higher than that of P25. The significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance can be ascribed to the matching energy position between Ag2CO3 and Ag2O, which can facilitate the visible light absorption ability and the efficient separation of photoinduced charges carriers. This study explored an in-situ one-step solid-state strategy to construct Ag2CO3-based heterojunction catalyst with outstanding photocatalytic performance, which may open a new perspective for the preparation of excellent photocatalytic degradation materials by solid-state chemical method.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000476961800011

However, the short lifetime still remained as one of the bottle-neck obstacles for the practical application of rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries. The development of efficient cathode catalyst is highly desirable to reduce the energy barrier of Li-O-2 reaction and electrode failure. In this work, we report a facile strategy for the fabrication of a high-performance cathode catalyst for rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries by the encapsulation of high content of active Fe nanorods into N-doped carbon nanotubes with high stability (denoted as Fe@NCNTs). First-principles calculations reveal that the synergistic charge transfer and redistribution between the interface of Fe nanorods, the CNT walls and the active N dopants greatly facilitate the chemisorption and subsequent dissociation of O2 molecules into the epoxy intermediates on the carbon surface, which benefits the uniform growth of nanosized discharge products on CNT surface and thus boosts the reversibility of Li-O-2 reactions. As a result, the cathode with Fe@NCNT catalyst exhibits long cycling stability with high capacities (1000 mA h g(-1) for 160 cycles and 600 mA h g(-1) for 270 cycles). Based on the total mass of Fe@NCNTs + Li2O2, high gravimetric energy densities of 2120-2600 W h kg(-1) can be achieved at the power densities of 50-795 W kg(-1).									23	5	0	0	1	0	23			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000401870300005

Unexpectedly, the resulting porous In2S3@In2O3 composites were discovered to display a broad visible-light response and especially enhanced capacities for efficient photocatalytic production of H2O2 in pure water, with a rate of 4.59 mu mol.g(-1).min(-l). An apparent quantum yield of 28.9% at 420 nm can also be expected without the use of noble metals or organic scavengers. Herein, the high light utilization might be profited from their porous tubular heterostructure for powerful "light captivity". Moreover, the Ar plasma-derived O-v sites on the composites might tune the H2O2 generation route from the single-electron reduction to the two-electron one toward the significantly enhanced photocatalysis, as validated by the Koutecky-Levich plots. This work demonstrates a new perspective of designing porous heterostructures with the advantages of high light harvest and plasma-derived O-v active sites. Importantly, it may provide a promising defect-induced strategy of two-electron reduction triggered by the plasma treatment for the efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production under visible light.									15	1	0	0	4	0	15			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000662086600027	34047545

The repertoire of flux responses that the metabolic network can display in different external conditions may be quantified applying flux variability analysis to genome-scale metabolic reconstructions.Results: A procedure is developed to classify and quantify the sources of flux variability. We apply the procedure to the latest Escherichia coli metabolic reconstruction, in glucose minimal medium, with an additional constraint to account for the mechanism coordinating carbon and nitrogen utilization mediated by alpha-ketoglutarate. Flux variability can be decomposed into three components: internal, external and growth variability. Unexpectedly, growth variability is the only significant component of flux variability in the physiological ranges of glucose, oxygen and ammonia uptake rates. To obtain substantial increases in metabolic flexibility, E. coli must decrease growth rate to suboptimal values. This growth-flexibility trade-off gives a straightforward interpretation to recent work showing that most overall cell-to-cell flux variability in a population of E. coli can be attained sampling a small number of enzymes most likely to constrain cell growth. Importantly, it provides an explanation for the global reorganization occurring in metabolic networks during adaptations to environmental challenges. The calculations were repeated with a pathogenic strain and an old reconstruction of the commensal strain, having less than 50% of the reactions of the latest reconstruction, obtaining the same general conclusions.Conclusions: In E. coli growing on glucose, growth variability is the only significant component of flux variability for all physiological conditions explored. Increasing flux variability requires reducing growth to suboptimal values. The growth-flexibility trade-off operates in physiological and evolutionary adaptations, and provides an explanation for the global reorganization occurring during adaptations to environmental challenges. The results obtained do not rely on the knowledge of kinetic and regulatory details of the system and are highly robust to incomplete or incorrect knowledge of the reaction network.									10	0	0	0	9	0	10			1752-0509			WOS:000338580800001	24927772	
J	Huang, Xubo; Chen, Min; Wang, Yaru; Chen, Chen; Xu, Yiming								Amorphous NiSn and FeOOH as bifunctional co-catalysts for oxygen reduction and phenol (water) oxidation over BiVO4 under visible light								JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS				421						126650	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126650		JUL 2021		JAN 5 2022	2022	Monoclinic BiVO4 (BiV) has been widely used as a photoanode for water oxidation, but rarely as a photocatalyst for organic oxidation due to slow reaction of O2. In this work, BiV has been modified with poorly crystallized sFe and sNi, where sFe is FeOOH, and sNi is a mixture of Ni(OH)2 and polysulfide. Under light, sFe/BiV and sNi/BiV in aqueous solution were more active than BiV, respectively, not only for phenol oxidation but also for O2 reduction. Importantly, the rate of phenol oxidation obtained for sFe/sNi/BiV was larger than the sum of the rates measured for sFe/BiV and sNi/BiV, by a factor of approximately 1.5. Moreover, on a film electrode, O2 reduction had a current of sFe/sNi/BiV > sNi/BiV > sFe/BiV > BiV, while water (photo)oxidation had a current of sFe/sNi/BiV > sNi/BiV > sFe/BiV > BiV. A possible mechanism is proposed, involving formation of a reduced sulfur species for O2 reduction and an oxidized iron species for phenol oxidation. In sFe/sNi/BiV, there is a mutual promotion between the sNi-mediated electron transfer and the sFe-mediated hole transfer. This results in a further improved efficiency of charge separation for O2 reduction and phenol oxidation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000696926600005	34330078

Electrocatalytic N(2)reduction (NRR) is considered a prospective way for ammonia production at ambient conditions. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) metal-free materials are emerging as highly efficient and robust electrocatalysts for NRR owing to their advanced features: highly exposed surface, abundant active sites, tunable electronic states, and long-term stability compared to metal-based and bulk catalysts. In this minireview, we briefly summarize the latest edge reports on 2D metal-free materials catalyzed NRR. Also, we discuss the challenges and perspectives on the design and synthesis of novel 2D metal-free catalysts.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			2296-2646			WOS:000543880000001	32587846

The occurrence of leukocytes has been documented in CIN; however, their role in VEGF production remains unknown. Oxidative stress has been involved in the progression of malignant neoplasias, but to the authors' knowledge tissue oxidative stress in CIN has not been documented. The objective of the current study was to investigate the expression of VEGF, leukocyte infiltration, leukocyte VEGF expression, and nitrogen/oxygen metabolism in cervical tissues from patients with CIN. METHODS: Indirect immunofluorescence was used to study the expression of VEGF and leukocyte infiltration in cervical samples from 55 patients with CIN and 7 normal controls. Superoxide anion (O-2(-)) expression was determined by a cytochemical method, and tissue and serum nitric oxide by the Griess reaction. Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA and HPV types were identified by the hybrid capture 2 HPV DNA test. RESULTS: Increased expression of VEGF was observed related to the progression of CIN. A significant increment of CD3 lymphocytes was found in CIN type 3 (CIN 3) and coexpression of CD3/VEGF and monocyte-macrophage/VEGF in CIN 2 and 3. Increased O-2(-)-positive cells were found in CIN 2 and 3; however, tissue nitrate-nitrite content remained similar to controls. The incidence of HPV infection was 16% in patients with CIN. No significant differences were observed in the values of HPV-positive or HPV-negative patients. CONCLUSIONS: Different factors leading to cervical neoplasia progression may be involved in the evolution of CIN, and the presence of these factors is most likely not related to the HPV infection status.

Grimm, Robert/0000-0002-7588-1194			The potential for lithoautotrophic life on Mars: Application to shallow interfacial water environments								ASTROBIOLOGY				7	2			342	354		10.1089/ast.2007.0124				APR 2007	2007	We developed a numerical model to assess the lithoautotrophic habitability of Mars based on metabolic energy, nutrients, water availability, and temperature. Available metabolic energy and nutrient sources were based on a laboratory-produced Mars-analog inorganic chemistry. For this specific reference chemistry, the most efficient lithoautotrophic microorganisms would use Fe(2+) as a primary metabolic electron donor and NO(3)(-) or gaseous O(2) as a terminal electron acceptor. In a closed model system, biomass production was limited by the electron donor Fe(2+) and metabolically required P, and typically amounted to similar to 800 pg of dry biomass/ml (similar to 8,500 cells/ml). Continued growth requires propagation of microbes to new fecund environments, delivery of fresh pore fluid, or continued reaction with the host material. Within the shallow cryosphere-where oxygen can be accessed by microbes and microbes can be accessed by exploration-lithoautotrophs can function within as little as three monolayers of interfacial water formed either by*adsorption from the atmosphere or in regions of ice stability where temperatures are within some tens of degrees of the ice melting point. For the selected reference host material (shergottite analog) and associated inorganic fluid chemistry, complete local reaction of the host material potentially yields a time-integrated biomass of similar to 0.1 mg of dry biomass/g of host material (similar to 109 cells/g). Biomass could also be sustained where solutes can be delivered by advection (cryosuction) or diffusion in interfacial water; however, both of these processes are relatively inefficient. Lithoautotrophs in near-surface thin films of water, therefore, would optimize their metabolism by deriving energy and nutrients locally. Although the selected chemistry and associated model output indicate that lithoautotrophic microbial biomass could accrue within shallow interfacial water on Mars, it is likely that these organisms would spend long periods in maintenance or survival modes, with instantaneous biomass comparable to or less than that observed in extreme environments on Earth.									20	0	0	0	13	0	20			1531-1074			WOS:000246680700005	17480165

Beyond their traditional biological applications, hydrogels are emerging as an appealing materials platform for energy- and water-related applications owing to their attractive and tailorable physiochemical properties. In this review, we highlight the highly tunable synthesis of various hydrogels, involving key synthetic elements such as monomer/polymer building blocks, cross-linkers, and functional additives, and discuss how hydrogels can be employed as precursors and templates for architecting three-dimensional frameworks of electrochemically active materials. We then present an in-depth discussion of the structure-property relationships of hydrogel materials based on fundamental gelation chemistry, ultimately targeting properties such as enhanced ionic/electronic conductivities, mechanical strength, flexibility, stimuli-responsiveness, and desirable swelling behavior. The unique interconnected porous structures of hydrogels enable fast charge/mass transport while offering large surface areas, and the polymer-water interactions can be regulated to achieve desirable water retention, absorption, and evaporation within hydrogels. Such structure- derived properties are also intimately coordinated to realize multifunctionality and stability for different target devices. The plethora of stimulating examples is expounded with a focus on batteries, supercapacitors, electrocatalysts, solar water purification, and atmospheric water harvesting, which showcase the unprecedented technological potential enabled by hydrogels and hydrogel-derived materials. Finally, we study the challenges and potential ways of tackling them to reveal the underlying mechanisms and transform the current development of hydrogel materials into sustainable energy and water technologies.									278	12	0	0	41	0	283			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000562192900010	32639747

The influence of the reaction temperature and time on the activities of the catalysts and the morphology of particles was investigated. The results showed that the catalysts exhibited strong absorption in visible light region. It was found that the photocatalyst prepared under hydrothermal condition at 140 degrees C for about 24 h showed good crystallinity with regular shape, and the highest activity for hydrogen production under visible light irradiation in an aqueous Na2S-Na2SO3 solution. The reason for its better performance has been discussed in detail. (C) 2010 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this work, we report the novel CdS/CoMoSx core-shell nanowires (CCMS NWs) prepared by a facile in situ synthesis method. The in situ growth of amorphous CoMoSx shell on the surface of CdS NWs core efficiently promoted the photocatalytic H2 evolution under visible light irradiation. The optimized CCMS sample containing 15 mol% CoMoSx (CCMS-15) achieves a H2 evolution rate as high as 477.96 mu mol.h(-1) under visible light irradiation, up to 26.3 times over bare CdS (18.2 mu mol.h(-1)). Moreover, the constructed core-shell CdS/CoMoSx photocatalyst shows a long-term stability without noticeable activity degradation. Based on the detailed analyses of PL, UV-vis DRS, transient photocurrent responses, EIS, Mott-Schottky plots and ESR, the significantly enhanced activity is ascribed to the synergistic effect of increased visible light absorption, suppressed photo-generated charge carries recombination and the amorphous defective structure of CoMoSx cocatalyst. In consideration of its facile synthesis, low cost, and superior performance, the amorphous CoMoSx appears to be promising co-catalyst for photocatalytic water splitting.					25th Congress of International-Federation-for-Heat-Treatment-and-Surface-Engineering (IFHTSE)25th Congress of International-Federation-for-Heat-Treatment-and-Surface-Engineering (IFHTSE)	SEP 11-14, 2018SEP 11-14, 2018	Int Federat Heat Treatment & Surface Engn; Chinese Heat Treatment SocInt Federat Heat Treatment & Surface Engn; Chinese Heat Treatment Soc	Xian, PEOPLES R CHINAXian, PEOPLES R CHINA	29	2	0	0	0	0	29			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000487851700068

In this work, well-aligned, hierarchical zinc-iron layered double hydroxide (LDH) is in situ synthesized on the surface of TiO2 by a facile and effective photo-assisted electrodeposition(PED) method. An experimental-computational combination study reveals that the photogenerated holes of TiO2 tend to travel to ZnFe-LDH which enhances the bulk charge separation; while ZnFe-LDH acts as a cocatalyst which accelerates the surface water oxidation reaction. The resulting TiO2/ZnFe-LDH-PE photoanode exhibits a largely enhanced PEC performance: the photocurrent density at 1.0 V vs. RHE is 2.29 and 1.31 times higher than that of the pristine TiO2 and TiO2/ZnFe-LDH-E (prepared by a conventional electrosynthesis method) photoanode, with 150 mV and 50 mV of negative shift for onset potential. This can be ascribed to the enhanced interface interaction and highly-matched band structure between ZnFe-LDH and TiO2. It is expected that this strategy can be extended to other heterostructures for advanced performance in the fields of energy conversion and storage.									111	10	0	0	7	0	113			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000397314200003

This perspective article describes the barrier, progress and future direction of research on the correlation of the chemical constituent, size, dimensionality, architecture, crystal structure, microstructure and electronic band structure of photocatalysts (or photoelectrodes) with five vital processes including light absorption, charge separation, migration and recombination as well as surface redox reactions. This article deals with both single materials and composites such as co-catalysts on photoelectrodes/photocatalysts, dye-sensitized or plasmon-enhanced photocatalysts, semiconductor-semiconductor heterostructures, semiconductor-carbon hybrids as wells as Z-scheme and tandem cells. This article also highlights the application of representative photocatalysts and PECs in solar water splitting.									666	28	0	0	40	1	670			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000350685400002

BS DFT computations for the Ru complexes have elucidated that the closed-shell structure (2b) Ru(II)-Q complex is less stable than the open-shell structure (2bb) consisting of Ru(III) and semiquinone (SQ) radical fragments. These computations have also elucidated eight different electronic and spin structures of tetraradical intermediates that may be generated in the course of water splitting reaction. The Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian model for these species has been derived to elucidate six different effective exchange interactions (J) for four spin systems. Six J values have been determined using total energies of the eight (or seven) BS solutions for different spin configurations. The natural orbital analyses of these BS DFT solutions have also been performed in order to obtain natural orbitals and their occupation numbers, which are useful for the lucid understanding of the nature of chemical bonds of the Ru complexes. Implications of the computational results are discussed in relation to the proposed reaction mechanisms of water splitting reaction in artificial photosynthesis systems and the similarity between artificial and native water splitting systems.									45	1	0	0	7	0	45			0027-8424			WOS:000309604500022	22761310

Apparent colours of the betalains were bleached by the addition of ONOO(-), and the absorbance decreases were suppressed in the presence of glutathione, a ONOO(-) scavenger. After bleaching, a new absorption maximum was observed at 350 nm in the spectrum of the resulting reaction mixture. New peaks were detected from HPLC analysis of the reaction products of betanin, a representative constituent of red beetroot betacyanins, treated with ONOO(-) monitoring at 350 nm, and the intensity of the major peak was positively correlated with ONOO(-) concentration. Betanin inhibited the ONOO(-) (0.5 mM)-dependent nitration of tyrosine (0.1 mM). Additionally, the IC(50) value of betanin (19.2 mu M) was lower than that of ascorbate (79.6 mu M). The presence of betanin (0.05-1.0 mM) also inhibited ONOO(-) (0.5 mM)-dependent DNA strand cleavage in a concentration -dependent manner. These results suggest that betalains can protect cells from nitrosative stress in addition to protecting them from oxidative stresses.									30	0	0	0	17	0	31			1071-5762			WOS:000297814900012	22087762

Herein, a near-ideal plasmon-mediated photocatalyst system is developed. Au/CdSe nanocrystal clusters (NCs) are successfully fabricated through a facile emulsion-based self-assembly approach, containing Au nanoparticles (NPs) of size 2.8, 4.6, 7.2, or 9.0 nm and CdSe quantum dots (QDs) of size approximate to 3.3 nm. Under visible-light irradiation, the Au/CdSe NCs with 7.2 nm Au NPs afford very stable operation and a remarkable H-2-evolution rate of 73 mmol g(CdSe)(-1)h(-1) (10x higher than bare CdSe NCs). Plasmon resonance energy transfer from the Au NPs to the CdSe QDs, which enhances charge-carrier generation in the semiconductor and suppresses bulk recombination, is responsible for the outstanding photocatalytic performance. The approach used here to fabricate the Au/CdSe NCs is suitable for the construction of other plasmon-mediated photocatalysts.									264	27	0	0	24	0	267			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000405410700022	28497896	
J	Kim, Ju Hyeong; Park, Gi Dae; Kang, Yun Chan								Novel synthetic strategy for a nanostructured metal hydroxysulfide-C and its initial electrochemical investigation as a new anode material for potassium-ion batteries								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH				46	5			6323	6336		10.1002/er.7570		DEC 2021		APR 2022	2022	Efforts have been made to develop highly promising electrode materials for K-ion batteries (KIBs) by exploring new compositions, stable nanostructures, and combinations of various carbonaceous materials to overcome the slow reaction dynamics of K-ion. Recently, multiple anionic anode materials, such as metal hydroxychlorides, metal hydroxycarbonates, and metal hydroxysulfides, which contain metal-OH bonds, have caught attention as anode materials for Li- and Na-ions batteries owing to their ability to enhance the overall electrochemical kinetics by forming intrinsic electric fields at nanoscale heterointerfaces. Herein, a new synthetic strategy for metal hydroxysulfide@C yolk-shell nanosphere was introduced, and the electrochemical reaction mechanism between the metal hydroxysulfide and K-ion was initially investigated by rational structural and electrochemical analyses. This work synthesized yolk-shell nanospheres having a configuration of metal hydroxide@void@metal hydroxide-C by water-vapor-assisted heat treatment without requiring a strong alkali solution. Cobalt hydroxide@C nanospheres were finally transformed into cobalt hydroxysulfide@C yolk-shell nanospheres through a room-temperature sulfidation process. The metal hydroxysulfide transformed into a heterostructured nanocomposite consisted of metal hydroxide and metal sulfide following the initial cycle. The rationally nanostructured cobalt hydroxysulfide@C electrode exhibited high-rate capability (138.0 mA h g(-1) at 5.0 A g(-1)) and long-term cycling stability (158.4 mA g(-1) at 1.0 A g(-1) following 300 cycles) in KIBs.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000730608600001

Agriculture and Life Sciences				39	6			600	606	1008-9209(2013)39:6<600:HZNJYQ>2.0.TX;2-V					2013	2013	Rainbow trout belongs to Salmonidae aerobic fish,and it is necessary for high dissolved oxygen content of living water environment.If the dissolved oxygen content of living water is less than 5 mg/L,it will cause the increase of respiratory rate,which is the so-calledaquaculture floating headphenomenon.Because the fish lives in hypoxia environment and the 90% oxygen consumption is in the mitochondria,the transmission mechanism in composition and electronic respiratory chain may be different from the terrestrial animal.At the mitochondrial inner membrane,electrons from NADH and succinate pass through the electron transport chain to oxygen,which is reduced to water.Complex I is one of the main sites at which premature electron leakage to oxygen occurs,thus being one of the main sites of production of harmful superoxide.The first isolation of mitochondrial complex I since 1 961,its composition and structure have had a primary understanding,but the specific mechanism of its participation in respiration,especially the function of each subunit is not clear.The protein encoded by Ndufb2 gene is a subunit of the multisubunit NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase(complex I). Mammalian complex I is composed of 45 different subunits.This protein has NADH dehydrogenase activity and oxidoreductase activity.It plays an important role in transferring electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) methods were used for the isolation of the whole cDNA of Ndufb2 gene from brain of Oncorhynchus mykiss. The assembly taskes of 3′ and 5′-RACE sequence were completed by DNAman program. A pair of gene specific primers were designed to amplify the full-length cDNA sequence. ClustalX 1.81 and MEGA 3.0 software were used to calculate the amino acid sequence differences, and then the phylogenetic relationships of rainbow trout Ndufb2 gene sequence with other species were analyzed. Protein phosphorylation sites and protein kinase phosphorylation sites were predicted using online software NetPhosK 1 and NetPhos 2.Sequence analysis results showed that the rainbow trout Ndufb2 cDNA was 899 bp in length, 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) 152 bp, 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) 441 bp, open reading frame (ORF) 306 bp, encoding 101 amino acids. The protein molecular mass was 11.4 ku and isoelectric point was 5.31. This gene sequence had been submitted to the GenBank database (accession number: FJ534641). Mitochondrial target sequence of 50 amino acid motif appeared from the 1st to 50th amino acid site. Two antigenic sites (65-ILWHCWHDPD-74 and 23-QKIVIRK-29) of the Ndufb2 protein were found, and one serine phosphorylation site (aa49), two threonine phosphorylation sites (aa15, aa47) and seven kinase phosphorylation sites were also found. Sequence alignment exhibited 98% identity of amino acids between O. mykiss and Salmo salar, and more than 55% identity of amino acids between O. mykiss and mammal. Phylogenetic tree showed that the Ndufb2 of rainbow trout had the closest relationship with those of Atlantic salmon and zebrafish, then the amphibians, birds, marsupials and mammals. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the constructed Ndufb2 protein phylogenetic tree was consistent with the traditional species classification tree.The above results indicate that the Ndufb2 gene is relatively conservative in the progress of evolution and play an important role in electron transport process of mitochondrial respiratory chain. The cloned full-length cDNA sequence of mitochondrial respiratory chain gene Ndufb2 of rainbow trout lays a theoretical foundation for the structure and function of clarifying fish mitochondrial complex I.			从虹鳟鱼(Oncorhynchus mykiss)的脑组织中提取 RNA,经逆转录聚合酶链反应及 cDNA 末端快速扩增技术克隆出 Ndufb2基因全长 cDNA 序列(GenBank 登录号:FJ534641),并对其序列进行分析。扩增结果表明:Ndufb2基因的 cDNA 序列全长899 bp,其中5'端非翻译区长152 bp,3'端非翻译区长441 bp,开放阅读框长306 bp,编码101个氨基酸;其 N 端前50个氨基酸为线粒体靶序列。将翻译的虹鳟 Ndufb2蛋白序列与大西洋鲑(Salmo salar)的 Ndufb2蛋白序列比对发现,其同源性高达98%,且虹鳟 Ndufb2蛋白序列与已报道的哺乳动物的 Ndufb2蛋白序列同源性均在55%以上。表明 Ndufb2基因在进化过程中是高度保守的,推测其在线粒体呼吸链组成中发挥着重要作用。						0	0	0		0	0	0			1008-9209			CSCD:5020514

The amount of phosphorus varied in order to obtain iron phosphides with different stoichiometry. Catalysts containing Fe 2 P, FeP and FeP 2 phases were obtained. The textural and structural properties of the prepared catalysts were evaluated by using different experimental techniques such as N 2 adsorption -desorption at -196 ?C, X-ray diffraction (XRD), M?ssbauer spectroscopy, high resolution trans- mission spectroscopy (HRTEM), infrared spectroscopy (IR) of adsorbed CO at low temperature, X-ray photo- electron microscopy (XPS) and NH 3 thermoprogrammed desorption (NH 3 -TPD). The catalytic activity was stu- died at 275 ?C and at 15 and 5 bar of hydrogen pressure in the hydrodeoxygenation reaction of phenol. Characterization results evidenced that the initial P/Fe ratio employed in the synthesis not only governed the stoichiometry of the iron phosphide, but also the particle size, metallic surface exposure and acidity. The cat- alysts presenting unique phases were those presenting better activity in the HDO reaction of phenol. Moreover, Fe 2 P phase presented better results than FeP in terms of HDO conversion.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000544088700014

In this work, the mechanisms, onset potentials and activity for electrooxidation of methanol were studied on a series of Pt-modified WC catalysts where the bare W-terminated WC(0001) substrate was employed. In the surface energy calculations of a series of Pt-modified WC models, we found that the feasible structures are mono-and bi-layer Pt-modified WCs. The tri-layer Pt-modified WC model is not thermodynamically stable where the top layer Pt atoms tend to accumulate and form particles or clusters rather than being dispersed as a layer. We further calculated the mechanisms of methanol oxidation on the feasible models via methanol dehydrogenation to CO involving C-H and O-H bonds dissociating subsequently, and further CO oxidation with the C-O bond association. The onset potentials for the oxidation reactions over the Pt-modified WC catalysts were determined thermodynamically by water dissociation to surface OH* species. The activities of these Pt-modified WC catalysts were estimated from the calculated kinetic data. It has been found that the bi-layer Pt-modified WC catalysts may provide a good reactivity and an onset oxidation potential comparable to pure Pt and serve as promising electrocatalysts for DMFCs with a significant decrease in Pt usage.									41	2	0	0	1	2	43			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000361697400073	26351805

In this work, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) supported PtCo alloys catalysts with improved MOR properties and anti-CO poisoning ability are successfully prepared by integrating low temperature adsorption and high temperature reduction method. The Pt1Co3@NC/MWCNTs sample with moderate Co2+ feeding content (0.81 mA/ug(Pt)) achieves a factor of 1.93 enhancement in MOR mass activity compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.42 mA/ug(Pt)). In addition, the Pt1Co3@NC/MWCNTs sample displays a lower CO oxidation onset potential respect to pristine Pt/C catalyst (0.74 V vs. 0.82 V). Scuh improvement of MOR activity, durability and anti-CO poisoning ability of the Pt1Co3@NC/MWCNTs catalyst is ascribed to the moderate surface compositions, optimal electronic interaction between PtCo alloys and MWCNTs, and the protection of N-doped carbon (NC) shells. This study provides a new direction to decrease the utilization of platinum and improve the MOR activity, stability and anti-CO poisoning ability of electrocatalysts which will be potential in design and fabrication of the highly efficient electrocatalysts for DMFCs applications.

J	Fan, DY; Han, T; Li, J; Wang, Q; Gao, RF				Fan, Dayong/G-4654-2013				Profile of absolute light utilization efficiency within leaves of Euonymus japonicus								ACTA BOTANICA SINICA				45	2			169	176						FEB 2003	2003	Absolute light utilization efficiency across leaf section of Euonymus japonicus T. was calculated based on the measurements of photoacoustic technique (PA technique) and microscopic fiber optic probe. This new method was based on the principal of depth analysis by PA technique and the differential analysis of light gradients across leaf section by micro-optical probe technique. The depth analysis was shown by a sample of PA scan light absorption spectra. Results showed that the tissue layers between palisade tissue and spongy tissue used the smallest proportion of incident light energy for photochemical reactions (about 0.026% incident light energy of 660 nm light), while in tissue layer more close to the adaxial surface of leaf or the abaxial surface of leaf, the efficiency of utilization of light energy tended to be improved, e. g. 0.092% for tissue layers close to adaxial surface; 0.036% for tissue layers close to abaxial surface. The results that different leaf tissue layers utilized different proportion of incident light energy for photochemical reaction directly prove the hypothesis put forward by Han and Vogelmann.									2	2	0	0	1	0	3			0577-7496			WOS:000181190200009

Herein, we report an electrocatalytic water oxidation reaction with Mn-III tris(pentafluorophenyl)corrole (1) in propylene carbonate (PC). O-2 was generated at the Mn-V/IV potential with hydroxide, but a more anodic potential was required to evolve O-2 with only water. With a synthetic Mn-V(O) complex of 1, a second-order rate constant, k(2)(OH-), of 7.4 x 10(3) M-1 s(-1) was determined in the reaction of the Mn-V(O) complex of 1 with hydroxide, whereas its reaction with water occurred much more slowly with a k(2)(H2O) value of 4.4 x 10(-3) M-1 s(-1). This large reactivity difference of Mn-V(O) with hydroxide and water is consistent with different electrocatalytic behaviors of 1 with these two substrates. Significantly, during the electrolysis of 1 with water, a MnIV-peroxo species was identified with various spectroscopic methods, including UV-vis, electron paramagnetic resonance, and infrared spectroscopy. Isotope-labeling experiments confirmed that both O atoms of this peroxo species are derived from water, suggesting the involvement of the WNA mechanism in water oxidation by a Mn complex. Density functional theory calculations suggested that the nucleophilic attack of hydroxide on Mn-V(O) and also WNA to 1e(-)oxidized Mn-V(O) are feasibly involved in the catalytic cycles but that direct WNA to Mn-V(O) is not likely to be the main O-O bond formation pathway in the electrocatalytic water oxidation by 1.									28	2	0	0	0	0	28			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000697286000026	34469154

The rGO@BPQDs could effectively enhance the chemical and structural stability of BPQDs. Zero-dimension rGO@BPQDs were firmly anchored on mesoporous g-C3N4 (CN) via a self-trapping pore confinement effect and pi-pi interactions to form CN/rGO@BPQDs, which remarkably improved the photoelectric properties of CN. The responsive wavelength of CN/rGO@BPQDs could be extended to 800 nm. The kinetic constant of Rhodamine B and tetracycline degradation reached 0.183 and 0.0194 min(-1), respectively. The H2O2 production rate of CN/rGO@BPQDs was 2.6 times that of porous CN. The improved photocatalytic performance and remarkable increase in free radicals are attributed to the formation of n-n type high-low junctions as well as the internal electric field based on different Fermi levels between CN and BPQDs. These collectively promote spatial separation of photogenerated carriers.									200	20	0	0	34	0	205			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000517665200007

Photolysis of mixed chloro-bromo complex 7 with TME yields the bromohydrin (2-bromo-2,3-dimethyl-3-butanol) and 2, consistent with cis-elimination of HOBr. Computational results (TDDFT and DFT) and photochemistry of related complexes suggest a dissociative triplet excited state reaction pathway and that HOCl elimination may occur by an incipient hydroxo radical abstraction of an adjacent halogen atom, but a pathway involving hydroxo radical reaction with solvent or TME to generate a carbon-based radical followed by halogen abstraction from Pt cannot be eliminated.									20	0	0	0	4	0	20			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000330812700022	24484204

The composition and interior cavity of the Co-C/Void/Co9S8 composite could be precisely modulated by controlling the sulfidation reaction. Due to the abundant heterointerfaces, well-controlled cavity, and magnetic-dielectric synergistic effects, the Co-C/Void/Co9S8 exhibited excellent and tunable microwave-absorbing properties. The optimized Co-C/Void/Co9S8, having a loading of 25 wt.% and thickness only 2.2 mm, displayed an ultrabroad absorption bandwidth of 8.2 GHz at high frequencies. Moreover, the composite could achieve an extremely high reflection loss of -54.02 dB at low frequencies by adjusting its loading to 30 wt.%. This study provides a new insight into promising lightweight microwave-absorbing materials with ultrabroad absorption bandwidths and strong low-frequency absorption.									101	6	0	0	7	0	101			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000440733100020

We prepared nanoscale IrO2 anode catalyst, which is mixture of IrO2 nanoparticles (d = 3.7 +/- 1.8 nm) and their agglomerates (d < 200 nm). The linear sweep voltammetry measurement for water oxidation revealed that the nanoscale IrO2 catalyst deposited on a porous carbon paper reduces overpotential for water oxidation by 196 mV from that obtained with an anode composed of commercial microscale IrO2 grans. Furthermore, application of the nanoscale IrO2 catalyst on porous titanium paper not only improved durability but also doubly enhanced water oxidation performance. We examined various PEAEC architectures composed of the nanoscale IrO2 applied Ti anode. Both nanometer- and millimeter-scale approaches realized the best PEAEC performance for GC production, i.e., 59.4% of energy conversion efficiency with 97.1% of Faradaic efficiency for the GC production at 1.8 V and 98.9% of conversion for 3 M OX, which is an almost saturated aqueous solution at operating temperature of the PEAEC (60 degrees C).									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000537667800004

SiC semiconductor is considered as a promising material for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction due to its negative conduction band position. Herein, SiC nanocages is creatively synthesized by simple low temperature molten-salt-mediated magnesiothermic reduction method with using SiO2 as template. The morphology and phase composition of SiC nanocages can be controlled by magnesium dosage and reaction temperature. The 2H and 3C crystal phase in SiC nanocage can form heterophase junctions uniformly to effectively accelerate the photogenerated electron transfer, and plays a key role in improving the photocatalytic activity of 2H/3C-SiC samples. The optimal SiC nanocage sample possesses a CO generation rate of 4.68 lmol g(-1)h(-1) for photocatalytic CO2 reduction, which is 3.25 times higher than that of commercial SiC.

The use of 1 M aqueous sulfuric acid mediates the redox reaction between KRuO4, KMnO4 and Mn2+ to form ternary oxides. At reaction temperature of 100 degrees C the products are mixtures of alpha-MnO2 (hollandite-type) and beta-MnO2 (rutile-type), with some evidence of Ru incorporation in each from their expanded unit cell volumes. At reaction temperature of 200 degrees C solid-solutions beta-Mn1-xRuxO2 are formed and materials with x <= 0.6 have been studied. The amount of Ru included in the oxide is greater than expected from the ratio of metals used in the synthesis, as determined by elemental analysis, implying that some Mn remains unreacted in solution. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows that while the unit cell volume expands in a linear manner, following Vegard's law, the tetragonal lattice parameters, and the a/c ratio, do not follow the extrapolated trends: this anisotropic behaviour is consistent with the different local coordination of the metals in the end members. Powder XRD patterns show increased peak broadening with increasing ruthenium content, which is corroborated by electron microscopy that shows nanocrystalline material. X-ray absorption near-edge spectra show that the average oxidation state of Mn in the solid solutions is reduced below +4 while that of Ru is increased above +4, suggesting some redistribution of charge. Analysis of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure provides complementary local structural information, confirming the formation of a solid solution, while X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows that the surface oxidation states of both Ru and Mn are on average lower than +4, suggesting a disordered surface layer may be present in the materials.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000517990300030	32048696

The three-dimensional structures of the enzyme from Thermus thermophilus HB8 in its unliganded form and complexed with the substrate analogue 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid have been determined at 2.15 and 2.0 Angstrom resolution, respectively. The complexed form, assigned as an enamine, uncovered the interactions of the cofactor-analogue conjugate with the active site residues. The binding of the substrate analogue induces a large conformational change at the domain level. The small domain rotates by about 25degrees and approaches the large domain to close the active site. The complicated catalytic process of the enzyme has been elucidated based on the complex structure to reveal the stereochemistry of the reaction and to present the released inorganic phosphate as a possible catalyst to carry a proton to the Cgamma atom of the substrate.									29	1	0	0	24	0	31			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000186452300120	12952961	
J	Xiong, J; Subramaniam, S; Govindjee				Govindjee, Govindjee/ABF-3362-2021				A knowledge-based three dimensional model of the Photosystem II reaction center of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				56	3			229	254						JUN 1998	1998	In this Minireview, a comparison of the binding niches of the PS II cofactors from several existing models of the PS II reaction center is provided. In particular, it discusses a three dimensional model of the Photosystem II (PS II) reaction center including D1, D2 and cytochrome b559 proteins from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that was specifically generated for this Minireview. This model is the most complete to date and includes accessory chlorophyll(z)s, a manganese cluster, two molecules of beta-carotene and cytochrome b559, all of which are essential components of the PS II reaction center. The modeling of the D1 and D2 proteins was primarily based on homology with the L and M subunits of the anoxygenic purple bacterial photosynthetic reaction centers. The non-homologous loop regions were built using a sequence specific approach by searching for the best-matched protein segments in the Protein Data Bank, and by imposing the matching conformations on the corresponding D1 and D2 regions. Cytochrome b559 which is in close proximity to D1 and D2 was tentatively modeled in alpha/beta conformation and docked on the Q(B) side of the PS II reaction center according to experimental suggestions. An alternate docking on the Q(A) side is also shown for comparison. The cofactors in the PS II reaction center were modeled either by adopting the structures from the bacterial counterparts, when available, with modifications based on existing experimental data or by de novo modeling and docking in the most probable positions in the reaction center complex. The specific features of this model are the inclusion of the tetramanganese cluster (with calcium and chloride ions) in a open, C-shaped structure modeled within the D1/D2/cytochrome b559 complex with D1-D170, D1-E189, D1-D342 and D1-A344 as putative ligands; and the modeling of two cis beta-carotenes and two accessory chlorophyll(z)s liganded by D1-H118 and D2-H117. We also analyzed residues in the model which may be involved in the D1 and D2 inter-protein interactions, as well as residues which may be involved in putative bicarbonate and water binding and transport.									82	3	0	0	61	0	85			0166-8595			WOS:000075545400001

Herein, we report a facile and large scale strategy exploiting a porous non-precious bimetallic oxide of NiWO4 for the NRR under ambient conditions. Benefiting from the above-mentioned merits, the designed electrocatalyst achieved outstanding catalytic activities in both 0.1 M HCl (NH3 yield: (40.05 +/- 1.45) mu g h(-1) mg(cat)(-1)., Faraday efficiency (FE): (19.32 +/- 0.68)% at -0.3 V) and 0.1 Na2SO4 (NH3 yield: (23.14 +/- 1.75) mu g h(-1) mg(cat)(-1)., Farady efficiency: (10.18 +/- 0.62)% at -0.3 V), and these efficiencies are superior to most of the reported non-precious metals for the NRR. Furthermore, the prepared catalyst presented excellent stability in both acidic and neutral media for up to 20 h. This work opens a constructive avenue for optimizing the catalytic performance of metal oxides and other transition metal-based catalysts for NRRs.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000509545700021	31859336

The scanning electron microscope results show that the metallopolymer at the glassy carbon surface has a nanoflake-like lamellar structure, and there is no molecular structural change after treatment with NaOH. Voltammetry measurements indicate that the metallopolymer acts as efficient material for the electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol, where a high-valent nickel(IV) was revealed as the reactive intermediate during the anodic scan. An isopotential point can be observed in rotating disk electrode voltammetry for ethanol oxidation. The electrode surface may be considered to consist of two independent electrochemical regions, one corresponding to the ethanol electro-oxidation by nickel(IV) and the second corresponding to water oxidation. The Tafel slopes were found to be 246 mV dec(-1) at low overpotentials and 44 mV dec(-1) at high overpotentials, which suggest that the first electron transfer step is the rate controlling step. The specific activity of the metallopolymer-modified electrode for the ethanol electro-oxidation reaction was 6.66 mA cm(-2) for 0.130 mu mol cm(-2) of electroactive species of metallopolymer at 0.6 V vs. SCE.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2196-0216			WOS:000450042200028

Blocking LBP and CD14 binding might prevent LPS-induced inflammation. In previous studies, we obtained a peptide analog (MP12) for the LBP/ CD14 binding site and showed that this peptide analog had anti-endotoxin activity. In this study, we used in vitro directed evolution for this peptide analog to improve its in vivo and in vitro anti-endotoxin activity.Methods: We used error-prone PCR (ep-PCR) and induced mutations in the C-terminus of LBP and attached the PCR products to T7 phages to establish a mutant phage display library. The positive clones that competed with LBP for CD14 binding was obtained by screening. We used both in vivo and in vitro experiments to compare the anti-endotoxin activities of a polypeptide designated P1 contained in a positive clone and MP12.Results: 11 positive clones were obtained from among target phages. Sequencing showed that 9 positive clones had a threonine (T) to methionine (M) mutation in amino acid 287 of LBP. Compared to polypeptide MP12, polypeptide P1 significantly inhibited LPS-induced TNF-alpha expression and NF-kappa B activity in U937 cells (P < 0.05). Compared to MP12, P1 significantly improved arterial oxygen pressure, an oxygenation index, and lung pathology scores in LPS-induced ARDS rats (P < 0.05).Conclusion: By in vitro directed evolution of peptide analogs for the LBP/ CD14 binding site, we established a new polypeptide (P1) with a threonine (T)-to-methionine (M) mutation in amino acid 287 of LBP. This polypeptide had high anti-endotoxin activity in vitro and in vivo, which suggested that amino acid 287 in the C-terminus of LBP may play an important role in LBP binding with CD14.									13	6	0	0	9	0	19			1932-6203			WOS:000339992400015	25025695

STEM-EELS Analysis of High Entropy Oxide Nanoparticles								Microscopy and Microanalysis				27	suppl.1			884	6		10.1017/S1431927621003421				2021	2021	Summary form only given. High entropy oxide (HEO) nanomaterials are new category of ceramic nanomaterials that have promising applications in the field of energy storage, catalysis and biomedical fields attributing to their unique physicochemical properties.Five or more immiscible elements can be integrated within a single nanoparticle with high entropy configuration by utilizing synthesis processes with rapid heating and cooling rates.Studies show that the thermodynamic properties, mainly enthalpy and free energy, influence the chemical oxidation states and phase stability of the individual elemental oxide comprised within a HEO configuration.Although substrate dependent or aerosol synthesis methods are utilized for the successful synthesis of near equimolar high entropy oxide nanomaterials, there exists a knowledge gap in the fundamental understanding of transition of oxidation states from unary metal oxides to binary, ternary, quaternary and quinary HEOs. The investigation of oxidation states and chemical shifts of individual elements during their alloying composition evolution can reveal novel atomistic attributes of elemental affinities towards each other and of their corresponding crystal phase evolution to achieve the final stable structure within an entropy configuration. In the present work, the HEO nanoparticles composed of Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn elements are synthesized by flame spray pyrolysis method. The atomic resolution spinel crystal structure of high angle annular dark field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image of synthesized HEO nanoparticle. The electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) elemental mapping and high energy loss spectrum acquired from a single quinary HEO nanoparticle. To investigate the crystalphase and oxidation state evolution unary -Fe oxide and Mn oxide, binary -Mn/Fe oxide, ternary -Mn/Fe/Ni oxide, quaternary -Mn/Fe/Ni/Cu oxide and quinary -Mn/Fe/Ni/Cu/Zn oxide nanoparticles are produced under the same synthesis conditions. Results indicate that the high-resolution EELS analysis of L3,2edges of individual elements in the high loss and M-edges in the low-loss regions, and corresponding energy loss near edge spectroscopy (ELNES) features enable the identification of oxidation states and chemical shifts for each element within a quinary HEO configuration, which also can predict tetragonal and octagonal occupancy of selective cations in the complex spinel crystal structure. The EELS results also show that the oxidation states for the each of five elements varies considering their respective coordination with oxygen element and possibly with the neighboring metal cations. To investigate the chemical affinity towards each other and the role of each metal cations as an electron-acceptor and electron-doner within a HEO configuration, additionally the systematic EELS analysis of unary, binary, ternary and quaternary entropy oxide nanoparticles is performed. Conclusively, fundamental oxidation state evolution for Fe and Mn elements from unary to quinary high entropy oxide configurations helps in understanding the chemical affinity and coordination among metal cations to achieve the final high entropy stable crystal structure. These results will provide the key insights for tailoring the properties of complex HEO nanomaterials according to the specific industrial applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1431-9276			INSPEC:20807345

For this study, a broad-spectrum carbon and oxygen doped, porous g-C3N4 (COCN) was synthesized via a simple copyrolysis of dicyandiamide and methylamine hydroiodide (CH5N center dot HI). The 0.3COCN demonstrated an excellent photocatalytic degradation of indometacin (IDM), which was 5.9 times higher than bulk g-C3N4. The enhanced photocatalytic activity could be ascribed to the broad-spectrum utilization of solar light and improved charge separation efficiency. Reactive species (RSs) scavenging experiments have shown that O-2(center dot-) and O-1(2) were the dominant active species. Further, the 0.3COCN exhibits excellent yield of hydroxyl radicals which was confirmed by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra. Meanwhile, the degradation pathways of IDM were proposed according the HRAM LC-MS/MS and total organic carbon (TOC). This research provided a new strategy for a broad-spectrum photocatalyst, and a promising strategy for environmental remediation.									42	0	0	0	18	0	42			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000514748600035	31901544

The BiVO4 nanostructures were derived from bismuth nitrate and ammonia metavanadate as starting precursors and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were used as stabilizers for tuning the morphology (nanorod, nanospheriod and nanoparticulate). The influence of post-calcination treatment (450, 550 and 650 degrees C) on structural, optical and photocatalytic properties of BiVO4 was studied. The post-calcination treatment strongly induces the crystallization process and produce monoclinic BiVO4 structure with predominant (112) crystallite phases. The absorbance of BiVO4 shows broad coverage of visible light wavelength region up to 550 nm, which is appreciable for solar light driven photocatalysis. Among the different calcinated samples, anisotropy rod-shape BiVO4 (calcinated at 450 degrees C) shows high optical absorbance than other treated (550 and 650 degrees C) samples. The monotonic shift in characteristic Raman vibration mode at 824 cm(-1) with increasing calcination temperature indicates that the V-O bond length is affected by Bi3+ diffusivity. The PL spectra of these samples explore the intrinsic defects present in BlVO4, and found to be high in high temperature calcinated samples. The photocatalytic property of resultant BiVO4 samples was evaluated in oxygen generation with Ag+ donors. As a result of reduced defects and high optical absorbance, the BiVO4 calcinated at 450 degrees C showed high photocatalytic oxygen yield (1.02 mmol) compared with high temperature calcinated samples (0.48 mmol). The appreciable quantity of solar fuel O-2 generation from the low-cost co-precipitation method can be widely implemented in other visible light metal oxide nanostructures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Currently, two theories for their formation have been presented. These are the final flash scenario, in which a dying asymptotic giant branch star throws off its atmosphere to reveal the hydrogen poor, heavily processed material underneath, and the double degenerate scenario, in which two white dwarfs merge to produce a new star with renewed vigour. Some theories predict that the temperatures reached during the latter scenario would destroy any lithium originally present in the white dwarfs. The observed lithium content of some R Coronae Borealis stars, therefore, is often interpreted as an indication that the final flash scenario best describes their formation. In this paper, we show that lithium production can, indeed, occur in the merging of a helium white dwarf with a carbon-oxygen white dwarf if their chemical composition, particularly that of He-3, is fully considered. The production mechanism is described in detail, and the sensitivity of lithium production to the merger environment is investigated. Nucleosynthesis post-processing calculations of smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) tracer particles are performed to show that any lithium produced in these environments will be concentrated towards the cloud of material surrounding the R CrB star. Measurements of the lithium content of these clouds would, therefore, provide a valuable insight into the formation mechanism of R CrB stars.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0004-6361			WOS:000305803300154

Two nominal values of the fuel pellet oxygen-to-metal ratio (O/M), 1.95 and 1.98, were used as a test parameter. Emphasis was placed on the behavior of restructuring and redistribution of actinides which directly affect the fuel performance and the fuel design for fast reactors. Microstructural evolutions in the fuels were observed by optical microscopy and the redistribution of constituent elements was determined by EPMA using false color X-ray mapping and quantitative point analyses. The ceramography results showed that structural changes occurred quickly in the initial stage of irradiation. Restructuring of the fuel from middle to upper axial positions developed and was almost completed after the 24-h irradiation. No sign of fuel melting was found in any of the specimens. The EPMA results revealed that Am as well as Pu migrated radially up the temperature gradient to the center of the fuel pellet. The increase in Am concentration on approaching the edge of the central void and its maximum value were higher than those of Pu after the 10-min irradiation and the difference was more pronounced after the 24-h irradiation. The increment of the Am and Pu concentrations due to redistribution increased with increasing central void size. In all of the specimens examined, the extent of redistribution of Am and Pu was higher in the fuel of O/M ratio of 1.98 than in that of 1.95. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	ErmakovaGerdes, S; Shestakov, S; Vermaas, W								Random chemical mutagenesis of a specific psbDI region coding for a lumenal loop of the D2 protein of photosystem II in Synechocystis sp PCC 6803								PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY				30	2			243	254		10.1007/BF00020111				JAN 1996	1996	To identify amino acid residues of the D2 protein that are critical for functional photosystem II (PS II), sodium bisulfite was utilized for in vitro random mutagenesis of the psbDI gene from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Sodium bisulfite reacts specifically with cytosine in single-stranded regions of DNA and does not attack double-stranded DNA. Using a hybrid plasmid that was single-stranded in the region to be mutagenized and that was double-stranded elsewhere, mutations were targeted to a specific psbDI region coding for the lumenal A-B loop of the D2 protein. Several mutants were isolated with a total of 15 different amino acid changes in the loop. The majority of these mutations did not result in a loss of photoautotrophic growth or in significantly altered PS II function. However, mutation of Glu-69 to Lys, Ser-79 to Phe, and Ser-88 to Phe were found to influence photosystem II activity; the importance of the latter two residues for proper PS II function was unexpected. Cells carrying the double mutation S79F/S88F in D2 did not grow photoautotrophically and had no functionally active PS II centers. The single mutant S79F was also incapable of photoautotrophic growth, but displayed reasonably stable oxygen evolution, while PS II function in the single mutant S88F appeared to be close to normal. Because of the more pronounced phenotype of the S79F/S88F strain as compared to the single mutants, both Ser residues appear to affect stable assembly and function of the PS II complex. The mechanism by which the S79F mutant loses photoautotrophic growth remains to be established. However, these results show the potential of targeted random mutagenesis to identify functionally important residues in selected regions of proteins.									19	0	0	0	14	0	19			0167-4412			WOS:A1996UB68800003	8616249

The sequential injection of DEZn and O-2 plasma was employed for the plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition of ZnO thin film. As the growth temperature of ZnO film was increased from 100 degrees C to 300 degrees C, the crystallinity of ZnO film was improved from amorphous to highly ordered (002) direction ploy-crystal due to self crystallization. Increasing oxygen plasma time in PEALD process also introduces growing of hexagonal wurtzite phase of ZnO nanocrystal. Excess of oxygen plasma time induces enhanced deep level emission band (500 similar to 700 nm) in photoluminescence due to Zn vacancies and other defects. The evolution of structural and optical properties of PEALD ZnO films also involves in change of electrical conductivity by 3 orders of magnitude. The highly tunable PEALD ZnO thin films were employed as the electron conductive layers in inverted polymer solar cells. Our study indicates that both structural and optical properties rather than electrical conductivities of ZnO films play more important role for the effective charge collection in photovoltaic device operation. The ability to tune the materials properties of undoped ZnO films via PEALD should extend their functionality over the wide range of advanced electronic applications. (C) 2013 Author(s).

These reactions can affect flow pathways within fractured shale and produced water chemistry. Knowledge of these chemical reactions also provides valuable information for planning wastewater treatment strategies. This study focused on characterizing reservoir reactions through analysis of produced water chemistry from the Marcellus Shale Energy and Environmental Laboratory field site in Morgantown, WV, USA. Analysis of fracturing fluids, time-series produced waters (PW) over 16 months of operation of two hydraulically fractured gas wells, and shale rocks from the same well for metal concentrations and multiple isotope signatures (delta H-2 and delta O-18 of water, delta Li-7, delta B-11, Sr-87/Sr-86) showed that the chemical and isotopic composition of early (<10 days) PW samples record water-rock interactions during the fracturing period. Acidic dissolution of carbonate minerals was evidenced by the increase in TOC, B/Na, Sr/Na, Ca/Na, and the decrease in Sr-87/Sr-86 in PW returning in the first few days toward the Sr-87/Sr-86 signature of carbonate cement. The enrichment of Li-6 in these early (e.g., day 1) PW samples is most likely a result of desorption of Li from clays and organic matter due to the injection of fracturing fluid. Redox-active trace elements appear to be controlled by oxidation-reduction reactions and potentially reactions involving wellbore steel. Overall, PW chemistry is primarily controlled by mixing between early PW with local in-situ formation water however certain geochemical reactions (e.g., carbonate cement dissolution and desorption of Li-6 from clays and organic matter) can be inferred from PW composition monitored immediately over the first ten days of water return.

J	Yang, Jia; Wu, Ye; Li, Lu; Li, Chenghao				YANG, JIA/GXH-8334-2022				Comprehensive analysis of the BES1 gene family and its expression under abiotic stress and hormone treatment in Populus trichocarpa								PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY				173				1	13		10.1016/j.plaphy.2022.01.019				JAN 15 2022	2022	The BRI1 EMS SUPPRESSOR 1/BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1 (BES1/BZR1) plays a vital role in plant growth and development and stress responses, but there are few studies on poplar BES1 genes. In this study, we identified 14 BES1 genes in the Populus trichocarpa genome and analyzed the expression under hormone treatment and abiotic stress. The PtrBES1 genes were classified into seven subgroups (I-VII) through phylogenetic analysis. All the paralogous gene pairs were shown to be subjected to expansion by segment duplication and purification selection during the PtrBES1 family evolution. Promoter cis-element analysis showed that the PtrBES1 promoter contains stress related cis-elements including ABRE-motif, MBS and TC-rich elements. Quantitative real time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis showed that the PtrBES1 genes were upregulated upon NaCl, Polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG6000) stress as well as the major stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. Under the three treatments, PtrBES1-7 showed high expression levels in leaves and roots. Physiological experiments showed that the overexpression PtrBES1-7 line could enhance tolerance to drought stress in P. trichocarpa by improving the ability to scavenge ROS (reactive oxygen species). This is specifically reflected in the fact that the overexpression line contains less ROS (O-2(-) and H2O2) and more antioxidant enzymes (1.42 times SOD and 1.5 times POD) than the control line. The preliminary results of this study provided a solid basis for the future functional studies of the BES1 gene family in P. trichocarpa.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0981-9428	1873-2690		WOS:000783627000001	35085861

Thermal decomposition and phase evolution processes of gel precursors as well as crystal structure, micromorphology and electrical properties of sintered samples were investigated by thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and direct current four-wire technique. Results reveal that well-crystallized Sm0.9Sr0.1Al1-xCrxO3-delta nanopowders with an orthorhombic perovskite structure can be obtained by calcining the gel precursors at 900 degC for 5 h. Conductivities of SSAC ceramics are dominated by p-type conduction and conduction behavior conforms to the adiabatic small polaron hopping transport mechanism. Both electrical conductivity and relative density of Sm0.9Sr0.1Al1-xCrxO3-delta ceramics increase initially and then decrease with increasing sintering temperature, and the sample sintered at 1 550 degC for 10 h has the highest electrical conductivity and relative density among all the samples. The conductivities and lattice constants of the SSAC ceramics with different compositions exhibit the same dependence on Cr dosage and their values first increase and then decrease with increasing Cr dosage, and finally begin to increase again as x is more than 0.2, while the dependence of corresponding apparent activation energies on Cr dosage is just the opposite.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0454-5648			INSPEC:13122520

Khare, Rohit/AAO-1100-2020				Interactions of chlorine plasmas with silicon chloride-coated reactor walls during and after silicon etching								JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY A				30	5					051306	10.1116/1.4742319				SEP 2012	2012	The interplay between chlorine inductively coupled plasmas (ICP) and reactor walls coated with silicon etching products has been studied in situ by Auger electron spectroscopy and line-of-sight mass spectrometry using the spinning wall method. A bare silicon wafer mounted on a radio frequency powered electrode (-108 V dc self-bias) was etched in a 13.56 MHz, 400 W ICP. Etching products, along with some oxygen due to erosion of the discharge tube, deposit a Si-oxychloride layer on the plasma reactor walls, including the rotating substrate surface. Without Si-substrate bias, the layer that was previously deposited on the walls with Si-substrate bias reacts with Cl-atoms in the chlorine plasma, forming products that desorb, fragment in the plasma, stick on the spinning wall and sometimes react, and then desorb and are detected by the mass spectrometer. In addition to mass-to-charge (m/e) signals at 63, 98, 133, and 168, corresponding to SiClx (x = 1 - 4), many Si-oxychloride fragments with m/e = 107, 177, 196, 212, 231, 247, 275, 291, 294, 307, 329, 345, 361, and 392 were also observed from what appear to be major products desorbing from the spinning wall. It is shown that the evolution of etching products is a complex "recycling" process in which these species deposit and desorb from the walls many times, and repeatedly fragment in the plasma before being detected by the mass spectrometer. SiCl3 sticks on the walls and appears to desorb for at least milliseconds after exposure to the chlorine plasma. Notably absent are signals at m/e = 70 and 72, indicating little or no Langmuir-Hinshelwood recombination of Cl on this surface, in contrast to previous studies done in the absence of Si etching.

Mediated Fuel Cells: Soluble Redox Mediators and Their Applications to Electrochemical Reduction of O-2 and Oxidation of H-2, Alcohols, Biomass, and Complex Fuels								CHEMICAL REVIEWS				120	8			3749	3786		10.1021/acs.chemrev.9b00717				APR 22 2020	2020	Mediated fuel cells are electrochemical devices that produce power in a manner similar to that of conventional proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). They differ from PEMFCs in their use of redox mediators dissolved in liquid electrolyte to conduct oxidation of the fuel or reduction of the oxidant, typically O-2, in bulk solution. The mediators transport electrons (and often protons) between the electrode and the catalysts or chemical reagents in solution. This strategy can help overcome many of the challenges associated with conventional fuel cells, including managing complex multiphase reactions (as in O-2 reduction) or the use of challenging or heterogeneous fuels, such as hydrocarbons, polyols, and biomass. Mediators are also commonly used in enzymatic fuel cells, where direct electron transfer from the electrode to the enzymatic active site can be slow. This review provides a comprehensive survey of historical and recent mediated fuel cell efforts, including applications using chemical and enzymatic catalysts.									53	3	0	0	4	0	53			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000529143300005	32216295

The results showed that, with the itiCrease of basicity, the viscosity of mold flux was attenuated dramatically, and then kept constant or slight increased in the low temperature region. The reason could be explained as the degree of polymerization (DOP) of the network structure was first reduced significantly with the addition of basicity, and then the further depolytherization is less pronounced with the further increase of basicity. Beside the formation of high melting point substance leads to the slight increase of viscosity. Moreover, it suggested that the viscosity of mold flux is decreased with the addition of B2O3 content, due to the fact that B2O3 is a low melting point oxide which could substantially lower the break temperature of mold flux. The result of FTIR indicated B2O3 acts as network former, and tends to form B2O3-trihedral and [Bad-tetrahedral structural units, which would connect with each bther to form some simple network structure such as diborate or pentaborate. With the addition of B2O3, the free oxygen ions (O-2(-)) would depolymerize the diborate structural unit, and the depolymerized diborate would link again with free [BO3]-trihedral to form complex pentaborate groups. Moreover, the effect of above addition on the apparent activation energy for viscous flow and break temperature of mold flux also were discussed. The results obtained in this paper provide the detailed study of the structure evolution of Fluorine-free mold flux when B203 is added. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Here we unify computational and experimental approaches to use the Zn3V3O8 (001) surface supporting noble metal Ru as a bifunctional catalyst for the OER and HER in alkaline media. In particular, different reaction sites have been studied at four surface terminations along the [001] orientation: the A-layer with V atoms at octahedral sites, the C-layer with V and Zn atoms at octahedral sites, and with additional Zn atoms at tetrahedral sites (B-layer and D-layer, respectively). The first-principles density functional theory (DFT) results indicate that the B-layer termination with V and tetrahedrally coordinated Zn on the top showed the best OER catalytic effect, while the HER favored the D-layer termination with extra Zn atoms at the octahedral sites on the top layer. Our DFT results also suggest that Ru doping by substituting V and Zn atoms at the octahedral site could dramatically enhance the catalytic activities for the OER and HER, respectively. In particular, compared to undoped Zn3V3O8, Ru doping could reduce the calculated OER overpotential from 0.58 V to 0.30 V, which has been confirmed by our experimental results that the OER overpotential decreased from 480 mV to 260 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-o). Moreover, the experimental results show that Ru doping could reduce the HER overpotential from 152 mV to 70 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-r). The new insights into the underlying catalytic mechanisms may be further extended to many similar electrocatalytic processes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000707163500001	34647934	
J	Reyes, SC; Sinfelt, JH; Feeley, JS								Evolution of processes for synthesis gas production: Recent developments in an old technology								INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH				42	8			1588	1597		10.1021/ie0206913				APR 16 2003	2003	The manufacture of gas mixtures of carbon monoxide and hydrogen has been a vitally important part of chemical technology for about a century. Originally, such mixtures were obtained by the reaction of steam with incandescent coke and were known as "water gas". Used first as a fuel, water gas soon attracted attention as a source of hydrogen and carbon monoxide for the production of chemicals, at which time it gradually became known as synthesis gas. Eventually, steam reforming processes, in which steam is reacted with natural gas (methane) or a petroleum naphtha over a nickel catalyst, found wide application for the production of synthesis gas. A modified version of steam reforming known as autothermal reforming, which is a combination of partial oxidation near the reactor inlet with conventional steam reforming further along the reactor, improves the overall reactor efficiency and increases the flexibility of the process. Noncatalytic partial oxidation processes using oxygen instead of steam also found wide application for synthesis gas manufacture, with the special feature that they could utilize low value feedstocks such as heavy petroleum residua. In recent years, catalytic partial oxidation employing very short reaction times (milliseconds) at high temperatures (850-1000 degreesC) is providing still another approach to synthesis gas manufacture, as Professor Lanny Schmidt and his students have shown in their pioneering exploratory research in this area. (See, for example, Hickman and Schmidt Science 1993, 259, 343.) Here, we consider some crucial issues in catalytic partial oxidation and report some new data with a bearing on these issues. Nearly complete conversion of methane, with close to 100% selectivity to H-2 and CO2 can be obtained with a Rh monolith under well-controlled conditions. Experiments on the catalytic partial oxidation of n-hexane conducted with added steam give much higher yields of H-2 than can be obtained in experiments without steam, a result of much interest in obtaining hydrogen-rich streams for fuel cell applications.									51	3	0	0	1	0	54			0888-5885			WOS:000182226500009

Most of these value-added elements which are primarily employed in electronic goods are disposed of by incineration and land-filling. This is a serious issue besides just environmental pollution, as IUPAC recognized that such ignorance of or poor attention to e-waste recycling has put several elements in the periodic table to the list of endangered elements. Recycling these wastes utilized for electrocatalytic water splitting to produce H2. These recovered e-wastes materials are used as electrocatalysts for the water-splitting, additives to enhance reaction kinetics, and substrate electrodes as well. Recycling and recovery of value-added materials in the view of applying them to electrocatalytic water splitting with endangered elements' perspective have not been covered by any recent review so far. Hence, this review is dedicated to discussing the opportunities available with recycling e-wastes, types of value-added materials that can be recovered for water splitting, strategies exploited, and prospects are discussed in details.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000696900700002	34332482

Here we demonstrate proton releases, dioxygen formation, and substrate water incorporation in response to Mn4CaO5 oxidation in the protein environment, using a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical approach and molecular dynamics simulations. In S-2, H2O at the W1 site forms a low-barrier H-bond with D1-Asp61. In the S-2-to-S-3 transition, oxidation of OW1H- to O-W1(center dot-), concerted proton transfer from OW1H- to D1-Asp61, and binding of a water molecule Wn-W1 at O-W1(center dot-) are observed. In S-4, Wn-W1 facilitates oxo-oxyl radical coupling between O-W1(center dot-) and corner mu-oxo O4. Deprotonation via D1-Asp61 leads to formation of O-W1=O4. As O-W1=O4 moves away from Mn, H2O at W539 is incorporated into the vacant O4 site of the O-2-evolved Mn4CaO4 cluster, forming a mu-oxo bridge (Mn3-O-W539-Mn4) in an exergonic process.

The D1 subunit of this complex contains most of the ligating amino acid residues for the Mn4CaO5 core of the water-oxidizing complex (WOC). Most cyanobacteria have 3-5 copies of the psbA gene coding for at least two isoforms of D1, whereas algae and plants have only one isoform. Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 contains two D1 isoforms; D1:1 is expressed under low light conditions, and D1:2 is up-regulated in high light or stress conditions. Using a heterologous psbA expression system in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we have measured growth rate, WOC cycle efficiency, and O-2 yield as a function of D1:1, D1:2, or the native algal D1 isoform. D1:1-PSII cells outcompete D1:2-PSII cells and accumulate more biomass in light-limiting conditions. However, D1:2-PSII cells easily outcompete D1:1-PSII cells at high light intensities. The native C. reinhardtii-PSII WOC cycles less efficiently at all light intensities and produces less O-2 than either cyanobacterial D1 isoform. D1:2-PSII makes more O-2 per saturating flash than D1:1-PSII, but it exhibits lower WOC cycling efficiency at low light intensities due to a 40% faster charge recombination rate in the S-3 state. These functional advantages of D1:1-PSII and D1:2-PSII at low and high light regimes, respectively, can be explained by differences in predicted redox potentials of PSII electron acceptors that control kinetic performance.									27	0	0	0	26	0	28			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000315342500020	23271739

Complex 3 was prepared by the reaction of [Y(NO3)(3)center dot 6H(2)O] (1) with 3 equiv of Hdbm (2) in presence of NaOH. The molecular structure of 3 in the solid-state was determined by single X-ray crystal diffraction. Both C-1 symmetric crystallographically independent species of 3 possess a YO7 coordination setup with minor deviation from an ideal capped octahedron coordination geometry (Lambda enantiomer). Complex 3 forms a ID chain, due to intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the coordinated H2O molecule and the O atom of the dbm ligand, respectively. The thermal decomposition behavior of 3 was investigated by thermogravimetric studies in the temperature range of 40-800 degrees C and 40-1300 degrees C under an oxygen and argon atmosphere, respectively. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements of the residues confirmed the formation of Y2O3. Complex 3 was applied as a spin-coating precursor for yttrium oxide film formation on either Si wafers with a continuous 100 nm thick SrO2 film, or with a native oxide layer. The as-deposited Y2O3 layers are smooth, conformal, dense and transparent and are of a thickness of 27 and 30 nm, respectively.

The proposed genesis of one such radionuclide, Be-10, by spallation reactions of carbon and oxygen(2-5) led to the hypothesis of enhanced irradiation in the early Solar System(6-8). An alternative scenario of production of Be-10 (half-life t(1/2) = 1.386 +/- 0.016 million years(9)) by a neutrino process in a supernova arising from the core collapse of a low-mass star (11.8 solar masses, M-circle dot) has recently been suggested(10) and can explain the observed abundance of Be-10 in the early Solar System. Here, we report well-resolved excesses in Li-7/Li-6 of up to similar to 21.5% in a calcium-and aluminium-rich inclusion (CAI) from the Efremovka meteorite that correlate with Be-9/Li-6, suggestive of in situ decay of Be-7. The in situ decay of Be-7 to Li-7, with a characteristic half-life of 53.12 +/- 0.07 days(11), entails multiple episodes of enhanced irradiation in the early Solar System, which have been observed recently in other Sun-like stars(12,13). The short half-life of Be-7 limits its production by interaction of solar energetic particles (SEPs) with the nebular gas and solids, and provides constraints on the genealogy and chronology of CAIs. Irradiation of the solid and gaseous precursors of CAIs of solar composition by a superflare (X-ray luminosity approximately 10(32) erg s(-1)) during the terminal phase of class I or II of the pre-main-sequence stages of the Sun explains the isotopic properties, distinctive petrographic features and diffusivity constraints in the CAI.									12	1	0	0	0	0	13			2397-3366			WOS:000470757700014

Previous studies have well-demonstrated that electrochemical reduction (ER) pretreatment of bare and Ti-doped alpha-Fe2O3 electrodes enhances water photooxidation efficiencies, however, the mechanism underlying this improvement remains poorly understood. In this study, this was quantitatively investigated by multiple photoelectrochemical techniques and transient absorption spectroscopy, using the doped electrodes as examples. The results reveal that the kinetics of photoholes after moving to the electrode surface can be well described by a model of surface-state mediated charge transfer and recombination. The reason for the photocurrent enhancement is attributed to a significantly increased charge transfer rate constant (k(ct)) and a decreased surface recombination rate constant (k(sr)) by ER. The reason for the accelerated k(ct) is that a new type of surface state, with a favorable energy position for water oxidation, is produced. The decreased k(sr) is due to the reduced electron density at the surface of the semiconductor, resulted predominately from the negatively shifted flat band potential. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of water photooxidation and enlighten a simple way to develop more efficient electrodes.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000529178800014	32227037

Despite their importance, these mechanisms remain ill-defined in most animal groups. This study focuses on the acute inflammatory response of chickens, important both as an avian model with a unique position in evolution as well as an increasingly notable target of infectious zoonotic diseases. We took advantage of an in vivo self-resolving intra-abdominal challenge model to provide an integrative view of leukocyte responses during the induction and resolution phases of acute inflammation. Our results showed rapid leukocyte infiltration into the abdominal cavity post zymosan challenge (significant increase as early as 4 h), which was dominated by heterophils. Peak leukocyte infiltration and ROS production reached maximum levels at 12 h post challenge, which was significantly earlier than comparative studies in teleost fish and mice. Both heterophils and monocyte/macrophages contributed to ROS production. Local leukocyte infiltration was preceded by an increase in peripheral leukocytes and a drop in the number of bone marrow leukocytes. The proportion of apoptotic leukocytes increased following peak of acute inflammation, rising to significant levels within the abdominal cavity by 48 h, consistent with other indicators for the resolution of inflammation. Importantly, comparison of chicken phagocytic responses with those previously shown in agnathan, teleost and murine models suggested a progressive evolutionary shift towards an increased sensitivity to pro-inflammatory pathogen-derived particles and decreased sensitivity towards homeostatic stimuli. Thus, while significant conservation can be noted across the immune systems of endotherms, this study highlights additional unique features that govern the induction and resolution of acute inflammation in the avian system, which may be relevant to disease susceptibility and performance.

The surface morphology, microstructure and composition of the coatings were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The contribution of the graphene compounds into the anode composition to improve the corrosion and electrocatalytic features was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), polarization measurements, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and an accelerated stability test (AST). The most efficient anode passed the maximum electrical charge at about 145.2 mC cm(-2), which was 4.5 times higher than the RuO2-TiO2 (RT) coating, in 0.5 M NaCl + 1 M H2SO4 solution and it was found that the specific current density per unit of the actual surface area (i(s)) ratio of chlorine and oxygen evolution for the optimized electrode was about 3 times higher than the RT electrode which indicates the considerable selectivity behavior of this electrode. The charge transfer resistance of the novel DSA reduced to 2.39 k Omega, while the stability and coating lifetime was improved to 7530 h at j = 1.2 A cm(-2) which illustrates that graphene oxide can be used to improve the electrocatalytic performance of DSA anodes.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000448406300010

Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce mutations into a segment of the psbB gene encoding the large extrinsic loop region of CPa-1 in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Altered psbB genes were introduced into a mutant recipient strain (DEL-1) of Synechocystis in which the genomic psbB gene had been partially deleted. Initial target sites for mutagenesis were absolutely conserved basic residue pairs occurring within the large extrinsic loop. One mutation, RR384385GG, produced a strain with impaired photosystem II activity. This strain exhibited growth characteristics comparable to controls. However, at saturating light intensities this mutant strain evolved oxygen at only 50% of the rate of the control strains. Quantum yield measurements at low light intensities indicated that the mutant had 30% fewer fully functional photosystem II centers than do control strains of Synechocystis. Immunological analysis of a number of photosystem II protein components indicated that the mutant accumulates normal quantities of photosystem II proteins and that the ratio of photosystem II to photosystem I proteins is comparable to that found in control strains. Upon exposure to high light intensities the mutant cells exhibited a markedly increased susceptibility to photoinactivation. However, Tris-treated thylakoid membranes from both the mutant and wild-type exhibited comparable rates of photoinactivation. Thylakoid membranes isolated from RR384385GG exhibited only 15% of the H2O to 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol electron transport rate observed in wild-type strains. The 1,5-diphenylcarbazide to 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol electron transport rates of Tris-treated thylakoids from the mutant, however, were comparable to control rates. These results suggest that alteration of this basic residue pair leads to a defect associated with the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II.									44	1	0	0	40	0	45			0006-2960			WOS:A1992JZ52300029	1445882

Al2O3 inclusions could be transformed into CaO-Al2O3-MgO-CaS inclusions after adding ferrosilicon alloy in the LF refining process as this alloy contains some CaSi alloy impurities. The addition of all ferrosilicon alloys required for the steel in the tapping process could eliminate the influence of Ca in ferrosilicon alloy on the compositions of inclusions. Si in liquid steel had a significant influence on the compositions of inclusions during LF refining when CaO-Al2O3-SiO2-MgO slag with high basicity of 7.0 was used. This was because [Ca] produced by the reaction of CaO and [Al] could be consumed more readily by SiO2 in Si-free steel than in Si-containing steel, which was confirmed by the difference of total calcium content between Si-free and Si-containing steels. As a result, Al2O3 and MgO center dot Al2O3 inclusions were retained in Si-free steel, whereas calcium aluminate inclusions were found in Si-containing steel. For CaO-Al2O3-SiO2-MgO slag with low basicity of 2.8, Al2O3 and MgO center dot Al2O3 inclusions were obtained after LF refining in Si-containing steel when all ferrosilicon alloys required for the steel were added in the tapping process. This was because the reaction of CaO and [Al] was weak, and residual [Ca] in the steel could be rapidly consumed by SiO2 in low-basicity slag owing to the low activity of CaO and high activity of SiO2, leading to a low total calcium content of 0.0003% in Si-containing steel.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			1006-706X	2210-3988		WOS:000522931100002

As the raw material of boron products, the reserve of szaibelyite ore is significantly depleted. Therefore, the comprehensive utilization of boron-bearing iron ore resources becomes more and more important. To study the reduction kinetics in depth, a boron-bearing iron concentrate containing 52.18% total iron and 5.50% B2O3 was reduced isothermally with coke as the reductant. The results showed that both the reduction degree and the maximum reduction rate increased with temperature and C/O molar ratio (fixed carbon in the coke to oxygen in iron oxides in the ore). 98.00% reduction degree and 0.00414 s(-1) maximum reduction rate were achieved at 1523K of reduction temperature and 1.4 of C/O molar ratio. The reduction kinetics can be best described by Avrami-Erofeev model, g(alpha) = [-ln(1-alpha)](3/2). The apparent activation energy and pre-exponential factor were 264.565 kJ center dot mol(-1) and 1.87 x 10(7) s(-1), respectively. The phase transformation observed by XRD agreed well with the results of reduction degree analysis. The micro-structure evolution behavior of the pellets was analyzed by SEM and EDS. As the reduction time increased from 0 to 600 s, most of the iron oxides were reduced to metallic iron, leaving other major elements in the slag phase. The slag phase mainly consisted of the solid solution of Mg2SiO4 and Mg3B2O6. With further increase to 1200 s, the metallic iron particles migrated and flocculated together forming bigger particles.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0882-7508	1547-7401		WOS:000465998000001

(1989) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 975, 44-49). Evidence is given which suggests that the three phases originate from different types of Photosystem II (PS II). In order to disclose the nature of the three phases, fluorescence inductions are measured with chloroplasts subjected to various modifying treatments. It is found that only the rapid alpha-phase responds to the depletion of Mg2+, the addition of ferricyanide and the variation in excitation light intensity. On the other hand, the slower beta- and gamma-phases are accelerated by adding electron donors like hydroxylamine. Inhibition of oxygen evolution by alkaline pH shift or Tris wash results in a partial conversion of the alpha-phase to the beta- and gamma-phases. The results are explained by the hypothesis that the alpha-phase represents the major 'normal' PS II centers, while the beta- and gamma-phases represent two minor groups of 'abnormal' PS II centers with low quantum efficiencies and which are rate-limited by their slow electron donation systems.									33	1	0	0	30	0	34			0006-3002			WOS:A1991EZ53300009

We present a conducting redox polymer (CRP) based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) with naphthoquinone pendant group, which is formed from a stable suspension of a trimeric precursor and an oxoammonium cation as oxidant. This suspension allows us to easily coat the polymer onto a current collector, opening up use of roll-to-roll processing or ink-jet printing for electrode preparation. The CRP showed a full capacity of 76 mAh g(-1) even at a high C rate of 100 C in acidic aqueous electrolyte. These properties make the CRP a promising candidate as anode-active material; a polymer-air secondary battery was fabricated with the CRP as anode, a conventional Pt/C catalyst as cathode, and sulfuric acid aqueous solution as electrolyte. This battery yielded a discharge voltage of 0.50 V and showed good cycling stability with 97 % capacity retention after 100 cycles and high rate capabilities up to 20 C.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000528810900001	32267605

Here, a synthetic pathway for fermentative production of glutarate by the actinobacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum has been developed. The pathway does not require molecular oxygen and operates via lysine decarboyxylase followed by two transamination and two NAD-dependent oxidation reactions. Using a genome-streamlined L-lysine producing strain as basis, metabolic engineering was performed to enable conversion of L-lysine to glutarate in a five-step synthetic pathway comprising lysine decarboxylase, putrescine transaminase and gamma-aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli and GABA/5AVA amino transferase and succinate/glutarate semialdehyde dehydrogenase either from C. glutamicum or from three Pseudomonas species. Loss of carbon via formation of the by-products cadaverine and N-acetylcadaverine was avoided by deletion of the respective acetylase and export genes. As the two transamination reactions in the synthetic glutarate biosynthesis pathway yield t--glutamate, biosynthesis of L-glutamate by glutamate dehydrogenase was expected to be obsolete and, indeed, deletion of its gene gdh increased glutarate titers by 10%. Glutarate production by the final strain was tested in bioreactors (n = 2) in order to investigate stability and reliability of the process. The most efficient glutarate production from glucose was achieved by fed-batch fermentation (n = 1) with a volumetric productivity of 0.32 g L-1 h(-1), an overall yield of 0.17 g g(-1) and a titer of 25 g L-1.									27	1	0	0	21	0	28			1664-302X			WOS:000448652400001	30425699

The algae emit bromoform (CHBr3) depending on the enzyme activity level in vivo (Itoh, N., Shinya, M., 1994. Seasonal evolution of bromomethanes from coralline algae and its effect on atmospheric ozone. Marine Chemistry 45, 95-103). We demonstrated that bromoform produced by C. pilulifera played an important role in eliminating epiphytic organisms, especially microalgae on the surface. Such data suggest a strong relationship between the coralline algae and the coralline flat (deforested area in the marine environment: called isoyake in Japanese). Lithophyllum yessoense, the main inhabitant of coralline flats in Japan, produced a lower level of CHBr3 than C. pilulifera, and showed BPO activity. On the other hand, the seasonal change of BPO activity in C. pilulifera in vivo was in proportion to superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and in inverse proportion to catalase activity. The phenomenon implies that BPO could be a potential substitute for catalase, because the enzyme catalyzes an efficient Br--dependent catalase reaction. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The basic environment within the electrolyzer, in principle, allows the use of non-platinum-group metal catalysts and less-expensive cell components compared to acidic-membrane systems. Nevertheless, AEMWEs are still underdeveloped, and the degradation and failure modes are not well understood. To improve performance and durability, supporting electrolytes such as KOH and K2CO3 are often added to the water feed. The effect of the anion interactions with the ionomer membrane (particularly other than OH-), however, remains poorly understood. We studied three commercial anion-exchange ionomers (Aemion, Sustainion, and PiperION) during oxygen evolution (OER) at oxidizing potentials in several supporting electrolytes and characterized their chemical stability with surface-sensitive techniques. We analyzed factors including the ionomer conductivity, redox potential, and pH tolerance to determine what governs ionomer stability during OER. Specifically, we discovered that the oxidation of Aemion at the electrode surface is favored in the presence of CO32-/HCO3- anions perhaps due to the poor conductivity of that ionomer in the carbonate/bicarbonate form. Sustainion tends to lose its charge-carrying groups as a result of electrochemical degradation favored in basic electrolytes. PiperION seems to be similarly negatively affected by a pH drop and low carbonate/bicarbonate conductivity under the applied oxidizing potential. The insight into the interactions of the supporting electrolyte anions with the ionomer/membrane helps shed light on some of the degradation pathways possible inside of the AEMWE and enables the informed design of materials for water electrolysis.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000812747000001	35435656

The reaction between RMs and Li metal degrades both the Li metal and the RMs, leading to cell deterioration within a few cycles. To extend the cycle life of redox-mediated Li-O-2 batteries, herein graphene oxide (GO) membranes are reported as RM-blocking separators. It is revealed that the size of GO nanochannels is narrow enough to reject 5,10-dihydro-5,10-dimethylphenazine (DMPZ) while selectively allowing the transport of smaller Li+ ions. The negative surface charges of GO further repel negative ions via Donnan exclusion, greatly improving the lithium ion transference number. The Li-O-2 cells with GO membranes efficiently harness the redox-mediation activity of DMPZ for improved performance, achieving energy efficiency of above 80% for more than 25 cycles, and 90% for 78 cycles when the capacity limits were 0.75 and 0.5 mAh cm(-2), respectively. Considering the facile preparation of GO membranes, RM-sieving GO membranes can be cost-effective and processable functional separators in Li-O-2 batteries.									26	2	0	0	0	0	26			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000442501500008	30062815

Thus, it finds potential applications in solar energy conversion and photocatalysis. However, Cu2O photocathodes suffer from a major issue of chemical stability and sluggish proton reduction for splitting water using sunlight. We present here a facile method of coating a thin MoS2 layer onto Cu2O to significantly improve its stability and proton reduction efficiency. MoS2 coating on top of Cu2O is achieved by spin coating a [Mo3S7(S2CNEt2)(3)]I precursor combined with a thermal annealing process to obtain the optimal stoichiometry. MoS2 thin films synthesized using this method show good prospects as both a protection layer and an electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) due to excellent stability and high electrocatalytic activity. The proton reduction performance of spin-coated MoS2/FTO electrodes is studied to determine the optimal synthesis conditions using various derivatives of MoS2 precursors. Our study suggests that the rate-limiting kinetic step of MoS2 synthesized in this method is the desorption of adsorbed hydrogen atoms to form molecular hydrogen, and that nanocrystalline MoS2 with copiously exposed S edges are more active for HER. Photoelectrochemical measurements demonstrate the highest activity for 3-layered (<40 nm thick) MoS2/Cu2O photocathode fabricated at 450 degrees C with a photocurrent density of approximate to 6.5 mA cm(-2) at -0.2 V vs. RHE. Additionally, the MoS2 coating helps minimize the dark current of the Cu2O photocathode.									28	1	0	0	2	0	28			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000433427300027

Here we reported an innovative hybrid of {110}oriented CeO2 nanorods with edge-enriched bicrystalline 1T/2H-MoS2 coupling as efficient photocatalysts for water splitting. In the composites, the metallic 1T phase acts as an excellent solid state electron mediator in the Z-scheme, while the 2H phase and CeO2 are the adsorption sites of the photosensitizer and reactant (H2O), respectively. Through optimal structure and phase engineering, 1T/2H-MoS2@CeO2 heterojunctions simultaneously achieve high charge separation efficiency, proliferated density of exposed active sites, and excellent affinity to reactant molecules, reaching a superior hydrogen evolution rate of 73.1 mu mol/h with an apparent quantum yield of 8.2% at 420 nm. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations show that 1T/2H-MoS2@CeO2 possesses the advantages of intensive electronic interaction from the built-in electric field (negative MoS2 and positive charged CeO2) and reduced H2O adsorption/dissociation energies. This work sheds light on the design of on-demand noble-metal-free Z-scheme heterostructures for solar energy conversion.									38	1	0	0	6	0	38			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000683741400053	34310105

In this work, atomically dispersed Fe, Pt dinuclear catalysts ((Fe, Pt) sA -N-C) with an ca. 2.38 A distance for Fe, (Fe-N-3) and Pt, (Pt-N-4) could be precisely controlled via a novel secondary-doping strategy. In response to tumor microenvironments, the Fe-N-3/Pt-N-4 moieties exhibited synergistic catalytic performance for tumor catalytic therapy. Due to its beneficial microstructure and abundant active sites, the Fe-N-3 moiety effectively initiated the intratumoral Fenton-like reaction to release a large amount of toxic hydroxyl radicals (*OH), which further induced tumor cell apoptosis. Meanwhile, the bonded PtN4 moiety could also enhance the Fenton-like activity of the Fe-N-3 moiety up to 128.8% by modulating the 3d electronic orbitals of isolated Fe-N-3 sites. In addition, the existence of amorphous carbon revealed high photothermal conversion efficiency when exposed to an 808 nm laser, which synergistically achieved an effective oncotherapy outcome. Therefore, the as-obtained (Fe, Pt) sA -N-C-FA-PEG has promising potential in the bio-nanomedicine field for inhibiting tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000813106300001	35471816

In the present work, Cu2Se-Co(OH)(2) nanotube array was achieved on Cu foam by using an aqueous in-situ construction method at ambient temperature. The synthetic process involves four steps of chemical reactions: sulfidation, etching, reduction and cobalt-growth. The arrays on Cu foam (CF) underwent successive unit transformations from Cu(OH)(2) nanorods to Cu2Se-Cu(OH)(2) nanorods, Cu2Se-Cu2O nanotubes and eventually to Cu2Se-Co(OH)(2) nanotubes. The combination of Co(OH)(2) nanoflakes and Cu2S nanotubes made the composite array/CF highly effective for OER, HER and overall water splitting applications. In an alkaline medium (1.0 mol dm(-3) KOH), the OER and HER overpotentials are 268 and 241 mV vs. RHE at the current density of 50 mA/cm(2) with excellent long-term stability of 48 h. The overall water splitting examination on Cu2Se-Co(OH)(2) nanotube array/CF catalyst gives superior electrochemical activity and high stability, where the over-potential is as low as 320 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA/cm(2), and the current density remained unchanged for 100 h. The combined composition and morphology catalyst of Cu2S nanotubes and Co(OH)(2) nanoflakes is promising for future practical applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, the role of AOX1A in optimizing photosynthesis was investigated when electron transport through the cytochrome c oxidase (COX) pathway was restricted at complex III.Methods Leaf discs of wild-type (WT) and aox1a knock-out mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana were treated with antimycin A (AA) under growth-light conditions. To identify the impact of AOX1A deficiency in optimizing photosynthesis, respiratory O-2 uptake and photosynthesis-related parameters were measured along with changes in redox couples, reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation and expression levels of genes related to respiration, the malate valve and the antioxidative system.Key Results In the absence of AA, aox1a knock-out mutants did not show any difference in physiological, biochemical or molecular parameters compared with WT. However, after AA treatment, aox1a plants showed a significant reduction in both respiratory O-2 uptake and NaHCO3-dependent O-2 evolution. Chlorophyll fluorescence and P700 studies revealed that in contrast to WT, aox1a knock-out plants were incapable of maintaining electron flow in the chloroplastic electron transport chain, and thereby inefficient heat dissipation (low non-photochemical quenching) was observed. Furthermore, aox1a mutants exhibited significant disturbances in cellular redox couples of NAD(P)H and ascorbate (Asc) and consequently accumulation of ROS and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. By contrast, WT plants showed a significant increase in transcript levels of CSD1, CAT1, sAPX, COX15 and AOX1A in contrast to aox1a mutants.Conclusions These results suggest that AOX1A plays a significant role in sustaining the chloroplastic redox state and energization to optimize photosynthesis by regulating cellular redox homeostasis and ROS generation when electron transport through the COX pathway is disturbed at complex III.

Strong evidence of a bicarbonate requirement for the water-oxidizing complex (WOC), both O-2 evolving and assembling from apo-WOC and Mn2+, of photosystem II (PSII) preparations has been presented in a number of publications during the last 5 years. The following explanations for the involvement of bicarbonate in the events on the donor side of PSII are considered: (1) bicarbonate serves as an electron donor (alternative to water or as a way of involvement of water molecules in the oxidative reactions) to the Mn-containing O-2 center; (2) bicarbonate facilitates reassembly of the WOC from apo-WOC and Mn2+ due to formation of the complexes Mn(HCO3)(+) and Mn(HCO3)(2) leading to an easier oxidation of Mn2+ with PSII; (3) bicarbonate is an integral component of the WOC essential for its function and stability; it may be considered a direct ligand to the Mn cluster; (4) the WOC is stabilized by bicarbonate through its binding to other components of PSII.

Standard metabolic rate (SMR) and maximal metabolic rate (MMR) are fundamental measures in ecology and evolution because they set the scope within which animals can perform activities that directly affect fitness. In ectotherms, both SMR and MMR are repeatable over time when measured at a single ambient temperature (T-a). 2. Many ectotherms encounter variable T-a from day to day and over their lifetime, yet it is currently unknown whether individual differences hold across an ecologically relevant range of T-a (i.e. thermal repeatability; R-T). Moreover, it is possible that thermal sensitivity of SMR and MMR are important individual attributes, and correlated with one another, but virtually nothing is known about this at present. 3. We measured SMR and MMR across an ecologically relevant T-a gradient (i.e. from 10 to 25 degrees C) in wild-caught salamanders (Plethodon albagula) and found that R-T was significant in both traits. SMR and MMR were also positively correlated, resulting in a lower R-T in absolute and factorial aerobic scopes (AAS and FAS). 4. We found significant individual differences in thermal sensitivity for both SMR and MMR, but not for AAS and FAS. The intercept (at T-a=0 degrees C) and the slope of the thermal reaction norms were negatively correlated; individuals with low MR at low T-a had a higher thermal sensitivity. Finally, individuals with a high thermal sensitivity for SMR also had high thermal sensitivity for MMR. 5. Our results suggest that natural selection occurring over variable T-a may efficiently target the overall level of - and thermal sensitivity in - SMR and MMR. However, this may not be the case for metabolic scopes, as the positive correlation between SMR and MMR, in addition to their combined changes in response to T-a, yielded little individual variation in AAS and FAS. 6. Our results support the idea that organisms with low metabolism at low T-a have a high metabolic thermal sensitivity as a compensatory mechanism to benefit in periods of warmer environmental conditions. Hence, our study reveals the importance of considering within-individual variation in metabolism, as it may represent additional sources of adaptive (co)variation.									47	0	0	0	46	0	47			0269-8463	1365-2435		WOS:000342615100013

The measured current density and applied-bias photon-to-current efficiency were 20.38 mA/cm(2) and 13.76%, respectively. These values were much higher than those reported previously for photoanodes with any kind of III-nitride nanostructure. The amount of hydrogen gas formed was 1.01 mmol/cm(2) from 7 h PEC-WS, which was also much higher than the previously reported values. The drastic improvement in the PEC-WS performance using the GaN-NW-WxS1-x photoanode was attributed to an increase in the number of photogenerated carriers due to the highly crystalline GaN NWs, and acceleration of separation of photogenerated carriers and consequent suppression of charge recombination because of nitrogen-terminated surfaces of NWs, sulfur vacancies in WxS1-x, and type-II band alignment between NW and WxS1-x. The degree of impedance matching, evaluated from Nyquist plots, was considered to analyze charge transfer characteristics at the interface between the GaN-NW-WxS1-x photoanode and 0.5-M H2SO4 electrolyte. Considering the material system and scheme for the PEC-WS, our approach provides an efficient way to improve hydrogen evolution reaction.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000605187100034	33337852

Electrochemical doping of TiO2 via cathodic polarization is an appealing preparation method and frequently employed. Here, we explored the electrochemical preparation of TiOx in an undivided cell using iridium-based (iridium mixed-metal-oxide) and boron doped diamond (BDD) counter electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy revealed superior charge transfer properties of crystalline TiOx electrodes prepared with BDD (TiOx-BDD). It is shown that the electrochemical properties correlate well with intensities of the H-signals determined using Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). Thus, it is concluded that electrochemical preparation using BDD causes favourable H+ intercalation and/or H diffusion into the sub-surface layers of TiOx. Our extensive analysis using a combination of electrochemical and surface characterization (LEIS and XPS) techniques, additionally suggests that cathodic deposition of Ir, originating from the Ir-based counter electrode, present in sub-ppm concentrations only results in less-efficient doping. Instead in the presence of sub-ppm level Ir contamination hydrogen evolution is favoured during cathodic polarization. The results presented within this study highlight the necessity to use inherently stable counter electrodes for electrochemical preparation and reveal the pronounced influence of trace contamination in electrochemistry in general and the doping mechanism of TiOx electrodes in particular.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000595349900003

With the emergence of antibiotic resistance, it is urgent to develop novel antimicrobial materials to efficiently overcome drug resistance with high bactericidal activity. In this work, UiO-66-NH-CO-MoS2 nanocomposites (UNMS NCs) are constructed through the amidation reaction. The UNMS NCs are positively charged which is beneficial for capturing and restricting bacteria. Significantly, UNMS NCs possess a synergistic bactericidal efficiency based on near-infrared irradiation (808 nm) regulated combination of photothermal, photodynamic, and peroxidase-like enzymatic activities. Both the photodynamic property and nanozymatic activity of UNMS NCs can lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species. The UNMS NCs show high catalytic activity in a wide pH range and exhibit excellent antibacterial ability against ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with negligible cytotoxicity. Interestingly, due to the 808 nm irradiation-induced hyperthermia in the presence of UNMS NCs, the glutathione oxidation process can be accelerated, resulting in bacterial death more easily. Mice wound models are established to further manifest that UNMS NCs can promote wound healing with good biosafety in living systems.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2192-2640	2192-2659		WOS:000697621500001	34549554

In search of a more sustainable catalyst other than platinum for the catalytic conversion of water to hydrogen gas, a series of nanoparticles of transition metals viz., Rh, Co, Fe, Pt and their composites with functionalized graphene such as RhNPs@f-graphene, CoNPs@f-graphene, PtNPs@f-graphene were synthesized and characterized by SEM and TEM techniques. The SEM analysis indicates that the texture of RhNPs@f-graphene resemble the dispersion of water droplets on lotus leaf. TEM analysis indicates that RhNPs of <10 nm diameter are dispersed on the surface of f-graphene. The air-stable NPs and nanocomposites were used as electrocatalyts for conversion of acidic water to hydrogen gas. The composite RhNPs@f-graphene catalyses hydrogen gas evolution from water containing p-toluene sulphonic acid (p-TsOH) at an onset reduction potential, E-p,E- -0.117V which is less than that of PtNPs@f-graphene (E-p,E- -0.380 V) under identical experimental conditions whereas the onset potential of CoNPs@f-graphene was at E-p,E- -0.97 V and the FeNPs@f-graphene displayed onset potential at E-p,E- -1.58 V. The pure rhodium nanoparticles, RhNPs also electrocatalyse at E-p,E- -0.186 V compared with that of PtNPs at E-p,E- -0.36 V and that of CoNPs at E-p,E- -0.98V. The electrocatalytic experiments also indicate that the RhNPs and RhNPs@f-graphene are stable, durable and they can be recycled in several catalytic experiments after washing with water and drying. The results indicate that RhNPs and RhNPs@f-graphene are better nanoelectrocatalysts than PtNPs and the reduction potentials were much higher in other transition metal nanoparticles. The mechanism could involve a hydridic species, Rh-H- followed by interaction with protons to form hydrogen gas.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2045-2322			WOS:000497701200015	31745221

The ground-based simulated atomic oxygen (AO) generator was employed. Results indicate that the CVD SiC coating exhibited improved radiation resistance properties against AO radiation as evidenced by a 16% better strength retention ratio, 60% less mass ablation, and increased strength stability. The magnitude of these influences affected the surface morphology, as observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and surface resistance meter test results. The variations in the surface constituents were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results. The main products left on surface after AO exposure are SiO2 and SiCxOy film. Additionally, Si atoms are found to be the preferential reacting element in the SiC coating, and this process is accompanied by graphite precipitation, grain growth, and crack necking. Also, the damage mechanism of the AO-exposed SiC coating was revealed and is discussed.

J	Wang, Zhenguo; Xu, Wangqiong; Yu, Ke; Feng, Yu; Zhu, Ziqiang								2D heterogeneous vanadium compound interfacial modulation enhanced synergistic catalytic hydrogen evolution for full pH range seawater splitting								NANOSCALE				12	10			6176	6187		10.1039/d0nr00207k				MAR 14 2020	2020	A novel electrocatalytic material VS2@V2C was proposed for the first time and successfully prepared by a one-step hydrothermal method. T-VS2 nanosheets were uniformly and vertically embedded on the V2C (MXene) matrix with a fewer layer structure. Owing to the fast charge transfer process at the interface of the two-phase structure and good conductivity, the composite material showed a lower hydrogen evolution overpotential and a very low Tafel slope in highly alkaline and highly acidic electrolytes (164 mV and 47.6 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH; 138 mV and 37.9 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4) under a current density of 20 mV cm(-2). More importantly, high-efficiency and stable electrolysis of seawater was achieved at a current density greater than 100 mA cm(-2), and the catalytic performance was significantly better than that of platinum-based alloys. First-principles calculations mechanically confirmed that VS2@V2C had higher carrier mobility and lower free energy of hydrogen adsorption. The VS2 nanosheets that grew outwards could provide support to avoid agglomeration on the catalyst surface and the edge sulfur sites of VS2 could promote the binding of adsorbed hydrogen atoms and the desorption of hydrogen molecules. Our work is expected to provide a valuable reference for the design and synthesis of the structure of industrial catalysts for hydrogen production from seawater in the future.									37	4	0	0	3	0	37			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000520487300043	32133477

Hydrogeochemical and environmental isotope data for groundwater in the study area suggested the occurrence of two distinct water types, a Ca-HCO3 type and a Na-HCO3 type. The former water type is characterized by relatively high concentrations of Ca, SO4 and NO3, which show significant temporal variation indicating a strong influence by surface processes. In contrast, the Na-HCO3 type waters have high and temporally constant temperature, pH, TDS, Na, Cl, HCO3 and F, indicating the attainment of a chemical steady state with respect to the host rocks (granite and gneiss). Oxygen, hydrogen and tritium isotope data also indicate the differences in hydrologic conditions between the two groups: the relatively lower delta O-18, delta D and tritium values for Na-HCO3 type waters suggest that they recharged at higher elevations and have comparatively long mean residence times. Considering the geologic and hydrogeologic conditions of the study area, Na-HCO3 type waters possibly have evolved from Ca-HCO3 type waters. Mass balance modeling revealed that the chemistry of Na-HCO3 type water was regulated by dissolution of silicates and carbonates and concurrent ion exchange. Particularly, low Ca concentrations in Na-HCO3 water was mainly caused by cation exchange. Multivariate mixing and mass balance modeling (M3 modeling) was performed to evaluate the hydrologic mixing and mass transfer between discrete water masses occuring in the shallow peripheral part of the central spa-land area, where hydraulic upwelling occurs. Based on Q-mode factor analysis and mixing modeling using PHREEQC, an ideal mixing among three major water masses (surface water, shallow groundwater of Ca-HCO3 type, deep groundwater of Na-HCO3 type) was proposed. M3 modeling suggests that all the groundwaters in the spa area can be described as mixtures of these end-members. After mixing, the net mole transfer by geochemical reaction was less than that without mixing. Therefore, it is likely that in the hydraulic mixing zone geochemical reactions are of minor importance and, therefore, that mixing regulates the groundwater geochemistry. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Highly ordered self-assembled supramolecular nanostructures aim to emulate natural light-harvesting and energy transfer and electron transfer processes, which have been an active and rapidly developing field for visible-light-driven photocatalytic applications. This Research Update aims to present the recent progress of the self-assembly of pi -conjugated molecules, including perylene diimides (PDIs), porphyrin, and co-assembly of peptide-porphyrin as well as the shape-defined functional hierarchical structures. First, the basic principles of pi -conjugated molecular structure design are described. The two nitrogen positions and the bay positions of PDIs can effectively regulate their electronic properties and geometric skeleton, and the functional groups and the good solvents of porphyrin effectively determine the choice of self-assembly methods. Then, the key morphology dependent optoelectronic properties and charge-transport and energy-transport functionalities are also discussed. These self-assembled supramolecular nanostructures' inherent optoelectronic properties correlated with applications in photocatalytic water splitting into hydrogen evolution are overviewed. By now, the self-assembled In(III) meso-tetraphenylporphine (InTPP) porphyrin nanostructures exhibited the highest photocatalytic hydrogen generation activity among the reported supramolecular nanostructures owing to the central metal of porphyrin and small size of the InTPP nanostructure. Finally, perspectives on the crucial issues and potential future research directions are addressed. This Research Update will provide a new reference for building high performance, stable, and durable photosensitizers based on the supramolecular assembly.									7	0	0	0	1	1	8			2166-532X			WOS:000604144200001

VNN causes 100% mortality in the larval stages, while lower losses have been reported in juvenile and adult fish. This study aimed to detect the occurrence of VNN while identifying its associated risk factors and the genotypes of its causative agent in a hybrid grouper hatchery in Malaysia.Materials and Methods: A batch of newly hatched hybrid grouper fly (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus x Epinephelus lanceolatus) were followed from the larval stage to market size. Samples of the hybrid groupers, water, live feed. and artificial fish pellets were collected periodically from day 0 to 180 in the hybrid grouper hatchery. Reverse transcription-poly merase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and nested PCR amplifications were carried out on VNN-related sequences. The phylogenetic tree including the sampled causative agent of VNN was inferred from the coat protein genes from all known Betanodavirus species using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA). Pearson's correlation coefficient values were calculated to determine the strength of the correlation between the presence of VNN in hybrid grouper samples and its associated risk factors.Results: A total of 113 out of 146 pooled and individual samples. including hybrid grouper. water. and artificial fish pellet samples, demonstrated positive results in tests for the presence of VNN-associated viruses. The clinical signs of infection observed in the samples included darkened skin, deformation of the backbone, abdominal distension, skin lesions, and fin erosion. VNN was present throughout the life stages of the hybrid groupers, with the first detection occurring at day 10. VNN-associated risk factors included water temperature. dissolved oxygen content, salinity, ammonia level, fish size (adults more at risk than younger stages), and life stage (age). Detection of VNN-associated viruses in water samples demonstrated evidence of horizontal transmission of the disease. All the nucleotide sequences found in this study had high nucleotide identities of 88% to 100% to each other, striped jack nervous necrosis virus (SJNNV), and the reassortant strain red-spotted grouper NNV/SJNNV (RGNNV/SJNNV) isolate 430.2004 (GenBank accession number JN189932.1) (n=26). The phylogenetic analysis showed that quasispecies was present in each VNN-causing virus-positive sample, which differed based on the type of sample and life stage.Conclusion: This study was the first to confirm the existence of a reassortant strain (RGNNV/SJNNV) in hybrid groupers from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. However. the association between the mode of transmission and the risk factors of this virus needs to be investigated further to understand the evolution and potential new host species of the reassortant strain.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0972-8988	2231-0916		WOS:000482666100013	31641308

However, large scale production of hematite thin films with efficient PEC performance is a challenging problem in the field. In this article, based on an electron beam evaporation method, we provide a scalable route for preparation of a Co-Pi modified hematite thin film with efficient solar water oxidation properties. To our knowledge, no work has been done on photoelectrochemical characterization of Co-Pi modified hematite films prepared based on electron beam evaporation. We show that by optimization of deposition conditions including the film thickness and annealing temperature and performing the deposition in an oxygen medium, an efficient PEC performance is achieved from the produced pristine hematite photoanode. By various characterizations including XRD, EDX, SEM, transient photocurrent and I-V measurements, and impedance spectroscopy, it is shown that the efficient performance is attributed to the improved crystalline structure and suppression of recombination centres originated from the defects in bulk and surface of the hematite layer. Also with deposition of different thicknesses of Co-Pi electro-catalysts on the hematite layer, the optimum structure for fast water oxidation and charge transfer kinetics across the interface of the photoanode and electrolyte is obtained. The most efficient photoanode delivers up to 1.5 (mA cm(-2)) at the potential of 1.5 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is among the large value photocurrents attained from a hematite-based photoanode, but with the advantage of large scale production capability of the proposed method of this work.									50	0	0	0	1	0	50			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000395077600039

In the present study, the molecular and physico-chemical properties (redox-potential and secondary structures) of fungal laccase iso-zymes (FLIs) isolated from a medicinal mushroom Ganoderma lucidum were analyzed and compared with those of the recombinant bacterial laccases (rLac) obtained from different Yersinia enterocolitica strains. It was revealed that the FLIs contained His-Cys-His as the most conserved residue in its domain I Cu site, while the fourth and fifth residues were variable (Ile, Leu, or Phe). Evidently, the cyclic voltammetric measurements of Glac L2 at Type 1 Cu site revealed greater E degrees for ABTS/ABTS(+) (0.312 V) and ABTS(+)/ABTS(2+) (0.773 V) compared to the E degrees of rLac. Furthermore, circular dichroism-based conformational analysis revealed structural stability of the FLIs at acidic pH (3.0) and low temperature (<30 degrees C), while the isozymes were destabilized at neutral pH ( 7.0) and high-temperature conditions (>70 degrees C). The zymographic studies further confirmed the functional inactivation of FLIs at high temperatures (>= 70 degrees C), predominantly due to domain unfolding. These findings provide novel insight into the evolution of the catalytic efficiency and redox properties of the FLIs, contributing to the existing knowledge regarding stress responses, metabolite production, and the biotechnological utilization of metabolites.

In the present study, an arginine kinase (designated CgAK) was isolated by the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) affinity chromatography from the haemolymph of Crassostrea gigas. CgAK could directly bind to LPS in a concentration-dependent manner with the dissociation constant (Kd) of 2.46 x 10(-6) M. The interaction with LPS significantly decreased the ATP hydrolytic activity of CgAK, which in turn lead to the accumulation of ATP in vitro. The extracellular ATP stimulation could induce Ca2+ influx, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and the release of lysosomal enzyme in the cellular immune response. In addition, ATP stimulation provoked the bactericidal activity towards Escherichia coli, and the scavenging ROS with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) abrogated the bactericidal activity, indicating that ATP stimulation could induce ROS-dependent antimicrobial activity in haemocytes. Collectively, the results demonstrated that the haemolymph CgAK could serve as an important purinergic regulator to modulate extracellular ATP, which might further have an important effect on the purinergic signaling-activated innate immune response of oyster.

In this article, we systematically reviewed the roles of insect saliva effectors and elicitors in the interactions between insects and plants and their mechanisms. The salivary elicitors secreted by insects during feeding can be recognized by plants to trigger early plant immunity, while insect effectors released from oral secretion can inhibit plant immune defenses. Resistant plants further evolved R proteins to recognize insect avirulence effectors and initiate effector-triggered immunity. Phytophagous insects can avoid the recognition by plant R proteins through different strategies. Therefore, in this arms race, insect saliva determines whether insects can succeed to feed on plants. During feeding process, chewing insects secrete a large number of enzymes into plants, and piercing-sucking insects secrete sheath saliva and water saliva into plants, but both of them utilize effectors and elicitors to manipulate plant immune responses. By analyzing the reported insect effectors, it was found that the molecular mechanisms of insect effectors are different. They affect plant early defense signals, regulate plant hormone pathways or others, or target small RNA pathways. Recent advances in insect elicitors were also reviewed in this article, revealing that elicitors can induce the release of plant secondary metabolites, and regulate hormone levels, Ca~(2+) influx and reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst to enhance plant resistance. Finally, we analyzed the secretory characteristics, host specificity and multifunctionality of insect effectors, and discussed research prospects on avirulence effectors and their plant R genes as well as pattern recognition receptors of elicitors.			植食性昆虫与寄主植物通过协同进化形成了复杂的防御和反防御机制。本文系统综述了昆虫唾液效应子和激发子在植物与昆虫互作中的作用及机理。昆虫取食中释放的唾液激发子被植物识别而激活植物早期免疫反应,昆虫也能从口腔分泌效应子到植物体内抑制免疫;抗性植物则利用抗性(R)蛋白识别昆虫无毒效应子,启动效应子诱导的免疫反应,而昆虫又进化出多种方式来躲避植物R蛋白的识别。总之,在这场军备竞赛中,昆虫的唾液成分决定着昆虫能否取食成功。取食过程中,咀嚼式口器害虫分泌大量酶类到植物体内,而刺吸式害虫则分泌胶状和水样唾液到植物中,它们都利用激发子和效应子去调控植物的免疫防御反应。分析现已报道的昆虫效应子发现其作用机制各有不同,具体表现为影响植物早期防御信号,调控植物激素通路及其他通路,或靶向小分子RNA通路。本文还综述了昆虫激发子的最新进展,揭示激发子可以通过诱导释放植物次生代谢物以及调控激素水平、Ca~(2+)内流和活性氧爆发增强植物抗性。最后对昆虫效应子的分泌特性、寄主特异性和多功能性作了分析,并对无毒效应子及其对应的植物R基因,以及激发子的模式识别受体的研究进行了展望。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0454-6296			CSCD:7044847

Either polyoxometalate (POM) or FeCl3 was used as the catalyst and charge-transfer agent at the anode. Over 90% Faraday efficiency was achieved. In a thermal-insulation reactor, the heat energy could be maintained at a very low level for continuous operation. Compared to the best alkaline-water electrolysis reported in literature, the electrical-energy consumption could be 40% lower with lignin electrolysis. At the anode, the Kraft lignin (KL) was oxidized to aromatic chemicals by POM or FeCl3, and reduced POM or Fe ions were regenerated during the electrolysis. Structure analysis of the residual KL indicated a reduction of the amount of hydroxyl groups and the cleavage of ether bonds. The results suggest that POM-or FeCl3-mediated electrolysis can significantly reduce the electrolysis energy consumption in hydrogen production and, simultaneously, depolymerize lignin to low-molecular-weight value-added aromatic chemicals.									47	7	0	0	5	0	52			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000398182300006	28102938

The total reduction capacity of CWFs, encompassing contributions from both S and Fe reductants, and its implications toward radionuclide immobilization is most often studied by destructive wet chemistry methods requiring acid digestion in the presence of Ce(IV) and subsequent titration and colorimetric interpretation. Here, we investigate a similarly analytical but nondestructive alternative, benchtop high resolution wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, most commonly known as X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES), for probing the bulk sulfur oxidation state distribution. We present here an initial investigation of S XES, including an improved experimental protocol for lab XES of inhomogeneous samples, both as a complement to the Ce(IV) test and for new scientific opportunities that it enables for observing changes in sulfur chemistry. We discuss future improvements and opportunities, including: (1) the practical challenges associated with coordinating XES and Ce(IV) liquid extraction for a more comprehensive perspective on reduction capacity and for a high-precision evaluation of uncertainties in the Ce(IV) test; and (2) new opportunities, due to the nondestructive nature of XES, for controlled evolution studies aimed at elucidating specific chemical responses of CWFs exposed to invasive gas or liquid species or to accelerated aging by radiative dose or thermal treatment.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0049-8246	1097-4539		WOS:000730316400001

Herein, a mixed titanium oxide strategy, utilizing TiO2/Ti2O3 heterostructures consisting of in situ grown TiO2 nanotubes with mixed anatase and rutile phases on bulk Ti2O3 materials, is demonstrated for efficient and recyclable hydrogen evolution from photocatalytic water splitting. Taking advantage of the formed heterostructures and the created porous structures, the photogenerated electrons from the conduction band of anatase TiO2 can be first delivered to rutile TiO2 and then transferred to Ti2O3. Meanwhile, the presence of Ti(2)O3 in TiO2/Ti2O3 heterostructures can substantially promote the charge mobility and suppress the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Hence, with a tuned band gap structure that enables rapid electron-hole separation, increased charge carrier density, and enhanced light absorption, the TiO2/Ti2O3 heterostructures provide an enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate as high as 1440 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) under full-sunlight irradiation and without any other cocatalyst. This mixed titanium oxide strategy may open up new avenues for designing and constructing highly efficient TiO2-based photocatalytic materials for various applications.									26	3	0	0	1	0	26			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000469288300043	31046226

Nevertheless, the severe agglomeration of single-component bimetallic phosphides hinders their extensive applications. Moreover, current research lacks in-depth studies on the effect of outer/inter-component synergy on the rate capability. In this study, novel nickel cobalt phosphide nanowires on two-dimensional graphene oxide nanosheets (GO@NiCoP) were designed and prepared by combining a hydrothermal process and phosphorization. GO served as the conductive path to improve the composite conductivity and provided abundant oxygen-containing functional groups to coordinate with the metal cations of NiCoP, thereby boosting the overall structural stability. NiCoP possesses an optimal intercomponent synergistic effect, such as an optimal -OH- adsorption energy and deprotonation energy, leading to an enhanced potential of the electrochemical reaction. Taking advantage of these materials, the GO@NiCoP electrode displayed a high specific capacitance of 1125 F g(-1) (155 mA h g(-1)) at 2 A g(-1) and a high cycling stability of 104.88% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 30 A g(-1). Interestingly, the GO@NiCoP electrode delivered an exceptional rate capability of 84.09% capacitance retention at 20 A g(-1) and 39.77% capacitance retention at 60 A g(-1) owing to its stable structure and excellent conductivity. In addition, we fabricated a GO@NiCoP//AG ASC device that delivered a desirable energy density of 27.71 W h kg(-1) at 788 W kg(-1). To broaden its applications, a self-charging power system with a satisfactory lighting time was constructed using the ASC device. In short, the outstanding electrochemical performance of the electrode materials provides a novel perspective for enhancing the rate capacity of electrode materials by the outer/inter-component synergistic effect.									95	6	0	0	3	0	95			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000511170800063		
J	Schiener, M. A.; Lindstedt, R. P.					Lindstedt, Peter/0000-0002-6176-2733			Transported probability density function based modelling of soot particle size distributions in non-premixed turbulent jet flames								PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMBUSTION INSTITUTE				37	1			1049	1056		10.1016/j.proci.2018.06.088				2019	2019	The need to establish actual particle size distributions (PSDs) of soot emissions from the nanoscale upwards, along with the current global indicators based on soot mass, stems from increasingly strict regulatory demands. In the current work, a mass and number density preserving sectional model is coupled with a transported probability density function (PDF) method to study the evolution of soot PSDs in two non-premixed turbulent jet flames at Reynolds numbers of 10,000 and 20,000. The transported PDF approach is closed at joint-scalar level and includes mass fractions of gas phase species, soot sections, as well as enthalpy, leading to a fully coupled 78-dimensional joint-scalar space, treating interactions between turbulence and gas phase/soot chemistry as well as radiation without further approximation. The gas phase chemistry features 144 reactions, 15 solved and 14 steady-state species and an acetylene-based soot inception model is calibrated using comprehensive detailed chemistry up to pyrene and applied to a well-stirred/plug flow reactor configuration. The derived nucleation rate is subsequently applied in the turbulent flame calculations. Soot surface growth is treated via a PAH analogy and oxidation via O, OH and O-2 is accounted for. The sectional model features 62 sections covering particle sizes in the range 0.38 nm <= d(p) <= 4.4 mu m and includes a model for the collision efficiency of small particles ( <= 10 nm) based on the Lennard-Jones potential. The computed results reproduce the evolution of the PSDs with encouraging accuracy. It is also shown that the distribution of soot in mixture fraction space is affected by local extinction events.

The qualitative oxidation of arc-melted Mo(Al0.1Si0.9)(2), Mo(Al0.3Si0.7)(2), Mo(Al0.5Si0.5)(2), and Mo3Al8 was examined after 600degreesC for 1000 h in air. At all temperatures, the compositional difference between the materials yielded very different oxidation rates and scale microstructures. At 1400degrees and 1500degreesC, microstructural evolution of the oxide scales resulted in improved oxidation resistance at long times (>400 h). At these temperatures, a significant reduction in the long-time oxidation kinetics was correlated with the in situ formation of an inner mullite scale. At 480degrees and 600degreesC, oxidation resistance improved significantly with increasing aluminum concentration. Contrary to the behavior of MoSi2, samples of Mo(Al0.01Si0.99)(2) did not demonstrate catastrophic oxidation, and samples of Mo(Al0.1Si0.9)(2) were very oxidation resistant.									28	2	0	0	0	0	30			0002-7820			WOS:000173859800023		
J	Christen, G; Renger, G								The role of hydrogen bonds for the multiphasic P680(+center dot) reduction by Y-z in photosystem II with intact oxygen evolution capacity. Analysis of kinetic H/D isotope exchange effects								BIOCHEMISTRY				38	7			2068	2077		10.1021/bi982188t				FEB 16 1999	1999	The mechanism of multiphasic P680(+.) reduction by Yz has been analyzed by studying H/D isotope exchange effects on flash-induced changes of 830 nm absorption, Delta A(830)(t), and normalized fluorescence yield, F(t)/F-0, in dark-adapted thylakoids and PS II membrane fragments from spinach. It was found that (a) the characteristic period four oscillations of the normalized components of Delta A(830)(t) relaxation and of F(t)/F-0 rise in the nanosecond and microsecond time domain are significantly modified when exchangeable protons are replaced by deuterons; (b) in marked contrast to the normalized steady-state extent of the microsecond kinetics of 830 nm absorption changes which increases only slightly due to H/D exchange (about 10%) the S-i state-dependent pattern exhibits marked effects that are most pronounced after the first, fourth, fifth, and eighth flashes; (c) regardless of data evaluation by different fit procedures the results lead to a consistent conclusion, that is, the relative extent of the back reaction between P680(+.)Q(A)(-.) becomes enhanced in samples suspended in D2O; and (d) this enhancement is dependent on the S-i state of the WOC and attains maximum values in S-2 and S-3, most likely due to a retardation of the "35 mu s kinetics" of P680(+.) reduction. In an extension of our previous suggestion on the functional role of hydrogen bonding of Y-Z by a basic group X (Eckert, H.-J., and Renger, G. (1988) FEES Lett. 236, 425-431), a model is proposed for the origin of the multiphasic P680(+.) reduction by Y-Z. Two types of different processes are involved: (a) electron transfer in the nanosecond time domain is determined by strength and geometry of the hydrogen bond between the O-H group of Y-Z and acceptor X, and (b) the microsecond kinetics reflect relaxation processes of a hydrogen bond network giving rise to a shift of the equilibrium P680(+.)Y(Z) reversible arrow P680Y(Z)(OX) toward the right side. The implications of this model are discussed.									79	1	0	0	58	0	80			0006-2960			WOS:000079117500012	10026289

Chemokines signal through binding to their receptors that are a superfamily of seven-transmembrane domain G-coupled receptors. Recently, a complete repertoire of both CC and CXC chemokines have been identified in channel catfish, but nothing is known about their receptors. In this study, a set of 29 CC chemokine receptor (CCR) genes and 8 CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR) genes were identified and annotated from the channel catfish genome. Extensive phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses were conducted to annotate these genes, revealing fish-specific CC chemokine receptors, and lineage-specific tandem duplications of chemokine receptors in the teleost genomes. With 29 genes, the channel catfish genome harbors the largest numbers of CC chemokine receptors among all the genomes characterized. Analysis of gene expression after bacterial infections indicated that the chemokine receptors were regulated in a gene-specific manner. Most differentially expressed chemokine receptors were up-regulated after Edwardsiella ictaluri and Flavobacterium columnare infection. Among which, CXCR3 and CXCR4 were observed to participate in immune responses to both bacterial infections, indicating their potential roles in catfish immune activities. In addition, CXCR3.2 was significantly up regulated in ESC-susceptible fish, and CXCR4b was mildly induced in ESC-resistant fish, further supporting the significant roles of CXCR3 and CXCR4 in catfish immune responses. CXCR4b and CCR9a were both up-regulated not only after bacterial infection, but also after hypoxia stress, providing the linkage between bacterial infection and low oxygen stresses. These results should be valuable for comparative immunological studies and provide insights into their roles in disease and stress responses. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Loukola-Ruskeeniemi, Kirsti/0000-0003-0792-4487			Reactions of hydrothermal solutions with organic matter in Paleoproterozoic black shales at Talvivaara, Finland: Evidence from multiple sulfur isotopes								EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS				367				1	14		10.1016/j.epsl.2013.02.004				APR 1 2013	2013	Stable isotopic studies of Archean-Paleoproterozoic sedimentary rocks older than 2.4 Ga have documented large mass-anomalous fractionations of sulfur isotopes (Delta S-33 = > 0 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand), while younger rocks record little to no anomalous fractionation of sulfur isotopes. This change from large anomalous fractionations to sulfur isotope values that fall on the terrestrial fractionation line has been proposed to represent the transition from an essentially anoxic Archean atmosphere to an oxygenated atmosphere. Here we present delta S-34 and delta S-33 data for 28 core samples from Paleoproterozoic (2.1-1.9 Ga) metamorphosed black shales and associated sulfide ores in eastern Finland. Previous delta S-34 of studies of the Talvivaara and Outokumpu deposits of eastern Finland focused on single-grain analyses of sulfides, while this study presents data from sequentially extracted sulfur fractions (e.g., acid-soluble sulfides, chrome-reducible sulfides, elemental sulfur). The sulfur isotope results range between +16.6 and -11.6 parts per thousand for delta S-34, +8.6 and -6.0 parts per thousand for delta S-33, and +1.25 and -0.55 parts per thousand for Delta S-33. The anomalously fractionated samples are not consistent with previous findings that large anomalous fractionations of sulfur isotopes are absent in sedimentary/metasedimentary rocks younger than 2.4 Ga. It is unlikely that Talvivaara sulfides are the products of ultraviolet photolysis of volcanic SO2 in an oxygen-poor atmosphere. Alternatively, these sulfides could in part be the products of diagenetic reactions between sediments enriched in organic matter (C-org) and hydrothermal solutions rich in sulfate (i.e., thermochemical sulfate reduction). Laboratory experiments on thermochemical sulfate-reduction have shown that mass-anomalous fractionations of sulfur isotopes can be recorded in reduced-sulfur products from reactions between simple amino acids and sulfate at 150-300 degrees C. A thermochemical sulfate-reduction pathway for the mass-anomalous signatures in Talvivaara samples is consistent with previous genetic models proposed for the origin of the sulfur- and organic carbon-rich black shales (now schists) associated with the Talvivaara and Outokumpu ore deposits. At Talvivaara metalliferous black shales apparently were deposited under an anoxic to sulfidic marine water column. The reported multiple sulfur-isotopic data are key geological evidence for mass-anomalous fractionations of sulfur isotopes during hydrothermal alteration of fine-grained organic-rich sediments. Approximately 20% of samples in this study show large offsets in Delta S-33 values between different extracted sulfur fractions from the same sample, which can be explained by classical isotope effects associated with the formation of hydrothermal alteration products that predominantly are retained within the precursor fine-grained organic-rich units.

To explore its potential roles in crustaceans' immune responses we have identified and characterized LvPHB2, a 891 bp gene encoding a 297 amino acids protein in the shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. Expression analyses showed that LvPHB2 is expressed in all examined tissues, and largely present in cytoplasm, correlating with its known anti-oxidation function in mitochondria. Luciferase reporter assays showed that over expression of LvPHB2 could activate the p53 pathway, indicating that it might participate in apoptosis regulation. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that infection with Vibrio alginolyticus induces its up regulation in hepatopancreas. Moreover, RNAi knock-down of LvPHB2 in vivo raises mortality rates of L. vannamei infected by V. alginolyticus, and affects expression of STAT3, Caspase3 and p53 genes. We found significantly higher reactive oxygen species production, DNA damage and apoptosis rates in LvPHB2-silenced shrimp challenged with V. alginolyticus than in controls injected with a Green Fluorescent Protein-silencing construct. Our results suggest that LvPHB2 plays a vital role in shrimp responses to V. alginolyticus infection through its participation in regulation of oxidants and apoptosis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Fu, Cenfeng; Yang, Jinlong				Yang, Jinlong/D-3465-2009				Theoretical advances in two-dimensional materials for photocatalytic water splitting								CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE				66	6			591	605		10.1360/TB-2020-1039				2021	2021	Currently, the energy and environment associated problems become more and more serious. Hydrogen is a kind of clean and renewable resource. Hydrogen generation through photocatalytic water splitting is a feasible and efficient route to resolve these problems. In general, the photocatalytic water splitting process is composed of three pivotal steps: Light harvest, carrier separation and transportation, and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as well as oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Improving the efficiencies of these three steps are keys to enhance the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency, which stimulates the development of high-performance photocatalysts. Typically, for two-dimensional (2D) materials, the photogenerated electrons and holes produce directly from the surfaces of 2D materials with atomic thickness. In addition, compared with their bulk counterparts, 2D materials with an extremely large specific surface area, rather high carrier mobility, and controllable interfaces offer a large number of advantages for the photocatalysts exploration. Thus, search and design of 2D photocatalysts for water splitting has been a hot topic. Density functional theory (DFT) based first-principles calculations is a powerful tool for materials design and has been widely used in exploring 2D photocatalysts for water splitting. Here, recent advances in the design of 2D materials for photocatalytic water splitting are presented from a theoretical perspective.In the initial stage, a great of new 2D photocatalysts for water splitting are expected to be discovered. Mechanical and chemical assisted exfoliation of layered materials is straightforward approaches to get access to single-layer and few-layer 2D materials. By using DFT calculations, many potential 2D photocatalysts are screened out for water splitting. In addition, molecular designing and chemical regulating are alternative approaches for exploring new 2D photocatalysts for water splitting.The light harvest is the initial process of photocatalytic water splitting, and increasing the light adsorption is one of keys to enhance the STH efficiency. Generally, there are two ways for enhancing the light harvest of 2D materials. One strategy is designing and constructing new 2D materials for photocatalytic water splitting. The other one is improving the light harvest by regulating 2D materials that have been reported previously. Both of the two strategies are employed for developing 2D visible-light-driven covalent organic frameworks for photocatalytic water splitting.Improving the separation of the photo-generated electrons and holes is another key to enhance the STH efficiency. The development of (type-II and Z-scheme) heterojunctions provides a feasible way to design high performance photocatalysts for water splitting due to the benefit for inhibiting electron-hole recombination. That is because that the HER and OER occur on different materials. By using first-principles calculations, a variety of 2D materials based heterojunctions with an expectation of designing highly efficient photocatalytic 2D materials for water splitting have been developed.The STH efficiency is determined by the product of the efficiencies of all the steps for photocatalytic water splitting. Thus, the successful enhancement of energy conversion efficiency calls for the simultaneous improvement for the light harvest and electron-hole separation. A new mechanism for photocatalytic water splitting reveals that the vertical intrinsic electric field in 2D material not only accelerates the carrier separation, but also breaks the conventional limitation of 1.23 eV for band gap of photocatalysts, leading to enlarged light absorption, even to infrared region. Referring to this new mechanism, some 2D materials with vertical electric field have been theoretically proved to be potential photocatalysts for water splitting.In additional, future opportunities and challenges in theoretical design of 2D photocatalysts toward water splitting are also included.									1	1	0	0	0	0	1			0023-074X	2095-9419		WOS:000628672500006

The new material was then used to improve the performance of Fenton oxidation of real biologically pretreated coal gasification wastewater (CGW). The results indicated that the prepared FeOx/SBAC significantly enhanced the pollutant removal performance in the Fenton process, so that the treated wastewater was more biodegradable and less toxic. The best performance was obtained over a wide pH range from 2 to 7, temperature 30 degrees C, 15 mg/L of H2O2 and 1 g/L of catalyst, and the treated effluent concentrations of COD, total phenols, BOD5 and TOC all met the discharge limits in China. Meanwhile, on the basis of significant inhibition by a radical scavenger in the heterogeneous Fenton process as well as the evolution of FT-IR spectra of pollutant-saturated FeOx/BAC with and without H2O2, it was deduced that the catalytic activity was responsible for generating hydroxyl radicals, and a possible reaction pathway and interface mechanism were proposed. Moreover, FeOx/SBAC showed superior stability over five successive oxidation runs. Thus, heterogeneous Fenton oxidation of biologically pretreated CGW by FeOx/SBAC, with the advantages of being economical, efficient and sustainable, holds promise for engineering application.

(1999) Biochemistry 38, 404-414; Zubrzycki et al. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 13553-13558]. The C-terminal tripeptide of Manganese Stabilizing Protein was shown to be critical for binding to photosystem II and restoration of O-2 evolution activity [Betts et al. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 14230-14236]. Here, we report new biochemical, hydrodynamic, and spectroscopic data on mutants E246K, E246STOP, L245E, L245STOP, and Q244STOP. Truncation of the final dipeptide (E246STOP) or substitution of Glu246 with Lys resulted in no significant changes in secondary and tertiary structures of Manganese Stabilizing Protein as monitored by CD spectroscopy. The apparent molecular mass of the protein remained unchanged, both mutants were able to rebind to photosystem II, and both proteins reactivate Oz evolution. Manganese Stabilizing Protein lacking the final tripeptide (L245STOP), or substitution of Glu for Leu245 dramatically modified the protein's solution structure. The apparent molecular masses of these mutants increased significantly, which might indicate unfolding of the protein in solution. This was verified by CD spectroscopy. Both mutant proteins rebound to photosystem II with lower affinities, and activation of Oz evolution was decreased dramatically. Enhancement of these defects was observed upon removal of the final tetrapeptide (Q244STOP). These results indicate that Leu245 is essential to maintaining Manganese Stabilizing Protein's solution structure in a conformation that promotes efficient binding to photosystem II and/or for the subsequent steps that lead to enzyme activation. Based on an analysis of the properties of C-terminal mutations, a hypothesis for structural requirements for functional binding of Manganese Stabilizing Protein to photosystem II is presented. Effects of C-terminal mutations on the UV spectrum of Manganese Stabilizing Protein were also examined. Mutations that alter solution structure also affect a 293 nm absorption shoulder which is assigned to the only tryptophan residue, Trp241, in the protein, and this absorbance feature is shown to be a useful indicator of alterations to the Trp241 environment.									34	3	0	0	31	0	36			0006-2960			WOS:000084016800014	10569936

The results showed that (1) the mining activities of the open-pit coal changed the original reduction environment into the oxidizing environment in the mining area. The pyrite and sulfur-bearing coal in the stratum oxidized, produced acid and triggered a series of subsequent reactions, resulting in the decrease in the pH value of the groundwater in the mining area. The concentration of SO42-, Fe2+, Fe3+, Ca(2+)and Mg(2+)and the total hardness increased. The regional hydrochemical type evolved from HCO3-Na center dot Ca center dot Mg type before mining to the type of HCO3 center dot SO4-Na center dot Ca center dot Mg after mining. (2) Coal mining strongly draining underground water accelerated the regional groundwater circulation, and then made the groundwater desalination. The concentrations of TDS, COD and Na++K(+)in the mining area all showed a decreasing trend. (3) The coal mining activities made the calcite and dolomite in saturated state under the natural condition of underground water to be unsaturated again. The hydro-geochemical action evolves from double control (water-rock interaction and evaporation-concentration) to water-rock interaction control.									8	1	0	0	2	0	9			0269-4042	1573-2983		WOS:000562998900001	32162139

In this work, heterostructured photocatalysts consisting of ultrathin graphitic carbon nitride (g-(C)3N(4)) nanolayers decorated with MoS2 (gC(3)N(4)/ MoS2) were prepared through a conventional hydrothermal method with N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as the solvent, which prohibited the morphology damage of g-C3N4 nanosheets under high temperature and pressure. The achieved nanosized few-layer MoS2 with abundant defect sites and disordered structures was uniformly grown on the g-C3N4 nanosheets. The structures and optical properties of g-C3N4/MoS2 heterostructures were carefully characterized. By optimizing the proportion of MoS2 decoration, the g-C3N4/MoS2 heterostructure with a MoS2 content of 2.5 wt% could exhibit the highest photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity under visible-light-irradiation (l $ 400 nm) of 732.0 mmol g(-1) h(-1), which was 58.6 fold more than that of undecorated g-C3N4 (12.5 mmol g(-1) h(-1)). Photoelectrochemical analysis and photoluminescence (PL) results demonstrated the existence of interfacial charge transfer in g-C3N4/ MoS2 heterostructures, which leads to efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Finally, electron transfer kinetics from g-C3N4 to MoS2 were systematically investigated, and g-C3N4/MoS2-2.5 wt% (CM-2.5) presented the fastest electron injection rate (2.2 x 10(-10) s(-1)) and highest efficiency (43.4%), which were responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic H-2 evolution.									17	1	0	0	1	0	17			2398-4902			WOS:000469258600009		
J	Qian, YZ; Wasserburg, GJ								Sources for metals in the intergalactic medium								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				623	1			17	22		10.1086/428644				APR 10 2005	2005	We present a discussion of possible sources of C, O, and Si in the intergalactic medium (IGM) using the yields of very massive stars (VMSs) and Type II supernovae (SNe II). The chemical evolution of the IGM is considered on the basis of analytical phenomenological models of hierarchical structure formation and the required metal production rates. Two regimes are considered: one for gas expulsion by VMSs and SNe II in low-mass halos prior to dissociation of H-2 molecules and reionization, and the other for later SN II - driven outflows from intermediate-mass halos. We use recent data on the abundances of C, O, and Si in the IGM inferred from two UV background (UVB) models. We show that the values of [C/O](IGM) and [Si/C](IGM) inferred from the UVB model using quasars only cannot be explained by any existing stellar models. To account for the elemental ratios in the IGM by stellar models requires that a softer UVB model be used in calculating the elemental abundances from the data on ionic species. This then permits a solution using the yields of VMSs and SNe II. The results, in particular [Si/C](IGM), show that VMSs must provide greater than or similar to 15% of the C in the IGM. The preferred scenario is that VMSs in low-mass halos provided between 15% and 60% of the C in the regime of very high redshift ( z greater than or similar to 15) and that galactic outflows provided the remainder during later epochs ( 4 < z less than or similar to 6). Thus, there is a large gap in z between metal production by VMSs very early in the chemical evolution of the IGM and subsequent contributions from galactic outflows. It is not possible to explain the observations by just SN II sources associated with galactic outflows. The observational estimate of [O/H](IGM) implies a high [Fe/H](IGM) >= - 3 for all cases considered ( including the case of a pure VMS source). This raises problems with regard to observations of metal-poor stars in the Galaxy. In addition, the [O/Fe] values for SN II models are in conflict with stellar observations, which indicate that the calculated average Fe yields of SNe II are a factor of similar to 2 too high. These issues and the general problem of relating abundances in the IGM to those in metal-poor stars remain to be investigated.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000228197700003

In this study, we demonstrated the first synthesis of uniform Fe and Mo co-doped BiVO4 (Fe/Mo-BVO) porous nanoshuttles (PNSs) through a simple solvothermal method combined with a subsequent impregnation thermal treatment. It has been discovered that the incorporation of Fe and Mo into the BVO lattice not only influences the shuttle-like morphology and porous structure but also modifies the band structure of the pristine BVO; this consequently boosts the photocatalytic performance of BVO. The as-prepared Fe/Mo-BVO PNSs exhibit significantly enhanced photoactivity for water oxidation under visible-light irradiation, and an average O-2 evolution rate of up to 191.5 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) is obtained, which is nearly 1.5 and 17 times higher than the rates obtained for Mo-doped BVO and pristine BVO, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also employed to further investigate the electronic structure of the co-doped products.									44	0	0	0	2	0	44			2052-1553			WOS:000417060300012

The identity of aqueously altered material strongly depends on lithospheric cycling of abundant and water-soluble elements such as Si and O. However, direct constraints that define the character of Hadean sedimentary material are absent because samples from this earliest eon are limited to detrital zircons (ZrSiO4). Here we show that concurrent measurements of Si and O isotope ratios in Phanerozoic and detrital pre-3.0 Ga zircon constrain the composition of aqueously altered precursors incorporated into their source melts. Phanerozoic zircon from (S)edimentary-type rocks contain heterogeneous delta O-18 and delta Si-30 values consistent with assimilation of metapelitic material, distinct from the isotopic character of zircon from (I) gneous- and (A)norogenic-type rocks. The delta O-18 values of detrital Archean zircons are heterogeneous, although yield Si isotope compositions like mantle-derived zircon. Hadean crystals yield elevated delta O-18 values (vs. mantle zircon) and delta Si-30 values span almost the entire range observed for Phanerozoic samples. Coupled Si and O isotope data represent a constraint on Hadean weathering and sedimentary input into felsic melts including remelting of amphibolites possibly of basaltic origin, and fractional addition of chemical sediments, such as cherts and/or banded iron formations (BIFs) into source melts. That such sedimentary deposits were extensive enough to change the chemical signature of intracrustal melts suggests they may have been a suitable niche for (pre)biotic chemistry as early as 4.1 Ga.									35	5	0	0	3	0	37			0027-8424			WOS:000446764200047	30249648

The charge transfer at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface is of great importance, especially for the complex water oxidation reaction. In this study, we explored the feasibility of improving charge transfer efficiency at the interface of semiconductor/electrolyte by in situ growth of Co based Metal-Organic Frame work (Co-MOF) through a facile ion-exchanging method. Under optimized conditions, the Co-MOF nanosheet-modified hematite gave a photocurrent density of 2.0 mA cm(-2) (200% improvement) at 1.23 V-RHE with a cathodic shift of 180 mV in the photocurrent onset potential, in comparison to bare alpha-Fe2O3 (0.71 mA cm(-2)@1.23 VRHE). To elucidate the role of Co-MOF, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Mott-Schottky measurements were carried out. It was found that the atomically distributed Co2+ in Co-MOF possessed excellent hole storage capability and charge transfer efficiency, as evidenced by the high surface capacitance and extremely low surface charge transfer resistance.									30	2	0	0	2	0	30			0038-092X	1471-1257		WOS:000447113000041

To achieve this goal, the design of oriented heterojunctions for efficient carrier transport and separation is a new strategy based on their conductive anisotropy. Herein, a novel oriented J-J type ZnmIn2Sm+3@In2S3 heterojunction photocatalyst with hierarchical structures is fabricated with the assistance of oxalic acid. The hierarchical structures consist of flower-like hollow ZnmIn2Sm+3 microspheres with epitaxially grown quantum confined In2S3 along the petal rims (J-J type heterojunction). This heterojunction improves the transport and separation of the photoexcited carriers, and extends the visible-light response range. Thus, the heterojunction photocatalyst exhibits significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity with a hydrogen evolution rate of 330 mu mol h(-1), which is about 4 times higher than that of single ZnIn2S4. The findings provide new insights to construct efficient oriented heterojunctions for anisotropic semiconductors.									87	4	0	0	8	0	88			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000457952600062

Here, we demonstrate that the sequential introduction of vapor-phase phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) and methylammonium (MAI) into methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) thin films, which is obtained from PbI2, suppresses their degradation and enhances the ambient stability. Compared with the simultaneous PEAI introduction during the conversion of PbI2 to MAPbI(3), the MAPbI(3) films with sequential treatment exhibited higher PEAI surface coverage, which imparts superior resistance to degradation. Combined analyses of the exposure-time-dependent crystal structure evolution, photoemission profiles, and photocurrent generation characteristics of the films reveal that conformal PEAI passivation suppresses the volatile release of methylammonium (MA) species and the inclusion of O-2/H2O molecules. This study highlights the importance of developing a vapor-phase passivation strategy for innate polycrystalline perovskite thin films and their optoelectronic applications with long-term stability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000790217400003

The regulatory mechanism underlying WS conditions at an early stage in maize seedlings is largely unknown. In the present study, the primary root tips of B73 seedlings were sampled before (0 h) and after (2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 10 h, and 12 h) WS and then subjected to transcriptome sequencing, resulting in the identification of differentially expressed protein-coding genes (DEpcGs) and long non-coding RNAs (DElncRs) in response to WS. These DEpcGs were classified into nine clusters, which were significantly enriched in several metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis and methionine metabolism. Several transcription factor families, including AP2-EREBP, bZIP, NAC, bHLH, and MYB, were also significantly enriched. In total, 6099 lncRNAs were identified, of which 3190 were DElncRs. A co-expression analysis revealed lncRNAs to be involved in 11 transcription modules, 10 of which were significantly associated with WS. The DEpcGs in the four modules were enriched in the hypoxia response pathways, including phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, MAPK signaling, and carotenoid biosynthesis, in which 137 DElncRs were also co-expressed. Most of the co-expressed DElncRs were co-localized with previously identified quantitative trait loci associated with waterlogging tolerance. A quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of DEpcG and DElncR expression among the 32 maize genotypes after 4 h of WS verified significant expression correlations between them as well as significant correlation with the phenotype of waterlogging tolerance. Moreover, the high proportion of hypoxia response elements in the promoter region increased the reliability of the DElncRs identified in this study. These results provide a comprehensive transcriptome in response to WS at an early stage of maize seedlings and expand our understanding of the regulatory network involved in hypoxia in plants.									15	0	0	0	11	0	15				2073-4425		WOS:000529189000031	32121334

Controlled loading of MnS2 on porous TiO2 nanosheets for enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS				33	9			6646	6656		10.1007/s10854-022-07839-0		FEB 2022		MAR 2022	2022	In this report, spherical nanoparticles/2D nanosheets based MnS2/TiO2 nanocomposites were prepared in different weight compositions which were further employed to investigate photocatalytic degradation of hydrogen production under solar light irradiation. MnS2/TiO2 nanocomposites were prepared by in situ addition of exfoliated MnS2 (nanoparticles) in different weight ratios of 5, 10 and 15% in TiO2 sol. Surface morphology, phase analysis, optical, textural properties and elemental composition were studied using Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Transmission electron microspore (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Vis spectroscopy, Photoluminescence spectroscopy, N-2 adsorption-desorption analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) analysis. When the MnS2 loading was 15.0%, the MnS2/TiO2 photocatalyst reached the maximum rate for photocatalytic H-2 evolution at 3150.7 mu mol/h/g, which was 4.5 times higher than that of TiO2 (711.81 mu mol/h/g). It is believed that the boosting photocatalytic performance of heterostructure could be ascribed to the synergetic effect between the MnS2 and TiO2, which accelerated the separation and migration efficiency of charge carries as well as enhanced the light-harvest efficiency.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000749966400001

Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as a promising alternative, to improve its PMS activation performance, we proposed an efficient method to prepare exfoliated Se doped g-C3N4 (Se-g-C3N4) with 0.095 wt% Se and more exposed reactive N vacancies through the thermal polycondensation of melamine and Se powder at 550 ?. The results proved that 93.0% of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) can be degraded over Se-g-C3N4 with PMS in 180 min, and the corresponding degradation rate constant of 0.0149 min? 1 was even 4-fold higher than that of bulk g-C3N4 (0.0039 min-1). It was found that more 1O2 was generated and ?OH was further identified because of the enhanced PMS selfdecomposition process, especially PMS reduction via electron transfer from Se-g-C3N4. The introduction of Se atom in g-C3N4 structure not only induced the formation of nitrogen vacancies to modulate the electron distribution of g-C3N4, but also favored the exfoliation of inter-facial stacking to increase the exposure of active sites due to the large atomic radius of Se. Hence, this work offered a new strategy for improving the PMS activation performance of g-C3N4 by regulating its electron deficiency and exposing more reactive N vacancies simultaneously.									9	1	0	0	3	0	10			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000641398700005

Single-crystal ZnO columns grow in the [0001] direction through repeated nucleation and growth of epitaxial hexagonal pyramids on the c-planes. Homoepitaxial nucleation of three-dimensional ZnO pyramids is most likely due to the Ehrlich-Schwoebel effect. This mechanism produces columns that are a few hundred nanometers in diameter and up to 2 mum in length. Convergent beam electron diffraction shows that the columns grow with Zn polarity in the [0001] direction.

A reduction in bandgap (2.82 eV), as estimated from diffuse reflectance spectra, is explained using Valence band XPS studies and attributed to the upshift in valence band maximum. Photocatalytic activity of the samples has been demonstrated by organic dye degradation, where 92% decay was observed in 180 min under direct sunlight. Photoelectrochemical studies under visible light showed significant photoresponse with a photocurrent density of similar to 8 mu A/cm(2). This study, as per our knowledge, is first of its kind where ZnO:InN oxynitride has been explored as a UV-visible light active photocatalyst with significant H-2 generation of similar to 48 mu mol/g by UV-visible light water splitting using methanol scavenger. The results show the promising future applications of ZnO:InN oxynitride as a sunlight active photocatalyst for hydrogen production.

Among them, MXene has become the focus of current research as a new, effective and inexpensive promoter-free catalyst. Herein, a novel 1D/2D photocatalyst of TiO2/Ti3C2 is successfully prepared by electrostatic self-assembly technique. The maximum H-2 production rate of TiO2/Ti3C2 nanocomposites is up to 6.979 mmol h(-1) g(-1), which is 3.8 times that of pure TiO2 nanofibers (NFs). This improvement in photocatalytic H-2 production of TiO2/Ti3C2 is originated from the heterogenous interface between TiO2 NFs and Ti3C2 nanosheets. It brings higher photocatalytic efficiency and maintains its cycle H-2 production capacity. There is almost no decrease in photocatalytic H-2 production efficiency after 5 cycles. It is believed that this study can offer an innovative pathway to design high performance and low-cost photocatalytic materials composed of MXene co-catalyst for efficient water splitting H-2 production over semiconductors.									75	12	0	0	6	0	78			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000488957400100

However, deposition of the discharge product, insulating Li2O2, is known to seriously limit the electrochemical performance of Li-O-2 batteries. While extensive studies have focused on relieving electrode deactivation by controlling Li2O2 growth, no permanent or effective mechanism is delivered. Here, a unique design comprising a catalytic cathode constructed by cracked carbon submicron tube (CST) arrays decorated with Au nanoparticles on inner walls is proposed. The introduction of Au nanoparticles not only improves electrode conductivity but also provides catalytic sites, guiding conformal growth of thin-layered Li2O2 inside the cracked CST. Density functional theory calculations support that Au decoration on CST favors the conformal growth of Li2O2 on inner tubular walls. This growth behavior of Li2O2 renders easy decomposition of Li2O2, prevents carbon tube electrode from full, rapid deactivation, and preserves the free space for reactants transport. Li-O-2 cells with Au@CST exhibit good rate capability (1208 mAh g(-1) at a high current density of 1000 mA g(-1)) and long cycle life (112 cycles at a current density of 400 mA g(-1) with a limited capacity of 500 mAh g(-1)).									42	2	0	0	5	0	42			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000388166700020

This composite catalyst was also used as a photoanode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen production. The hydrogen production rate reached 168.6 mu mol cm(-2)h(-1) (37.77 L m(-2) h(-1)) under the simulated solar light, which is 2.7 times that of CdS and the same as that of CdS-Pt. In addition, in the Na2S-Na2SO3 system for PEC hydrogen production, an abnormal relationship between photocurrent and the hydrogen production yield was found. By designing a series of experiments, the photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical characteristics for hydrogen production were reasonably revealed for the first time. In this work, the prepared structured catalyst is easy to be recycled, and CoSx can replace precious metal Pt, showing a promising application. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Heterogeneous reactions between solid and aqueous (or gaseous) species are found to produce anomalous fractionations of sulfur isotopes when the adsorption energy is small (<0.3 eV; 30 kJ/mol) and a discontinuity occurs in the number of bound energy levels of different sulfur isotopes. We refer to "anomalous sulfur isotope fractionation" when the Delta S-33 and (33)theta' (approximate to delta S-33/delta S-34) values of a sample fall outside of 0 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand and 0.51 +/- 0.01 parts per thousand, respectively, and/or when the Delta S-36 and (33)theta' (approximate to delta S-36/delta S-34) values of a sample fall outside of 0 +/- 0.4 parts per thousand and 1.9 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand, respectively. The magnitude of anomalous sulfur isotope effects during a heterogeneous reaction increases with increasing temperature. Depending on the values of chernisorption energy and bond strength, the delta S-33, delta S-34, delta S-36, Delta S-33 and Delta S-36 values of chernisorption products may be as variable as those observed in Archean sedimentary rocks.Ab initio calculations for SO2 adsorption on a kerogen surface indicate the possibility of creating anomalous isotope signatures for the adsorbed species, such as: delta S-33/delta S-34 approximate to 1.08, delta S-36/delta S-34 approximate to 0.84, Delta S-33 = 7.0 to 13.parts per thousand, and Delta S-36= -13.0 to -25.2 parts per thousand in a temperature range of 0 to 200 degrees C) the magnitude of Delta S-33 and Delta S-36 increase with increasing temperature. These data, together with various geochemical data (e.g., organic C and sulfide S contents; hydrothermal alteration effects) on Archean sedimentary rocks with anomalous sulfur isotope fractionations, suggest that the anomalous sulfur isotope signatures in such rocks may have been created by heterogeneous reactions between organic matter (+ minerals) and sulfur-bearing aqueous solutions under hydrothermal conditions, rather than by UV photolysis of volcanic SO2 in an O-2-poor atmosphere.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is crucial to this process in pregnant mammals and potentially pregnant squamates (lizards and snakes), as we investigate here. VEGF(111), an unusual and potent angiogenic splice variant of VEGF, increases its expression during pregnancy in the uterus of a viviparous lizard, in parallel with similar increases in uterine angiogenesis during gestation. However, we also find that VEGF(111) is expressed in oviparous skinks, and is not ubiquitous among viviparous skinks. Thus, different mechanisms of uterine angiogenesis during pregnancy may evolve concurrent with viviparity in different lizard lineages. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev. Evol.) 324B: 152-158, 2015.

J	SHANKAR, A; ARNETT, D								THERMONUCLEAR RUNAWAYS IN NOVA OUTBURSTS .2. EFFECT OF STRONG, INSTANTANEOUS, LOCAL FLUCTUATIONS								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				433	1			216	228		10.1086/174637				SEP 20 1994	1994	In an attempt to understand the manner in which nova outbursts are initiated on the surface of a white dwarf, we investigate the effects fluctuations have on the evolution of a thermonuclear runaway. Fluctuations in temperature, density, or the composition of material in the burning shell may arise due to the chaotic flow field generated by convection when it occurs, or by the accretion process itself. With the aid of two-dimensional reactive flow calculations, we consider cases where a strong fluctuation in temperature arises during the early, quiescent accretion phase or during the later, more dynamic, explosion phase. In all cases we find that an instantaneous, local temperature fluctuation causes the affected material to become Rayleigh-Taylor unstable. The rapid rise and subsequent expansion of matter immediately cools the hot blob. which prevents the lateral propagation of burning. This suggests that local temperature fluctuations do not play a significant role in directly initiating the runaway, especially during the early stages. However, they may provide an efficient mechanism of mixing core material into the envelope (thereby pre-enriching the fuel for subsequent episodes of explosive hydrogen burning) and of mixing substantial amounts of the radioactive nucleus N-13 into the surface layers, making novae potential gamma-ray sources. This suggests that it is the global, not the local, evolution of the core-envelope interface to high temperatures which dominates the development of the runaway. We also present a possible new scenario for the initiation of nova outbursts based on our results.									33	0	0	0	0	0	33			0004-637X			WOS:A1994PG63900018

High temperature tribology in Ar jet and adhesion behavior of the oxidized coating were addressed. The use of Ar protects the coating from the oxidation reactions and allowed to shed light into the details and paths of the nitride oxidation process. The c-Al0.66Ti0.33N nitrides were slightly oxidized in Ar even at high temperature (700 to 900 degrees C). The surface chemistry evaluation shows very thin Al- and Ti-based oxide layers formation after treatment at 700 degrees C in Ar. However, the onset formation of the rutile TiO2 oxide was detected only after treatment at 900 degrees C and was clearly found by low-angle XRD diffraction after 1000 degrees C. The XPS surface analysis of the oxidized samples at 800 degrees C indicated the formation of extremely thin layers mainly composed of mixed oxides (alpha-Al2O3 gamma-Al2O3 and rutile TiO2). The gradual changes in the chemical composition of the oxidized coatings observed at 900 degrees C clearly demonstrate the formation of gradient boundaries between Al-rich and Ti-rich oxy-nitride layers. After exposure at 1000 degrees C at least four oxides and oxi-nitrides layers and interlayers were found. Additionally, it is suspected that the transition oxide phases such as c-TiO, c-Al0.54Ti2.46O0.28N4.58, alpha-Al2TiO5 and TiOxNy might be precursors leading to the formation of thermodynamically stable rutile and alumina phases. Surface inspection after high temperature tribology in Ar jet showed formation of tensile cracks in the wear tracks and wear processes due to high size particle adhesion-abrasion and low size particle micro-ploughing of hard nitrides, oxi-nitrides and brittle oxide particles. Adhesion tests performed after high temperature tribology in Ar showed critical load decrease related to cohesive and adhesive damages at the contact point of the scratch track.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0257-8972			WOS:000461526400006

Using a novel insole technique that restricted compression of the foot's longitudinal arch, this study provides the first direct evidence that arch compression/recoil during locomotion contributes to lowering energy cost. Restricting arch compression near maximally (similar to 80%) during moderate-speed (2.7 ms(-1)) level running increased metabolic cost by + 6.0% (p < 0.001, d = 0.67; unaffected by foot strike technique). A simple model shows that the metabolic energy saved by the arch is largely explained by the passive-elastic work it supplies that would otherwise be done by active muscle. Both experimental and model data confirm that it is the end-range of arch compression that dictates the energy-saving role of the arch. Restricting arch compression had no effect on the cost of walking or incline running (3 degrees), commensurate with the smaller role of passive-elastic mechanics in these gaits. These findings substantiate the elastic energy-saving role of the longitudinal arch during running, and suggest that arch supports used in some footwear and orthotics may increase the cost of running.									71	1	0	0	49	1	72			2045-2322			WOS:000368335500001	26783259

However, only during the past decade has the scientific community become aware that "biological stoichiometry" may also help bridge evolutionary biology and ecosystem ecology. This awareness led to increasing attention to biological process stoichiometry in ecology during the past decade. Despite this trend in ecological data analysis and interpretation, ecological models are still predominantly formulated without sufficient attention to process stoichiometry. To support scientists in formulating stoichiometry in process models based on elemental mass conservation, we transfer techniques from chemical process engineering to achieve the following objectives: (i) develop a generic mathematical framework to formulate and solve stoichiometric equations; (ii) facilitate the extension of currently used process stoichiometries to consider more elements (e.g. adding S and/or Si to C, H, O, N and P); (iii) identify the need for stoichiometric constraints of biogeochemical processes in addition to elemental mass balances; (iv) unify approaches to characterize organic matter by elemental mass fractions, organic carbon, or chemical oxygen demand: (v) provide a small package of functions for the statistics and graphics software R (http://www.r-project.org) to support environmental model building, and (vi) show how to incorporate automatic stoichiometric calculations into next generation environmental simulation software.

By defining temperature and time limits, we produce TiO2 hollow microspheres with a fluoride-mediated self-transformation. The surface morphology of TiO2 hollow microspheres was studied by SEM. The hollow microspheres have diameters of about 800 nm and are remarkably uniform. The UV-light photocatalytic activity and the stability/multifunction of TiO2 hollow microspheres structure were evaluated by photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The excellent photocatalytic activity is attributed to large specific surface area, more active sites, unique hollow structures, and improved light scattering. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Then inhibitory effects of matched flame retardants were discussed and microscopic morphology of combustion residues were observed. The results indicate that the decomposition process of each SARA fraction still includes two thermal mass loss stages after adding the matched flame retardants. However, the thermal decomposition rates are lowered, and the initial decomposition temperatures and maximum decomposition temperatures of each SARA fraction are elevated. Also, the matched flame retardants have few effects on the volatile constituents of four SARA fractions, but show an obvious influence on the release amount of gaseous products. CO2 and H2O are still the two main products of each SARA fraction after adding matched flame retardants. Few chemical reactions between SARA fractions and flame retardants are found during their decomposition. Additionally, the superposed and densified charring layers are formed due to the synergic effects of the composite flame retardants. The thick charring layer prevents the heat from transferring, and hinders the oxygen supply, and inhibits the release of flammable volatiles. Finally, the thermal stability of each SARA fraction is greatly improved by the matched flame retardants. The composite flame retardants show a synergistic flame retarding and smoke suppressing effects. This study is beneficial to develop new composite flame retardants for asphalt binder with a satisfactory flaming retarding and smoke suppressing effects. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

J	ROMERO, L; NERETNIEKS, I; MORENO, L								MOVEMENT OF THE REDOX FRONT AT THE OSAMU UTSUMI URANIUM-MINE, POCOS-DE-CALDAS, BRAZIL								JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION				45	1-3			471	502		10.1016/0375-6742(92)90136-V				NOV 1992	1992	In the open pit uranium mine at Pocos de Caldas the uranium oxide ore has accumulated at a redox front. The redox front forms and moves by the oxidation of pyrite in the rock by oxygen dissolved in the infiltrating rainwater. The phonolitic host-rock was formed about 90 million years ago. It is possible that between 3 and 12 km of rock has been eroded since then. The redox front lies between tens and several hundred meters below the ground surface. The front is very irregular and locally there are oxidation ''fingers'' which extend well ahead of the main front. The redox fingers are often associated with fractures or fracture zones.An attempt has been made to model the formation and evolution of the redox front at Pocos de Caldas by applying chemical transport models of different complexity. One class of models used is based on advective flow in a porous medium; the continuum models. Another class of models used is based on fracture flow with transport of oxygen into the rock matrix by molecular diffusion. In the latter class of models, channels with different flowrates are modelled and the flowrate is allowed to vary over time stochastically to account for the changing properties of the hydraulic network.The erosion of the surface is as fast as the redox front movement which stabilizes at a distance below the ground surface because the water flux decreases with depth. Another possible cause for stabilization of the tips of the redox fingers is that the flow channels form a network with variable flow properties. The main chemical reactions, i.e. pyrite oxidation, clay formation and the accumulation of uranium oxide at the redox front, are well in accordance with expectations and with what a chemical transport model predicts. The formation of redox fingers may partly be caused by variable hydraulic conductivity of the rock and partly by the presence of highly conductive fractures and channels in fractures.Several mechanisms contribute to the formation of the complex shape of the redox front. Some of the processes have been conceptualized and some have been quantified in the form of mathematical models which were used to make quantitative calculations. The calculations have given considerable support to the determination of which mechanisms may be important.The overall oxidized zone can be explained by advective transport in a porous medium. The fingered zone around fractures would be explained by flow through fractures (channelling) and indicates that matrix diffusion is clearly present as a mechanism to access the interior of the rock.									7	0	0	0	3	0	7			0375-6742			WOS:A1992KF54400019		
J	Rossignol, O.; Dodson, J. J.; Marquilly, C.; Guderley, H.								Do Local Adaptation and the Reproductive Tactic of Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar L.) Affect Offspring Metabolic Capacities?								PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY				83	3			424	434		10.1086/649561				MAY-JUN 2010	2010	Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) is an iteroparous, anadromous species that exhibits some of the greatest within-population variability in size and age at maturity of all vertebrates. In the conditional reproductive strategy of salmonids, the male reproductive tactic expressed is believed to depend on an individual male's status relative to others in the population and therefore depends on his capacity to attain a physiological threshold, the exact nature of which is unknown. Although the threshold is influenced by local biotic and abiotic conditions, it is likely to be under genetic control. Our study examined whether the early growth, muscle metabolic capacities, routine metabolic rate, and spontaneous swimming of salmon alevins reared in laboratory conditions varied with the population of origin, maternal investment, and the paternal reproductive tactic. Our experimental design allowed us to establish that neither the population of origin nor the paternal reproductive tactic influenced the physiological capacities of alevins. The strong influence of the mother on alevin metabolic capacities suggests that the bioenergetic differences in metabolic capacities, realized metabolic rates, and activity levels that could eventually dictate the reproductive tactic of male offspring may originate in maternal effects.									7	0	0	0	7	0	7			1522-2152	1537-5293		WOS:000276664400004	20350165

However, the mechanism underlying B. ovis infection remains unclear. In the present study, we used prokaryotic transcriptome sequencing to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between wild-type B. ovis and intracellular B. ovis in RAW264.7 macrophages. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were performed, and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to validate the top 10 upregulated and downregulated DEGs. The results showed that 212 genes were differentially expressed, including 68 upregulated and 144 downregulated genes, which were mainly enriched in 30 GO terms linked to biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. KEGG analysis showed that the DEGs were enriched in the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, beta-alanine metabolism, and quorum sensing pathway. BME_RS01160, BME_RS04270, BME_RS08185, BME_RS12880, BME_RS25875, predicted_RNA865, and predicted_RNA953 were confirmed with the transcriptome sequencing data. Hence, our findings not only reveal the intracellular parasitism of B. ovis in the macrophage immune system, but also help to understand the mechanism of chronic B. ovis infection.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0360-3997	1573-2576		WOS:000534202000001	32430895

X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope, Raman spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated the generation of the 1T@2H-MoS2 and black TiO2. The efficiency of the 1T@2H-MoS2/B-TiO2 core-shell structure degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) reached 98.0%. The high photocatalytic activity was due to the presence of 1T-MoS2, which accelerated the electron transfer to participate in the redox reaction. In addition, the presence of B-TiO2 suppressed the undesirable electron-hole recombination. Finally, the synergistic effect between 1T@2HMoS(2) and B-TiO2 promoted the separation of the photoelectron-hole pairs. Moreover, scavenger studies found that the hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) was the dominant reactive oxygen species in the degradation of RhB under visible light irradiation. The possible growth mechanism and photocatalytic mechanism are discussed in detail. The results of this study will contribute to the improvement in the visible light absorption and photocatalytic degradation of catalysts.									31	1	0	0	2	0	31			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000431406400034

Herein, a strategy of complex ions substitution is proposed to achieve the goal. The (1-x) (0.75Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3-0.25SrTiO3)-xLa(Mg2/3Ta1/3)O3 (NBST-xLMT) ceramics were fabricated through a solidstate reaction method. A significantly enhanced breakdown electric field (Eb) of 246.03 kV/cm is obtained in NBST-0.06LMT ceramics due to the refined average grain size (AGS), the enhanced band gap width and the inhibited oxygen vacancies by LMT doping. Furthermore, a high Wrec of 3.18 J/cm3and large eta of 86% are concurrently achieved in NBST-0.06LMT ceramics under a relatively low electric field of 246 kV/cm. Meanwhile, the variations of (Wrec, eta) under 170 kV/cm are less than 10% from 30 degrees C to 200 degrees C, indicating an excellent thermal stability. Besides, the ceramics show a fast discharge rate of 155 ns by a charge-discharge measuring. In general, our results demonstrate the strategy of complex ions substitution is an effective way to achieve high energy storage performance under a relatively low electric field in NBT-based ceramics.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0925-8388	1873-4669		WOS:000806575600003

S. coastal waters. Fish mortality was attributable to gill damage with exposure to reactive oxygen species (peroxide, superoxide, and hydroxide radicals), neurotoxins, physical clogging, and hemolytic substances. Morphological identification of these organisms in environmental water samples is difficult, particularly when fixatives are used. Because of this difficulty and the continued global emergence of these species in coastal estuarine waters, we initiated the development and validation of a suite of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Sequencing was used to generate complete data sets for nuclear encoded small-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA; 18S); internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2, 5.8S; and plastid encoded SSU rRNA (16S) for confirmed raphidophyte cultures from various geographic locations. Sequences for several Chattonella species (C. antiqua, C. marina, C. ovata, C. subsalsa, and C. verruculosa), Heterosigma akashiwo, and Fibrocapsa japonica were generated and used to design rapid and specific PCR assays for several species including C. verruculosa Hara et Chihara, C. subsalsa Biecheler, the complex comprised of C. marina Hara et Chihara, C. antiqua Ono and C. ovata, H. akashiwo Ono, and F. japonica Toriumi et Takano using appropriate loci. With this comprehensive data set, we were also able to perform phylogenetic analyses to determine the relationship between these species.									78	2	0	0	69	2	79			0022-3646	1529-8817		WOS:000242835000017	20411032

It allows us to understand our experimental observations which include the influence of T(s) on the anisotropy and the fact that the lateral (spontaneous) etch rate of W as a function of 1/T(s) does not follow an Arrhenius law. The model is valid as long as the pressure is sufficiently low (less than or equal to 0.5 mTorr) to neglect the influence of coadsorption and passivation effects, likely related to oxygen contamination of the gas phase coming from the fused silica discharge tube interacting with fluorine atoms. Consistency of the model is well demonstrated by observing that the lateral to vertical etch rate ratio as a function of 1/T(s), under different plasma conditions, leads to a unique value of the activation energy (R = 0.65 eV) for the associative desorption of WF(6), the volatile reaction product of tungsten with fluorine adatoms.

Apparent rates of O-2 activation depend both on the intrinsic kinetics of distinct Cu site types and the distributions of such sites within a given zeolite, which depend on the density and arrangement of the framework Al atoms. Here, we use hydrothermal synthesis methods to control the arrangement of framework Al sites in chabazite (CHA) zeolites and, in turn, the distinct Cu site types formed. Time-resolved in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals the kinetics of O-2 adsorption and activation within these well-defined Cu-CHA materials and the concomitant structural evolution of copper-oxygen (CuxOy) complexes, which are interpreted alongside Cu(I) oxidation kinetics extracted from in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Raman spectra of several plausible CuxOy species simulated using density functional theory suggest that experimental spectra (lambda(ex) = 532 nm) capture the formation of mono(mu-oxo)dicopper species (ZCuOCuZ). Transient experiments show that the timescales required to form CuxOy structures that no longer change in Raman spectra correspond to the durations of oxidative treatments that maximize CH3OH yields in stoichiometric PMO cycles (approximately 2 h). Yet, these periods extend well beyond the timescales for the complete conversion of the initial Cu(I) intermediates to their Cu(II) states (<0.3 h, reflected in X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy spectra), which demonstrates that CuxOy complexes continue to evolve structurally following rapid Cu(I) oxidation. The dependence of ZCuOCuZ formation rates on O-2 pressure, H2O pressure, and temperature is consistent with a mechanism in which ZCuOH reduces to form ZCu(+) sites that bind molecular oxygen and form ZCu-O-2 intermediates. Subsequent reaction with proximate ZCu(+) forms bridging peroxo dicopper complexes that cleave O-O bonds to form ZCuOCuZ in steps facilitated by water. These data and interpretations provide evidence for the chemical processes that link rapid and kinetically irrelevant Cu oxidation steps (frequently probed by XAS and UV-vis spectroscopy) to the relatively slow genesis of reactive Cu complexes that form CH3OH during PMO. In doing so, we reveal previously unrecognized complexities in the processes by which Cu ions in zeolites activate O-2 to form active Cu(x)O(y)complexes, which underscore the insight afforded by judicious combinations of experimental and theoretical techniques.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000704700800007

Morphology design and coupling with graphene are effective methods to enhance its photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, a novel hydrothermal method was developed for the fabrication of BiVO4 nanoplates with exposed {010} facets onto reduced graphene oxide sheets (RGO). During the process, ethanolamine used acts as a pH regulator to intrigue the exposure of {010} planes of BiVO4 as well as a crosslinking agent. As a result an aerogel-like structure of the composite was obtained. When used as a photocatalyst, the resultant composite showed an enhanced performance in both the O-2 evolution from water and the oxidation of phenol in comparison with pure BiVO4. This enhanced performance may be explained in terms of the synergetic effects of the unique nanoplate BiVO4 with exposed {010} planes, the improved electronic conductivity due to the addition of graphene, and more importantly, the interface interaction between the BiVO4 and RGO which reduces the recombination loss of photo-generated charges effectively.

Greece								THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE GEOLOGY OF THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN, PROCEEDINGS								211	220						2000	2000	Geological, microthermometric, mineralogical and isotopic investigations of the Palia Kavala gold-base metal orefield, western Rhodope massif, Northeastern Greece are presented here. The Palia Kavala orefield is structurally restricted to NE-and NW-trending shear zones between schistose rocks (gneisses, amphibolites) and marbles of the Pangeon Unit. These rocks underwent upper greenschist facies metamorphism (4-6 kbar, 520(580 C), during Late Cretaceous to Eocene times, and were subsequently uplifted and retrograded by greenschist facies metamorphism of Miocene age. At the same time, the metamorphic rocks were intruded by granitoids. The ore mineralization is of vein and replacement type and includes arsenopyrite, pyrite, electrum, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, galena, quartz and calcite. Extensive gossaniferous zones have developed on most of the mineralized sites. Fluid inclusion data in quartz and calcite suggest T-h values of 280-320 degreesC, low salinities (up to 13 wt% equiv. NaCl), and highly fluctuating fluid and vapour (CO2) pressures of 3 to 3.5 kbar suggesting a depth of 1 to 3 Km for the mineral deposition. Arsenopyrite composition denotes high S fugacity in the fluids and a temperature range (Tsimilar to290-340degreesC) conforming well with the fluid inclusion data. Oxygen isotope results (delta(18)Osimilar to +16.22 to +19.12 per mil SMOW), suggest a mainly metamorphic source of oxygen in ore fluids. Carbon (delta(13)C similar to -9.2 to +3.4 per mil PDB) and S (delta(34)S similar to -0.2 to 1.0 per mil CDT) isotopic values mark a moderate temperature of fluids and a magmatic source. The above data suggest the following chronological succession of events for the Palia Kavala ore formation. During prograde metamorphism, decarbonatization and devolatilization reactions in the country rocks released large volumes of CO2- and H2O-rich fluid which infiltrated to higher crustal levels and was trapped in fault zones. During the Miocene uplift of the area, this fluid mixed with magmatic solutions originating from the Kavala granodiorite intrusion which also acted as a heat source. The mixed C02-rich fluids leached gold and base metals from the country rocks and percolated through active shear zones. Gold and base metal deposition probably took place through pressure decrease, loss of dissolved CO2 and H2S in solution, unmixing of the parent fluid into CO2-rich and CO2-poor solutions and consequent destabilization of the dissolved metal complexes.					3rd International Conference on the Geology of the Eastern Mediterranean3rd International Conference on the Geology of the Eastern Mediterranean	SEP 23-26, 1998SEP 23-26, 1998	Geol Survey Dept CyprusGeol Survey Dept Cyprus	NICOSIA, CYPRUSNICOSIA, CYPRUS	4	0	0	0	1	0	4					9963-1-7506-6	WOS:000176423000015		
J	DEMARSAC, NT; HOUMARD, J								ADAPTATION OF CYANOBACTERIA TO ENVIRONMENTAL STIMULI - NEW STEPS TOWARDS MOLECULAR MECHANISMS								FEMS MICROBIOLOGY LETTERS				104	1-2			119	189						JAN 1993	1993	Dating from the Pre-Cambrian era, cyanobacteria have a long history of adaptation to the Earth's environment. By evolving oxygen via photosynthetic reactions similar to those of plants and green algae, these prokaryotes were essential to the evolution of the present biosphere. They continue to make a large contribution to the equilibrium of the Earth's atmosphere by producing oxygen and removing carbon dioxide. To survive in extreme or variable environments, cyanobacteria have developed specific regulatory systems, in addition to more general mechanisms equivalent to those of other prokaryotes or photosynthetic eukaryotes. Specific regulatory systems control the differentiation of specialized nitrogen-fixing cells and of cell types facilitating the dispersion of species. In the past decade, considerable progress has been made towards understanding the expression of the cyanobacterial genome in response to variations in the intensity and spectral quality of incident light and in response to nutritional conditions, especially carbon, nitrogen and sulphur sources. These studies have provided insights into the relationships between carbon and nitrogen intermediary metabolism, and a start towards understanding of the interconnected pathways which lead from the perception of environmental signals to the regulation of enzyme activities and gene expression. Cyanobacterial regulatory mechanisms share common features with those of other prokaryotes, but are unique since these essentially photoautotrophic organisms must maintain a proper cellular C/N balance, in spite of daily variations in incident light. Thus an appropriate coordination between photosynthesis and other metabolic processes must be achieved through control of the catalytic activity of key enzymes by reducing equivalents and ATP produced by photosynthetic or respiratory electron transport. Recently discovered kinases/phosphatases act by post-translational modification of specific proteins which probably act as signal transducers or modulators of gene expression in a manner similar to the well-known two-component regulatory systems described in other bacteria. In this overview, we present our current knowledge on the molecular aspects of the biology of cyanobacteria, as well as on their mechanisms of resistance to metal ions and their responses to metabolic stress.									273	2	0	0	249	7	293			0378-1097	1574-6968		WOS:A1993KG66600005

SPD processing of oxides is first realized in 1930s, when Percy W. Bridgman introduce the principles of high-pressure torsion (HPT) method. Although the method is widely used nowadays to produce ultrafine-grained (UFG) metals, the application of method for SPD processing of oxides is quite limited. This article reviews some of the recent publications on the application of HPT method to oxide ceramics (Al2O3, ZrO2, TiO2, Y2O3, ZnO, and BaTiO3) and summarizes their major findings: powder compaction and partial consolidation, nanograin formation, formation of different kinds of lattice defects such as dislocations and oxygen vacancies, strain and grain size dependence of phase transformations, and improvement of functional properties such as bandgap narrowing, photoluminescence, photocatalytic activity, and dielectricity.									34	0	0	0	1	0	34			1438-1656	1527-2648		WOS:000457413600012		
J	Gao, DQ; Zhan, CG								Modeling evolution of hydrogen bonding and stabilization of transition states in the process of cocaine hydrolysis catalyzed by human butyrylcholinesterase								PROTEINS-STRUCTURE FUNCTION AND BIOINFORMATICS				62	1			99	110		10.1002/prot.20713				JAN 1 2006	2006	Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations were performed on the prereactive enzyme-substrate complex, transition states, intermediates, and product involved in the process of human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE)-catalyzed hydrolysis of (-)-cocaine. The computational results consistently reveal a unique role of the oxyanion hole (consisting of G116, G117, and A199) in BChE-catalyzed hydrolysis of cocaine, compared to acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-catalyzed hydrolysis of acetylcholine. During BChE-catalyzed hydrolysis of cocaine, only G117 has a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen (O31) of the cocaine benzoyl ester in the prereactive BChE-cocaine complex, and the NH groups of G117 and A199 are hydrogen-bonded with O31 of cocaine in all of the transition states and intermediates. Surprisingly, the NH hydrogen of G116 forms an unexpected hydrogen bond with the carboxyl group of E197 side chain and, therefore, is not available to form a hydrogen bond with O31 of cocaine in the acylation. The NH hydrogen of G116 is only partially available to form a weak hydrogen bond with O31 of cocaine in some structures involved in the deacylation. The change of the estimated hydrogen-bonding energy between the oxyanion hole and O31 of cocaine during the reaction process demonstrates how the protein environment can affect the energy barrier for each step of the BChE-catalyzed hydrolysis of cocaine. These insights concerning the effects of the oxyanion hole on the energy barriers provide valuable clues on how to rationally design BChE mutants with a higher catalytic activity for the hydrolysis of (-)-cocaine.									49	1	0	0	17	0	53			0887-3585	1097-0134		WOS:000234438600010	16288482

The 92 16S rDNA sequences analysed ranged across 50 different operational taxonomic units (OTU). The majority of these sequences were not closely related to known species. They belonged to 12 different groups, but essentially to the Cytophagales and the Proteobacteria beta, which represented 38% and 17% of the retrieved sequences respectively. No OTU numerically outnumbered the others. However. similarities were observed with previous reports on molecular characterisation of phosphorus-accumulating ecosystems, suggesting an enrichment in microorganisms belonging to the Rhodocyclus group. Thereafter, the ability of this anaerobic-aerobic microbial community to accumulate phosphorus with nitrate as its energy source was investigated. The reactor was shifted from anaerobic-aerobic running conditions to anaerobic-anoxic conditions by injection of nitrate; and its microbial community was monitored by PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). The reactor maintained a good phosphorus accumulation and similar SSCP microbial community patterns for a period of 17 days, suggesting that the same microbial community was able to respire both oxygen and nitrate. However, this situation was unstable, since a breakdown in phosphorus accumulation occurred thereafter.									94	5	0	0	71	0	97			0175-7598	1432-0614		WOS:000168842900019	11398934

The Sn isotope of cassiterite is very sensitive to metallogenic environment.The fluid composition, chemical reaction rate and physicochemical conditions(such as temperature,salinity,oxygen fugacity,pH value,etc.)may affect the Sn isotope composition of cassiterite.Cassiterite crystallized by deep fluid (such as magma source)is rich in heavy tin,while cassiterite crystallized by shallow fluid (such as formation fluid)is rich in light tin.Therefore,the Sn isotope of cassiterite has the potential to distinguish the genetic types of different deposits.Looking forward to the future,the research on Sn isotope is expected to make breakthroughs in the following aspects:①accurate determination of tin isotope reservoir data in various spheres;② accurate and rapid analysis of tin isotope in in-situ micro-area of Sn-bearing minerals;③ mechanism establishing of Sn isotope fractionation in hydrothermal deposits.By focusing on the changes of Sn isotope composition of tin-bearing minerals during magmatic-hydrothermal evolution,it is expected to reveal the properties and physical and chemical environment of tin-bearing fluids.Also,the controlling factors and tracing mechanism of Sn isotope fractionation in the mineralization process can be discussed from the perspective of source,evolution and precipitation of ore-forming fluid,and a Sn isotope evolution model in complex tin metallogenic systems can be established.The Sn isotope studies can provide new ideas for further understanding thesource,transportationandstorageprocesses of multi-type tin mineralization,provide key Sn isotope evidence for the identification of the genesis types and oreforming materials of disputed tin deposits,and then provide a new perspective for the study of large-scale tin polymetallic mineralization,which has important theoretical value and practical significance.			锡同位素是一种新兴的非传统稳定同位素,其在考古学及天体化学中的运用显示出非常大的示踪潜力和价值,然而目前其在地质学(尤其是矿床学)中的研究和应用前景缺乏系统介绍。本文总结分析了世界上目前所发表的主要天然及人工样品的锡同位素数据,发现天然样品中锡同位素组成有较大差异,其中玻璃陨石最富重锡(其delta122/118Sn值可达2.53),而黝锡矿(黄锡矿)最富轻锡(其delta120/116 Sn值可达-1.71)。其中,含锡矿物(如锡石和黝锡矿)中的锡同位素组成变化范围要远远大于全岩样品。地幔及地壳来源的不同岩性或地质体的全岩锡同位素组成有明显差别;锡同位素在一定条件下可以发生分馏,且分馏程度可能远远大于锡同位素的初始值差异。锡石锡同位素对成矿环境非常敏感,其形成时的流体成分、化学反应速率以及物化条件(如温度、盐度、氧逸度、pH值等)等因素均能影响其锡同位素的组成。深部流体(如岩浆来源)结晶的锡石富重锡,而浅部流体(如地层流体)的加入将使锡石富轻锡,因此锡石的锡同位素具有判别不同矿床成因类型的潜力。展望未来,锡同位素的研究有望在以下三方面取得突破:①各地球圈层锡同位素储库数据的精确测定;②矿物原位微区锡同位素的准确快速分析;③热液矿床锡同位素分馏机制的建立。聚焦岩浆-热液演化过程中含锡矿物的锡同位素组成变化,有望揭示含锡流体性质及物化环境,从成矿流体来源、演化、沉淀等角度探讨成矿过程中锡同位素分馏的控制因素及其示踪机制,建立复杂锡成矿系统中的锡同位素演化模型。系统的锡同位素研究可为深入认识多类型锡矿化的源、 运储过程提供新的思路,为判别有争议锡矿床的成因类型及成矿物质来源提供关键的锡同位素证据,进而为研究大规模锡多金属成矿作用提供全新的视角,具有重要的理论价值及现实意义。						0	1	0	0	0	0	1			0001-5717			CSCD:7118509

For mole fractions of gold greater than similar to 0.5, acetic acid adsorbs molecularly and desorbs intact with an activation energy of similar to 52 kJ/mol. This acetic acid is present as catemers, where the nature of the caterner is found to depend on gold concentration. When the relative gold concentration is less than similar to 0.33, adsorption of acetic acid at 80 K and heating to similar to 207 K forms ill-acetate species on the surface. On further heating, these can either thermally decompose to eventually evolve hydrogen, water and oxides of carbon, or form eta(2)- acetate species, where the coverage of reactively formed eta(2)-acetate species increases with decreasing gold concentration in the near surface region.

Mo incorporation stabilizes the tetragonal scheelite phase of BiVO4, thereby inducing a small blue shift of the band gap. This adverse effect can be partially compensated by incorporation of lower Mo amounts (up to ca. 4%), which stabilizes the particle morphology upon calcination. Both BiVO4@TiO2 and BiVO4:Mo@TiO2 heterojunction composites with TiO2 particle coatings in the 10 nm range were newly synthesized and displayed promising photocatalytic performance in MB degradation. Comparative studies with SnO2 heterojunctions revealed a superior influence of TiO2 deposition over SnO2 coating on both BiVO4 and Bi1-x/3V1-xMoxO4 oxide substrates. Different synthetic guidelines for BiVO4-based solid solutions and heterojunctions in photocatalytic wastewater treatment and water oxidation are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The photocatalytic activity of as-prepared hybrid was investigated using bacteria disinfection. The results indicated that the composite exhibited enhanced E. coli inactivation under visible light (VL) irradiation, with the complete inactivation of 7 log10 cfu/mL of cells reduction within 3 h, while the pristine g-C3N4 and MgTi2O5 almost showed no cell reduction under the same condition. The destruction of bacterial cell was investigated by fluorescence microscopic images and transmission electron microscopy analysis. The optimum photoactivity could be attributed to 1) the short charge transport distance and large interface contact area of the 2D/2D structure, 2) the efficient charge separation and spatially separated reductive and oxidative active sites originated from Z-scheme system. This work could shed lights on the design and fabrication of 2D/2D Z-scheme system for VL driven water disinfection.									31	2	0	0	7	1	31			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000480669500008

The composite CdS-ZnS was capable of simultaneous photocatalytic hydrogen production and organic degradation under visible light. The ZnS deposition on CdS helped to suppress the recombination of electron/hole pairs generated on the more reactive CdS, leading to faster hydrogen production and improved stability of the CdS-ZnS in comparison to the bare CdS catalyst. Deposition of Ru on the catalyst surface further increased its photo-reactivity by about 4 times for hydrogen production. The heterostructured nanoparticles were effective in photocatalytic hydrogen production together with the degradation of model organic substances, including formic acid, methanol, and ethanol. The highest hydrogen production rate was achieved by the (CdS-ZnS)/Ru catalyst at 266 mmol/m(2)-h in the formic acid solution with an energy conversion efficiency of 3.05% in visible light, and the corresponding organic degradation rate in terms of the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was estimated at 4272 mg COD/m(2)-h.

However, cysteines are susceptible to oxidation by Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species, leading to a loss of their catalytic function. Therefore, cysteine oxidation is emerging as a relevant physiological regulatory mechanism. Formation of a cyclic sulfenyl amide residue at the active site of redox-regulated proteins has been proposed as a protection mechanism against irreversible oxidation as the sulfenyl amide intermediate has been identified in several proteins. However, how and why only some specific cysteine residues in particular proteins react to form this intermediate is still unknown. In the present work using in-silico based tools, we have identified a constrained conformation that accelerates sulfenyl amide formation. By means of combined MD and QM/MM calculation we show that this conformation positions the NH backbone towards the sulfenic acid and promotes the reaction to yield the sulfenyl amide intermediate, in one step with the concomitant release of a water molecule. Moreover, in a large subset of the proteins we found a conserved beta sheet-loop-helix motif, which is present across different protein folds, that is key for sulfenyl amide production as it promotes the previous formation of sulfenic acid. For catalytic activity, in several cases, proteins need the Cysteine to be in the cysteinate form, i.e. a low pKa Cys. We found that the conserved motif stabilizes the cysteinate by hydrogen bonding to several NH backbone moieties. As cysteinate is also more reactive toward ROS we propose that the sheet-loop-helix motif and the constraint conformation have been selected by evolution for proteins that need a reactive Cys protected from irreversible oxidation. Our results also highlight how fold conservation can be correlated to redox chemistry regulation of protein function.									34	0	0	0	27	0	34			1553-734X	1553-7358		WOS:000352195700005	25741692

The XRD pattern confirmed the formation of a highly crystalline single phase orthorhombic ZAS. The FESEM and TEM micrographs exhibited that the size of the nanoparticles are in the range similar to 20-30 nm. An optical study showed a broad absorption edge from 400 to 1000 nm, with an estimated band gap of about similar to 1.48 eV. Considering this ideal band gap, ZAS was used as a photocatalyst for the photodecomposition of H2S under visible light irradiation to produce hydrogen for the first time. We obtained the utmost hydrogen evolution i.e., similar to 10 200 mmol h(-1) g(-1) for the naked ZAS (without a co-catalyst) catalyst under visible light, which is much higher than the earlier reported photocatalysts. Generally, in complex oxides of p-block metals, the bottom of the conduction band (CB) consists of the merely localized s and/or p orbitals which are largely dispersed. This large dispersion is responsible for a high electron mobility and extremely high photocatalytic activity. Therefore, a complex oxide (ZAS) of Ag, Zn and the p-block metal (Sb) is found to be a promising visible light active photocatalyst. This is the most stable, efficient and eco-friendly novel visible light active oxide photocatalyst for hydrogen production.									8	1	0	0	0	0	9			2050-7488			WOS:000325413000020		
J	Takaesu, Azusa; Watanabe, Kiyotaka; Takai, Shinji; Sasaki, Yukako; Orino, Koichi								Sequence analysis of dolphin ferritin H and L subunits and possible iron-dependent translational control of dolphin ferritin gene								ACTA VETERINARIA SCANDINAVICA				50						42	10.1186/1751-0147-50-42				OCT 27 2008	2008	Background: Iron-storage protein, ferritin plays a central role in iron metabolism. Ferritin has dual function to store iron and segregate iron for protection of iron-catalyzed reactive oxygen species. Tissue ferritin is composed of two kinds of subunits (H: heavy chain or heart-type subunit; L: light chain or liver-type subunit). Ferritin gene expression is controlled at translational level in iron-dependent manner or at transcriptional level in iron-independent manner. However, sequencing analysis of marine mammalian ferritin subunits has not yet been performed fully. The purpose of this study is to reveal cDNA-derived amino acid sequences of cetacean ferritin H and L subunits, and demonstrate the possibility of expression of these subunits, especially H subunit, by iron.Methods: Sequence analyses of cetacean ferritin H and L subunits were performed by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragments from cDNAs generated via reverse transcription-PCR of leukocyte total RNA prepared from blood samples of six different dolphin species (Pseudorca crassidens, Lagenorhynchus obliquidens, Grampus griseus, Globicephala macrorhynchus, Tursiops truncatus, and Delphinapterus leucas). The putative iron-responsive element sequence in the 5'-untranslated region of the six different dolphin species was revealed by direct sequencing of PCR fragments obtained using leukocyte genomic DNA.Results: Dolphin H and L subunits consist of 182 and 174 amino acids, respectively, and amino acid sequence identities of ferritin subunits among these dolphins are highly conserved (H: 99-100%, (99 -> 98); L: 98-100%). The conserved 28 bp IRE sequence was located -144 bp upstream from the initiation codon in the six different dolphin species.Conclusion: These results indicate that six different dolphin species have conserved ferritin sequences, and suggest that these genes are iron-dependently expressed.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0044-605X	1751-0147		WOS:000262154400001	18954429

Subsequently, heterogeneous Cu2O/NiO/TCPP nanocomposites were achieved. Assembly mechanism of the nanocomposites was investigated in detail. The results showed that, by coordination interaction and hydrogen bond, TCPP molecules can be strongly assembled onto the NiO-riveted Cu2O. Because of strong interaction among Cu2O, NiO and TCPP, and the enhanced light absorption, quick transfer of more photo-generated electrons can be achieved. Furthermore, the nanocomposite displayed a higher photocatalytic activity compared with other contrast materials (Cu2O/NiO/NiTCPP, Cu2O/NiO, Cu2O et al). It was attributed to the improved separation of charges as well as light absorption, which was originated from the well-matched band structure and special heterogeneous interface. This study will open up new perspectives for the fabrication and application of heterojunction photocatalysts. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Saadat, D; Harrison, DHT								The crystal structure of methylglyoxal synthase from Escherichia coli								STRUCTURE WITH FOLDING & DESIGN				7	3			309	317		10.1016/S0969-2126(99)80041-0				MAR 15 1999	1999	Background: The reaction mechanism of methylglyoxal synthase (MGS) is believed to be similar to that of triosephosphate isomerase (TIM). Both enzymes utilise dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to form an ene-diol(ate) phosphate intermediate as the first step of their reaction pathways. However, the second catalytic step in the MGS reaction pathway is characterized by the elimination of phosphate and collapse of the ene-diol(ate) to form methylglyoxal instead of reprotonation to form the isomer glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.Results: The crystal structure of MGS bound to formate and substoichiometric amounts of phosphate in the space group P6(5)22 has been determined at 1.9 Angstrom resolution, This structure shows that the enzyme is a homohexamer composed of interacting five-stranded beta/alpha proteins, rather than the hallmark odp barrel structure of TIM, The conserved residues His19, Asp71,and His98 in each of the three monomers in the asymmetric unit bind to a formate ion that is present in the crystallization conditions. Differences in the three monomers in the asymmetric unit are localized at the mouth of the active site and can be ascribed to the presence or absence of a bound phosphate ion.Conclusions: In agreement with site-directed mutagenesis and mechanistic enzymology, the structure suggests that Asp71 acts as the catalytic base. Further, Asp20 and Asp101 are involved in intersubunit salt bridges. These salt bridges may provide a pathway for transmitting allosteric information.									37	0	0	0	35	0	42			0969-2126			WOS:000079411100011	10368300

Water oxidation reaction (WOR), the anodic reaction of water electrolyzers, requires large overpotential and limits the overall efficiency, and active and stable WOR electrocatalysts are needed. We prepare ultrasmall iridium oxide similar to nanoparticles (IrOx, similar to 1.23 nm in diameter) incorporated in nitrogen-doped carbon via electropolymerization of 1,10-phenanthroline-based molecules in the presence of IrOx followed by calcination under nitrogen. The resulting electrodes are active and stable to electrochemically catalyze WOR in acid. The most active electrode, IrOx@P(2Nphen), requires only 270 mV overpotentials to reach 10 mA cm(-2) WOR current densities and exhibits the mass-normalized specific activity of 1.75 A mgIr1 at 310 mV overpotentials. The abundant N atoms in the nitrogen-doped carbon provide hydrogen bonding to facilitate the charge transfer process, and the electron interaction between the N atoms and IrOx alters the adsorption energy of water oxidation intermediate (OH*). Both factors contribute to the observed high WOR performance. A water electrolyzer is assembled using the IrOx@P(2Nphen) as the anode and carbon paper supported commercial Pt/C catalysts as the cathode. Only 1.54 V cell voltage is required to reach the 10 mA cm(-2) current densities for overall water splitting. This study provides a facile method to prepare ultrasmall IrOx incorporated nitrogen-doped carbon for WOR, and this synthetic method can potentially be applied to prepare other nanoparticle incorporated carbon-based materials.

Responses to drought stress have mostly been studied in the Columbia accession, which is predominantly used in plant research. However, the reactions to drought stress are complex and our understanding of the responses that contribute to maintaining plant growth during mild drought (MD) is very limited. Here, we studied the mechanisms with which natural accessions react to MD at a physiological and molecular level during early leaf development. We documented variations in MD responses among natural accessions and used transcriptome sequencing of a drought-sensitive accession, ICE163, and a drought-insensitive accession, Yeg-1, to gain insights into the mechanisms underlying this discrepancy. This revealed that ICE163 preferentially induces jasmonate- and anthocyanin-related pathways, which are beneficial in biotic stress defense, whereas Yeg-1 has a more pronounced activation of abscisic acid signaling, the classical abiotic stress response. Related physiological traits, including the content of proline, anthocyanins, and reactive oxygen species, stomatal closure, and cellular leaf parameters, were investigated and linked to the transcriptional responses. We can conclude that most of these processes constitute general drought response mechanisms that are regulated similarly in drought-insensitive and -sensitive accessions. However, the capacity to close stomata and maintain cell expansion under MD appeared to be major factors that allow to better sustain leaf growth under MD.									9	0	0	0	4	0	9			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000671555900034	33693949

Here we report a metallic stack design achieving these goals for ORR, based on atomically precise materials synthesis. Au@Pd@Pt nanostructures with atomically thin Pt shells and high-index surfaces form an excellent platform for integrating the effects of electronic structures, surface facets, and substrate stabilization to boost ORR performance. Au@Pd@Pt trisoctahedrons (TOH) achieve mass activity 6.1 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C and dramatically enhanced durability beyond 1.0 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode in oxidation potential. Meanwhile, Pt comprises only 3.2% of the nanostructures. To further improve the ORR activity and demonstrate the versatility of our strategy, we implement the same design in PtNi alloy electrocatalysts. The Au@Pd@PtNi TOHs exhibit mass activity 14.3 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C as well as excellent durability. This work demonstrates an alternative strategy for fabricating high-performance and low-cost catalysts, and highlights the importance of simultaneous surface and interfacial engineering with atomic precision in designing catalysts.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000433048600033

To elucidate the mechanism, we examined the effects of methanol on the enzymatic activity of catalase, catalase gene (CAT1) expression, and ultrastructure of C. reinhardtii cells. CAT1 relative expression was detected by real time RT-PCR. The cellular ultrastructure was investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Catalase-mediated oxygen evolution from H2O2 was assayed with a Clark-type electrode. The localization of catalase activity in C. reinhardtii cells grown in the presence of methanol was studied by a method based on cytochemical staining with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine-tetrahydrochloride (DAB). The cytochemical data obtained in this study confirmed catalase localization in mitochondria of C. reinhardtii cells. It was shown biochemically that mitochondrial catalase activity of the alga can be enhanced by methanol. CAT1 gene expression after 4 h of growth with methanol was 16-fold higher than in the control samples. Methanol addition induced quantitative changes in ultrastructure of C. reinhardtii cells: the volume of C. reinhardtii cells and fractions of cell area occupied by chloroplasts decreased, the areas of vacuoles, mitochondria, and plastoglobules increased. The results suggest that mitochondrial catalase takes part in the oxidation of methanol.									2	0	0	0	1	1	2			0921-8971	1573-5176		WOS:000505357400003

Phylogenetic analyses revealed that this putative GST belongs to the Lambda class, a plant-specific group with unknown functions. We expressed GmGSTL1 in heterologous systems, including tobacco BY-2 cells and Arabidopsis thaliana, to test its ability to protect the cell/plant against salinity stress. Compared with the control, we observed a marked reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in transgenic cells under salt treatment, and their survival rate was also improved. Similarly, expression of GmGST1 in transgenic A. thaliana also alleviated stress symptoms under salt treatment. To address further the possible protective mechanisms of GmGSTL1, we identified two candidate flavonoid interactants (quercetin and kaemferol) of the GmGSTL1 protein from soybean leaf extract. Exogenous application of quercetin could reduce salinity-induced ROS accumulation in BY-2 cells and leaf chlorosis in A. thaliana.									50	11	0	0	46	0	62			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:000333096200009	24399237

Novel two-step redox pyrolysis with accurate control of ZIF-67 carbonization and Co ion transformation during pyrolysis was applied. Co@Co3O4-NC was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope, high-resolution transmission electron microscope, powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and nitrogen adsorption-desorption experiment. Co@Co3O4-NC displayed a strong electrochemical catalysis towards both H2O2 oxidation and H2O2 reduction. By using Co@Co3O4-NC prepared sensor, efficient detection of H2O2 was achieved not only by the H2O2 oxidation at a positive potential but also by the H2O2 reduction at a negative potential. At 0.30 V, the resulting sensor exhibited a rapid amperometric response (2 s), low detection limit (0.056 mu M) and broad detection linear range (0.1 mu M-40.0 mM). Besides, at -0.30 V, the resulting sensor also exhibited a rapid amperometric response (4 s), low detection limit (0.96 mu M) and broad detection linear range (2.0 mu M-60.0 mM). Additionally, Co@Co3O4-NC prepared sensor also presented a notable selectivity, high reproducibility and long-term stability. Our results proved that Co@Co3O4-NC was an efficient electro-catalyst for H2O2 redox reaction, and Co@Co3O4-NC prepared sensor could be a promising sensing platform for the nonenzymatic detection of H2O2.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000625327400001

These biochemical changes may provide chemical markers for helping to more accurately determine the time since death (post-mortem interval), which is challenging to establish with current observation-based methodologies. In this study blood pH and changes in concentration of six metabolites (lactic acid, hypoxanthine, uric acid, ammonia, NADH and formic acid) were examined post-mortem over a 96 hour period in blood taken from animal corpses (rat and pig) and blood from rats and humans stored in vitro. The pH and the concentration of all six metabolites changed post-mortem but the extent and rate of change varied. Blood pH in corpses fell from 7.4 to 5.1. Concentrations of hypoxanthine, ammonia, NADH and formic acid all increased with time and these metabolites may be potential markers for postmortem interval. The concentration of lactate increased and then remained at an elevated level and changes in the concentration were different in the rat compared to the human and pig. This is the first systematic study of multiple metabolic changes post-mortem and demonstrates the nature and extent of the changes that occur, in addition to identifying potential markers for estimating post-mortem interval.									107	3	0	0	64	0	112			1932-6203			WOS:000327539800145	24278469

The treatment modality utilizes nontoxic agents called photosensitizers and harmless visible light to generate reactive oxygen species which result in microbial cells' killing. Hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) as a novel and affordable photosensitizer has been used in treating various clinical diseases for years, but few applications in infection. In this report, we studied the bactericidal effects of the HMME-mediated photodynamic reaction on the pathogenic microbes in supragingival plaque which can lead to many oral infectious diseases such as caries, gingivitis, and so on. Our findings demonstrated that HMME promoted an effective action in bacterial reduction with the application of laser energy. Moreover, the antimicrobial activities were dramatically enhanced as the HMME concentration and exposure time were increased, but reached a plateau when matched the appropriate agent concentration and illumination. It was found that the survival fraction of microorganisms is exponentially dependent on the product of HMME concentration and irradiation time. These promising results suggest the HMME may be an excellently cost-effective photosensitizing agent for mediating PACT in the treatment of supragingival plaque-related diseases. An optimized HMME concentration and irradiation time has been found to achieve the best results under our experimental conditions. The high HMME concentration matching short curative time, or vice versa, can achieve the similar therapeutic effect, which may provide more flexible treatment plans according to specific conditions.									14	1	0	0	11	0	16			0175-7598	1432-0614		WOS:000319136300035	23615742

Cold isostatic pressing at 200 MPa was used in the formation process. Physical properties of the obtained artifacts prepared with two raw materials are quite different, the reason can be found in their pyrolysis behavior and sintering behavior. Thermogravimetry-mass spectrometer results show that H-2, CH4, CO2 and H2O are the common gaseous products, however, between 400 and 600 degrees C the M-LO may generate lightweight hydrocarbon component which was confirmed by thermogravimetry-infrared spectroscopy. A remarkable difference between the flexural strength of M-LO and M-HO was explained by the microstructure evolution observed with in situ scanning electron microscopy. For M-LO, cracks are mainly transgranular, giving little chance for interconnection, while in M-HO, cracks are mainly intergranular and may connect to form long cracks. A mechanism of crack formation caused by inhomogeneous shrinkage was proposed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									27	3	0	0	2	0	28			0008-6223	1873-3891		WOS:000291959300008

The evolution of an ordered nanostructure of Cu(0) showing a nearly amorphous nature is discussed, and it is proposed that it is due to a coupling interaction between the Cu precursor and the unpaired O of the COOR group, associated with water molecules, among pHEMA molecules. The hybrids showed a negative surface charge and considerable improvement in blood compatibility compared to neat pHEMA and the widely used biomaterial polysulfonate. (C) 2008 Acta Materialia Inc.

Photoprocessing of the ice and return to the ISM								MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY				501	1			491	506		10.1093/mnras/staa3689				FEB 2021	2021	To explain the properties of dust in the interstellar medium (ISM), the presence of a refractory organic mantle is necessary. The outflows of AGB stars are among the main contributors of stellar dust to the ISM. We present the first study of the refractory organic contribution of AGB stars to the ISM. Based on laboratory experiments, we included a new reaction in our extended chemical kinetics model: the photoprocessing of volatile complex ices into inert refractory organic material. The refractory organic feedback of AGB outflows to the ISM is estimated using observationally motivated parent species and grids of models of C-rich and O-rich outflows. Refractory organic material is mainly inherited from the gas phase through accretion on to the dust and subsequent photoprocessing. Grain-surface chemistry, initiated by photodissociation of ices, produces only a minor part and takes place in a sub-monolayer regime in almost all outflows. The formation of refractory organic material increases with outflow density and depends on the initial gas-phase composition. While O-rich dust is negligibly covered by refractory organics, C-rich dust has an average coverage of 3-9 per cent, but can be as high as 8-22 per cent. Although C-rich dust does not enter the ISM bare, its average coverage is too low to influence its evolution in the ISM or significantly contribute to the coverage of interstellar dust. This study opens up questions on the coverage of other dust-producing environments. It highlights the need for an improved understanding of dust formation and for models specific to density structures within the outflow.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000608474800038

The chlorophyll a fluorescence induction curve in each treatment was measured simultaneously using the OJIP-test data analysis method. The standardized data, specific activity parameters, performance index, total performance index, and energy distribution ratio of the related optical system Ⅱ (PSⅡ) were obtained. The results showed that drought stress: 1) increased the variable fluorescence intensity and decreased the electron transfer efficiency of leaves (Psi_(EO), phi_(EO), phi_(RO)); 2) decreased the absorption, capture, dissipation, and transfer of light energy per unit area (ABS/CS_O, DI_O/CS_O, ET_O/CS_O, RE_O/CS_O), but had little effect on drought tolerant varieties; 3) decreased the energy connectivity between PSⅡ units and electron transfer between these photosystems; 4) led to the (oxygen-evolving complex, OEC) inactivation of the PSⅡ oxygen evolution complex and imbalance of electron transfer between the PSⅡ acceptor and donor sides; 5) The net photosynthetic rate of leaves of XJT9907 and XJT9916 decreased by 32.2% and 10.3%, respectively; 6) the drought-tolerant cultivar, XJT9916, prevented over-excitation of energy by strong energy dissipation (DI_O/CS_O, DI_O/RC), resulting in a lower reduction in the net photosynthetic rate of the leaves than in the drought-sensitive cultivar, XJT9907. When the soil water content of XJT9907 and XJT9916 beet leaf clusters was 45%~50% of the field water holding capacity, the photochemical activity of the leaf photosynthetic system was reduced, the electron transfer reaction and the Calvin-Benson cycle was out of balance, and the photosynthetic mechanism stability and light energy utilization efficiency were reduced, leading to leaf light inhibition, thereby reducing the photosynthetic capacity of the leaf. The reduction in the photosynthetic capacity of sugar beet under drought stress is related to the down-regulation of PSⅡ function. Compared with Fv/Fm, the performance index, PItotal, can be used as a sensitivity index for screening drought-resistant genotypes.			为探索甜菜(Beta vulgaris)叶丛期叶片光合机构和功能对干旱胁迫的响应机制,以抗旱性相对不同的品种 XJT9907(旱敏感型)和XJT9916(耐旱型)为材料,在甜菜叶丛期控水为45%~50%田间持水量持续7 d时,利用植物效率分析仪(Handy-PEA)测定各处理叶片的叶绿素a荧光诱导动力学曲线(OJIP曲线),同时通过JIP-test数据分析方法,获得有关光系统Ⅱ(PSⅡ)标准化数据、比活性参数、性能指数、总性能指数和能量分配比率。结果表明: 1)干旱胁迫增加了XJT9907和XJT9916叶片可变荧光强度,降低叶片电子传递效率(Psi_(EO), phi_(EO), phi_(RO));2)降低单位面积光能的吸收、捕获、耗散和传递(ABS/CS_O, DI_O/CS_O, ET_O/CS_O, RE_O/CS_O),其中对耐旱型品种XJT9916的影响较小; 3)降低了PSⅡ单元之间的能量连通性和光系统之间的电子传递能力;4) PSⅡ放氧复合体(OEC)失活和PSⅡ受体侧与供体侧电子之间的不平衡;5) XJT9907和XJT9916叶片净光合速率分别降低32.2 %和10.3 %;6)耐旱型品种XJT9916通过较强的能量耗散(DI_O/CS_O, DI_O/RC)防止了能量被过度激发,致使叶片的净光合速率降低幅度低于旱敏感型XJT9907。 XJT9907和XJT9916甜菜叶丛期土壤含水量为45%~50%田间持水量时,叶片光合系统光化学活性降低,电子传递反应和Calvin-Benson循环之间平衡失调,光合机构稳定性和光能利用效率降低,导致叶片光抑制,从而降低了叶片的光合能力。由此可知,干旱胁迫下甜菜光合能力的降低与PSⅡ功能下调有关,与Fv/Fm相比,性能指数PItotal可作为筛选抗旱基因型品种的敏感性指标。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1001-0629			CSCD:7051541

It has been hypothesised that nitrogen fixation was crucial in injecting the Mediterranean Sea with bioavailable nitrogen (N) during sapropel events. However, the evolution of the N biogeochemical cycle of sapropels is poorly understood. For example, the role of the complementary removal reactions like anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) has not been investigated because the traditional lipid biomarkers for anammox, ladderane fatty acids, are not stable over long periods in the sedimentary record. Using an alternative lipid biomarker for anammox, bacteriohopanetetrol stereoisomer (BHT isomer), we present here for the first time N removal throughout the progression, e.g. formation, propagation, and termination, of basin-wide anoxic events. BHT isomer and ladderanes were analysed in sapropel records taken from three eastern Mediterranean sediment cores, spanning S1 to Pliocene sapropels. Ladderanes were rapidly degraded in sediments, as recently as the S5 sapropel. BHT isomer, however, was present in all sapropel sediments, as far back as the Pliocene, and clearly showed the response of anammox bacteria to marine water column redox shifts in high-resolution records. Two different N removal scenarios were observed in Mediterranean sapropels. During S5, anammox experienced Black Sea-type water column conditions, with the peak of BHT isomer coinciding with the core of the sapropel. Under the alternative scenario observed in the Pliocene sapropel, the anammox biomarker peaked at onset and termination of said sapropel, which may indicate sulfide inhibition of anammox during the core of sapropel deposition. This study shows the use of BHT isomer as a biomarker for anammox in the marine sediment record and highlights its potential in reconstructing anammox during past anoxic events that are too old for ladderanes to be applied, e.g. the history of oxygen minimum zone expansion and oceanic anoxic events.									15	2	0	0	4	0	17			1726-4170	1726-4189		WOS:000472159200002		
J	Bunt, J. R.; Waanders, F. B.								Pipe reactor gasification studies of a south african bituminous coal blend. Part 1-Carbon and volatile matter behaviour as function of feed coal particle size reduction								FUEL				88	4			585	594		10.1016/j.fuel.2008.10.019				APR 2009	2009	The Sasol-Lurgi fixed-bed dry-bottom (FBDB) MKIV gasifiers are proven to be robust as far as acceptable coal properties are concerned, in particular its ability to accommodate a range of particle size distributions (PSD) fractions. Over the years, the findings from a number of studies conducted at Sasol have played a key role in the optimization of the Sasol-Lurgi gasifiers as far as the limited amount of coal preparation by crushing and screening is concerned. The continued optimization efforts by Sasol over many years have led to a robust and reliable gasification technology for coal conversion, and more improvements are envisaged for the near future.In this study, gasification profiles inside real coal beds were investigated experimentally using a pilot scale combustor unit (pipe reactor), where the top size of the coal blend was systematically reduced from 75 mm, 53 mm and 37.5 mm. The pilot scale combustor has an inside diameter of 400 mm, is approximately 3 m long and the combustion rate is controlled by regulating the oxygen/nitrogen ratio of the gas feed. Ash is not removed continuously, so the combustion front moves upwards through the coal bed with time, resulting in a temperature gradient across the bed. The combustion process can be stopped at any point in time by removing all of the oxygen from the feed gas (i.e. quenching with nitrogen). The combustor was constructed so that it can be tilted onto its side and opened up like a coffin to allow sample taking and visual inspection of the combustion profile. In this case, equivalent sized slices were taken across the length of the reactor bed contents and the samples were analysed for PSD, proximate analysis, ultimate analysis, Fisher assay and coal char CO(2) reactivity. This paper focuses on the coal property transformational behaviour (as characterized by the proximate analysis and Fischer tar results) through packed coal beds of different feed coal size distributions.The proximate analysis results showed clear reaction zone profiles to be occurring within the pipe reactor, i.e. drying, pyrolysis, reduction and combustion (ash bed) zones, in agreement with the SL-FBDB MKIV commercial-scale findings. It was found that a decrease in feed coal particle size resulted in better heat transfer across the particles with ensuing faster volatile matter and tar evolution. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

On the other side, no anisotropy remains above 1765 K. This anisotropy reflects the fact that aluminum atoms occupy 2/3 of the octahedral sites in the compact hexagonal sublattice formed by the oxygen atoms.We have also reacted alumina when heated under a constant flow of nitrogen. Nitriding alumina occurs around 1765 K and then forms aluminum mononitride, AlN, ZnS-Wurtzite type hexagonal structure. The thermal expansion of this mononitride cell is linear and is characterized by an anisotropy of the direction 'a' in comparison to the direction 'c' of about 17%. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this view, the progress of chemical oxidative reactions of six Italian white wines during storage (10 months after bottling), in different packaging, was monitored by means of selected oenological parameters. The optical density at 420 nm, an index of browning, showed a progressive increase that fitted the zero-order kinetic rate. The onset of wine browning was further tested by means of accelerated ageing in controlled temperature conditions which results, modelled using the rate constants approach, showed an Arrhenius-like dependence from temperature, allowing to estimate apparent activation energies of oxidative chemical browning (range: 46.8-88.3 kJ mol(-1)). Kinetic and thermodynamic approach provided a useful tool to predict quality changes of white wines during storage with respect to packaging conditions.									12	0	0	0	6	0	12			0950-5423	1365-2621		WOS:000394510600021

To bridge the material gap, we studied some of the promising and new electrocatalysts for MOR. We synthesized 1%wt Pt/TMCs (TMCs of group IV (Ti and Zr), group V (V, Nb and Ta) and group VI (W)) via wet impregnation method as low loading electrocatalysts for MOR in alkaline media. The synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), N-2 physisorption using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The activity of the electrocatalysts were elucidated for MOR in alkaline media via combination of experimental and theoretical methods. Among all the investigated electrocatalysts, Pt/NbC was found to have the highest specific activity (3.58 mA cm(Pt)(-2)) while Pt/ZrC had the least (0.410 mA cm(Pt)(-2)). Tafel slope measurements for Pt/TMC electrocatalysts with the exception of Pt/TiC varied from region of low potential to region of high potential and were 121.2 +/- 11 mV dec(-1) and 234 +/- 10 mV dec(-1) respectively, indicating change in limiting steps from C-H scission to CO poisoning. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the binding energies of H and CO on the Pt/TMC surfaces were correlated to their specific activity, and volcano-type relationships were discovered, which indicated that neither too weak nor too strong bond of H and CO on the electrocatalyst surfaces were favorable for high activity during MOR. Finally, a feasible reaction mechanism for Pt/TMC electrocatalysts in MOR was proposed based on the experimental and theoretical results.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000600990800001

Great strides have been taken to reduce SO2 emissions, but with the growth of specifically China, and to a lesser extent India, it is on the rise again. The electrolysis of aqueous solutions of dissolved SO2 holds huge environmental potential in that SO2 is converted to sulphuric acid (H2SO4) and at the same time hydrogen gas is produced. A further benefit or incentive is that a sulphur depolarised electrolyser (SDE) operates at an applied potential that is about one volt lower than that of a regular water electrolyser. In taking this technology forward the greatest improvement to be made is in developing a suitable electrocatalyst, which is also the 'lowest hanging fruit' in that very limited research and development has been conducted on the electrocatalyst for this process. In this work, density functional theory is employed to model the electro-oxidation of SO2 on single crystal planes of the 4d and 5d transition metals. Two reaction mechanisms are considered, a HSO3 intermediate pathway and a SO3 intermediate pathway. The binding energies of all intermediates are found to scale with the surface reactivity (measured as the adsorption of OH). Irrespective of the pathway water needs to be activated and reduction of SO2 to elemental sulphur must be avoided. This requirement alone calls for an electrode potential of at least 0.7-0.8 V for all the investigated transition metals and thus challenges the proclaimed goal to operate the SDE at 0.6 V. A high chemical barrier is further found to severely limit the oxidation reaction on reactive metals. A much higher catalytic activity can be obtained on precious metals but at the cost of running the reaction at high overpotentials.									28	0	0	0	0	0	28			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000335818600042	24728561

The microstructure and phase composition of the coatings with different MoSi2 contents before and after static oxidation were investigated. This composite material has both excellent radiating properties and outstanding oxidation resistance. The total emissivity values of the as-prepared coatings are all above 0.8450 in the wavelength of 300 similar to 2,500 nm. Meanwhile, the as-prepared M40 coating also has superior thermal endurance after the isothermal oxidation of 1,200 degrees C for 180 min with only 0.27% weight loss, which contributes to the appropriate viscosity of the binder to relieve thermal stress defects. This material has broad application prospects in thermal protection.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2296-8016			WOS:000713494700001

Change in Water Isotope Composition as a Tool for Influencing Human Psychoemotional State								JOURNAL OF WATER CHEMISTRY AND TECHNOLOGY				43	3			185	192		10.3103/S1063455X21030073				MAY 2021	2021	Today, the critical mass of knowledge about water and the prospects for its transformation because of human activity have become so significant that they undoubtedly require new generalizations and comprehension. Analysis of water problems leads to the idea that the substance of water is programmed for life, its development, correction, and protection. The realization of this potential of water is provided by the energy and information capacity of its molecules and intermolecular compounds. Water is a special substance that is extremely necessary for a living world. Each of the "anomalies", oddities of water in the "water-life" link easily fits into a certain program of creation, preservation, maintenance, and evolution of life. Life in the forms we know could not have appeared outside of water in its liquid state, outside of water "anomalies". Consequently, the water shell on our planet should proceed the emergence of life (A. Henderson arguably defended this idea at the beginning of the last century). Only then, having passed a period of water development, life came out onto land, nevertheless preserving its water nature. With a somewhat reduced, "chemical" look, living matter looks like an "aqueous solution, since every living organism is, to one degree or another, really an aqueous solution, and almost all chemical processes that provide vital activity are reduced to chemical reactions in an aqueous solution." Water is the most abundant substance in nature that a person encounters daily throughout his life. However, this is a rather complex object for understanding. If scientists manage to reveal at least a little the true secret of water, new pages will open in chemistry, biology, and this, in turn, will open new unexplored compounds, new materials and, perhaps, unexpected forms of life, where all macromolecules of DNA and proteins contain a certain the proportion of heavy hydrogen and heavy oxygen molecules and organelles.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1063-455X	1934-936X		WOS:000680544000001

Increase in methane flux and dissociation of iron and manganese oxides recorded in a methane-derived carbonate nodule in the eastern margin of the Sea of Japan								GeoResJ				9-12				104	16		10.1016/j.grj.2016.10.001				Dec. 2016	2016	High resolution analyses of an aggregate of aragonite crystals in a methane-derived carbonate nodule revealed evolution of interstitial water geochemistry associated with increases in methane flux at the Umitaka Spur gas seep site in the Sea of Japan. Geochemical data were obtained from the aggregate using Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), millimeter-scale powdering, and electron probe micro analysis. Most elements measured by LA-ICP-MS, and carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions (delta13C and delta18O, respectively) of aragonite, have symmetrical patterns in the aggregate. Concentrations of Ba, delta13CCaCO3, and delta18OCaCO3 increase monotonically towards the center of the aggregate (delta13CCaCO3; from -12 0/00 to -4 0/00VPDB), while rare earth elements (REEs) and Mn oscillate. Iron peaks are located closest to those of light REEs, and the shale-normalized pattern of a REE peak event is enriched in middle REEs, suggesting dissociation of Fe-oxides as the source of the REEs. The monotonically changing geochemical data and fan-shaped, acicular aragonites growing inwardly from the aggregate rim, suggest aggregate formation from rim to center. Therefore, the peak position of Mn to the interior of that of Fe, suggests an increase in dissolved Mn after the dissociation of Fe-oxides. The isotopic trends continue into the surrounding matrix, where delta13CCaCO3 reaches ~-20 0/00VPDB, close to the delta13C of dissolved inorganic carbon currently found in the sulfate-methane transition (SMT).

However, the microscopic pathway of synchronous proton-promoted and ligand-promoted decomposition process for Al 13 is still in the status of ambiguity. Herein, we applied differential mass spectrometry method and DFT calculation to study the initial detailed process of Al 13 decomposition under the presence of proton and salicylic acid (H 2 Sal). Mass results showed that the mononuclear Al 3 + -H 2 Sal complexes dominated the resulting Al species, whereas the monodentate complex Al 13 HSal 6 + was not observed in the spectra. The difference of decomposition levels between the ligand/Al ratio 0.2 and 0.5 cases revealed that proton and ligand performed synergistic effect in initial Al 13 decomposition process, and the proton transfer determined the ring closure efficiency. The ring closure reaction is the prerequisite for the collapse of Al 13 structure and detachment of the mononuclear complex. DFT calculations reveal that hydrogen bond plays an important role in inducing the formation of chelated complex accompanying proton transfer. Attachment of protons at the bridging OH - can elongate and weaken the critical bond between targeted Al 3 + and p4 -O 2- resulting from delocalization of electron pairs in the oxygen atom. These results demonstrate the detailed mechanism of Al13 composition promoted by lig-and and proton, and provide significant understanding for further application and control of Al13.

Yet, reports on metabolic characteristics of non-model cyanobacteria are scarce. In this report, we show that an Indian euryhaline Synechococcus sp. BDU 130192 has biomass accumulation comparable to a model marine cyanobacterium and contains approximately double the amount of total carbohydrates, but significantly lower protein levels compared to Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 cells. Based on its annotated chromosomal genome sequence, we present a genome scale metabolic model (GSMM) of this cyanobacterium, which we have named as iSyn706. The model includes 706 genes, 908 reactions, and 900 metabolites. The difference in the flux balance analysis (FBA) predicted flux distributions between Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 and Synechococcus sp. BDU130192 strains mimicked the differences in their biomass compositions. Model-predicted oxygen evolution rate for Synechococcus sp. BDU130192 was found to be close to the experimentally-measured value. The model was analyzed to determine the potential of the strain for the production of various industrially-useful products without affecting growth significantly. This model will be helpful to researchers interested in understanding the metabolism as well as to design metabolic engineering strategies for the production of industrially-relevant compounds.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6				2218-1989		WOS:000539315800006	32365713

Compound 1 was characterized by using several physical methods including single-crystal X-ray diffractometry. Compound 1 . 0.5H(2)O crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pbca (No. 61) with a = 38.780(2), b = 22.058(4), c = 19.719(5) Angstrom, V = 16 868(8) Angstrom(3) and Z = 16. There are two independent equivalents of compound 1 in the crystallographic asymmetric unit and there is a single unique water molecule in the crystal lattice. Both manganese atoms in each of the independent dinuclear units are in the +3 oxidation state and they are bridged by one oxo ligand (O2-) and two acetate groups. Each manganese atom is also bound to one facially-coordinating tridentate bpea ligand, with the aliphatic nitrogen donor situated trans to an acetate oxygen atom. Deviations from idealized octahedral symmetry at each manganese center are consistent with expectations for a d(4) electronic configuration. Compound 1 has an average Mn...Mn separation of 3.11 Angstrom and an average Mn-(mu L-O)-Mn angle of 122.7 degrees. The electronic absorption spectrum of 1 in CH3CN is very similar to other compounds that contain the {Mn-2(mu-O)(mu-O2CCH3)(2)}(2+) core. A cyclic voltammogram of 1 in CH3CN exhibits an oxidation wave (III,III to III,IV) at +0.65 V and a reduction wave (III,III to III,II) at -0.39 V versus the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc(+)) couple. The IR spectrum of 1 reveals two strong bands at 1566 and 1432 cm(-1) corresponding to the bridging acetate groups present in the compound. The X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum of 1 in dry CH3CN at 77 and 4 K is featureless. Compound I disproportionates in an H2O/CH3CN solvent mixture to give the (III,IV) binuclear species [Mn2O2(O2CCH3)(bpea)(2)](2+), which displays a characteristic 16-line g=2 EPR signal.									45	0	0	0	3	0	45			0020-1693	1873-3255		WOS:A1995QN47500036

Semiconductor-based photocatalytic hydrogen production technology is one of the ideal processes for direct solar energy conversion and storage that has been widely studied. The development of highly efficient photocatalysts is essential for the cost-effective and large-scale production of hydrogen. CdS-based semiconductor photocatalysts have attracted significant attention due to their unique advantages, including strong visible light absorption capacity, suitable band edge levels and excellent electronic charge transfer. However, unlike TiO2 with good photostability, the intrinsic drawback of photocorrosion of CdS-based semiconductors significantly challenges their durable application in photocatalysis. This review focuses on recent advances in material design and strategies for improving the anti-photocorrosion of CdS-based photocatalysts for applications in photocatalytic overall water splitting to produce hydrogen. Moreover, brief prospective development and challenges in the synthesis of anti-corrosion CdS-based photocatalysts are also presented.									136	8	1	0	13	0	137			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000509545700001	31904050

Among reported water-splitting systems, one approach has focused on hybrid systems with molecular catalysts or molecular light-harvesting systems that are combined with nanostructured materials. In this perspective we summarize recent developments in operation and fabrication strategies for various water-splitting devices constructed from electrodes (electrochemical cells) or photoelectrodes (photoelectrochemical cells) using molecular engineering.

The formation of flower-like architecture can be attributed to the presence of PEG, which provides nucleation sites for the growth of nanosheets due to strong interactions between activated oxygen in PEG and Ag+ ions. The prepared 3D flower-like Ag3PO4 exhibits highly efficient photocatalytic activity for the photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible light irradiation. The average photocatalytic rate of flower-like Ag3PO4 is more than 2 and 30 times of that of pure Ag3PO4 and commercial TiO2 (Degussa P25), respectively. The possible mechanism for the excellent performance of flower-like Ag3PO4 microstructures is proposed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is one of the promising technologies for converting intermittent solar energy into storable hydrogen energy, to tackle these issues. As the core component in a PEC system, photoelectrodes have been modified by various strategies including nanostructuring, facet-engineering, elemental doping, and heterostructured engineering. Apart from these techniques, numerous effective post-synthetic treatments have also been used to facilely and powerfully boost the physicochemical properties of photoelectrodes, for the enhancement of their PEC performance. Among them, a number of post-treatments can selectively influence photoelectrode surface and subsurface areas, altering surface states that play crucial roles in the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction. In virtue of such post-treatments, we summarize recently reported post-synthetic treatments for enhanced PEC applications. Post-treatment methods are classified into three sections: chemical treatments, electrochemical and irradiation-based treatments, and post-annealing treatments. In the end, a summary and outlook section regarding the utilization of post-treatments for PEC applications have been provided. This review can provide inspiration for further studies about post-treatments, not only in the PEC water splitting field, but also in other aspects, such as electrolysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000722657700001

However, only a few studies have focused on the switching phenomenon of crossbar RRAM in detail. The main purpose of this study is to understand the formation and disruption of the conductive filament occurring at the crossbar center by real-time transmission electron microscope observation. Core-shell Ni/NiO nanowires are utilized to form a cross-structure, which restrict the position of the conductive filament to the crosscenter. A significant morphological change can be observed near the crossbar center, which results from the out-diffusion and backfill of oxygen ions. Energy dispersive spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy demonstrate that the movement of the oxygen ions leads to the evolution of the conductive filament, followed by redox reactions. Moreover, the distinct reliability of the crossbar device is measured via ex situ experiments. In this work, the switching mechanism of the crossbar core-shell nanowire structure is beneficial to overcome the problem of nanoscale minimization. The experimental method shows high potential to fabricate high-density RRAM devices, which can be applied to 3D stacked package technology and neuromorphic computing systems.									41	2	0	0	2	0	41			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000424656800014	29205791

Herein, we report three dimensional MoS2 nanoflowers with hexagonal (2H) phase for supercapacitor application. The 2H-MoS2 nanoflowers based supercapacitor electrodes exhibit a high specific capacitance of 382 Fg(-1) at a current density of 1 Ag-1 in three electrodes measurements with 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The symmetric solid state supercapacitor device with 2H-MoS2 nanoflowers electrodes and PVA-Na2SO4 electrolyte exhibits an outstanding cell performance with an energy density of 16.4 Wh kg(-1) (measured at a constant current density of 0.2 A g(-1)) and an excellent capacitance retention of 97.5% after 4000 cycles. The outstanding performance of 2H-MoS2 nanoflowers based electrodes can be attributed to the 3D flower like architecture with large number of exposed edges of different petals and their wettability due to oxygen containing functional groups.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000574894200001

The Ir:TiO2 photocatalyst showed a much higher photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation than nondoped TiO2 after grafting with the cocatalyst of Fe3+. For the Ir:TiO2 photocatalyst, the two-step photoexcitation of an electron from the valence band to the conduction band through the Ir doping level occurred upon visible-light irradiation, as observed by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The two-step photoexcitation through the doping level was found to be a more stable process with a lower recombination rate of hole electron pairs than the two-step photoexcitation process through an oxygen vacancy. Once electrons are photoexcited to the conduction band by the two-step excitation, the electrons can easily transfer to the surface because the conduction band is a continuous electron path, whereas the electrons photoexcited at only the doping level could not easily transfer to the surface because of the discontinuity of this path. The observed two-step photoexcitation from the valence band to the conduction band through the doping level significantly contributes to the enhancement of the photocatalytic performance.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1089-5639			WOS:000408180000007	28738679

In this study, we synthesized hollow superstructures of crystallinity-controlled polyhedral skeletal-type copper sulfide (Cu7S4), which were integrated with cadmium sulfide (CdS) nanorods. The photocatalytic hydrogen production by water splitting was investigated under solar light irradiation with lactic acid as a hole scavenger. The Cu7S4/CdS composite exhibited a H-2 production rate of 6.25 mu mol h(-1), which was 3 times higher than that of CdS. Moreover, the addition of a small amount of nickel salts to the reaction solution significantly improved the activity of Cu7S4/CdS for H-2 production (45 mu mol h(-1)), which was 20 times higher than that of CdS and 7 times higher than that of Cu7S4/CdS. The enhancement of activity in Ni-Cu7S4/CdS (Cu7S4/CdS with Ni salts in the reaction solution) was attributed to the effective separation of charge carriers due to the unique properties of the skeletal-type Cu7S4 cages and the superior charge transportation of Ni salts in the reaction solution. The Cu7S4/CdS system containing Ni salts in the reaction solution is reported for photocatalytic hydrogen production for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, which promises new and inspiring research for the development of photocatalytic water splitting applications.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000540915300028

In this study, we cloned and sequenced four GST genes from the monogonont rotifer Brachionus koreanus. The domain regions of four Bk-GSTs showed a high similarity to those of other species. In addition, to evaluate the potential of GST genes as an early warning signal for oxidative stress, we exposed sublethal concentrations of copper (Cu) to B. koreanus and measured glutathione (GSH) contents and several antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx; EC 1.11.1.9), and glutathione reductase (GR; EC 1.8.1.7). The reactive oxygen species (ROS) at 12 h and 24 h after copper exposure increased significantly. GSH contents however did not increase significantly and even it decreased at 0.24 mg/L at 12 h. The activities of several antioxidant enzymes, particularly GPx and GR, showed a dramatic increase in 024 mg/L of CuCl2. Messenger RNAs of each Bk-GST showed different patterns of modulations according to GST types, and particularly, Bk-GST-omega, Bk-GST-sigma, and Bk-GST zeta genes were highly sensitive to Cu. These results indicate that Bk-GSTs, functioning as one of the enzymatic defense mechanisms particularly in the early stage of oxidative stress response, were induced by Cu exposure. This also suggests that these genes and related enzymes have a potential as biomarkers for a more sensitive initial stress response. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Although many active electrocatalysts have been used to electrocatalyze the N-2 reduction reaction (NRR), unsatisfactory NH3 yields and lower Faraday efficiency are still far from practical industrial production, and thus, considerable research efforts are being devoted to address these problems. Nevertheless, most reports still mainly focus on the preparation of electrocatalysts and largely ignore a summary of optimization-modification strategies for the NRR. In this review, a general introduction to the NRR mechanism is presented to provide a reasonable guide for the design of highly active catalysts. Then, four categories of NRR electrocatalysts, according to chemical compositions, are surveyed, as well as several strategies for promoting the catalytic activity and efficiency. Later, strategies for developing efficient N-2 fixation systems are discussed. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives in the context of the NRR are highlighted. This review sheds some light on the development of highly efficient catalytic systems for NH3 synthesis and stimulates research interests in the unexplored, but promising, research field of the NRR.									39	5	0	0	2	0	42			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000531664800001	32202392

Crystal structure, chemical component and surface valence states determined by XRD, XPS, TEM and SEM demonstrated the metastable cubic phase of perovskite NaNbO3, and its modified surface by Ru species. Optical and electrochemical analysis, such as UV-vis DRS, OTCS and EIS, indicated the excellent photoelectrochemical properties and the efficient electron transfer of the composites. Compared with naked and Ru-doped NaNbO3, the composite photocatalyst exhibited outstanding performance for the degradation of RhB under visible light irradiation due to the dye self-photosensitization and the surface interaction between Ru metal nanoparticles and semiconductor. In-situ reduction of surface Ru oxide species in the photocatalytic process assisted the further improvement of the photocatalytic activity and stability. Investigation of the main active species during the photocatalysis confirmed the efficient transfer of the photo-generated electrons and the positive effect of oxygen defects in NaNbO3. Finally, possible mechanism of the present visible-light driven photocatalysis was proposed in detail. This work provided an alternative strategy to enhance the visible-light photocatalytic efficiency of the catalyst with wide band gap on the basis of the synergistic effect of dye self-photosensitization, interaction between NaNbO3 and its surface Ru nanoparticles, and the "self-doping" of oxygen defects in NaNbO3.

With their peroxidase activity, they contribute to the homeostatic control of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and, therefore, participate in various physiological functions, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Although Prdxs have been shown to be potential biomarkers for monitoring aquatic environments, minimal scientific attention has been devoted to describing their molecular architecture and function in marine invertebrates. Our study aims to clarify the protective role against stress induced by exposure to metals (Cu, Zn, and Cd) of three Prdxs (Prdx2, Prdx3, and Prdx4) in the solitary ascidian Ciona robusta, an invertebrate chordate. Here, we report a detailed pre- and post-translational regulation of the three Prdx isoforms. Data on intestinal mRNA expression, provided by qRT-PCR analyses, show a generalized increase for Prdx2, -3, and -4, which is correlated to metal accumulation. Furthermore, the increase in tissue enzyme activity observed after Zn exposure is slower than that observed with Cu and Cd. The obtained results increase our knowledge of the evolution of anti-stress proteins in invertebrates and emphasize the importance of the synthesis of Prdxs as an efficient way to face adverse environmental conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2076-3921		WOS:000757313300001	35052596

Sulfur-bearing species as tracers of protoplanetary disk physics and chemistry: the DM Tau case								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				617						A28	10.1051/0004-6361/201832980				SEP 12 2018	2018	Context. Several sulfur-bearing molecules are observed in the interstellar medium and in comets, in strong contrast to protoplanetary disks where only CS, H2CS, and SO have been detected so far.Aims. We combine observations and chemical models to constrain the sulfur abundances and their sensitivity to physical and chemical conditions in the DM Tau protoplanetary disk.Methods. We obtained 0.5'' Atacama Large Millimeter Array observations of DM Tau in Bands 4 and 6 in lines of CS, SO, SO2, OCS, CCS, H2CS, and H2S, achieving a similar to 5 mJy sensitivity. Using the non-Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium radiative transfer code RADEX and the forward-modeling tool DiskFit, disk-averaged CS column densities and upper limits for the other species were derived.Results. Only CS was detected with a derived column density of similar to 2-6 x 10(12) cm(-2). We report a first tentative detection of SO2 in DM Tau. The upper limits range between similar to 10(11) and 10(14) cm(2) for the other S-bearing species. The best-fit chemical model matching these values requires a gas-phase C/O ratio of greater than or similar to 1 at r greater than or similar to 50-100 au. With chemical modeling we demonstrate that sulfur-bearing species could be robust tracers of the gas-phase C/O ratio, surface reaction rates, grain size and UV intensities.Conclusions. The lack of detections of a variety of sulfur-bearing molecules in DM Tau other than CS implies a dearth of reactive sulfur in the gas phase, either through efficient freeze-out or because most of the elemental sulfur is in other large species, as found in comets. The inferred high CS/SO and CS/SO2 ratios require a non-solar C/O gas-phase ratio of greater than or similar to 1, consistent with the recent observations of hydrocarbon rings in DM Tau. The stronger depletion of oxygen-bearing S-species compared to CS is likely linked to the low observed abundances of gaseous water in DM Tau and points to a removal mechanism of oxygen from the gas.									31	0	0	0	0	0	31			1432-0746			WOS:000444603600002

The oxygen isotope ratios of analyzed chondrules all plot very close to the primitive chondrule minerals (PCM) line. In each of 24 chondrules, the olivine and/or pyroxene grains analyzed show indistinguishable oxygen isotope ratios. Exceptions are minor occurrences of isotopically distinguished relict olivine grains, which were found in nine chondrules. The isotope homogeneity of these phenocrysts is consistent with a co-magmatic crystallization of olivine and pyroxene from the final chondrule melts and a significant oxygen isotope exchange between the ambient gas and the melts. Homogeneous type I chondrules with Mg#'s of 98.9-99.5 have host chondrule Delta O-17 values ranging from -6.0 parts per thousand to -4.1 parts per thousand, with one exception (Delta O-17: -1.2%; Mg#: 99.6). Homogeneous chondrules with Mg#'s <96, including four type II chondrules (Mg# -65-70), have Delta O-17 values of around -2.5%. Five type I chondrules (Mg# >= 99) have internally heterogeneous oxygen isotope ratios with (DO)-O-17 values ranging from -6.5 parts per thousand to -4.0 parts per thousand, similar to those of host chondrule values. These heterogeneous chondrules have granular or porphyritic textures, convoluted outlines, and contain numerous metal grains dispersed within fine-grained silicates. This is consistent with a low degree of melting of the chondrule precursors, possibly because of a low temperature of the melting event and/or a shorter duration of melting. The (DO)-O-17 values of relict olivine grains in nine chondrules range from -17.9% to -3.4%, while most of them overlap the range of the host chondrule values.Similar to those reported from multiple carbonaceous chondrites (Acfer 094, Y-82094, CO, and CV), the (DO)-O-17 similar to -5 parts per thousand and high Mg#(>= 99) chondrules, which might derive from a reduced reservoir with limited dust enrichments (similar to 50 x Solar System), dominate the population of chondrules in Murchison. Other chondrules in Murchison formed in more oxidizing environment (Mg# < 96) with higher (DO)-O-17 values of -2.5 parts per thousand, in agreement with the low Mg# chondrules in Acfer 094 and CO chondrites and some chondrules in CV and CR chondrites. They might form in environments containing the same anhydrous precursors as for the (DO)-O-17 similar to -5 parts per thousand and Mg# similar to 99 chondrules, but enriched in O-16-poor H2O ice (similar to 0.3-0.4 x the CI dust; (DO)-O-17 > 0 parts per thousand) and at dust enrichments of similar to 300-2000x.Regarding the Mg# and oxygen isotope ratios, the chondrule populations sampled by CM and CO chondrites are similar and indistinguishable. The similarity of these O-16-rich components in CO and CM chondrites is also supported by the common Fe/Mn ratio of olivine in type II chondrules. Although they accreted similar high-temperature silicates, CO chondrites are anhydrous compared to CM chondrites, suggesting they derived from different parent bodies formed inside and outside the snow line, respectively. If chondrules in CO and CM chondrites formed at the same disk locations but the CM parent body accreted later than the CO parent body, the snow line might have crossed the common chondrule-forming region towards the Sun between the time of the CO and CM parent bodies accretion.

However, under operating conditions, catalytically active bimetallic structures are often not stable and change their morphology which might reduce their functionality. Still, catalytically active structures do not necessarily need to be thermodynamically stable and might also be kinetically stabilized. Here we report kinetic Monte Carlo simulations based on density functional theory calculation to address the meta-stability of surface alloy systems. As structural changes can typically only occur via vacancy diffusion in the surface, we first determine the vacancy diffusion barrier as a function of their bimetallic environment. By determining the temporal evolution of the bimetallic surface alloys as a function of temperature, we analyze the factors underlying the stability and structure of the bimetallic surface alloys.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0301-0104	1873-4421		WOS:000754640400004

Noble-metal-based catalysts are used as electrode materials in water electrolyzers, but their high cost and low abundance have impeded them from being used in practical areas. Recently, metal sulfides and phosphides based on earth-abundant transition metals have emerged as promising candidates for efficient water-splitting catalysts. Most studies have focused on adjusting the composition of the metal sulfides and phosphides to enhance the catalytic performance. However, morphology control of catalysts, including faceted and hollow structures, is much less explored for these systems because of difficulties in the synthesis, which requires a deep understanding of the nanocrystal growth process. Herein, representative synthetic methods for morphology-controlled metal sulfides and phosphides are introduced to provide insights into these methodologies. The electrolytic performance of morphology-controlled metal sulfide- and phosphide-based nanocatalysts with enhanced surface area and intrinsically high catalytic activity is also summarized and the future research directions for this promising catalyst group is discussed.									323	18	0	0	7	0	324			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000467974100006	30706578

This is a semiarid region with seasonal precipitation in winter. Water chemistry generally evolves from Ca-HCO3 groundwater type close to the basin boundaries towards Ca-Mg-HCO3 groundwater type close to the Tanjero River along the axis of the basin. Some samples have increased concentrations of Na, Cl, and SO4 as a consequence of dissolution of halite and gypsum embedded in carbonates. Values of pH are slightly alkaline or alkaline, and redox parameters indicate a moderately reducing environment. Isotopes delta H-2 and delta O-18 indicate recharge from winter precipitation with no evaporation. Values of dissolved C-13(DIC) correspond to equilibrium with carbonates and C4 plants as the source of CO2. Values of Sr-87/Sr-86 in groundwater are in a good agreement with carbonate dissolution as a principal process. The principal geogenic contaminant is Ba with concentrations up to 0.383 mg/L. Dissolved concentrations of other geogenic contaminants such as As, F, Mn, and Cr are low or below the detection limit as expected based on their low contents in carbonate rocks. Inverse geochemical modeling on selected profiles calibrated using delta C-13 values provided mass transfer coefficients for possible geochemical reactions. Future work should focus on interactions in the hyporheic zone of the Tanjero River.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0167-6369	1573-2959		WOS:000780945400003	35403925

Here a simple, large-scale synthesis of centimeter-long 1D carbon nitride (CN) needles with tunable photophysical, electric, and catalytic properties is reported. Successful growth of ultralong needles is acquired by the utilization of 1D organic crystal precursors comprised of CN monomers as reactants. Upon calcination at high temperatures, the shape of the starting crystal is fully preserved while the CN composition and porosity, and optical and electrical properties can be easily tuned by tailoring the starting elements ratio and final calcination temperature. The facile manipulation and visualization of the CN needles endow their direct electrical measurements by placing them between two conductive probes. Moreover, the CN needles exhibit good photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production owing to their improved light harvesting properties, high surface area, and advantageous energy bands position. The new growth strategy developed here may open opportunities for a rational design of CN and other metal-free materials with controllable directionality and tunable photophysical and electronic properties, toward their utilization in (photo)electronic devices.									53	2	0	0	4	0	53			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000434173300027	29682900	
J	Shao, Can; Guan, Bin; Lin, Baiyang; Gu, Hao; Gu, Chen; Li, Zhongzhao; Lin, He; Huang, Zhen								Effect of methane doping on nascent soot formation in ethylene-based laminar premixed flames								FUEL				186				422	429		10.1016/j.fuel.2016.08.081				DEC 15 2016	2016	The impact of methane doping on sooting behavior of ethylene-base burner stabilized stagnation (BSS) flames was investigated by following the evolution of particle size distribution functions (PSDFs) of nascent soot. The M-series of flames with the equivalence ratio of 2.07 was doped by methane with the mixture ratio of 5%, 10% and 40%. All the methane-doping flames showed obvious bimodality in the PSDFs, and more particles in nucleation stage than the C3 reference flame. The synergistic effect appeared in small ratio (5% and 10%) methane doping cases, leading to the increase of the soot number density and soot mobility volume fractions. While the synergistic effect was not found under large methane doping condition (40%), in which the mobility volume fraction was less than that in C3 flame. By calculating the key species and analyzing the reaction pathways of pyrene formation with KM2-Mech, we found that small ratio of methane doping benefits C3H3 and pyrene (A4) formation, which strengthened the sooting tendency. However too much methane doping reduced the yield of C2H2 that is a critical intermediate of PAHs formation, leading to a lower sooting tendency compared with the pure ethylene flame.

J	Morse, JW; Mackenzie, FT								Hadean ocean carbonate geochemistry								AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY				4	3-4			301	319		10.1023/A:1009632230875				1998	1998	Relatively soon (similar to 0.2 Ga) after the Earth formed, it is likely that major oceans appeared in a hot (similar to 100 degrees C) reducing environment where carbon dioxide was probably the dominant atmospheric gas, with P-CO2 values reaching perhaps in excess of 10 atm. During the Hadean Eon between 4.3 and 3.8 Ga BP, major changes in the concentration of atmospheric CO2 and associated temperature changes had a profound influence on the carbonate geochemistry of the Hadean Ocean. Although no rocks are known to have survived prior to the Archean Eon, it is still possible to calculate approximate values for important seawater parameters during the Hadean Eon based on other sources of information and reasonable assumptions about processes such as weathering reactions.Our calculations are based on a linear temperature change from 100 degrees C to 70 degrees C and log P-CO2 change from 1 to -1.5 over the Hadean Eon. Over this range in temperature and P-CO2, the influence of T is relatively small, but changes in P-CO2 result in large compositional variations in the carbonate chemistry of Hadean seawater. In the early Hadean, seawater pH was probably about 5.8+/- similar to 0.2, DIC may have reached close to 130 mM, and alkalinity was perhaps close to 30 mM. By the late Hadean, seawater pH probably had changed to close to neutral (similar to 6.8), and DIC and alkalinity were closer to present-day values. Even large uncertainties in Na+ + Cl-, K+ and Mg2+ concentrations produce relatively small uncertainties in our calculated values for the carbonic acid system. However, larger uncertainties result from reasonable ranges for Ca2+ concentrations and the saturation state of Hadean seawater with respect to calcite.Our calculations support the hypothesis that a carbonate chemistry of seawater roughly similar to that of modern oceans could have been acquired very early in Earth history. If seawater composition were buffered by reactions involving carbonates and silicates, then the composition of late Hadean-early Archean seawater was not vastly different from that of today. Thus, by the conclusion of the Hadean Eon, if not before, environmental conditions at the Earth's surface, including temperature and seawater composition, were sufficiently equable for the evolution of life, including the Archaebacteria: the extreme halophiles and thermophiles and methanogens. Contrary to the hypothesis of an early Na-bicarbonate ocean, our calculations suggest the possibility that the early oceans of Earth were a NaCl-dominated aqueous solution, with somewhat higher DIC and alkalinity concentrations, higher saturation state, and the possibility of lower calcium concentrations. The time course of approach of Hadean seawater to a carbonate composition closer to that of today is difficult to predict. It is distinctly possible that the concentration of calcium in seawater did not reach levels like that of modern seawater until the late Precambrian and thus constrained the timing of the "Big Bang" of organic evolution, the emergence of the shelled invertebrates at the beginning of the Phanerozoic.									86	4	0	0	41	0	90			1380-6165	1573-1421		WOS:000082329100002

Herein, novel 2D-COFs with C, N and H elements confined to the quadrilateral-pore skeleton based on first-principles calculations and the topological assembly of different benzene-based building blocks were designed and studied. These 2D-COFs enriched the topology types and can offer an ideal platform for band engineering aimed at spontaneously driving the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under visible light irradiation. The approach for regulating pore structures on nodes, linkers and linkages can effectively tune band gaps, and thus the 2D-COF, consisting of benzene building blocks and imine linkages, has the optimal activity for the photocatalytic HER under common visible light conditions. Furthermore, the integrated p(z)-orbital population was found to evaluate the photocatalytic activity efficiently. We demonstrate that the p(z)-orbital population is in linear relationship with the intensity of H+ adsorption, indicating that the total contribution of the p(z)-orbital electrons can be an efficient descriptor for screening suitable 2D-COF structures for use as photocatalysts for the HER. Therefore, this work presents a new strategy for designing novel quadrilateral-pore 2D-COFs as visible-light photocatalysts and provides an important insight into the relationship between catalytic activity and the population of activated electrons.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000859226900001	36156669

In this study, a one-dimensional (1D) model of fuel cell cathode catalytic layer (CCL) is proposed to investigate the structural evolution, electrochemical surface area (ECSA), Pt and Co loss of Pt-Co shell-core structured catalysts, and then the aging mechanism of catalyst is elaborated by simulation. The model considers three main processes: (1) oxidation and redeposition of Pt on the Pt shell; (2) crossover H-2 through the membrane to reduce Pt2+ near the CCL/membrane interface; and (3) leaching and dissolution of Co. The results show that the severe dissolution of catalyst particles near the CCL/membrane interface not only leads to a large loss of Pt and Co, but also causes the catalyst to age unevenly along the CCL thickness direction. In addition, both the increase in temperature and the decrease in the average particle size accelerate the catalyst aging.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000804869500001

The plasma was generated with repetitive positive pulses (7-10 kV, 800 ns, and 1 kHz). We investigated (i).the dependence of OH density on various discharge parameters, (ii).the production and loss processes of OH radicals, and (iii).the effect of O-2 admixture on OH density with the help of simulations. The simulations included only postdischarge reactions. To simulate the discharge pulse, the increase in the OH density in a discharge pulse measured using LIF was used as an input parameter. The results suggested that the OH density at any position in the plasma was approximately proportional to epsilon(0.5)(d) f(0.4) regardless of the H2O concentration, where epsilon(d) is the discharge energy density at the position and f is the pulse repetition frequency. The results also suggested that OH was mainly produced by H2O+ + e -> OH + H rather than H2O + e -> OH + H + e, where H2O+ was produced by Penning ionization, and its main loss processes were H + OH + M -> H2O + M and OH + OH + M -> H2O2 + M.									8	2	0	0	0	0	8			0963-0252	1361-6595		WOS:000521956500001

In this study, we investigated the ability of a set of structurally related recombinant bacterial adenylate forming enzymes derived from nonribosomal peptide synthetases for their ability to synthesize acyl-CoAs in vitro. Adenylation-domains normally transfer their reactive aminoacyl-adenylates onto the covalently attached 4'-phosphopantetheine moiety of small carrier proteins. In detail, DltA, DhbE, GrsA-A, TycB(3)-A, and TycC(3)-A were investigated for their ability to synthesize acyl-CoAs. As reference, acetyl-CoA-synthetase (Acs) of B. subtilis was utilized, which naturally synthesizes acetyl-CoA from acetate, CoA-SH and ATP. Interestingly, all enzymes were capable of producing acyl-CoAs, albeit with differing efficiencies. Surprisingly, both CoA-SH and ATP were observed to inhibit the adenylation reaction at higher concentrations. Product quantification for kinetic determination was carried out by ESI-SIM-NIS. Our results allow speculation as to evolutionary relationships within the large class of adenylate forming enzymes. (c) 2007 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Karavaev, VA; Solntsev, MK; Yurina, TP; Yurina, EV; Polyakova, IB; Kuznetsov, AM								Antifungal activity of aqueous extracts of the leaves of cowparsnip andcomfrey								BIOLOGY BULLETIN				28	4			365	370		10.1023/A:1016671007118				JUL-AUG 2001	2001	We found that extracts from the leaves of medicinal comfrey and cowparsnip strongly inhibit the germination of Erysiphe graminis conidia and uredospores of Puccinia graminis. Spraying wheat seedlings with these extracts, in contrast to the irrigation of soil, markedly diminished infection in plants with powdery mildew. Antifungal activity in vitro and protective activity (when plants were sprayed) correlated with the level of phenolic compounds in these extracts. Experiments with healthy plants have demonstrated that the photosynthetic apparatus of wheat plants is stimulated by extracts. Spraying seedlings with the extracts resulted in an increased rate of O-2 evolution calculated per unit of chlorophyll, an increase in the ratio (F-M - F-T)/F-T in the experiments that recorded slow fluorescence induction, an increase in the relative light intensity of band A, and a decrease of relative intensity of band C in experiments with thermoluminescence of wheat leaves. These results provide evidence that the protective activity of comfrey and cowparsnip extracts is associated with their action on the pathogenic fungus and with the activation of natural defense reactions of the host plant.									4	3	1	0	2	2	10			1062-3590	1608-3059		WOS:000174231000008

Wulund, Lisa/O-6485-2014	Wulund, Lisa/0000-0002-7584-2945			Rethinking the clockwork: redox cycles and non-transcriptional control of circadian rhythms								BIOCHEMICAL SOCIETY TRANSACTIONS				42				1	10		10.1042/BST20130169				FEB 2014	2014	Circadian rhythms are a hallmark of living organisms, observable in all walks of life from primitive bacteria to highly complex humans. They are believed to have evolved to coordinate the timing of biological and behavioural processes to the changing environmental needs brought on by the progression of day and night through the 24-h cycle. Most of the modern study of circadian rhythms has centred on so-called TTFLs (transcription-translation feedback loops), wherein a core group of 'clock' genes, capable of negatively regulating themselves, produce oscillations with a period of approximately 24 h. Recently, however, the prevalence of the TTFL paradigm has been challenged by a series of findings wherein circadian rhythms, in the form of redox reactions, persist in the absence of transcriptional cycles. We have found that circadian cycles of oxidation and reduction are conserved across all domains of life, strongly suggesting that non-TTFL mechanisms work in parallel with the canonical genetic processes of timekeeping to generate the cyclical cellular and behavioural phenotypes that we commonly recognize as circadian rhythms.									14	0	1	0	11	0	15			0300-5127	1470-8752		WOS:000333444400001	24450621

Co2P was synthesized from red phosphorus and cobalt nitrate to increase the photocatalytic activity of MoS2. Co2P was loaded onto the surface of MoS2, and the photo-catalytic activity (9.15 mmol g(-1) h(-1)) was three times that of MoS2 (3.14 mmol g(-1) h(-1)), which was twice times that of Co2P (4.60 mmol g(-1) h(-1)). Characterization by fluorescence and electrochemistry indicates that the composite photocatalyst improves the efficiency of photo-generated charge separation. Composite catalyst described by the BET specific surface area greater can provide more active sites. Therefore, after loading Co2P, the photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency of MoS2 can be effectively improved.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000489644800043		
J	He, J; Tse, JS; Klug, DD; Preston, KF								Layered polysilane: thermolysis and photoluminescence								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY				8	3			705	710		10.1039/a703992a				MAR 1998	1998	Layered polysilane (Si6H6) and its thermolysis have been studied using FTIR spectroscopy, thermogravimetry/differential thermal analysis, mass spectrometry, electron paramagnetic resonance, Si K-edge absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy. It is found that cross-linking between (-Si6H6-)(n) layers occurs through dehydrocoupling reactions when the layered polysilane is heated under vacuum or an inert atmosphere at temperatures of 100-200 degrees C. Structural changes in the silicon network are evident during thermolysis: the layered structure of polysilane starts to collapse at 200 degrees C and is transformed to amorphous hydrogenated silicon and subsequently to crystalline silicon (c-Si) at temperatures higher than 450 degrees C. This process is accompanied by the evolution of H-2 and SiH4 gases. The resulting layered polysilane exhibits strong room temperature photoluminescence at 560 nm (ca. 2.2 eV) and a blue-shift of Si K-edge absorption (0.6 eV) relative to c-Si. Annealing the layered polysilane results in red-shifts of luminescence peak energy with the increase of annealing temperature, consistent with the trend observed in the Si K-edge absorption measurement. These results are interpreted in terms of the growth of silicon network dimension during the thermolysis. The reduction in visible luminescence intensity for the annealed product at 300 degrees C (or higher) is further attributed to the creation of defects, e.g., silicon dangling bonds (g = 2.0047) which provide pathways for non-radiative recombination. The relationship between layered polysilane (as well as its annealed products) and porous Si is discussed.									35	0	0	0	1	1	35			0959-9428			WOS:000072479400036		
J	Ritossa, C; GarciaBerro, E; Iben, I				Garcia-Berro, Enrique/C-8034-2014				On the evolution of stars that form electron-degenerate cores processed by carbon burning .2. Isotope abundances and thermal pulses in a 10 M circle dot model with an ONe core and applications to long-period variables, classical novae, and accretion-induced collapse								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				460	1			489	505		10.1086/176987				MAR 20 1996	1996	A 10 M(.) model of Population I composition is evolved from the hydrogen-burning main sequence to the thermally pulsing ''super''-asymptotic giant branch (TPSAGB) stage, where it has an oxygen-neon (ONe) core of mass 1.196 M(.) and is experiencing thermal pulses driven by helium-burning thermonuclear hashes. Interior abundance characteristics are relevant to an understanding of the core collapse of massive accreting white dwarfs in close binary star systems. At mass point 0.2 M(.), abundances by mass are X(O-16) = 0.656, X(Ne-20) = 0.215, X(Na-23) = 0.0467, X(Mg-24) = 0.0325, X(Mg-25) = 0.0115, X(C-12) = 0.0112, X(Ne-22) = 0.00893, X(Ne-21) = 0.00689, X(Mg-26) = 0.00560 and X(Al-27) = 0.00528. Abundances near the surface of the core are relevant to an understanding of nova outbursts in cataclysmic variables. At mass point 1.17 M(.), abundances by mass are X(O-16) = 0.511, X(Ne-20) = 0.313, X(Na-23) = 0.0644, X(Mg-24) = 0.0548, X(Mg-25) = 0.0158, X(Al-27) = 0.0108, X(C-12) = 0.00916, X(Mg-26) = 0.00989, X(Ne-21) = 0.00598, and X(Ne-22) = 0.00431. Carbon burning is quenched at the beginning of the thermally pulsing phase, and a layer of CO matter of mass similar to 0.015 M(.) separates the ONe core from overlying helium- and hydrogen-rich layers. The outer 0.01 M(.) of the CO layer contains essentially no neon: very little new Ne-20 has been made, and most of the Ne-22 which has been made from the original CNO elements has been converted into Mg-25 and neutrons which have been captured to form neutron-rich isotopes. If the observational counterpart of the model is in a close binary and fills its Roche lobe near the end of the carbon-burning phase, and if the binary evolves into a cataclysmic variable, one expects that the ejecta of approximately 1000 nova outbursts will exhibit an underabundance of neon and overabundance of carbon oxygen, and magnesium.During the TPSAGB phase, characteristics of a pulse cycle approach local limit-cycle values after similar to 30 pulses. Helium-shell flashes are of about the same strength (L(He)(max) similar to 3 x 10(6) L(.), L(He)(min) similar to 100 L(.)) as in AGB models with CO cores of mass similar to 1 M(.), but the time between flashes (similar to 200 yr) and the mass of helium fuel built up between hashes (similar to 1.3 x 10(-4) M(.)) are much smaller. The amount of energy released in a flash is not enough to propel matter at the hydrogen-helium discontinuity far enough outward that associated cooling extinguishes hydrogen burning (L(H)(min) similar to 10(2) L(.) L(H)(max) similar to 6 x 10(4) L(.)). The temperature at the base of the convective shell forced by helium burning attains a maximum of T-CSB(max) similar to 360 x 10(6) K. Depending on the choice of cross section for the Ne-22(alpha, n)Mg-25 reaction, 50%-80% the Ne-22 initially in the convective shell is converted into Mg-25, providing 20-30 neutrons for every Fe-56 seed nucleus. The neutron density (similar to 6 x 10(12) cm(-3)) is presumably much larger than is appropriate for producing s-process isotopes in the solar system distribution at critical branch points. During pulse powerdown, at least 7% and perhaps as much as 30% of the matter which has been in the convective shell is dredged up into the convective envelope. Thus, an observational counterpart of the model may exhibit an enhancement of heavy s-process isotopes in a nonsolar distribution and Mg isotopes in a distinctly nonsolar distribution, but because of the large mass of the convective envelope, these anomalies may not be detectable in a typical TPSAGB star. The abundance of Li relative to H in a model may be much larger or much smaller than Li/H similar to 10(-10) depending on the treatment of convection and on where the model is in the TPSAGB phase. At the beginning of the TPSAGB phase, the surface abundances by number of CNO elements are in the ratio (C:N:O) = (2.4:4.3:6.3), compared with the initial ratios (C:N:O) = (3.6:1.0:8.0). During the TPSAGB phase, the ratio of C to N decreases, and the ratio of C-12 to C-13 decreases from similar to 25 to similar to 4. a test of these predictions involves abundance estimates of the brightest long-period variables in the Galaxy and in the Magellanic Clouds. Perhaps the major signature of a TPSAGB star is a brightness greater than the ''classical limit'' of M(bol) = -7.1. Betelgeuse in our Galaxy and four stars in the Magellanic Clouds are brighter than the supposed limit, but they exhibit abundance characteristics which can be accounted for in the framework of TPSAGB theory. Assuming that a superwind removes mass from the surface at a rate of similar to 10(-4) M(.) yr(-1), the final mass of the ONe white dwarf formed by our TPSAGB model is similar to 1.26 M(.), the outer 0.06 M(.) of which is composed primarily of carbon and oxygen.									179	0	0	0	0	0	179			0004-637X			WOS:A1996TZ36600041

The presented study attempts to identify contamination sources affecting water quality within the Kozlowa Gora reservoir catchment area (southern Poland). A total of 100 water samples were collected from surface water (the Brynica river, streams, and the reservoir) and groundwater (a Quarternary aquifer) in four time periods. During fieldwork, the physicochemical parameters were measured (temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, redox potential, and dissolved oxygen). The chemical analysis included the determination of major ions (HCO3-, SO42-, Cl-, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and K+), nutrients (NO3-, NO2-, NH4+, and PO43-), and total organic carbon. The study was complemented by isotopic analysis of sulphur and oxygen in sulphate, which enabled a more precise identification of stressors affecting water quality in different parts of the catchment area. Chemical and isotopic results (delta S-34 = 4.38-13.99 parts per thousand; delta O-18 3.59-13.30 parts per thousand) revealed that wastewater discharges and agricultural activities have a significant influence on the chemistry of the Brynica River and other streams. At some sampling points, a lower quality of water was manifested by elevated concentrations of NO3- (up to 22.6 mg/L) and several other ions (e.g., up to 114 mg/L for Cl-, up to 51.52 mg/L for NH4+, and 12.5 mg/L for PO43-). The quality of groundwater was deteriorated mainly by infiltration of sewage from leaky septic tanks. The level of groundwater contamination varied depending on the location, as higher concentrations of major ions and values of electrical conductivity were observed in residential areas. The Brynica river, streams, and groundwater recharge the drinking water reservoir, and thus its quality depends on these sources. A dilution of water and the presence of biochemical processes led to a reduction of contaminant concentrations in the Kozlowa Gora reservoir (down to 3.5 mg/L for NO3-, 32 mg/L for Cl-, 0.21 mg/L for NH4+, and <0.05 mg/L for PO43-) compared to water in the river and streams supplying the reservoir. The study revealed the role of wastewater discharge and agricultural activities in the evolution of surface water chemistry. The results will be used in further research on the origin and migration of other substances in water, including microcontaminants.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4441		WOS:000774587800001

We find that the UiOS-Cu, as an efficient medium for the separation and transfer of charge carriers between CdS and ZnS, successfully transforms the I-type transfer mechanism of charge carriers in CdS/ZnS heterojunction into II-type transfer mechanism, in which the decoration of Cu (II) plays a key role. Due to the decoration of Cu (II), the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of UiOS-Cu is markedly lifted to the position higher than the valence band (VB) of CdS, promoting the smooth transfer of photoinduced holes from the VB of CdS to the HOMO of UiOS-Cu. Thanks to this II-type transfer mechanism, the photogenerated electrons and holes are effectively separated and transferred, significantly improving the photocatalytic H2 evolution performance. The optimized SCu-CZS sample exhibits a high H2 generation rate of 425.5 mu mol/h (10 mg of catalyst) with an apparent quantum efficiency of 24.6% at the wavelength of 365 nm in the absence of noble metal co-catalyst. This work indicates that MOF can be used as an efficient transfer medium of charge carriers, promoting photocatalytic hydrogen evolution by transforming the transfer mechanism of photogenerated electrons and holes, which provides a new idea for the construction of MOF-based photocatalysts.									42	2	0	0	4	0	42			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000607216500004

Conjugated polymer nanostructures (CPNs), with highly pi-conjugated structures, have been demonstrated as a new class of photocatalysts. However, pristine CPNs show poor photocatalytic activity for hydrogen generation owing to fast charge carrier recombination and sluggish kinetics. The investigation of application of polypyrrole in photocatalytic hydrogen generation is also rare. Here, we report the surface modification of polypyrrole nanostructures (NSs) with Pt- and Ni-based nanoparticles for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. PPy nanostructures (NSs) were synthesized using lamellar mesophases as soft templates. The PPy-NSs were modified with mono- and bimetallic (Pt, Ni, Pt-Ni) co-catalyst nanoparticles induced by radiolysis. The prepared Pt-PPy, Ni-PPy and PtNi-PPy exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity for H-2 generation and a synergistic effect is obtained with co-modification with Pt and Ni. The effects of the nature of the metal precursors and the loading ratio were studied. We show that the loading rate of co-catalysts is crucial for H-2 generation, and an excess of co-catalyst can drastically decrease the activity. The composite photocatalyst Pt-Ni-PPy nanostructures are very active and stable with cycling. Our results indicate that modified CPNs with mono- and bimetallic NPs are promising photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution.									34	0	0	0	7	0	34			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000503772400023

Olignucleotide-directed mutagenesis has been used to introduce mutations into a segment of the psbB gene which encodes the large extrinsic loop E of CP47 in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. One mutation, R448G, produced a strain with impaired photosystem II activity. When grown in standard BG-11 media (480 mu M chloride), this strain grew photoautotrophically at about 50% the rate of control strains and exhibited 63% of the control photosystem II activity. Quantum yield measurement at low light intensities indicated that this mutant had 55% of the fully functional photosystem II centers contained in control strains of Synechocystis. Upon exposure to high light intensities, the mutant strain exhibited a 2.2-fold increase in the rate of photoinactivation. When grown in BG-11 which was depleted in chloride (20 mu M chloride), the mutant strain exhibited dramatically altered characteristics. Little or no growth was observed in the mutant while the control strains grew at nearly normal rates. Growth rates of the mutant strain could be restored by the addition of 480 mu M bromide to the chloride-deficient BG-11 media. In the presence of glucose, the mutant and control strains grew at comparable rates under either chloride-sufficient or chloride-limiting conditions. Analysis of the mutant cell line grown in the absence of chloride and in the presence of glucose indicated that it exhibited essentially no capacity for oxygen evolution. [C-14]Atrazine binding experiments indicated that the mutant assembled 75% fewer photosystem II centers than it is capable of assembling in the presence of chloride. Immunological analysis of a number of photosystem II proteins in this mutant indicated that CP43 and the 33-kDa extrinsic manganese-stabilizing protein were present in normal quantities but that CP47 and D1 were present in significantly lower amounts. These results indicate that the mutation R448G in the CP47 protein affects photosystem II assembly and/or stability under chloride-limiting conditions. This is the first mutant identified in any system which exhibits an altered chloride requirement for photosystem II.									34	0	0	0	27	0	34			0006-2960			WOS:A1994PF19000026	8075078

The as-obtained nano-worms were similar to 3-6 nm in width and similar to 12-20 nm in length. Their time dependent growth evolution was studied via transmission electron microscopy and coupled with our observations from the XRD analysis a growth-morphology-mechanism was proposed. The as-obtained BiVO4 nanoparticles were deposited on an ITO coated glass substrate and the resultant films were investigated for efficiency in photoelectrochemical water splitting. The BiVO4 nanoworms outperformed all the other BiVO4 structures obtained at different times of growth evolution by having both the highest anodic photocurrent densities and the lowest onset potential. Subsequent EIS and Mott-Schottky analysis revealed comparatively low interfacial charge transfer resistance and a cathodic shift in the flat band potential of the nanoworms led to their better photoelectrochemical performance. Our analysis indicates that a decrease in resistive photoelectron trapping surface states associated with the BiVO4 nanoworms leads to their excellent photoelectrochemical activity.									40	0	0	0	2	0	40			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000489345300015

Molecular and structural antioxidant defenses against oxidative stress in animals. Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 301: R843-R863, 2011. First published July 20, 2011; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00034.2011.-In this review, it is our aim 1) to describe the high diversity in molecular and structural antioxidant defenses against oxidative stress in animals, 2) to extend the traditional concept of antioxidant to other structural and functional factors affecting the "whole" organism, 3) to incorporate, when supportable by evidence, mechanisms into models of life-history trade-offs and maternal/epigenetic inheritance, 4) to highlight the importance of studying the biochemical integration of redox systems, and 5) to discuss the link between maximum life span and antioxidant defenses. The traditional concept of antioxidant defenses emphasizes the importance of the chemical nature of molecules with antioxidant properties. Research in the past 20 years shows that animals have also evolved a high diversity in structural defenses that should be incorporated in research on antioxidant responses to reactive species. Although there is a high diversity in antioxidant defenses, many of them are evolutionary conserved across animal taxa. In particular, enzymatic defenses and heat shock response mediated by proteins show a low degree of variation. Importantly, activation of an antioxidant response may be also energetically and nutrient demanding. So knowledge of antioxidant mechanisms could allow us to identify and to quantify any underlying costs, which can help explain life-history trade-offs. Moreover, the study of inheritance mechanisms of antioxidant mechanisms has clear potential to evaluate the contribution of epigenetic mechanisms to stress response phenotype variation.									224	9	1	0	199	1	236			0363-6119	1522-1490		WOS:000295881600001	21775650	
J	Ikeda, Shigeru								Copper-based kesterite thin films for photoelectrochemical water splitting								HIGH TEMPERATURE MATERIALS AND PROCESSES				40	1			446	460		10.1515/htmp-2021-0050				DEC 31 2021	2021	Copper kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 is a promising photoabsorber material for solar cells and photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. In this article, we will first review the crystallographic/energetic structures of Cu2ZnSnS4 in view of its applications to sunlight conversion devices. Then, historical progress in photovoltaic properties of Cu2ZnSnS4-based solar cells is introduced. Finally, studies on PEC H-2 evolution over Cu2ZnSnS4-based photocathodes are reviewed in detail. For realizing efficient PEC H-2 evolution, surface modifications with an n-type buffer layer (such as CdS) and a catalytic site (such as Pt nanoparticles) were found to be indispensable. Since these surface-modified photocathodes had poor resistances under an operating bias due to the occurrence of oxidative photocorrosion of the CdS layer and elimination of the Pt catalysts, coverage with a protection layer was required to improve the long-term durability. Moreover, partial or complete substitution of the constituent cations with some cations was proved to be effective for improving PEC properties. Although recent studies showed a rapid increase in PEC properties, there is room for further development of PEC properties by using effective combinations among surface protection(s), defect engineering(s), and band engineering(s).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0334-6455	2191-0324		WOS:000742840300001

Efficient and visible light driven CdO-WO3 composites with versatile properties have been fabricated through hydrothermal approach for H-2 evolution. X-ray diffractometer, scanning electron microscope, UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, photo-luminescence emission spectroscopy and photocatalytic activity test were employed to investigate different properties like crystallography, morphology, optical and photocatalytic properties. The effect of CdO concentration on the grain size indicated the reduction of bad gap energy of the WO3. The concentration of CdO nanoparticles in WO3 directly effect on the morphology of the particles that are in the form of nanorods. The atoms of CdO makes the WO3 nanoparticles more effective and efficient up to 4% of CdO but when coupling amount increases then the CdO-WO3 nanoparticles exhibited less photocatalytic performance to evolve H-2 energy. Results shown that 4% content in WO3 had exceptional photocatalytic activity for water splitting when compared to other samples. The improved hydrogen production was allied with formation of active Cd species during the photocatalysis process, which has the ability to promote the interfacial charge-separation and concurrently may cause to reduce the over potential of hydrogen evolution, thus boosting the photocatalytic activity over the hybrid sample. The improved photocatalytic activity of composites could be accredited to extended absorption region of visible light, efficient separation of charge carrier's and suppress recombination of electron-hole pairs. The current work not only shows a prospect for the utilization of low cost CdO as a co-catalyst in photocatalytic hydrogen generation but also shows a substantial enhancement in H-2 evolution, first time, using CdO-WO3 hybrid photocatalyst.

Photocatalytic water splitting to hydrogen is a potential technology to achieve this challenge goal, but the process is still far from industrial application due to the weak activities of the fabricated catalysts of wide bandgap energies. Here, novel 1D CoBiTi layered double hydroxide (CBT-LDH) with a bandgap of 2.4 eV has been synthesized by a facile route and achieved hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of 272.8 mu molg(-1)h(-1) without scavengers. Due to doping with highly active Bi, 2D CoBiTi layered double oxide (CBTO) with high infrared (IR)-responsivity (bandgap = 1.27 eV) has been made by drying 1D CBT-LDH at 150 ?, which can achieve 113 mu molg(-1)h(-1) in the presence of a scavenger. However, in-situ compositing CBT-LDH and CBTO can fabricate novel 3D-heterojunction and duplicate the HER by 5 folds (~1255 mu molg(-1)h(-1)) under Xenon light irradiation. The novel 3D-heterojunction can effectively quench the recombination of the photoexcited species by the functional groups from CBT-LDH and cause a strong synergy between the visible and IR irradiation as a promising route for industrial hydrogen production.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0959-6526	1879-1786		WOS:000773065400001

All doped compositions of LaFeO3 were synthesised by sol-gel method. Structural studies show the formation of secondary oxide phases when calcined at 800 degrees C and phase pure compounds when calcined at 1100 degrees C. Optical studies reveal the capability of these perovskites to be visible light active and indicate that the bandgaps become narrower after doping alkaline earth elements. Photocatalytic activity was tested through Congo Red (CR) dye degradation studies and hydrogen evolution through water splitting. The results indicate that Mg doped LaFeO3 composite which was obtained after the calcination at 800 degrees C shows higher hydrogen evolution rate and the highest rate of Congo red (CR) dye degradation among all synthesised compositions of undoped and doped LaFeO3 under natural Xenon lamp irradiation. The possible mechanism of the photocatalytic activity is also proposed in this study.									22	1	0	0	5	0	22			0022-3697	1879-2553		WOS:000517658100026

The characterization results proved that Cu3P nanoparticles with high purity and good crystallinity were uniformly embedded on the g-C3N4 nanosheets. The maximal H-2 evolution rate can be enhanced to 4909.9 mol . g(-1) . h(-1), which is 71.1 times higher than bare g-C3N4. The markedly photocatalytic H-2 production was mainly because of increased active sites and the intimate contact interfaces by in situ growth of Cu3P nanoparticles on g-C3N4 nanosheets, which greatly boost the separation and transport of photo-induced electro-hole pairs. The enhanced mechanism was proposed and verified by the photoluminescence spectra, transient photocurrent responses and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results. This one-step solvothermal synthesis paves a new way for in situ construction of highly efficient transition metal phosphides/carbon nitride photocatalyst and application of photocatalytic splitting water system.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000484239100002

Its compositions, especially its Ir content, have significant impacts on the electrochemical stability, activity, and cost of the electrode. In this paper, the effects of Ir content on the electrochemical stability and activity of the Ti/IrO2-SnO2-Sb2O5 electrodes were investigated. Experimental results show that the electrochemical stability initially increased with nominal Ir content until 10 mol%. From 10-30 mol%, the effect of Ir composition gives insignificant difference. Further increase in Ir content beyond 30 mol% resulted in a decrease in the electrochemical stability. The performance of the electrode depends on all the steps it was made with about 15 % variation observed at Ir content of 20 mol%, where the longest average accelerated service life was found to be 1063 h under the conditions of anodic current density of 10 000 A/m(2) in 3 mol/L H2SO4 electrolyte at 70 degrees C. The study on electrode degradation and failure mechanism reveals that the development of cracks or pores in the coating surface, the loss of Sb and Ir contents, and crystalline structure change of the coating during the life test facilitated the deactivation of the electrode. Moreover, the non-conductive TiO2 interlayer formation was found to be responsible for the peeling of the coating layer, leading to the failure of Ti/IrO2-SnO2-Sb2O5, especially with high Ir content (> 30 mol% in nominal).									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0008-4034	1939-019X		WOS:000458447500015

Herein we have designed an innovative, non-heavy-metal-based hybrid photocatalyst via in-situ decoration of ZnS nanoparticles with Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets toward enhanced photocatalytic H-2 production. The incorporation of Ti3C2 essentially promotes the charge transfer and extends the lifetime of photo-induced carriers, thereby resulting in an augmented H(2 )production yield of 502.6 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) under optimal conditions, being almost 4-fold higher than pure ZnS (124.6 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)). Thus, this work has demonstrated ZnS/MXene photocatalytic as a promising candidate for hydrogen generation to boost the entire clean energy system and provided a new insight into further broadening the water splitting application of MXene-based materials.

Our analysis is based on both the "classical'' one-dimensional stellar atmosphere models and on the new generation of three-dimensional hydrodynamic models. The NLTE calculations presented here have been carried out without inelastic collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms. We find that if NLTE effects are taken into account when synthesizing the Fe I spectrum in both types of atmospheric models, then the derived iron abundance turns out to be very similar in both cases. The emergent spectral line profiles in both models are very much weaker in NLTE than in LTE because the UV overionization mechanism produces a very strong underpopulation of the Fe I levels, in particular in the granular regions of the three-dimensional model. As a result, the NLTE effects on the derived iron abundance are very important, amounting to similar to0.9 and to similar to0.6 dex in the three- and one-dimensional cases, respectively. On the other hand, we find that NLTE and three- dimensional effects have to be taken into account for a reliable determination of the iron abundance from weak Fe II lines, because the significant over-excitation of their upper levels in the granular regions tend to produce emission features. As a result, such Fe II lines are weaker than in LTE and the abundance correction amounts to similar to0.4 dex for the three- dimensional case. We also derive the oxygen-to-iron abundance ratio in the metal-poor star HD 140283 by using the O I triplet at 7772-7775 Angstrom and the forbidden [O I] line at 6300 Angstrom. Our results for the oxygen abundance confirm the values reported in some recent investigations. While the oxygen abundance derived from the O I IR triplet is not very sensitive to the presence of granulation inhomogeneities, such three- dimensional effects amount to similar to-0.2 dex for the [O I] line. The NLTE abundance correction for the O I IR triplet turns out to be -0.2 dex, approximately. Interestingly, when both NLTE and three- dimensional effects are taken into account there still remain significant discrepancies in the iron abundances derived from Fe I and Fe II lines, as well as in the oxygen abundances inferred from the O I and [O I] lines. We conclude that the discrepancies could be due to uncertainties in the stellar parameters of this metal-poor star. We argue that adopting T-eff approximate to 5600 K (instead of T-eff approximate to 5700 K) and [Fe/H] approximate to -2.0 (instead of [Fe/H] approximate to -2.5) substantially reduces the discrepancies in the abundances of iron and oxygen inferred from several spectral lines. Under such circumstances, we find [O/Fe] approximate to 0.5 at [Fe/H] = -2. Obviously, our tentative conclusion that the metallicity of this type of metal-poor star is significantly larger than previously thought may have far-reaching implications in stellar astrophysics.									56	1	0	0	0	0	56			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000226293800037		
C	Butterman, Heidi C.; Castaldi, Marco J.						Castaldi, MJ; White, M		CO(2) Enhanced Steam Gasification of Biomass Fuels								16TH ANNUAL NORTH AMERICAN WASTER TO ENERGY CONFERENCE NAWTEC16								157	172		10.1115/NAWTEC16-1949				2008	2008	The current study involves an experimental investigation of the decomposition of various biomass feedstocks and their conversion to gaseous fuels such as hydrogen. The steam gasification process resulted in higher levels of H(2) and CO for various CO(2) input ratios. With increasing rates of CO(2) introduced into the feed stream, enhanced char conversion and increased CO levels were observed. While CH(4) evolution was present throughout the gasification process at consistently low concentrations, H(2) evolution was at significantly higher levels though it was detected only at elevated gasification temperatures: above 500 degrees C for the herbaceous and non-wood samples and above 650 degrees C for the wood biomass fuels studied.The biomass feedstocks were studied through the use of Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), Gas Chromatography, Calorimetry, Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS), and the Scanning Electron Microscope with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (SEM/EDX). The chemical composition of the various biomass fuels and their combustion and gasification ash residues, in addition to the mass decay and gaseous evolution behavior were investigated as a function of temperature.The thermal treatment of biomass fuels involves pyrolysis and gasification with combustion occurring at the higher temperatures. In the gasification environment, when combustion processes are occurring, gaseous components evolve from the fuel and react with oxygen either released from the biomass structure itself, or from the injected steam and CO(2). These high temperature reactions are responsible for the enhanced burnout of the carbon (charcoal) structure that is produced during the low temperature pyrolytic breakdown of the biomass. Since the ligno-cellulosic biomass component typically found in U.S. MSW is greater than 50%, techniques to enhance the thermal treatment of biomass feedstocks can also aid in the processing of MSW.Gas evolution as a function of temperature was monitored for H(2), CH(4), CO(2) and CO for several biomass fuels that included woods, grasses and other ligno-cellulosic samples. These included oak, sugar maple, poplar, spruce, white pine, Douglas fir, alfalfa, cordgrass, beachgrass, maple bark, pine needles, blue noble fir needles, pecan shells, almond shells, walnut shells, wheat straw, and green olive pit. The TGA mass decay curves showed similar behavior for the woods, grasses and agricultural residues, where most of the mass loss occurred before 500 degrees C. Most feedstocks exhibited 2 constant mass steps though several exhibited a third with completed mass loss by 900 degrees-1000 degrees C. Two distinct mass decay regimes were found to correlate well with two distinct gas evolution regimes exhibited in the curves for CO, H(2) and CH(4). Most of the mass loss occurred during pyrolysis, with the remaining degradation to ash or char occurring in the high temperature gasification regime.One characteristic of biomass samples is the highly variable nature of the mineral composition. SEM/EDX analyses indicated high levels of potassium, magnesium and phosphorus in the ash residue. The devitrification and embrittlement of the quartz furnace and balance rods were attributed to the high mineral content of many of the biomass feedstocks, with the high alkaline oxide levels of the grasses being particularly destructive. While mineral content may exert a beneficial effect through enhanced char reactivity with the possibility for a more thorough processing of the feedstock, the potential for corrosion and slagging would necessitate the judicious selection and possible pretreatment of biomass fuels. A major advantage of thermal treatment through gasification prior to combustion is the ability to remove many of the corrosive volatiles and ash elements such as potassium, sodium and chlorine to avert damage to the process equipment.					16th Annual North American Waste to Energy Conference16th Annual North American Waste to Energy Conference	MAY 19-21, 2008MAY 19-21, 2008	ASME, Solid Waste Proc Div; Integral Waste Serv Assoc; Solid Waste Assoc N AmerASME, Solid Waste Proc Div; Integral Waste Serv Assoc; Solid Waste Assoc N Amer	Philadelphia, PAPhiladelphia, PA	3	0	0	0	0	0	3					978-0-7918-4293-5	WOS:000262507500024

Herein, we prepare a unique 2D-2D architecture photocatalyst composed of CoP and ZnIn2S4(ZIS) nanosheets through electrostatic self-assembly method. The constructed 2D-2D CoP/ZIS exhibit a remarkably enhanced photocatalytic performance with hydrogen production rate of 8.775 mmol g(-1) h(-1), and this value is much higher than ZIS and most of other ZIS-based nanohybrids. Additionally, the nanohybrids possess excellent stability with 96.3% of initial activity remaining after 24 hours of testing. These satisfactory results are attributed to the large/intimate contact interface and the photo/electro-chemical properties of ZIS and CoP, which improves light absorption, facilitates photoelectron transport and suppresses charge recombination. This work not only demonstrates ZIS nanosheet can serve as a versatile and effective platform supporting non-noble metal nanosheets to boost their photocatalytic performance, but also offers a general and simple electrostatic self-assembly method to design 2D-2D-based heterostructures for hydrogen conversion from water splitting.									23	2	0	0	2	0	23			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000567391900001

At the latter epoch spectropolarimetry was also attempted, yielding a polarization upper limit of similar to 2%. The spectra show strong [O I] and Mg I] emission lines, as expected in Type Ic supernovae, but weak Ca ii lines. The [ Fe ii] lines that were strong in SN 1998bw are much weaker in SN 2006aj, consistent with its lower luminosity. The outer velocity of the line-emitting region is similar to 8000 km s(-1) in July and similar to 7400 km s(-1) in September, consistent with the relatively low expansion kinetic energy of SN 2006aj. All lines have similar width, and their profiles indicate that no major asymmetries are present in the ejecta at velocities below v < 8000 km s(-1), except perhaps in the innermost part. The spectra were modeled with a non-LTE code. The mass of (56)Ni required to power the emission is similar to 0: 20 M(circle dot), confirming earlier results based on the light curve. The oxygen mass is similar to 1: 5 M(circle dot), again much less than in SN 1998bw, but similar to 0: 7 M(circle dot) larger than the value derived from the early-time modeling. The ejected mass below 8000 km s(-1) is similar to 2 M(circle dot), confirming that SN 2006aj was only about twice as massive and energetic as the normal Type Ic SN 1994I. The presence of a dense inner core, containing similar to 1 M(circle dot) of mostly oxygen and carbon, is inferred, as in all broad-lined SNe Ic. This core, which may be disklike, is too deep to influence the early light curve and too small to affect the late polarization spectrum.									44	0	0	0	0	0	44			0004-637X			WOS:000246947100022

However, the role of the halogen layer, consisting of single or double layers, was not known. In this study, we examined a Sillen-type layered oxyhalide PbBi3O4X3 (X = Cl, Br) with alternating stacks of single/double halogen layers and skeletal Bi-based oxide layers. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of PbBi3O4X3 revealed that the two inequivalent halogen layers contribute differently to the valence band density of states; the halogen p orbitals in double layers are higher in energy and responsible for the VBM, which is understood in terms of Madelung site potentials, where the electrostatic repulsion between halide ions is at play. Another finding from the DFT calculation is the spatial separation of the conduction band minimum and the VBM based on the asymmetry of halogen layers, which may promote the charge separation. While both PbBi3O4Cl3 and PbBi3O4Br3 possess band levels appropriate for visible-light-induced water splitting, only the former showed photocatalytic O-2 evolution activity. The stability of PbBi3O4Cl3 is due to the significant contribution of the O-2p orbitals to its VBM, in stark contrast to PbBi3O4Br3, where Br-4p predominately contributes to the VBM. PbBi3O4Cl3 functions as a stable O-2-evolving photocatalyst in Z-scheme water splitting under visible light irradiation. These results show that the electrostatic repulsion of halogen layers is a key factor for tuning the valence band structure of oxyhalides while maintaining sufficient stability for water-splitting photocatalysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000730305400001

To elucidate the mechanism of conversion of phenylacetone by PAMO, we have performed a detailed steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic analysis. In the catalytic cycle (k(cat) = 3.1 s(-1)), rapid binding of NADPH (K(d) = 0.7 mu M) is followed by a transfer of the 4(R)-hydride from NADPH to the FAD cofactor (k(red) = 12 s(-1)). The reduced PAMO is rapidly oxygenated by molecular oxygen (k(ox) = 870 mM(-1) s(-1)), yielding a C4a-peroxyflavin. The peroxyflavin enzyme intermediate reacts with phenylacetone to form benzylacetate (k(1) = 73 s(-1)). This latter kinetic event leads to an enzyme intermediate which we could not unequivocally assign and may represent a Criegee intermediate or a C4a-hydroxyflavin form. The relatively slow decay (4.1 s(-1)) of this intermediate yields fully reoxidized PAMO and limits the turnover rate. NADP(+) release is relatively fast and represents the final step of the catalytic cycle. This study shows that kinetic behavior of PAMO is significantly different when compared with that of sequence-related monooxygenases, e.g., cyclohexanone monooxygenase and liver microsomal flavin-containing monooxygenase. Inspection of the crystal structure of PAMO has revealed that residue R337, which is conserved in other BVMOs, is positioned close to the flavin cofactor. The analyzed R337A and R337K mutant enzymes were still able to form and stabilize the C4a-peroxyflavin intermediate. The mutants were unable to convert either phenylacetone or benzyl methyl sulfide. This demonstrates that R337 is crucially involved in assisting PAMO-mediated Baeyer-Villiger and sulfoxidation reactions.									84	0	1	0	61	0	85			0006-2960			WOS:000254408200012	18321069

R-L comprises two main components, R-r resulting from light-induced decrease in tricarboxylic acid activity, and R-S related to extra CO2 evolution resulting from citrate-to-2-oxoglutarate conversion for N-assimilation in NO3- grown leaves. This extended theory was applied to two experiments. First, A-C-i curves ( dependence of CO2 flux on stomatal CO2 concentration) revealed a higher apparent CO2 compensation point (Gamma*(app)) in NO3--grown plants than in NH4+-grown plants. Secondly, photosynthetic electron fluxes at different light intensities were determined by means of the Genty parameter of chlorophyll fluorescence and compared with those calculated from measured CO2 uptake. Curve-fitting based on the extended theory provided a coincidence of these two measurements and resulted in higher R-S in NO3--grown than in NH4+-grown plants. This difference in R-S ( about 15% of the CO2 flux bound by carboxylation) is the same as that obtained from the analysis of Gamma*app. Further, the analysis suggests that J(L) related to the extra electron flux used for N-assimilation in NO3--grown plants is diverted to other sinks in NH4+-grown plants. SHAM decreased photosynthetic electron flow and O-2 evolution in NH4+-grown plants, antimycin A in NO3--grown plants. The effect of oligomycin was small. The results are discussed in terms of different mechanisms of chloroplast/ mitochondrion interaction in NO3-- and NH4+-grown plants, their effects on non-photorespiratory CO2 evolution and on Gamma*(app).									51	9	0	0	49	0	57			0031-9317	1399-3054		WOS:000227318000007

TMGa exhibits high vapor pressure and therefore facilitates deposition at lower substrate temperatures. The Ga2O3 films were characterized by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements. The SE data show linear thickness evolution with a growth rate of similar to 0.66 angstrom per cycle and inhomogeneity of <= 2% for all samples. The refractive index of the Ga2O3 thin films is 1.86 +/- 0.01 (at 632.8 nm) and independent of temperature, whereas the bandgap slightly decreases from 4.68 eV at T-s of 80 degrees C to 4.57 eV at 200 degrees C. XPS analysis revealed ideal stoichiometric gallium to oxygen ratios of 2:3 for the Ga2O3 layers with the lowest carbon contribution of similar to 10% for the sample prepared at 150 degrees C. The permittivity of the layers is 9.7 +/- 0.2 (at 10 kHz). In addition, fixed and mobile oxide charge densities of 2-4 x 10(12) and 1-2 x 10(12) cm(-2), respectively, were observed in the C-V characteristics. Moreover, the Ga2O3 films show breakdown fields in the range of 2.2-2.7 MV/cm. Excellent optical and electrical material properties are maintained even at low substrate temperatures as low as 80 degrees C. Hence, the TMGa/O-2 PEALD process is suitable for electronic and optoelectronic applications where low-temperature growth is required.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			0734-2101	1520-8559		WOS:000518005200001

Electrochemical water splitting driven by renewable electricity to produce green hydrogen with highpurity has been considered to be a promising technology. Unfortunately, the reaction of water electrolysis always requires a large excess potential, let alone the large-scale application (e.g., >500 mA cm-2 needs a cell voltage range of 1.8-2.4 V). Thus, developing cost-effective and robust transition metal electrocatalysts working at high current density is imperative and urgent for industrial electrocatalytic water splitting. In this review, the strategies and requirements for the design of self-supported electrocatalysts are summarized and discussed. Subsequently, the fundamental mechanisms of water electrolysis (OER or HER) are analyzed, and the required important evaluation parameters, relevant testing conditions and potential conversion in exploring electrocatalysts working at high current density are also introduced. Specifically, recent progress in the engineering of self-supported transition metal-based electrocatalysts for either HER or OER, as well as overall water splitting (OWS), including oxides, hydroxides, phosphides, sulfides, nitrides and alloys applied in the alkaline electrolyte at large current density condition is highlighted in detail, focusing on current advances in the nanostructure design, controllable fabrication and mechanistic understanding for enhancing the electrocatalytic performance. Finally, remaining challenges and outlooks for constructing self-supported transition metal electrocatalysts working at large current density are proposed. It is expected to give guidance and inspiration to rationally design and prepare these electrocatalysts for practical applications, and thus further promote the practical production of hydrogen via electrochemical water splitting.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000678762600001	34477767

However, 3D supports with geometrically complex designs are very difficult to prepare directly by conventional methods. Here we have demonstrated that high performance catalyst supports with customized three-dimensional metal architectures can be achieved through a direct 3D printing technique, which allows investigating the relationship between 3D support structures and OER performance. Such 3D supports, optimized with control over the design, can possess good electrical conductivity, high mechanical strength and large surface areas, with tunable porous and hollow structures and large holes for effective electrolyte circulation and quick removal of bubbles, all contributing to the enhanced electrocatalytic performance. Because of the large increase in the electrochemically active surface area achieved by 3D printing, when high catalytic activity NiCo2S4 nanoneedles are grown in situ on the optimized 3D support, dramatic improvements in electrochemical performance can be obtained with a low Tafel slope (38.7 mV dec(-1)) and overpotential (226 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2). Surprisingly, at a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2), the overpotential of the designed electrode is as low as 277 mV. Importantly, the NiCo2S4 coating also plays a key role in corrosion protection for the 3D-printed metal support in alkaline media. 3D printing and catalyst coating provide a flexible and versatile approach for the design and fabrication of novel support structures for electrocatalytic applications.									19	2	0	0	0	0	19			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000479056700012

Global healthcare systems are overwhelmed with high positive patient numbers. Silent hypoxia accompanied by rapid deterioration and some cases with septic shock is responsible for COVID-19 mortality in many hospitalized patients. There is an urgent need to further understand the relationships and interplay with human host components during pathogenesis and immune evasion strategies. Currently, acquired immunity through vaccination or prior infection usually provides sufficient protection against the emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 except Omicron variant requiring recent booster. New strains have shown higher viral loads and greater transmissibility with more severe disease presentations. Notably, COVID-19 has a peculiar prognosis in severe patients with iron dysregulation and hypoxia which is still poorly understood. Studies have shown abnormally low serum iron levels in severe infection but a high iron overload in lung fibrotic tissue. Data from our in-silico structural analysis of the spike protein sequence along with host proteolysis processing suggests that the viral spike protein fragment mimics Hepcidin and is resistant to the major human proteases. This functional spike-derived peptide dubbed "Covidin" thus may be intricately involved with host ferroportin binding and internalization leading to dysregulated host iron metabolism. Here, we propose the possible role of this potentially allogenic mimetic hormone corresponding to severe COVID-19 immunopathology and illustrate that this molecular mimicry is responsible for a major pathway associated with severe disease status. Furthermore, through 3D molecular modeling and docking followed by MD simulation validation, we have unraveled the likely role of Covidin in iron dysregulation in COVID-19 patients. Our meta-analysis suggests the Hepcidin mimetic mechanism is highly conserved among its host range as well as among all new variants to date including Omicron. Extensive analysis of current mutations revealed that new variants are becoming alarmingly more resistant to selective human proteases associated with host defense.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			0730-2312	1097-4644		WOS:000740222000001	34997606

However, constructing double charge transfer paths by loading dual cocatalysts in a nanocomposite is still a great challenge. Here, hollow Co9S8 nanocages are utilized to design a hierarchical Co9S8/CdIn2S4/Pt heterostructure with dual-channel for charge transfer, in which Co9S8 nanocages and Pt particles act as cocatalysts. Moreover, Co9S8 and CdIn2S4 form an atomic interfacial contact by intermediate sulfur atoms. Due to double-channel charge transfer and atomic interfacial bonding, the Co9S8/CdIn2S4/Pt nanocages accelerate the photo-induced carriers transfer and suppress the combination of electron-hole pairs. As a result, the Co9S8/CdIn2S4/Pt nanocages exhibit increased photocurrent density of 62.8 mu A cm(-2), far exceeding that of pristine Co9S8 (6.87 mu A cm(-2)). The optimized Co9S8/CdIn2S4/Pt nanocages display excellent photocatalytic H-2 in production rate of 13 426 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) and high cyclic stability for water splitting.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2196-7350			WOS:000771917400001

However, there are still major challenges in the design of bifunctional catalysts and gain deep insight into the mechanism of both water dissociation and dehydrogenation kinetics triggered by the same active species during HzOR-assisted OWS. Here, ruthenium single atoms (Ru SAs) anchored onto sulphur-vacancies of tungsten disulphide (WS2) are prepared by a sulfidation and facile galvanostatic deposition strategy. The WS2/Ru SAs act as a bifunctional catalyst and outperforms commercial platinum (Pt) catalysts for both HzOR and HER. Ultralow potentials of -74 and -32.1 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) are achieved for HzOR and HER, respectively. Two-electrode electrolyzer using WS2/Ru SAs as both anode and cathode reaches 10 mA cm(-2) with cell voltage of only 15.4 mV, which is far below that of most electrocatalysts including commercial Pt. Density functional theory calculations unravel the critical role of Ru SAs in WS2, where the sluggish dissociation of water in HER can be promoted on Ru sites, and the sulfur sites of WS2 exhibit a more thermoneutral behavior for hydrogen intermediate adsorption. Moreover, Ru sites are also active centers for stepwise hydrazine dehydrogenation during HzOR.									13	1	0	0	1	0	13			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000739115600001

Interfacial models of LixO2 (x = 4, 2, and 1) intermediates adsorbed on doped TiC surface were used to simulate the structural evolution during discharging/charging process. The catalytic activity was quantitatively assessed by specific ORR/OER overpotential, and some intrinsic factors affecting the catalytic activity of doped TiC were determined based on the structure-activity relationships established. The catalytic activity of doped TiC can be divided into two groups, wherein B-, N-, and P-doped TiC have better catalysis than Al- and Si-doped TiC. Among them, B- doped TiC displays the lowest ORR overpotential, suggesting that B-doped TiC has the best catalytic activity of ORR. The stronger (Li2O)(2)/Li2O2/LiO2 adsorption energy induces lower ORR and OER overpotentials. The stronger Li+ desorption energy attracts lower ORR overpotential, while the weaker O-2 desorption energy induces lower OER overpotential. Consequently, adsorption energy of (Li2O)(2)/Li2O2/LiO2 and desorption energy of Li+/O-2 are useful factors for characterizing the catalytic activity. These findings contribute to understand the doping effect on catalysis and provide insights into the screening and design of novel catalyst in Li-O-2 batteries.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000487838900110

To gain insights in transcriptional reprogramming during late hours of waterlogging stress under field conditions, we aimed to elucidate the transcriptional and anatomical changes in two contrasting maize inbreds viz. I110 (susceptible) and I172 (tolerant). Waterlogging stress reduced dry matter translocations from leaves and stems to ears, resulting in a lack of sink capacity and inadequate grain filling in I110, thus decreased the grain yield drastically. The development of aerenchyma cells within 48 h in I172 enabled hypoxia tolerance. The upregulation of alanine aminotransferase, ubiquitin activating enzyme E1, putative mitogen activated protein kinase and pyruvate kinase in I172 suggested that genes involved in protein degradation, signal transduction and carbon metabolism provided adaptive mechanisms during waterlogging. Overexpression of alcohol dehydrogenase, sucrose synthase, aspartate aminotransferase, NADP dependent malic enzyme and many miRNA targets in I110 indicated that more oxygen and energy consumption might have shortened plant survival during long-term waterlogging exposure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of transcript profiling at late stage (24-96 h) of waterlogging stress under field conditions and provides new visions to understand the molecular basis of waterlogging tolerance in maize.									8	1	0	0	7	0	9			0168-9452	1873-2259		WOS:000626081800002	33568312	
J	Montavon, Philippe; Rade Kukic, Koraljka; Bortlik, Karlheinz								A simple method to measure effective catalase activities: Optimization, validation, and application in green coffee								ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY				360	2			207	215		10.1016/j.ab.2006.10.035				JAN 15 2007	2007	Oxidative metabolism in coffee cherries during maturation appears to be regulated by the timely expression of redox enzymes such as catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and polyphenoloxidase (PPO). Among these enzymes, CAT is suspected to contribute significantly in setting the redox status of the healthy cherry and the processed bean. The initial redox status of the green bean might further control the nature and dynamics of reactions induced by roasting and eventually quality aspects of the end product. In this respect, Arabica (Coffea arabica) and Robusta (Coffea canephora) typically differ by their cup coffee flavor profiles. We developed an assay that allowed us to screen numerous green coffee samples for effective CAT activities. The proposed assay, which monitors CAT activities by online oxygen sensing in green coffee crude suspensions incubated with H2O2, seeks to integrate potential effects of endogenous inhibitors and activators. After optimization and validation of the assay, 23 Arabicas, 23 Robustas, and 8 Arabustas were analyzed. Nearly all Arabicas (22 of 23) harbored high CAT activity levels, whereas all Robustas harbored low ones. Arabustas performed like Arabicas of the lower CAT activity range. The traditional spectrophotometric assay did not reveal these specificities. Because of its simplicity, our assay might be valuable for assessing effective CAT activities in various plant tissues.

Different wt% of BiVO4 (2.5, 5 and 10 wt%) have been loaded on nanoporous MCM-41 supports and also the hydrothermal synthetic time has been varied to design a series of photocatalysts. XRD suggests well formation of crystalline BiVO4, TEM confirms small sized BiVO4 nanocrystals uniformly distributed on nanoporous MCM-41 support, UV-vis DRS and PL indicates red shift and lower recombination of BM nanocomposites. The photocatalytic water splitting to generate O-2 and toxic organic dye (Rh 6G) degradation studies have been evaluated using these efficient nanocomposite photocatalysts. 5 wt% BiVO4/MCM-41@ 4 h (BM-4) catalyst shows the best results in both O-2 generation (691.3 mu mol in 4 h) and 98% of Rhodamine 6G degradation respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activity may be attributed to nanoporous architecture, quantum size of BiVO4, high surface area, better light harvestation and electron transfer.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8				2213-3437		WOS:000414041300039

Members of the Equus caballus Endogenous Retrovirus (EqERV) family affect several of these abilities in horses. EqERV elements have been integrated in the horse genome during evolution and generate repeat elements such as long terminal repeats (LTRs). LTR sequences are involved in retrovirus replication and play an essential function in post transcriptional control mechanisms, such as by providing binding sites for microRNAs (miRNAs) or generating miRNA precursors. In this study, we identified a novel miRNA derived from EqERV-E1 LTR using various bioinformatics tools. To examine the relationship between EqERV-E1 LTR and similar elements, we used BLAST2seq and phylogenetic analysis. LTR sequences were located in the untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs and also formed the stem-loop secondary structure. The sequence was registered in the DDBJ database as LTR derived miRNA under the accession number corresponding to LC383797 (referred to eca-miR-1804). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to confirm the expression of eca-miR-1804 and the similar miR1255a, showed an almost identical expression pattern in eight different equine tissues. Therefore, these data imply that the LTR could function as an miRNA, which is expressed in the examined equine tissues. In addition, the current study provides inputs for additional functional studies concerning the LTR of other EqERV families.									5	0	1	0	4	0	5			0378-1119	1879-0038		WOS:000456753500031	30453070

Herein, the main approaches employing organic semiconductor-based devices toward solar H-2 generation via water splitting are compared and performance demonstrations are reviewed. OPV-biased water electrolysis is seen to advance significantly with the development of the tandem OPV device and the optimization of operating potential and redox catalysts. This approach now exceeds 6% solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency while over 10% is reasonably feasible. By contrast, while the direct water splitting by an organic semiconductor in a photo-electrochemical cell has attractive advantages, increasing the performance remains a challenge. Photocathodes employing a bulk-heterojunction have been optimized to give 7-8 mA cm(-2) water reduction photocurrent under standard conditions, but photoanodes remain <1 mA cm(-2), and robustness remains a critical issue. However, recent investigations into the direct organic semiconductor/electrolyte interface have brought important insights into free charge generation, the nature of the semiconductor/catalyst interface, and the stability of organic photoelectrodes. Outlooks toward advancing both approaches are discussed.									62	3	0	0	3	0	62			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000450269900019

The water oxidation half-reaction typically proceeds with poor efficiency and produces the unprofitable and often damaging product, O-2. Herein, we demonstrate an alternative approach and couple solar H-2 generation with value-added organic substrate oxidation. Solar irradiation of a cyanamide surface-functionalized melon-type carbon nitride ((CNx)-C-NCN) and a molecular nickel(II) bis(diphosphine) H-2-evolution catalyst (NiP) enabled the production of H-2 with concomitant selective oxidation of benzylic alcohols to aldehydes in high yield under purely aqueous conditions, at room temperature and ambient pressure. This one-pot system maintained its activity over 24 h, generating products in 1:1 stoichiometry, separated in the gas and solution phases. The (CNx)-C-NCN-NiP system showed an activity of 763 mu mol (g CNx)(-1) h(-1) toward H-2 and aldehyde production, a Ni-based turnover frequency of 76 h(-1), and an external quantum efficiency of 15% (lambda = 360 +/- 10 nm). This precious metal-free and nontoxic photocatalytic system displays better performance than an analogous system containing platinum instead of NiP. Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that the photoactivity of (CNx)-C-NCN is due to efficient substrate oxidation of the material, which outweighs possible charge recombination compared to the nonfunctionalized melon type carbon nitride. Photoexcited (CNx)-C-NCN in the presence of an organic substrate can accumulate ultralong-lived "trapped electrons", which allow for fuel generation in the dark. The artificial photosynthetic system thereby catalyzes a closed redox cycle showing 100% atom economy and generates two value-added products, a solar chemical, and solar fuel.									207	8	0	0	23	0	208			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000380730000038	27337491

These organelles are present in all major eukaryotic lineages, nevertheless, information regarding the presence of peroxisomes in opportunistic parasitic protozoa is scarce and in many cases it is still unknown whether these organisms have peroxisomes at all. Here, we performed ultrastructural, cytochemical, and bioinformatic studies to investigate the presence of peroxisomes in three genera of free-living amoebae from two different taxonomic groups that are known to cause fatal infections in humans. By transmission electron microscopy, round structures with a granular content limited by a single membrane were observed in Acanthamoeba castellanii, Acanthamoeba griffini, Acanthamoeba polyphaga, Acanthamoeba royreba, Balamuthia mandrillaris (Amoebozoa), and Naegleria fowled (Heterolobosea). Further confirmation for the presence of peroxisomes was obtained by treating trophozoites in situ with diaminobenzidine and hydrogen peroxide, which showed positive reaction products for the presence of catalase. We then performed comparative genomic analyses to identify predicted peroxin homologues in these organisms. Our results demonstrate that a complete set of peroxins-which are essential for peroxisome biogenesis, proliferation, and protein import-are present in all of these amoebae. Likewise, our in silico analyses allowed us to identify a complete set of peroxins in Naegleria lovaniensis and three novel peroxin homologues in Naegleria gruberi. Thus, our results indicate that peroxisomes are present in these three genera of free-living amoebae and that they have a similar peroxin complement despite belonging to different evolutionary lineages.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			1759-6653			WOS:000593024100005	32602891	
J	Luersen, K; Walter, RD; Muller, S								The putative gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase from Plasmodium falciparum contains large insertions and a variable tandem repeat								MOLECULAR AND BIOCHEMICAL PARASITOLOGY				98	1			131	142		10.1016/S0166-6851(98)00161-3				JAN 5 1999	1999	The tripeptide glutathione plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of the thiol redox state of the cell and for the detoxification of reactive oxygen species. Glutathione is synthesized in two consecutive reactions by gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS) and glutathione synthetase, respectively. The former enzyme represents the rate limiting step of the synthetic pathway. We have cloned the cDNA and gene of a putative gamma-GCS from Plasmodium falciparum. The contiguous cDNA sequences obtained from various cDNA libraries of P. falciparum K1 and 3D7 encompass 4206 bp or 4038 bp and encode polypeptides of 1119 and 1063 amino acids, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences show four regions of homology (identity: 31.3-43.9%) to human and Trypanosoma brucei gamma-GCS. These regions are interrupted by three large insertions between 94 and 239 amino acids. Within the first insert a variable repetitive motif was identified, which is responsible for the differing sizes of the sequences. We have analysed this phenomenon in five additional P. falciparum strains and found a high degree of variability in the number of the repeated octamer (Y/C)S(N/D)LQQ(Q/R). Therefore the predicted molecular mass of the proteins from different P. falciparum strains ranges from 124.4 to 133.2 kDa, which is almost twice that of the catalytic subunit of the human host enzyme. Isolation of three genomic clones revealed that the gene does not contain introns. P. falciparum gamma-GCS transcription peaks in trophozoites (24-30 h) suggesting that the antioxidant glutathione is predominantly produced at a time where hemoglobin degradation and the simultaneous formation of reactive oxygen species is maximal.

Herein, we report robust and reliable defect-rich Ru/g-C3N4 nanosheet catalysts for electrochemical hydrogen generation both in alkaline and acidic electrolytes. The catalyst can be fabricated by facile pyrolysis of the freeze-dried Ru3+-melamine complex, and efficient Ru-N coupling was demonstrated by some spectroscopic characterizations. Theoretical analysis revealed efficient orbital hybridization of Ru and N for Ru-N bond formation in the system, and thereby favorable electron transfer and intermediate adsorption property. As a result, the proposed catalysts exhibited small overpotentials of 27 mV and 34 mV in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, respectively, to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), when loaded on an inert glassy carbon electrode, which ranked among the top Ru-based catalysts. It also exhibited high catalytic stability including 10 000 CV cycles in the dynamic stability study and 20 hours of steady-state operation. The multiple fold increase in intrinsic activity over Ru/C was indicated by specific activity, mass activity, and turnover frequency values; rapid charge transfer, faster kinetics and increased active site exposure were also observed on this catalyst system due to the efficient Ru-N coupling. The current work reports a facile approach for Ru-N coupling structure fabrication and its contribution to the high HER performance, which is conducive to the development of high-performing Ru-based catalysts.									17	1	0	0	2	0	16			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000667338400001

Therefore, we firstly constructed a novel Mo-NiCoP@NiCoP/NiXCoYH2PO2 (MNCP@NCP/NiXCoYH2PO2) core/shell nanorod heterostructure by hydrothermal and two-step phosphating on nickel foam (NF). It is worth noting that Mo-doping could availably regulate the electronic structure of NiCoP(NCP), resulting in the increased exposure of the active center and the increased inherent activity of each site. Furthermore, a strategy of improving catalyst activity was proposed, that is, the NiCoP nanorod core and Mo-NiCoP/NiXCoYH2PO2 nanorod shell was constructed by the two phosphating reactions to come into being mixed transition-metal phosphides (TMPs), thus improving the synergistic catalytic effect of the material. In addition, the water and urea electrolysis apparatus was installed from two MNCP@NCP/NiXCoYH2PO2 electrodes to actuate a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the necessary cell voltage was merely 1.348 V in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea for urea electrolysis, while the higher 1.522 V of cell voltage was required in 1.0 M KOH for water electrolysis, which is one of the best catalytic activities reported so far. Experimental results show that the oxyhydroxide is the real active site during urea electrolysis process. Density functional theory calculation shows that the doping of Mo and Co increase the water adsorption energy and conductivity of the oxyhydroxide material, so the water splitting performance of the catalyst is improved. Therefore, this work provided a new way to design bifunctional electrocatalysts by Modoping and two-step phosphating process. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To promote CO2 reduction, Pt/TiO2 has been deemed as a classic photocatalyst. In this study, we restudy Pt/TiO2 for the thermally assisted photo catalytic reduction of CO2 and reveal a different story between photocatalysis and photothermal catalysis. For example, when using disordered Pt/TiO2-x, the CO2 conversion via photocatalysis at 298 K is not impressive. However, when the system temperature is increased to 393 K, the CO2 conversion rate is significantly enhanced by a factor of 155 as compared to that obtainable from pristine TiO2; further, surprisingly high selectivity of CH, (87.5%) could be achieved. Thermally coupled photocatalysis yields the enhanced evolution of H-2 side products over Pt (4.06 nm)/TiO2 and promoted H-2 splitting over Pt (2.33 nm)/TiO2, which is seldom observed in conventional Pt/TiO2 photocatalysis. The synergy of mproved charge separation at the Pt/TiO2-x, interface induced by surface disordering and accelerated H2 consumption near smaller Pt nanoparticles by thermal assistance are believed to be critically important for the simultaneous enhancement of CO2 conversion rates and CH4 product selectivity. This study inspires revisiting not only Pt/TiO2 but also reactivating other semiconductor--oxide-based photocatalysts for use in thermally assisted photocatalysis.									41	4	0	0	4	0	43			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000524947900047	32103213	
J	Licht, S								Multiple band gap semiconductor/electrolyte solar energy conversion								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B				105	27			6281	6294		10.1021/jp010552j				JUL 12 2001	2001	Fundamental and experimental multiple band gap semiconductor/electrolyte processes to convert optical energy and utilize renewable solar energy are explored. Alternate processes discussed include an inverted (1 photon per e(-)) or bipolar (n greater than or equal to 2 photons per e(-)) arrangement of successive band gaps. Such processes can incorporate either a Schottky or an ohmic photoelectrochemical solution interface that can drive either regenerative single or multiple different redox reactions. The multiple redox case permits solar energy storage or solar water splitting evolving H-2 and provides an energy reservoir that may compensate for the intermittent nature of solar energy. Generated H-2 is attractive as a clean, renewable fuel. Experimental configurations examined include GaAs/Si or AlGaAs/Si photodriven redox couples, each with a solar to electrical conversion efficiency of 19-20%. A related solar cell is configured with electrochemical storage, which provides a nearly constant energetic output in illuminated or dark conditions. Similarly, multiple band gap semiconductors can also be utilized to generate hydrogen fuel by solar driven water splitting. A cell containing illuminated AlGaAs/Si RuO2/Pt-black evolves H-2 and O-2 at record (18.3%) efficiency. Contemporary models underestimate the attainable efficiency of solar energy conversion to water splitting, and future multiple band gap/electrolyte systems are calculated as being capable of attaining over 30% solar efficiency.									118	4	0	0	4	0	124			1089-5647			WOS:000169823800003

In this present study, two water-insoluble cobalt porphyrin complexes, cobalt(II) meso-tetraphenylporphyrin (CoP-1) and cobalt(II) 5,10,15,20-tetrakis-(4-bromophenyl) porphyrin (CoP-2), were synthesized and coated as thin films on the FTO working electrode. The films showed good activities for electrocatalytic water oxidation in aqueous solutions at pH 9.2. The Faradaic efficiencies of both films approached to similar to 100%, measured using a fluorescence-based oxygen sensor. The turnover frequencies were close to 0.50 s(-1) and 0.40 s(-1) for CoP-1 and CoP-2, respectively, under an applied anodic potential of 1.3 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at pH 9.2. Importantly, no cobalt oxide particles were observed on the working electrode after catalysis. The stability of the catalyst films was further evaluated by UV-vis spectroscopy, inhibition measurements, mass spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The pH dependence of water oxidation on CoP-1 and CoP-2 suggested a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism. The catalyst films could be recycled and showed almost unchanged catalytic activities when they were reused in new electrocatalytic studies of water oxidation.									52	1	0	0	2	0	52			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000336796800014	24777036

The (Co,Fe)(3)O-4 nanoparticles are identified as the spinel phase through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The composite GDL is used as the air electrode for Zn-air batteries and shows excellent performance as a bifunctional catalyst with initial discharge and charge potentials of 1.19 V and 2.00 V, respectively, at 20 mA cm(-2). Cycling performance of the impregnated electrode compares favourably with benchmark Pt-RuO2 catalysts at both 10 mA cm(-2) and 20 mA cm(-2). The (Co,Fe)(3)O-4/N-CNT impregnated GDL had a final discharge/charge efficiency of 58.5 % after 100 h (200 cycles) of bifunctional cycling at 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to that of Pt-RuO2 (55.3 % efficiency). The cycling efficiency for (Co,Fe)(3)O-4/N-CNT impregnated GDL at 20 mA cm(-2) is also better than that for Pt-Ru (53.5 % vs 41.3 % after 50 h (100 cycles)). The result is a simple and easily scalable one-pot electrode synthesis method for high performing bi-functional air electrodes for Zn-air batteries.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10				2566-6223		WOS:000497483300001		
J	WHITMARSH, J; ECKERT, HJ; SCHONEICH, C; RENGER, G								FUNCTIONAL SIZE OF PHOTOSYSTEM-II DETERMINED BY RADIATION INACTIVATION								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				38	3			363	368		10.1007/BF00046762				DEC 1993	1993	The functional size of Photosystem II (PS II) was investigated by radiation inactivation. The technique provides an estimate of the functional mass required for a specific reaction and depends on irradiating samples with high energy gamma-rays and assaying the remaining activity. The analysis is based on target theory that has been modified to take into account the temperature dependence of radiation inactivation of proteins. Using PS II enriched membranes isolated from spinach we determined the functional size of primary charge separation coupled to water oxidation and quinone reduction at the Q(B) site: H2O --> (Mn)(4) --> Y-2 --> P680 --> Pheophytin --> Q --> phenyl-p-benzoquinone. Radiation inactivation analysis indicates a functional mass of 88 +/- 12 kDa for electron transfer from water to phenyl-p-benzoquinone. It is likely that the reaction center heterodimer polypeptides, D1 and D2, contribute approximately 70 kDa to the functional mass, in which case polypeptides adding up to approximately 20 kDa remain to be identified. Likely candidates are the alpha and beta subunits of cytochrome b(559) and the 4.5 kDA psbI gene product.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:A1993MX41700017	24317991

The carbonatites are composed mainly of dolomite (90 vol.%) and minor calcite (5 vol.%), with apatite, barite, celestine, aegirine, monazite and bastnaesite as accessory minerals. The rocks correspond to magnesiocarbonatites with a compositional range of 13.73-19.59 wt.% MgO, and 20.03-30.11 wt.% CaO, along with 1.65-3.31 wt.% total Fe2O3, 0.02-2.39 wt.% SiO2 and other minor elements, such as P2O5, Na2O and K2O. These magnesiocarbonatites are characterized by extreme enrichment in incompatible elements with high total rare earth element (REE) contents of 372-36965 ppm. The strontium [(Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) = 0.70378-0.70386], neodymium [epsilon(Nd)(t) = 12.51 - 13.59] and oxygen (delta O-18(V-SMOW) = 5.9 parts per thousand-8.0 parts per thousand) isotope values of these rocks are consistent with a mantle origin, whereas the magnesium (delta Mg-26 (_) -1.09 parts per thousand to -0.85 parts per thousand) and carbon (delta C-13(V-PDB) = -4.1 parts per thousand to -5.9 parts per thousand) isotopes are decoupled from mantle values and reflect signature of recycled sedimentary carbonates. Global plate tectonic models predict that sedimentary carbonates in convergent margins are subducted to deep domains in the mantle, with phase transitions from calcite/dolomite to magnesite, and eventually to periclase/perovskite. The involvement of a mantle plume enhances the normal mantle geotherms and promotes decomposition reactions of magnesite. The decoupling of Mg-C and Sr-Nd-O isotopes in the mangesiocarbonatites provides insights on the origin of carbonatites, and also illustrates a case of interaction between mantle plume and subduction-related components.

In all OH-initiated photo-oxidation experiments, first-generation oxidation products measured by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) could not fully explain the OH reactivity of the products measured by the laser photolysis/laser-induced fluorescence technique, and similar to 20%, similar to 40%, and similar to 70% of OH reactivity attributed to these volatile organic compound (VOC) products, respectively, were missing. A master chemical mechanism (MCM) calculation demonstrated that the observed OH reactivity during photo oxidation could be explained with secondary VOC products. It was found that vapor wall loss (VWL) and aerosol formation (AF) strongly affected the OH reactivity when the photochemical reaction was prolonged, i.e., multiple oxidations were involved. The MCM calculation showed that aromatics have almost twice the productivity of OH reactivity attributed to secondary VOC products, P-s_VOC, compared with isoprene and alpha-pinene at the beginning of the period not affected by VWL/AF. The evaluation of the missing OH reactivity from O-3 oxidation and the sequential multiple oxidations of secondary products still involves an uncertainty that originates from an incomplete knowledge of VWL/AF, and thus, further investigation is required to understand OH reactivity evolution in both chamber and ambient observations. The error in photolysis rate and possibly unconsidered reactions of secondary products, such as the pinonaldehyde case, also presents potential uncertainty in the OH reactivity prediction and thus requires evaluation.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1352-2310	1873-2844		WOS:000788224600002

Both NCNT and CNT air electrodes exhibit highly reversible electrochemical activities and large capacities under low current densities in SABs, while NCNT electrodes show much higher rate performance and extended cycling life under high current densities. The superior electrochemical behavior of NCNT electrodes is attributed to the robust network of aligned NCNTs, which enables rapid oxygen and liquid electrolyte transport while accommodating the volume change originating from discharge product aggregation during cycling. Moreover, uniform coverage of the discharge product has been observed on the NCNT air electrodes, in contrast to the random and discrete dispersion of discharge product on the CNT air electrodes. The unique morphologies and growth mechanism of discharge products on NCNT electrodes are believed to be due to the outstanding catalytic activity of the nitrogen-doped sites in the NCNTs, which play a critical role in the high cycling stability of NCNT air electrodes for SABs.

In both laboratory and field enclosure experiments snails crawled above the waterline for 2 h or longer, then returned to the water. Physella virgata react to chemical signals given off by crayfish actively foraging on conspecific snails; they do not react to inactive crayfish. Low dissolved oxygen, crowding, and disturbance of the sediments did not elicit "crawlout" behavior. Crawling above the waterline, by reducing the probability of encounter between vulnerable, thin-shelled snails and crayfish, is an adaptive response to predation.									102	4	0	0	99	0	106			0029-8549			WOS:A1991GA27000020	28313274

Using the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the previously purified ADP-dependent glucokinase, the corresponding gene as well as a related open reading frame were detected in the genome of P. furiosus. Both genes were successfully cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, yielding highly thermoactive ADP-dependent glucokinase and phosphofructokinase. The deduced amino acid sequences of both kinases were 21.1% identical but did not reveal significant homology with those of other known sugar kinases. The ADP-dependent phosphofructokinase was purified and characterized. The oxygen-stable protein had a native molecular mass of approximately 180 kDa and was composed of four identical 52-kDa subunits. It had a specific activity of 88 units/mg at 50 degrees C and a pH optimum of 6.5. As phosphoryl group donor, ADP could be replaced by GDP, ATP, and GTP to a limited extent. The K-m values for fructose 6-phosphate and ADP were 2.3 and 0.11 mM, respectively. The phosphofructokinase did not catalyze the reverse reaction, nor was it regulated by any of the known allosteric modulators of ATP dependent phosphofructokinases. ATP and AMP were identified as competitive inhibitors of the phosphofructokinase, raising the K-m for ADP to 0.34 and 0.41 mM, respectively.									81	1	0	0	76	0	86			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000081613100043	10409652

In this study, a facile and scalable immersion synthetic approach has been developed to grow ultrathin nickel hydroxide nanosheets in situ on commercial nickel foam (Ni(OH)(2)/NF) as an anode for the electrocatalytic oxidation of HMF to FDCA with complete HMF conversion, 100 % FDCA yield, and >99 % faradaic efficiency at 1.39 V (vs. RHE) within 90 min. Mechanistic studies reveal that the initial oxidation of HMF takes place at the carbonyl group and FDCA is generated through two further oxidation steps. Impressively, the synthesized Ni(OH)(2)/NF can also be used to electrocatalytically oxidize other alcohol/aldehyde-containing compounds to the targeted products in alkaline medium with 100 % yield and >94 % faradaic efficiency under a low oxidation potential of 1.39 V (vs. RHE) within short reaction times.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000659413500001	34013575

The high intrinsic activity in the interface engineering of the Ni/MoN heterostructures, the high conductivity and protection of NCNT, and the three-dimensional structure of the Ni/MoN@NCNT/CC contribute to its outstanding activity and stability for HER (overpotential of 207mV at 10mAcm(-2)) and OER (overpotential of 252mV at 10mAcm(-2)). Particularly, for HER, it can maintain a consistent potential at 100mAcm(-2) for 100h. Besides, for OER the generated surface roughness and larger surface area can enhance OER activity of the catalyst. When used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, it can achieve a current density of 10mAcm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.699V with excellent durability. This work provides a new strategy to fabricate three-dimensional heterostructured water-splitting electrocatalysts with large surface area.									16	2	0	0	1	0	18			2196-0216			WOS:000514289900021

The materials were fabricated by a high-temperature solid-state reaction. XRD measurements with Rietveld analysis confirmed the presence of an O3-type phase with R-3m symmetry for all compositions with the existence of the monophase region within 0.3 <= y <= 0.7 Fe substitution range. The linear variation of the unit cell parameters of the R-3m structure was found for the broad Fe concentration. The combined studies of thermogravimetric analysis, XPS and Mossbauer spectroscopy pointed at the formation of the oxygen vacancies along with spontaneous magnetization at low temperatures. The electrical conductivity of the NaFeyCo1-yO2 exhibits thermally activated character with low activation energies and decreases with the increasing of iron content. Electrochemical investigation of Na/Na+/NaxFeyCo1-yO2 revealed changes in the character of discharge curve as a function of iron content and enabled us to select the NaFe0.3Co0.7O2 as a material exhibiting optimal chemical composition assuring high, stable discharge capacity (180 mAh g(-1)) along with high operational potential. The EIS and GITT studies were performed in order to investigate the kinetics of the electrode processes. The relation between sodium diffusion coefficients and chemical composition confirmed enhanced performance in case of the NaFe0.3Co0.7O2 material.									10	1	0	0	0	0	11			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000463305900006

This is the first detection of atomic deuterium in the local universe in a location other than the nearby regions of the Galactic disk. We construct a velocity model for the sight line based on the numerous O I absorption lines detected in the ultraviolet spectra. We identify eight absorption-line components, two of which are associated with the high-velocity gas in Complex C at approximate to-128 and approximate to-112 km s(-1). A new Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) interferometer map of the H I 21 cm emission toward PG 1259+593 indicates that the sight line passes through a compact concentration of neutral gas in Complex C. We use the WSRT data together with single-dish data from the Effelsberg 100 m radio telescope to estimate the H I column density of the high-velocity gas and to constrain the velocity extents of the H I Lyman series absorption components observed by FUSE. We find N(H I) = (9.0 +/- 1.0) x 10(19) cm(-2), N(D I) = (2.0 +/- 0.6) x 10(15) cm(-2), and N(O I) = (7.2 +/- 2.1) x 10(15) cm(-2) for the Complex C gas (68% confidence intervals). The corresponding light-element abundance ratios are D/H = (2.2 +/- 0.7) x 10(-5), O/H = (8.0 +/- 2.5) x 10(-5), and D/O = 0.28 +/- 0.12. The metallicity of Complex C gas toward PG 1259+593 is approximately 1/6 solar, as inferred from the oxygen abundance [O/H] = -0.79+/-(0.12)(0.16). While we cannot rule out a value of D/H similar to that found for the local ISM (i.e., D/H similar to 1.5 x 10(-5)), we can confidently exclude values as low as those determined recently for extended sight lines in the Galactic disk (D/H < 1 x 10(-5)). Combined with the sub-solar metallicity estimate and the low nitrogen abundance, this conclusion lends support to the hypothesis that Complex C is located outside the Milky Way, rather than inside in material recirculated between the Galactic disk and halo. The value of D/H for Complex C is consistent with the primordial abundance of deuterium inferred from recent Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe observations of the cosmic microwave simple chemical evolution models that predict the amount of deuterium astration as a function of metallicity.									64	0	0	0	0	0	64			0067-0049	1538-4365		WOS:000188656800002		
J	Stolper, Daniel A.; Eiler, John M.								THE KINETICS OF SOLID-STATE ISOTOPE-EXCHANGE REACTIONS FOR CLUMPED ISOTOPES: A STUDY OF INORGANIC CALCITES AND APATITES FROM NATURAL AND EXPERIMENTAL SAMPLES								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE				315	5			363	411		10.2475/05.2015.01				MAY 2015	2015	Carbonate clumped-isotope geothermometry is a tool used to reconstruct formation or (re)equilibration temperatures of carbonate bearing minerals, including carbonate groups substituted into apatite. It is based on the preference for isotopologues with multiple heavy isotopes (for example, (CO2O2-)-C-13-O-16-O-18 groups) to be more abundant at equilibrium than would be expected if all isotopes were randomly distributed amongst all carbonate groups. Because this preference is only a function of temperature, excesses of multiply substituted species can be used to calculate formation temperatures without knowledge of the isotopic composition of water from which the mineral precipitated or other phases with which it may have equilibrated. However, the measured temperature could be modified after mineral growth if exchange of isotopes amongst carbonate groups within the mineral has occurred through internal isotope-exchange reactions. Because these exchange reactions occur through thermally activated processes, their rates depend on temperature and increase at higher temperatures. Thus internal isotope-exchange reactions could lead to effective re-equilibration at high temperatures, overprinting the original temperatures recorded during mineral growth. We measured clumped-isotope temperatures in carbonate bearing minerals (including apatites) from several carbonatites to constrain the kinetics of these internal isotope-exchange reactions. We observe two key trends for clumped-isotope temperatures in carbonatites: (i) clumped-isotope temperatures of apatites and carbonate-bearing minerals decrease with increasing intrusion depth and (it) apatites record lower clumped-isotope temperatures than carbonate minerals from the same intrusion. We additionally conducted heating experiments at different temperatures to derive the temperature dependence for the rate constants that describe the alteration of clumped-isotope temperatures with time in calcites and apatites. We find that calcites exhibit complex kinetics as has been seen in previous studies. To quantify these results, we constructed a model that incorporates both diffusion of isotopes through the crystal lattice and isotope-exchange reactions between adjacent carbonate groups. We tested this model through comparison to previous measurements of optical calcites and brachiopods and to samples with known cooling histories and find that the model is able to reasonably capture kinetic data from previous experiments and the observed clumped-isotope temperatures of calcites assuming geologically reasonable cooling rates. A similar model for apatite over-predicts the observed clumped-isotope temperatures found in natural samples; we hypothesize this discrepancy is the result of annealing of radiation damage in our experiments, which lowers the diffusivity and rate of isotope exchange of carbonate groups compared to damaged natural samples. Finally, we constructed models to explore how heating can alter recorded clumped-isotope temperatures. Our model predicts that samples change in clumped-isotope temperatures in two stages. The first stage changes the recorded clumped isotope temperatures by <1 degrees C if held at 75 degrees C for 100 million years and by up to similar to 40 degrees C if held at similar to 120 degrees C, but the clumped-isotope temperatures does not reach ambient values through this low-temperature mechanism.A second, slower change becomes effective at temperatures above 150 degrees C and can take the measured clumped-isotope temperature up to the true ambient temperature. This result implies that old (hundreds of million years) samples that have only experienced mild (<100-125 degrees C) thermal histories could exhibit small but measurable (order 10 degrees C) changes in their clumped-isotope temperatures. We compared this heating model to clumped-isotope measurements from paleosol samples from the Siwalik Basin in Nepal, which were buried up to 5 km and then rapidly exhumed to the surface; these samples often do not give reasonable surface temperatures. The modeled temperatures agree with measured temperatures of these samples, suggesting that partial re-equilibration during shallow crustal burial is responsible for their elevated clumped-isotope temperatures.									133	6	0	0	11	0	138			0002-9599	1945-452X		WOS:000368047400001

Selectivity is sensitive to the structure of active sites, and activity can be tailored by work function. Moreover, intrinsic active sites usually possess relatively high concentration compared to artificial ones. Here, antisite defects Mo-S2 and W-S2, intrinsic atomic defects of MoS2 and WS2 with a transition metal atom substituting a S-2 column, were investigated for CORR by density functional theory calculations. The steric hindrance from the special bowl structure of Mo-S2 and W-S2 ensured good selectivity towards CO methanation. Coordination environment variation of the active sites, the under-coordinated Mo or W atoms, effectively lowered the work function, making Mo-S2 and W-S2 highly active for CO methanation with the required potential of -0.47 and -0.49 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively. Moreover, high concentration of active sites and minimal structural deformation during the catalytic process of Mo-S2 and W-S2 enhanced their attraction for future commercial application.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000644960800001	33851508

In deep-mixing sceneries, material from the envelopes of globular-cluster giants is assumed to be mixed well into the hydrogen-burning shells of some (but not all) stars. There the abundances of a number of light elements are reshuffled by proton capture before the material is returned to the envelope above. The recent observations also put strong constraints on the conditions under which the reshuffling occurs. Shetrone's (BAAS, 27, 1432 1995; AJ, 112, 2639, 1996) estimates of magnesium isotope ratios provide especially powerful constraints on the reshuffling temperature for the brightest aluminum-rich M13 giants. We find that proton-capture nucleosynthesis can five an excellent account of the abundances of aluminum and the isotopes of magnesium in the brightest aluminum-rich Wants in M13-and of the abundances of oxygen and sodium as well. In order to match the observations, the abundances in about ninety percent of the material that makes up the envelopes of these stars would have to have been reshuffled by proton capture at a temperature near 70 million kelvins (MK). The maximum temperatures in the hydrogen shells of canonical models for bright M13 giants is only similar to 55 MK. We briefly discuss ways in which the observations and the models might be reconciled. Our ''best bet'' is that hydrogen burning occurs intermittently (at higher temperatures) in some M13 giants rather than steadily (at fewer temperatures) as it does in canonical models. We also find that recent rates for the Ne-Na cycle reactions (El Eid and Champagne, ApJ, 451, 298, 1995) suggest solutions to two earlier puzzles: the shape of the Na-O abundance anticorrelation observed in globular-cluster giants and the Na-N correlation observed in field halo giants.									61	0	0	0	0	0	61			0004-6280			WOS:A1997WN07300005

Herein, we emphasized a general and simple system to fabricate an arbitrary type of hollow multilayer heterogeneous organic framework. The hollow organic framework nanospheres comprising black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQD), carbon nitride, and polydopamine (PDA) (PDA@g-C3N4/BPQD) are fabricated using an electrostatic bonding method. Surprisingly, the self-assembly process of PDA@g-C(3)N(4)is not completely in accordance with the law of charge interactions, only positively charged g-C(3)N(4)and negatively charged PDA can self-assemble to obtain the desired structure. Furthermore, BPQD was further loaded onto the surface of PDA@g-C(3)N(4)to increase light utilization and strengthen the charge separation in the photochemical process. Benefiting from the hierarchical structure and the hollow spherical morphology, the PDA@g-C3N4/BPQD shows a significant photocatalytic H(2)production activity and the ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon triggering with near infrared (NIR) light. This method provides a proof-of-concept of an organic framework with a precisely controlled morphology.									6	2	0	0	0	0	6				2052-1537		WOS:000562931700006

However, little is known about how the trapped particulate matter, such as the incombustible ash, interacts with the catalyst and so may affect its performance. This operando study follows the evolution of the Pd found in two different model GPF systems: one containing ash components extracted from a GPF and another from a catalyst washcoat prior to adhesion onto the GPF. We show that the catalytic activity of the two systems vary when compared with a 0 g ash containing GPF. Compared to the 0 g ash sample the 20 g ash containing sample had a higher CO light off temperature, in addition, an oscillation profile for CO, CO2 and O-2 was observed, which is speculated to be a combination of CO oxidation, C deposition via a Boudouard reaction and further partial oxidation of the deposited species to CO. During the ageing procedure the washcoat sample reduces NO at a lower temperature than the 0 g ash sample. However, post ageing the 0 g ash sample recovers and both samples reduce NO at 310 degrees C. In comparison, the 20 g ash GPF sample maintains a higher NO reduction temperature of 410 degrees C post ageing, implying that the combination of high temperature ageing and presence of ash has an irreversible negative effect on catalyst performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0953-8984	1361-648X		WOS:000659271800001	33949972

In many eutrophic lakes, oxygen depletion in the bottom layer (hypolimnion) occurs annually during summer stratification. The temporal and spatial extent of summer hypolimnetic anoxia is determined by interactions between the lake and its external drivers (e.g., catchment characteristics, nutrient loads, meteorology) as well as internal feedback mechanisms (e.g., organic matter recycling, phytoplankton blooms). How these drivers interact to control the evolution of lake anoxia over decadal timescales will determine, in part, the future lake water quality. In this study, we used a vertical one-dimensional hydrodynamic-ecological model (GLM-AED2) coupled with a calibrated hydrological catchment model (PIHM-Lake) to simulate the thermal and water quality dynamics of the eutrophic Lake Mendota (USA) over a 37 year period. The calibration and validation of the lake model consisted of a global sensitivity evaluation as well as the application of an optimization algorithm to improve the fit between observed and simulated data. We calculated stability indices (Schmidt stability, Birgean work, stored internal heat), identified spring mixing and summer stratification periods, and quantified the energy required for stratification and mixing. To qualify which external and internal factors were most important in driving the interannual variation in summer anoxia, we applied a random-forest classifier and multiple linear regressions to modeled ecosystem variables (e.g., stratification onset and offset, ice duration, gross primary production). Lake Mendota exhibited prolonged hypolimnetic anoxia each summer, lasting between 50-60 d. The summer heat budget, the timing of thermal stratification, and the gross primary production in the epilimnion prior to summer stratification were the most important predictors of the spatial and temporal extent of summer anoxia periods in Lake Mendota. Interannual variability in anoxia was largely driven by physical factors: earlier onset of thermal stratification in combination with a higher vertical stability strongly affected the duration and spatial extent of summer anoxia. A measured step change upward in summer anoxia in 2010 was unexplained by the GLM-AED2 model. Although the cause remains unknown, possible factors include invasion by the predacious zooplankton Bythotrephes longimanus. As the heat budget depended primarily on external meteorological conditions, the spatial and temporal extent of summer anoxia in Lake Mendota is likely to increase in the near future as a result of projected climate change in the region.									10	0	0	0	5	0	10			1027-5606	1607-7938		WOS:000629131100002

In this study, a novel Pt nanoparticles-modified WO3@TiO2 core-shell ternary structure was synthesized and its photocatalytic property was evaluated by degrading 30 ppm of tetracycline (TC) under simulated solar light. It was found that the optimal Pt-WO3@TiO2 ternary structures exhibit extremely superior performance in photocurrent response (30 times higher) and photocatalysis (10 times higher) compared to the pristine WO3 nanorods. The enhanced photocatalytic performance is attributed to the long lifetime of charge carriers and the increment of oxygen vacancies generated by introducing Pt nanoparticles. The radicals trapping experiments verified a two-step TC photodegradation process which can be ascribed to the existence of superoxide radicals (center dot O-2(-)) and holes (h(+)). This work may shed light on the design of novel ternary core-shell structure for efficient degradation of TC under solar light.[GRAPHICS].									7	1	0	0	2	0	8			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000546882000003

DNA was extracted from symptomless and fasciated tissues and amplified by nested PCR using universal primers P1/P7 followed by R16F2n/R16R2 produced amplicons of 1.2 Kb. The nucleotide sequence analyses of the amplicons indicated that fasciated plants were infected by phytoplasma. Phylogenetic analysis placed the Crassula fasciation phytoplasmas in 16SrII-D group. Histochemical staining for reactive oxygen species indicated that phytoplasma infected (PI) tissues possess significantly higher levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) rather than superoxide (O-2(center dot-)) as compared with symptomless tissues. PI tissues were also associated with a significant increase in antioxidant enzyme activities (catalase, peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and glutathione reductase) and electrolyte leakage as compared with symptomless tissues.									2	0	0	0	2	0	3			0334-2123	1876-7184		WOS:000378145100007

The capability of direct probing of H2O2 in complex biological systems can offer potential for elucidating its manifold roles in living systems. Here we report the fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) WS2 nanosheet networks with flower-like morphologies on a variety of conducting substrates. The semiconducting WS2 nanosheets with largely exposed edge sites on flexible carbon fibers enable abundant catalytically active sites, excellent charge transfer, and high permeability to chemicals and biomaterials. Thus, the 3D WS2-based nano-bio-interface exhibits a wide detection range, high sensitivity and rapid response time for H2O2, and is capable of visualizing endogenous H2O2 produced in living RAW 264.7 macrophage cells and neurons. First-principles calculations further demonstrate that the enhanced sensitivity of probing H2O2 is attributed to the efficient and spontaneous H2O2 adsorption on WS2 nanosheet edge sites. The combined features of 3D WS2 nanosheet networks suggest attractive new opportunities for exploring the physiological roles of reactive oxygen species like H2O2 in living systems.									20	0	0	0	3	0	20			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000371665400048	26909564

The present work reports the formation mechanism of the key Mn-III intermediate realized through the study of the effects of several electrolyte anions and cations on the catalytic efficiency of birnessite. In situ spectroelectrochemical measurements show that the activity is controlled by a dynamic dissolution-oxidation process, wherein Mn-III is formed through the oxidation of labile uncomplexed Mn-II that reversibly shuttles between the birnessite and the electrolyte in a manner similar to the photoactivation in photosystem II. The role of electrolyte cations of different ionic radii and hydration strengths is to control the interlayer spacing, whereas electrolyte anions control the extent of deprotonation of complexed Mn-II in the lattice. Both in turn govern the shuttling efficiency of uncomplexed Mn-II and its subsequent electro-oxidation to Mn-III.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000775055100001	35253389

Substitution of beta-145 tyrosine by cysteine had occurred in both human and mouse forms, probably as the result of a point mutation. Provided that sufficient sequence information is available, point mutations can be directly and rapidly analyzed by allele-specific amplification (ASA), as this technique is sensitive enough to detect single nucleotide differences. We report the use of ASA to detect and characterize the mutation in the murine beta-globin gene, Hbb-b1d-ml, and find that the codon for beta-145 tyrosine (TAC) has been replaced by the codon for cysteine (TGC). Therefore, ENU induced an A:T --> G:C transition.									11	0	0	0	10	0	11			0006-2928			WOS:A1991HE46200009	1820025

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				123	3			1047	1056		10.1104/pp.123.3.1047				JUL 2000	2000	We report here that osmotic effects and ionic effects are both involved in the NaCl-induced inactivation of the photosynthetic machinery in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942. Incubation of the cyanobacterial cells in 0.5 M NaCl induced a rapid and reversible decline and subsequent slow and irreversible loss of the oxygen-evolving activity of photosystem (PS) II and the electron transport activity of PSI. An Na+-channel blocker protected both PSII and PSI against the slow, but not the rapid, inactivation. The rapid decline resembled the effect of 1.0 M sorbitol. The presence of both an Na+-channel blocker and a water-channel blocker protected PSI and PSII against the short- and long-term effects of NaCl. Salt stress also decreased cytoplasmic volume and this effect was enhanced by the Na+-channel blocker. Our observations suggested that NaCl had both osmotic and ionic effects. The osmotic effect decreased the amount of water in the cytosol, rapidly increasing the intracellular concentration of salts. The ionic effect was caused by an influx of Na+ ions through potassium/Na+ channels that also increased concentrations of salts in the cytosol and irreversibly inactivated PSI and PSII.									381	55	4	0	341	3	452			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000088213300028	10889254

However, it is still challenging to treat the actual complex water effluents by a single electrochemical process, often requiring coupling of technologies. In this study, an upgraded peroxi-coagulation (PC) process with a magnetically assembled mZVI/DSA anode has been devised for the first time. COD, NH3-N and total phosphorous were simultaneously and effectively removed from livestock wastewater. The advantages, influence of key parameters and evolution of electrogenerated species were systematically investigated to fully understand this novel PC process. The fluorescent substances in livestock wastewater could also be almost removed under optimal conditions (300 mA, 0.2 g ZVI particles and pH 6.8). The interaction between (OH)-O-center dot and active chlorine yielded ClO center dot with a high steady-state concentration of 6.85 x 10(-13) M, which did not cause COD removal but accelerated the oxidation of NH3-N. The Mulliken population suggested that (OH)-O-center dot and NH3-N had similar electron-donor behavior, whereas ClO center dot acted as an electron-withdrawing species. Besides, although the energy barrier for the reaction between (OH)-O-center dot and NH3-N (17.0 kcal/mol) was lower than that with ClO center dot (18.8 kcal/mol), considering the tunneling in the H abstraction reaction, the Skodje-Truhlar method adopted for calculations evidenced a 17- fold faster NH3-N oxidation rate with ClO center dot. In summary, this work describes an advantageous single electrochemical process for the effective treatment of a complex water matrix.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0045-6535	1879-1298		WOS:000833539000006	35577130

Accordingly, in previous studies, significant advances have been witnessed in the synthesis of various electrode materials with three-dimensional (3-D) structures for application in electrochemical energy storage devices. Herein, the 1-D@3-D catalyst layer design and efficient active site formation strategy help to enable an efficient Li-O-2 battery. In particular, it should be noted that the 1-D@3-D catalyst layer has great potential for maximizing the active contact area between the electrolyte and the catalyst materials and promoting the rapid diffusion of products and reactants through their stereoscopic structure. The 1-D Ru-doped CuO nanorod array on 3-D carbon cloth (Ru-CuO/RuO2@CC) is demonstrated via 7,7,8,8-Tetracyanoquinodimethane-solution deposition, and thermal oxidation process. A comprehensive kinetic study using linear sweep voltammetry reveals that the Ru-CuO/RuO2@CC has superior ORR/OER performance compared to a CuO nanorods-loaded carbon cloth and a CuO/RuO2 nanoparticles-loaded carbon cloth. The Ru-CuO/RuO2@CC as a catalyst layer combined cell is achieved 1.0 mA h cm(-2) (=3075 mA h g(c)(-1)) during 30 cycles with a low overpotential decay rate of 0.88% per cycle.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000749659600001

The route of this chemical synthesis determines the physicochemical properties of these materials. This phenomenon is clearly shown in the voltammetric current-potential characteristics of Ru-x(Xyl) and Ru-x(Dcb). Although both materials have a similar particle size, in the reduced state, Ru-x(Xyl) shows a higher electrochemical pseudocapacitance than Ru,(Dcb) by a factor of 10. However, in ambient conditions, the particles slowly oxidize to an amorphous RuxOy species. Their interfacial behavior is similar. Both species and their differences have been characterized by in situ X-ray diffraction. Samples prepared in xylene, RuxOy(Xyl), can be partly reduced in 1 bar of hydrogen at room temperature to similar to2 nm size hcp ruthenium and grown to similar to8 nm particles at 200 degreesC. In contrast, samples prepared in dichlorobenzene, RuxOy(Dcb), under the same conditions can only be reduced at 140 degreesC, to form perfect 2 nm hcp ruthenium clusters of narrow size distribution. This sample is reversibly reoxidized to the amorphous RuxOy. species at 200 degreesC in oxygen. The large 8 nm Ru particles based on the xylene preparation are, however, stable under these conditions. The driving force for such a difference in the electrochemical behavior lies on the disorder precursor state of nano-ruthenium.									25	1	0	0	0	0	25			1089-5647			WOS:000169232800023

A very small amount of 4-aminophenol is employed as reducing and N-doping agent, structure modifier and the phenolic hydroxyl source, at the same time. The electrochemical test results show that as binder-free electrode, the as-synthesized sample with high hydroxyl content (6.15 at%) exhibits an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 284.1 F g(-1) at current density of 0.3 A g(-1) in 6 M KOH electrolyte, and retains for 80.4% even at a current density of 10 A g(-1). Above all, the as assembled symmetric supercapacitor shows superior energy density of 9.9 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 75.0 W kg(-1). The significantly enhanced electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the high hydroxyl content and other oxygen functional groups, N-doping, modified porous framework and the high specific surface area of the graphene. Those special characteristics suggest that the as-synthesized graphene materials may have potential applications in high performance supercapacitors.									29	1	0	0	2	0	29			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000482496300044

To achieve quantification of hydrazine molecules by selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS), its reactions with H3O+, NO+ and O-2(+) reagent ions must be understood.Methods A SIFT study (using a SIFT-MS instrument) was carried out to obtain rate coefficients and product ions for the reactions of H3O+, NO+ and O-2(+) reagent ions with N2H4 and CH3OH molecules present in the humid headspace of their aqueous solutions. Using the kinetics data obtained, solution headspace concentrations were determined for both compounds as a function of their liquid-phase concentrations at 10, 20 and 35 degrees C.Results Both compounds react with H3O+ ions via rapid proton transfer to produce CH3OH2+ and H5N2+ ions with the common m/z value of 33. It is revealed that NO+ rapidly transfers charge to N2H4 (rate coefficient k = 2.3 x 10(-9) cm(3) s(-1)) but only slowly associates with CH3OH (k(2eff) = 7.1 x 10(-11) cm(3) s(-1)). Thus, selective analysis can be achieved using both H3O+ and NO+ reagent ions. The headspace methanol vapour concentration was found to increase with increasing solution temperature, but that of hydrazine decreased with an associated increase of ammonia (NH3) as measured with O-2(+) reagent ions.Conclusions The isobaric compounds methanol and hydrazine can be separately analysed in real time by SIFT-MS using H3O+ and NO+ reagent ions, even when they co-occur in humid air. The evolution of hydrazine from aqueous solutions can be quantitatively monitored together with its decomposition at elevated temperatures.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0951-4198	1097-0231		WOS:000529873700006	32022319

Herein, we developed a novel photocatalytic system of Au nanoparticles and carbon quantum dots loaded TiO2 nanotube array (TNTs/Au/CDs) on the surface of titanium. This system can exhibit enhanced near-infrared (NIR) light photocatalysis and photothermy because CDs can convert NIR light into the light of 500-600 nm and transfer electrons, which can inspire nano Au-catalyzed TNTs to generate ROS and enhance the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of Au nanoparticles to produce more local photothermy. The enhanced photocatalysis and local photothermy can exhibit a synergistic effect to kill the bacteria highly effectively within a very short time by damaging the membranes of the bacteria. The antibacterial efficiency of the modified surface is 96.19% and 99.89% against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia colt, respectively, under 808 nm NIR light irradiation for 15 min.

Geoffrey								Phenolic compound formation from the low temperature pyrolysis of tobacco								JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL AND APPLIED PYROLYSIS				84	2			170	178		10.1016/j.jaap.2009.01.008				MAR 2009	2009	The formation of 10 phenolic compounds (hydroquinone, resorcinol, catechol, phenol, 4-methylcatechol, 3-methylcatechol, guaiacol, o-, m-, and p-cresol) from the pyrolysis of different tobacco types at temperatures between 350 and 600 degrees C was investigated. Hydroquinone, catechol, guaiacol, 3-methylcatechol, and 4-methylcatechol were formed predominately at temperatures <= 350 degrees C from the primary decomposition of tobacco components. Cresols formed predominately between 350 and 600 degrees C and evolved from the residual solid (char) that forms at temperatures above 350 degrees C. Phenol and resorcinol were found to form over both temperature ranges, <= 350 degrees C and between 350 and 600 degrees C suggesting contributions from both the decomposition of tobacco components and the 350 degrees C residual solid. The trend in the yields of hydroquinone and catechol obtained from the tobacco types tested: bright (flue cured), burley, and oriental followed bright similar to oriental > burley. All three tobacco samples gave similar yields of phenol and cresols. Water extraction of tobacco was shown to significantly reduce the yields of phenolic compounds. The addition of 5 and 21% oxygen to the pyrolysis setup led to a significant reduction in the yields of hydroquinone and catechol but the yields of phenol and cresols remained relatively unchanged. Quinic acid and quinic acid derivatives present in tobacco are identified as important precursors of hydroquinone, catechol, and phenol. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Our results show that the buckling distortion of a CdS monolayer sheet in the CdS/InSe HSs induces a built-in polarized electric field, which significantly changes the band edge positions of the InSe layer. The band alignment indicated that the photogenerated electrons in the conduction band (CB) of the InSe monolayer have a high possibility of recombining with the holes in the valence band (VB) of the CdS sheet, resulting in the electrons in the CB of CdS participating in a reduction reaction and the holes in the VB of InSe taking part in an oxidation reaction. This direct Z-scheme photocatalytic system can lead to spatial separation of photogenerated carriers and excellent rcdox ability, thus enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency. Meanwhile, CdS/InSe HSs can significantly extend the range of light harvesting from visible light to infrared light. Similar results can also be found in the CdS/InSe@2 HSs constructed by InSe bilayer deposit on a CdS nanosheet. These results indicate that CdS/InSe HSs are promising photocatalysts for water splitting.									39	1	0	0	0	0	39			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000442636900001

An extended range for collection of extended X-ray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS) data was used (up to 16.6 angstrom(-1)). The EXAFS suggests the presence of two Mn-Mn distances close to 2.7 angstrom (per Mn4Ca complex); the existence of a third Mn-Mn distance below 2.9 angstrom is at least uncertain. Interestingly, a distance of 3.7 angstrom is clearly resolved in the extended-range data and tentatively assigned to a Mn-Mn distance. Taking into account the above EXAFS results (inter alia), we present a model for the structure of the PSII manganese complex, which differs from previous atomic-resolution models. Emphasizing the hypothetical character, we propose for all semi-stable S-states: (i) a structure of the Mn4Ca(mu-O)(n) core, (ii) a model of the amino acid environment, and (iii) assignments of distinct Mn oxidation states to all the individual Mn ions. This specific working model may permit discussion, verification and invalidation of its various features in comparison with experimental and theoretical findings.									145	2	1	0	51	0	148			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000253117000026	17989002

SARSIA				85	3			265	274		10.1080/00364827.2000.10414578				SEP 29 2000	2000	To succeed in scramble competition for food an individual fish will have to have characteristics that allow it to respond rapidly to encountered prey. A trait such as metabolic rate, which has a positive effect on oxygen consumption and growth rate, is likely to be positively correlated with the traits that determine the speed of reaction. An important factor underlying metabolic rare may be the transport efficiency of oxygen from the gills to the: respiring tissue and this is mediated by the structure of the haemoglobin molecule. In cod, two structures of this molecule exist due to polymorphism at the HbI* locus. An individual cod may be homozygous (HbI*1/1 or HbI*2/2) or heterozygous (HbI*1/2). Evidence exists in the literature that HbI*2/2 fish have higher growth rate and earlier maturation and higher transport efficiency of oxygen at low temperature. However, no study has examined whether this could be associated with fish behaviour. In a study reported here we designed an experiment to test the hypothesis that fish with the HbI*2/2 genotype have a higher motivation to feed and are better competitors than individuals with the other haemoglobin genotypes and that they will eat a larger share of the prey. We use prey capture success early in a feeding trial and the rank of the first prey taken, as proxy variables for competitive performance. Randomly chosen one-year-old cod Gadus morhua L. in small groups were tested experimentally for individual responses to prey offered sequentially. We analysed the effect on competitive performance of haemoglobin genotype, group, fish size, sex, maturation status and unobserved effects using Components of Variance Analysis, which accounts for repeated observations from the same individuals. The most successful fish were usually among the first to feed and tended to possess haemoglobin genotype HbI*2/2. Other factors such as body size, sex, stage of maturation and group also had effects which may modify the effect set by genotype. Our results suggest that the link between HbI* genotype and growth is through feeding behaviour and it supports the idea that fish with HbI*2/2 genotype are better able to support an active metabolism. The results obtained are among the first on fish that show that variation in feeding behaviour could be under genetic control.									27	0	0	0	26	0	28			0036-4827			WOS:000090010900010

The deposit is hosted by volcanic rocks of the Middle Devonian Beitashan Formation. In this study, four hypogene hydrothermal alteration stages have been identified, including the Ca-silicate alteration (Stage I), amphibole-epidote-magnetite alteration/mineralization (Stage II), pyrite-chalcopyrite mineralization (Stage III) and late hydrothermal veining (Stage IV).Mineralogical, fluid inclusion (including laser Raman spectroscopy) and mineral sulfur, oxygen-hydrogen and carbon isotope analyses were carried out to elucidate the nature and origin of the hydrothermal fluids at Laoshankou: Stage I hydrothermal fluids were likely derived from a similar to 590 degrees C magmatic fluid with delta O-18(water) = 9.2-9.7 parts per thousand. Subsequently, the magnetite-epidote-amphibole assemblage may have precipitated from the fluids (similar to 530 degrees C) formed by the mixing of high-temperature magmatic fluids with the seawater that reacted with O-18-rich wall-rocks. The fluid-rock reactions are reflected from the delta O-18(water) (9.6-10.7%o) and delta D-water (-25.5-23.8 parts per thousand) values. The sub-economic Stage III-A (pyrite-epidote-quartz-garnet) mineralization likely occurred at similar to 415 degrees C, and was formed by fluids with delta S-34(fluid) = -3.7- -0.5 parts per thousand, delta D-water = -110- -94 parts per thousand, and delta O-18(water) = 7.92-8.9 parts per thousand. The lower temperature and presence of organic matter of the Stage III-A fluids may have reflected the involvement of meteoric water and organic matter from the wall rocks. The economic Cu mineralization (Stage III-B) was probably formed by the mixing of a meteoric water-dominated fluid (medium temperature, low salinity and Na-dominated) and a Ca-rich formation water in equilibrium with the volcanic wall rocks (medium temperature, medium salinity and Ca-/Fe-Mg-dominated), with delta S-34(fluid) = -2.6 parts per thousand, delta O-18(water) = 5.6-5.8 parts per thousand, delta C-13(water) = -3.3- -3.1 parts per thousand, and delta D-waier = -92- -95 parts per thousand. Towards the end of the fluid evolution, meteoric water incursion may have continued and generated the ore-barren low-temperature, low salinity, and Na-dominated fluids. Although the Laoshankou deposit contains distinct skarn alteration, the ore mineral assemblage and ore fluid features indicate that it is not a typical skarn deposit, but share many similarities with many Central Andean IOCG deposits. We conclude that the IOCG ore-forming setting in the Devonian East Junggar was analogous to the Cretaceous Central Andes, in that they both occurred during basin inversion in a volcanic arc setting.									10	4	0	0	0	0	12			0169-1368	1872-7360		WOS:000460710600035

Some of these chloroplast proteins have documented roles in chlorophyll biosynthesis (CAO) and degradation (PAO and TIC55), whereas the function of PTC52 remains unresolved. Biochemical evidence provided here identifies PTC52 as Pchlide a oxygenase of the inner plastid envelope linking Pchlide b synthesis to pPORA import. Protochlorophyllide b is the preferred substrate of PORA and its lack no longer allows pPORA import. The Pchlide b-dependent import pathway of pPORA thus operates in etiolated seedlings and is switched off during greening. Using dexamethasone-induced RNA interference (RNAi) we tested if PTC52 is involved in controlling both, pPORA import and Pchlide homeostasis in planta. As shown here, RNAi plants deprived of PTC52 transcript and PTC52 protein were unable to import pPORA and died as a result of excess Pchlide a accumulation causing singlet oxygen formation during greening. In genetic studies, no homozygous ptc52 knock-out mutants could be obtained presumably as a result of embryo lethality, suggesting a role for PTC52 in the initial greening of plant embryos. Phylogenetic studies identified PTC52-like genes amongst unicellular photosynthetic bacteria and higher plants, suggesting that the biochemical function associated with PTC52 may have an ancient evolutionary origin. PTC52 also harbors conserved motifs with bacterial oxygenases such as the terminal oxygenase component of 3-ketosteroid 9-alpha-hydroxylase (KshA) from Rhodococcus rhodochrous. 3D-modeling of PTC52 structure permitted the prediction of amino acid residues that contribute to the substrate specificity of this enzyme. In vitro-mutagenesis was used to test the predicted PTC52 model and provide insights into the reaction mechanism of this Rieske non-heme oxygenase.									4	0	0	0	2	0	4			1664-462X			WOS:000468129000001	31156665

These intriguing properties render 2D/2D nanostructures highly auspicious in a multitude of photocatalytic energy applications, including water splitting for H-2 oxygen (O-2) evolution, reduction of CO2, and N-2 fixation. As such, this leads to the development of clean energy technology by 2D/2D catalysts and solar energy as the inexhaustible energy resource. Herein, the fundamental principles of 2D/2D hybrid heterostructures and diverse types of interfaces with different material families are systematically discussed. Furthermore, photocatalytic energy applications using 2D/2D heterointerfaces over the recent years are highlighted. Insights into the interplay of 2D/2D heterojunction interfaces and the associated physicochemical properties (e.g., charge carrier dynamics) toward the photocatalytic enhancement are put forward. Last but not least, the challenges and prospects in engineering 2D/2D heterostructure photocatalysts for affordable and clean energy advancements are reviewed, which serve as a guiding star not only in photocatalysis, but also in other applications in the energy realm such as fuel cells, batteries, supercapacitors, and photovoltaics.									73	6	0	0	6	0	73			2367-198X			WOS:000561332200006

The citrate-stabilized IrO2 colloid was self-assembled onto an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode to form a monolayer of the colloidal IrO2 particles when it was dipped in the colloid solution. The self-assembly could be achieved by a chemical interaction between carboxylate groups on the citrate stabilizer and hydroxyl groups on the ITO surface to form ester bonds. Efficient electrocatalysis for water oxidation was demonstrated using the electrode modified by the self-assembled IrO2 colloid to yield the highest turnover frequency ((2.3-2.5) x 10(4) h(-1)) of IrO2 in the hitherto-reported catalysts for electrochemical water oxidation.									164	5	0	0	15	0	169			1520-6106			WOS:000233437100005	16853788

Experimentally, after the SnO2-Sb-Ce (SSC) composite was electrodeposited for 120s on the titanium substrate in aqueous solution, the outer thermal coatings composed of SSC were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. Both influences of electrodeposition time (T-ed) and thermal decomposition time (T-td) were investigated to obtain the optimum preparation. It was found that when increasing T-ed to a certain extent a longer lifetime of electrode can be achieved, which was attributed to a more solid interlayer structure. A notable SSCTTed,(Ttd) electrode, i.e., SSCT3,10, which was prepared through three times of 120 s' electrodeposition (T-ed = 3) and ten times of thermal decomposition (T-td = 10) obtained the highest oxygen evolution potential 3.141 V vs. SCE. In this selected electrode, when 10 mg.L-1 initial TC concentration was added to this wastewater, the highest color removal efficiency and mineralization rate of TC were 72.4% and 41.6%, respectively, with an applied electridty density of 20 mA.cm(-2) and treatment time of 1 h. These results presented here demonstrate that the combined application of electrodeposition and thermal decomposition is effective in realization of enhanced electrocatalytic oxidation activity.

It occurs when large numbers of white blood cells are activated and release inflammatory cytokines, in turn activating even more white blood cells, finally resulting in an exaggerated pro-inflammatory-mediated response and ineffective anti-inflammatory control, leading to tissue damage, multiorgan failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. Although cytokine storm pathogenesis is multifactorial, we hypothesize there is a close association between hypoxemia and cytokine storms in COVID-19, although it is difficult to establish the direction of this relationship. Most probably they coexist and, given enough time, one triggers the other in a chain reaction. Careful analysis of the day-to-day clinical evolution of COVID-19 indicates that there are short and slight periods of hypoxemia (confirmed by pulse oximetry and arterial gasometry), even on the day of the onset of persistent cough and/or shortness of breath.We propose the use of continuous positive airway pressure in early stages of COVID-19, at the onset of respiratory symptoms. This non-invasive ventilation method may be useful in individualized treatments to prevent early hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients and thus avoid triggering a cytokine storm.We believe such an approach is relevant everywhere, and in Cuba in particular, since the country has initiated national production of mechanical ventilation systems, including non-invasive ventilators. Moreover, as Cuba's COVID-19 protocols ensure early patient admission to isolation centers or hospitals, clinicians can prescribe the early use of continuous positive airway pressure as soon as respiratory symptoms begin, averting early hypoxemia and its triggering effect on cytokine storm development, and consequently, avoiding acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, and death.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1555-7960			WOS:000687800200008	34516537

The structural evolution of the vitreous network was monitored as a function of composition by thermal analysis, Raman spectroscopy and high resolution one- and two-dimensional P-31 solid state NMR. Addition of WO3 to the NaPO3 glass melt leads to a pronounced increase in the glass transition temperatures, suggesting a significant increase in network connectivity. At the same time Raman spectra indicate that up to about 30 mol% WO3 the tungsten atoms are linked to some non-bridging oxygen atoms (W-O- or W=O bonded species), suggesting that the network modifier sodium oxide is shared to some extent between both network formers. W-O- W bond formation occurs only at WO3 contents exceeding 30 mol%. P-31 magic angle spinning (MAS)-NMR spectra, supported by two-dimensional J-resolved spectroscopy, allow a clear distinction between species having two, one, and zero P-O-P linkages. The possible formation of some anionic tungsten sites suggested from the Raman data implies an average increase in the degree of polymerization for the phosphorus species, which would result in diminished P-31/Na-23 interactions. This prediction is indeed confirmed by P-31{Na-23} and Na-23{P-31} rotational echo double resonance (REDOR) NMR results, which indicate that successive addition of WO3 to NaPO3 glass significantly diminishes the strength of phosphorus-sodium dipole-dipole couplings.									70	1	0	0	0	0	70			0959-9428			WOS:000239639500003

The spectrum evolved dramatically, changing from a quasi-photospheric stellar spectrum with weak atomic emission lines (some with P Cygni profiles) to one showing a wide range of deep absorption features indicative of a cool, extended atmosphere with a circumstellar dust shell. The early spectra showed lines of s-process elements, such as Sr II and Ba I. The later spectra showed absorption by gaseous H2O, CO, AlO, TiO, SiO, SO2, OH, VO, and SH, as well as a complex of emission near 10 mum reminiscent of silicate emission, with a central absorbing feature at 10.3 mum. Thus, V838 Mon appears to be oxygen-rich. A simple, spherically symmetric model of the system involving a central star with a two-component expanding circumstellar shell is presented that is able to explain the major molecular features and spectral energy distribution in the object's late stages. The derived shell mass and distance are 0.04 M. and 9.2 kpc, respectively.									38	0	2	0	0	1	40			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000221523900040		
J	Jun, X; Yang, CS; Jang, HR; Choi, CK								Chemical structure evolution of SiOCH films with low dielectric constant during PECVD and postannealing								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				150	12			F206	F210		10.1149/1.1621878				DEC 2003	2003	SiOCH films with low dielectric constant were deposited on p-Si(100) substrates using inductively coupled plasma chemical vapor deposition with a mixture of bis-trimethylsilymethane (BTMSM) precursor and oxygen gases. The chemical structure of the SiOCH films deposited at different conditions such as discharge power, BTMSM/O-2 flow rate ratio, and postannealing temperature was studied by Fourier transform infrared spectra. The characterization results indicate that there are at least two ways for C atoms to incorporate into the SiOCH films during deposition. One way is by -CH3 groups attached to Si atoms in Si-O-Si networks, which was caused by a polymerization mechanism, and another is by Si-O-C substructure, which was caused by an oxidation mechanism. The former was the main film growth mechanism when radio frequency (rf) power was lower and the later became dominant while rf power was increased. The transformation of open-linked Si-O-C substructure to ring-linked Si-O-C substructure and the elimination of -OH group were the main reasons of dielectric constant decrease during postannealing procedures. The lowest relative dielectric constant of the film was about 2.1, which was deposited at rf power of 200 W with the BTMSM:O-2 flow rate ratio of 10 sccm: 10 sccm.

Herein, we fabricated a novel Ni3S2/Ni(OH)(2) dual-functional electrocatalyst by a one-step fast electrodeposition on nickel foam (NF). While maintaining the electrocatalytic performance of Ni3S2, the existence of heterostructure and Ni(OH)(2) co-catalyst function greatly improves the overall water splitting performance of Ni3S2/Ni(OH)(2)-NF. Hence, It shows a low overpotential of 66 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and 249 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) for OER. The dual-functional electrocatalyst needs only 1.58 V at 20 mA cm(-2) when assembled two-electrode electrolytic cell. Impressively, the electrocatalyst also shows outstanding catalytic stability for about 800 h when 20 and 50 mA cm(-2) constant current was applied, respectively which demonstrates a potential electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.

Mixtures contained a C source (methanol, acetone or other ketones), a N source (ammonia or methylamine), and an O source (water) at various molar ratios of C:H:N:O. When subjected to UV light or heated for periods of 7 to 45 days under an argon atmosphere, they yielded a narrow product distribution of a few principal compounds. Different initial conditions produced different distributions. The nature of the products was ascertained by gas chromatographic-mass spectral analysis (GC-MS). UVC irradiation of an aqueous methanol-ammonia-water prebiotic mixture for 14 days under low UV dose (6 x 10(-2) Einstein) produced methylisourea, hexamethylenetetramine (HMT), methyl-HMT and hydroxy-HMT, whereas under high UV dose (45 days; 1.9 x 10(-1) Einstein) yielded only HMT. By contrast, the prebiotic mixture composed of acetone-ammonia-water produced five principal species with acetamide as the major component; thermally the same mixture produced a different product distribution of four principal species. UVC irradiation of the CH3CN-NH3-H2O prebiotic mixture for 7 days gave mostly trimethyl-s-triazine, whereas in the presence of two metal oxides (TiO2 or Fe2O3) also produced some HMT; the thermal process yielded only acetamide.									11	0	0	0	4	0	11			1474-905X	1474-9092		WOS:000250589200019	17973054

Photosynthesis in the Archean Era								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				88	2			109	117		10.1007/s11120-006-9040-5				MAY 2006	2006	The earliest reductant for photosynthesis may have been H-2. The carbon isotope composition measured in graphite from the 3.8-Ga Isua Supercrustal Belt in Greenland is attributed to H-2-driven photosynthesis, rather than to oxygenic photosynthesis as there would have been no evolutionary pressure for oxygenic photosynthesis in the presence of H-2. Anoxygenic photosynthesis may also be responsible for the filamentous mats found in the 3.4-Ga Buck Reef Chert in South Africa. Another early reductant was probably H2S. Eventually the supply of H-2 in the atmosphere was likely to have been attenuated by the production of CH4 by methanogens, and the supply of H2S was likely to have been restricted to special environments near volcanos. Evaporites, possible stromatolites, and possible microfossils found in the 3.5-Ga Warrawoona Megasequence in Australia are attributed to sulfur-driven photosynthesis. Proteobacteria and protocyanobacteria are assumed to have evolved to use ferrous iron as reductant sometime around 3.0 Ga or earlier. This type of photosynthesis could have produced banded iron formations similar to those produced by oxygenic photosynthesis. Microfossils, stromatolites, and chemical biomarkers in Australia and South Africa show that cyanobacteria containing chlorophyll a and carrying out oxygenic photosynthesis appeared by 2.8 Ga, but the oxygen level in the atmosphere did not begin to increase until about 2.3 Ga.									140	9	0	0	107	1	152			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000238151700002	16453059

Here, a facile process is developed for preparing a new type of low-cost ferrite phosphate as an efficient co-catalyst to suppress charge recombination and stabilize bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) photoelectrodes. The composite photoanode exhibits a high photocurrent density of 2.28 mAcm(-2), which corresponds to a 250% increase compared to that of pristine BiVO4. Deposition of cocatalyst has yielded a large cathodic shift (similar to 500 mV) in the onset potential, high hole oxidation efficiency of about 90%. The Fe-Pi/BiVO4 photoanode demonstrates an impressive performance of photostability and attains a stable photocurrent density for more than 2 h at 1.23 V-RHE without declining. Comprehensive photoelectrochemical studies suggest that ferrite phosphate could boost the photoelectrochemical properties of the BiVO4 underlayer by mediating hole extraction across the photoexcited semiconductor-electrolyte interface. This in turn enhances photoconversion efficiency and prevents the photooxidation of the photoanode, ensuring prolonged stability. The results provide deeper understanding of the role of cocatalyst nanostructures decorated with semiconductors in solar water splitting.									33	1	0	0	4	0	32			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000453616800067

The method consists of measuring the contact electroresistance between two identical metallic specimens, periodically contacted in electrolyte under potentiostatic control, in particular, between the walls of a fatigue crack in a sample cyclically loaded below the corrosion fatigue crack growth threshold. The sensitivity of the method is 10(-9) Ohm and it can be used for all conducting materials in any electrolyte at ambient and high temperatures and pressures in a wide region of potentials including the potentials of intensive evolution of hydrogen or oxygen. The method allows the electroresistance of films on metals to be determined at very early stages of water and anion adsorption, formation and destruction of hydride and oxide films, electrochemical incorporation of cations, electrodeposition of metals and to study the kinetics of these processes. The water adsorption potentials meant to characterize quantitatively the hydrophility of metals have been specified for 16 metals.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			0010-938X			WOS:A1996TY37700012

Herein, a facile hydrothermal method is used to engineer the stacked flower-like NiTe-NiSe nanosheets, thus nearing the application of transition metal telluride in clean and renewable energy field. Thanks to the hollow flower-shaped catalyst assembled with nanosheets, the active surface area of the optimized electrode material is 20 times larger than that of a single NiTe/NFF or NiSe/NFF, causing low overpotentials for delivering a current density of 10 mA cm-2 (j10) in the hydrogen (HER, 76 mV) and oxygen (OER, 164 mV) evolution processes. The OER activity of NiTe-NiSe/NFF exceeds that of benchmarked RuO2 even at moderate current densities above j115. Based on the results of experiments and DFT calculations, the unexpected high catalytic performance of NiTe-NiSe/NFF is attributed to the formed heterointerfaces and mismatched crystal lattice of NiTe, which effectively optimize the electronic structure through the phase synergy and cause a low adsorption free energy for the reactive intermediates.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000810313000003		
J	Xu-Hao; Yan-Wei								Studies on the preparation of high efficient Ti/PbO2 electrode and degradation of acid red G								China Environmental Science				37	7			2591	8						20 July 2017	2017	A novel Ti/PbO2 electrode was synthesized through electro-codeposition technology by using dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (DTAC) as an additive. Its characteristics were examined by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and accelerated life test etc. Electro-catalytic oxidation experiments were carried out to evaluate the effect of DTAC on the electorde's electrochemical activity. Acid red G (ARG, C18H13N3Na2O8S2, CAS number: 3734-67-6) was chosen as the model contaminant due to its extensive industrial usage. After DTAC modification, the predominant phase of the electrode was still pure beta-PbO2. However, DTAC could refine the electrode surface leading to a high electrode specific surface area and oxygen evolution potential (OEP, 1.886V) and a low electrode film impedance (55.7 Omega/cm2). The ARG electrocatalytic degradation and accelerated life tests revealed that the electrocatalytic ability and stability of the modified electrode were much higher compared to that of PbO2electrode. Among these novel electrodes, the PbO2-DTAC (0.5) exhibited the highest electrocatalytic ability for ARG degradation with a decolorization percentage of 86.8% within 60 min. Moreover, its stability was the highest with a long accelerated service life of 232.5 h, which was more than 2 times longer than that of PbO2 electrode (96 h).									0	5	0	0	0	0	5			1000-6923			INSPEC:17762992

For instance, BiVO4 exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity when Pt cocatalyst was selectively modified on the (010) facet of BiVO4 single-crystal photocatalyst with exposed (010) and (110) facets. In view of the high cost and rarity of metallic Pt, it was desirable to discover low-cost electron cocatalysts that show comparable activity with Pt. In the study, Ag2O-Ag as a novel and highly efficient electron cocatalyst was selectively modified on the (010) facet of single-crystal BiVO4 photocatalyst via facile photodeposition of metallic Ag and its subsequent partial oxidation to Ag2O via low-temperature calcination (100-400 C). In detail, Ag was selectively modified on the electron-rich (010) facet of BiVO4 single crystal, while Ag2O was selectively formed on the Ag surface, resulting in the formation of Ag2O-Ag/BiVO4 photocatalyst. As a result, Ag2O-Ag/BiVO, exhibited nearly comparable activity with Pt/BiVO4, but clearly higher activity than Ag/BiVO4 or BiVO4 alone. The enhanced performance was ascribed to the synergistic effect of crystal facet engineering of BiVO4 and selective modification of Ag2O-Ag electron cocatalyst. In detail, the single crystal structure of BiVO4 results in the orientation transport of photogenerated carriers, while metallic Ag effectively transfers photogenerated electrons of BiVO4 and then, Ag2O as the active site accelerates the reduction of dissolved oxygen. Considering that our present synthetic strategy is facile, controllable and economical, this study provides insight into the design and synthesis of highly efficient semiconductor photocatalysts.									47	9	0	0	4	0	47			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000431688100015	29664485	
J	Landis, GP; Rye, RO								Characterization of gas chemistry and noble-gas isotope ratios of inclusion fluids in magmatic-hydrothermal and magmatic-steam alunite								CHEMICAL GEOLOGY				215	1-4			155	184		10.1016/j.chemgeo.2004.06.037				FEB 15 2005	2005	Chemical and isotope data were obtained for the active gas and noble gas of inclusion fluids in coarse-grained samples of magmatic-hydrothermal and magmatic-steam alunite from well-studied deposits (Marysvale, Utah; Tambo, Chile; Tapajos, Brazil; Cactus, California; Pierina, Peru), most of which are discussed in this Volume. Primary fluid inclusions in the alunite typically are less than 0.2 mu m but range up to several micrometers. Analyses of the active-gas composition of these alunite-hosted inclusion fluids released in vacuo by both crushing and heating indicate consistent differences in the compositions of magmatic-hydrothermal and magmatic-steam fluids. The compositions of fluids released by crushing were influenced by contributions from significant populations of secondary inclusions that trapped largely postdepositional hydrothermal fluids. Thermally released fluids gave the best representation of the fluids that formed primary alunite. The data are consistent with current models for the evolution of magmatic-hydrothermal and magmatic-steam fluids. Magmatic-steam fluids are vapor-dominant, average about 49 mol% H2O, and contain N-2, H-2, CH4, CO, Ar, He, HF, and HCl with SO2 the dominant sulfur gas (average SO2/H2S = 202). In contrast, magmatic-hydrothermal fluids are liquid-dominant, average about 88 mol% H2O, and contain N-2, H-2, CO2, and HF, with H2S about as abundant as SO2 (average SO2/H2S = 0.7). The low SO2/H2S and N-2/Ar ratios, and the near-absence of He in magmatic-hydrothermal fluids, are consistent with their derivation from degassed condensed magmatic fluids whose evolution from reduced-to-oxidized aqueous sulfur species was governed first by rock and then by fluid buffers. The high SO2/H2S and N-2/Ar with significant concentrations of He in magmatic-steam fluids are consistent with derivation directly from it magma. None of the data supports the entrainment of atmospheric gases or mixing of air-saturated gases in meteoric water in either magmatic-hydrothermal or magmatic-steam fluids. Thus, the oxidation of SO2 to aqueous sulfate in the magmatic-steam fluids did not result from mixing with atmospheric oxygen. Both of the fluid types are characterized by high H2 contents that range from 0.2 mol% to the extraordinarily large amounts (66 mol%) observed in some magmatic-steam fluids. Modeling of gas speciation using SOLVGAS requires most of the gas species to have been in disequilibrium at the time of their trapping in the fluid inclusions. The origin of such extreme H-2 concentrations, although problematic, is thought to be largely related to accumulation of H-2 from the reaction of water with ferrous iron during the rise of magma and probably even after exsolution of fluid from a magma. The large contents of reduced gases in the inclusion fluids are far in excess of those observed in volcanic emanations, and are thought to reflect the close "sampling position" of the host alunite relative to the location of the magma. Isotope ratios of He and Ne indicate largely crustal sources for these gases in the alunite parental fluids derived from Tertiary magmas, but a greater mantle component for the gases in alunite parental fluids derived from Proterozoic magmas.

The chemical states of Mo, O and S have been identified from their core level binding energies, whereas the Delta Phi variation reflects changes in the work function during formation of the films. Oxidation by O-2 at 400 degrees C produces an oxygen-deficient MoO3 film which is further transformed by immersion in water with the formation of lower Mo oxidation states (mainly Mo-IV and Mo-III). Direct immersion of the metal in water results in the progressive growth of a highly hydroxylated and hydrated oxide film with the predominance of a MoO2 structure after prolonged immersion. Thick Mo sulphide films (thickness > 112 Angstrom) are obtained by immersion of the foil in a thiomolybdate solution and further UHV annealing or by H2S sulphidation of the preoxidized metal. In the sulphided films, the presence of both S2- and S-2(2-) species has been detected, the distribution of which influences the Delta Phi variation according to: Delta Phi (mV) = 550 - 13.75[S-2(2-)(%)]. It has also been found that the Delta Phi values of the films decrease in the order: Delta Phi[MoO3] > Delta Phi[MoS2] > Delta Phi[MoS3] > Delta Phi[Mo-0].

Firstly, one monolayer of ruthenium was deposited on the substrate and over it a 1.1 layer of metallic platinum. In the blank solution it was observed that the electrochemical behavior of both the Pt/Ru/Pt and bulk Pt were very similar, except in the oxygen evolution potential region. Using X-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy (XPS) it was not possible to identify the presence of Ru atoms on the bilayer surface. The electroactive area and the RMS roughness factor measured with atomic force microscopy (AFM) for both materials are the same. A CO monolayer oxidation procedure confirmed that the systems have the same real surface area and also showed a shift in the negative direction for 54 mV on the CO peak potential for the bilayer. For the voltammetric organic molecules oxidation, an enhancement in the current densities of 350, 390 and 420% was observed for ethanol, methanol and formic acid, respectively, for the bilayer system compared to the bulk Pt electrodes. Also, a decrease of I 10 mV in the beginning of the ethanol oxidation process was observed over the bilayer system compared to bulk Pt. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The intermediate products are characterized by chemical analysis, diffuse reflectance Fourier transform IR spectroscopy (DRIFTS), Raman spectroscopy, and Si-29 and C-13 magic-angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR. Spectroscopic characterization indicates that the 1400 degrees C pyrolysis products are amorphous silicon nitride mixed with amorphous and graphitic carbon (as determined by Raman spectroscopy), rather than silicon carbide nitride, as expected based on the presence of up to 20 mol% retained carbon. Efforts to crystallize the silicon nitride through heat treatments up to 1400 degrees C do not lead to any crystalline phases, as established by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and small-area electron diffraction (SAD). It appears that the presence of free carbon, along with the absence of oxygen, strongly inhibits crystallization of amorphous silicon nitride, These results contrast with the isostructural poly(Si-methylsilazane), -[MeHSiNH](x)-, which is reported to form silicon carbide nitride on pyrolysis.									52	0	0	0	4	0	52			0002-7820			WOS:A1995QD72000021

The method not only provides g-C3N4 with porous structure and Co-N bonds that accelerate photoexcited carrier transfer and endow numerous active sites, but also redshifts the g-C3N4 absorption edge into near-infrared (NIR) light region through the introduction of nitrogen defects and thus is suitable for H-2 evolution. The g-C3N4-Co-K exhibits significantly superior photocatalytic hydrogen generation performance (808 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) under simulated solar light irradiation, about 15.5 times higher than pure g-C3N4, about 5.2 times higher than g-C3N4 with Co-N bonds (g-C3N4-Co), and about 2.1 times higher than g-C3N4 with nitrogen defects (g-C3N4-K). Interestingly, it is for the first time revealed that the synergistic effect of nitrogen defects and Co-N bonds result in enhanced H-2 generation activity (470 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) under NIR light irradiation.

The main mechanisms of immune evasion employed by fish parasites are reviewed and considered under ten headings. 1) Parasite isolation: parasites develop in immuno-privileged host tissues, such as brain, gonads, or eyes, where host barriers prevent or limit the immune response. 2) Host isolation: the host cellular immune response isolates and encapsulates the parasites in a dormant stage without killing them. 3) Intracellular disguise: typical of intracellular microsporidians, coccidians and some myxosporeans. 4) Parasite migration, behavioural and environmental strategies: parasites migrate to host sites the immune response has not yet reached or where it is not strong enough to kill them, or they accommodate their life cycles to the season or the age in which the host immune system is down-regulated. 5) Antigen-based strategies such as mimicry or masking, variation and sharing of parasite antigens. 6) Anti-immune mechanisms: these allow parasites to resist innate humoral factors, to neutralize host antibodies or to scavenge reactive oxygen species within macrophages. 7) Immunodepression: parasites either suppress the fish immune systems by reducing the proliferative capacity of lymphocytes or the phagocytic activity of macrophages, or they induce apoptosis of host leucocytes. 8) Immunomodulation: parasites secrete or excrete substances which modulate the secretion of host immune factors, such as cytokines, to their own benefit. 9) Fast development: parasites proliferate faster than the ability of the host to mount a defence response. 10) Exploitation of the host immune reaction. Knowledge of the evasion strategies adopted by parasites will help us to understand host-parasite interactions and may therefore help in the discovery of novel immunotherapeutic agents or targeted vaccines, and permit the selection of host-resistant strains.

One is an ionic liquid composed of cations with N-P-O bond, namely, tri(N,N-dimethylamino)-n-butoxyphosphonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide (TABP-TFSA) and has a relatively low viscosity (38 mPa s at 30 degrees C) due to the high internal mobility of the cation, despite its large ion size. TABP-TFSA showed a characteristic electrochemical oxidation behavior, such as a wide electrochemical potential window of stability without gas evolution. Formation of passivation film on a Pt electrode was suggested from the results of potential sweep experiments. The lithium secondary battery ([LiCoO2|Li] cell) using TABP-TFSA as the electrolyte achieved stable charge-discharge operations in over 500 cycles. For another ionic liquid with N-P bond, namely, TAEP-TFSA (TAEP(+) = tri(N-methyl-N-(n-butylamino))ethylphosphonium), less battery cycle stability and low rate performances were observed, despite the higher ionic dissociation than TABP-TFSA, probably because of the high viscosity and low electrochemical oxidative stability. It is shown that the introduction of oxygen in the cation like N-P-O produces better performances compared with the cation having N-P structure. (C) 2011 The Electrochemical Society.

Contrary to 1-zone chemical evolution models, we are able to resolve local inhomogeneities in the ISM caused by single core-collapse supernovae. These inhomogeneities lead to different element abundance patterns in very metal-poor stars, which can be seen as scatter in the abundances of halo stars with metallicities [Fe/H] < 2.0.The early chemical evolution of the halo proceeds in different enrichment phases: At [Fe/H] < -3.0, the halo ISM is unmixed and dominated by local inhomogeneities caused by individual core-collapse supernova (SN) events. For metallicities [Fe/H] > -2.0 the halo ISM is well mixed, showing an element abundance pattern integrated over the initial mass function. In the range -3.0 < [Fe/H] < -2.0 a continuous transition from the unmixed to the well mixed ISM occurs.For some elements (Si, Ca, Eu), the scatter in the element-to-iron ratio [El/Fe] of metal-poor halo stars can be reproduced. Stellar yields of other elements predict a scatter which, compared to the observations, is too large (O, Mg) or too small (Ni). Cr and Mn show a decreasing trend for lower metallicities, which can not be explained by metallicity independent yields, provided that the mixing of the ejecta with the interstellar medium does not depend on progenitor mass. This demonstrates the need for revised, self-consistent SN yields.Finally, we discuss the metallicity distribution in the model. Compared to the 28 very metal-poor stars observed with metallicities in the range -4.0 < [Fe/H] < -3.0, no star is known with confirmed metallicity [Fe/H] < -4.0, while our model predicts 5 +/- 2 stars with [Fe/H] < -4.0. These should be present if the halo ISM started at primordial metallicities and no preenrichment by population III stars occurred.									135	0	0	0	0	0	135			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000087446700015

The microstructure, element distribution, crystal structure and chemical composition of samples were characterized by the analytical techniques including SEM, EDS, XRD and XPS. The electrochemical performances of electrodes were evaluated using LSV and CV measurements. The center dot OH radicals generation capacity of electrodes was determined using terephthalic acid as trapping agent. Moreover, the PbO2/SnO2 electrodes were applied in the electrochemical degradation of 3-CP in aqueous solution. The results show that the doping of SnO2 nanoparticles reduced the grain size of PbO2 crystal and improved the content of Oads on the surface of electrode. In contrast with the pure PbO2 electrode, the PbO2/SnO2-1.0 electrode (the concentration of SnO2 in electroplating solution was 1.0 g/L) exhibited higher oxygen evolution potential, stronger direct oxidation capacity and center dot OH radicals generation capacity, and superior electrochemical activity for degradation of 3-CP. The intermediates formed in electrochemical degradation of 3-CP were revealed by HPLC and a plausible degradation pathway was proposed. Furthermore, PbO2/SnO2-1.0 electrode also showed a high reusability for 3-CP degradation.									39	1	0	0	16	0	39			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000487838900026		
J	Trittschack, Roy; Grobety, Bernard; Koch-Mueller, Monika								In situ high-temperature Raman and FTIR spectroscopy of the phase transformation of lizardite								AMERICAN MINERALOGIST				97	11-12			1965	1976		10.2138/am.2012.4162				NOV-DEC 2012	2012	A temperature-dependent in situ micro-FTIR and micro-Raman spectroscopic investigation was performed on powdered (FTIR, Raman) and single-crystal (Raman) lizardite-1T samples between room temperature and 819 degrees C. Between room temperature and 665 degrees C, the OH stretching bands shift to lower wavenumbers, demonstrating a weak expansion of the O3-H3 center dot center dot center dot O2 interlayer distance. Band deconyolution of FTIR and Raman spectra at room temperature show differences in the number of bands in the OH stretching region with respect to group theory: four (FTIR) and six (Raman) OH stretching bands, respectively. This number reduces to four (Raman) at non-ambient temperatures either caused by LO-TO splitting, the presence of non-structural OH species or the presence of different lizardite polytypes and/or serpentine polymorphs as well as defects. During dehydroxylation, the evolution of the integrated intensity of the OH bands suggests a transport of hydrogen and oxygen as individual ions/molecule or OH-. A significant change in Raman spectra occurs between 639 and 665 degrees C with most lizardite peaks disappearing contemporaneously with the appearance of forsterite-related features and new, non-forsterite bands at 183, 350, and 670 cm(-1). A further band appears at 1000 cm(-1) at 690 degrees C. The long stability of Si-O-related bands indicates a delayed decomposition of the tetrahedral sheet with respect to the dehydroxylation of the octahedral sheet. Moreover, evidence for a small change in the ditrigonal distortion angle during heating is given. In general, all appearing non-forsterite-related frequencies are similar to Raman data of talc and this indicates the presence of a talc-like intermediate.									32	5	0	0	3	0	35			0003-004X			WOS:000311066600017

Herein, a voltage-gauged electrofiltration method was demonstrated to synthesize single-atom site catalysts at room temperature. Under regulation of the graphene oxide membrane, a bulk Fe plate was directly converted into Fe single atoms, and the diffusion rate of Fe ions was greatly reduced, resulting in an ultralow concentration of Fe2+ around the working electrode, which successfully prevented the growing of nuclei and aggregating of metal atoms. Monatomic Fe atoms are homogeneously anchored on the as-prepared nitrogen-doped carbon. Owing to the fast photoelectron injection from photosensitizers to atomically dispersed Fe sites through the highly conductive supported N-C, the Fe-SAs/N-C exhibits an outstanding photocatalytic activity toward CO2 aqueous reduction into syngas with a tunable CO/H-2 ratio under visible light irradiation. The gas evolution rates for CO and H-2 are 4500 and 4950 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), respectively, and the tunable CO/H-2 ratio is from 0.3 to 8.8. This article presents an efficient strategy to develop the single-atom site catalysts and bridges the gap between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts toward photocatalytic CO2 aqueous reduction into syngas.									41	6	0	0	2	0	40			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000537682300099	32379422

An investigation of the effect of RuO2 on the deactivation and corrosion mechanism of a Ti/IrO2 + Ta2O5 coating in an OER application								JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				777				67	74		10.1016/j.jelechem.2016.07.036				SEP 15 2016	2016	This article describes the investigation into the effect of RuO2 on the deactivation and corrosion mechanism of Ti/IrO2 + Ta2O5 coating in a sodium sulphate solution. Mixed metal oxide coatings within the composition, included in IrO2 + RuO2 + Ta2O5 with different percentages of RuO2 (10, 30 and 50 wt.%) on the titanium substrate, were prepared by thermal decomposition of a chloride precursor mixture at 480 degrees C. Surface morphology and microstructure of the coatings, were investigated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and Grazing Incidence X-Ray Diffraction (GIXRD) analysis.The systematic study of the electrochemical properties and corrosion behavior of these coatings was performed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), Accelerated Life Time test (ALT) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The results showed that the uniform dissolution of the active surface layers was the main mechanism for deactivation of the electrodes, especially the anode with 30 wt.% RuO2. Also, adding RuO(2)up to 30 wt.% to the binary coating, because of the increase in active surface area and formation of the solid solution structure between ruthenium and iridium oxides, helped to improve performance and increase the working life of the anode.

These sets cover each one at least three of the four doping ranges: low doping (5 x 10(16)<[B] <1.5 x 10(19) cm(-3)), high doping (1.5 x 10(19)<[B] <3 x 10(20) cm(-3)), heavy doping (3 x 10(20)<[B]<2 x 10(21) cm(-3)), and phase separation ([B]>2 x 10(21) cm(-3)). The results are compared to those we have previously obtained on (100) homoepitaxial films in the same doping ranges. A detailed description of both the nature and the relative concentrations of the main surface chemical species on every set of films is reported. Besides the usual CHx bonds on the diamond surface, the following oxygen-related groups: Ether (C-O-C), hydroxyl (C-OH, only on polycrystalline films), carbonyl (>C=O) and carboxyl (HO-C=O) have been found on the surface of grown diamond films, upon spontaneous oxidation under air (no oxidation treatment has been applied).

The sequence of activity is dispersoid >812 alloy >matrix, with evidence seen for barrier oxide formation at all substrates and for high rates of oxygen evolution and some metal dissolution at the dispersoid phase. TEM results show an intact barrier oxide film formed at the 812 alloy at 10 V at 20 degrees C, but flawed films of less uniform thickness are seen when formed at 50 V. At higher temperatures, a porous oxide film forms at both the 812 alloy and the matrix phase. However, at the alloy, the underlying barrier film appears to be interrupted in some locations and the porous oxide is non-uniform and sometimes damaged. The capability for solution penetration, via flaws, into the oxide film at the 812 when formed at higher voltages or temperatures has been supported also by impedance measurements.

With the view to preparing such protective films, multilayered coating composed of montmorillonite (MMT) and triphenyl phosphate (tPP) along with polyethyleneimine (PEI), poly[(o-cresyl glycidyl ether)-co-formaldehyde] (CNER), tPP solution and MMT suspension was deposited via layer-by-layer technique so as to suppress the flammability of FPUF. A comparative study applying "cone test" revealed that multilayered coatings having PEI(CNER/NH2-MMT/PEI)(n) and PEI(CNER/NH2-MMT/tPP)(n) architectures, where "n" signifies the number of layer pairs, exhibited remarkable decrease in "peak heat release rate" (pHRR) of 20 and 25%, respectively, as compared to uncoated FPUF. Moreover, these coatings showed a 50% reduction in "fire growth rate index" (FIGRA) when compared to uncoated FPUF. This significant decrease in FIGRA after a specific combination of epoxy-clay features that such multilayered coatings can be used to protect the underlying FPUF due to the labyrinth effect offered by MMT and accelerated char formation by tPP. Furthermore, the evolution of volatile gases upon combustion of multilayered coated foam decreased due to the inhibition of oxygen permeation owing to the protective effect of the coating.

J	Parys, E; Jastrzebski, H								Light-enhanced dark respiration in leaves, isolated cells and protoplasts of various types of C-4 plants								JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				163	6			638	647		10.1016/j.jplph.2005.05.009				APR 2006	2006	The rate of respiratory CO2 evolution from the leaves of Zea mays, Panicum miliaceum, and Panicum maximum, representing NADP-ME, NAD-ME, and PEP-CK types of C-4 plants, respectively, was increased by approximately two to four times after a period of photosynthesis. This light-enhanced dark respiration (LEDR) was a function of net photosynthetic rate specific to plant species, and was depressed by 1% O-2. When malate, aspartate, oxaloacetate or glycine solution at 50 mM concentration was introduced into the leaves instead of water, the rate of LEDR was enhanced, far less in Z. mays (by 10-25%) than in P. miliaceum (by 25-35%) or P. maximum (by 40-75%). The enhancement of LEDR under glycine was relatively stable over a period of 1 h, whereas the remaining metabolites caused its decrease following a transient increase. The metabolites reduced the net photosynthesis rate in the two Panicum species, but not in Z. mays, where this process was stimulated by glycine. The bundle sheath cells from P miliaceum exhibited a higher rate of LEDR than those of Z. mays and P maximum. Glycine had no effect on the respiration rate of the cells, but malate increased in cells of Z. mays and P miliaceum by about 50% and 30%, respectively. With the exception of aspartate, which stimulated both the O-2 evolution and O-2 uptake in P maximum, the remaining metabolites reduced photosynthetic O-2 evolution from bundle sheath cells in Panicun species. The net O-2 exchange in illuminated cells of Z. mays did not respond to CO2 or metabolites. Leaf mesophyll protoplasts of Z. mays and P miliaceum, and bundle sheath protoplasts of Z. mays, which are unable to fix CO2 photosynthetically, also produced LEDR, but the mesophyll protoptasts, compared with bundle sheath protoptasts, required twice the time of ittumination to obtain the maximat rate. The results suggest that the substrates for LEDR in C-4 ptants are generated during a period of itiumination not only via the Calvin cycle reactions, but also by the conversion of endogenous compounds present in leaf cells. The stimulation of LEDR under glycine is discussed in relation to its direct or indirect effect on mitochondrial respiration. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

Typical syntheses of intermetallic nanoparticles include thermal annealing of the disordered counterpart in atmosphere (or vacuum) or colloidal syntheses, where the phase transformation is achieved in solution. Although both methods can produce intermetallic nanoparticles, there is difficulty in achieving monodisperse nano-particles, which is critical to exploiting their properties for various applications. Here, we show that overgrowth on random alloy AuCu nanoparticles mediated by size refocusing yields monodisperse intermetallic AuCu nanoparticles. Size refocusing has been used in syntheses of semiconductor and upconverting nanocrystals to achieve monodisperse samples, but now we demonstrate size refocusing as a mechanism to achieve the disorder-to-order phase transformation in multimetallic nanoparticles. The phase transformation was monitored by time evolution experiments, where analysis of reaction aliquots with transmission electron microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction revealed the generation and dissolution of small nanoparticles coupled with an increase in the average size of the nanoparticles and conversion to the ordered phase. This demonstration advances the understanding of intermetallic nanoparticle formation in colloidal syntheses, which can expedite the development of electrocatalysts and magnetic storage materials.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000486361900075	31430166

It is shown how the structure of the films evolves from an inorganic silica-like structure towards an organic SiOxCyHz framework when the relative proportion of TEOS in the plasma increases. On the one hand, the structure and properties of the silica-like films are shown to be very close to those of a thermal oxide. On the other hand, the organic films have larger refractive index and extinction coefficient but are less dense than the SiO2-like films. It is shown that the increase in the refractive index and extinction coefficient is correlated to the carbon incorporation into the film. It is further established that the O/Si content ratio is enhanced from about 2 to 2.5 with increasing TEOS volume fraction. This evolution is explained by the increasing number of Si-O-H and Si-O-CxHy. bonds in the material at the cost of the number of -Si-O-Si- bonds. It is furthermore shown that the abrupt character of the transition between silica-like and organic films is likely to be correlated to the depletion in oxygen atoms in the plasma.

Explosion dynamics								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				657	2			942	960		10.1086/511412				MAR 10 2007	2007	We present a detonating failed deflagration model of Type Ia supernovae. In this model, the thermonuclear explosion of a massive white dwarf follows an off-center deflagration. We conduct a survey of asymmetric ignition configurations initiated at various distances from the stellar center. In all cases studied, we find that only a small amount of stellar fuel is consumed during deflagration phase, no explosion is obtained, and the released energy is mostly wasted on expanding the progenitor. Products of the failed deflagration quickly reach the stellar surface, polluting and strongly disturbing it. These disturbances eventually evolve into small and isolated shock-dominated regions that are rich in fuel. We consider these regions as seeds capable of forming self-sustained detonations that, ultimately, result in the thermonuclear supernova explosion. Preliminary nucleosynthesis results indicate that the model supernova ejecta are typically composed of about 0.1-0.25 M. of silicon group elements and 0.9-1.2 M. of iron group elements and are essentially carbon-free. The ejecta have a composite morphology, are chemically stratified, and display a modest amount of intrinsic asymmetry. The innermost layers are slightly egg shaped with the axis ratio approximate to 1.2-1.3 and dominated by the products of silicon burning. This central region is surrounded by a shell of silicon group elements. The outermost layers of ejecta are highly inhomogeneous and contain products of incomplete oxygen burning with only small admixture of unburned stellar material. The explosion energies are approximate to(1.3-1.5) x 10(51) ergs.									55	1	0	0	0	0	55			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000244928500022

A structure searching method based on the previous understanding of the hydrogen bond (H-bond) network in neutral and protonated water clusters is found to be effective, covering a wide range of structural isomers of (H2O)(n)(+). With these local minima, we can analyze both the size and temperature dependence of the structure of (H2O)(n)(+) and solvation of the OH radical. Agreement between our calculated IR spectra and experimental data in the free OH stretching region confirms that the OH radical preferred to stay on the terminal site of the H-bond network at n = 5 and n = 6. Furthermore, we found that the OH radical began to form H-bonds with water molecules as a H-bond donor at n = 7 and 8. Vibrational signatures of fully solvated OH were found to be located at 3200-3400 cm(-1) coinciding with the additional peaks found in previous experimental data obtained by Mizuse and Fujii.									25	0	0	0	1	0	25			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000341295500030	25080970

However, producing a stable particle suspension for high efficiency and long-term stability remains a challenge. Here, the first report of the production of a nanofluidic BaTiO3 suspension containing a mixture of cubic and tetragonal phases that splits water under ultrasound is provided. The BaTiO3 particle size reduces from approximately 400 nm to approximately 150 nm during the application of ultrasound and the fine-scale nature of the particulates leads to the formation of a stable nanofluid consisting of BaTiO3 particles suspended as a nanofluid. Long-term testing demonstrates repeatable H-2 evolution over 4 days with a continuous 24 h period of stable catalysis. A maximum rate of H-2 evolution is found to be 270 mmol h(-1) g(-1) for a loading of 5 mg l(-1) of BaTiO3 in 10% MeOH/H2O. This work indicates the potential of harnessing vibrations for water splitting in functional materials and is the first demonstration of exploiting a ferroelectric nanofluid for stable water splitting, which leads to the highest efficiency of piezoelectrically driven water splitting reported to date.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2198-3844		WOS:000772873900024	35332701

Laminar hydrocarbon flame structure								COMBUSTION EXPLOSION AND SHOCK WAVES				45	4			365	382		10.1007/s10573-009-0047-z				JUL 2009	2009	From the very first experimental studies, based essentially on flame propagation velocity and flame emission measurements, successive improvements in analytical and numerical techniques have contributed to make the analysis of laminar flame structure a powerful tool for extending the knowledge on combustion chemistry, thermodynamics, and transport properties. This better knowledge is very beneficial to design efficient combustion devices with reduced pollutant emission. Overall net species production rates are derived from the experimental determination of the evolution of the gas stream velocity, temperature, and species concentrations in the direction normal to the flame front. For species involved in a limited number of reactions, rate constants can be calculated at the next step. The development, in the early 1980s, of numerical codes for simulating the structure of one-dimensional laminar premixed flames the flame structure data to be directly used for validating detailed reaction mechanisms. Species analyses are still performed with techniques based on local gas sampling by probes, despite flame perturbations, but flame structure analyses have been markedly enriched by the use of non-intrusive spectroscopic techniques. The former allow the analysis of a large variety of species, and they have proven to be very well adapted to the large number of intermediate species formed in rich flames or in flames fed by heavy fuel molecules. The molecular beam mass spectrometry technique has been recently improved by the use of new photoionization sources that allow identification of isomers and extend the knowledge on intermediate species involved in formation of benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and soot in flames. Amongst various spectroscopic techniques applied to flame structure analyses, laser-induced fluorescence has been largely used to perform accurate quantitative measurements of intermediate radicals that play a key role in the prompt-NO mechanism. In this study, the contribution of flame structure studies to a better knowledge of formation mechanisms of benzene and NO (x) is briefly reviewed.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0010-5082			WOS:000268870100002

Part II: anodic dissolution kinetics of a steel anode rich in silicon								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY				41	9	SI		1125	1133		10.1007/s10800-011-0332-x				SEP 2011	2011	The anolyte composition and process temperature could improve the kinetics of iron anode dissolution and subsequent ferrate(VI) production significantly. This also holds for the anode composition. Silicon-rich steel (SRS) was employed as the anode material to produce ferrate(VI), and the characteristics observed were compared with those of the pure iron anode obtained during our previous study. Using anolytes 14 M NaOH, 14 M KOH and mixtures thereof, the systems were studied by means of potentiodynamic methods, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and batch electrolysis experiments. In addition, scanning electron microscopy and metallographic images of the material surface were taken to identify changes in the phase composition of the material, caused by anodic polarization in strongly alkaline solutions. The dissolution kinetics increases with increasing temperature and, at 60 A degrees C, also with increasing K(+) content in the anolyte. Compared to iron, SRS easily dissolves into ferrate(VI), even at 20 A degrees C in pure NaOH, indicating the lower inferior protective properties of oxy-hydroxide surface layers. The current efficiency achieved was almost 55% under these conditions. In the other anolytes, a maximum current efficiency of ca. 40% was obtained at 60 A degrees C. The authors conclude that, at 60 A degrees C, the efficiency is lowered by intensified oxygen evolution. This causes intensive solution convection, disturbing the surface conditions supporting ferrate(VI) formation.									23	1	0	0	2	0	24			0021-891X			WOS:000294477400013		
J	Vangioni-Flam, E; Ramaty, R; Olive, KA; Casse, M					Olive, Keith/0000-0001-7201-5998			Testing the primary origin of Be and B in the early galaxy								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				337	3			714	720						SEP 20 1998	1998	Beryllium and boron measurements in metal poor stars have had a major impact on our understanding of the origin of the light elements in the universe. Two types of models have been proposed to explain the linear rise of the Be and B abundances as a function of iron observed in metal poor halo stars. In both cases, this Linearity indicates that fleshly synthesized C and O are accelerated by Type II supernovae and subsequently fragmented into Be and B. One mechanism advocates shock acceleration in the gaseous phase of superbubbles excavated by collective SNII explosions. Because of their short lifetimes, only the most massive stars (with an initial mass greater than 60 M-.) do not drift out of superbubbles, and participate in BeB production. The second mechanism is based on the acceleration of the debris of grains formed in the ejecta of all SNIIs (originating from stars with initial mass greater than 8 M-.) Here again, fresh C and O are sped up to cosmic ray energies by shocks.We propose a possible test to discriminate between the two scenarios. If supernovae of all masses are involved in BeB production, the Be/Fe ratio is constant, since both elements are produced in the same events. Alternatively, when only the most massive stars are involved in Be production, Be/Fe is enhanced at very early times because of the shorter lifetimes of these stars. This predicted difference in the behavior of Be/Fe could be tested by high quality observations at [Fe/H] less than or similar to - 3.We also note that the solution invoking only the most massive supernovae mimics a flat evolution of both Be/H and B/H as a function of Fe/H at low metallicity, and could thus resemble a "plateau" for these elements despite a lack of a primordial Big Bang nucleosynthesis origin. Consequently, there may be no need to invoke inhomogeneous Big Bang models to explain the initial production of BeB should a plateau be discovered.									61	0	0	0	0	0	61			0004-6361			WOS:000076124100010		
J	Butterman, Heidi C.; Castaldi, Marco J.								Biomass to Fuels: Impact of Reaction Medium and Heating Rate								ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE				27	7			539	555		10.1089/ees.2009.0372				JUL 2010	2010	We have recently reported on the impact of CO2 on biomass gasification and its ability to more effectively gasify biomass than steam. Continuing this investigation has led to understanding the impact of heating rates and different reaction environments. This article presents the results from the gasification of various biomass feedstocks. Heating rates were varied from 1 to 100 degrees C min(-1) to ballistic rates (similar to 500 degrees C min(-1)). Gasification media investigated include H2O/N-2, CO2, CO2/N-2/H2O, and O-2/N-2. Global activation energies for pyrolysis were found to be significantly higher than for gasification, whereas those for the grasses were significantly lower than the woods, possibly indicating a catalytic effect during pyrolysis of the high mineral content herbaceous feed-stocks. CO2 pyrolysis (110-450 degrees C) activation energy values for lignin, cellulose, and biomass were 22-49, 202-230, and 28-72 kJ mol(-1), respectively, and CO2 gasification (500-700 degrees C) values for lignin and biomass were 12-38 and 9-57 kJ mol(-1), although cellulose did not exhibit significant mass loss in the gasification interval 500-700 degrees C. Using a least squares fit on the rate of mass loss fraction, the global decomposition reaction during pyrolysis for lignin in either medium was found to be third order, whereas that for cellulose was first order and for the various biomass samples either first or second order. The most significant difference in biomass processing in CO2, when compared with steam gasification, occurred above 750 degrees C where nearly all of the biomass was converted to volatiles with less than 2% ash remaining after CO2 gasification. Only when pure CO2 was used as the gasification medium under a slow heating rate did complete processing of the components to volatile products occur. Gas chromatography analysis has shown the effect of CO2 on product distribution. Data are presented focusing on the relation between gasification medium, feedstock selection, and major chemical species evolution.

However, photocorrosion is the main drawback of CuO. Herein, CuO/graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with a unique microstructure, enhanced PEC performance, and considerable photostability is synthesized under microwave irradiation. A facile, one-pot method is utilized to directly deposit the nanocomposite onto fluorine-doped tin oxide from a solution containing copper precursor and urea. Possible mechanism of CuO/g-C3N4 formation through this novel method is investigated. It is elucidated that controlled amounts of urea critically determine the morphological evolution of CuO, while its excess quantities convert to g-C3N4 in the presence of CuO as the catalyst. Through an appropriate heat treatment, carbon is doped into CuO lattice. The obtained C-doped CuO/g-C3N4 demonstrates 227% enhancement over CuO in photocurrent density and similar to 80% photocurrent retention. The enhanced photoelectrocatalytic activity is mainly attributed to unique morphology of CuO, effective separation of charge carriers, and formation of heterojunction. These characteristics manifest the superiority of this approach over many other chemical-based methods. The nanocomposite synergistically integrates the advantages of both the constituents, offering a low-cost, efficient photocathode for PEC water splitting, photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, and degradation of pollutants.									24	1	0	0	2	0	25			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000562342900004

However, the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 is still restricted by the limited active sites and high combination rate of photo-generated carriers. To confront these drawbacks, a facile NH3 self-etching and TiO2 decorating method is employed in this work. The self-released NH3 with high concentration in thermal condensation process etches and exfoliates g-C3N4 into less aggregated nanosheets with abundant nano holes (similar to 2.7 nm). The specific surface area is up to 224 m(2).g(-1), which is higher than the previous reported samples prepared by template-free methods. The formed holes endow g-C3N4 nanosheets with more exposed active edges that greatly accelerate mass exchange and photo-generated carriers transfer. After decorating anatase TiO2 nanoflakes, the composite photocatalyst exhibits a Z-scheme heterojunction behavior and enhances spatial separation efficiency of photo-generated carriers greatly. As a result, the photocatalytic performance is significantly enhanced: the photodegradation rate on rodamine B reaches 99.2% within 8 min and the hydrogen evolution rate reaches as high as 1764 mu mol.g(-1) h(-1). This work provides a facile and low-cost processing method to prepare high active and stable photocatalysts, and show the importance in rational designing the nanomaterials by well-directed preparation process and energy band engineering.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000609011000006

Various rational APO-based heterostructures composed of APO nanoparticles (NPs) and band-matched semiconductor support are designed to address the above issues. Nevertheless, the size, density, stability, and dispersion of APO NPs are critical challenges for the photocatalytic performance of APO-based photocatalysts. Here, three-dimensional (3D) self-assembled TiO(2)hierarchical spheres (THS) prepared by a simple one-step hydrothermal method are employed as innovative support, and ultrafine high-density APO NPs with an average size of about 3 nm are successfully deposited and uniformly dispersed throughout THS to form hierarchical THS/APO composites. The novel THS/APO microstructure provides abundant reactive sites for photocatalytic reactions and promotes the photogenerated charge separation and transfer due to the ultrafine size of APO NPs and the TiO2/APO Type-II heterojunction. As a result, the THS/APO composites show significant improvement in photocatalytic activity and stability in methylene blue (MB) degradation. The reaction constant of THS/APO composites far exceeds that of either THS or APO, roughly 16 and 7 times higher than that of THS and APO under full-spectrum light, and 41 and 4 times higher under visible light. Our results strongly suggest new insights into the low-cost, large-scale application of high-efficiency APO-based photocatalyst.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000570416700001	32931469

The prepared samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) emission spectroscopy. The experimental study envisages the formation of 2-D nanostructures and observed that such kinds of nanostructures could provide more active sites for photocatalytic reduction of water and their inherent reactive-species mechanism. The results showed the excellent photocatalytic performance (432 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) for 1.5% BiVO4 nanoparticles in WO3/g-C3N4 composite when compared with pure WO3 and BiVO4. The optical properties and photocatalytic activity measurement confirmed that BiVO4 nanoparticles in WO3/g-C3N4 photocatalyst inhibited the recombination of photogenerated electron and holes and enhanced the reduction reactions for H-2 production. The enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of the composite nanostructures may be attributed to wide absorption region of visible light, large surface area, and efficient separation of electrons/holes pairs owing to synergistic effects between BiVO4 and WO3/g-C3N4. The prepared samples would be a precise optimal photocatalyst to increase their suppliers for worldwide applications especially in energy harvesting.									54	0	0	0	2	0	54			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000481883400010

Groundwater samples (n = 33) were analyzed for major cations and anions from which (n = 22) were analyzed for stable isotopic records (delta2H and delta18O). Solute chemistry revealed neutral to moderately basic nature (pH ranged 6.4-8.8) and showed a higher (ranged 552-3130 muS/cm) of electrical conductivity. Isotopic signals ranged from - 8.7 to - 3.30/00 for delta18O and - 60.1 to - 370/00 for delta2H. Bivariate plot of stable isotopes (delta18O and delta2H) showed that majority of the samples fell below the global meteoric water line (GMWL) and local meteoric water line (LMWL) of New Delhi, indicating enrichment of heavier isotopes in the aquifers, which explain that recharging water, has undergone evaporation before recharging the aquifer. Monsoonal precipitation was observed as the major source of aquifer recharge in the surveyed area. Vertical hydraulic connectivity of the aquifer layers was traced with the help of isotopic record which exhibited a more negative intercept for shallow depth tube well than the middle depth tube well. About 76% of the samples exhibited negative Schoeller index thereby indicated cation-anion exchange reactions while the remaining samples depicted the Base Exchange Reactions. Sodium-normalized Ca versus Na-normalized Mg and HCO3, indicated an equal contribution of silicate and carbonate type weathering on global-average weathering system. About 52% of the groundwater samples fell into the Ca-HCO3- water type while remaining samples fell into 33% and 15% of Na-HCO3 and Mg-HCO3 type, respectively. Water quality indices (viz. residual sodium carbonate, Kelly index, permeability index, magnesium hazard, and Chloroalkaline indices) revealed unsuitability of the groundwater for drinking and irrigation purpose at few locations.

However, their relative stability against loss of electrochemically-active surface area in relation to Pt catalysts is still debated. In this study, the evolutions of Pt3Co particle size distributions (PSDs) in fuel cell and aqueous environments were followed during accelerated stress tests (ASTs) using in-operando ASAXS. The measured evolutions showed a degradation mechanism dominated by loss of particles smaller than the critical particle diameter (<5.2 to 6.1 nm, CPD), which depended on environment and the AST. These evolutions were compared to that of a Pt catalyst with a similar initial PSD, which was found to have a lower degradation rate than Pt3Co. The ASAXS data, as well as data from aqueous dissolution, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, individual particle energy-dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, and kinetic Monte Carlo calculations support a loss mechanism of increased Pt dissolution from Pt3Co versus Pt due to destabilization caused by extensive dealloying of particles <similar to 5 nm during ASTs.

Herein, novel ternary all-solid-state photocatalyst Ag3PO4/g-C3N4/MoSe(2)composing of Ag3PO4 nanoparticles and MoSe(2 )nanosheets loaded with sheet-like g-C3N4 was first constructed by an in situ synthetic route. Furthermore, Ag3PO4/g-C3N4/MoSe2 photocatalyst showed greater visible-light-driven photodegradation activity toward CIP and TC than pristine Ag3PO4 and g-C3N4 due to the construction of Ag3PO4/g-C3N4/MoSe(2)Z-scheme photocatalystic system. Furthermore, a probable visible-light-driven photodegradation mechanism of all-solid-state Z-scheme system was discussed clearly, which was ascribed to the major active species of photoinduced holes (h(+)) and superoxide radicals (center dot O-2(-)) by free radical trapping and ESR experiments. Particularly, MoSe(2)as a noble-metal free mediator not only can promote the separation efficiency of photoinduced pairs, but also accumulate more light energy in degradation process. Additionally, this solid-state photocatalysis can offer a new perception for the design and application of novel Z-scheme structure modified with MoSe2 as an electron-transfer mediator.									43	2	0	0	4	0	44			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000562343800010

A modified glassy carbon (GC) electrode with two successive layers of conducting poly(aniline) (PANI) and lanthanum nickel oxide (LNO)-graphene oxide (GO) mixture was fabricated for urea electrooxidation in alkaline medium. Different conditions of catalyst preparation were examined for optimum electrocatalytic activity towards urea oxidation. GO improved the response and is considered advantageous support for the perovskite due to its structural and electronic differences compared to graphene (G). The highest electrocatalytic activity observed was for non-calcinated perovskite catalyst prepared by citric acid fuel and physically mixed with GO in the ratio (1:2). The use of La2NiO4 perovskite is beneficial with relatively low weight percentage of Ni (14.6 %) compared to other Ni-based catalysts for electrooxidation of urea. The perovskite catalyst is synthesized using microwave-assisted method that reduces chemicals usage and energy consumption. The non-calcinated perovskite catalyst and the (PANI/LNO-GO) composite were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive analysis (SEM-EDAX). The composite is applicable in temperature range (10 degrees C up to 50 degrees C), and at different urea concentrations from 0.1 M to 1.0 M in basic (KOH) electrolyte.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0379-6779			WOS:000553371200006

Especially, the precursors were tightly connected by hydrogen bonds, wherein glucose was served as a source of doped carbon. Spectroscopic and electrochemical analysis confirmed that the endmost nitrogen was replaced by the doped carbon to combine two melon parts, leading to the possible existence of the delocalized big pi bonds in the system. Moreover, the GCN-x not only maintained the excellent properties of the hollow sphere, such as high surface area, moderate porosity and short charges diffusion distance, but also overcame the drawbacks of low visible light response and high electron-holes recombination rate from bulk g-C3N4. Thereby, the visible light utilization rate and the photogenerated electron-holes separation efficiency of the catalyst were improved. The highest hydrogen yield of 305 mu mol h(-1) from GCN-0.2 was 28.5 times that of bulk g-C3N4. Finally, a possible mechanism underlying the photocatalytic performance of C-doped g-C3N4 hollow spheres was proposed tentatively. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

B	Marchand, D.J.								Understanding the physical and chemical properties of carbon-based granular fuels								Understanding the physical and chemical properties of carbon-based granular fuels								177 pp	177 pp						2015	2015	Coal and oil have been used as fuel sources for centuries, but the way they have been used has not fundamentally changed: coal is ground into pieces then burned, and oil is distilled into various liquid fractions that are then burned. This dissertation explores newer methods of utilizing those fuel sources. Coal gasification is the process where coal is heated in a low oxygen environment so that the solid carbon is converted into a mixture of gaseous products. But some aspects of gasification, such as the role of catalysts and the structural evolution of coal particles throughout the reaction, remain unclear. These aspects were studied by analyzing, ex situ, the physical and chemical changes of coal feedstock samples extracted from a fluidized bed gasifier at various times throughout gasification. The changes in feed particle composition and size distribution composition showed that the gasification reaction rate was slower than the gas diffusion rates inside the coal particle at a typical catalytic gasification temperature of 800oC. Detailed composition analysis of samples with and without added catalyst showed that the catalyst increased the overall reaction rate by promoting the dissociative oxidation of the coal by gas phase oxidants, which provided more active sites for carbon-carbon bond breakage. The conclusions drawn from studying the feedstock can be combined with the data from in situ analysis of the gasification reactor to provide a fuller picture of the gasification process. Petroleum coke, or petcoke, is a carbonaceous solid produced during oil distillation. Though petcoke could be an important energy source, its use is hindered by practical and environmental concerns. Producing a slurry with petcoke and water has been studied as an alternative method for utilizing petcoke, but the effective use of petcoke slurries requires that they have low viscosity while remaining stable against settling of the particles due to gravity. These rheological properties of petcoke-water slurries were examined and modified using various additives. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was found to dramatically reduce the viscosity of the slurry by adsorbing to the petcoke particle surfaces and modifying the particle-particle interactions. PVA was as effective at reducing the viscosity as naphthalene sulfonate-the most widely used additive for reducing the viscosity of coal-water slurry fuels-without adding to the slurry the inorganic sulfur which is present in naphthalene sulfonate. The slurries with low viscosity exhibited poor stability against settling due to gravity. The addition of xanthan gum imparted shear-thinning behavior on the slurries, which allowed much improved stability. The combination of PVA and xanthan gum provides an inexpensive, effective, and environmentally-friendly method of modifying the rheological properties of petcoke-water slurries.									0	0	0		0	0	0					978-13-219-3775-6	INSPEC:15829723

This study examines short-term (3 h) responses of three large kelps from the cold-temperate coast of Chile, normally adapted to water temperatures <16 degrees C, but exposed abruptly to simultaneous high temperatures and UV radiation during low tide in summer. The kelps were exposed in the laboratory to three temperatures (10, 20 and 28 degrees C) with and without UV radiation, and photochemical reactions, concentration of phlorotannins and antioxidant activity were examined. The exposure to elevated temperature (slightly exacerbated by the presence of UV radiation) decreased photochemical processes (measured as fluorescence kinetics) in the three studied species and increased lipid peroxidation in two of them. The concentration of total soluble phlorotannins was variable and correlated with the antioxidant activity in the presence of UV radiation. Insoluble phlorotannins did not change during the exposure. In all, the downregulation of the photochemical machinery, which was expressed as dynamic photoinhibition, and the rapid induction of soluble phlorotannins triggered by UV radiation minimized the effects of oxidative stress and maintained the operation of photochemical processes during short-term thermal stress.									71	2	0	0	65	1	72			0031-8655	1751-1097		WOS:000298740400009	22011039

However, because of the low conductivity of the transition metal oxide electrocatalyst, its application in this field is limited. In this study, we found that the doping of NiO nanosheets with a small amount (3-10 nm) of Pt nanoparticles (Pt/NiO-NSs) leads to considerable improvements in the Faradaic efficiency (FE) and NH3 yield compared with those obtained using pure NiO, breaking the common perception that commercial Pt-based electrocatalysts demonstrate little potential for NRR due to their high hydrogen evolution tendency. In a 0.1 mol/L Na2SO4 solution at -0.2 V vs. RHE, a typical Pt/NiO-2 sample exhibits an optimum electrochemical NH3 yield of 20.59 mu g h(-1) mg(-1)cat. and an FE of 15.56%, which are approximately 5 and 3 times greater, respectively, than those of pure NiO nanosheets at the same applied potential. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed that Pt in Pt/NiO-NSs exist as Pt-0, Pt2+, and Pt4+ and that high-valence Pt ions are more electropositive, thereby favoring chemisorption and the activation of N-2 molecules. Density function theory calculations showed that the d-band of Pt nanoparticles supported on NiO is significantly tuned compared to that of pure Pt, affording a more favorable electronic structure for NRR. The results of this study show that Pt can be an effective NRR electrochemical catalyst when loaded on an appropriate substrate. Most importantly, it provides a new synthetic avenue for the fabrication of highly active Pt-based NRR electrocatalysts. (C) 2022, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Herein, a chrysanthemum-like crystalline C@Cu2O/CuO composite with remarkable photochemical water reduction activity has been successfully fabricated via conditioned calcinations of the Cu(II) based MOF. Under visible light irradiation, Cu2O/CuO/C-350 gives a remarkable H-2 evolution rate of 26.7 mmol g(-1) h(-1 )with high external quantum efficiency of 52.4% at 425 nm. The unique morphology, significantly improved charge carrier separation and synergistic effects of the composite system should be responsible for the excellent photocatalytic activity. To get further evidence about the origin of the improved photoactivity of the Cu2O/CuO/C-350, a series of characterization has been carried out. These findings propose a new unexplored avenue for the fabrication of highly active and low cost photocatalyst for practical H-2 generation via photo-chemical water reduction.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000582367700029

Brown, N.C. Barnard, 3D computer simulation of the influence of microstructure on the cut edge corrosion behaviour of a zinc aluminium alloy galvanized steel, Corrosion Science 48 (2006) 2291-2303], first-order model used to simulate the localized degradation experienced in Zn-4.5 wt% Al steel coatings exposed to 5% NaCl aqueous solution. The temporal localization and intensity of discrete corrosion effects are predicted using established relationships and, in contrast to earlier models, the evolution of multiple concentration fields is included and calculated using straight-forward finite difference techniques. Changes in composition are included in the quantification of both anodic and cathodic processes involved in the corrosion of steel coatings in contact with aerated saline solutions. Reported [J. Elvins, J.A. Spittle, D.A. Worsley, Microstructural changes in zinc aluminium alloy galvanising as a function of processing parameters and their influence on corrosion, Corrosion Science 47 (2005) 2740-2759] and modelled performances of typical Galfan composition coated steels are evaluated for different coating microstructures undergoing so-called cut-edge corrosion. In summary, this latest model successfully matches measured rates of metal loss during localized corrosion. Additionally, the inclusion of multiple species diffusion functionality has greatly improved the simulation of the cathodic reaction in particular and the overall form of the current density distribution near the corroding surface.

In this work, layered double hydroxide (LDH)@ g-C3N4 composites with hierarchical flower-like micro/ nanosheets and a high surface area have been synthesized by a solvothermal method. HRTEM images exhibit that the surface of the g-C3N4 nanosheets is highly orientated with the main exposure of the (002) plane. Compared with pristine CoFe-LDH, the hierarchical nanocomposite presents an excellent and stable elecrocatalytic performance in 1.0 M KOH, with a small Tafel slope of 58 mV dec(-1) and an overpotential of about 275 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Simultaneously, CoFe-LDH@ g-C3N4 exhibits an exceptional performance for the HER in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, with an overpotential of 417 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 77 mV dec(-1). Therefore, this work not only accomplishes improved catalytic activity of CoFe-LDH by the introduction of g-C3N4 nanosheets, but also provides an insight into the correlation between hierarchical flower-like morphologies and photo/electrochemical catalytic activity for overall water splitting.									114	7	0	0	11	0	114				2052-1537		WOS:000460171400020		
J	Casuso, E; Beckman, JE								Beryllium and boron evolution in the Galaxy								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				475	1			155	162		10.1086/303503				JAN 20 1997	1997	We present a model for the evolution of the light-nuclide abundances in the Galaxy, aimed especially at interpreting the observed beryllium and boron abundances as a function of that of iron. We present two models, one for the Galactic halo and the other for the Galactic disk. The main characteristics of the halo model are (1) the relatively rapid change in the physical conditions, on a timescale of less than 2 Gyr, because of the exponentially increasing flow of gas from the halo to form the Galactic bulge-after this period, less than 30% of the initial gas remains in the halo, and star formation there is brought to a halt, (2) the low inferior mass limit for the initial mass function (m(l) = 0.01), implying that similar to 60% of the mass that condenses into massive bodies takes the form of substellar objects (masses less than or equal to 0.1 M.). With these assumptions, we can explain the abrupt increase in the observed metallicity distribution of halo stars near [Fe/H] = -1.7, the evolution of [O/Fe], He-4/H, [N/Fe], and C-12/C-13 versus [Fe/H], and that of [C/O] versus [O/H], and give an account of [Fe/H] as a function of time, during the halo phase. The main characteristics of the disk model are (1) a timescale of order 15 Gyr and (2) an exponentially increasing infall of gas with very low metallicity. With these assumptions, we can explain the prominent peak in the observed metallicity distribution of disk stars near [Fe/H] = -0.4, the evolution of [O/Fe], He-4/H, [N/Fe], and C-12/C-13 versus [Fe/H], and that of [C/O] versus [O/H] and also give a good fit to observed [Fe/H] as a function of time.The production of light elements (D, He-3, Li-6, Li-7, Be-9, B-10, and B-11) occurs principally via Galactic cosmic ray (GCR) reactions for all nuclides except deuterium and He-3. Differences between the halo and the disk are (1) a flatter GCR energy flux spectrum and (2) more GCR flux at early epochs (halo) than more recently (disk), as a result of better GCR confinement, both conditions first suggested by Prantzos, Casse, & Vstngioni-Flam.A significant contribution of the present paper is to explain the almost linear dependence of Be-9 on Fe (or on O) at very low metallicities: the observations show a more nearly linear than quadratic dependence, without requiring the very high local cosmic-ray fluxes implied by the explanation of Feltzing & Gustafsson of spallation close to supernovae. The explanation is that exponentially increasing outflow of gas from the star-forming zone implies the presence of more star-forming gas at very low metallicities ([Fe/H] similar to -3.0). The low inferior mass limit taken here in the initial mass function implies a reduction in the predicted relative number of high-mass stars formed. These conditions, together with the increasing yields of carbon for stars of intermediate and low mass at low metallicities, while the metallicity indicators O and Fe were being produced mainly in massive stars, cause the observed Be-9 abundance at very low metallicities, which is enhanced compared with the predictions of models in which Be-9, as a secondary element, depends quadratically on Fe. The exponentially increasing outflow also explains the sharp rise in the abundances of O and Fe and the observed peak in the stellar frequency distribution near [Fe/H] similar to -1.7. A feature of interest in the disk model, due to the exponentially rising infall of nonenriched gas, is the observed loop-back of the Be-9-Fe curve at near-solar metallicity; the Be-9 abundance is rising steadily while that of Fe has fallen back.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			0004-637X			WOS:A1997WD17900015

However, the redox history of the oceans during the following Cryogenian Period (similar to 720-635 Ma) remains poorly constrained. Here, we present a biogeochemical study based on Mo-isotope (this study) and Fe, C, Mo abundance data (previously reported data) for black shales of the similar to 660-Ma Datangpo Formation in the Minle section of the Nanhua Basin, South China. Iron speciation data indicate that the study samples were most likely deposited under euxinic conditions. The studied samples yield two clusters of delta Mo-98 data: +0.98 parts per thousand to +1.14 parts per thousand [+1.06 +/- 0.06 (SD) parts per thousand] and -0.13 parts per thousand to +0.68 parts per thousand ( + 0.65 +/- 0.31 parts per thousand), respectively, with the higher values found mostly in the lowermost black shales. The variably lower delta Mo-98 values probably do not reflect contemporaneous open-ocean seawater composition owing to lower aqueous H2S concentrations caused by substantial watermass restriction (as evidenced by Mo-TOC covariation patterns), whereas the high delta Mo-98 values may record contemporaneous Cryogenian seawater values. The seawater 898Mo values from our study at similar to 660 Ma are similar to previously reported seawater delta Mo-98 values at similar to 750 Ma (+1.11 parts per thousand) and similar to 640Ma (+1.15 parts per thousand), implying the existence of widespread oceanic anoxia throughout the Cryogenian. Because the subsequent Ediacaran Period shows evidence of greater oceanic oxygenation based on multiple geochemical proxies, our findings suggest that the process of oceanic oxygenation proceeded slowly during the Cryogenian Period. This may have been an important factor in delaying the first appearance of metazoans until the late Cryogenian and their diversification until the Ediacaran.\									39	6	0	0	7	0	43			0301-9268	1872-7433		WOS:000454376400012

It is a potential fuel for life in the subsurface of Mars and in the icy ocean worlds in the outer solar system. Serpentinization is also implicated in life's origin. Planetary exploration offers a way to investigate such theories by characterizing and ultimately searching for life in geochemical settings that no longer exist on Earth. At present, much of the current context of serpentinization on other worlds relies on inference from modelling and studies on Earth. While there is evidence from orbital spectral imaging and martian meteorites that serpentinization has occurred on Mars, the extent and duration of that activity has not been constrained. Similarly, ongoing serpentinization might explain hydrogen found in the ocean of Saturn's tiny moon Enceladus, but this raises questions about how long such activity has persisted. Titan's hydrocarbon-rich atmosphere may derive from ancient or present-day serpentinization at the bottom of its ocean. In Europa, volcanism or serpentinization may provide hydrogen as a redox couple to oxygen generated at the moon's surface. We assess the potential extent of serpentinization in the solar system's wet and rocky worlds, assuming that microfracturing from thermal expansion anisotropy sets an upper limit on the percolation depth of surface water into the rocky interiors. In this bulk geophysical model, planetary cooling from radiogenic decay implies the infiltration of water to greater depths through time, continuing to the present. The serpentinization of this newly exposed rock is assessed as a significant source of global hydrogen. Comparing the computed hydrogen and surface-generated oxygen delivered to Europa's ocean reveals redox fluxes similar to Earth's. Planned robotic exploration missions to other worlds can aid in understanding the planetary context of serpentinization, testing the predictions herein. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Serpentinite in the Earth System'.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			1364-503X	1471-2962		WOS:000505778500011	31902342	
J	Platek, SM; Keenan, JP; Mohamed, FB								Sex differences in the neural correlates of child facial resemblance: an event-related fMRI study								NEUROIMAGE				25	4			1336	1344		10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.12.037				MAY 1 2005	2005	Detection of genetic relatedness (i.e. kinship) impacts the social, parental, and sexual behavior of many species. In humans, self-referent phenotype matching based on facial resemblance may indicate kinship. For example, faces that resemble fours are perceived as more trustworthy, and attractive. Sex differences in behavioral reactions to facial resemblance among children have also been demonstrated and are consistent with evolutionary theory suggesting that resemblance might serve as a paternity cue. Using event-related fMRI, we show that specific regions of the brain are implicated in processing facial resemblance and a sex difference in cortical response to facial resemblance expressed in children. We found a consistent activation in the fusiform gyros across all face conditions, which is consistent with previous research on face processing. There were no sex differences in overall response to faces in the fusiform gyros, and also to faces that did not resemble subjects. When resemblance was not modeled, females showed greater activation to child faces than males. Consistent with parental investment theory and theories of sexual selection, males showed greater cortical activity than females in response to children's faces that resembled them. These data suggest natural selection may have crafted a sexually differentiated neuro-sensory module implicated in detection of facial resemblance that may serve as a kin detection and paternity cue. This process may capitalize on neural substrates involved in self-referent processing and familiarity detection. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

J	Liu, Yunxia; Sun, Beilei; Tajcmanova, Lucie; Liu, Chao; Wu, Jie								Effect of carbon residues structures on burnout characteristic by FTIR and Raman spectroscopy								SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART A-MOLECULAR AND BIOMOLECULAR SPECTROSCOPY				272						120947	10.1016/j.saa.2022.120947				MAY 5 2022	2022	Fly ash (-FA) from seven typical power plants in Shanxi province (North China) were collected to explore the effect of carbon residues (-CR) structures on their burnout characteristic. Burnout characteristic is expressed by the loss on ignition (LOI) content in fly ash. Raman spectroscopy and Fourier Transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy are used to characterize the structure of CR. The structure parameters include Raman parameter (the full width at half maxima (FWHM) ratio of D-1 and G, I-D1/I-G) and FTIR parameter (asymmetric stretching intensity ratio of CH2 and CH3 groups, A(CH2)/A(CH3)). Three samples come from circulating fluidized bed (CFB), and four samples are from pulverized coal boilers (PC). Then two types of power plants are numbered from one to three according to the increasing degree of feed coal (-C) metamorphism. The CFB-1-FA, CFB-2-FA, and CFB-3-FA have loss on ignition (LOI) of 9.01%, 16.4%, and 21.6% respectively, while the LOI contents are 1.99%, 4.62%, 23.7%, and 5.00% for the PC-1-FA, PC 2-FA, PC-3-FA, and PC-4-FA. The results show that carbon residues in the PC fly ash mainly have the shorter and branched aliphatic side chains with lower A(CH2)/A(CH3) value. While carbon residues in the CFB fly ash have relatively longer aliphatic chains, and intramolecular aromatization is the main reaction during combustion. The I-D1/I-G of the CFB carbon residues are generally higher than it for the PC samples, indicating a more ordered structure. Oxygen-deficient environment and the longer residence time at temperature around 900 & DEG;C in the CFB boiler promote the ordering progress of the CR. The ordered CR suppresses its burnout and leads to an increase LOI content in fly ash. In turn, sufficient oxygen and temperature around 1200 & DEG;C in the PC boiler make the CR further oxidize and decompose. The CR become less ordered and are prone to burn out, resulting in a reduction of the LOI content. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, the BaZrO3 composite mould was prepared by self-synthesized BaZrO3 powder as the surface layer (yttrium sol as a binder), Al2O3 as a back layer (silica sol as a binder). The influence of BaZrO3 particle size on the compactness of the mould, the morphology of penetration layer after directional solidification of the alloy, and the contaminant content in the alloy were investigated. The evolution of the microstructure of the surface layer and porosity, the interaction between the mould and the alloy, the morphology and composition of the interface, and the contaminant content of the alloy were investigated by an optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Archimedes' principle, Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) and Nitrogen and oxygen analyzer (IGI, LECO TC-436). The results show that the surface of the mould using fine-grained particles as the coating is denser and smoother after sintering at high temperature, the number of pores between particles is reduced and the size decreases, the porosity of the surface layer decreases from 17.3% to 13.5%. The surface layer thickness of the optimized mould is from 1000 mu m (2 layers) to 3000 mu m (4 layers). The thickness of the adhesive layer between the BaZrO3 surface layer and the Al2O3 back layer is increased from 300 to 1200 mu m, and the adhesion is also enhanced. The interface penetration layer between the optimized mould and alloy is reduced from 900 to 300 mu m, the penetration of the alloy melt is limited within the surface layer, and no exudate is observed in the back layer. The content of Ba, Zr, O in the alloy are reduced from 89, 16800, 7580 to 28, 4760, 3690 mu g/g.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1002-185X			WOS:000500083600019

Serra, Jose M/K-7646-2014	Serra, Jose M/0000-0002-1515-1106			Robust catalytically-activated LSM-BCZY-based composite steam electrodes for proton ceramic electrolysis cells								RSC ADVANCES				9	36			20677	20686		10.1039/c9ra04044g				JUL 4 2019	2019	Backbone electrodes based on an electronic conductor and a protonic conductor show advantages for proton ceramic electrolyzer cells (PCECs). This work, aims to shed further light on the nature of the rate determining steps in the anode operation and improve the reaction rate in high steam pressure electrolysis mode by (i) adjusting their catalytic activity through electrode infiltration with catalytic electronic-conducting nanoparticles; and (ii) electrochemical activation of surface species by applying a net current through the electrode. A composite formed by La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-delta (LSM) and BaCe0.2Zr0.7Y0.1O3-delta (BCZY27) was deposited on proton-conducting BCZY27 electrolytes and studied in symmetrical cells to investigate the anode microstructure and electrochemical performance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed in the 800-500 degrees C range under 3 bar of pressure of wet air (75% of steam). LSM/BCZY27 50/50 vol% showed the best performance with an electrode polarization resistance (R-p) of 6.04 omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C and high steam pressure (0.75 bar of air and 2.25 bar of steam) whereas LSM/BCZY27 60/40 vol% presented a R-p of 18.9 omega cm(2). The backbone electrodes were infiltrated using aqueous solutions of metal precursors to boost the electrocatalytic activity towards water splitting and oxygen evolution. The infiltrated cells were fired at 850 degrees C for 2 h to obtain the desired crystalline nanoparticles (Pr6O11, CeO2, ZrO2 and Pr6O11-CeO2) and electrochemically tested under high steam pressures and bias currents to investigate the influence of catalytic activation on surface exchange kinetics. Among the tested catalysts, the lowest electrode polarization resistances (<0.2 omega cm(2)) were reached for the Pr6O11, CeO2 and Pr6O11-CeO2 catalysts at 700 degrees C by applying current densities ranging from 1.57 to 14.15 mA cm(-2), and the Pr6O11-CeO2-activated LSM/BCZY27 electrode exhibited the best performance. Finally, the effect of pO(2) and pH(2)O was investigated aiming to characterize the rate limiting processes in the electrodes.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2046-2069			WOS:000474306500022	35515552

Here, we show that, upon thermal annealing in a reducing atmosphere, Au@Cu2O core shell nanoparticles transform into Au-Cu alloy nanoparticles with tunable compositional stoichiometries that are predetermined by the relative core and shell dimensions of their parental core shell nanoparticle precursors. The. Au-Cu alloy nanoparticles exhibit distinct dealloying behaviors that are dependent upon their Cu/Au stoichiometric ratios. For Au-Cu alloy nanoparticles with Cu atomic fractions above the parting limit, nanoporosity-evolving percolation dealloying occurs upon exposure of the alloy nanoparticles to appropriate chemical etchants, resulting in the formation of particulate spongy nanoframes with solid/void bicontinuous morphology composed of hierarchically interconnected nanoligaments. The nanoporosity evolution during percolation dealloying is synergistically guided by two intertwining structural rearrangement processes, ligament domain coarsening driven by thermodynamics and framework expansion driven by Kirkendall effects, both of which can be maneuvered by controlling the Cu leaching rates during the percolation dealloying. The dealloyed nanoframes possess large open surface areas accessible by the reactant molecules and high abundance of Catalytically active undercoordinated atoms on the ligament surfaces, two unique structural features highly desirable for high-performance electrocatalysis. Using the room temperature electro-oxidation of methanol as a model reaction, we further demonstrate that, through controlled percolation dealloying of Au Cu alloy nanoparticles, both the electrochemically active surface areas and the specific activity of the dealloyed metallic nanoframes can be systematically tuned to achieve the optimal electrocatalytic activities.									32	0	0	0	1	0	32			1944-8244			WOS:000383412000054	27557567

Here, we firstly report fully vertically aligned MoS2 (VMS)/ p-Si heterostructure photocathode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Furthermore, 3D iron-nickel sulfide nanoparticles of tailored atomic composition are formed simultaneously during the synthesis of VMS via one-step sulfurization to build 3D/2D transition metal sulfide (TMD) heterostructure thin film catalyst. The spectroscopic results reveal that the Fe-doped Ni3S2 nanoparticles on VMS/p-Si photocathode induce the electrochemically-benign band bending in the overall heterostructure, enabling a significant improvement in PEC performance and long-term stability. Scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy is used to vividly visualize the photocurrent enhancement by the various 3D/2D TMD heterostructures. This work provides promising strategies in developing high performance TMD-based electrocatalysts for practical applications in a wide variety of electrochemical energy conversion processes.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000655672000002		
B	Cung, K.D.								Spray and combustion characteristics of dimethyl ether under various ambient conditions: an experimental and modeling study								Spray and combustion characteristics of dimethyl ether under various ambient conditions: an experimental and modeling study								289 pp	289 pp						2015	2015	With a growing restriction on environment policy due to pollution and the global needs for replacement or alternative to conventional petroleum production, alternative fuels such as Dimethyl Ether (DME) provide the solutions in environment and economy for our future generations. As the simplest ether, DME has the physical and chemical properties that are potentially suitable for compressionignition engine in automotive industry. There are many remaining challenges in understanding the combustion of DME, fuel handling and storage, specific fuel-oriented engine design in order to use DME effectively on transportation sector. Nonetheless, the many favorable attributes such as high cetane number (good ignitability) and very low emission of DME have led to the increasing effort on research and development of this fuel. Low and high pressure injection system are continuously improved to handle the drawback from DME properties such as low viscosity (poor lubricity), high compressibility (higher required compression work). Meanwhile, fundamental research in the combustion and emission characteristics of DME fuel is necessary to provide insights on the fuel behavior at various conditions such as ambient temperature, ambient composition, fuel injection pressure, nozzle size, etc. One of the most advanced apparatus in combustion research is combustion vessel which provide desired conditions with high accuracy for spray and combustion experiment. The current study in this work investigates spray, combustion, and consumption and formation of species (i.e. formaldehyde) using an optically accessible constant volume combustion vessel. Experimental data, for example, liquid/vapor penetration, spray and flame structure, ignition delay, heat release rate, species evolution from laser application, are collected through several data acquisition systems and high-speed cameras. Various test conditions like of temperature, oxygen concentration, injection pressure are set to provide parametric study of DME. Also, the results were processed and used as validation of several models including chemical kinetic work, 1-D spray modeling, and CFD simulation to achieve detailed understanding and develop better prediction tool set of DME combustion phenomenon. A detailed chemical kinetic mechanism work was developed from other published mechanism to study soot and NO x formation in DME reactions, while reduced mechanism was also generated for a more time efficient in computational work while still maintaining the core species and reaction pathway of DME combustion and emission. Both experimental and numerical work show important conclusions and summaries in spatially and temporally ignition, species formation, heat release rate, spray characteristics, and others that provide very good understanding of DME fuel chemistry and physical behaviors. Confirmation of smokeless combustion in DME flame is also shown as the expectation of bluish flame from literature review. In summary, the goal of this dissertation is to enhance the understanding of DME combustion in a well-controlled environment, therefore providing feedbacks to the ultimate task in future development and application of a more reliable, effective, clean-fuel system.									0	0	0		0	0	0					978-13-390-8147-2	INSPEC:15853310

Such organisms were not isolated in a hen's eggs-producing farm not using avoparcin. Glycopeptide-resistant enterococci were also detected in broiler chicken carcasses that were delivered to a hospital's kitchen. The resistance was determined by the vanA gene as indicated by the detection of the inducible 39-kDa cytoplasmic membrane protein and of a vanA-specific DNA sequence amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Genomic DNA fragment patterns of strains from animal sources were different from each other and also from those of strains isolated in hospitals and from sewage treatment plants. This findings suggest the dissemination of the vanA determinant among different enterococcal strains of distinct ecological origin.									291	2	0	0	220	0	298			0378-1097			WOS:A1995QC24500007	7875564

The surface morphology, structural and spectroscopic properties of the as-deposited NCs were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected-area electron diffractometry (SAD), x-ray diffractometry (XRD), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy. The roles of different substrates for the formation of various textures of nanocrystalline IrO2 are studied. Several one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures have evolved by decreasing the degree of interface instability. The morphological evolution occurs from triangular/wedged nanorods via incomplete/scrolled nanotubes to square nanotubes and square nanorods (NRs), with increasing morphological stability. The results show that the three-dimensional (3D) grains composing traditional film belong to the most stable form as compared to all the 1D NCs, and the sequential shape evolution has been found to be highly correlated to a morphological phase diagram based on the growth kinetics. In addition, area selective growth of IrO2 NRs has been demonstrated on sapphire( 012) and sapphire( 100) substrates which consist of patterned SiO2 as the nongrowth surface. The initial growth of IrO2 nuclei is studied. Selectivity, rod orientation, and other morphological features of the nanorod forest can find their origins in the nucleation behaviour during initial growth. XPS analyses show the coexistence of higher oxidation states of iridium in the as-grown IrO2 NCs. The usefulness of the experimental Raman scattering together with the modified spatial correlation ( MSC) model analysis as a residual stress and structural characterization technique for 1D IrO2 NCs has been demonstrated. The field emission properties of the vertically aligned IrO2 NRs are studied and demonstrated as a high-performance and robust field emitter material owing to its low work function, low resistivity and excellent stability against oxygen.									50	1	0	0	4	0	51			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000238220900001

Regarding thin-film coatings, we scan various materials (SiO2, TiO2 and Al2O3) appropriate for the electrical passivation of Si surface defects, which result in high minority carrier lifetimes (up to 100 mu s). However, these passivating layers seem to act as a barrier for the photogenerated carriers obstructing them from participating in the hydrogen evolution reaction, thus limiting the onset potential (V-on). Regarding platinum (Pt) nanoparticles, two deposition approaches are followed based on using different co-reactants during the ALD process, i.e. an O-2 pulse or a N-2-plasma pulse, with the latter resulting in a higher V-on (505 mV). By combining thin-film SiO2 coatings of various thicknesses deposited on top of ALD Pt nanoparticles, a synergetic effect of performance and stability enhancement is observed, with V-on values reaching 525 mV. Finally, by systematically studying the Si photocathodes in a day/night cycle operation and using the case of electroless deposited Pt nanoparticles as a benchmark, the N-2-plasma deposited Pt nanoparticles coated by ultra-thin SiO2 film show an enhanced stability (85 h-4 days/night cycles).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000652675200001		
J	Wang Dan; Feng Bo; Zhang Xiaoxin; Liu Yanan; Pei Yana; Qiao Minghua; Zong Baoning								Nitrogen-doped Carbon Pyrolyzed from ZIF-8 for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction to Hydrogen Peroxide								ACTA CHIMICA SINICA				80	6			772	780		10.6023/A22010030				JUN 15 2022	2022	Electrochemical production of H2O2 from O-2 via the two-electron reduction reaction (2e-ORR) is a green and safe process that is being heavily investigated. Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF) as a subclass of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted enormous scientific interests due to their high porosity, excellent mechanical stability, tunable surface properties, and exceptional chemical and thermal stabilities. Herein, a series of pyrolyzed ZIF catalysts (p-ZIF) were synthesized by treating 2-methylimidazole zinc salt (ZIF-8) at high temperatures (900, 950 and 1000 degrees C). During pyrolysis, zinc was vaporized, leaving the metal-free nitrogen-doped porous graphitic carbon materials. The effects of the pyrolysis temperature on the structure and catalytic performance of the p-ZIF catalysts in 2e-ORR were systematically studied. In 2e-ORR in an acidic electrolyte, the p-ZIF catalysts displayed low overpotential, low Tafel slope, and negligible activity loss after 3000 cycles of accelerated durability testing (ADT). In particular, the p-ZIF-950 catalyst possessed the highest H2O2 partial current of 0.185 mA at 0 V vs. RHE, followed by the p-ZIF-900 (0.146 mA) and p-ZIF-1000 (0.135 mA) catalysts. The H2O2 selectivity over the p-ZIF-950 catalyst was also constantly higher than those over the other two p-ZIF catalysts across the potential range investigated and maximized at 89.2%. Highly efficient and durable H2O2 production was demonstrated on the p-ZIF-950 catalyst by the linear accumulation of H2O2 to 522 minol.g(cat)(-1) within 6 h, translating to an H2O2 production rate of 87 mmol.g(cat)(-1).h(-1). The morphology, composition, carbon defect, texture, and surface chemical state were characterized by techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), elemental analysis, Raman spectroscopy, N-2 physisorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The p-ZIF catalysts not only nicely carried over the regular rhombic dodecahedral morphology of ZIF-8, but also possessed abundant amount of nitrogen, high specific surface area, and hierarchical pore structure. According to the characterization results, the specific surface area and carbon defect are unlikely the key factors that determine the catalytic performance, while the evolutions of the average pore size and surface content of graphitic N mimicked those of the H2O2 partial current and selectivity on the p-ZIF catalysts. In light of the literature works, the large pore size is proposed to facilitate the in-diffusion of O-2 and out-diffusion of H2O2, while the graphitic N is able to enhance the activation of O-2 and desorption of H2O2, both of which are beneficial to the kinetics of the 2e-ORR reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7351			WOS:000821931900010

All of the samples displayed a morphology of irregularly rectangular nanosheets with a thickness of 7.0-17.4 nm. The photocatalytic performance of Bi2WxMo1_xO6 was much better than that of Bi2MoO6 or Bi2WO6 for the selective oxidation of toluene, with the Bi2W0.3Mo0.7O6 solid solution showing the highest benzaldehyde formation rate (1663 mu mol/(g h)), which was about 1.95 and 2.83 times higher than those obtained over Bi2MoO6 and Bi2WO6, respectively. Furthermore, 91% benzaldehyde selectivity and excellent stability were also achieved over Bi2W0.3Mo0.7O6. The enhancement in photocatalytic activity of Bi2W0.3Mo0.7O6 was attributable to the balance of fast charge kinetics and optimized energy band structure. The results of the reactive species trapping and active radicals detection experiments reveal that the photogenerated holes, superoxide species, and carbon-centered radicals might play the important roles in the generation of benzaldehyde, and the possible photocatalytic toluene oxidation mechanisms over Bi2W0.3Mo0.7O6 were accordingly proposed.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000812258000005

A novel direct Z-scheme CoWO4/CdS binary photocatalyst is synthesized by an in-situ hydrothermal method, and the enhanced activities of H-2 production and dye degradation are attained. The rate of H-2 production is 15.91 mmol/h/g, which is 24-fold higher than CdS. The CoWO4/CdS composites exhibited outstanding stability after five consecutive reactions. Meanwhile, the photocatalytic removal efficiencies of MG are about CdS < CWC-0.8 < CWC1.0 < CWC-1.4 < CWC-1.2. The preeminent photocatalytic property of CoWO4 /CdS composites is authenticated based on Z-scheme heterojunction. Most importantly, the enhancement mechanism is attributed to the effective isolation of photogenerated carriers and the existance of redox capabilities for CoWO4/CdS system. This work might provide novel conception for the design and construction of high-performance photocatalysts with direct Z-scheme. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We have synthesized a bifunctional Pt-IrO2/RTO (ruthenium-titanium mixed oxide) electrocatalyst for the HOR/OER (hydrogen oxidation reaction/oxygen evolution reaction) wherein IrO2/RTO acts as an OER electrocatalyst, upon which the HOR active Pt electrocatalyst is deposited. Pt-IrO2/RTO shows higher OER (eta(@10) mA cm(-2) = 0.26 +/- 0.01 V, i = 67 +/- 1.9 mA cm(-2) at eta = 0.32 V) and HOR (eta(@2.5) mA cm(-2) = 0.01 V, i = 2.78 +/- 0.11 mA cm(-2) at eta = 0.1 V) activity and higher stability in comparison to benchmark OER (RuO2, eta(@10) mA cm(-2) = 0.42 +/- 0.03 V, i = 3.1 +/- 0.2 mA cm(-2) at eta = 0.32 V and IrO2, eta(@10) mA cm(-2) = 0.33 +/- 0.02 V, i = 10.2 +/- 0.2 mA cm(-2) at eta = 0.32 V) and HOR (Pt/C, eta(@2.5) mA cm(-2) = 0.05 V, i = 2.58 +/- 0.08 mA cm(-2) at 0.1 V vs. RHE) electrocatalysts, respectively. Pt-IrO2/RTO exhibits higher bifunctional HOR/OER activity as compared to both IrO2/RTO and RTO, which is achieved through a combined effect of enhanced active site density and favorable electronic interactions (increased metal oxidation states of Ru and Ir) as confirmed by XPS and UPS. The deposition of IrO2 in Pt-IrO2/RTO is responsible for high stability by lowering the dissolution of the RTO support, as confirmed by ICP-MS. A FP-URFC tested with Pt-IrO2/RTO and Pt/C as the anode and cathode, respectively yields a mass-specific activity of 1050 +/- 22 A g(-1) at 1.8 V and 20 +/- 2 A g(-1) at 0.9 V under electrolyzer and fuel cell modes, respectively. The FP-URFC shows a round-trip efficiency of 40.2% at 1 A cm(-2) with low Pt-loading on both electrodes. Therefore, FP-URFCs using Pt-IrO2/RTO as the HOR/OER bifunctional electrocatalyst have significant potential towards efficient and cost-effective bidirectional energy and fuel production.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2398-4902			WOS:000645230300001

Specifically, the abundance of 2-methylhopanoids deposited during Mesozoic ocean anoxic events (OAEs) and other intervals has been interpreted to reflect proliferation of nitrogen-fixing marine cyanobacteria. However, there currently is no conclusive evidence for 2-methylhopanoid production by extant marine cyanobacteria. As an alternative explanation, here we report 2-methylhopanoid production by bacteria of the genus Nitrobacter, cosmopolitan nitrite oxidizers that inhabit nutrient-rich freshwater, brackish, and marine environments. The model organism Nitrobacter vulgaris produced only trace amounts of 2-methylhopanoids when grown in minimal medium or with added methionine, the presumed biosynthetic methyl donor. Supplementation of cultures with cobalamin (vitamin B-12) increased nitrite oxidation rates and stimulated a 33-fold increase of 2-methylhopanoid abundance, indicating that the biosynthetic reaction mechanism is cobalamin dependent. Because Nitrobacter spp. cannot synthesize cobalamin, we postulate that they acquire it from organisms inhabiting a shared ecological niche-for example, ammonia-oxidizing archaea. We propose that during nutrient-rich conditions, cobalamin-based mutualism intensifies upper water column nitrification, thus promoting 2-methylhopanoid deposition. In contrast, anoxia underlying oligotrophic surface ocean conditions in restricted basins would prompt shoaling of anaerobic ammonium oxidation, leading to low observed 2-methylhopanoid abundances. The first scenario is consistent with hypotheses of enhanced nutrient loading during OAEs, while the second is consistent with the sedimentary record of Pliocene-Pleistocene Mediterranean sapropel events. We thus hypothesize that nitrogen cycling in the Pliocene-Pleistocene Mediterranean resembled modern, highly stratified basins, whereas no modern analog exists for OAEs.									8	1	0	0	5	0	9			0027-8424	1091-6490		WOS:000604551600029	33318211

In the paper, four novel morphologies of MMNS including epiphyllum-like MMNS-NFs1, ice flower-like NFs2, grape-like NRs1, and nanorod NRs2 were successfully achieved via a facile two-step process by adjusting C2H5NS/CO(NH2)(2M) ratio and/or H2O/ethanol solvent composition. Electrochemical activities of as-prepared four samples were systematically studied, while 3D nanorods core-shell nanostructure MMNS-NRs2 exhibits high-efficient electrocatalytic performance towards HER (158 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2)) and OER (134 mV @ 40 mA cm(-2)). What's more, when MMNS-NRs2 was served as the cathode and anode for overall water splitting in 1.0 M KOH, only a low cell voltage of 1.52 V and 1.60 V were required for MMNS-NRs2//MMNS-NRs2 electrode pairing to reach the current density 20 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. MMNS-NRs2//MMNS-NRs2 also performs an outstanding long-term durability at least 16 h without obvious deactivation. The reason for outstanding electrochemical properties and stability of MMNS-NRs2 was owing to the fact that unique core-shell nanostructure can facilitate electron/ion transfer and mass transport, 3D nanosheets endow more active sites and higher electron transport rate and the synergistic effect of Mo and Mn composition. This work provides a well-designed structure and development for morphology engineering to construct high-performance material for clean energy conversion technologies.									12	2	0	0	0	0	12			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000498639000044

The purified enzyme was found, by mass spectrometry, to have a protein :11, of 40763 (value of 40761.6 predicted from DNA sequence) and a FAD prosthetic group M-r of 785.1 (theoretical value of 785.5). Glycine oxidase optimally catalyzes the conversion of glycine and oxygen into glyoxylate, hydrogen peroxide, and ammonia. Using samples of [2-RS-H-3(2),2-C-14]-, [2-R-H-3.2-C-14]- and [2-S-H-3,2-C-14]glycine, we found that in the overall process H-si is removed. Incubation of the enzyme with [2-RS-H-3(2),2-C-14]glycine under anaerobic conditions, when only the reducing half of the reaction can occur, led to the recovery of 98.5% of the original glycine, which had the same H-3:C-14 ratio as the starting substrate. The primary isotope effect was studied using [2-H-2(2)]glycine, and we found that the specificity constants, k(cat)/K-M, for the protio and deuterio substrates were 1.46 x 10(3) and 1.05 x 10(2) M-1 s(-1), respectively. Two alternative mechanisms for FAD-containing oxidases that involve either the intermediacy of a FADH(2)-imino acid complex or an amino acid covalently linked to FAD, formed via a carbanion, have been considered. The current knowledge of the mechanisms is reviewed, and we argue that a mechanism involving the FADH(2)-imino acid complex can be dissected to satisfactorily explain some of puzzling observations for which the carbanion mechanism was originally conceived. Furthermore, our results, together with observations in the literature, suggest that the interaction of glycine with the enzyme occurs within a tight ternary complex, which is protected from the protons of the medium.									6	1	0	0	5	0	8			0006-2960			WOS:000281052600015	20690620

Hydrogen energy has a high combustion conversion energy while water is its combustion product. In recent years, a way to convert water into hydrogen and oxygen has been found by human beings inspired by plant photosynthesis. However, water decomposition consumes a significant amount of energy and is expensive. People expect to obtain a water decomposition catalyst with low cost and high efficiency. This work selected a six-manganese containing polyoxometalate with a similar structure characteristic to photosynthesizing PSII to fabricate with graphite C3N4 nanosheets for the construction of composite film (Mn6SiW/g-C(3)N(4)NSs) electrode via layer by layer self-assembly technology, which was used for the photo-electrochemical decomposition of water under visible light conditions. The binary composite film electrode displayed good catalytic efficiency. The photoelectric density of the composite electrode is 46 mu A/cm(2) (at 1.23 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and 239 mu A/cm(2) (at 1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl). Compared with the g-C(3)N(4)NSs electrode alone, the photoelectric density of the composite electrode increased by 1 time. The reason is attributed to the fact that Mn6SiW has a similar structure characteristic to photosynthesizing PSII and high electron transferability. The construction of the composite film containing low-cost Mn6SiW to modify g-C(3)N(4)NSs can effectively improve the photocatalytic decomposition of water, thus this study provides valuable reference information for the development of low-cost and high-performance photo-electrocatalytic materials.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2073-4344		WOS:000676499800001

Milling the mixture for 110 h leads to the formation of SrCO3-alpha-Fe2O3 nanocomposites and the structural deformation of alpha-Fe2O3 via the incorporation of Sr2+ ions. Subsequent sintering of the pre-milled reactants' mixture has led to the partial formation of an SrFeO3 perovskite-related phase in the temperature range 400-600 degrees C. This was followed by the progressive development of an Sr3Fe2O7-delta phase that continued to increase with increasing sintering temperature until a single-phased nanocrystalline Sr3Fe2P7-delta phase was attained at 950 degrees C (12 h). This temperature is similar to 350 degrees C lower than the temperature at which the material is prepared conventionally using the ceramic method. The evolution of different structural phases during the reaction process is discussed. Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction data shows a value of 0.60 for the oxygen deficiency delta, in consistency with the Fe3+/Fe4+ ratio derived from the Fe-57 Mossbauer data recorded at both 300 K and 78 K. The Mossbauer data suggests that the Sr3Fe2O6.4 nanoparticles are superparamagnetic with blocking temperatures below 78 K. The surfaces of the Sr3Fe2O6.4 nanoparticles were shown to have a complex structure and composition relative to those of their cores with traces of SrCO3, SrO and SrFeO3-delta being detected.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying this regulation is not yet understood. We have investigated the Structural couplings of the extrinsic proteins PsbO, PsbP, and PsbQ of higher plants with the Mn cluster using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Light-induced FTIR difference spectra upon the S-1 -> S-2 transition were measured using spinach PSII membranes, and the effects of the selective depletion of extrinsic proteins were examined. Depletion of the PsbP and PsbQ proteins by NaCl washing revealed clear changes in the amide I bands with no appreciable changes in the bands of carboxylate and imidazole groups, whereas the depletion of all three proteins by CaCl2 washing did not cause further changes. The original amide I features were recovered by reconstitution of the NaCl-washed PSII with PsbP, and the same recovery was observed with C-13-labeled PsbP. These results indicate that the PsbP protein, but not PsbQ and PsbO, affects the protein conformation around the Mn cluster in the intrinsic proteins without changing the ligand structure. Reconstitution with Delta 15-PabP, in which the 15 N-terminal residues were truncated, did not restore the amide I bands, indicating that the interaction of the N-terminal region induces the conformational changes. This observation correlates well witha previous finding that Delta 15-PabP did not restore the Ca2+ and Cl- retention ability upon rebinding to PSII [Ifuku, K., et al. (2005) Photosynth. Res. 84, 251-255]. Therefore, the evidence strongly suggests that protein conformational changes around the Mn cluster induced by PsbP through its N-terminal region affect the binding properties of Ca2+ and Cl- and enhance their retention.									47	2	1	0	39	0	48			0006-2960			WOS:000268137600006	19492796

Introducing defects in a controllable manner can tailor properties of TMDs. For example, chalcogen atom defects in TMDs were reported to trigger phase transition, induce ferromagnetism, and drive superconductivity. However, reported strategies to induce chalcogen atom defects including postgrowth annealing, laser irradiation, or plasma usually require high temperature (such as 500 degrees C) or cause unwanted structural damage. Here, we demonstrate low-temperature (60 degrees C) partial surface oxidation in 2D PdSe2 with low disorder and good stability. The combination of scanning tunneling microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations provide evidence of atomic-scale partial oxidation with both atomic resolution and chemical sensitivity. We also experimentally demonstrate that this controllable oxygen incorporation effectively tailors the electronic, optoelectronic, and catalytic activity of PdSe2. This work provides a pathway toward fine-tuning the physical and chemical properties of 2D TMDs and their applications in nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, and electrocatalysis.									36	3	0	0	0	0	36			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000537682300052	32364379

ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				612	1			L53	L56		10.1086/424513				SEP 1 2004	2004	Nova explosions occur on the white dwarf (WD) component of a cataclysmic variable stellar system that is accreting matter lost by a companion. A Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) explosion is thought to result when a WD, in a similar binary configuration, grows in mass to the Chandrasekhar limit. Here, we present calculations of accretion of solar matter, at a variety of mass accretion rates, onto hot (2.3x10(5) K), luminous (30 L-circle dot), massive (1.25, 1.35 M-circle dot) carbon-oxygen WDs. In contrast to our nova simulations, where the WD has a low initial luminosity and a thermonuclear runaway (TNR) occurs and ejects material, these simulations do not eject material ( or only a small fraction of the accreted material), and the WD grows in mass. A hydrogen TNR does not occur because hydrogen fuses to helium in the surface layers, and we call this process surface hydrogen burning (SHB). As the helium layer grows in mass, it gradually fuses either to carbon and oxygen or to more massive nuclei, depending on the WD mass and mass accretion rate. If such a WD were to explode in a SN Ia event, therefore, it would show neither hydrogen nor helium in its spectrum as is observed. Moreover, the luminosities and effective temperatures of our simulations agree with the observations of some of the supersoft X-ray binary sources, and therefore, our results strengthen previous speculation that some of them (CAL 83 and CAL 87, for example) are probably progenitors of SN Ia explosions. Finally, we have achieved SHB for values of the mass accretion rate that almost span the observed values of the cataclysmic variables.									51	1	0	0	0	0	51			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000223634600014

Novel NiCo-LDH/P-CdS hybrid photocatalysts are fabricated by combining strategies of P-doping and in-situ loading of NiCo-LDH. P-doping creates a mid-gap at the bottom of the conduction band of CdS, which facilitates to prolong the life-time of the photo-induced electrons. Subsequently, the in-situ loading of NiCo-LDH is able to form heterojunctions between NiCo-LDH and P-CdS that not only promote the separation efficiency of carriers, but also effectively reduce the light corrosion phenomenon commonly observed in CdS. The as-prepared 2 mol% NiCo-LDH/40 wt% P-CdS sample shows a high visible-light catalytic H-2 production rate of 8.665 mmol.h(-1)g(-1), which is 45 times higher than pure CdS. The apparent quantum yield is determined to be 14.0% at 420 nm monochromatic light. Based on the calculation of density function theory (DFT), the rational photocatalytic mechanism has been proposed and is well consistent with the experimental results. Our study not only demonstrates a facile, eco-friendly and scalable strategy to synthesize highly efficient photocatalysts, but also provides a new viewpoint of the rational design and synthesis of advanced photocatalysts by harnessing the strong synergistic effects through simultaneously tuning and optimizing the electronic structure and surface.									146	11	0	0	15	0	147			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000472697500015

Using the internal electric field formed at a p-n heterojunction (HJ) is an efficient strategy to mitigate such limitation. Accordingly, the interfacial atomic structure and band alignment are the most crucial parameters for efficiency optimization. In this work, we report on the epitaxial growth and determination of the band energy alignment of NiO/Fe2O3 p-n heterojunction grown on Al2O3(0 0 0 1) substrate by pulsed laser deposition. We show that high crystalline quality NiO(111) thin films can be grown on Fe2O3 (0 0 0 1) with epitaxial relationships of [(1) over bar 1 1](NiO) vertical bar vertical bar[0 0 0 (1) over bar](Fe2O3)(out-of-Plane), [(1) over bar (1) over bar 0](NiO) vertical bar vertical bar[0 1 (1) over bar 0](Fe2O3) and [(1) over bar 1 <(<b>2)over bar>](NiO )vertical bar vertical bar[2 (1) over bar (1) over bar 0](Fe2O3) (inplane). The rotation of NiO hexagons by 30 degrees can effectively reduce the lattice mismatch from similar to 17.4% to similar to 1.58%. High resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that valence and conduction band offset of NiO/Fe2O3 heterojunction are 0.6 eV and 2.2 eV, respectively. Furthermore, our results also indicate that the energy level of Ni 3d is higher than the valence band maximum of Fe2O3. This kind of interfacial electronic structure not only facilitates the charge separation, but lowers the overpotentials for oxygen evolution reaction.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000447744200059

Herein, we show that the water oxidation activities of catalytic cobalt sites in a Prussian blue (PB) structure could be tuned systematically by decorating its coordination sphere with a combination of cyanide and bidentate pyridyl groups. K-0.1[Co(bpy)](2.9)[Fe(CN)(6)](2) ([Cobpy-Fe]), K-0.2[Co(phen)](2.8)[Fe(CN)(6)](2) ([Cophen-Fe]), {[Co(bpy)(2)](3) [Fe(CN)(6)](2) 1[Fe(CN)(6)](1/3) ([Cobpy2-Fe]), and {[Co(phen)(2)](3)[Fe(CN)(6)](2)}[Fe(CN)(6)](1/3) CI0.11 ([Cophen2 - Fe]) were prepared by introducing bidentate pyridyl groups (phen: 1,10-phenanthroline, bpy: 2,2'-bipyridine) to the common synthetic protocol of Co-Fe Prussian blue analogues. Characterization studies indicate that [Cobpy2-Fe] and [Cophen2-Fe] adopt a pentanu- clear molecular structure, while [Cobpy-Fe] and [Cophen-Fe] could be described as cyanide-based coordination polymers with lower-dimensionality and less crystalline nature compared to the regular Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue (PBA), K0.1Co2.9[Fe(CN)(6)](2)([Co-Fe]). Photocatalytic studies reveal that the activities of [Cobpy-Fe] and [Cophen-Fe] are significantly enhanced compared to those of [Co-Fe], while molecular [Cobpy2-Fe] and [Cophen2-Fe] are inactive toward water oxidation. [Cobpy-Fe] and [Cophen-Fe] exhibit upper-bound turnover frequencies (TOFs) of 1.3 and 0.7 s(-1), respectively, which are similar to 50 times higher than that of [Co-Fe] (1.8 X 10(-2) s(-1)). The complete inactivity of [Cobpy2-Fe] and [Cophen2-Fe] confirms the critical role of aqua coordination to the catalytic cobalt sites for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Computational studies show that bidentate pyridyl groups enhance the susceptibility of the rate-determining Co(IV)-oxo species to the nucleophilic water attack during the critical O-O bond formation. This study opens a new route toward increasing the intrinsic water oxidation activity of the catalytic sites in PB coordination polymers.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000793863700013	35200012

Thermal oxidation effect on structural and optical properties of heavily doped phosphorus polycrystalline silicon films								APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE & PROCESSING				104	2			739	748		10.1007/s00339-011-6332-1				AUG 2011	2011	The study reported in this paper contributes to better understanding the thermal oxidation effect on structural and optical properties of polycrystalline silicon heavily in situ P-LPCVD films. The deposits, doped at levels 3x10(19) and 1.6x10(20) cm(-3), have been elaborated from silane decomposition (400 mTorrs, 605A degrees C) on monosilicon substrate oriented aOE (c) 111 >. The thermal oxidation was performed at temperatures: 850A degrees C during 1 hour, 1000, 1050, and 1100A degrees C during 15 minutes. The XRD spectra analysis pointed out significant aOE (c) 111 > texture evolution, while in the case of aOE (c) 220 > and aOE (c) 311 > textures, the intensities are practically invariant (variations fall in the uncertainty intervals). The optical characterizations showed that refractive index and absorption coefficient are very sensitive to the oxidation treatment, mainly when the doping level is not very high. We think that atomic oxygen acts as defects passivating agent leading to carriers' concentration increasing. Besides, the optical behavior is modeled in visible and near infrared, by a seven-term polynomial function n (2)=f(lambda (2)), with alternate signs, instead of theoretically unlimited terms number from Drude's model. It has been shown that fitting parameters fall on Gaussian curves like they do in the theoretical model.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0947-8396	1432-0630		WOS:000292742300034

The morphology of alpha-MnO2, which is controlled by an oriented attachment (OA) process, is one of the key factors affecting its reactivity. However, the detailed crystal growth process and coupling between morphology and structure of alpha-MnO2 during OA processes remain poorly understood. We propose that the transformation of layer-based delta-MnO2 to tunnel-based alpha-MnO2 occurs via a multistage OA process. In the initial stage, the produced delta-MnO2 nanoflakes are found to spontaneously self-assemble into a nanoribbon with a large number of lattice defects via edge-to-edge OA. The presence of lattice defects promotes the generation of oxygen vacancies, and the Mn(iv) ions in the [MnO6] octahedral layers of delta-MnO2 are reduced to Mn(iii)/Mn(ii). The reduced ions subsequently migrate from the [MnO6] octahedral layers to the interlayers during this process. The hydroxide which acts in coordination with the interlayer Mn(iii)/Mn(ii) and oxygen atoms coordination with adjacent nanoribbons attach to each other driven by hydrogen bonding and form primary nanorods through a face-to-face OA mechanism along the c-axis. Concomitantly, the bonding of [Mn(iii)O-6] octahedra in the interlayer of the nanoribbons with adjacent [MnO6] octahedral layers leads to the fabrication of a new alpha-MnO2 tunnel structure from the original delta-MnO2. These findings provide insights into both the transformation mechanisms of the layer-based to the tunnel-based nanoparticles and methods for the efficient and controlled synthesis of nanomaterials.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2051-8153	2051-8161		WOS:000509344100015

The approach allows predicting the evolution of processes far from equilibrium, establishing criteria and driving forces for the developing of critical phenomena in the system. The thermodynamic description of highly nonequilibrium processes was performed on the basis of evaluation and analysis of the nature of the change in the second variation of entropy derivative delta S-2, which is presented as the derivative of the Lyapunov thermodynamic function. In order to solve the problem, the mechanism was justified and a kinetic diagram of the processes occurring during the liquid-phase oxidation of cysteine in the presence of complex compounds of cobalt (II) with o-disalicylidenephenylenediamine, cytosine, and molecular oxygen was used. Based on the expressions of the variation in chemical affinity of the reaction mixture, referred to temperature, and the variation in thermodynamic flow, an expression for the derivative of the thermodynamic Lyapunov function was derived. The thermodynamic analysis of the liquid-phase oxidation of the biosubstrate under study in the presence of mixed ligand cobalt (II) complexes by the indicated ligands in the vibrational mode based on the nature of the change in the derivative of the Lyapunov function allows to establish the reasons of oscillation processes in the considered homogeneous catalytic system. The loss of stability during redox processes in the system under study and their transition to a fluctuation mode occurs as a result of the strong remoteness of the processes under consideration from chemical equilibrium and, associated with this, the nonlinearity of the system, the presence of autocatalytic stages, as well as positive feedbacks was found.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0579-2991	2500-3070		WOS:000497988300009

The present work is an investigation of cobalt oxide based honeycomb structures as candidate reactors/heat exchangers in relevant compact and efficient THS systems. The formulations studied included extruded bodies from pure cobalt oxide and two different cobalt oxide/alumina composites (i.e. 95/5 wt% and 90/10 wt%) as well as cobalt oxide-coated cordierite honeycombs with two different loadings (i.e. 28% and 65%). The structures were evaluated with respect to their redox performance in the course of 5 successive cycles in the temperature window of 800-1000 degrees C and under air flow. Based on measured oxygen evolution profiles, honeycombs from pure cobalt oxide and cobalt oxide-coated cordierites exhibited very similar normalized (i.e. mu mol O-2/g Co3O4) redox performance. On the other hand, the addition of alumina had a moderately negative effect on normalized redox performance versus the two aforementioned formulations but contributed to the substantial increase of the honeycombs structural stability when compared to the extruded pure cobalt oxide monolith. The particular finding was based on performing, in a separate experimental setup, 10 redox cycles under idealized (i.e. no imposed loads) conditions. Pre-(i.e. fresh/calcined) and post-characterization (i.e. after 10 redox cycles) of extruded structures via mercury porosimetry revealed measurable decrease of bulk density and increase of mean pore size, indicating a net structure expansion/'swelling' effect.

J	Singh, Ravi; Raman, Venkat					Raman, Venkatramanan/0000-0002-2750-0246			Two-dimensional direct numerical simulation of nanoparticle precursor evolution in turbulent flames using detailed chemistry								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				207		SI		794	802		10.1016/j.cej.2012.07.064				OCT 1 2012	2012	Flame-based synthesis is an attractive industrial process for the large-scale generation of nanoparticles. In this aerosol process, a gasified precursor is injected into a high-temperature turbulent flame, where oxidation followed by particle nucleation and other solid phase dynamics create nanoparticles. Precursor oxidation, which ultimately leads to nucleation, is strongly influenced by the turbulent flame dynamics. Here, direct numerical simulation of a canonical homogeneous flow is used to understand the interaction between a methane/air flame and titanium tetrachloride oxidation to titania. Detailed chemical kinetics is used to describe the combustion and precursor oxidation processes. Results show that the initial precursor decomposition is heavily influenced by the gas phase temperature field. However, temperature insensitivity of subsequent reactions in the precursor oxidation pathway slow down conversion to the titania. Consequently, titania formation occurs at much longer time scales compared to that of hydrocarbon oxidation. Further, only a fraction of the precursor is converted to titania, and a significant amount of partially-oxidized precursor species are formed. Introducing the precursor in the oxidizer stream as opposed to the fuel stream has only a minimal impact on the oxidation dynamics. In order to understand modeling issues, the DNS results are compared with the laminar flamelet model. It is shown that the flamelet assumption qualitatively reproduces the oxidation structure. Further, reduced oxygen concentration in the near-flame location critically affects titania formation.

The commonly applied radical quenching experiments cannot provide direct evidences on generation and evolution of radicals in AOPs, while electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) is a cutting-edge technology to identify radicals based on spectral characteristics. However, the complexity of EPR spectrum brings uncertainty and inconsistency to radical identification and mechanism clarification. This work presented a comprehensive study on identification of radicals by in-situ EPR analysis in four typical UV-based homogenous AOPs, including UV/H2O2, UV/peroxodisulfate (and peroxymonosulfate), UV/peracetic acid and UV/IO4- systems. Radical formation mechanism was also clarified based on EPR results. A reliable EPR method using organic solvents was proposed to identify alkoxy and alkyl radicals (CH3C(=O)OO center dot, CH3C(=O)O center dot and center dot CH3) in UV/PAA system. Two activation pathways for radical production were proposed in UV/IO4- system, in which the produced IO3 center dot, IO4 center dot, center dot OH and hydrated electron were precisely detected. It is interesting that addition of specific organic solvents can effectively identify oxygen-center and carbon-center radicals. A key parameter in EPR spectrum for 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) spin adduct, AH, is ranked as: center dot CH3 (23 G) >center dot OH (15 G) >IO3 center dot (12.9 G) >O-2 center dot (11 G) >=center dot OOH (9-11 G) >= IO4 center dot (9-10 G) >= SO4 center dot- (9-10 G) >CH3C(=O)OO center dot (8.5 G) > CH3C(=O)O center dot (7.5 G). This study will give a systematic method on identification of radicals in AOPs, and shed light on the insightful understanding of radical production mechanism.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0043-1354	1879-2448		WOS:000835552300003	35728498

In the numerical simulations, a two-dimensional domain with periodicity at the transverse far field boundaries is resolved using a high accuracy finite difference method and employing a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism and detailed transport properties. In the experiments a specially designed adiabatic flat-flame burner, a so-called heat flux burner, is employed. A key parameter, the standoff distance between the flame front and the burner exit plate, is identified. A critical standoff distance is found, above which cellular flame instability is observed. It is shown that the critical standoff distance is closely related to the density ratio and the laminar flame thickness for each flame studied. The observed onset of cellular flames is governed by the hydrodynamic instability mechanism, which is generally suppressed by the burner when the flame is very close to the burner plate. Diffusive-thermal effects play an important role in the flame instability when the flame is far from the burner. The critical standoff distance has no clear correlation with the Lewis number, indicating a less significant effect of diffusive-thermal instability on the flames near the burner.

After heating at 1400 degrees C, an outer layer of mixed TiO2 and Al2TiO5 phases and a cracked alpha-Al2O3 inner layer were formed. After heating to 1200 C and cooling to room temperature, two types of planar defect were identified in surface TiO2 grains: twins with (2 0 0) twin planes, and stacking faults bounded by partial dislocations. Formation of planar defects released the thermal stresses that had generated in TiO2 grains due to thermal expansion mismatch of the phases (TiO2, alpha-Al2O3 and Al2TiO5) in the oxide scale. After heating to 1400 degrees C and cooling to room temperature, crack propagation in TiO2 grains resulted from the thermal expansion mismatch of the phases in the oxide scale, the high anisotropy of thermal expansion in Al2TiO5 and the volume changes associated with the reactions during Ti2AlC oxidation. An atomistic oxidation mechanism is proposed, in which the growth of oxide scale is caused by inward diffusion of O2- and outward diffusion of Al3+ and Ti4+. The weakly bound Al leaves the Al atom plane in the layered structure of Ti2AlC, and diffuses outward to form a protective inner alpha-Al2O3 layer between 1100 and 1300 degrees C. However, the alpha-Al2O3 layer becomes cracked at 1400 degrees C, providing channels for rapid ingress of oxygen to the body, leading to severe oxidation. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc.

However, the grid is liable to be severely attacked, depending on the composition of the alloy. In this study, Pb-0.08 mass%Ca-Sn alloys with a wide range of Sn contents were prepared and the corrosion tests with charge/immersion cycling were carried out in 4.50 kmol m(-3) H2SO4 at 348 K for 604.8 ks. The total mass change during the corrosion test, which is the sum of mass change of the sample electrode and amount of suspended powder in the solution, increases with decreasing of the Sn content. For the Pb-Ca-Sn alloys with 0 similar to0.20 mass%Sn, the amounts of the total mass change during the corrosion test with charge/immersion are about 8 times as much as those with immersion. A proportional correlation between the total mass change and Ca dissolution can be recognized during the corrosion test, with charge/immersion or with immersion. And, high Sn contents tend to coarsen the grain structures of the Pb-Ca-Sn alloy. These data suggest that the corrosion attack has mainly occurred at the grain boundary of the alloy. Moreover, the analysis of the charge reaction makes clear that about 97 similar to 99% of the charge current is used for the oxygen evolution. Only 0.08 similar to2.75% of the current is spent in formation of the corrosion layer consisting of PbSO4 and beta -PbO2 and the ratio decreases as the Sn content increases.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0021-4876	1880-6880		WOS:000171090000010

Two main effects occur when polyolefins, such as iPP, are subjected to ionizing radiation: crosslinking and scission of macromolecules. The domination of one or the other of these competitive processes is determined by both the structural peculiarities of the polymers and the experimental irradiation conditions. Gel and infrared (IR) spectroscopy measurements were used to determine the changes in the degree of network formation and oxidative degradation, respectively. Sol gel analysis was studied in detail using the Charlesby-Pinner (C-P) equation. The radiation-induced changes in the structure and evolution of oxygen-containing species were also studied through dielectric loss (tan delta) analysis in a wide temperature and/or frequency range. Evolution of low temperature dielectric relaxations with gamma irradiation was investigated. The results showed that degradation was the major reaction in the initial step of irradiation, no matter what the atmosphere was. The C-P equation seemed applicable when stabilized iPP was irradiated within a certain dose range in various atmospheres. The iPP irradiated in acetylene/air had the lowest/highest values for oxidation level, dielectric losses, D(g) and G(s)/G(x) values. The calculated D(g) values are 1.5 and 5 times larger for the irradiation in DD water and air than for the acetylene. Furthermore, our data confirm that oxidation strongly affects the gel point but has a much lower effect on the G(s)/G(x) ratio. In the case of dielectric relaxation measurements, the connection between the oxidative degradation and dielectric properties is well established and is in good agreement with IR spectroscopy measurements. The amount of carbonyl, hydroperoxide and other polar groups is much higher for the irradiation in air than in other media, leading to higher dielectric losses. Disappearance of low temperature (delta and gamma) relaxations with gamma radiation confirmed great sensitivity of iPP structure to radiation-induced changes. Complete "vanishing" of the gamma relaxation in iPP samples irradiated in air is connected with a large radiation-induced oxidative degradation in this medium. Similar crosslinking, oxidation and dielectric behaviour was observed for the samples irradiated in water and acetylene, indicating DD water as a good crosslinking medium.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0367-598X			WOS:000280041500007

A correlation between FNR content and tolerance to oxidative stress is well established, although the precise mechanism remains unclear. We investigated the impact of altered FNR content and localization on electron transport and superoxide radical evolution in isolated thylakoids, and probed resulting changes in redox homeostasis, expression of oxidative stress markers, and tolerance to high light in planta. Our data indicate that the ratio of Fd(red) to FNR is critical, with either too much or too little FNR potentially leading to increased superoxide production, and perception of oxidative stress at the level of gene transcription. In FNR overexpressing plants, which show more NADP(H) and glutathione pools, improved tolerance to high-light stress indicates that disturbance of chloroplast redox poise and increased free radical generation may help "prime" the plant and induce protective mechanisms. In fnr1 knock-outs, the NADP(H) and glutathione pools are more oxidized relative to the wild type, and the photoprotective effect is absent despite perception of oxidative stress at the level of gene transcription.									28	1	0	0	26	0	29			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000391172300011	27634426

We test this theory by characterizing the effects of exogenous oxidative insult and its interaction with thermal stress and diet quality on a suite of life-history traits and correlations in Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes. We also quantify demographic aging rates and endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in live animals.Results: Our findings indicate a tradeoff between investment in reproduction and antioxidant defense (somatic maintenance) consistent with theoretical predictions, but correlations between standard life-history traits yield little evidence that oxidative stress generates strict tradeoffs. Increasing oxidative insult, however, shows a strong tendency to uncouple positive phenotypic correlations and, in particular, to reduce the correlation between reproduction and lifespan. We also found that mild oxidative insult results in lower levels of endogenous ROS accompanied by hormetic changes in lifespan, demographic aging, and reproduction that disappear in combined-stress treatments-consistent with the oxidative stress theory of aging.Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that oxidative stress is a direct contributor to life-history trait variation and that traditional tradeoffs are not necessary to invoke oxidative stress as a mediator of relationships between life-history traits, supporting previous calls for revisions to theory.									19	0	0	0	17	0	19			1471-2148			WOS:000340958900001	25056725

Here, we account a unique multifunctional flake-like CoS deposited over the flexible carbon cloth (CoS@CC) by a facile hydrothermal technique. The single-phase hexagonal structured CoS@CC with high crystallinity was identified through the XRD analysis. The morphological feature portrays the uniform distribution of flake-like CoS over carbon cloth. The electrocatalytic properties of the prepared flake-like CoS (CoS@CC) suggests improved electroactivity of requiring minimal overpotentials of 280 mV (OER) and 264 mV (HER) to accomplish a pre-eminent current density of 20 mA cm(-2). In addition, a lab-scale water splitting system was projected to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a low cell voltage of 1.65 V. In view to driving the fabricated water splitting system, a flexible (CoS@CC parallel to rGO) supercapattery was fabricated to deliver an improved specific energy of 38 Wh kg(-1) at a superior specific power of 533 W kg(-1). Therefore, the prepared CoS@CC electrode with improved flexibility, useful catalytic activity, expressive kinetics, and resilient strength serves as a multifunctional material for prospective energy conversion and storage systems.									29	0	0	0	0	0	29			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000487838900103		
J	Yeon, Jei-Won; Pyun, Su-Il								Roles of adsorbed OH and adsorbed H in the oxidation of hydrogen and the reduction of UO22+ ions at Pt electrodes under non-conventional conditions								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY				37	8			905	912		10.1007/s10800-007-9329-x				AUG 2007	2007	The roles of adsorbed hydroxyl radicals, OH, at a high temperature and adsorbed hydrogen atoms, H, in an acidic solution were investigated in the electrochemical reactions on Pt electrode by using potentiodynamic polarisation experiment, cyclic voltammetry and constant-potential electrolysis combined with UV/VIS analysis. From the analysis of the polarisation curves obtained from Pt electrode in a 0.185 M H3BO3 solution at 473 K, it was found that the reducing capability of dissolved hydrogen is significantly enhanced due to the increases of the mass transfer and the electron transfer rates. Especially, it is suggested that the stable Pt-OHad plays a significant role in the passivation reaction in the potential range from 0.60 to 0.75 V-SHE. From the analyses of the experimental results for the electrochemical reduction of UO22+ ions on Pt surface in a 1.0 M HClO4 solution, it is recognised that the reduction reaction of UO22+, to U4+ 2 ions is strongly dependent on the hydrogen atoms adsorbed on Pt electrode (indirect reduction of UO22+ ) as well as on the electrons transferred from Pt of UO22+). In addition, the of UO22+ reduction mechanism UO22+ ions involved in Pt-H-ad is also proposed.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0021-891X			WOS:000248120100005

Current multidimensional simulations of SNIa predict a significant amount of, so far unobserved, carbon and oxygen moving at low velocities. It has been proposed that these drawbacks can be resolved if there is a sudden jump to a detonation (delayed detonation), but these kinds of models have been explored mainly in one dimension. Here we present new three-dimensional delayed detonation models in which the deflagraton-to-detonation transition (DDT) takes place in conditions like those favored by one-dimensional models.Methods. We have used a smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics code adapted to follow all the dynamical phases of the explosion, with algorithms devised to handle subsonic as well as supersonic combustion fronts. The starting point was a centrally ignited C-O white dwarf of 1.38 M-circle dot. When the average density on the flame surface reached similar to 2-3 x 10(7) g cm(-3) a detonation was launched.Results. The detonation wave processed more than 0.3 M-circle dot of carbon and oxygen, emptying the central regions of the ejecta of unburned fuel and raising its kinetic energy close to the fiducial 10(51) erg expected from a healthy type Ia supernova. The final amount of Ni-56 synthesized also was in the correct range. However, the mass of carbon and oxygen ejected is still too high.Conclusions. The three-dimensional delayed detonation models explored here show an improvement over pure deflagration models, but they still fail to coincide with basic observational constraints. However, there are many aspects of the model that are still poorly known (geometry of flame ignition, mechanism of DDT, properties of detonation waves traversing a mixture of fuel and ashes). Therefore, it will be worth pursuing its exploration to see if a good SNIa model based on the three-dimensional delayed detonation scenario can be obtained.									26	1	0	0	0	0	26			1432-0746			WOS:000252713200017

Corrosion evaluation using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in copper electrowinning electrolyte revealed that PC deposited coating has higher corrosion resistance than its DC counterpart, due to its higher incorporated particles and increased surface homogeneity. However, it was demonstrated that the presence of CoSO4 as an additive in the electrolyte is crucial for the coating (irrespective of the deposition method) to maintain its higher electrochemical stability. Moreover, after prolonged polarization, the coating exhibited higher impedance in the subsequent EIS results as compared to that of the substrate.									32	3	0	0	1	0	33			0010-938X	1879-0496		WOS:000480374200043		
J	Robinson, AJ; Searle, JR; Worsley, DA					Searle, Justin/0000-0003-1101-075X			Novel flat panel reactor for monitoring photodegradation								MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				20	8			1041	1048		10.1179/026708304225019885				AUG 2004	2004	A closed system incorporating FTIR continuous monitoring of the gas phase and a novel gas cell for the UV irradiation of flat panels of organic coatings is described. This has been used to probe various aspects of the photocatalysed degradation of TiO2 pigmented polymer films under UVA illumination. The flat panel cell is machined from a single block of aluminium and is specifically designed to minimise dead volumes, enable rapid gas mixing and be suitable for the investigation of flat coupons of material up to 220 x 100 mm in size. The cell incorporates a gas input and output channel in its base feeding and fed by small bore holes drilled in such a way as to maximise the exhaustive effects on the contents of the cell. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the design the effect of TiO2 pigment photoactivity on the rates of degradation of a commercial acrylic emulsion paint using commercial photostable TiO2 grades is reported. In testing using this new reactor configuration it has been possible to correlate photoactivities obtained over periods of several thousand hours Xenon Arc exposure, which is the most reliable test currently available. The test cell has also been used to evaluate other coating components. Using unplasticised PVC films we have found that the rate of photogenerated CO2 falls by up to 40% when a simple molecular UV absorber (2 hydroxybenzophenone) is added at levels of up to levels of 1.5% per hundred resin (PHR). Beyond this there is little further reduction in photoactivity. Finally the test cell has been used to investigate the effects of TiO2 loading on the rates Of CO2 evolution from irradiated unplasticised PVC films pigmented with 0 - 70 PHR TiO2. The initial rate of photodegradation (over 100 min) follows a linear trend to increased CO2 evolution rates up to 50 PHR TiO2. There is a transition to a secondary rate after the production of 1-8 mmol m(-2) Of CO2 suggesting that after a set amount of degradation there is a change in the reaction rate. This rate is still proportional to the concentration of TiO2. It is likely that this is due to a combination of acid catalysis and the generation of porosity in the irradiated surface, the latter enabling greater oxygen access to the irradiated TiO2.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			0267-0836	1743-2847		WOS:000223912800020

The techniques like cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are utilized to achieve the catalytic activity performance. Surface characteristics are achieved by means of scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) techniques. Enhancing the loading magnitude of CNT into catalyst's ingredient can meaningfully develop the catalytic activity of the electrocatalyst towards propylene oxidation. The impact of altering the concentration of propylene glycol and the scanning rate on the resulting electrocatalyst performance during the oxidation cycle is considered. Chronoamperograms present an amplify of the steady state oxidation current density values after addition of these nano-catalysts. A promising catalytic stability of nano-catalyst has been achieved in electing its use for propylene glycol electro-oxidation in fuel cells applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2045-2322			WOS:000804787700010	35650287

However, its mechanism is still unclear. In this paper, the early-age hydration kinetics and the evolution of the solid phases, aqueous species and microstructures in a cement-steel slag composite binder are investigated to explore how steel slag inhibits the early-age hydration of cement. Two novel phenomena are found: (1) steel slag slows the depletion of gypsum and reduces the formation of ettringite, and (2) steel slag significantly inhibits the precipitation of CH and C-S-H. The results show that the addition of steel slag increases the Ca concentration in the pore solution, reduces the supersaturation of the pore solution with respect to CH and inhibits the nucleation and growth of C-S-H. Based on the above results, the retardation mechanisms of steel slag on the initial setting of cement paste are explained.									89	2	0	0	1	0	91			0008-8846	1873-3948		WOS:000608762600006

Herein, we demonstrate that intrinsic multicolor fluorescence, covering the whole visible region, can be induced by facile functionalization of CoFe2O4 NPs with Na-tartrate. Moreover, the functionalized CoFe2O4 NPs also show unprecedented catalytic efficiency in the degradation of both biologically and environmentally harmful dyes, pioneering the potential application of these NPs in therapeutics and wastewater treatment. Detailed investigation through various spectroscopic tools unveils the story behind the emergence of this unique optical property of CoFe2O4 NPs upon functionalization with tartrate ligands. We believe our developed multifunctional CoFe2O4 NPs hold great promise for advanced biomedical and technological applications.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000355264500008	25867626

The strong correlation between electrons in d-orbitals and the multivalence nature give rise to a variety of exotic electronic states ranging from insulator to superconductor and cause intriguing phase competition phenomena. Despite a burst of research on the multifarious functionalities in TMOs, little attention has been paid to the formation and integration of an electret a type of quasi-permanent electric field generator useful for nanoscale functional devices as an electric counterpart to permanent magnets. Here, we find that an electret can be created in LaMnO3 thin films by tip-induced electric fields, with a considerable surface height change, via solid-state electrochemical amorphization. The surface charge density of the formed electret area reaches similar to 400 nC cm(-2) and persists without significant charge reduction for more than a year. The temporal evolution of the surface height, charge density, and electric potential are systematically examined by scanning probe microscopy. The underlying mechanism is theoretically analyzed based on a drift-diffusion-reaction model, suggesting that positively charged particles, which are likely protons produced by the dissociation of water, play crucial roles as trapped charges and a catalysis to trigger amorphization. Our finding opens a new horizon for multifunctional TMOs.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1884-4049	1884-4057		WOS:000510703800001

In this work we propose a new route to fabricate nano-hybrid materials able to deliver enhanced photo-catalytic hydrogen evolution, combining within the same nanostructure, a plasmonic antenna nanoparticle and semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). For each stage of our fabrication process we probed the chemical composition of the materials with nanometric spatial resolution, allowing us to demonstrate that the final product is composed of a silver nanoparticle (AgNP) plasmonic core, surrounded by satellite Pt decorated CdS QDs (CdS@Pt), separated by a spacer layer of SiO2 with well-controlled thickness. This new type of photoactive nanomaterial is capable of generating hydrogen when irradiated with visible light, displaying efficiencies 300% higher than the constituting photo-active components. This work may open new avenues for the development of cleaner and more efficient energy sources based on photo-activated hydrogen generation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-4991		WOS:000665977500001	34208469

The abundance sum C+N+O exhibits a range of 0.6 dex, a factor of 4, in contrast to other clusters in which no significant C+N+O spread is found. Such an abundance range offers support for the Cassisi et al. scenario in which the double subgiant branch populations are coeval but with different mixtures of C+N+O abundances. Further, the Na, Al, Zr, and La abundances are correlated with C+N+O, and therefore NGC 1851 is the first cluster to provide strong support for the scenario in which asymptotic giant branch stars are responsible for the globular cluster light element abundance variations.									88	0	0	0	0	0	88			2041-8205	2041-8213		WOS:000264539700014

Our field data indicate that chemical composition of groundwater evolves by various geochemical and microbial processes as it moves deeper into the subsurface. Sequential peaks of Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, and Na+ along flow paths indicate that separation of ions may be driven by cation exchange. Microbial-mediated reactions are important for the formation of several discrete hydrochemical zones containing Fe2+, Mn2+, Sr2+, and SO42- rich groundwaters. Elevated Fe2+, Mn2+, and Sr2+ concentrations may be derived from bacterial iron and manganese reduction. High sulfate concentrations observed a short distance from the recharge may be partly explained by microbial sulfur oxidation and nitrate reduction ( denitrification). The presence of denitrifying and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria in water further supports these reactions. Major ion compositions and deltaD and delta(18)O values are used to determine the source of salinity and the nature of mixing of different groundwaters. Three water types were identified; these include carbonate groundwater, brines associated with evaporites, and groundwater of meteoric origin. Groundwater age differences and flow velocities were calculated using the Cl-36/Cl ratios. Calculated groundwater flow velocities within the Eutaw and Tuscaloosa aquifers are about 0.20 m/yr and 0.15 m/yr, respectively. We modeled basin-scale hydrologic and solute transport processes in a cross section extending from the aquifer outcrops to the Gulf Coast. The modeling result shows that the buried Jurassic Louann Salt can significantly increase groundwater salinity in the overlying coastal plain aquifers by density-driven advection and hydrodynamic dispersion. The modeling results are consistent with Cl/Br ratios and O/H isotope signatures, which indicate that salinity of the groundwater could be derived from seawater that has been evaporated beyond halite saturation. The predicted groundwater flow pattern reveals the mixing of meteoric water, carbonate groundwater ( from the Ordovician Knox Group), and saline brines associated with the Louann Salt. The hydrologic model is consistent with the hydrochemical facies distribution in the Alabama coastal plain.									17	0	0	0	6	0	17			0043-1397	1944-7973		WOS:000186901000001

In particular, the photoelectrocatalysis based solar fuel cell encompass with inexpensive electrocatalyst (hydrogen evolution reaction) is anticipated to support to reduce the overall system cost. However, demonstrating CZTS as Pt-free counter electrode in photoelectrocatalytic fuel cells is scarce. Because, achieving high electronic conductivity, favourable (1 1 2) crystalline structure towards high electrocatalytic property through low cost vacuum-free technique is remains challenge. In this report, we demonstrate p-type CZTS film fabrication at different processing temperature (250, 300, and 350 degrees C) using jet nebulizer spray (JNS) coating technique. The processing temperature play a key role on crystalline property, composition, and catalytic activity of CZTS. The x-ray diffraction and energy dispersive analysis results reveals that the CZTS film prepared 250 degrees C exhibit kesterite structure oriented in (1 1 2) direction. The electrocatalytic reduction property of as-synthesised CZTS electrodes in water reduction process is tested in aqueous 1M NaOH solution. Among the different temperature processed films, CZTS prepared at 250 degrees C result high electrocatalytic reduction activity similar to-2.1 mA cm(-2) at -0.44 V vs Ag/AgCl. In addition, these film exhibits high electrical conductivity than that of other CZTS samples. Therefore, optimised CZTS 250 degrees C film is further examined in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) reduction which result enhanced electrical current generation after adding the 1M of hydrogen peroxide in PBS electrolyte based electrochemical cell. This encouraged to apply as Pt-free counter electrode in H2O2 electrolyte based photoelectrocatalytic fuel cells. The PEC cells encompass with TiO2 nanowire photoelectrode, and CZTS-250 degrees C counter electrode showed feasible photocurrent generation compared to conventional Pt counter electrode. This proof-of-concept type Pt-free PEC cells leads to open new paths in implementing wide-range of semiconductor based electrocatalyst to support in development of low-cost photoelectrocatalytic fuel cells.					2nd International Workshop on Advances on Photocatalysis (AdvPhotoCat-E)2nd International Workshop on Advances on Photocatalysis (AdvPhotoCat-E)	JUL 14-16, 2017JUL 14-16, 2017		Technol Educ Inst Crete, Heraklion, GREECETechnol Educ Inst Crete, Heraklion, GREECE	10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000452782100112

In this work, we conducted detailed first-principles calculations to acquire a deep understanding of the alkaline HOR mechanism on PtNi bulk alloys [Pt3Ni(111), Pt2Ni2(111), and PtNi3(111)] and its surface alloy [PtNisurf(111)]. The full free energy profiles suggest that the HOR on PtNi alloys proceeds via the Tafel-Volmer mechanism, that is, the direct decomposition of H-2 into two adsorbed H, followed by its reaction with OH- in the electrolyte, as the rate-determining step, to form H2O. Therefore, the HOR activity of PtNi alloys is solely impacted by the adsorption of hydrogen, rather than hydroxyl species, though the oxophilicity is also enhanced by alloying Pt with Ni. Thermodynamically, a moderate H adsorption free energy, Delta G(H)* approximate to 0.414 eV, is calculated to be an optimal candidate for the HOR at pH = 13. Alloying Pt with Ni can elevate the d-band center (epsilon(d)), push the value of Delta G(H)* closer to 0.414 eV, and thus lower the free energy barrier (E-a) of the rate-determining Volmer reaction, leading to the highest HOR activity of PtNi3(111) among all considered PtNi alloys. This situation is further confirmed by both the microkinetic model and the Tafel plot, where PtNi3(111) exhibits the highest reaction rate (r = 9.42 x 10(3) s(-1) site(-1)) and the largest exchange current density (i(0) = 1.42 mA cm(-2)) for HOR in alkaline media. This work provides a fundamental understanding of the HOR mechanism and theoretical guidance for rational design of electrocatalysts for HOR in alkaline media.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000571433500030	32808752

URI is a member of the amidohydrolase superfamily (AHS), a highly divergent group of enzymes that catalyze primarily hydrolytic reactions. The chemical mechanism and active site structure of URI were investigated in an attempt to improve our understanding of how an active site template that apparently evolved to catalyze hydrolytic reactions has been reforged to catalyze an isomerization reaction. The pH-rate profiles for k(cat) and k(cat)/K-m for URI from Escherichia coli. are bell-shaped and indicate that one group must be unprotonated and another residue must be protonated For catalytic activity. Primary isotope effects on the kinetic constants with [2-H-2]-D-glucuronate and the effects of changes in solvent viscosity are consistent with product release being the rate-limiting step. The X-ray structure of Bh0493, a URI from Bacillus halodurans, was determined in the presence of the Substrate D-glucuronate. The bound complex showed that the mononuclear metal center in the active site is ligated to the C-6 carboxylate and the C-5 hydroxyl group of the substrate. This hydroxyl group is also hydrogen bonded to Asp-355 in the same orientation as the hydroxide or water is bound in those members of the AHS that catalyze hydrolytic reactions. In addition, the C-2 and C-3 hydroxyl groups of the substrate are hydrogen bonded to Arg-357 and the carbonyl group at C-1 is hydrogen bonded to Tyr-50. A chemical mechanism is proposed that utilizes a proton transfer from C-2 Of D-glucuronate to C-1 that is initiated by the combined actions of Asp-355 from the end of beta-strand 8 and the C-5 hydroxyl of the substrate that is bound to the metal ion. The formation of the proposed cis-enediol intermediate is further facilitated by the shuttling of the proton between the C-2 and G I oxygens by the conserved Tyr-50 and/or Arg-355.									9	1	0	0	8	0	10			0006-2960			WOS:000269702200015	19678710	
J	Hemingway, Jordon D.; Henkes, Gregory A.					Henkes, Gregory/0000-0002-4259-157X			A disordered kinetic model for clumped isotope bond reordering in carbonates								EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS				566						116962	10.1016/j.epsl.2021.116962		APR 2021		JUL 15 2021	2021	Carbonate clumped isotopes (Delta(47)) have become a widely applied method for paleothermometry, with applications spanning many environmental settings over hundreds of millions of years. However, Delta(47)-based paleothermometry can be complicated by closure temperature-like behavior whereby C-O bonds are reset at elevated diagenetic or metamorphic temperatures, sometimes without obvious mineral alteration. Laboratory studies have constrained this phenomenon by heating well-characterized materials at various temperatures, observing temporal Delta(47) evolution, and fitting results to kinetic models with prescribed C-O bond reordering mechanisms. While informative, these models are inflexible regarding the nature of isotope exchange, leading to potential uncertainties when extrapolated to geologic timescales. Here, we instead propose that observed reordering rates arise naturally from random-walk O-18 diffusion through the carbonate lattice, and we develop a "disordered" kinetic framework that treats C-O bond reordering as a continuum of first-order processes occurring in parallel at different rates. We show theoretically that all previous models are specific cases of disordered kinetics; thus, our approach reconciles the transient defect/equilibrium defect and paired reaction-diffusion models. We estimate the rate coefficient distributions from published heating experiment data by finding a regularized inverse solution that best fits each Delta(47) timeseries without assuming a particular functional form a priori. Resulting distributions are well-approximated as lognormal for all experiments on calcite or dolomite; aragonite experiments require more complex distributions that are consistent with a change in oxygen bonding environment during the transition to calcite. Presuming lognormal rate coefficient distributions and Arrhenius-like temperature dependence yields an underlying activation energy, E, distribution that is Gaussian with a mean value of mu(E) = 224.3 +/- 27.6 kJ mol(-1) and a standard deviation of sigma(E) = 17.4 +/- 0.7 kJ mol(-1) (+/- 1 sigma uncertainty; n = 24) for calcite and mu E = 230.3 +/- 47.7 kJ mol(-1) and sigma(E) = 14.8 +/- 2.2 kJ mol(-1) (Ti = 4) for dolomite. These model results are adaptable to other minerals and may provide a basis for future experiments whereby the nature of carbonate C-O bonds is altered (e.g., by inducing mechanical strain or cation substitution). Finally, we apply our results to geologically relevant heating/cooling histories and suggest that previous models underestimate low-temperature alteration but overestimate Delta(47) blocking temperatures.

The results show that the -Fe2O3 nanowires after calcined at 550 degrees C present hollow-pipe-like structure and good photocatalytic degradation of RhB and water splitting to produce O-2 evolution. Based the -Fe2O3 nanowires, the -Fe2O3/Ag3PO4 nanocomposites were fabricated using ion exchange method, and the water splitting results show that the formation of the heterojunction between -Fe2O3 nanowires and Ag3PO4 particles can effectively promote electron-hole separation and then improve the photocatalytic activity.

While no hyperfine structure is observed at 4 GHz, the signal shows little narrowing and may mask underlying hyperfine structure. At 16 GHz, the signal shows g-anisotropy and a shift in g-components. The middle Kramers doublet of a near rhombic S = 5/2 system is found to be the only possible origin consistent with the frequency dependence of the signal. Computer simulations incorporating underlying hyperfine structure from an Mn monomer or dimer are employed to characterize the system. The low zero field splitting (ZFS) of D = 0.43 cm-1 and near rhombicity of E/D = 0.25 lead to the observed X-band g value of 4.1. Treatment with F- or NH3, which compete with Cl- for a binding site, increases the ZFS and rhombicity of the signal. These results indicate that the origin of the OEC signal at g = 4 is either an Mn(II) monomer or a coupled Mn multimer. The likelihood of a multimer is favored over that of a monomer.									82	0	0	0	39	0	82			0006-3002			WOS:A1992HE18500003	1310873

CdS is naturally n-type because of the presence of sulphur vacancies and in most of the observed samples, a donor-acceptor pair involving the sulfur vacancies could be identified at 1.65 eV. Different complexes emissions could be identified depending on the deposition technique and post-growth treatment. The best efficiencies were measured on CdTe/CdS based solar cells for which the CdS layer presents an excitonic donor bound PL peak as well as an emission corresponding to interstitial cadmium.

Craddock, Paul/0000-0003-4702-0204			Evolution of Kerogen and Bitumen during Thermal Maturation via Semi-Open Pyrolysis Investigated by Infrared Spectroscopy								ENERGY & FUELS				29	4			2197	2210		10.1021/ef5027532				APR 2015	2015	A series of artificial maturation (anhydrous, semi-open pyrolysis) experiments on Green River oil shale have been performed to simulate the thermal maturation of type I kerogen. The goals of this program were to develop a kinetic model of petroleum generation from oil shale and to characterize the yield and composition of petroleum as a function of artificial thermal maturity. The thermal maturity level (EASY%Ro = 0.48-1.28%) is based upon the kinetic model of kerogen degradation and is equivalent to vitrinite reflectance maturity. Here, we compare the structural characteristics of kerogen and bitumen during artificial maturation of oil shale using quantitative Fourier transform infrared (IR) spectroscopy. Quantitative comparison was enabled by a novel method for the preparation of bitumen for IR spectroscopy. Bitumen can be a reaction intermediate during maturation of kerogen, and the IR data indicate that bitumen has a structure intermediate between that of kerogen and generated petroleum. Moreover, the IR data reveal that the composition of bitumen changes with maturity, with trends that are similar in some aspects to those observed previously in kerogen, but different in others. Kerogen is characterized by the early depletion of oxygenated functional groups prior to petroleum generation (EASY%Ro < 0.9%) and then a late enrichment of oxygen at higher artificial maturity (EASY%Ro > 1.2%). In contrast, bitumen shows initial enrichment of oxygenated functional groups at low artificial maturity (EASY%Ro < 0.8%) and subsequent depletion at higher maturity. Kerogen evolution follows the previously observed trend with aliphatic carbon chains that became shorter and/or more branched as kerogen is consumed during all stages of artificial maturation. Bitumen, in contrast, appears to have aliphatic carbon chains that lengthen within the same artificial maturity range as bitumen is predominantly generated from kerogen. The aliphatic carbon content of bitumen is greater than that of kerogen at all levels of artificial maturity. Both kerogen and bitumen become more aromatic in character with increasing thermal maturity, especially above artificial levels EASY%Ro > 0.9%. This similarity likely results from loss of aliphatic chains from both organic fractions during petroleum generation, suggesting that both kerogen and bitumen can be direct sources for petroleum. The loss of aliphatic carbons from aromatic centers in both kerogen and bitumen leads to protonation of the residual aromatic rings. The IR spectra of kerogen and bitumen indicate very similar degrees of protonation of those aromatic rings.									98	7	1	0	5	0	104			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000353251800016

To test this prediction, we have investigated the nucleosynthesis of Al-26 during hot hydrogen burning along temperature-density-time profiles obtained from hydrodynamic simulations of nova outbursts. We find that we can predict the yield of Al-26 if we characterize the thermonuclear runaway by means of two parameters: (1) the peak temperature and (2) the time required by the nova to reach peak temperature. We provide yields of Al-26 in terms of these parameters. We have also found that the yield of Al-26 is directly proportional to the abundances of the heavy elements so that about 20% of the initial Mg-24 is converted into Al-26. Therefore, we are also able to show that the dominant contributor of Al-26 to the Galaxy must be novae which occur on oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarfs. However, we also find that the class of novae that should be the most important contributors to Galactic nucleosynthesis of Al-26 may not have been discovered but must exist.									62	1	0	0	0	0	62			0004-637X			WOS:A1991EY63700014

However, the relatively low conductivity and utilization of active sites severely hinder its commercial application for H-2 and O-2 generation. Therefore, carbon substrates have been used to construct carbon-based transition metal sulfides/selenides for improving the dispersion and charge transfer rate of active sites. Herein, the research progress and all kinds of carbon-based transition metal sulfides/selenides have been systematically summarized and discussed. Moreover, various of strategies for boosting the properties of transition metal sulfides, selenides and sulfoselenides such as carbon substrate design, nanostructure construction, ion doping and surface engineering in terms of active sites are introduced in detail. Finally, this review briefly summarizes the challenges and research direction of carbon-based transition metal sulfur selenides for electrocatalytic water splitting, providing new inspiration for the rational design of high-performance catalysts.

Among the prepared catalysts, the one prepared at a heating and cooling rate of 2 degrees C min(-1) in N-2 atmosphere (designated NiFeCo-N-2-2 degrees C) displays the best catalytic properties after stability testing, exhibiting a high current density (9.06 mA cm(-2) at 320 mV), low Tafel slope (72.9 mV dec(-1)), good stability (over 20 h), high turnover frequency (0.304 s(-1)), and high mass activity (46.52 A g(-1) at 320 mV). Stability tests reveal that the hydroxide phase is less suitable for long-term use than catalysts with an oxide phase. Two causes are identified for the loss of stability in the hydroxide phase: a) Modeling of the distribution function of relaxation times (DFRT) reveals the increase in resistance contributed by various relaxation processes; b) density functional theory (DFT) surface energy calculations reveal that the higher surface energy of the hydroxide-phase catalyst impairs the stability. These findings represent a new strategy to optimize catalysts for water splitting.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000621053300001	33561301

Increasing pressure yielded a denser Al2O3 film and a thinner SiOx interlayer, but only slightly affected the Al2O3 film thickness. The diffusivity of O atoms was evaluated by using time-averaged emission intensities of the He I and O I lines. The consumption rate of O radicals and the production rate of H radicals, as functions of plasma exposure time, were deduced from analyzing temporal evolutions of emission intensities of the O I and H-alpha lines, respectively. The amounts of C and H impurities in the film were confirmed by using an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Finally, the mechanisms by which the working pressure affected the properties of Al2O3 films were discussed based on the experimental results.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0272-4324	1572-8986		WOS:000370721800019

However, the high surface reactivity of these materials results in side reactions during improper storage and notable gas release when the cell is charged beyond 4.3 V vs L+/Li-0. Therefore, in this study, we embark on a comprehensive investigation on the moisture sensitivity of LiNi0.85Co0.1Mn0.05O2 by aging it in a controlled environment at a constant room-temperature relative humidity of 63% up to 1 year. We quantitatively analyze the gassing of the aged samples by online electrochemical mass spectrometry and further depict plausible reaction pathways, accounting for the origin of the gas release. Transmission electron microscopy reveals formation of an amorphous surface impurity layer of ca. 10 nm in thickness, as a result of continuous reactions with moisture and CO2 from the air. Underneath it, there is another reconstructed layer of ca. 20 nm in thickness, showing rock salt/spinel-like features. Our results provide insight into the complex interfacial degradation phenomena and future directions for the development of high-performance Ni-rich layered oxides.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000787373300025	35271266	
J	Calzaferri, G				Calzaferri, Gion/AAQ-6603-2021	Calzaferri, Gion/0000-0003-0854-497X			Artificial antenna systems								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INDIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES-CHEMICAL SCIENCES				109	6			429	446						DEC 1997	1997	The work describes experimental and theoretical results on the water oxidation in absence of an externally added potential, on the charge transport in organized microporous media and on the transport of excitation energy in an antenna system. Water oxidation to O-2 takes place at the solid/water phase boundary of a thin AgCl layer in the presence of a small excess of Ag+. This water oxidation step shows self-sensitization as the reaction proceeds, the sensitivity is extended from the near-UV-visible towards the red range. The quantum yield per redox equivalent for O-2 evolution upon illumination with near UV light (340-390 nm) is similar to 0.8 and it is the same upon illumination with blue light (420-480 nm). In the green range it is similar to 0.5. We discuss parameters controlling these reactions. Zeolite microcrystals are investigated as hosts for supramolecular organization of clusters, complexes and molecules. The possibility to arrange zeolite microcrystals of good quality and narrow size distribution as dense monograin layers on different types of substrates allows the discovery of specific properties. In the present context, three functionalities are of special importance intrazeolite ion transport, intrazeolite charge transport and intrazeolite excitation energy transport. All of them have been clearly demonstrated experimentally although there are still some controversies going on. Highly concentrated dyes have the tendency to form aggregates which generally show very fast radiationless decay. In natural antenna systems the formation of aggregates is prevented by fencing the chlorophyll molecules in polypeptide cages. A similar approach is possible by enclosing dyes inside a microporous material such that the volume of the cages and channels is able to uptake monomers only, but not aggregates. We know a number of materials bearing linear channels running through the whole microcrystal which allow the formation of highly anisotropic, monomeric dye assemblies. A few cases based on zeolite L as a host and the cationic dye molecules pyronine and oxonine have been investigated experimentally to some extent for this purpose. While the molecules can penetrate the channels, the geometrical constraints of this system excludes aggregation and therefore self-quenching up to very high concentrations, namely 0.2 M. Microcrystals with cylinder morphology and a size in the range of 100 nm have been found to be optimal for realizing collection efficiencies in order of 99%.

Nonetheless, the poor electrical conductivity hinders their further practical applications in supercapacitors. Herein, CoAl LDH flower-like hollow microspheres are decorated with Ag nanoparticles by a facile one-step solvothermal reaction, followed by chemical bath deposition reaction. Experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that decorating Ag nanoparticles onto CoAl LDH not only reduces the energy band gap and enhances their electrical conductivity, but also promotes fast diffusion kinetics of electrolyte ions and electrochemical reaction activity. Consequently, the prepared Ag/CoAl LDH electrode demonstrates improved specific capacities of 1214 (825) C g(-1) at 3 (30) A g(-1) and 91% capacity retention over 10,000 cycles at 10 A g(-1) compared to the pristine CoAl LDH electrode. Moreover, using Ag/CoAl LDH and N-doped carbon nanotubes as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively, the assembled hybrid capacitor device delivers an energy density of 61.2 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 800 W kg(-1). This work may showcase a great promise of engineering conductive nanoparticles-decorated LDHs-based active materials towards high-performance supercapacitors. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

J	Hamaoka, Fukutaro; Yagisawa, Takashi; Makabe, Toshiaki								Numerical investigation of relationship between micro-scale pattern, interfacial plasma structure and feature profile during deep-Si etching in two-frequency capacitively coupled plasmas in SF6/O-2								JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS				42	7					075201	10.1088/0022-3727/42/7/075201				APR 7 2009	2009	The feature profile of deep-Si etching in the presence of plasma moulding in two-frequency capacitively coupled plasmas in SF6/O-2 has been numerically simulated to investigate the relationship between the micro-scale pattern on a Si wafer, the interfacial structure of the plasma (i.e. the sheath) and the etching profile. We have also discussed the deep-Si etching profile as functions of the SF6/O-2 gas mixture ratio and the total gas pressure. The result shows that the plasma moulding has no influence on the sheath structure when the sheath thickness is an order of magnitude longer than the width of the hole pattern. In the presence of a large number of F radicals, the chemical etching of Si causes isotropic etching with a significant undercut profile, reducing the plasma moulding's influence on the etching profile due to the F radicals' much higher Si etching rate compared with the rate of etching by ions. On the other hand, with the increase in the oxygen mixture ratio, a passivation layer grows up on the inside wall, and the removal of the layer at the bottom corner is strengthened by the distorted ion by plasma moulding. Thus, the etching is enhanced particularly at the bottom corner. As the pattern width decreases and the oxygen mixture ratio increases, the etching profile becomes anisotropic by the formation of the passivation layer at the sidewall. In addition, the bottom profile becomes flat because of the uniform ion flux under the reduced influence of the plasma moulding.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000264385900020

Detailed and complete elastic angular distributions have been measured at the Strasbourg Vivitron accelerator at several energies covering the energy range between 5 and 10 MeV per nucleon, The clastic scattering angular distributions show the usual diffraction pattern and also. at larger angles, refractive effects in the form of nuclear rainbow and associated Airy structures. The optical model analysis unambiguously the evolution of the refractive scattering pattern. The observed structure, namely the Airy minima, can be consistently described by a nucleus-nucleus potential with a deep real part and a weakly absorptive imaginary part. The difference in absorption in the two systems is explained by an increased imaginary (mostly surface) part of the potential in the O-18 + C-12 system. The relation between the obtained potentials and those reported for the symmetrical O-16 + O-16 and C-12 + C-12 systems is drawn.									32	0	0	0	0	0	32			0556-2813	1089-490X		WOS:000172733000043		
J	Noguchi, T; Inoue, Y; Tang, XS				Noguchi, Takumi/I-7105-2014				Structural coupling between the oxygen-evolving Mn cluster and a tyrosine residue in photosystem II as revealed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy								BIOCHEMISTRY				36	48			14705	14711		10.1021/bi971760y				DEC 2 1997	1997	The flash-induced Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectrum of the oxygen-evolving Mn cluster upon S-1-to-S-2 transition (S-2/S-1 spectrum) was measured using photosystem II (PS II) core complexes of Synechocystis 6803 in which tyrosine residues were specifically labeled with C-13 at the ring-4 position. The double-difference spectrum between the unlabeled and labeled S-2/S-1 spectra showed that the bands at 1254 and 1521 cm(-1) downshifted by 25 and 15 cm(-1), respectively, upon ring-4-C-13-Tyr labeling. This observation indicates that there is a tyrosine residue coupled to the Mn cluster, and the vibrational modes of this tyrosine are affected upon St formation. From a comparison of the above band positions and isotopic shifts in the S-2/S-1 spectrum with those of the FTIR spectra of tyrosine in aqueous solution at pH 0.6 (Tyr-OH) and pH 13.4 (Tyr-O-) and of the Y-D(.)/Y-D FTIR difference spectrum, the 1254 and 1521 cm(-1) bands were assigned to the CO stretching and ring CC stretching modes of tyrosine, respectively, and this tyrosine was suggested to be protonated in PS II. The observation that the effect of the S-2 formation on the tyrosine bands appeared as a decrease in intensity with little frequency change could not be explained by a simple electrostatic effect by Mn oxidation, suggesting that the Mn cluster and a tyrosine are linked via chemical and/or hydrogen bonds and the structural changes of the Mn cluster are transmitted to the tyrosine through these bonds, On the basis of previous EPR studies that showed close proximity of Y-Z to the Mn cluster, Y-Z was proposed as the most probable candidate for the above tyrosine, This is the first demonstration of the structural coupling between Y-Z and the Mn cluster in an intact oxygen-evolving complex, This structural coupling may facilitate electron transfer from the Mn cluster to Yz. Our observation also provides an experimental support in favor of the proton or hydrogen atom abstraction model for the Y-Z function.									89	0	0	0	69	0	89			0006-2960			WOS:A1997YJ70900012	9398190	
J	Samland, M								Modeling the evolution of disk galaxies. II. Yields of massive stars								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				496	1			155	171		10.1086/305368				MAR 20 1998	1998	Checking stellar yields with galactic chemical evolution models is an important test of stellar nucleosynthesis simulations. This is generally done by applying a very simple galactic model with a large number of free parameters. It is, however, at least questionable whether such a model can serve as a dependable test of stellar nucleosynthesis. A self-consistent galactic model, on the other hand, can be used to determine yields that are consistent with the galactic chemical evolution. The chemodynamical model introduced in this paper includes a detailed description of the stellar metal-dependent enrichment and serves to determine the chemical yields of massive stars. It shows that the metal dependency of stellar nucleosynthesis, gas hows in the galaxy, mixing processes in the interstellar medium, and the energy release of supernovae (SNe) have a great influence on the distribution of chemical elements. From the chemodynamical model and the observed evolution of [alpha/Fe], I find that on average, one out of 195 intermediate-mass stars explodes as a SN of Type Ia. This yields a ratio of Type Ia SN to Type LT + Ib SN of 1:8.5. Furthermore, the model predicts present SN rates in our Galaxy for Types Ia and II + Ib of 1/107 yr and 1/41 yr, respectively. I present Galactic yields of 23 different chemical elements from C to Ni. One important result is that the yields of Cr, Fe, and Ni are a factor of 2 too high, and odd-z element yields are systematically underestimated in the nucleosynthesis models of massive stars. A comparison of the stellar with the Galactic yields suggests that the lower mass limit for stars to become Type II SNe may be 11 M-., and that the core collapse of stars more massive than 30-40 M-. produces a black hole. The model predicts 1.2-1.5 x 10(9) stellar remnants of massive stars (neutron stars and black holes) in our Galaxy.									127	1	5	0	0	0	132			0004-637X			WOS:000072782900013

The redox potential of LiMnPO4 cathode is close to the electrolyte decomposition, which provides an ideal scenario to study multiple reactions on a single electrode surface involving parallel steps and species transformation in both solid and liquid state. Different processes were deconvoluted using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. In addition, a surface coverage model was employed to theoretically quantify the limiting step of the electrochemical process. The results show the addition of MWCNTs increased the electrical conductivity of the cathode and improved the intercalation process in LiMnPO4. The optimal concentrations of MWCNTs, which enhanced the electrical properties and decreased the water oxidation effect, were 20 and 40 wt.%.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1870-249X	1665-9686		WOS:000496750400005

The g-C3N4-based material was found to be a metal-free photocatalyst useful for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol with dioxygen as the oxidant under visible light irradiation. Acid modification had a significant influence on the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4. Among all acid tested, sulfuric acid-modified g-C3N4 showed the highest catalytic activity and gave benzaldehyde in 23% yield for 4 h under visible light irradiation, which was about 2.5 times higher than that of g-C3N4. The acid modification effectively improved surface area, reduced structural size, enlarged band gap, enhanced surface chemical state, and facilitated photoinduced charge separation, contributing to the enhanced photocatalytic activity. It is hoped that our work can open promising prospects for the utilization of metal free g-C3N4-based semiconductor as visible-light photocatalyst for selective organic transformation.

Herein, we report a supramolecular starch-assisted confinement-assembly-pyrolysis (SCAP) strategy for the synthesis of ultrasmall Rh2P nanoparticles with high dispersion and low loading anchored on N,P-doped porous carbon (NPC). The Rh2P/NPC composite exhibits an unprecedented HER activity with small overpotentials at 10 mA cm(-2) (40 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 17 mV in 1 M KOH), as well as superior stability in both acidic and alkaline media. In addition, the Rh2P/NPC catalyst also exhibits an excellent HER performance in the entire pH range. Especially, the Rh2P/NPC catalyst shows an electrocatalytic HER activity superior to that of a 20% Pt/C catalyst in natural seawater, especially under large current densities. It only needs 160, 341 and 411 mV versus RHE to achieve current densities of 10, 100, and 300 mA cm(-2), respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this Rh2P/NPC material is the best electrocatalyst reported thus far for seawater electrolysis. Moreover, the Rh2P/NPC catalyst also shows good stability over a wide range of current densities. All these results indicate that the Rh2P/NPC catalyst can be used as a robust catalyst for hydrogen production via direct seawater electrolysis. In situ X-ray absorption spectra revealed the strong interaction between the Rh-P site and H2O during the HER catalytic process in 1 M KOH, revealing the positive role of the Rh-P site in the HER. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the strong synergistic effects between Rh2P nanoparticles and NPC modify the electronic structure to accelerate the HER kinetics. More interestingly, the SCAP strategy not only yields a robust and pH-universal HER catalyst, but also enables a general, green, and gram-scale synthesis of other metal phosphides.									12	1	0	0	2	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000601282900018

Herein, the role of NiP nanoparticles as co -catalysts for enhancing the charge transfer mechanism towards photocatalytic hydrogen generation is explored. A general chemical deposition strategy is adopted for the controlled surface anchoring of NiP cocatalyst onto the photocatalytic system, and the obtained NiP anchored photocatalyst is found to exhibit superior photocatalytic performance towards visible light driven water splitting. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the synergistic interaction of NiP cocatalysts to facilitate strong electronic interactions at the heterojunctions, which are beneficial for the rapid transfer of photogenerated electrons to protons. The present approach may widen the horizon for design of many other noblemetal-free metal phosphides as highly efficient cocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen generation.

Herein, polymeric carbon nitride with frustrated-Lewis-pairs was constructed by intercalation of electron-deficient boron (B) into metal-free carbon nitride. NH3-temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and pyridine-adsorption diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) results demonstrated that B heteroatoms (Lewis acid) and proximal amino groups (Lewis base) were more likely to form frustrated Lewis pairs, which would capture, activate and reduce N(2)to NH(3)through a "pull-push" effect. Molybdenum-based oxide was further employed as a co-catalyst to improve the charge separation efficiency of site-engineered photocatalysts. The synergistic effect between intercalated B and defective MoO(2)resulted in an 8-fold increased photoactivity of carbon nitride for N(2)fixation.

Herein, a new mechanical, solvent-free method for fabricating electrodes for OER is described in which a electroactive material under test, mixed with a small amount of PTFE powder (ca. 10 wt%), is pressed onto Pt powder to create a permanent, robust electrode that can be used in a rotating disc electrode set-up. This new method of fabricating electrodes is compared to the well-known dropcast on Glassy Carbon (GC) method, using commercially available materials: RuO2, Co3O4 and NiO. The results show that the mechanical route produces much better OER performances, in terms of overpotential and stability, for the commercial metal oxide on the pressed discs when compared to the dropcast GC method. Finally, it is shown that this mechanical, high surface area, solvent-free electrode fabrication technique can also be achieved using silver, rather than platinum, as the conducting, support material.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000415112500001

The physicochernical properties of the Re-PbO2 electrodes were analyzed by spectral methods and electrochemical measurements. The surface morphology of the Re-PbO2 electrodes held the characteristics of the dopants and the crystal grain of PbO, The crystal structure of the PbO2 electrodes was also influenced by doping with different rare earth oxides. The presence of Er,03 and La,03 in the PbO2 films could enhance the direct anodic oxidation, which was helpful to mineralize 4-chlorophenol. The 4-chlorophenol decay on the Re-PbO2 electrodes was analyzed and good fitting was found using the relation for the pseudo-first order reaction. Of the electrodes examined, the Er-PbO2 electrode exhibited the best performance for the degradation of 4-chlorophenol. The removal rates of COD and 4-chlorophenol during the 9 h electrolysis at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) were 80.7 and 100%, respectively, with the current efficiency being 16.0-10.1%.

J	Rushmer, T					Rushmer, Tracy/0000-0003-0192-2384			Volume change during partial melting reactions: implications for melt extraction, melt geochemistry and crustal rheology								TECTONOPHYSICS				342	3-4	SI		389	405		10.1016/S0040-1951(01)00172-X				DEC 2001	2001	The volume change associated with dehydration melting has been investigated experimentally in muscovite and biotite-bearing assemblages because it is a possible driving force for melt segregation during orogenesis. Experiments have been performed on cores of a muscovite + biotite-bearing pelite and on a biotite + plagioclase + quartz gneiss. The muscovite + biotite-bearing pelite produced a similar set of melt-filled cracks to that observed in muscovite-bearing quartzite under partial melting conditions of 700 MPa, and 850 and 900 degreesC. However, no cracking was observed in the biotite gneiss under a range of temperature conditions (700 MPa, 800-900 degreesC. The textures of the partially melted rock samples suggest the volume change and associated dilational strain accompanying melting in assemblages with only biotite is insignificant or negative. This is confirmed by calculations of the dilational strain in the biotite gneiss experiments and other experiments in the literature. For example, the dilational strain associated with partial melting of biotite-bearing metagreywacke assemblages ranges from + 1.90% to - 12.24% (given 30% modal biotite, calculated on a 1-oxygen basis), becoming negative when gamet is produced at higher pressure. In contrast, the dilational strain associated with melt-induced cracking in a muscovite-bearing metapelite is higher, + 6.76%, for the same modal abundance. These results suggest that volume change alone is not an important driving force for melt segregation in biotite-only-bearing assemblages, and external deformation at higher melt fractions may be required to segregate melt from the lower crust during partial melting. Reaction-controlled segregation is possible in muscovite-bearing rocks and melt will be more easily expelled in the upper to mid levels of the crust because of rapid pore pressure development during early stages of melting. Major element chemistry of melt in the two-mica assemblage is dominated by muscovite melting, even when assemblage contains reacting biotite. Some implications of these results are that: (1) the melt that escapes at low melt volumes from the mid-crust is likely to have a muscovite-melting chemical signature; and (2) in the lower portions of the crust where melting is controlled by biotite stability, melt may become trapped within and along grains and remain distributed, pervasively, at the grain scale until greater melt fractions are generated. Recent modeling of orogenic belts shows that the evolution of collisional belts likely involves the prolonged presence of a weak crustal layer. Melt trapped along grain boundaries from low dilational strain melting reactions may be a mechanism for keeping melt in the crust and weakening it during active orogenesis.

The mechanistic understandings are currently gained from equilibrium thermodynamics, such as atomic scale density functional theory calculations, in terms of segregation energy, interaction energy and elastic energy. Herein, we have developed a micro-scale phase-field model framework that describes the kinetics and microstructure evolutions of the B-site segregation and nanoparticle exsolution from the A1 xBO3 d surface. The model was derived in a thermodynamically consistent manner by employing a ternary regular-solution freeenergy functional and Cahn-Hilliard kinetic equations. The key hypothesis is that the B-site nanoparticle is exsolved by a spinodal decomposition once the surface region of A1 xBO3 d is driven to the spinodal region of the free-energy functional via B-site segregation to the surface and/or via expansion of the chemical spinodal region. The effects of oxygen partial pressure (or electric polarization), B-site supersaturation (or A-site deficiency), and segregation energy have been explicitly investigated, and the results obtained agree qualitatively with the experimental observations. The proposed model can serve as a multi-scale bridge that ties the atomic-scale understandings to the micro-scale observations and has the potential to be used for the design and optimization of nano-architectures of A1 xBO3 d materials.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000471025900067	30896683

The ratios were obtained for a sample of local C- and O-rich asymptotic giant branch and supergiant stars from observations of the C-12 and C-13 isotopologues of CO and CN, respectively. The J = 1 -> 0 transitions of both molecules were observed at lambda = 3 mm using the ARO 12 m telescope, while the J = 2 -> 1 lines of the two species were measured using the ARO Sub-Millimeter Telescope (SMT) at lambda = 1 mm. The C-12/C-13 ratios were determined from the CO data by modeling both transitions simultaneously with a circumstellar radiative transfer code, which can account for the high opacities present in the emission from this species. In the case of CN, the hyperfine structure was used to evaluate opacity effects. Ratios obtained independently from CO and CN are in good agreement. For the C- rich envelopes, the ratios fall in the range C-12/C-13 similar to 25-90, while the O-rich shells have values of 10-35. Ratios of C-12/C-13 similar to 3-14 are found for the supergiant stars, with the exception of VY CMa, where the values lie in the range 25-46. All ratios obtained in this study are <= 89, the solar value, suggesting that substantial carbon-13 enrichment may be currently occurring in the local interstellar medium. A qualitative model was constructed based on first and third dredge-up convective mixing that can reproduce the observed ratios. Substantial mixing of H-burning products must occur to explain the ratios in the O-rich objects, while a wide range of C-12/C-13 values can be generated by only a few percent mixing of He-burning ashes in the C-rich case. The C-12/C-13 ratios obtained in this study should help improve stellar yield models and contribute to the understanding of Galactic chemical evolution.									61	0	0	0	0	0	61			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000262726600066

The mode of inhibition was studied, and individual binding sites were assigned by steady-state O-2 evolution measurements in correlation with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results. Two binding sites were found for acetate, one chloride-sensitive on the electron donor side and one chloride-insensitive on the electron acceptor side. The respective binding constants were as follows: K-Cl = 0.5 +/- 0.2 mM (chloride binding to the donor side), K-I = 16 +/- 5 mM (acetate binding to the donor side), and K-I' = 130 +/- 40 mM (acetate binding to the acceptor side). When acetate was bound to the acceptor side of PSII, 200 K illumination induced a narrowed form of the Q(A)-Fe-II EPR signal, the yield of which was independent of the chloride concentration. When acetate was bound to the donor side, room-temperature illumination produced the S2Yz. state. EPR measurements showed that both the yield and formation rate of this state increased with acetate concentration, increasing chloride concentrations slowed the rate of formation of the S2Yz. state, but did not affect the steady-state yield of the S2Yz. state. These findings indicate that the light-induced reactions in acetate-inhibited PSII are modulated by both donor side and acceptor side binding of acetate, while the steady-state yield of the S2Yz(.) state at the high PSII concentrations used for EPR measurements depends primarily on acceptor side turnover. Our data further support a close proximity of chloride to Y-z(.), indicating a possible role for chloride in the electron transfer mechanism at the O-2-evolving complex.									49	0	0	0	34	0	49			0006-2960			WOS:000080593700027	10350479

XPS analysis illustrated that torrefaction in CO2 suppressed the conversion of pyrrole-N (N-5) to quaternary-N (N-Q), whereas the trend for an O-2 atmosphere moved in the opposite direction. During cocombustion, the impact on NO emission reduction shifted from positive to negative as the pretreatment temperature was raised, which is closely related to the six elementary reactions involving the intermediacy of NCO and NH, as well as to heterogeneous reduction of NO with char. In addition, torrefaction in a N-2/O-2 atmosphere at a lower temperature of 250 degrees C improved the properties of biomass and achieved the lowest NO emission during co-combustion, which provides the supporting theory needed for using effluent in power plants as a torrefaction medium.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			0960-8524	1873-2976		WOS:000672807600013	34082335

Toray carbon cloth is selected as cathode, which serves as large-porosity electrodes with an approximately planar reaction surface. Imaging analysis shows film formation of precipitates is observed in all the experiments. In addition, toroidal and aggregate morphologies are present under lower currents as well. Specially, toroidal or partially toroidal deposit is observed for 0.06 A/cm(2). Aggregates, which consist of small particles with grain boundaries, are shown for 0.03 A/cm(2). We found that the film-resistor model is unable to predict the discharge voltage behaviors under the two lower currents due to the presence of the deposit morphologies other than the film formation. The coverage model's prediction shows acceptable agreement with the experimental data because the model accounts for impacts of various morphologies of precipitates.

This hypothesis is supported by experiments at 400-800-degrees-C on {010} surfaces of San Carlos olivine exposed to C-O-H gases generated by the decomposition of oxalic acid and oxalic acid dihydrate. Carbonaceous films form readily on these surfaces and achieve thicknesses comparable to those observed in natural samples (a few nanometers) in a matter of minutes. At relatively oxidizing conditions, the carbonaceous films consist principally of C-C and C-H bonded species with lesser amounts of C-O bonded species. At relatively reducing conditions, the carbonaceous films consist of subequal amounts of C-C/C-H, C-O, and metal-C species. Aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons and other thermally labile organic species are associated with carbonaceous films in some natural samples but none were detected in experimental samples from this study, leaving open the question of abiotic synthesis of organic matter on crack surfaces in basalts. Regardless, it is clear from the preliminary experiments reported here that crack surfaces in olivine (and probably other silicate minerals and glasses) are capable of stabilizing compounds that otherwise would not be stable in cool					SYMP ON SURVIVABILITY OF ORGANIC MATTER AT HIGH TEMPERATURES : IMPLICATIONS FOR LIFE, AT THE 1991 ANNUAL MEETING OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOC OF AMERICASYMP ON SURVIVABILITY OF ORGANIC MATTER AT HIGH TEMPERATURES : IMPLICATIONS FOR LIFE, AT THE 1991 ANNUAL MEETING OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOC OF AMERICA	OCT   20, 1991OCT   20, 1991	GEOL SOC AMER, ORGANIC GEOCHEM DIV; AMER CHEM SOC, GEOCHEM DIV; UNOCALGEOL SOC AMER, ORGANIC GEOCHEM DIV; AMER CHEM SOC, GEOCHEM DIV; UNOCAL	SAN DIEGO, CASAN DIEGO, CA	25	0	2	0	6	0	26			0016-7037			WOS:A1993LP79400004	11538299

Here, we report a possible way to tune the MIT as well as the magnetic properties of NdNiO3 by reducing the crystalline size to the nanoscale. NdNiO3 nanoparticles of different sizes have been synthesized by a simple aqueous solution-based chemical method in the atmospheric pressure under oxygen. The x-ray diffraction study shows the formation of orthorhombic nanocrystals of NdNiO3 with Pbnm space group, presence of oxygen vacancies and higher octahedral distortion. The morphology and the particle size distribution have been evaluated by FESEM and TEM. The temperature dependent resistivity measurement shows the metal to insulator transition, which depends on the particle size; lower the particle size, higher the MIT temperature (T-MI). Further study on the temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility shows the signature of magnetic phase transition at a temperature (Neel temperature T-N), lower than the T-MI, which indicates the existence of second order magnetic phase transition in our NdNiO3 nanoparticles. We have attributed the higher T-MI and the origin of second order magnetic phase transition predominantly to the higher NiO6 octahedral distortion and the narrowing of bandwidth of the nanocrystalline NdNiO3, which leads to the opening of the charge transfer gap at the temperature higher than the bulk.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000607851200044		
J	Bullock, TL; Breddam, K; Remington, SJ								Peptide aldehyde complexes with wheat serine carboxypeptidase II: Implications for the catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity								JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY				255	5			714	725		10.1006/jmbi.1996.0058				FEB 9 1996	1996	The structures of two ternary complexes of wheat serine carboxypeptidase II (CPD-WII), with a tetrapeptide aldehyde and a reaction product arginine, have been determined by X-ray crystallography at room temperature and -170 degrees. The peptide aldehydes, antipain and chymostatin, form covalent adducts with the active-site serine 146. The CPD-WII antipain arginine model has a standard crystallographic R-factor of 0.162, with good geometry at 2.5 Angstrom resolution for data collected at room temperature, The -170 degrees C model of the chymostatin arginine complex has an R-factor of 0.174, with good geometry using data to 2.1 Angstrom resolution.The structures suggest binding subsites N-terminal to the scissile bond. All four residues of chymostatin are well-localized in the putative S-1 through S-1 sites, while density is apparent only in S-1 and S-2 for antipain. In the S-1 site, Val340 and 341, Phe215 and Leu216 form a hydrophobic binding surface, not a pocket, for the P-1 phenylalanyl side-chain of chymostatin. The P-1 arginyl of antipain also binds at this site, but the positive charge appears to be stabilized by additional solvent molecules. Thus, the hybrid nature of the S-1 site accounts for the ability oi: CPD-WII to accept both hydrophobic and basic residues at pi. Hydrogen bonds to the peptide substrate backbone are few and are made primarily with side-chains on the enzyme. Thus, substrate recognition by CPD-WII appears to have nothing in common with that of the other families of serine proteinases.The hemiacetal linkages to the essential Ser146 are of a single stereoisomer with tetrahedral geometry, with an oxygen atom occupying the ''oxyanion hole'' region of the enzyme. This atom accepts three hydrogen bonds, two from the polypeptide backbone and one from the positively-charged amino group of bound arginine, and must be negatively charged. Thus, the combination of ligands forms an excellent approximation to the oxyanion intermediate formed during peptide hydrolysis.Surprisingly; the (R) stereochemistry at the hemiacetal linkage is opposite to that expected by comparison to previously determined structures of peptide aldehydes complexed with Streptomyces griseus proteinase A. This is shown to be a consequence of the approximate mirror symmetry of the arrangement of catalytic groups in the two families of serine proteases and suggests that the stereochemical course of the two enzymatic reactions differ in handedness.

The column densities of dozens of molecules, ranging from simple diatomic to complex organic molecules, are reproduced to within an order of magnitude using a one-dimensional model for the physical and chemical structure of these regions. The chemical ages of the regions are approximately 105 years in both cases. The main desorption mechanisms that are usually included in chemical models (photodesorption, thermal desorption, and cosmic-ray-induced desorption) do not provide sufficient gasphase abundances of molecules that are synthesized in surface reactions; however, this shortcoming can be removed by introducing small amount of reactive desorption into the model. It is possible to reproduce the properties of the TMC-1 chemical composition in a standard model, without requiring additional assumptions about an anomalous C/O ratio or the recent accretion of matter enriched with atomic carbon, as has been proposed by some researchers.									7	1	0	0	1	0	7			1063-7729	1562-6881		WOS:000326630500003

Aberration-corrected JEOL 2200FS (JEOL USA, Peabody, MA) and Vacuum Generators HB-603U STEM instruments were used to image fresh, reduced, leached, used and re-oxidized catalyst samples. A new in situ heating technology (Protochips Inc., Raleigh, NC, USA), which permits full sub-angstrom ngstrom imaging resolution in the JEOL 2200FS was used to study the effects of temperature on the behavior of gold species. A remarkable stability of gold to redox treatments up to 400 degrees C, with atomic gold decorating step surfaces of iron oxide was identified. On heating the samples in vacuum to 700 degrees C, it was found that monodispersed gold began to sinter to form nanoparticles above 500 degrees C. Gold species internal to the iron oxide support material was shown to diffuse to the surface at elevated temperature, coalescing into discrete nanocrystals. The results demonstrate the value of in situ heating for understanding morphological changes in the catalyst with elevated temperature treatments.									62	7	0	0	10	0	63			0022-0744	1477-9986		WOS:000266351700015	19339311	
J	LICHTNER, PC; BIINO, GG								A 1ST PRINCIPLES APPROACH TO SUPERGENE ENRICHMENT OF A PORPHYRY COPPER PROTORE .1. CU-FE-S SUBSYSTEM								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				56	11			3987	4013		10.1016/0016-7037(92)90012-8				NOV 1992	1992	A unified description of supergene enrichment of a porphyry copper protore is presented based on the principles of metasomatic zoning. Mathematically this formulation represents the supergene weathering process as a moving boundary problem, A first principles approach is used to describe quantitatively the transport of oxygenated water through a porous host rock consisting of a Cu-bearing protore. Mineral reaction rates are represented by kinetic rate expressions for both precipitation and dissolution. Reaction zones containing mineral alteration products making up a leached zone, oxide zone, and enrichment blanket propagate downward in the direction of fluid transport. The time evolution of the system is completely determined by the governing transport equations once initial and boundary conditions are specified, giving the composition of the unaltered host rock and infiltrating fluid entering at the surface of the weathering column. The description provides for both fully saturated conditions and undersaturated conditions in the presence of a water table at depth. An order of magnitude estimate of the velocity of propagation of a redox front demonstrates that metasomatic effects become increasingly important as the O content of the infiltrating water increases. Regions of higher permeability, resulting in higher fluid flow velocities, lead to increased enrichment compared to regions of lower permeability, with reduced flow velocities, in agreement with field observations. Results of numerical calculations suggest that the enrichment blanket may be subdivided into three distinct zones: (1) an enriched zone at the top of the blanket; (2) the middle blanket in which chemical reactions of Cu-bearing minerals are absent; and (3) the nascent blanket forming the interface between the protore and middle blanket. Both the nascent and middle blanket contain the same Cu grade as the protore. These results are in agreement with field observations of a high Cu grade within a relatively narrow zone in the upper portion of the blanket. Results of numerical calculations for three different scenarios are presented. The first example considers a simplified representation of the enrichment process with chalcopyrite, covellite, and chalcocite as the major Cu minerals. In this case chalcocite forms an enriched zone at the top of the blanket which migrates downward increasing in width. The second and third examples differ by the presence of a water table at depth, and include brochantite, tenorite, native Cu, and cuprite as secondary Cu minerals in addition to the minerals used in the first example. Surprisingly, in these two examples the enriched blanket zone does not grow indefinitely with time, but reaches a steady-state profile that is displaced rigidly in the direction of fluid transport without changing shape. In the presence of a water table at depth, the major enrichment occurs in the oxide zone lying above the blanket.									37	0	0	0	1	0	37			0016-7037			WOS:A1992JW84600011

Passivation of carbon steel was facilitated by flow of the less acidic rapeseed and waste cooking oils and increased flux of oxygen. Carbon steel was sensitive for the higher concentration of proton donor species, acidity of the waste lard. Higher mass loss rates correlated with increased corrosion currents measured in citric acid solution by electrochemical methods. Flow of the biomasses and increased acid concentration of the emulsions were beneficial for the passivation of stainless steels. Although corrosion related mass loss, dissolution rate of the passive layers increased by flow and high acidity of the fluids, both the formation and compactness of passive layers are facilitated by the biomasses with higher concentration of oxygen donating species like water, alcohol and acids. Surface transformation of the passivating steels was reflected by decreasing electrochemical pseudo-capacity of the interfaces and increasing resistance of the passive layers derived from the results of Tafel and Stern methods as well as impedance results. Anti-correlation between mass loss results obtained by immersion in the biomasses and electrochemical data measured in dilute aqueous citric acid solution is explained by the varied compactness, resistance of the passive layers and exchange currents of the steel electrodes due to the orders of magnitude different activities of the hydrogen ion in the biomass mixtures and citric acid solution.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2070-2051	2070-206X		WOS:000439954100024		
J	Wang, Jin; Wang, Yi; Zhang, Dun; Ren, Wenyu; Yang, Zhanxu								Discovering the direct evidence of photocatalytic sterilization mechanism on bimetallic sulfides heterostructures								JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE				623				182	195		10.1016/j.jcis.2022.05.019				OCT 2022	2022	Despite the development of sterilization, the study of reactive oxygen species (ROS) based disinfection mechanism is still under restrictions due to the lack of direct evidence. In this work, DiI is used to explore the sterilization mechanism in-depth. The mechanism is directly proven to be that the generated ROS would seriously damage the lipid of the cell membrane. It provides direct evidence for the destruction of cell membrane for the first time. These ROS can cause the death of more than 99% of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria within 120 min under visible light. What's more, MoS2/MSy (MSy = MnS, CuS, and CeS2) are successfully synthesized by employing Mo/M-MOF (M = Mn, Cu, and Ce) as precursors. Since bigger Fermi lever difference and smaller work function bring better photocatalytic activity, MoS2/MnS composites display superb photocatalytic activity than others. Therefore, the as-prepared materials can be widely used in environmental protection, biotechnology, and clinical therapy. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Among the non-precious HOR catalysts, NiMo catalysts with various compositions are studied. The composition of Mo is explored up to 45 % through the fast and facile electrodeposition technique. The prepared NixMo100-x catalysts have similar particle sizes and shapes, as well as amorphous structures owing to the adsorption of the citrate and Mo addition. Among the NixMo100-x catalysts, Ni62Mo38 shows the highest HOR activity of 0.94 and 1.31 mA/cm(2) at 0.05 and 0.10 VRHE, respectively, in 0.1 M KOH solution. Additionally, the catalyst shows improved performance after the stability test (a maximum of 2.39 mA/cm(2) after 100 cycles and 2.02 mA/cm(2) after 3000 cycles at 0.10 V-RHE, which are 111 % and 93.5 % of the initial performance of Pt/C, respectively), compared to its initial activity. This is superior to those of previously reported non-precious HOR catalysts, indicating its applicability to the AEMFC. This improved performance is attributed to the structural properties (amorphous and large electrochemical surface area), modified electronic structure of Ni by alloying with Mo, and strengthened bifunctional effect by repeated potential cycling.

The ETL is embedded as a junction between a photocatalyst (NiCo2S4/CdO) and an electron collector (carbon cloth (CC)). The electron density gradient, band gap offset, and p-orbital states above the fermi level in the ETL regulate the directional flow of electrons from NiCo2S4/CdO to CC. The distinct locations of electrons and holes were confirmed based on the oxidation state and preferential deposition of platinum and lead ions on NiCo2S4/CdO@CC. The molecular orbitals and density of states and their relation to ETL's performance were explained using first principles calculations. Reduction in recombination energy loss was supported by the Nyquist and Bode phase analyses. ETL's inclusion resulted in a remarkable 77 % increase in H-2 yield, suggesting that they have excellent potential for practical applications.									16	2	0	0	3	0	16			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000514218900007

Seven predominant aerobic denitrifiers were isolated and characterized from the oligotrophic ecosystems. Based on their phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, the isolates were identified as the genera of Pseudomonas, Achromobacter and Acinetobacter, and all isolates could express periplasmic nitrate reductase which was essential for the aerobic denitrification. The growth rates of the isolates were at 0.30-0.83 h(-1), and obvious denitrification occurred when the dissolved oxygen (DO) level maintained at 3-10 mg L-1. The isolates were able to conduct heterotrophic nitrification for realizing completely nitrogen removal in aerobic oligotrophic niche. Furthermore, three strains especially Pseudomonas sp.3-7 showed outstanding capacities of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) secretion and aggregation. Results demonstrated that the isolation of aerobic denitrifiers favored the bioremediation of oligotrophic ecosystems. Crown Copyright (c) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this review, we summarize the latest research developments in 1D and 2D noble metal-based nanocrystals with various nanostructures, and their potential applications as electrocatalysts toward fuel-cell-related electrocatalysis. Five strategies including size, shape, composition, surface, and interface engineering are proposed to rationally design the nanoarchitectures of the 1D and 2D noble metal-based electrocatalysts. In addition, we also highlight the underlying mechanisms behind the structure-property relationship. Finally, we conclude the current challenges and give our perspectives on the development of high-performance 1D and 2D noble metal-based electrocatalysts.

Here we demonstrate the application of an innovative reference electrode to the study of catalyst degradation in an operating PEMWE. This approach enables separation of the relative contribution of anode and cathode to the overall water splitting reaction. It is shown that, in shut-down periods during power cycling, the cathode contributes more to changes in open circuit voltage than the anode. Changes in the electrochemical surface area of the platinum cathode as a result of power cycling are measured in situ for the first time using hydrogen underpotential cyclic voltammetry. The results demonstrate that degradation of the platinum cathode plays a more significant role than conventionally assumed by the electrolyser community, which has tended to focus more on the iridium/ruthenium oxide anode because it dominates the performance of the cell.

Recently, rechargeable batteries with high energy density, power density, stability, and rate performance, as well as low cost have attracted the attention of researchers globally. However, achieving all these merits in a single rechargeable battery system is difficult. Accordingly, many approaches are reported to improve the performance of different energy storage devices. Nevertheless, reports on a general research method to improve the performance of battery systems are still limited. Herein, the current progress of rechargeable batteries and the corresponding opportunities and challenges are summarized. The principles of electrochemical reactions for lead-acid batteries, metal-ion batteries, metal-sulfur batteries, and metal-air batteries are introduced and compared. The technological challenges in the development of rechargeable batteries on the basis of transports of electrons and ions are comprehensively analyzed. In particular, approaches for regulating electronic and ionic transports are comprehensively discussed for the enhancement of electrochemical performance. Some advanced energy storage materials with good electronic and ionic conductivities are also highlighted. Furthermore, several perspectives on potential research directions for the choice and design of high-performance rechargeable batteries for practical application are proposed.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2365-709X			WOS:000724915700001

Iridium complexes have been successfully exploited as water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) with remarkable performances. Herein, we report a systematic study aimed at benchmarking well-known Ir WOCs, when NaIO4 is used to drive the reaction. In particular, the following complexes were studied: cis-[Ir(ppy)(2) (H2O)(2) ]OTf (ppy=2-phenylpyridine) (1), [Cp*Ir(H2O)3 ]NO3 (Cp*=1,2,3,4,5-pentamethyl-cyclopentadienyl anion) (2), [Cp*Ir(bzpy)Cl] (bzpy=2-benzoylpyridine) (3), [Cp*IrCl2 (Me-2-NHC)] (NHC=N-heterocyclic carbene) (4), [Cp*Ir(pyalk)Cl] (pyalk=2-pyridine-isopropanoate) (5), [Cp*Ir(pic)NO3 ] (pic=2-pyridine-carboxylate) (6), [Cp*Ir{(P(O)(OH)(2) }3 ]Na (7), and mer-[IrCl3 (pic)(HOMe)]K (8). Their reactivity was compared with that of IrCl3 center dot nH(2)O (9) and [Ir(OH)(6)](2-) (10). Most measurements were performed in phosphate buffer (0.2M), in which 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10 showed very high activity (yield close to 100%, turnover frequency up to 554 min(-1) with 10, the highest ever observed for a WO-driven by NaIO4 ). The found order of activity is: 10>2 approximate to 4>6>5>7>1>9>3>8. Clues concerning the molecular nature of the active species were obtained, whereas its exact nature remains doubtfully.									25	1	0	0	0	0	25			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000416158500026	28994240

Copper incorporation is increased six-fold by hydrothermal ion exchange relative to conventional methods. In all cases, the amount of copper taken up by SAPO-11 is superior to uptake in SAPO-5. Copper is divalent and in tetragonally-distorted octahedral environments in the as-prepared samples independent of the method of incorporation for both systems. The local structures about the metal and the valence states associated with the different steps in the selective catalytic reduction of NOx in the presence of propene (SCR-HC) have been investigated using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). For both the Cu:SAPO-5 and Cu:SAPO-11 systems, heating in helium partially autoreduces copper(II) to copper(I). Following activation in oxygen, propene causes further reduction to copper(I) in all four samples as shown by the evolution of an intense pre-edge diagnostic feature. XANES analysis reveal this to be characteristic of monomeric linear two coordinate copper(I) species. This is a prime example of a pre-edge peak with such a high intensity being observed in the solid state. This is supported by IR where peaks attributed to bidentate copper were observed for Cu:SAPO-11/HT. For all four samples NOx partially reoxidises the copper(I) formed in the helium and propene steps. Ion exchanged Cu:SAPO-5 and Cu:SAPO-11 exhibit low activity in reducing NOx by propene in an oxygen rich environment. The role of the copper ion during NO adsorption was studied using in situ infra red spectroscopy. The activity of copper exchanged materials is governed by both the degree of reducibility of copper(II) and the ease of reversing the valence states with the structural characteristics of the parent materials playing a crucial role.									31	4	0	0	3	0	33			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000267300000031	19551218

Dark minus light spectra gave rise to a broad S-1-state signal with a g value of about 4.9 [Dexheimer, S, L., Klein, M. P. (1992) J, Am. Chem. Sec. 114, 2821-2826]. Temperature variation of the signal intensity between 1.9 and 10 K observed in PS II with a sucrose buffer indicates that the signal originates from an excited state with a spin S of 1 with separation from the ground state (S = 0) of about 2.5 K. The S-1-state signal was also observed in the sucrose buffer supplemented by 50% glycerol, However, no S-1-state signal was detected by addition of 3% methanol or 30% ethylene glycol in the sucrose buffer, although illumination at 200 K in the presence of these alcohols induced the normal multiline St signal. Furthermore, modification of the Mn cluster by Cl- or Ca2+ depletion from PS II membranes failed to produce a detectable S-1-state signal. A possible magnetic structure of the Mn cluster responsible for the generation of the S-1-state signal is discussed on the basis of these observations.									105	1	0	0	57	0	107			0006-2960			WOS:A1997XE96700027	9200702

Cells were rapidly transferred into ice-cold organic solvent for instantaneous extraction of the cellular PQ plus PQH(2) content. After high-performance liquid chromatography fractionation of the organic phase extract, the PQH(2) content was quantitatively determined via its fluorescence emission at 330 nm. The in-cell PQH(2)-PQ ratio then followed from comparison of the PQH(2) signal in samples as collected and in an identical sample after complete reduction with sodium borohydride. Prior to PQH(2) extraction, cells from steady-state chemostat cultures were exposed to a wide range of physiological conditions, including high/low availability of inorganic carbon, and various actinic illumination conditions. Well-characterized electron-transfer inhibitors were used to generate a reduced or an oxidized PQ pool for reference. The in vivo redox state of the PQ pool was correlated with the results of pulse-amplitude modulation-based chlorophyll a fluorescence emission measurements, oxygen exchange rates, and 77 K fluorescence emission spectra. Our results show that the redox state of the PQ pool of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 is subject to strict homeostatic control (i.e. regulated between narrow limits), in contrast to the more dynamic chlorophyll a fluorescence signal.									27	0	0	0	25	0	28			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000335906300036	24696521

Due to time-scales in the problem, the model considers a quasi steady gas phase with a transient solid. The gas is described by axially varying bulk temperature and species. The gas includes lateral diffusion via transfer coefficients and the specification of a gas phase species concentration at the wall; axial diffusion is neglected. The solid phase is a thermally thin shell with axially varying temperature, surface species, and surface species concentrations. The solid includes axial heat conduction and external heat loss by convection and radiation. The combustion process utilizes detailed gas and surface reaction models. The gas-phase model becomes a system of stiff ordinary differential equations with respect to axial position; the upstream (inlet) boundary conditions are specified and the axially varying solid properties are parameters in integration. The solid phase discretizes into a system of stiff ordinary differential-algebraic equations with respect to time. The time evolution of the system comes from alternating integrations of the quasi-steady gas phase and transient solid.The model is compared to two experimental cases using CO fuel: (1) steady-state conversion in an isothermal platinum tube and (2) transient propagation of a catalytic reaction inside a small platinum tube and includes external tube temperature measurements. This work presents sensitivity studies on important parameters including internal transfer coefficients, catalytic surface site density, external heat-loss, and others. Under mass-transfer limited conditions, global transfer coefficients are adequate to predict fuel conversion. Near light-off, the model predictions improve for the first case after adjusting the surface kinetics such that the net rate of CO adsorption increases compared to O-2. For the second case, predictions of transient propagation speeds are good for equivalence ratios near unity and greater but require adjustment of external heat loss or kinetics to match under lean conditions.

This could be overcome by addition of an oxidizing agent. In this study, the oxidative absorption of reduced sulfur compounds-hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methanethiol (CH3SH) and dimethyl sulfide (CH3S2CH3)-in a high-porosity trickling filter with added iron chelated by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was examined. The process was observed online by proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS).RESULTSRemoval efficiencies of H2S remained in the range 80-99% for all combinations of operating parameters tested. The removal efficiency of CH3SH was found to be limited compared to this, with removal efficiencies ranging from 10% to 74% and a strong dependence on gas flow rate and residence time was observed; CH3S2CH3 was found to be inactive. The FeEDTA solutions were prepared from ferrous chloride (FeCl2) as solutions of this compound were more stable than solutions prepared from ferric salts. Oxygen present in the gas stream allowed oxidation of Fe(2+)EDTA to Fe(3+)EDTA in situ, making regeneration prior to experimental runs unnecessary. To maintain high removal efficiencies during start-up, pH should be kept above 7.CONCLUSIONChelated iron catalysts could be effectively applied for H2S removal in a one-step trickling filter process treating low-concentration (<3.5ppm) and diluted waste gas streams, which are characteristic for environmental waste treatment facilities and livestock houses. However, removal of other reduced sulfur compounds important for deodorization was found to be limited.

To evaluate the oxidative stress state, the levels of total glutathione (tGSH), reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and subsequently the oxidative stress index (OSI), were determined in the same tissue samples. The transcript level of GSH-Px was significantly upregulated in fish exposed to hyperoxia, and significantly downregulated in fish exposed to hypoxia, compared to the normoxia group. Significant downregulation was also found for SOD and CYP1A transcriptional levels in fish exposed to hypoxia. The transcript levels of catalase and MT did not change in liver of cod exposed to suboptimal oxygen levels. No significant differences were seen between the groups for tGSH, GSH, GSSG or OSI. Prolonged exposure to unfavourable oxygen saturation levels did not alter the OSI, indicating that the antioxidant glutathione system is maintained at an unchanged level in liver of the examined cod.									61	2	1	0	58	0	64			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000239641100018	16857873

In-situ phosphorus diffusion from the substrate was confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiles. The generation of cobalt oxyhydroxide was also verified during electrochemical treatment, achieving surface self-reconstruction. The obtained materials revealed efficient and stable electrocatalytic performance, with HER and OER overpotentials of 117 mV and 272 mV, respectively. A low cell voltage of 1.59 V was achieved for overall water splitting with long-term stability. These properties were ascribed to the 2D/3D nanostructure with abundant interface defects. In-situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to further understand the electrocatalytic activity and the promoted mechanism of reconstruction-derived CoOOH on OER performance.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000772952100004		
J	Li, Mei; Zhang, Shengbo; Zhao, Jiankang; Wang, Hua					Wang, Hua/0000-0002-8305-3655			Maximizing Metal-Support Interactions in Pt/Co3O4 Nanocages to Simultaneously Boost Hydrogen Production Activity and Durability								ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES				13	48			57362	57371		10.1021/acsami.1c18403				DEC 8 2021	2021	Catalytic hydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB) provides an effective way to generate pure H-2 at ambient temperature for fuel cells. Pt-based catalysts usually exhibit great initial activity toward this reaction but deactivate quickly. Here, we report that the metal-support interactions in Pt/Co3O4 nanocages can simultaneously accelerate the H-2 generation and enhance the catalyst's stability. The Pt/Co3O4 catalyst is made for the first time by embedding Pt clusters (similar to 1.2 nm) in a high-surface-area Co3O4 nanocage to maximize the metal-support interface. The turnover frequency of the Pt/Co3O4 catalyst is about nine times higher than that of commercial Pt/C and outperforms almost all other Pt-based catalysts. X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in situ spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations suggest that the Co3O4 nanocages with rich oxygen vacancies facilitate the adsorption and dissociation of H2O to give electropositive H (H delta+), while the in situ embedded Pt clusters can accelerate the formation of electronegative H (H delta-) from AB. Subsequently, the H delta+ and H delta- spill over to the abundant interfacial sites and bond into H-2. In addition to this dual-function synergy effect, the strong metal-support electronic interactions between Co3O4 and Pt benefit the desorption of poisonous B-containing byproducts from Pt sites. This effect together with cluster anchoring leads to a fivefold enhancement in durability compared to commercial Pt/C. The metal-support interactions revealed in this study provide more options for catalyst design toward facile H-2 production from chemical hydrogen storage materials.									8	0	0	0	0	0	7			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000752970600055	34817150	
J	Zhang, Weiwei; Li, Ying; Wang, Peng								Long non-coding RNA-ROR aggravates myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury								BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH				51	6					e6555	10.1590/1414-431X20186555				2018	2018	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, especially in myocardial infarction and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we determined the role and the possible underlying molecular mechanism of lncRNA-ROR in myocardial I/R injury. H9c2 cells and human cardiomyocytes (HCM) were subjected to either hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R), I/R or normal conditions (normoxia). The expression levels of lncRNA-ROR were detected in serum of myocardial I/R injury patients, H9c2 cells, and HCM by qRT-PCR. Then, levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) were measured by kits. Cell viability, apoptosis, apoptosis-associated factors, and p38/MAPK pathway were examined by MTT, flow cytometry, and western blot assays. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was determined by H2DCF-DA and MitoSOX Red probes with flow cytometry. NADPH oxidase activity and NOX2 protein levels were measured by lucigenin chemiluminescence and western blot. Results showed that lncRNA-ROR expression was increased in I/R patients and in H/R treatment of H9c2 cells and HCM. Moreover, lncRNA-ROR significantly promoted H/R-induced myocardial injury via stimulating release of LDH, MDA, SOD, and GSH-PX. Furthermore, lncRNA-ROR decreased cell viability, increased apoptosis, and regulated expression of apoptosis-associated factors. Additionally, lncRNA-ROR increased phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 expression and inhibition of p38/MAPK, and rescued lncRNA-ROR-induced cell injury in H9c2 cells and HCM. ROS production, NADPH oxidase activity, and NOX2 protein levels were promoted by lncRNA-ROR. These data suggested that lncRNA-ROR acted as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of myocardial I/R injury.									58	2	0	0	45	1	59			0100-879X	1414-431X		WOS:000430655300001	29694511

Deletion of conserved residues in the N-terminal region has been used to investigate the importance of this hydrophilic extension. Using Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, three deletion strains: Delta(N6-N8), Delta(P11-V12) and Delta(E13-N15), have been created. The Delta(N6-N8) and gm Delta(P11-V12) strains remained photoautotrophic but were more susceptible to photodamage than the wild type; however, the Delta(E13-N15) cells had the most severe phenotype. The Delta(E13-N15) mutant showed decreased photoautotrophic growth, a reduced number of PS II centers, impaired oxygen evolution in the presence of PS II-specific electron acceptors, and was highly susceptible to photodamage. The decay kinetics of chlorophyll a variable fluorescence after a single turnover saturating flash and the sensitivity to low concentrations of PS H-directed herbicides in the Delta(E13-N15) strain indicate that the binding of plastoquinone to the Q(B)-binding site had been altered such that the affinity of Q(B) is reduced. In addition, the PS II-specific electron acceptor 2,5-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone was found to inhibit electron transfer through the quinone-acceptor complex of the Delta(E13-N15) strain. The PsbL Y20A mutant was also investigated and it exhibited increased susceptibility to photodamage and increased herbicide sensitivity. Our data suggest that the N-terminal hydrophilic region of PsbL influences forward electron transfer from Q(A) through indirect interactions with the D-E loop of the D1 reaction center protein. Our results further indicate that disruption of interactions between the N-terminal region of PsbL and other PS II subunits or lipids destabilizes PS II dimer formation.

J	Fan, Meihua; Sun, Xue; Liao, Zhi; Wang, Jianxin; Cui, Dalian; Xu, Nianjun								Full-length cDNA cloning, characterization of catalase from Ulva prolifera and antioxidant response to diphenyliodonium								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY				30	6			3361	3372		10.1007/s10811-018-1567-2				DEC 2018	2018	Here, we present a method for the acquisition of the catalase gene, among the most important enzymes involved in the elimination of reactive oxygen species, from Ulva prolifera, and investigate the relationship of NADPH oxidase, salicylic acid, and high-temperature stress on U. prolifera. The full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) of the catalase gene from the green alga U. prolifera (UpCAT) was cloned by polymerase chain reaction using rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, NADPH oxidase, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and the expression level of UpCAT and glutathione reductase (GR) were investigated following treatment with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyliodonium and salicylic acid at high temperature. The UpCAT cDNA sequence consisted of 1919 bp containing a 5'-untranslated region of 133 bp, a 3'-untranslated region of 307 bp with a polyA tail, and an open reading frame of 1479 bp encoding a polypeptide of 492 amino acids with molecular weight of 56.88 kDa and theoretical pI of 6.658. The deduced amino acid sequence of UpCAT had significant homology to catalases from other plants. The UpCAT protein sequence contained a proximal heme-ligand signature of (34)4RIFSYPDTQ(352) and a proximal active-site signature of (54)FDRERIPERVVHARGAAA(71). Additionally, three key residues correlating to catalytic activity, His(65), Asn(139), and Tyr(348), were in the UpCAT sequence. Phylogenetic-tree analysis showed that U. prolifera grouped with Ulva fasciata, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Haematococcus pluvialis, and Volvox carteri. Furthermore, we observed that under the high-temperature treatment condition, diphenyliodonium treatment (0.01-0.5 mg L-1) reduced NADPH oxidase activity over the entire time, reduced superoxide dismutase, catalase, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity at the early time and induced the expression of UpCAT. Additionally, the expression level of glutathione reductase was suppressed after DPI (0.5 mg L-1) treatment. Analysis of the UpCAT gene substantially advanced our understanding of green-lineage evolution. The results indicated that NADPH oxidase is involved in the process of salicylic acid-induced alleviation of high-temperature stress; however, the specific mechanism requires further study.					8th Asian Pacific Phycological Forum (APPF) on Algae - New Perspectives Towards a Progressive and Sustainable Living8th Asian Pacific Phycological Forum (APPF) on Algae - New Perspectives Towards a Progressive and Sustainable Living	OCT 08-13, 2017OCT 08-13, 2017	Univ Malaya, Inst Ocean & Earth Sci; Asian Pacific Phycol AssocUniv Malaya, Inst Ocean & Earth Sci; Asian Pacific Phycol Assoc	Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIAKuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0921-8971	1573-5176		WOS:000455405900037

O, H, C, and S isotope compositions of carbonate, silicate, and sulfide minerals, and from graphite and inclusion fluids from this deposit have been measured in order to infer the composition of ore-forming fluids. The data show small variation at the deposit scale, irrespective of host rock. Calculated delta(18)O values of H2O in the fluid in equilibrium with quartz, hydrous silicates and carbonates are, respectively, +6.2 to +12.4 parts per thousand, +5.0 to +9.0 parts per thousand, and +5.9 to + 11.0 parts per thousand (SMOW). The delta D-H2O of inclusion fluids is -20 parts per thousand, whereas values for chlorite and white mica are -16 parts per thousand and -20 to -28 parts per thousand (SMOW), respectively. These values are compatible with a metamorphic origin, which is in agreement with the post-metamorphic timing of the mineralization. The calculated delta(13)C value Of CO2 of the fluid in equilibrium with the carbonates is from -9.5 parts per thousand to -12.7 parts per thousand (PDB), whereas the graphite-bearing host rocks have delta(13)C value of graphite carbon of -29.7 parts per thousand. The calculated delta(34)S of H2S of the fluid varies mainly between +0.7%o and +5.5 parts per thousand (CDT), and is interpreted as reflecting a magmatic or average crustal source for sulfur. The restricted isotopic compositions indicate a relatively homogeneous fluid and deposition under restricted temperature conditions. Nonetheless, a relatively wide temperature range of 272-383 degrees C is estimated for the ore-bearing fluid using the quartz-dolomite oxygen isotope thermometer. Collectively, the data indicate that gold was transported as a reduced sulfur complex, by a metamorphic fluid having a near neutral pH, at relatively low f O-2. Furthermore, the data suggest that gold was deposited during the structural evolution of the associated shear zone probably as a result of sulfidation and carbonatization reactions with the Fe- and C-rich host rocks, which resulted in changes of the pH and in the redox state of the ore fluid.

J	Ren, Tao; Zhong, Hong; Zhang, Xing-chun								Fluid inclusion and stable isotope (C, O and S) constraints on the genesis of the high-grade Langdu Cu skarn deposit in Yunnan, SW China								ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS				118						103354	10.1016/j.oregeorev.2020.103354				MAR 2020	2020	The Langdu Cu skarn deposit is the highest grade Cu deposit (average 6.49% Cu) in the Zhongdian polymetallic district in SW China. Skarns and ore bodies occur primarily in the contact zone of Upper Triassic Qugasi Formation (Fm.) and Late Triassic (ca. 217 Ma) intrusions. Disseminated, massive, stockwork, and vein-like sulfide ores occur in the skarn, quartz-calcite veins, porphyry and marble. Skarn minerals include pyroxene, garnet, actinolite, and epidote. Four types (six subtypes) of fluid inclusions (FIs) are identified in the sulfide-bearing quartz veins. Type-I liquid-rich two phase FIs have varying vapor/liquid ratios, and yielded homogenization temperatures of 110-338 degrees C and salinities of 1.729.5 wt% NaCl eqv. Type-II vapor-rich FIs contain CH4-N-2 bubbles and homogenized to vapor at 262-425 degrees C. Type-III FIs are single phase at room temperature (20 degrees C). A vapor phase is present at below -120 degrees C, and the FIs homogenized at -117 to -114 degrees C. Type-IV daughter mineral-bearing FIs homogenized by halite disappearance at 295392 degrees C, and have salinities of 37.846.6 wt% NaCl eqv. Such characteristics suggest that FIs were trapped by fluid immiscibility and phase separation. The delta(34)(SCDT) values of chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite are of -5.3 to 0.7 parts per thousand. On the delta S-34 histogram, all Langdu data show a cluster of S-32-rich (delta(34)(SCDT) = -5.3 to -4.6 parts per thousand) and a cluster of S-34-rich (delta(34)(SCDT) = -1.1 to 0.7 parts per thousand). Type-I calcite (in skarn) and type-II calcite (in quartz-sulfide vein) have delta(13)(CPDB) and delta(18)(OSMOW) values of -8.4 to -7.8 parts per thousand, -6.3 to -6.1 parts per thousand and 10.1 to 12.3 parts per thousand and 12.0 to 13.0 parts per thousand, respectively. Type-III calcite from calcite-sulfide veins has delta(13)(CPDB) = -5.6 to 0.2 parts per thousand and delta(18)(OSMOW) = 12.5 to 16.3 parts per thousand. Biotite, garnet and pyroxene, syn-ore quartz, and chlorite yielded delta(18)(OSMOW) values of 6.9 parts per thousand, 4.15 parts per thousand, 13.215.3 parts per thousand, and 6.8 parts per thousand, respectively. Sulfur, carbon and oxygen isotopic features of these hydrothermal minerals and the FIs microthermometric data suggest that the ore-forming fluids were magmatic sourced and contaminated by meteoric/formation water during ascent and/or fluid/wallrock interactions. Low d34S (=-5.3 to -4.6 parts per thousand) in sulfides and the CH4 in the FIs are interpreted to reflect the reaction between the magmatic fluids and the carbonaceous slate in Qugasi Fm. The methane likely expanded the vapor/liquid immiscibility field and reduced the sulfates (SO42-) to sulfides (S2-). And extensive water/rock reaction and fluid mixing may have occurred, leading to the high-grade Cu mineralization at Langdu.									2	1	0	0	0	0	3			0169-1368	1872-7360		WOS:000518709000031

RNase P activities are either ribonucleoprotein (RNP) or protein only RNase P (PRORP) enzymes, raising the question about the mechanistic strategies utilized by these architecturally different enzyme classes to catalyze the same type of reaction. Here, we analyzed the kinetics and cleavage-site selection by PRORP3 from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtPRORP3) using precursor tRNAs (pre-tRNAs) with individual modifications at the canonical cleavage site, with either Rp- or Sp-phosphorothioate, or 2'-deoxy, 2'-fluoro, 2'-amino, or 2'-O-methyl substitutions. We observed a small but robust rescue effect of Sp-phosphorothioate-modified pre-tRNA in the presence of thiophilic Cd2+ ions, consistent with metal-ion coordination to the (pro-)Sp-oxygen during catalysis. Sp-phosphorothioate, 2'-deoxy, 2'-amino, and 2'-O-methyl modification redirected the cleavage mainly to the next unmodified phosphodiester in the 5'-direction. Our findings are in line with the 2'-OH substituent at nucleotide - 1 being involved in an H-bonding acceptor function. In contrast to bacterial RNase P, AtPRORP3 was found to be able to utilize the canonical and upstream cleavage site with similar efficiency (corresponding to reduced cleavage fidelity), and the two cleavage pathways appear less interdependent than in the bacterial RNA-based system.

The detailed nucleosynthetic yields of our explosion models are calculated by post-processing the ejecta, using passively advected tracer particles. The nuclear reaction network employed in computing the explosive nucleosynthesis contains 383 nuclear species, ranging from neutrons, protons, and alpha-particles to Mo-98. Our models follow the common assumption that SN la are the explosions of white dwarf's that have approached the Chandrasekhar mass (M-ch similar to 1.39), and are disrupted by thermonuclear fusion of carbon and oxygen. But in contrast to 1D models which adjust the burning speed to reproduce lightcurves and spectra, the thermonuclear burning model applied in this paper does not contain adjustable parameters. Therefore variations of the explosion energies and nucleosynthesis yields are dependent on changes of the initial conditions only. Here we discuss the nucleosynthetic yields obtained in 2D and 3D models with two different choices of ignition conditions (centrally ignited, in which the spherical initial flame geometry is perturbated with toroidal rings, and bubbles, in which multi-point ignition conditions are simulated), but keeping the initial composition of the white dwarf unchanged. Constraints imposed on the hydrodynamical models from nucleosynthesis as well as from the radial velocity distribution of the elements are discussed in detail. We show that in our simulations unburned C and O varies typically from similar to40% to similar to50% of the total ejected material. Some of the unburned material remains between the flame plumes and is concentrated in low velocity regions at the end of the simulations. This effect is more pronounced in 2D than in 3D and in models with a small number of (large) ignition spots. The main differences between all our models and standard 1D computations are, besides the higher mass fraction of unburned C and O, the C/O ratio (in our case is typically a factor of 2.5 higher than in 1D computations), and somewhat lower abundances of certain intermediate mass nuclei such as S, Cl, Ar, K, and Ca, and of Ni-56. We also demonstrate that the amount of Ni-56 produced in the explosion is a very sensitive function of density and temperature. Because explosive C and O burning may produce the iron-group elements and their isotopes in rather different proportions one can get different Ni-56-fractions (and thus supernova luminosities) without changing the kinetic energy of the explosion. Finally, we show that we need the high resolution multi-point ignition (bubbles) model to burn most of the material in the center (demonstrating that high resolution coupled with a large number of ignition spots is crucial to get rid of unburned material in a pure deflagration SN la model).									194	4	2	0	1	0	196			1432-0746			WOS:000224623400025

Here, we have investigated the structural, electronic, optical, charge transfer and photocatalytic mechanism of red phosphorus RP/CH3NH3PbI3 heterostructure under hydrostatic pressure by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) prove RP/CH3NH3PbI3 is thermodynamically stable. Interestingly, direct band gap of RP/CH3NH3PbI3 decreases linearly with increase of pressure. The band gap is 1.43 eV at 1.5 GPa, which can enhance the absorption of visible light and generate redshift in absorption edge. Interface charge redistribution makes valence/conduction band edge positions of RP monolayer and CH3NH3PbI3 (010) surface vary with Fermi level, forming an internal electric field have ability to separate electron-hole pairs. Typical Z-scheme heterostructure is formed and supposed to have resulted strong redox ability. The theoretical results hope to provide a possibility for the future experimental preparation of CH3NH3PbI3- based photocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0360-3199	1879-3487		WOS:000752440100011		
J	Schidlowski, M								Carbon isotopes as biogeochemical recorders of life over 3.8 Ga of Earth history: evolution of a concept								PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH				106	1-2			117	134		10.1016/S0301-9268(00)00128-5				FEB 1 2001	2001	Ever since pioneering studies in the late 1930s had shown that the conversion of inorganic carbon into biogenic substances entails sizeable redistributions of the stable carbon isotopes, biologically mediated C-13/C-12 fractionations have come to be recognized as a common corollary of biochemical reactions. Meanwhile, it is firmly established that the universal bias in favour of C-12 characterizing biological materials primarily derives from a kinetic isotope effect that is imposed on the first carbon-fixing enzymatic carboxylation reaction in the primary metabolism of CO2-fixing (autotrophic) organisms. This preference for C-12 has turned out to be one of the most enduring relies of the 'ordered state' of the biological precursor substances that may be preserved in fossil organics over billions of years. With the currently known sedimentary record at hand, it can be stated with confidence that biological carbon isotope fractionations have persisted throughout 3.8 Ga of recorded Earth history, indicating that microbial (prokaryotic and archaeoprokaryotic) ecosystems had been prolific already on the Archean Earth. While for the time span < 3.5 Ga the isotopic evidence is unequivocal, the information encoded in the preceding record is commonly blurred by a metamorphic overprint. This holds particularly for the metasediments of the 3.8 Ga old Isua Supracrustal Belt of West Greenland which, apart from widespread metasomatism, have suffered amphibolite-grade metamorphism. It is known that C-13/C-12 exchange occurs in organic (kerogenous) rock constituents during both amphibolite and granulite facies metamorphism if a second carbon partner is available (as either fluids or carbonate), with isotopic re-equilibration often only partially achieved due to the sluggish kinetics of the exchange reaction. Thermodynamic equilibria predict, however, that C-13/C-12 ratios in kerogen and graphite increase during this process. Hence, high-T exchange equilibria are always bound to drive <delta>C-13 values in positive direction, the lowermost values encountered being consequently the least exchanged and most pristine. With the lowest values of reduced (graphitic) carbon obtained in early Isua studies falling into the range - 22 to - 28(0)/(00) [PDB], we had straightforward evidence since the late 1970s that carbon constituents with the isotopic composition of biogenic matter were indeed present in the pre-metamorphic Isua suite. It was, therefore, by no means surprising that the results of recent isotope work performed on apatite-hosted carbonaceous microdomains in Isua banded iron-formation utilizing advanced techniques of instrumental microanalysis had prompted similar conclusions. Hence, the mainstream of the sedimentary carbon isotope record can be best interpreted as the geochemical manifestation of the isotope-discriminating properties of the principal CO2-fixing reactions(s) in biological carbon assimilation, suggesting an extreme degree of evolutionary conservatism in the biochemistry of autotrophic carbon fixation. As a consequence, biological modulation of the geochemical carbon cycle had been established at least 3.8 Ga ago, having been fully operative by the time of formation of the Earth's oldest sediments.

The evolution of the spectral features from an air plasma shows broadband radiation at early times followed by discrete electronic transitions from ions, atoms, and rotational and vibration bands from molecules. The molecular band emission from an air plasma typically appears at times equal to or greater than 5 mu s and persists for 100's of mu s. In this article, an evaluation is made on the temperature evolution and speciation in a laser-produced air plasma. The air plasmas are generated by focusing 1064 nm, 6 ns pulses from an Nd:YAG laser. High-resolution emission spectra of various molecules such as N-2, N-2(+), CN, OH, NH, and NO are acquired and fit using spectral models. Fitting of atomic and molecular emission features permits tracking of the air spark temperature evolution from 1 to 200 mu s. Though the excitation and molecular temperatures show a good overlap at times equal to or less than 10 mu s, the molecular temperatures obtained from different species show a discontinuity at times similar to 30 mu s and this is related to shock collapse and subsequent changes in hydrodynamics and chemistry of the plume. The fitting of multiple species in broadband spectra has permitted calculation of the relative concentrations of various molecules as a function of temperature that provides insight into the air spark speciation. The measured relative mole fractions from laser-induced air plasma are within factors of 2-6 of the values estimated by speciation model under the assumption of thermal and chemical equilibrium across the temperature ranges studied. Probable reasons for the observed deviation in the relative fractions are discussed. Published by AIP Publishing.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			1070-664X	1089-7674		WOS:000443730900097

For small concentrations of metal ions, the basicity of the glass host plays an important role in determining the valency of the transition metal (TM) ion. If one considers the molten glass as a solvent, the phosphates being more acceptor of O- than silicates and borates glasses, the oxidoreduction equilibrium is shifted towards the reduced state. More generally, the oxidoreduction (redox) reaction of TMm+/TM((m+1))(+) is related to the glass basicity and the possible complex ion formation by the following reaction: TMOp(m-2p) + (n -p - 1/2) O2- double left right arrow TMOn(m+ 1-2) -1/4 O-2. The oxygen ion activity (O2-) is thus related to the basicity and to the possibility of complex ion formation in the glass melt. For glasses containing large concentrations of transition metals, the valency of the metal ions depends mainly on the atmosphere, on the temperature of melting, and on the transition-metal concentration. According to the metal transition nature, the evolution of the redox ratio with the transition-metal concentration is different. TM cations present a large diversity of environments in glasses, which depend on their concentration and valency state. The octahedral (more and less deformed) coordination appears to be frequent for the transition metals in phosphate glasses. Exception is encountered with zinc metaphosphate. The Zn(IV) ions combine with Q(2) P sites to form a tetrahedral network, reminiscent of three-dimensional network glasses such as silica. Besides this simple cation coordination we found other cationic organisations: (i) complex oxide formation is sometimes described - VO2+, for example corresponds to a compressed octahedral site -; (ii) the progressive addition of TM may even leads to condensation of TM polyhedra it is the case during the addition of Nb2O3 in sodium borophosphate glasses; (iii) 'invert' glasses may also be observed for example, the titanophosphates are based on linkages between small phosphate anions and distorted octahedral titanate entities charge balanced by alkali. Spectroscopic methods used to characterise the local surrounding of transition metals are mainly optical absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, Mossbauer effect, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and wide-angle neutron scattering with isotopic substitution. The phosphoric anions network is investigated by Raman and IR spectroscopy and particularly with P-31 and O-17 solid-state NMR. New developments of NMR enable to characterise homoconnectivities between the phosphate groups and will allow one in the near future to undertake studies of heteconnectivities between phosphates and TM polyhedra.									55	0	0	0	0	0	55			1631-0748			WOS:000181309400004

To observe these basic steps is of great importance. Here we present a reliable and robust system to monitor these basic steps in powder photocatalysts, and more importantly to elucidate the key issue in photocatalytic methane conversion over the benchmark catalyst TiO2. Under constant excitation, the absorption signal across the NIR region was demonstrated to be dominated by photoexcited electrons, the absorption of photoexcited holes increases toward shorter wavelengths in the visible region, and the overall shapes of the photoinduced absorption spectra obtained using the system demonstrated in the present work are consistent with widely accepted transient absorption results. Next, in situ measurements provide direct experimental evidence that the initial step of methane activation over TiO2 involves oxidation by photoexcited holes. It is calculated that 90 +/- 6% of photoexcited electrons are scavenged by O-2 (in dry air), 61 +/- 9% of photoexcited holes are scavenged by methane (10% in argon), and a similar amount of photoexcited electrons can be scavenged by O-2 even when the O-2 concentration is reduced by a factor of 10. The present results suggest that O-2 is much more easily activated in comparison to methane over anatase TiO2, which rationalizes the much higher methane/O-2 ratio frequently used in practice in comparison to that required stoichiometrically for photocatalytic production of value-added chemicals via methane oxidation with oxygen. In addition, methanol (a preferable product of methane oxidation) is much more readily oxidized than methane over anatase TiO2.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000670659900051	34306811

The IL served as a dispersant, structure-directing agent and nitrogen source during the reaction, and facilitated the formation of a layered and mesoporous structure. Thus, NCSIL-900 exhibited developed micro/mesoporous characteristics in layered structures. When evaluated as an electrode material for supercapacitors, NCSIL-900 exhibited specific capacitance of 355 F/g at 0.2 A/g in (1 M H2SO4 electrolyte) and 275 F/g at 0.2 A/g in (6 M KOH electrolyte) in a three-electrode system. The values were 157.5 F/g at 0.5 A/g in (1 M H2SO4 electrolyte) and 120.8 F/g at 0.5 A/g in (6 M KOH electrolyte) in a two-electrode system. The layered porous structure and nitrogen-containing groups of NCSIL-900 contributed to its high specific capacitance. In this work, layered carbon materials that are promising candidates for electrode materials were prepared via a "green" route using "green" solvent and raw materials.

Herein, we report a series of flower-like electrocatalysts with cation-tunable (NixFe1-x)(2)P nanoparticles encapsulated by porous graphitized carbon films (GCs) via the combination of morphology control and component adjustment. By progressively tailoring the atomic ratios of Ni/Fe, the electronic structure and electrocatalytic activities of (NixFe1-x)(2)P can be intriguingly modified to achieve versatile catalytic behavior for both the HER and the OER. DFT calculations also validate that the (NixFe1-x)(2)P with an optimal atomic ratio of Ni/Fe can support the |Delta G(H*)| to be close to the optimum and decrease the adsorption energy for water, which can boost the water splitting. Meanwhile, anchoring the adjustable (NixFe1-x)(2)P nanoparticles into GC interlayers can endow these composites with more available active sites, excellent conductivity and enhanced stability. In fact, the combined synergistic effect of cation-tuned (NixFe1-x)(2)P nanoparticles and porous conductive GCs is the reason that these composites exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic activities, as illustrated by a low overpotential of 206 mV at j = 10 mA cm(-2) (256 mV at j = 50 mA cm(-2)) for the OER. Meanwhile, the bifunctional (Ni0.75Fe0.25)(2)P@GCs, as both the cathode and anode of an electrolyzer, effectuates an ultra-small cell potential of 1.541 V at j = 10 mA cm(-2) (1.573 V at j = 20 mA cm(-2)) for 30 h during electrolysis of water, rivaling commercial IrO2 and Pt/C catalysts. More importantly, this work can provide a way of fabricating cost-saving, component-tunable and high-efficiency bimetallic electrocatalysts for water splitting.									15	2	0	0	2	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000489686400029

Herein, a unique "raisins-on-bread" Ni-S-P electrocatalyst with NiS and Ni2P nanoparticles embedded in amorphous Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets is fabricated on Ni foam by a facile and controllable electrodeposition approach. It only requires an overpotential of 120 mV for HER and 219 mV for OER to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution. Employed as the anode and cathode, it demonstrates extraordinary electrocatalytic overall water splitting activity (cell voltage of only 1.58 V @ 10 mA cm(-2)) and ultra-stability (160 h @ 10 mA cm(-2) or 120 h @50 mA cm(-2)) in alkaline media. The synergetic electronic interactions, enhanced mass and charge transfers at the heterointerfaces facilitate HER and OER processes. Combined with a silicon PV cell, this Ni-S-P bifunctional catalyst also exhibits highly efficient solar-driven water splitting with a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 12.5%.

The PEC performance of a nanostructured photoelectrode is usually quantified in a standard three-electrode configuration under potential-assisted conditions because of the additional overpotentials for the two half-reactions of water splitting. However, it is a necessity to fully recognize their potential to split water under unassisted conditions by designing a tandem cell that can provide sufficient voltage to split water. Herein, we present a tandem cell consisting of carbon-modified cuprous oxide (C/Cu2O) nanoneedles and oxygen-deficient titanium dioxide (TiO2-x) nanorods for unassisted solar water splitting. The synthesized photoelectrodes were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The tandem cell performance was analyzed by measuring the current-voltage responses in various photoelectrode configurations to validate the collective contributions of both photoelectrodes to unassisted solar water splitting. The PEC properties of C/Cu2O nanoneedles coupled with TiO2-x nanorods in a tandem configuration exhibited a photocurrent density of 64.7 mu A cm(-2) in the absence of any redox mediator and external bias. This photocurrent density can be further enhanced with an application of external bias. Moreover, the heterojunction formed by the above-mentioned nanostructured photoelectrodes in intimate contact and in the absence of water exhibited 2 mu A cm(-2) UV photoresponsivity at 1.5 V with promising rectifying characteristics of a diode.									10	1	0	0	1	0	10			2046-2069			WOS:000468639300026	35519550

Nevertheless, whole cell approaches also bear disadvantages like intracellular degradation reactions, transport limitations as well as low substrate solubility. In this work the hydantoinase and carbamoylase from Arthrobacter crystallopoietes DSM 20117 were investigated with respect to their applicability in a cell-free hydantoinase process. Both enzymes were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli BL21DE3. Cultivation and induction of the hydantoinase under oxygen deficiency resulted in markedly higher specific activities and a further increase in expression was achieved by codon-optimization. Further expression conditions of the hydantoinase were tested using the microbioreactor system -BioLector (R), which showed a positive effect upon the addition of 3% ethanol to the cultivation medium. Additionally, the hydantoinase and carbamoylase were successfully purified by immobilized metal ion affinity using Ni Sepharose beads as well as by functionalized magnetic beads, while the latter method was clearly more effective with respect to recovery and purification factor. Immobilization of both enzymes via functionalized magnetic beads directly from the crude cell extract was successful and resulted in specific activities that turned out to be much higher than those of the purified free enzymes.									5	0	0	0	4	0	5			2191-0855			WOS:000403188200002	28605882

Oxygen and carbon isotopic analyses have been carried out on these carbonate veins, as well as on the dolostone layers found inside the Paleozoic metamorphic units of the deep part of the field (from 1939 to 3177 m below ground level), Fluid inclusion observations suggest that boiling processes probably occurred during calcite precipitation in most of the veins. The fluids that formed or interacted with the calcite veins below the uppermost reservoir (made up of Mesozoic marine carbonates), and with the calcite hydrothermal veins of Sassa, were characterised by an apparent salinity from 1.3 to 5.3 wt.% NaCl eq. and a homogenisation temperature from 137 to 245 degrees C. The fluid inclusions related to the calcite veins hosted above the uppermost reservoir show a wide range of apparent salinity (from 1.7 to 22.2 wt.% NaCl eq.) and homogenisation temperatures from 224 to 296 degrees C. Apparent salinity/homogenisation temperature covariations of the latter veins are interpreted as being the result of a mixing process between a low-temperature, high-salinity fluid and a higher-temperature, moderate-salinity fluid. The oxygen isotopic compositions of the calcite veins (delta(18)O from 10.34 to 11.45 parts per thousand) located below the Mesozoic carbonates and in the outcrops (delta(18)O from 9.42 to 17.07 parts per thousand) indicate that the vapour in equilibrium with these veins was isotopically similar to the present-day discharge steam. The aqueous fluids in equilibrium with these veins could be meteoric water that interacted with the Mesozoic carbonates of the upper reservoir, The delta(13)C values of the CO2 produced at Larderello and the constant concentration of this gas over time are, however, indicative of a deep source inside the reservoir that is probably related to the decarbonation reaction within the metamorphic units that form the present-day deep reservoir, Fluid inclusion salinities (up to 22.2 wt.% NaCl eq.) and isotopic results (delta(18)O from 13.43 to 21.99 parts per thousand, delta(13)C between -1.26 and -0.18 parts per thousand) on the calcite veins hosted above the uppermost reservoir suggest that the water circulating in these veins has strongly interacted with Mesozoic carbonates or Neogene sediments containing evaporite layers. The isotopic values (delta(18)O from 14.09 to 19.91 parts per thousand, delta(13)C from -4.09 to 1.90 parts per thousand) of dolomite samples present in the Paleozoic metamorphic rocks indicate a reaction with fluid of variable temperatures under different water/rock ratios. The isotopic composition of one sample reveals equilibrium with present-day discharge fluids. This fact aside, the remaining data indicate that the Paleozoic dolomitic layers do not seem to contribute significantly to the production of CO2.

Modeling the effects of diagenesis on carbonate clumped-isotope values in deep- and shallow-water settings								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				227				264	291		10.1016/j.gca.2018.01.037				APR 15 2018	2018	The measurement of multiply isotopically substituted ('clumped isotope') carbonate groups provides a way to reconstruct past mineral formation temperatures. However, dissolution-reprecipitation (i.e., recrystallization) reactions, which commonly occur during sedimentary burial, can alter a sample's clumped-isotope composition such that it partially or wholly reflects deeper burial temperatures. Here we derive a quantitative model of diagenesis to explore how diagenesis alters carbonate clumped-isotope values. We apply the model to a new dataset from deep-sea sediments taken from Ocean Drilling Project site 807 in the equatorial Pacific. This dataset is used to ground truth the model. We demonstrate that the use of the model with accompanying carbonate clumped-isotope and carbonate delta O-18 values provides new constraints on both the diagenetic history of deep-sea settings as well as past equatorial sea-surface temperatures. Specifically, the combination of the diagenetic model and data support previous work that indicates equatorial sea-surface temperatures were warmer in the Paleogene as compared to today. We then explore whether the model is applicable to shallow-water settings commonly preserved in the rock record. Using a previously published dataset from the Bahamas, we demonstrate that the model captures the main trends of the data as a function of burial depth and thus appears applicable to a range of depositional settings.

J	Manzoor, Dar; Krishnamurty, Sailaja; Pal, Sourav				Dar, Manzoor Ahmad/ABH-5797-2020	Dar, Manzoor Ahmad/0000-0002-2529-5453			Endohedrally doped gold nanocages: efficient catalysts for O-2 activation and CO oxidation								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				18	10			7068	7074		10.1039/c5cp05624a				MAR 14 2016	2016	Gold nanocages are the most attractive catalytic materials as all the atoms in the cage type clusters reside on the surface, making them available for chemisorption by reacting molecules. Due to a hollow space at the center, their chemical and catalytic properties can be tuned effectively and easily by endohedral doping. While a significant experimental and theoretical understanding is currently available on the structural and electronic properties of doped gold cages, very little information is available on their reactivity and catalytic behavior. In the present work, with the help of density functional theory calculations we demonstrate that endohedral doping leads to a notable increase in the binding energy of molecular oxygen on the gold nanocages. The enhancement in the O-2 binding energy on the doped gold cages is also confirmed by a significant decrease in the Au-O and an increase in the O-O bond lengths, corroborated by a red shift (similar to 250 cm(-1)) in the O-O stretching frequency as compared to the pristine cage. Furthermore, interestingly, the doped gold cages show very low activation barriers for the environmentally important CO oxidation reaction as compared to the pristine gold cage. Importantly, the decrease in the barrier height is comparatively greater for the rate limiting step of O-O-C-O intermediate formation and as a result the CO oxidation is expected to be more facile on the doped gold cages. Thus, the current study highlights the role of heteroatom doping in imparting new chemical and catalytic properties to gold cages and is expected to spur further research in the design of efficient gold nanocatalysts.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000371608600013	26628077

Analyses of the samples included elemental composition, various pyrolysis experiments and pyrolysis gas chromatography, organic solvent extraction, open-column liquid chromatographic fractionation, saturate fraction gas chromatography and combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and detailed organic petrography using reflected white and fluorescent light microscopy.The results obtained suggest that the Cretaceous sample has a "normal" coaly composition and low maturation in the lignite range whereas the Jurassic samples have unique maceral and geochemical characteristics that reveal evolution through two major stages. In the first stage, terrestrially derived organic material was accumulated under partially oxidizing conditions forming coaly deposits. Primarily terrestrial origin and oxidizing conditions are indicated, for example, by the constituent macerals, abundance of reaction rims (mainly on vitrinite and resinite macerals), abundance of alkylbenzenes, ratio of pristane to phytane, and distribution of n-alkane, sterance, and triterpane in the solvent extract of the samples. However, pulses of faster subsidence have resulted in formation of deeper lagoons. Consequently, coaly materials from the surrounding highs were eroded, transported, and redeposited within nearby lagoons. The transportation and redeposition were involved with selective removal of some of the humic substances, progressive bacterial degradation of some plant lipids, and further diagenesis under reducing conditions. The later modification resulted in enrichment of exinite, mainly bituminite, abundance of fluorescent vitrinite (including particles with reaction rims), and the relatively high hydrogen content indicated by the elemental and RockEval analyses. These effects are particularly pronounced in the organic-rich shale and less in the coal. Abundance of microlayering texture in the organic materials suggests that deposition during the later phase took place in shallow water in a low energy environment.The later modification under reducing conditions resulted in a relatively high hydrogen content in contrast to what is commonly anticipated for terrestrial materials that were deposited originally in oxidizing conditions. RockEval pyrolysis S2 indicates that the studied samples have the potential to generate hydrocarbons. However, vitrinite reflectance, UV-fluorescence, Tmax, and sterane and triterpane isomerization ratios indicate an immature to marginally mature level, suggesting that the samples studied did not reach the major phase of oil generation. In addition, because of the unique composition of the organic materials, the major products anticipated upon generation are gas, aromatics, and oxygen-rich compounds.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0090-8312			WOS:A1991FY29500008

The electronic structure of Ir is gradually tuned by varying the composition. The consistency of the fcc structure of Ru and Ir within the RuxIr1-x alloys allows better study of the electronic structure-activity relationship without introducing unnecessary factors such as the lattice/phase effect in the case of the RuIr alloy composed of different structures of hcp-Ru and fcc-Ir. The obtained RuxIr1-x alloys were further employed as precursors for the synthesis of their corresponding oxides, RuxIr1-xO2/CuO, to probe the electronic structure-activity relationship in the methane oxidation to methanol reaction. The electronic structure of Ir4+ was able to be regulated by tuning the composition of the RuxIr1-x NP precursors. The optimum catalytic behavior was achieved over Ru0.5Ir0.5O2/CuO, where both Ru and Ir reached the highest electrophilic state, at which point the C-H cleavage capacity also reached the maximum as observed by CH4-TPR.									7	2	0	0	1	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000593047100029

Synthesis and Characterization of an alpha-Fe2O3-Decorated g-C3N4 Heterostructure for the Photocatalytic Removal of MO								MOLECULES				27	4					1442	10.3390/molecules27041442				FEB 2022	2022	This study describes the preparation of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), hematite (alpha-Fe2O3), and their g-C3N4/alpha-Fe2O3 heterostructure for the photocatalytic removal of methyl orange (MO) under visible light illumination. The facile hydrothermal approach was utilized for the preparation of the nanomaterials. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) were carried out to study the physiochemical and optoelectronic properties of all the synthesized photocatalysts. Based on the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV-visible diffuse reflectance (DRS) results, an energy level diagram vs. SHE was established. The acquired results indicated that the nanocomposite exhibited a type-II heterojunction and degraded the MO dye by 97%. The degradation ability of the nanocomposite was higher than that of pristine g-C3N4 (41%) and alpha-Fe2O3 (30%) photocatalysts under 300 min of light irradiation. The formation of a type-II heterostructure with desirable band alignment and band edge positions for efficient interfacial charge carrier separation along with a larger specific surface area was collectively responsible for the higher photocatalytic efficiency of the g-C3N4/alpha-Fe2O3 nanocomposite. The mechanism of the nanocomposite was also studied through results obtained from UV-vis and XPS analyses. A reactive species trapping experiment confirmed the involvement of the superoxide radical anion (O-2(& BULL;-)) as the key reactive oxygen species for MO removal. The degradation kinetics were also monitored, and the reaction was observed to be pseudo-first order. Moreover, the sustainability of the photocatalyst was also investigated.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1420-3049		WOS:000774952200001	35209230

To date, a comprehensive analysis of LOX genes and their biological functions in response to abiotic stresses in peanut has not been performed. In this study, a total of 72 putative LOX genes were identified in cultivated (Arachis hypogaea) and wild-type peanut (Arachis duranensis and Arachis ipaensis) and classified into three subfamilies: 9-LOX, type I 13-LOX and type II 13-LOX. The gene structures and protein motifs of these peanut LOX genes were highly conserved among most LOXs. We found that the chromosomal distribution of peanut LOXs was not random and that gene duplication played a crucial role in the expansion of the LOX gene family. Cis-acting elements related to development, hormones, and biotic and abiotic stresses were identified in the promoters of peanut LOX genes. The expression patterns of peanut LOX genes were tissue-specific and stress-inducible. Quantitative real-time PCR results further confirmed that peanut LOX gene expression could be induced by drought, salt, methyl jasmonate and abscisic acid treatments, and these genes exhibited diverse expression patterns. Furthermore, overexpression of AhLOX29 in Arabidopsis enhanced the resistance to drought stress. Compared with wide-type, AhLOX29-overexpressing plants showed significantly decreased malondialdehyde contents, as well as increased chlorophyll degradation, proline accumulation and superoxide dismutase activity, suggesting that the transgenic plants exhibit strengthened capacity to scavenge reactive oxygen species and prevent membrane damage. This systematic study provides valuable information about the functional characteristics of AhLOXs in the regulation of abiotic stress responses of peanut.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1664-462X			WOS:000798721800001	35356112

Here we report a transformative approach using an oxidative chemical vapour deposition technique to build a protective conductive polymer (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)) skin on layered oxide cathode materials. The ultraconformal poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) skin facilitates the transport of lithium ions and electrons, significantly suppresses the undesired layered to spinel/rock-salt phase transformation and the associated oxygen loss, mitigates intergranular and intragranular mechanical cracking, and effectively stabilizes the cathode-electrolyte interface. This approach remarkably enhances the capacity and thermal stability under high-voltage operation. Building a protective skin at both secondary and primary particle levels of layered oxides offers a promising design strategy for Ni-rich cathodes towards high-energy, long-life and safe lithium-ion batteries.									213	11	0	0	8	0	215			2058-7546			WOS:000471295000015

Control of Ag nanofoam structure and its electrocatalytic performance in bromobenzene reductive debromination via variation of electrodeposition conditions								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				579						152131	10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.152131		DEC 2021		MAR 30 2022	2022	Silver nanofoams were obtained on silver surface via electrodeposition from acidic aqueous electrolyte (AgNO3 + HBF4) under high current densities. The nanofoams consist of irregularly shaped Ag filaments (mean width 100-450 nm) arranged in walls surrounding void craters (mean diameter 7-40 mu m). Synthesis parameters (AgNO3 and HBF4 concentrations, deposition time, current density) were varied, and it was found that the higher the value of any synthesis parameter, the higher the observed mean crater diameter. An increase in the deposition time and current density also resulted in higher surface roughness. The higher Ag+ concentration led to higher mean filament width as well. The electrocatalytic performance of the nanofoams was studied via cyclic voltammetry by comparing potentials and currents of the peak corresponding to the bromobenzene reduction. All nanofoams were notably more electrocatalytically active in the reaction than bulk silver (potentials were at least 200 mV less negative), but, unexpectedly, the significant changes in their structure resulted only in moderate adjustment of their activity (the peak potentials varied within 60 mV). These observations allowed us to choose the explanation of the superior nanofoams activity among several suppositions, namely, the presence of some kind of active sites on the facets of the nanofoam forming particles.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000736694400001

In one of our recent works, by analyzing the electrochemical experimental data, we showed that computational cyclic voltammetry simulation (CCVS) can be used to predict the possible ERM of heterometallo-SMP (HMSMP) during electrochemical oxidation of nitrite (Islam, T.et al.ACS Appl. Polym. Mater. 2020, 2(2), 273-284). However, CCVS cannot predict how the ERM happens at the molecular level. Thus, in this work, we simulated the interactions between the repeating unit (RU) of the HMSMP polyNiCo and nitrite to understand how the oxidation process took place at the molecular level. The RU for studying the ERM was confirmed through comparing the simulated UV/vis and IR spectra with the experimental spectra. Then, the simulations between the RU of the polyNiCo and various species of nitrite were done for gaining insights into the ERM. The simulations revealed that the first electron transfer (ET) occurred through coordination of NO2- with either of the metal centers during the two-electron-transfer oxidation of nitrite, while the second ET followed a ligand-ligand charge transfer (LLCT) and metal-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) pathway between the NO2 species and the RU. This ET pathway has been proposed by analyzing the transition states (TSs), simulated UV/vis spectra, energy of the optimized systems, and highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) interactions from the simulations between the RU and nitrite species.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2470-1343			WOS:000541503700031	32548472

Structural and morphological properties of BiFeO3 (BFO) nanoparticles, BGFSO nanoparticles, NG and BGFSO/NG, were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The crystallite size BGFSO nanoparticle is about 20 nm. The photocatalytic activities of the as-prepared BiFeO3 (BFO) nanoparticles, BGFSO, NG and BGFSO/NG nanohybrid were measured by the degradation of methyl orange (MO) under simulated sunlight irradiation. BGFSO/N-G nanohybrid shows enhanced photocatalytic activity. The improved photo catalytic activity is attributed to the effective transfer of photogenerated electrons from nanoparticles NG nanosheets, consequently leads to an increased availability of h + for the photocatalytic reaction.

The water oxidation half- reaction has always represented the bottleneck of this process because of the thermodynamic and kinetic challenges that are involved. Several materials have been explored and studied to address the issues pertaining to solar water oxidation. Significant advances have recently been made in the use of stable and relatively cheap metal oxides, i.e., semiconducting photocatalysts. The use of BiVO4 for this purpose can be considered advantageous because this catalyst is able to absorb a substantial portion of the solar spectrum and has favourable conduction and valence band edge positions. However, BiVO4 is also associated with poor electron mobility and slow water oxidation kinetics and these are the problems that are currently being investigated in the ongoing research in this field. This review focuses on the most recent advances in the best-performing BiVO4-based photoanodes to date. It summarizes the critical parameters that contribute to the performance of these photoanodes, and highlights so far unresolved critical features related to the scale-up of a BiVO4-based PEC water-splitting device.									164	6	0	0	7	1	166				2073-4344		WOS:000395426100013

The latter form is active on monophenols, while the former is not. However, the kinetics are complicated because monophenols can bind to both enzyme forms. This situation becomes even more complex since the products of the enzymatic reaction, the o-quinones, are unstable and continue evolving to generate o-diphenols in the medium. In the case of substrates such as L-tyrosine, tyrosinase generates very unstable o-quinones, in which a process of cyclation and subsequent oxidation-reduction generates o-diphenol through non-enzymatic reactions. However, the release of o-diphenol through the action of the enzyme on the monophenol contributes to the concentration of o-diphenol in the first pseudo-steady-state [D-0](ss). Hence, the system reaches an initial pseudo-steady state when t --> 0 and undergoes a transition phase (lag period) until a final steady state is reached when the concentration of o-diphenol in the medium reaches the concentration of the final steady state [D-f](ss). These results can be explained by taking into account the kinetic and structural mechanism of the enzyme. In this, tyrosinase hydroxylates the monophenols to o-diphenols, generating an intermediate, EmD, which may oxidise the o-diphenol or release it directly to the medium. We surmise that the intermediate generated during the action of E-ox on monophenols, EmD, has axial and equatorial bonds between the o-diphenol and copper atoms of the active site. Since the orbitals are not coplanar, the concerted oxidation-reduction reaction cannot occur. Instead, a bond, probably that of C-4, is broken to achieve coplanarity, producing a more labile intermediate that will then release the o-diphenol to the medium or reunite it diaxially, involving oxidation to o-quinone. The non-enzymatic evolution of the o-quinone would generate the o-diphenol ([D-f](ss)) necessary for the final steady state to be reached after the lag period. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, severe interfacial instability and safety concerns on rechargeable LMA, associated with Li dendrite formation, continuous side reactions, and infinite volume changes, extremely hinder its commercialization. Numerous strategies have been employed to modify LMA for realizing a uniform distribution of the Li ion flux through interface and dendrite-free Li deposits during repeated Li plating/stripping, which leads to a better cycling performance; however, to the best of our knowledge, a clear understanding of the Li deposition/dissolution behavior and the nucleation growth mechanism of Li dendrites is still lacking, which is conducive to more efficient modification studies on LMA. Therefore, it is critical to achieve considerable progress in the development of advanced characterization techniques. However, the high reactivity of Li metal, which leads to complexity of products and diversity in morphology, causes many difficulties in the characterization of in situ spectroscopy. Recently, some promising characterization techniques have been introduced to further investigate the evolution of LMA during cycling, such as cryoelectron microscopy, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance technology, and neutron depth profiling (NDP) technique. Because of its high-penetration characteristics, quantitative and nondestructive merits, and highly selective sensitivity to Li-6 via the capture reaction with neutrons, the NDP technique shows a broad application prospect for obtaining real-time information of the electrochemical behavior of Li in Li metal batteries. The NDP results contain a wealth of information about time and space for Li. Accordingly, not only can the real-time distribution and migration of Li ions be detected, but also changes in the active sites of Li deposition/dissolution can be analyzed to understand the formation principle of Li dendrites and the failure mechanism of Li metal batteries. In addition, the NDP technique has shown its potential in the diagnosis and prediction of short circuit in Li metal batteries, which is confirmed through voltage curves. This review first briefly introduces the principle of the NDP technique and the methods for improving its space/time resolution; second, it summarizes the recent use of the NDP technique in the research on LMAs based on liquid or solid cell systems. Finally, it provides a prospect for the future development of NDP technique.									1	1	0	0	0	0	1			1000-6818			WOS:000614200300009

This process leads to acidification of the lumen and ATP synthesis. Water oxidation occurs in a flash-induced, five-step S-n state cycle; acetate is a chloride-dependent inhibitor of the S-2 to S-3 step of this cycle. Here, we study the effect of acetate on a previous step of the cycle, the S-1 to S-2 transition, using reaction-induced infrared spectroscopy. PSII was isolated from spinach, and experiments were conducted at pH 7.5, using 532 nm laser flashes to advance the cycle from the dark-adapted state S-1 to the S-2 state. Isotope-editing of acetate reveals direct contributions to the S-2 minus-S-1 infrared spectrum consistent with protonation of bound acetate in PSII. In the acetate-derived S-2-minus-S-1 PSII spectra, an accompanying decrease in the intensity of a 2830 cm(-1) band is observed when compared to the chloride control. The 2830 cm(-1) band has been assigned previously to a stretching vibration of an internal, hydrated hydronium ion, W-n(+). Density functional studies of a catalytic site model predict the spontaneous transfer of a proton from this internal hydronium ion to acetate, when acetate is substituted at a chloride-binding site. Taken together, the results show that the mechanism of PSII proton transfer at pH 7.5 involves proton hopping through an internal, water-containing network.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1520-6106			WOS:000470045700003	31099580

In the present work, bimetallic Ru-Cu catalyst supported on carbon nanotube (RuCu/CNT) was prepared and the structural properties of the catalysts were characterized. The results show that the presence of Ru enhances the dispersion and reduction of Cu particles in the RuCu/CNT catalyst in comparison with the monometallic Cu catalyst supported on CNT (Cu/CNT). For electrocatalytic reaction on Cu/CNT, bromate is reduced on metallic Cu surface via a redox process. For Ru/CNT, highly active H* radicals are generated on metallic Ru surface via the Volmer process and are used for bromate reduction. As for the RuCu/CNT, bromate is reduced through two main pathways, including direct redox reaction on metallic Cu and indirect reduction by active H* radicals on Ru surface. Accordingly, RuCu/CNT exhibits the highest catalytic activity, ascribed to the synergistic effect between metallic Ru and Cu. Furthermore, the bimetallic catalyst displays much higher catalytic efficiency as compared with previously reported results. The pH, initial bromate concentration, in-situ electrochemical reduction of the electrodes and working potential have strong impacts on the removal efficiency of bromate on RuCu/CNT.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000831136000005	35999744

Although electrocatalytic water splitting has been proposed for decades, large-scale industrial hydrogen production is hindered by high electricity cost, capital investment, and electrolysis media. Harsh conditions (strong acid/alkaline) are widely used in electrocatalytic mechanism studies, and excellent catalytic activities and efficiencies have been achieved. However, the practical application of electrocatalytic water splitting in harsh conditions encounters several obstacles, such as corrosion issues, catalyst stability, and membrane technical difficulties. Thus, the research on water splitting in mild conditions (neutral/near neutral), even in natural seawater, has aroused increasing attention. However, the mechanism in mild conditions or natural seawater is not clear. Herein, different conditions in electrocatalytic water splitting are reviewed and the effects and proposed mechanisms in the three conditions are summarized. Then, a comparison of the reaction process and the effects of the ions in different electrolytes are presented. Finally, the challenges and opportunities associated with direct electrocatalytic natural seawater splitting and the perspective are presented to promote the progress of hydrogen production by water splitting.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000728051800001	34878210

The development of active and stable non-noble metal electrocatalysts for MOR is desired, but remains a challenge. Herein, we report a simple strategy to make copper nanocrystal/nitrogen-doped carbon (Cu/N-C) monoliths, which can serve as active and robust electrodes for MOR. Copper nanocrystals were electrochemically deposited onto a conductive polyaniline hydrogel and calcined to form Cu/N-C monolith, where the active copper nanocrystals are protected by nitrogen-doped carbon. Owing to their extremely high electrical conductivity (1.25 x 10(5) S cm(-1)) and mechanical robustness, these Cu/N-C monoliths can be directly used as electrodes for MOR, without using substrates or additives. The optimal Cu/N-C (FT)@500 monolith shows a high MOR activity of 189 mA cm(-2) at 0.6 V vs. SCE in alkaline methanol solution, superior to most of reported Cu-based MOR catalysts. Cu/N-C (FT)@500 also presents a better stability than Pt/C catalyst in the long-term MOR test at high current densities. Upon carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, Cu/N-C (FT)@500 retains 96% of its MOR activity, far exceeding the performance of Pt/C catalyst (61% retention). Owing to its facile synthesis, outstanding activity, high stability and mechanical robustness, Cu/N-C (FT)@500 monolith is promising as a low-cost, efficient and CO-resistant electrocatalyst for MOR.

Through DFT calculations, we designed Pt cluster decorated Ni(OH)(2) nanoparticles (Pt/Ni(OH)(2)) as robust cocatalyst capable of activating H2O and dissociating HO-H bonds. Then the unique structure was fabricated through in-situ photo oxidation of Ni2P to Ni(OH)(2) on semiconductor like C3N4 and subsequent selective photo-deposition of Pt on Ni (OH)(2) surface. Pt/Ni(OH)(2)-C3N4 is much more active in photocatalytic HER, OER and overall water splitting compared with Pt, Ni(OH)(2) and spatially separated co-loaded Ni(OH)(2)-Pt on C3N4. And Pt/Ni(OH)(2)-C3N4 achieves an AQE of L8% at 420 nm in overall water splitting by using only 0.3 wt% Pt, superior to most solid-state photocatalytic systems to date. Moreover, Pt/Ni(OH)(2) composite enables TiO2 to split pure water in good stoichiometry. This work emphasizes the importance of H2O activation and may pave the way for enabling single semiconductors to efficiently split pure water.									76	6	0	0	6	0	76			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000453616800027

The NH3 atmosphere promoted the formation of sulfur doped g-C3N4 nanosheets with a hierarchical pore structure and a high specific surface area. Carbon vacancies were also generated in the SCNNSs without notably changing the overall chemical structure. The obtained SCNNSs-550 showed a photocatalytic nitrogen fixation rate of 5.99mMh(-1) gCat(-1) under simulated sunlight irradiation within 4 h, which is 2.8 times as high as that of bulk SCN. This superior photocatalytic performance of SCNNSs was attributed to the porous sheet structure with sulfur doping and carbon vacancies, which provide many active sites for surface reactions and increase the charge-carrier separation rate. This novel synthetic method provides a simple and efficient way to dope nonmetals and form a defect structure in g-C3N4 for excellent photocatalytic performance.									202	8	0	0	29	0	203			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000441527900014

The electrochemical behavior shows dependence on the cathodic potential limit employed, and a good potential window (1.4 V) in aqueous NaOH and high electrocatalytic area due to the contribution of different redox transitions of Ir and Co surface sites. The electrode has been found to perform as superior electrodes in electrochemical capacitor applications with a specific capacitance of 500-600 F g(-1). The large capacitance exhibited by this system arises from a combination of the double layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance associated with surface redoxtype reactions.

Little information on PSII architecture is available; even the oligomeric nature of the complex is contentious, with various predictions of monomeric1, dimeric and tetrameric2-4 forms. Biochemistry suggests that it consists of an outer shell of easily removable light-harvesting proteins and a more resistant core5. The core itself can be split into further light-harvesting proteins and a reaction centre5,6. The reaction centre polypeptides bind the electron transfer components, and probably contain amino-acid residues liganded to the cluster of four Mn atoms that is believed to constitute the water 'splitting' site6-8. We report here the first, to our knowledge, three-dimensional functionally intact structure of PSII higher plants, complete with antennae and core light-harvesting proteins. Our model has been obtained by digital image processing of ordered two-dimensional arrays of the complex, such as have often been observed4,9-12.									93	2	0	0	70	0	96			0028-0836			WOS:A1993LE93800065

However, it's still a challenging task to eliminate the constraint of sacrificial agents. Herein, by integrating the architecture guidance and energy band engineering into the design conception, a novel CdS@Ti3C2@CoO hierarchical tandem p-n heterojunction photocatalytic system is designed and prepared for the first time. Ti3C2 nanosheets not only solve the compatibility problem between CdS and CoO but also function as a bridge to consolidate them into a special tandem p-n heterojunction where two secondary internal electric fields are set up and combined into the strong internal electric field existing in the p-n heterojunction. The triple-internal electric field can dramatically boost the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers and realize the regulation of their spatial motion. This specific photocatalytic system exhibits superior photocatalytic performance with a H-2 evolution activity of 134.46 mu mol.h(-1).g(-1) and excellent stability without any sacrificial agents. Our work introduces a potential avenue to design efficient photocatalysts by constructing multi-hierarchical systems toward practical application in solar energy conversion.									43	3	0	0	5	0	43			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000504404800030

High resolution (20 step release) nitrogen isotopic data are obtained in a 0.2 g metal chip which contains 33.1 ppm N of deltaN-15(parts per thousand) = -94.8 +/- 1.1. Two troilite samples each contain 1.13 ppm N with signatures deltaN-15(parts per thousand) = -10.7 and -3.8, respectively. Spallogenic Ne-21c is nineteen times more abundant in troilite than in metal due to cosmic ray reactions on sulphur. However, the distinct nitrogen isotopic signatures of troilite cannot be accounted for by the additional presence of spallogenic nitrogen. The nitrogen isotopic signatures of the metal for the temperature steps greater-than-or-equal-to 1200-degrees are within a narrow range of 4parts per thousand and reveal a light N reservoir of deltaN-15(parts per thousand) = -94.8parts per thousand in Cape York. The nitrogen isotopic signatures of the metal and troilite phases appear to conflict with a proposed magmatic origin, unless the observed signature in troilite is due to a secondary alteration process. We discuss possible genetic links between iron meteorite groups based on nitrogen isotopic signatures in metal and oxygen isotopic signatures in silicate inclusions. Our nitrogen isotopic studies reveal artifacts due to adsorption/desorption of N2 by reactive metal vapors deposited on the surfaces of the quartz extraction system, and we discuss an extraction protocol which reduces nitrogen loss and exchange effects.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0016-7037			WOS:A1994NF22200011

Herein, we proposed a Bi, Ni co-doping strategy to construct internal electric field in CdS and, thus, restrain the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, achieving a powerful water splitting photocatalysis. The as-synthesized Bi-, Ni-codoped CdS catalyst (Bi/Ni-CdS) presented a coralloid morphology with a large specific surface area (ca. 150.09 m(2)/g). Besides, the Bi and Ni dopants could conspicuously narrow the band gap of CdS from 2.2 to 1.5 eV, enhancing its visible-light harnessing ability. Therefore, Bi/Ni-CdS exhibited an enhanced photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate of ca. 5294.4 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), which was twentyfold higher than pure CdS under visible-light irradiation (lambda >= 400 nm). From the test and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results, the doped Bi and Ni atoms could synergistically regulate the electron density of Cd and S atoms and build an internal electric field in Bi-10/Ni-6-CdS, thereby hindering the charge carriers recombination and increasing hydrogen evolution rate significantly. Furthermore, the excellent water splitting of Bi-10/Ni-6-CdS related to the improved electrons generation and migration properties as well.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000651206800006

The addition also promoted the AsA-GSH cycle, photosynthesis, and the biomass accumulations on vitamin C, soluble solids, soluble protein, and soluble sugar. Among the treatments, the 48 mg·L~(-1) magnesium addition in the culture substrate rendered the most significant improvements on the growth and development of C. lanatus. Whereas, either a deficiency (at 0 mg·L~(-1)) or an excess (e.g., at 192 mg·L~(-1)) on the nutrient ill-affected the membrane lipid peroxidation and shortened the plant roots. Furthermore, the chlorophyll fluorescence declined as indicated by the lower oxygen evolution complex (OEC), quantum yield for electron transport (phiEo), and receptor library capacity (Sm), the density of reaction centers (RC/CSo) decreased, the light energy absorption per unit reaction center (ABS/RC) lowered, and the dissipative (DI0/RC), capture (TR0/RC), and QA reduction rate (Mo) increased. Thus, either deprivation or over-supply of magnesium could significantly disrupt the normal photosynthetic function inhibiting the growth of C. lanatus. 【Conclusion】 Particularly in deficiency, but also in excess, magnesium in soil could diminish the PSII activity and retard the growth of C. lanatus. Appropriate application of the nutrient, such as at 48 mg·L~(-1) concentration in soil, could effectively improve the physiological activity, stabilize the structure and function of PSII, strengthen the leaf photosynthesis to result in healthy growth and high quality fruit production of C. lanatus.			【目的】探讨镁营养对西瓜(Citrullus lanatus)生长发育和生理代谢的影响,明确西瓜生长的适宜镁浓度范围。【方法】采用砂培法,对西瓜进行5个施镁质量浓度(0 、24 、48、96和192 mg·L~(-1))处理,并测定西瓜在不同施镁浓度下的生长特性(叶片和根系形态、生物量积累)、果实品质(维生素C、可溶性固形物、可溶性蛋白和可溶性糖含量)、叶绿素荧光特性和生理响应(渗透调节、膜伤害和抗氧化酶系统)。【结果】用24 ~ 96 mg·L~(-1)的镁素可以降低西瓜叶片膜伤害,提高光系统Ⅱ(PSII)活性,增加叶片抗氧化物质谷胱甘肽(glutathione, GSH)和还原型抗坏血酸(reduced ascorbic acid, AsA)含量,增强叶片抗氧化酶活性,包括过氧化物酶(peroxidase, POD)、超氧化物歧化酶(superoxide dismutase, SOD)、过氧化氢酶(catalase, CAT)和单脱氢抗坏血酸还原酶(monodehydroascorbate reductase, DHAR),降低叶片丙二醛(malondialdehyde, MDA)和脯氨酸(proline, Pro)含量以及细胞膜透性,促进AsA-GSH循环,增强光合作用,提高生物量积累,增加果实中维生素C、可溶性固形物、可溶性蛋白和可溶性糖含量。其中,48 mg·L~(-1)镁处理对西瓜的生长发育增效最明显,而缺镁(0 mg·L~(-1))和镁过量(192 mg·L~(-1))胁迫下,西瓜叶片产生膜脂过氧化伤害,根系变短,叶绿素荧光参数放氧复合体(OEC)、电子传递量子产额(phiEo)、受体库容量(Sm)和单位面积反应中心数量(RC/CSo)降低,单位反应中心光能的吸收(ABS/RC)、耗散(DI0/RC)、捕获(TR0/RC)及QA还原速率(Mo)增加,叶片光合机构完整性被破坏,光合作用减弱,西瓜生长受到明显抑制,其中缺镁影响最严重。【结论】缺镁和镁过量处理降低西瓜PSII活性,抑制西瓜生长,而适量增施镁可有效提高西瓜的生理活性,PSII的结构和功能稳定,光合作用强,西瓜生长好,果实品质高,48 mg·L~(-1)为西瓜栽培最适宜施镁质量浓度。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1008-0384			CSCD:7140108

Potential electrochemical catalysts for the MFC have to be widely available and should be low cost materials. Graphite, MnO2 and MoS2 fulfill the requirements and were evaluated in this work. These materials were prepared by dispersion of MnO2 and/or MoS2 and graphite in a solution of celluloid using butanone as solvent. Four MFCs with an active area of 225 cm(2) were connected in series with the wastewater supply. Their individual maximum output power densities were evaluated in relation to time. The results showed that MFC without catalyst reached a power density of only 40 mW/m(2), while the best performance of MFC with graphite plus MnO2 coating (10: 1) was higher than 100 mW/m(2). Comparing with graphite plus MnO2 coating, the graphite plus MoS2 paint shows a lower power density but much higher long-term stability than graphite plus MnO2 coating. The scaling up of MFC with catalyst on the cathode is also studied in this research. Four MFCs with dimension of 980 cm2 were constructed and connected in series, whose anodes have two sides for enlargement of reaction surface area. (C) The Author(s) 2016. Published by ECS.

Compared to traditional photocatalysts, 2D COFs for photocatalytic water splitting show the advantages of controllable light absorption and easy carrier separation. Here, we fabricate a highly crystalline 2D COF with hierarchical pore structures and donor-acceptor (D-A) moieties consisting of electron donor tetraphenylethylene (4PE) and electron acceptor thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (TZ), the PETZ-COF. Owing to the specific molecular configuration and microstructures, the PETZ-COF demonstrates remarkable properties in visible-light-driven H-2 evolution and a suitable energy band structure for O-2 generation. The PETZ-COF shows an excellent hydrogen evolution rate of 7324.3 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) in the presence of a Pt co-catalyst and using ascorbic acid as the hole sacrificial reagent. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the site with the lowest hydrogen-binding free energy (Delta G(H*)) is the N atom in the -N[double bond, length as m-dash]C- (-0.0418 eV) group, which suggests that the electron withdrawing-pushing interaction in D-A parts may facilitate hydrogen adsorption and thus contribute to H-2 formation. Besides, the hierarchical pore structure involving micropores, mesopores and macropores was also thought to exert an important influence on the photocatalytic performance. This work provides an effective design and synthetic strategy to prepare highly active COF-based photocatalysts for solar energy harvesting and conversion.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000787381200001		
J	NEDUNCHEZHIAN, N; KULANDAIVELU, G								INCREASED STABILITY OF THYLAKOID COMPONENTS IN VIGNA-SINENSIS L SEEDLINGS GROWN UNDER ULTRAVIOLET-B ENHANCED RADIATION								PHOTOSYNTHETICA				29	3			369	375						1993	1993	Chloroplasts isolated from Vigna sinensis L. seedlings grown under cool fluorescent (control chloroplasts) and ultraviolet-B (UV-B)-enhanced fluorescent (UV chloroplasts) radiation, when incubated at 10, 20, 30 and 40-degrees-C, showed large variations in the photosynthetic electron transport reactions. The overall electron transport activity in both control and UV chloroplasts incubated at 40-degrees-C decreased rapidly. In contrast to this, at 30-degrees-C the control chloroplasts got inactivated very rapidly during the 30 min of incubation while the UV chloroplasts showed high stability. A similar trend was also noticed at 20-degrees-C. At 10-degrees-C, although the rate of inactivation was slow, UV chloroplasts were more stable than control chloroplasts. A similar trend was noticed in photosystem (PS) 2 activity. In contrast to overall electron transport and PS2 reactions, PS1 activity showed only marginal changes at all temperatures. The polypeptide profiles of chloroplasts exposed to UV-B irradiation for 60 min at different temperatures revealed marked decreases in the level of the 23 and 33 kDa polypeptides in control chloroplasts while in UV chloroplasts these polypeptides were highly stable. In addition, UV chloroplasts contained several new polypeptides of both high and low molecular masses. The polypeptide pattern indicated that higher photochemical activity of UV chloroplasts over the control chloroplasts could be due to stabilization of PS2 core complexes by the new polypeptides induced under UV-B enhanced radiation.									9	1	0	0	9	0	10			0300-3604			WOS:A1993NA95600006

Hydrogen is considered as a new type of energy because of its high calorific value, no environmental pollution and low cost of raw materials. In this experiment, to improve the visible-light driven catalytic activity of two-dimensional g-C3N4, g-C3N4 and Ag/AgBr nanoparticles (NPs) were used as the carrier and cocatalyst, and the g-C3N4/Ag/AgBr (CNAA-alpha, alpha = 1, 2 and 3) heterojunction photocatalysts with different amounts of Ag/AgBr were synthesized via solvothermal technology. The morphology, composition, structure, photochemical and electrochemical characteristics of the samples were analyzed through XRD, FTIR, TEM, XPS and a series of photoelectrochemical characterizations, and the visible-light driven catalytic hydrogen evolution activities of the samples were studied by catalyzing water splitting. Research showed that the CNAA-2 exhibited the smallest overvoltage (86.5 mV vs RHE) and Tafel slope (61.0 mV.dec(-1)), so that the highest photocatalytic activity (47.84 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1)) for hydrogen evolution was obtained at the absence of Pt co-catalyst. Furthermore, this heterojunction photocatalyst exhibited good photostability and could be recycled several times with no significant decrease of its activity. This indicated that the addition of Ag/AgBr NPs to the two-dimensional g-C3N4 nanosheets to construct an effective p-n heterojunction system at their interfaces could promote the conduction of photo-induced carriers and inhibit their combination, so that it would significantly improve the photoresponse ability and catalytic activity of two-dimensional g-C3N4 nanosheets.									25	1	1	0	3	0	27			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000487838900033

The presented studies have fundamental meaning and will mainly focus on a detailed synthesis description of undoped structures, researching their possible polymorphism in various conditions and hinting at some nontrivial physicochemical properties like charge transfer for upcoming optical studies after eventual doping with selectively chosen rare-earth ions. The formerly mentioned, targeted A(2)BB'X-6 group of compounds contains mainly divalent alkali cations in the form of (XII)A = Ba2+, Ca2+ sharing, here, oxygen-arranged clusters (X-II = O2-) with purposely selected central ions from f-block B-VI = Ce4/3+ and d-block B-VI' = W4/5/6+ since together they often possess some exotic properties that could be tuned and implemented into futuristic equipment like sensors or energy converters. Techniques like powder XRD, XPS, XAS, EPR, Raman, and FTIR spectroscopies alongside DSC and TG were involved with an intent to thoroughly describe any possible changes within these materials. Mainly, to have a full prospect of any desirable or undesirable phenomena before diving into more complicated subjects like: energy or charge transfer in low temperatures; to reveal whether or not the huge angular tilting generates large enough dislocations within the material's unit cell to change its initial properties; or if temperature and pressure stimuli are responsible for any phase transitions and eventual, irreversible decomposition.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2470-1343			WOS:000820415100001	35694470

However, there have been many observational contradictions in PL measurements presented in the past literature. This work addresses such issues. Firstly, the observational changes of the flakes' PL patterns under exposure to various intensities of radiant exposure via laser sources are presented. These experiments show that these changes are a function of radiant exposure. Interestingly, it is observed that PL loss is accompanied by a change of the profile height for WS2 monolayers. In order to explore the fundamental mechanism for PL and height variations, laser irradiation was applied to monolayer WS2 flakes with varying radiant exposure to obtain PL maps, under the absence and presence of oxygen, H2O and nitrogen molecules in the atmosphere. It was seen that, after relatively high radiant exposure (> 15 mJ mu m(-2)), the PL pattern loss occurs only in the presence of atmospheric H2O molecules (45% humidity) and is also accompanied by an increase in height. Compositional analysis determined that this height increase was due to the substitution of surface S atoms with sulphate groups. This discovery represents an important step forward in understanding the necessary precautions when investigating optical properties of 2D TMDs in atmospheric conditions, and highlights the need for precise evaluation of the thresholds for radiant exposure at which specific reactions begin to occur. This knowledge is crucial for efficient and effective control of ambient operating conditions for optical characterisation of monolayer WS2 and TMDs in general.									24	2	0	0	3	0	24			2053-1583			WOS:000413544200001

The catalytic mechanism was studied by electrochemical experiments and density functional theory calculations to elucidate the following steps: (a)one of two water molecules in 1 is exchanged by OAc- to generate [NiL(H2O)(OAc)](+) when dissolved in OAc- buffer, (b)Ni-II is directly oxidized to Ni-IV and OAc- is replaced with OH- to form [(NiL)-L-IV(OH)(2)](2+), and (c)a peroxide intermediate is formed through the intramolecular O-O coupling in the presence of OAc-, which undergoes further oxidation to release O-2.									59	3	0	0	6	0	59			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000372191600010	26785219	
J	Berger, Alan; Newman, John								An Integrated 1-Dimensional Model of a Photoelectrochemical Cell for Water Splitting								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				161	8			E3328	E3340		10.1149/2.035408jes				2014	2014	A one-dimensional model of a photoelectrochemical cell for solar water splitting has been developed, with applicability to both "wired" and "wireless" designs. The model of the light absorber handles electron and hole transport. The model of the electrolyte accounts for mass transport through regions of aqueous solution, including stagnant diffusion layers and bulk regions to address mixing due to bubbles, natural convection, or other sources. A polymer membrane may be present in the electrolyte. The models of the light absorber and the electrolyte are integrated through the reactions taking place at the interface between them. Charge transfer from the semiconductor to the solution is handled using a kinetic model involving reactions between the,species in both the light absorber and the electrolyte. A simplified model is also presented for use when concentration gradients in the electrolyte are negligible. The simplified model captures the effect of the electrolyte in the boundary conditions for the light absorber. The model is validated against current-potential data for a hydrogen-evolving light absorber with varying degrees of simulated solar illumination. The model then shows how overall solar-to-hydrogen yield depends on the efficiency of the light absorber and the areal fraction of absorbers in a membrane separator.

J	Dau, H; Haumann, M				MIchael, Haumann/A-7087-2013	Dau, Holger/0000-0001-6482-7494			Considerations on the mechanism of photosynthetic water oxidation - dual role of oxo-bridges between Mn ions in (i) redox-potential maintenance and (ii) proton abstraction from substrate water								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				84	1-3			325	331		10.1007/s11120-004-7080-2				JUN 2005	2005	Two mechanistic problems of photosynthetic water oxidation at the Mn complex of Photosystem II (PS II) are considered. (I) In the four Mn-oxidizing transitions, any pure Mn oxidation is predicted to cause an increase in redox potential that renders subsequent oxidation steps impossible (redox-potential problem). Formation of unprotonated oxo-bridges may counteract the potential increase. (II) The O-O formation step without any high-pK bases acting as proton acceptors is energetically unfavorable (acceptor-base problem). The pK of oxides in a bridging position between Mn ions may increase drastically upon reduction of Mn in the water-oxidation step (>10 units), thus rendering them favorable proton acceptors. It is proposed that in PS II, in the course of the four oxidizing transitions at least two unprotonated oxo-bridges are formed. Thereby (i) a redox potential increase is prevented and (ii) proton acceptors are prepared for the O-O formation step. Water oxidation in the O-O bond formation step is facilitated by simultaneous Mn reduction and proton transfer to bridging oxides amounting to hydrogen atom or hydride transfer from substrate water to the Mn-oxo core of the Mn complex of PS II.

Transmission electron microscopy images revealed that Ag particles with diameters of 10-20 nm were evenly deposited on the CNF. The Ag/CNF Schottky-type composites exhibited strong photocatalytic activity for tetracycline (TC) degradation upon irradiation with visible light. The rate constant for TC degradation was enhanced approximately 23.56 and 2.97 times in the presence of the 1.2%-Ag/CNF composite as compared with bulk g-C3N4 and CNF, respectively. In addition, the Ag-CNF Schottky-type composites promoted hydrogen evolution. Free radical trap experiments and electron spin resonance results revealed that holes (h(+)) and superoxide radicals (center dot O-2(-)) were the major active species during the photocatalytic degradation. The improved photocatalytic performance was attributable to the surface plasmon resonance of Ag and the effective separation of the photogenerated charges due to the construction of Schottky junctions between Ag and the semiconductors. This work might provide a basis for the construction of carbon nitride-based Schottky-type heterojunctions for hydrogen evolution and elimination of TC from the environment.									21	3	0	0	3	0	21			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000472183900010

Inspired by the strategies in natural photosynthesis, researchers have developed a number of homogeneous molecular systems for photocatalytic, photoelectrocatalytic, and electrocatalytic artificial photosynthesis. However, their photochemical instability in homogeneous solution are hurdles for scaled application in real life. Immobilization of molecular catalysts in solid supports support provides a fine blueprint to tackle this issue. This review highlights the recent developments in (i) techniques for immobilizing molecular catalysts in solid supports and (ii) catalytic water splitting, CO2 reduction, and O-2 reduction with the support-immobilized molecular catalysts. Remaining challenges for molecular catalyst-based devices for artificial photosynthesis are discussed in the end of this review.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2196-5404			WOS:000594783400001	33252707

Therefore, comparing to the active fuel cells, the volumetric energy density is improved. In this work, ethylene glycol in alkaline solution is employed as fuel in this fuel cell, while hydrogen peroxide in acid solution is employed as oxidant, and a cation exchange membrane is employed to transport cations. The theoretical voltage of this type of fuel cell is as high as 2.47 V, which exhibits a promising potential in practical applications. The operating conditions can influence the performance of this fuel cell system, including species concentrations in both fuel and oxidant, thicknesses of membranes, and operating temperatures. In addition, the open-circuit voltage and the peak power density of this fuel cell are as high as 1.58 V and 65.8 mW cm(-2) at 60 degrees C, respectively. Comparing to a fuel cell system with a similar setting but using oxygen as oxidant, the higher voltage output and power output are attributed to the easier and faster reduction reaction of hydrogen peroxide, which makes contributions to the impressive performance improvement of this fuel cell. Moreover, the effect of the released heat caused by the hydrogen peroxide self-decomposition to the cell performance is studied as well.									37	1	0	0	2	0	37			0306-2619	1872-9118		WOS:000482244000067

The nanoporous structure and chemical composition of the catalysts distribute uniformly. Based on the electrochemical active area (EASA), electrocatalytic activity and stability, the np-CuO/TiO2/Pd-NiO-3 catalyst possesses the best performance for methanol and ethanol electro-oxidation. For methanol and ethanol electro-oxidation, the anodic current densities in forward scan of the np-CuO/TiO2/Pd-NiO-3 catalyst are about 5.6 times and 2.1 times larger than that of the np-CuO/TiO2/Pd catalyst, respectively. The introduction of NiO provides more electrochemical active sites due to the improved geometrical and bifunctional mechanism. NiO promotes the adsorption of oxygen-containing species (OHads) on the catalyst surface, and electron effect between Pd and Ni is favorable for charge transfer. This accelerates the removal of intermediate products during the oxidation process. The electrocatalytic processes of methanol and ethanol oxidation in alkaline solution are controlled by both charge transfer and diffusion. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, it always faces several restrictions including severe photocorrosion, low charge separation and transfer efficiencies, poor visible light harvesting, and sluggish interfacial reaction kinetics, which often required a variety of modifications with only low improvements achieved. Herein, a high performance CQDs/TiO2/WO3 photoanode was designed on the basis of density function theory (DFT) alignment of lattice parameters and energy band, and charge distribution. The TiO2/WO3 heterojunction can abate photocorrosion through the hetero-epitaxial growth of TiO2 (001) on WO3 (002) for the lattice mismatch <3% eliminating dangling bonds, with high corrosion resistance and photostability of TiO2. As the built-in field constructed by a staggered band alignment structure with the valence band offset (VBO) of 0.51 eV, the photogenerated carriers transfer and separation are promoted dramatically. Through the DFT calculations, the sunlight absorption wavelength can be extended, and the interfacial reaction kinetics can be expedited with the modification of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) on TiO2/WO3, due to the narrower bandgap (Eg) and the accumulation of electrons at TiO2 side. The DFT designed CQDs/TiO2/WO3 photoanode significantly increase photocurrent density from 0.90 to 2.03 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V, charge separation efficiency from 56.3 to 79.2% and charge injection efficiency from 51.2 to 70.4%, and extend light absorption edge from 455 to 463 nm over pristine WO3, with better photostability and lower holes-to-water resistance.

Previously, residual dipolar couplings measured for backbone amide H-1-N-15 correlations in both substrate-free and bound forms of CYP101A1 were used as restraints in soft annealing molecular dynamic simulations in order to identify average conformations of the enzyme with and without substrate bound. Multiple substrate-dependent conformational changes remote from the enzyme active site were identified, and site-directed mutagenesis and activity assays confirmed the importance of these changes in substrate recognition. The current work makes use of perturbation response scanning (PRS) and umbrella sampling molecular dynamic of the residual dipolar coupling-derived CYP101A1 structures to probe the roles of remote structural features in enforcing the regio- and stereospecific nature of the hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by CYP101A1. An improper dihedral angle 4) was defined and used to maintain substrate orientation in the CYP101A1 active site, and it was observed that different values of LP result in different PRS response maps. Umbrella sampling methods show that the free energy of the system is sensitive to LP, and bound substrate forms an important mechanical link in the transmission of mechanical coupling through the enzyme structure. Finally, a qualitative approach to interpreting PRS maps in terms of the roles of secondary structural features is proposed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The composition and structure of the obtained new magnetically recyclable ternary nanocomposites were completely characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area analysis, vibrating sample magnetometery (VSM), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This novel magnetically recyclable heterogeneous fullerene-modified catalyst was tested for the H2O2-assisted photocatalytic degradation of MB dye under visible light. The results show that about 95% of the MB (25 mg L-1, 50 ml) was degraded by the Ag3PO4/Fe3O4/C-60 nanocomposite within 5 h under visible light irradiation. The catalytic performance of the Ag3PO4/Fe3O4/C-60 nanocomposite was then examined for 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) reduction using NaBH4. This new nanocomposite showed that 4-NP was reduced to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) in 98% yield with an aqueous solution of NaBH4. In both photocatalytic and catalytic reactions, the Ag3PO4/Fe3O4/C-60 nanocomposite exhibited higher catalytic activity than pure Ag3PO4. Moreover, the Ag3PO4/Fe3O4/C-60 nanocomposite could be magnetically separated from the reaction mixture and reused without any change in structure. The antibacterial activity of the nanocomposites was also investigated and they showed good antibacterial activity against a few human pathogenic bacteria.									17	1	0	0	1	0	17			2046-2069			WOS:000430451800063	35540839

The electronic structures of the isolated metal centers can greatly influence the adsorption energies of reactants and intermediates, thus determining the catalytic activities of SACs. Especially, the electronic structure regulation of the metal sites has been advanced to the atomic level and proven a powerful strategy to enhance their electrocatalytic performances, which provides great opportunities for the further development of SACs. Based on the reported synthesis and structural modulation methods, in this review, the experimental and computational advances in the electronic structure regulation strategies for SACs, including coordination adjustment, electronic metal-support interaction, oxidation state modulation, and strain engineering, will be summarized. Then, the effects of electronic structures on the adsorption behaviors and, thus, the electrocatalytic activities of water splitting and O-2/CO2 reduction reactions will be emphatically exemplified and discussed. In the end, a brief conclusion of this paper and the existing challenges and future opportunities in this research direction will be proposed. This review aims to highlight the understanding of electronic structure in association to the electrocatalytic activity for SACs and provide guidance for their further development in electrochemical applications.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1931-9401			WOS:000661615800001		
J	Du, Xiaoqiang; Huang, Chenrong; Zhang, Xiaoshuang								Co3O4 arrays with tailored morphology as robust water oxidation and urea splitting catalyst								JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS				809						151821	10.1016/j.jallcom.2019.151821				NOV 15 2019	2019	A typical hydrothermal preparation approach was successfully exploited and designed for the in situ growth of highly ordered Co3O4 nanostructure precursors on a Ni foam substrates, a series of Co3O4 nanoarray-based electrocatalysts was obtained via a subsequent calcination procedure. The formation of Co3O4 hierarchical structures with different morphologies depended upon the hydrothermal time, which was used to further reveal the growth mechanism of the Co3O4 nanostructures. H2O and CO(NH2)(2) were selected as probe molecules to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity over the resulting Co-based electrocatalysts, and the influence of the morphology on the electrocatalytic performance was further investigated via employing different hydrothermal times. It is worth noting that Co3O4/NF-11h nanosheets@ nanoneedles heterostructures with a low density of nanosheets presents superior electrocatalytic performance and long-term durability owing to an increased exposure to active sites in the hierarchical nanostructure. The Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations results show that H2O molecules are preferentially adsorbed at the top of the Co3O4 (111) crystal surface. This work emphasizes the significance of effective structure design for the development of robust and precious metal-free electrocatalysts via the precise control of catalyst morphology.

Samples with a Ni/13X mass ratio within the range 0.2-1.0 were synthesized. Modification by both Ni and NiO clusters, depending on whether the atmosphere was reducing (H-2) or oxidizing (air), respectively, was used to finish the sample. After modification, the zeolite kept its original crystallographic structure, as proven by X-ray diffractommetry. The dimensions of the incorporated clusters were limited by the diameter of the zeolite cavities (reaching1.3 nm). This material, homogenized with 10 wt% of nanodispersed carbon, was bonded in the form of a thin layer to a glassy carbon disc by means of Nafion and used as an electrode material in an aqueous 0.1 M NaOH solution. The cyclovoltammograms of this thin-layer electrode resemble those of a smooth nickel electrode in alkaline solutions.					8th International Conference on Fundamental and Applied Aspects of Physical Chemistry8th International Conference on Fundamental and Applied Aspects of Physical Chemistry	SEP 26-29, 2006SEP 26-29, 2006		Belgrade, SERBIABelgrade, SERBIA	12	0	0	0	1	0	12			0036-0244	1531-863X		WOS:000253706400020

Degenerate PCR primers were designed from the available data base deposited in the GenBank. Applying these primers to cDNA prepared from isolated and purified total RNA from Arabian camel liver led to the generation of two PCR products corresponding to 969 and 477 bp. These PCR products were cloned on pGEM-T-Easy cloning vector separately. Sequencing of the PCR generated cDNA fragments indicated that the 969 bp fragment represents partial coding sequence of camel G6PD and showed 93, 91 and 86% similarity with the Homo sapiens, Bos taurus and Rattus norvegicus G6PD, respectively. The Camelus dromedaries G6PD partial coding sequence encodes an open reading frame of a truncated protein consists of 323 amino acid residues that showed the conserved substrate binding site and the dinuclotide-binding fingerprint.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1684-5315			WOS:000294668500003

MnO2 featuring 2D delta-phase layered structure was intimately attached onto the surface of g-C3N4 layers via -C-O- bonding. Notably, the synthesized MnO2/g-C3N4 photocatalyst showed substantially enhanced photocatalytic activity in the reduction of CO2 than pure g-C3N4 and MnO2. The highest CO production amount of 9.6 mu mol g(-1) has been obtained at an optimized loading amount of MnO2 under 1 h irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp. The incorporation of narrow band gap MnO2 on the surface of g-C3N4 enhanced its light harvesting ability. And the solid hetero-interface between MnO2 and g-C3N4 together with their well matched band structure was favorable for the separation of photo-induced carriers, consequently enhanced its photocatalytic activity. This novel 2D-2D MnO2/g-C3N4 heterostructure is expected to have great potentials in CO2 photoreduction. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Generally, PTL serves to transfer the chemical species required for chemical reactions to the active site. In this study, we prepare a bifunctional catalytic metal-foam porous transport layer (CMPTL) that can serve as an electrochemical catalyst as well as mass transfer. A CMPTL consists of nanostructured NiSe2 directly synthesized on Ni foam with a porous 3D structure by hydrothermal synthesis, and NiSe2 provides catalytic activity for the OER and HER. As a result of evaluating the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) of the CMPTL using three electrode systems, the total overpotential of CMPTL is reduced by about 30.8% compared to commercial PTL (Ni foam). In addition, the energy density of LABs with CMPTL increases by 16.7% at a current density of 200 mu A cm(-2), and the current density of PEMWE with CMPTL increases by 23.5 times at 1.9 V.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000790737100002

Herein, commercial CNTs serving as conductive kernels are in situ coupled with 3D ZIF-67 derived Co/CoP core-corona clusters. Such a hierarchical bead string nanostructure not only possesses highly exposed active sites, but also favours fast electron transfer for electrocatalytic kinetics. Our material shows excellent HER (eta(10) = -151 mV) and glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) performance, showing a smaller hybrid water splitting potential of 1.42 V compared to conventional water splitting (eta(10) = 1.74 V) for H-2 production. DFT calculations indicate that the Schottky heterointerface at Co/CoP decreases the initial H2O dissociation energy barrier and possesses a thermoneutral H* adsorption free energy for the HER, as well as reducing the energy barrier for the GOR. Meanwhile, more oxidative cobalt oxyhydroxide favoured the GOR process. The present work opens a new avenue for designing Mott-Schottky multifunctional electrocatalysts for both energy-saving H-2 production and value-added products.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000642226100001

Fine Ta 0.02-10 mu m particles of bimodal size distribution with average volume maxima of 0.12 and 4 mu m were prepared via electric explosion of thin Ta wire in Ar atmosphere. The oxidation reaction proceeded via several intermediate suboxides (Ta6O, Ta4O, Ta2O and TaO2) in which chemical and structure transformations caused multistep kinetics of the oxidation process in a narrow temperature interval of 250-570 degrees C. Within the interval of 250-400 degrees C, the oxidation process occurred under diffusion control with an apparent activation energy E-a,E-1 = 31.6 +/- 1.2 kJ/mol and the main oxidation products were Ta(O) solid solutions and suboxides Ta6O and Ta4O. In the interval of 400-520 degrees C, oxidation was accompanied by a low-barrier martensite-like transformation of the lower suboxides resulting in reducing of diffusion limitations of the process (E-a,E-2 = 4.8 +/- 1.2 kJ/mol). In the interval of 520-570 degrees C, oxidation of the larger Ta particles was completed to form Ta2O (E-a,E-3 = 64.7 +/- 1.9 kJ/mol). An abrupt decay of Ta2O at temperatures greater than ~ 570 degrees C induced the high-rate oxidation of micron-sized Ta particles, resulting in self-heating of the sample.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of TiCl3 or Ti colloid doped samples indicates that Ti species do not remain on the sample surface but are driven into the material with increasing milling time. The surface concentration of Ti continues to decrease during subsequent cycles under hydrogen. After several cycles, it reaches a constant value of 0.5 at. % independently of the nature of the precursor. Moreover, metallic aluminum is already present at the surface after 2 min of ball milling in the case of TiCl3 doped Na-alanate, whereas it is totally absent in the case of Ti colloid doped samples at any milling time. Upon cycling, the atomic concentration of metallic Al at the surface evolves with the reaction under hydrogen, in contrast to the Ti concentration. Analysis of the binding energies of samples doped with TiCl3 or Ti colloid, after eight desorption/absorption cycles, reveals that the Na, O, and Ti environment remains the same, while the Al environment undergoes changes. According to the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis of TiCl3 doped Na-alanate, the local structure around Ti during the first cycle is close to that of metallic Ti but in a more distorted state. In the case of the Ti colloid doped sample, a stripping of the oxygen shell occurs. After eight cycles, a similar intermetallic phase between Ti and Al is present in the hydrogenated state of TiCl3 or Ti colloid doped samples. The local structure around Ti atoms after eight cycles consists of Al and Ti backscatterers with a Ti-Al distance of 2.79 angstrom and a Ti-Ti distance of 3.88 angstrom. This local structure is not exactly the TiAl3 phase because it differs significantly from the alloy phase in its fine structure and lacks long-range order. Volumetric measurements performed on these samples indicate that the formation of this local structure is responsible for the reduction of the reversible hydrogen capacity with the increasing number of cycles. Moreover, the formation of the alloy-like phase is correlated with a decrease of the desorption/absorption reaction rate.									61	1	0	0	0	0	62			1520-6106			WOS:000235046300018	16471663

Hydrochemical study shows that these waters present a spatial variability of chemical facies which is linked to the lithology of the host rock. The factors contributing to the mineralization are mainly the water-rock interaction in particular the dissolution of evaporitic minerals and the cation exchange reactions. Stable isotopes show an enrichment in delta O-18 and delta H-2 contents principally for piezometric levels closest to the surface, reflecting measures found in the current rainfall subject to a semi-arid to arid context. These results are coherent with those of C-14 and H-3 that allow the qualitative identification of a current recharge which could probably be supplied by the recent infiltration of waters in Wadis and by the direct infiltration of meteoric water through the local sandstone outcrops of the basin. This concerns in particular the well of Salem ben Salem Dabbabi, showing a content of 1.03 TU, and its static level is controlled by the Tataouine Wadi, indicating therefore an evident sign of recent recharge.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			1866-6280	1866-6299		WOS:000381986800034

Here, we report the controlled synthesis of flower-like CoPO microsheet arrays supported on Ni foam (CoPO MA/NF) via a simple hydrothermal reaction, and their direct use as a 3D integrated anode for non-enzymatic glucose sensing. The catalytic activity of CoPO MA/NF towards glucose oxidation was evaluated by electrochemical tests. Results show that CoPO MA/NF displays high performance for glucose sensing with a short response time of less than 10 s, a low detection limit of 1 mu M (S/N = 3), and a high sensitivity of 3.55 mA mM(-1) cm(-2). In addition, CoPO MA/NF shows excellent selectivity in the presence of interfering agents such as dopamine, uric acid and ascorbic acid, which makes it reliable for glucose detection in real human serum samples. This work not only provides the controlled synthesis of a CoPO 3D integrated electrode by a simple process, but also explores the potential application of the CoPO-based electrode material for electrochemical sensing of biochemical analytes.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2052-1553			WOS:000503509100006

This NiFeOxHy film has a current density of 10mAcm(-2) with an overpotential () of only 298mV at nanomolar concentration and the current density of 10mAcm(-2) remains constant over 22h in 1m KOH. The extremely high turnover frequency of 0.51s(-1) was obtained with of 300mV. More importantly, such outstanding activity and transparency (optical loss <0.5%) of the NiFeOxHy film are attributed to a ligand effect of the dodecyl substituent in Ni-C-12, which enables its future application in solar water splitting.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000417561000002	29057622

Electrochemical Splitting of Calcium Carbonate to Increase Solution Alkalinity: Implications for Mitigation of Carbon Dioxide and Ocean Acidity								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				42	23			8935	8940		10.1021/es800366q				DEC 1 2008	2008	Electrochemical splitting of calcium carbonate (e.g., as contained in limestone or other minerals) is explored as a means of forming dissolve hydroxides for absorbing, neutralizing, and storing carbon dioxide, and for restoring, preserving, or enhancing ocean calcification. While essentially insoluble in water, CaCO3 can be dissolved in the presence of the highly acidic anolyte of a water electrolysis cell. The resulting charged constituents, Ca2+ and CO32-, migrate to the cathode and anode, respectively, forming Ca(OH)(2) on the one hand and H2CO3 (or H2O and CO2) on the other. By maintaining a pH between 6 and 9, subsequent hydroxide reactions with CO2 primarily produce dissolved calcium bicarbonate, Ca(HCO3)(2aq). Thus, for each mole of CaCO3 split, there can be a net capture of up to 1 mol of CO2. Ca(HCO3)(2aq) is thus the carbon sequestrant that can be diluted and stored in the ocean, in natural or artificial surface water reservoirs, or underground. The theoretical work requirement for the reaction is 266 kJ(e) per net mole CO2 consumed. Even with inefficiencies, a realized net energy expenditure lower than the preceding quantity appears possible considering energy recovery via oxidation of the H-2 produced. The net process cost is estimated to be <$100/tonne CO2 mitigated. An experimental demonstration of the concept is presented, and further implementation issues are discussed.									64	1	0	0	17	0	69			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000261307200055	19192821

Here, we have fabricated a covalently linked gold nanoprism-cobalt molecular catalyst construct that stimulated efficient photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation reaction. This assembly generated significant photocurrent (similar to 50 mu A/cm(2)) in neutral aqueous conditions with a minimal onset overpotential (similar to 250 mV). This dyad imitates the light-harvesting properties of natural photosystem-II by producing 0.66 mu moles of O-2 and 1.32 mu moles of H-2 simultaneously per hour (0.8% photon to chemical fuel conversion efficiency) following complete water splitting under light with similar to 0.075-0.01% incident photon to photocurrent conversion efficiency (IPCE). The presence of the plasmonic gold nanomaterial in this assembly instigates broad-band absorbance spanning from the visible to NIR region (400-1200 nm) covering the majority of the natural solar spectrum. This dyad construct also exhibited appreciable durability under photoelectrocatalytic conditions to demonstrate its prospective applications in alternative energy fields.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			2380-8195			WOS:000490365500010

In the present study, the electrochemical activity of an IrOx-Ta2O5/Ti anode was enhanced via radiofrequency (RF)-driven rapid plasma annealing (RPA) process; a 2.0 MHz plasma jet was applied to the surface of the precursor-brushed IrOx-Ta2O5/Ti anode, changing the surface morphology and electrochemical characteristics of its coating. The final surface morphology, resulting from the subsequent calcination, exhibited a spongy-like microstructure and much smaller cracks compared with the coatings treated with the conventional thermal decomposition (CTD) process. Moreover, the RPA-treated samples showed lower overpotential (j = 10 mA/cm(2)) of 261 mV (vs. RHE) and higher voltammetric charges (330.26 mC/cm(2)). Compared with the CTD-treated one, the electrochemical activity of the RPA-treated samples was greatly improved with a comparable stability after additional calcination at 480 degrees C. This enhancement in the electrochemical performance indicates that an RF plasma jet, as an RPA tool, has a great potential for improving the catalytic activity of IrOx-Ta2O5/Ti anodes.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0257-8972	1879-3347		WOS:000540175000008

In the present work, the electronic structure, carrier separation efficiency, band edges position, and optical property of g-C3N4 catalyst modified by five-membered heterocyclic small molecules as a ligand (thiophene, furan, pyrrole, or pyrryl) have been investigated by means of the Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The results show that the carrier migration and separation efficiency as well as the utilization of visible light were enhanced after all four types of modifications. However, considering the relationship of overpotential of water redox reaction over g-C3N4 and band edge positions with respect to the water redox potentials, only adsorbing pyrrole can meet the requirements of the over-potential of the photoelectrochemical (PEC) splitting of water to generate H-2 and O-2. Due to the more activating n-pi* electrons transitions in the distorted configurations, the optical absorption curves of the surface modified g-C3N4 systems are all red-shifted, while only the pyrrole modified system has two impurity energy levels, which indicates the rapid electron transit. Based on the above analysis, we propose that pyrrole should be an excellent ligand for the modification of g-C3N4 to improve the photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000461150400014

Nevertheless, it remains unknown whether this enhancement is due to a bifunctional mechanism involving Pt and Ru as active sites or an electronic effect of Ru on Pt. In this study, we distinguish between those fundamental differences using Ru@Pt core-shell nanoparticles as a model system. Ru@Pt catalysts were prepared from submonolayer to multilayer Pt coverage. The exposure of Ru on the surface of the catalyst was analyzed by cyclic voltammetry, showing that Ru is solely exposed on the surface of Ru@Pt particles with low Pt-coverage. The thickness of the Pt-shell was characterized by CO stripping in H2SO4, allowing to distinguish between single and bilayered Ru@Pt catalysts. Determining the HOR/HER activity of these catalysts in 0.1 M NaOH revealed that fully Pt-covered Ru is more active than partially covered Ru@Pt nanoparticles. Hence, the participation of Ru as active site in a bifunctional mechanism is of minor importance with respect to the HOR/HER activity compared to its influence on the electronic structure of Pt. Similar to Pt-Ru alloys, the most active Ru@Pt core-shell nanoparticles show a 4 to 5-fold enhancement of the surface-normalized HOR/HER activity compared to Pt/C. (C) The Author(s) 2018.

Earlier studies of these flames have focused on the downstream regions where soot has already developed. Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and elastic scattering measurements from 266 nm excitation are combined with laser-induced incandescence (LII) excited at 1064 nm. The structure and evolution of the soot precursor particles are characterised using the LIF intensity, decay time and the relative spectral emission in the ultraviolet and visible. The LIF decay times indicate that the majority of 266 nm excited LIF originates from nanostructures rather than gas phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). A similarity in the particle evolution for the low and high sooting flames in the upstream regions is found, indicating a general transition towards larger structures with more aromatic features as the nanostructures advect downstream in the fuel rich pyrolytic conditions. Higher nanostructure concentrations are found to precede the higher soot volume fractions (SVF) found in fuel rich sootier flames, although not proportionally, suggesting that surface growth strongly contributes to SVF in the high sooting flames. In the heavier sooting flames the majority of particle formation shifts from the centreline to the wings at the outer edges of the flame closer to stoichiometry. Particle formation in the wings of the flames occurs in the presence of oxygen and higher temperatures, resulting in particles with spectroscopic properties resembling those formed toward the oxidiser side of counter-flow diffusion flames. In the heavier sooting flames, particles produced in the wings appear to mix with particles formed along the centreline of the flame at the flame tip, resulting in a broad range of nanostructures and soot occurring in this region.

Stable reduced silver @ titanium carbide @ cuprous oxide (Ag@Ti3C2@Cu2O) nanocomposites with efficient antibacterial activities were synthesized via a simple wet chemical method at room temperature and developed as highly efficient photocatalytic bactericides for antifouling. The Ag@Ti3C2@Cu2O nanocomposites showed excellent antibacterial activities against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. The electron-hole recombination efficiency of the nanocomposites was analyzed by characterizing the photoluminescence spectra, which indicated that the charge transfer channel imparted by the heterostructure between the nanocomposites considerably improved charge transport and separation efficiency, prolonged the life of active electrons, and promoted the generation of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations and finite element method calculations indicated that the structure of nanocomposites reduces the difficulty of photoelectron escaping during photocatalysis and improves photocatalytic efficiency.									54	3	0	0	7	0	54			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000517665200025

In this work, we utilized the piezoelectric-like behavior of BiOBr to suppress the recombination of photo-excited charges. Under the excitation of the piezo-vibration and the irradiation using a 9W white LED, the BiOBr catalyst shows a high reaction rate for catalytically decomposing organic dyes, which is 5.62 and 11.0 times of those from the individual photocatalysis and piezocatalysis, respectively. This catalyst has high structural stability and can be recycled for reuse, as well as presents good activity for degrading different organic pollutants via the synergetic photocatalysis/piezocatalysis process. On the basis of the piezoelectric-like effect and our experimental results, a possible catalytic mechanism has been proposed considering the separation of photo-induced charges and the formation of highly active radicals. This work associates photocatalysis with piezoelectric-like effect for improving the catalytic performance of BiOBr, hopefully providing a new and efficient approach not only for wastewater treatment, but also for other catalytic applications.

The physical and chemical properties of the Pt-Ba-Ce/gamma-Al2O3 catalysts were studied using a combination of characterization techniques, which showed that PtOx, CeO2, and BaCO3, whose peaks were observed in X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra, dispersed well on the gamma-Al2O3, as shown by transmission electron microscope (TEM), and that the difference between Ce3+ and Ce4+, as detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), facilitated the migration of active oxygen over the catalyst. In the process of a complete NSR experiment, the NOx storage capability was greatly enhanced in the temperature range of 250-350 degrees C, and reached a maximum value of 315.3 mu mol.g(cat)(1) at 350 degrees C, which was ascribed to the increase in NO2 yield. In a lean and rich cycling experiment, the results showed that NOx storage efficiency and conversion were increased when the time of H-2 exposure (i.e., 30, 45, and 60 s) was extended. The maximum NOx conversion of the catalyst reached 83.5% when the duration of the lean and rich phases was 240 and 60 s, respectively. The results revealed that increasing the content of H-2 by an appropriate amount was favorable to the NSR mechanism due to increased decomposition of nitrate or nitrite, and the refreshing of trapping sites for the next cycle of NSR.

Herein, we have successfully con-structed sheet-like CoMoO4-Co(OH)(2) and CoMoP-CoP arrays on nickel foam (NF) through chemical etching ZIF-67 arrays and phosphorization in sequence. Series CoMoO4-Co(OH)(2)/ NF as anode and CoMoP-CoP/NF as cathode showed excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability in alkali water splitting, where the combined catalysts only need 1.67 V cell voltage to drive 10 mA cm(-2) and obtain robust high current stability at 500 mA cm(-2) for 110 h with almost no attenuation. In addition, using CoMoP-CoP/NF as the cathode of a Zn-H2O cell can provide a power density of 11.5 mW cm(-2) and a stable 170 h for simultaneous H-2 and electricity generation. The excellent performance of the system is attributed to the unique sheet-like array morphology of combined catalysts providing large surface area and rich pore structure conducive to electrolyte diffusion and gas emission, as well as the synergies between the different components providing more catalytic active sites.

As an example of the development of a photoredox catalyst system for organic synthesis, visible-light driven selective pyruvate reduction to lactate (a raw material for biodegradable polymers) with a system of triethanolamine (TEOA), zinc tetraphenylporphyrin tetrasulfonate (ZnTPPS), methylviologen (MV2+) and colloidal platinum nanoparticles dispersed by polyvinylpyrrolidone (Pt-PVP) has been reported previously. In this work, the improvement of visible-light driven selective lactate synthesis with this system was attempted by tuning an electron mediator or controlling the pH. The radical cation species is expected to be more effective in reducing pyruvate to lactate than hydride species in this system. From the result of the pH controlling experiment, it was found that the protonated TEOA (TEOAH(+)) is strongly involved in the pyruvate reduction to lactate with this system under steady-state irradiation. Moreover, racemic lactate was synthesized and no enantioselectivity was observed in this system.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2398-4902			WOS:000712537900001

In present work, twenty genes were identified in Nicotiana tabacum Rboh family (NtabRboh) and classified into four phylogenetic groups (I-IV). Fourteen NtabRboh genes were positioned on ten chromosomes (i.e., Ch1, 2, 4, 7-11, 14 and 21), and six scaffolds. Synteny and evolutionary analysis showed that most of the NtabRboh genes have evolved from the genomes of the ancestor species (N. tomentosiformis and N. sylvestris), which afterwards expanded through duplication events. The promoter regions of the NtabRboh genes contained numerous cis-acting regulatory elements for hormones, plant growth, and different biotic and abiotic factors. The NtabRbohF gene transcript comprised target sites for wounding and stress responsive microRNAs: nta-miR166a-d, g and h. The transcript abundance of NtabRboh genes in different tissues reflected their important for plant growth and organ development in tobacco. RT-qPCR-assays demonstrated that the expression of NtabRboh genes are regulated by viral and bacterial pathogens, drought, cold and cadmium stress. The expression levels NtabRbohA, B and C were significantly up-regulated in "black shank and tobacco mosaic virus-inoculated susceptible and transgenic tobacco cultivars, showing that these genes play important roles in disease resistance.									12	1	0	0	9	0	13			0888-7543	1089-8646		WOS:000514071600040	31430516

Herein, a class of anion-vacancy and cation-substitution proof-of-concept atomically thin CoSe2 subnanometer belts (SBs) are reported to greatly boost the electrooxidation of butylamine into high-value-added butyronitrile coupled with hydrogen generation. The as-fabricated CoSe2 SBs with Se vacancies and Ni substitutions (CoSe2/Ni-SVs SBs) exhibit an ultralow onset potential of 1.3 V with up to a similar to 98.5% butyronitrile Faradaic efficiency, which surpasses all the reported Co- and Ni-based catalysts. In situ electrochemical FTIR and EIS spectroscopy studies indicate that the dramatically enhanced electrooxidation performance can be attributed to the optimized adsorption behavior and accelerated dehydrogenation kinetics. Theoretical studies further reveal that Se vacancies can act as strong Lewis acid sites to effectively strengthen the adsorption of N atoms, whereas Ni substitutions are responsible for improving the dehydrogenation thermodynamics by optimizing the sequence of dehydrogenation steps. We further demonstrate that the CoSe2/Ni-SVs SBs are highly general and efficient catalysts for the electrosynthesis of propylamine, benzylamine, and cyclohexane methylamine into nitriles coupled with hydrogen generation. More importantly, a CoSe2/Ni-SVs SB-based two-electrode electrolyzer that uses amine oxidation at the anode can achieve a voltage of 1.37 V at a current density of 10 mA cm-2, which can lower the cell voltage by even 320 mV compared to that of a conventional two-electrode electrolyzer that uses the oxygen evolution reaction at the anode.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000862131900001

GDC powder was prepared by solvent deficient method and sintered at 1650 degrees C for 10 h to achieve dense ceramics with -8 mu m grain size. The densified GDC samples were subsequently annealed using a 60 W infrared laser at over 2100 degrees C for 1 h under a thermal gradient equivalent to -0.3-0.5 degrees C/mu m. The postannealed samples at 2150 degrees C for 1 h exhibit grains with average length and width of 37 and 28 mu m, respectively. Electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) analysis revealed that the post-annealed sample at 2150 degrees C consists of grains oriented close to five principal directions ( 4 3 10 0 0 1 13 1 14 7 6 20 7 2 7 on [0 1 0]) within a tolerance angle of +/- 10 degrees, whereas the grains of the pre-annealed sample are randomly oriented. Gadolinium diffuses 20-30 mu m away from the irradiated surface, with the measured composition of regions deeper than 30 mu m, Ce0.86Gd0.14O1.93, is close to that of the pre-annealed sample, Ce0.87Gd0.13O1.94. Enhancement of total conductivity of the post-annealed GDC (1.1 x 10-3 S cm-1 at 500 degrees C, and 2.1 x 10-2 S cm-1 at 700 degrees C) is observed when compared to the pre-annealed GDC (3.1 x 10-5 S cm-1 at 500 degrees C, and 1.7 x 10-3 S cm-1 at 700 degrees C), and points to the decrease in the grain boundary (GB) resistivity. This could be attributed to both the change in GB area and grain alignment.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000689712300001

Hybrids of layered double hydroxide (LDH) exhibit excellent photocatalytic properties for use in the field of wastewater treatment due to the large interlayer spaces, chemical stability, and low cost. However, pristine LDH suffers from numerous limitations, such as insufficient visible light utilization and a high recombination rate of electron-hole pairs, resulting in degradation of photocatalytic performance. Recent advancements have demonstrated that LDH-based hybrids are suitable nanocomposites for photocatalytic applications when combining LDH with other semiconductors. This article summarizes the progress in the field of LDH-based ternary composites with emphasis on the removal of organic pollutants and heavy metal ions from aqueous media. Moreover, the applications and synthesis of LDH-based ternary composites, including corresponding examples, are discussed. In addition, the interaction mechanisms between photocatalysts and contaminants in water are comprehensively explained. Finally, the review provides insights into the challenges and prospects for the advancement of LDH-based photocatalysts.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			2191-9089	2191-9097		WOS:000611021600001

The SnNb2O6/CoFe-LDH heterostructures displayed distinctly enhanced photocatalytic ability toward Methyl orange (MO), which was about 1.1 and 1.2 times higher than that of SnNb2O6 and CoFe-LDH, respectively. It is believed that the improved photocatalytic performance was mainly due to the unique energy band structure of heterostructures, which facilitated the efficient separation and transfer of photoinduced carriers and enhanced light harvesting. Moreover, the obtained photocatalyst exhibited high magnetic response under an external magnetic field, which was beneficial to the recovery of SnNb2O6/CoFe-LDH from aqueous solution. The successful fabrication of a visible-light-driven magnetic 2D/2D heterostructure photocatalyst is a significant contribution to wastewater treatment.									11	2	0	0	1	0	12			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000447384700011

Here we report the catalytic ability of polyacrylonitrile-based heteroatomic carbon nanofibres for carbon dioxide reduction into carbon monoxide, via a metal-free, renewable and cost-effective route. The carbon nanofibre catalyst exhibits negligible overpotential (0.17 V) for carbon dioxide reduction and more than an order of magnitude higher current density compared with the silver catalyst under similar experimental conditions. The carbon dioxide reduction ability of carbon nanofibres is attributed to the reduced carbons rather than to electronegative nitrogen atoms. The superior performance is credited to the nanofibrillar structure and high binding energy of key intermediates to the carbon nanofibre surfaces. The finding may lead to a new generation of metal-free and non-precious catalysts with much greater efficiency than the existing noble metal catalysts.									513	36	0	0	40	0	523			2041-1723			WOS:000329393000001

In the absence of carbonate and, consequently, of relative carbon- and oxygen-isotopic data, the elemental geochemistry revealed to be a very useful tool to obtain information about the palaeoclimatic and palaeoceanographic evolution of the Tethys Ocean during the OAE2. Based on several geochemical proxies (Rb, V, Ni, Cr, Si, Ba), the BL is interpreted as a high-productivity event driven by increasingly warm and humid climatic conditions promoting an accelerated hydrological cycle. The enrichment factors of peculiar trace metals (Zn, Cd, Pb, Sb, Mo, U) provide further insight about the H2S activity at the seafloor during the organic-rich sediment deposition and permitted us to evaluate the use of Ba as palaeoproductivity tracer in conditions of high rate of sulphate reduction.By comparing geochemical records from the reference Bottaccione section (central Italy) with those previously obtained for the coeval Calabianca section (northwestern Sicily), different degrees of oceanic anoxia were delineated and ascribed to different abundance and type (degradable or refractory) of organic matter, which are limiting factors in the bacterial sulphate reduction reactions and in subsequent euxinic conditions at seafloor in the Tethys realm. Based on a ciclostratigraphic approach, consistent fluctuations at 100 ky scale in the chemostratigraphic signals from the two sections are inferred to be expression of a strong orbital-climatic forcing driving changes in the oceanic environment during the BL deposition.

J	Mishra, R.K.; Marhas, K.K.								On the origin of 7Be isotopic records in a Calcium, Aluminium, -rich inclusion [arXiv]								arXiv								51 pp.	51 pp.						3 April 2019	2019	A prime question in the formation and early evolution of the Solar system studies is to discern the source(s) of short-lived now extinct nuclides and to determine the ab-initio isotopic composition of our Solar System1. The proposed genesis of a short-lived now extinct radionuclide,10Be, by spallation reactions of carbon and oxygen led to the hypothesis of enhanced irradiation in the early Solar system2-8. An alternative scenario of production of 10Be (t1/2 = 1.386 +or- 0.016 million years9) by ldquonurdquo process in a low mass star (11.8Modot) core collapse supernova has been recently suggested10 that can explain the observed abundance of 10Be in the early Solar System. Here, we report well resolved excesses in 7Li/6Li of up to ~21.5 % in a Type B1 Ca,-Al rich inclusion (CAI) from the Efremovka meteorite that correlate with 9Be/6Li, suggestive of in situ decay of 7Be. The in situ decay of 7Be, with characteristic half-life of 53.12 +or- 0.07 days11 to 7Li, entails multiple episodes of enhanced irradiation in the ESS. The short half-life of 7Be limits its production by interaction of Solar energetic particles with the nebular gas and solids and provides constraints on genealogy and chronology of CAIs. Irradiation of precursor solids/gas of CAIs of Solar composition by a superflare (Lx ap 1032 erg/sec) during the terminal phase of class I or II of pre-main sequence stages of the Sun cogently explains the isotopic properties, distinctive petrographic features, and diffusivity constraints in the CAI.									0	0	0		0	0	0						INSPEC:18860625

As the electrodes, they have been widely applied in the current energy storage and conversion processes such as supercapacitors, Lithium-ion batteries and fuel cells. Based on synthesis approaches and controlled conditions, these two materials exhibited broad morphologies and nanostructures and thus distinct electrochemical performance. Some of them have shown promising applications as electrodes in energy storage and conversion. The incorporation with other materials to form composites further improved their performance. This review briefly summarized the recent applications of FeCo2O4 and CoFe2O4 in energy storage and conversion, current understandings on mechanisms and especially the relevance of morphologies and structures and composites to electrochemical performance. Some recommendations were finally put forward addressing current issues and future prospects on electrodes of FeCo2O4 and CoFe2O4 based materials in energy storage and conversion, implying there was still space to further optimize their performance.									31	0	0	0	1	0	31			1996-1073			WOS:000417046500106

It is present in almost all or all organisms. Its synthetic pathway depends on the species in which it is measured. For example, the tryptophan to melatonin pathway differs in plants and animals. It is speculated that the melatonin synthetic machinery in eukaryotes was inherited from bacteria as a result of endosymbiosis. However, melatonin's synthetic mechanisms in microorganisms are currently unknown. Melatonin metabolism is highly complex with these enzymatic processes having evolved from cytochrome C. In addition to its enzymatic degradation, melatonin is metabolized via pseudoenzymatic and free radical interactive processes. The metabolic products of these processes overlap and it is often difficult to determine which process is dominant. However, under oxidative stress, the free radical interactive pathway may be featured over the others. Because of the complexity of the melatonin degradative processes, it is expected that additional novel melatonin metabolites will be identified in future investigations. The original and primary function of melatonin in early life forms such as in unicellular organisms was as a free radical scavenger and antioxidant. During evolution, melatonin was selected as a signaling molecule to transduce the environmental photoperiodic information into an endocrine message in multicellular organisms and for other purposes as well. As an antioxidant, melatonin exhibits several unique features which differ from the classic antioxidants. These include its cascade reaction with free radicals and its capacity to be induced under moderate oxidative stress. These features make melatonin a potent endogenously-occurring antioxidant that protects organisms from catastrophic oxidative stress.									315	16	2	0	209	0	330			1420-3049			WOS:000364231200066	26501252

The deposit, known as the ironstone pods, formed by seafloor hydrothermal activity and fluid discharge. Quartz is dominated by type I liquid-vapor; aqueous inclusions with a bimodal salinity distribution (0-0.25 MCl- and 0.9-1.8 MCl-). Bulk analytical salinities range from 0.45 to 0.99 MCl- and represent averages of type I inclusions. Bulk fluid inclusion bromide and iodide concentrations are 1.44-3.32 mM and 0.01-0.12 mM, respectively. For comparison, modem seawater has halogen contents of 590 mM chloride, 0.9 mM bromide, and 0.5 mu M total iodine. In the fluids from the ironstone pods, bromide and iodide are enriched relative to chloride, when compared with modern seawater.Approximate Br-/Cl- and I-/Cl- ratios of 3.2 Ga Barberton seawater are 2.5 x 10(-3) and 40 x 10(-6), respectively. Dispersion to higher values was caused principally by reaction with organic sediments whose trends are similar to those seen for modem vent fluids at unsedimented and sedimented ridges, relative to modem seawater. These halide ratios are greater than those of modern seawater, suggesting a change in the halide ratios of seawater over geological time. The analytical data are consistent with a model in which marine organic sedimentation has fractionated bromine and iodine out of seawater relative to chloride, thereby causing the halide ratios of seawater to decrease from high early and mid-Archean values towards their present day values.

Herein, a class of anion-vacancy and cation-substitution proof-of-concept atomically thin CoSe(2 )subnanometer belts (SBs) are reported to greatly boost the electrooxidation of butylamine into high-value-added butyronitrile coupled with hydrogen generation. The as-fabricated CoSe2 SBs with Se vacancies and Ni substitutions (CoSe2/Ni-SVs SBs) exhibit an ultralow onset potential of 1.3 V with up to a similar to 98.5% butyronitrile Faradaic efficiency, which surpasses all the reported Co-and Ni-based catalysts. In situ electrochemical FTIR and EIS spectroscopy studies indicate that the dramatically enhanced electrooxidation performance can be attributed to the optimized adsorption behavior and accelerated dehydrogenation kinetics. Theoretical studies further reveal that Se vacancies can act as strong Lewis acid sites to effectively strengthen the adsorption of N atoms, whereas Ni substitutions are responsible for improving the dehydrogenation thermodynamics by optimizing the sequence of dehydrogenation steps. We further demonstrate that the CoSe2/Ni-SVs SBs are highly general and efficient catalysts for the electrosynthesis of propylamine, benzylamine, and cyclohexane methylamine into nitriles coupled with hydrogen generation. More importantly, a CoSe2/Ni-SVs SB-based two-electrode electrolyzer that uses amine oxidation at the anode can achieve a voltage of 1.37 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which can lower the cell voltage by even 320 mV compared to that of a conventional two-electrode electrolyzer that uses the oxygen evolution reaction at the anode.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000855629200001

The molecular emissions were observed to be stronger in the fs spectra whereas atomic emissions were prominent in the ns spectra recorded in both air and argon atmospheres. The C-2 Swan band was strongest in an argon atmosphere while the CN violet band was strongest in ambient environment. The LIB spectra were analysed for understanding (a) the influence of molecular structure i.e. type of bonds (C-C, C=C, C-N and on atomic (C, H, N and O) and molecular (CN, C-2 and NH) emissions, (b) effect of surrounding atmosphere on the fs and ns LIB spectra, (c) correlation between stoichiometric and intensity ratios of molecular as well as atomic species, (d) effect of the number of substituents and their position in the ring on the fragmentation pathways and (e) correlation between oxygen balance and LIB spectra. Furthermore, time resolved spectroscopic studies of the plasma induced by fs and ns laser pulses have been carried out to understand the temporal evolution and possible reaction mechanisms of various molecular species. An attempt has been made to correlate the spectral emission with the chemical structure for this series of energetic materials. Our detailed studies and analyses clearly suggest that the atomization/fragmentation ratio could serve as a performance metric for high energy materials.									36	0	0	0	9	0	36			0267-9477	1364-5544		WOS:000372857300012

Firstly, Ni-SiO2 composite film was fabricated on a stainless steel substrate by electrodeposition, and then the SiO2 template was removed in alkaline electrolyte by consecutive cyclic voltammetry scans, leading to the formation of a porous Ni (po-Ni) matrix. The structure and morphology of the obtained films were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The highly porous property of the po-Ni matrix is believed to be quite favourable for electrochemical applications. The electrochemical properties of the po-Ni film were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and steady-state polarization curves. The results showed that the porous Ni derived from the Ni-SiO2 composite film exhibits good electrochemical performance for potential use as a supercapacitor material and catalyst for water splitting.									21	1	1	0	0	0	22			2050-7488			WOS:000325413000026

In the SEDEX model, base metals (Zn, Pb, Fe) are hydrothermally vented into sulfidic (euxinic) seawater and deposited coevally with the organic-rich mudstone host rock, resulting in laterally extensive layered mineralization. In the Selwyn Basin (Canada) at Macmillan Pass, two deposits (Tom, Jason) are well preserved in a succession of Upper Devonian mudstones and are considered type-characteristic examples of the SEDEX deposit model. As with a number of SEDEX deposits, at Macmillan Pass barite is abundant in the succession hosting hydrothermal mineralization. Early work presented a hydrothermal model for barite formation, in which barite coprecipitated with base metal sulfides in a redox-stratified water column. Recently, however, studies have both proposed an alternative diagenetic model for barite formation and provided more precise constraints on the chemistry of the hydrothermal fluid that entered the vent complexes. Here, we present a new model for Macmillan Pass in which sulfide mineralization occurred entirely within the subsurface. The introduction of hot (300 degrees C) hydrothermal fluids into the shallow subsurface (<1-km depth) resulted in the thermal degradation of organic matter and generated CO2; this promoted barite dissolution, which both provided a source of sulfate for thermochemical sulfate reduction and increased the porosity and permeability within the system. Importantly, there was clear potential for the development of positive feedbacks and self-organization between diagenetic and hydrothermal processes, resulting in highly efficient ore-forming systems. In contrast to the SEDEX model, alteration footprints will be controlled by the mass transfer involved in (barite) replacement reactions rather than hydrothermal venting, and exploration criteria at a district scale should strongly favor highly productive continental margins.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0361-0128	1554-0774		WOS:000558592400001		
B	Shutong Song; Chunqi Jiang								Spectroscopic and Electrical Studies of Pulse Width on Oh Radicals in a Pulsed He Plasmajet in Contact with Water								2018 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS)								1 pp.	1 pp.		10.1109/ICOPS35962.2018.9576053				2018	2018	Hydroxyl radical plays an important role in many biomedical applications (e.g. wound disinfection and cancer treatment) due to its strong oxidation potential. This study investigated the effects of pulse width ranging from 200 ns to 4 mus on generation and evolution of OH radicals in a pulsed helium plasma jet interacting with a water-covered ground electrode under 6 kV pulses at 1 kHz via emission spectroscopy and electrical measurements. Integrated optical emission spectroscopy revealed that total OH yield along the discharge gap increased with pulse width up to 800 ns and decreased with pulse width increasing from 800 ns to 4 mus. Terephthalic acid (TA) was used to trap OH radicals forming 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (HTA) from which the fluorescence can be measured for determining OHaq concentration in liquid. It is found that the highest OH yield in liquid phase was at a pulse width of 200 ns. These results suggest that higher production efficiency for OH radicals in both gas- and liquid- phase can be obtained with pulse widths in the nanosecond-range under studied experimental conditions. In addition, temporally and spatially resolved gas-phase OH is discussed. Correlations between the OH emission intensity and its correspondent electrical parameters under various pulse widths are discussed.					2018 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS)2018 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS)	24-28 June 201824-28 June 2018		Denver, CO, USADenver, CO, USA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-5386-4589-5	INSPEC:21461073

The major rock-forming minerals include calcite and dolomite, showing microcrystalline, coarse-grained and recrystallized texture. In some original rocks, different types of the fusulina and crinoid fossils are found with varying sizes and kinds. These are probable to be index fossils indicating that the original rock came from the middle Carboniferous Period. The new rock material added for the restoration is massive light gray marble with well-developed fine laminations. Its major rock-forming minerals include calcite and dolomite with muscovite, quartz and ankerite. Geochemical composition reveals that the original and new materials have different evolution trends and carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions also show different between the two. The frequent forms of physical deteriorations on the pagoda are cracks in the stone and the old reinforced part, losses, exfoliations and surface abrasion. The most dominant form is crack. In addition, about 60% of the rock surface is covered with black contaminants. There are yellowish brown precipitates around the iron plates tying the rock blocks. And light gray precipitates are scattered on the rock surfaces. The precipitates are usually a mixture of gypsum, anhydrite, calcite, goethite and graphite, resulted from complex reactions between the original rock, restoration materials and air pollutants. They form crusts on the rock surface. The pagoda consists of total 145 rock blocks. During restoration project, the 23 rock blocks of the stylobate (about 45%) were replaced with new ones. The problem is that the new rocks have different physical properties from the original rocks, and thus it may cause a structural distortion. Also, it gives rise to different looking against the original. Therefore, it is very important for the pagoda to be monitored and maintained with careful observation.				경천사석탑을 구성하고 있는 원부재는 대부분 세립질의 회백색 대리암으로서 조성, 조직 및 색에 따라 여러 종류의 암상으로 세분된다. 주요 조암광물은 방해석과 백운석으로 미정질, 거정질 및 재결정 조직이 혼재한다. 일부 석재에서는 크기와 종류가 다른 여러 종류의 방추충과 해백합 화석이 관찰된다. 이는 석재의 원석이 중부 석탄기의 암석임을 지시하는 표준화석일 가능성이 있다. 복원용 대체석으로 사용한 신부재는 회백색에 미세 층리가 발달된 괴상 대리암으로서 방해석과 백운석이 주요 조암광물이며 백운모, 석영 및 앵커라이트가 검출되었다. 이 석탑의 원부재와 신부재는 서로 다른 지구화학적 진화경향을 보여주었으며, 탄소 및 산소동위원소 조성에도 다소 차이가 있는 것으로 나타났다. 이 석탑에 나타난 물리적 훼손상태는 보강부분의 이격, 석재의 균열, 결실, 박리박락, 표면마모 및 파손 등으로서, 가장 심각한 현상은 균열과 파손이다. 또한 경천사석탑 전체 표면석재의 60% 정도가 흑색 오염물로 피복되어 있고, 석재를 고정하기 위해 설치한 철편 주변에는 황갈색 침전물들이 고착되어 있으며, 석재의 표면에는 부분적으로 회백색 침전물이 산재한다. 오염물들의 대부분은 석고, 경석고, 방해석, 침철석과 흑연의 혼합물질로서 원석재와 기존의 보강물질 및 대기오염물질이 복합적으로 작용하여 생성된 것이 석재의 표면에서 피각상을 이루고 있는 것이다. 이 석탑은 총 145개의 석재로 구성되어 있으며, 복원과정에서 기단부 부재의 45%에 달하는 23개를 신석재로 교체하였다. 신부재는 원부재와의 물성이 서로 달라 구조적 왜곡을 초래할 수 있으며, 보존처리된 부재와 이질감을 줄 수 있어 지속적인 관리가 필요하다					0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0435-4036			KJD:ART001310478

The Cu-treated control strain showed a negative correlation in growth and intracellular Cu, partial inhibition of O-2-evolution, PS II, PS I, whole chain, chlorophyll absorption, and nitrogenase activity. However, the acclimated strain growing in 250-fold excess Cu exhibited near normal growth, ATP content, PS I activity, carbon fixation, and almost complete inhibition of O-2-evolution, PS II and chlorophyll absorption, but increased nitrogenase activity as compared to control. Proteomic decoding of the survival strategy of Cu-treated control and the acclimated strain using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF MS analysis of proteins displaying significant and reproducible changes demonstrated involvement of transketolase, phycoerythrocyanin alpha-chain, iron superoxide dismutase (Fe-SOD), hypothetical protein alr 0803, manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), phosphoribulokinase, and plastocyanin (PLC). Expression pattern of these proteins was attested at the transcriptional level using RT-PCR. Time course analysis of proteins of Cu-treated control strain revealed almost no change in PLC level, and a minor accumulation of transketolase, phycoerythrocyanin alpha-chain and both isoforms of SOD after 7 and recovery after 10 days. Acclimated strain under excess Cu, however, exhibited significant accumulation of both isoforms of SOD, plastocyanin, phosphoribulokinase and transketolase, which seem to counteract oxidative damage, serve as an alternate electron carrier from cytochrome b6/f complex to photosystem I and meet the NADPH and ATP requirements, respectively, under anoxygenic photosynthesis.

This is due to their chemical stability, adjustable optoelectronic properties, suitable band edge alignment, and large surface-to-volume ratio. The inherent high density of surface trapping states and the lack of compatible conductive substrates, however, hindered their use as stable photo-catalysts. We have designed, synthesized and tested an efficient photocatalytic system using stable In0.33Ga0.67N-based nanorods (NRs) grown on an all-metal stack substrate (Ti-Mo) for a better electron transfer process. In addition, we have applied a bifunctional ultrathin thiol-based organic surface treatment using 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT), in which sulfur atoms protected the surface from oxidation. This treatment has dual functions, it passivates the surface (by the removal of dangling bonds) and creates ligands for linking Ir-metal ions as oxygen evolution centers on top of the semiconductor. This treatment when applied to In0.33Ga0.67N NRs resulted in a photo-catalyst that achieved 3.5% solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency, in pure water (pH similar to 7, buffer solution) under simulated one-sun (AM1.5G) illumination and without electrical bias. Over the tested period, a steady increase of the gas evolution rate was observed from which a turnover frequency of 0.23 s(-1) was calculated. The novel growth of InGaN-based NRs on a metal as well as the versatile surface functionalization techniques (EDT-Ir) have a high potential for making stable photo-catalysts with adjustable band gaps and band edges to harvest sun light.									42	2	0	0	2	0	42			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000402704500018		
J	Yin, Hong; Guan, Ni; Dong, Lijun; Yue, Qiaoyun; Yin, Xiangchu; Zhang, Daochuan								Initial analysis of the hemocyanin subunit type 1 (Hc1 gene) from Locusta migratoria manilensis								MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS				39	3			3305	3310		10.1007/s11033-011-1099-1				MAR 2012	2012	Hemocyanins are copper-containing (Cu+) proteins that transport oxygen in many arthropods hemolymph. We characterized Hc1 gene from the grasshopper species Locusta migratoria manilensis. In particular, we cloned and sequenced the corresponding cDNAs and studied their expression at different developmental stages. The cDNA of Hc1 gene (GenBank accession no.: HQ213937) is 2271 bp in length and the open reading frame is 2016 bp, which encodes a 672 amino acids protein with a calculated molecular mass of 77.9 kD and the iso-electric point of 6.06. Sequence alignment analysis result showed that this gene shares 94.7% identity with Schistocerca americana EHP. In addition, analysis of quantitative RT-PCR indicated that, LmiHc1 was expressed in the embyro (24, 39, 62, 86, 144, and 193 h after hatch), nymphs (1st instar, 2nd instar, 3rd instar, 4th instar and 5th instar) and in adult. These results showed that Hc1 plays an important role in grasshopper, which may be related to an enhanced oxygen supply. Phylogenetic analysis of insecta based on Hc1 are basically consistent with the morphology.									3	2	0	0	4	0	5			0301-4851			WOS:000301107800145	21706352

In this work, a reversible near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence probe (XC) was designed and synthesized for the monitoring of HSO3-/H2O2-regulated cycles in vivo. The XC probe contains a D-pi-A-pi-D conjugated structure with a reactive C-C double bond in the benzopyrylium moiety. In the presence of HSO3-, a nucleophilic addition reaction with the unsaturated carbon atom of XC occurred and rearranged the structure from the positively charged benzopyrylium moiety to neutral chromene. The HSO3--induced nucleophilic addition product (XC-SO3) can be oxidized to the native XC, resulting in the reversible responses to HSO3-/H2O2 cycles. In the presence of HSO3-, XC presented a significant decrease in the absorption and emission spectra, as well as a solution colour change from blue to colourless under physiological conditions (pH = 7.4), which allows for the detection of HSO3- by the "naked eye". By further incubation of XC-SO3 with H2O2, the spectroscopic and colour signals were recovered. Biologically relevant species including anions, reactive oxygen species (ROS), biothiols and cations induced negligible spectroscopic responses. The detection limits of XC for HSO3- and XC-SO3 for H2O2 were calculated to be 1.02 mu M and 0.84 mu M, respectively. XC has several advantages such as high selectivity, reliability at physiological pH and low cytotoxicity, which enable its application in biological samples. Fluorescence imaging experiments in live adult zebrafish and live nude mice demonstrated that XC has the potential to monitor the HSO3-/H2O2-regulated redox homeostasis in biosystems. The practical applications of XC were also demonstrated by the quantitative analysis of HSO3- in white wine and sugar samples.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000703148900001

In this work, we present a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) catalyst with modulation of N assembled states by Fe particles. The synthetic NC@Fe electrocatalyst enabled efficient and durable CO2 reduction at the maximum CO Faradaic efficiency of 90.6 % and 93 % reservation of its initial activity after long-term electrolysis. Studies from experiments and DFT calculations indicated that Fe particles induced formation of N-doped carbon layers in NC@Fe electrocatalyst. These N-doped carbon layers provide more N-assembled domains on the surface, in which the triple graphitic N, triple pyridinic N and graphitic-pyrrolic N configurations were revealed to reduce the formation energy of key intermediates *COOH and *CO for efficient CO2-to-CO conversion. These results are hoped to motivate more research on modulation over chemical states of heteroatoms toward synthesis of efficient carbon-based catalysts for electrocatalytic applications.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2196-0216			WOS:000519650500011

To find the optimal electrocatalyst, a prerequisite is an activity metric that reasonably evaluates the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of a particular catalyst. The intrinsic activity is commonly defined as the specific activity which is the current per unit catalyst surface area. Thus, the precise assessment of intrinsic activity highly depends on the reliable measurement of catalyst surface area, which calls for the knowledge of experimental approaches for determining the surface areas of metal oxide electrocatalysts. This tutorial review aims to summarize and analyze the approaches for measuring the surface areas of metal oxide electrocatalysts for evaluating and comparing their intrinsic electrocatalytic activities. We start by comparing the popular metrics for activity estimation and highlighting the importance of surface-area-normalized activity (i.e. specific activity) for intrinsic chemistry analysis. Second, we provide some general guidelines for experimentally measuring the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). Third, we review the methods for the surface area measurement of metal oxide electrocatalysts. The detailed procedure for each method is explicitly described to provide a step-by-step manual that guides researchers to perform the measurement; the rationales and uncertainties for each method are discussed to help readers justify the reliable assessment of surface area. Next, we give our recommendations on selecting a rational experimental approach for the surface area measurement of a particular metal oxide electrocatalyst. Lastly, we discuss the future challenges of ECSA measurement and present an exemplary novel ECSA technique.									255	14	0	0	14	0	257			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000468628400001	30976760

We report an electrochemical/chemical exfoliation strategy for synthesizing metal-organic 2D materials based on coordination bonds. A catechol functionalized ligand is used as the redox active pillar to construct a pillared-layer framework. When the 3D pillared-layer MOF serves as an electrocatalyst for water oxidation (pH13), the pillar ligands can be oxidized insitu and removed. The remaining ultrathin (2nm) nanosheets of the metal-organic layers are an efficient catalyst with overpotentials as low as 211 mV at 10 mAcm(-2) and a turnover frequency as high as 30 s(-1) at an overpotential of 300 mV.									209	15	0	0	15	0	208			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000430165700032	29457327

Even though many efforts have been expended to prepare nano-Co3O4, the development of novel methods to prepare Co3O4 using simple processes and at low cost remain a topic of interest. Besides, it could be economic and useful if the synthesized nanoparticle could be applied as efficient electrocatalyst upon its immobilization on a cheap base electrode material by very simple method for various practical applications including renewable energy.Method: We prepared nano-Co3O4 by a direct thermal decomposition of an inexpensive, simple and widely available cobalt inorganic precursor, such as Co(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O without any type of pre-reaction or processing. The nano-Co3O4 was immobilized on filter-paper-derived carbon electrode by drop-drying method for applying as electrode materials toward water electrooxidation.Results: The X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy analysis confirmed the formation of short nanorods of single-phase Co3O4 upon thermal decomposition of Co(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O at 520 degrees C. The electrocatalytic properties of the nano-Co3O4 were evaluated after immobilizing it on a cheap carbon electrode derived from normal filter paper. The modified electrode showed good electrocatalytic properties toward water oxidation in an alkaline solution.Conclusion: In conclusion, we developed a very simple, straight-forward and economic method for preparation of nano-Co3O4 and immobilized it on very cheap carbon electrode for evaluating its electrocatalytic properties. Due to the high electrocatalytic properties, the prepared nano-Co3O4 could potentially play an important role in various practical fields.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1573-4137	1875-6786		WOS:000424055700010

In this study we have performed density functional calculations on Cu-i/M-j/Cu(211) sandwiched surfaces and Cu-i/M(211) overlayers (where M = Rh or Ni, with varied i and j monolayers). We examined the free energy profiles of the reaction mechanisms for CO2 reduction to CO and CH4. We find that in Cu-1/M-1/Cu(211), in which the Cu monolayer experiences only a pure ligand effect, the influence of Ni is weaker than Rh and it decreases the overpotential for CO2 reduction by similar to 1020 mV. A larger decrease (3364 mV) in the overpotential is predicted for other sandwiched surfaces: Cu-1/Ni-2/Cu(211), Cu-2/Rh-1/Cu(211), and Cu-2/Rh-2/Cu(211) in which the ligand effect is weaker. In the Cu-1/M(211) overlayer, Cu is affected by both the strain and ligand effects, of which the latter dominates. As the number of Cu monolayers increases from one to three, the strain effect becomes dominant in the Cu overlayers. We demonstrate that the tensile strain on Cu in Cu-23/Rh(211) overlayers causes a significant decrease (by 86 mV) in the overpotential for CO2 electroreduction, while the compressive strain in Cu-23/Ni(211) overlayers has an opposite effect. Furthermore, Cu-2/Rh-2/Cu(211) and Cu-23/Rh(211) will also exhibit an increase in exchange current density, i.e., electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction. This is accompanied by a retention of selectivity for CO and CH4 over hydrogen evolution.									30	2	0	0	1	0	30			1932-7447			WOS:000395616200044

The results show that the anode Pb-0.62Ag alloy had a lower overpotential for anode reaction than the others. The corrosion resistance after polarisation of the anode Pb-0.62Ag alloy was higher than that of the Pb-0.29Ag-0.1Ca alloy, Pb-0.58Ag alloy and Pb-0.67Ag alloy, but lower than that of the anode Pb-0.72Ag alloy. However, the anode Pb-0.72Ag alloy had the highest overpotential. When anodes Pb-0.72Ag alloy and Pb-0.62Ag alloy were used, the cathode current efficiencies were higher, while anodes Pb-0.29Ag-0.1Ca alloy, Pb-0.58Ag alloy and Pb-0.67Ag alloy gave lower current efficiency. Regarding these several factors, the anode Pb-0.62Ag alloy is the best choice.									1	2	0	0	0	0	2			0008-4433	1879-1395		WOS:000323819700009

The oxide growth proceeds by inverse logarithmic kinetics with two distinguishable kinetic regions leading to linear relations between 1/q(OX), and log t(p). The first 1/q(OX) vs. log t(p) linear region corresponds to development of the quasi-2D state (OC1) and the very initial growth of the OC2 state, and the oxide growth in this t(p) domain is slow. Further growth of OC2 and formation of the OC3 and OC4 states is significantly faster. The oxide growth kinetics change when 1/q(OX) reaches a value of ca. 0.10mC(-1) cm(2). In situ ellipsometry measurements indicate the presence of two distinct layers within the oxide films, the inner layer designated alpha and the outer one designated beta. The alpha film corresponds to the OC1 state whereas the beta film corresponds to the OC2, OC3 and OC4 states. The OC1 state reaches a limiting thickness of 3 equiv. monolayers of AuO or Au(OH)(2) in aqueous H2SO4 and 1 monolayer of AuO or Au(OH)(2) in aqueous KOH. The beta state which resides on top of the a one grows without reaching any limiting thickness and up to 100equiv, monolayers of Au2O3 or Au(OH)(3), depending on the electrolyte composition, can be formed under the conditions described in the present paper.									107	8	0	0	13	1	112			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:A1997WX98600017

Herein, a novel carbon quantum dots-modified reduced ultrathin g-C3N4 (RUCN/CQD) photocatalyst was successfully synthesized, with the capacity for direct center dot OH and O-2(center dot-) yields and a broad-spectrum response. Upon broad-spectrum light irradiation, the RUCN/CQD demonstrated a 100% removal rate for diclofenac (DCF) within six min. This remarkable performance was attributed to a customized band structure with a thermodynamic driving potential for the generation of center dot OH, CQD with an effective electron transfer capacity for promotional formation of O-2(center dot-), and ultrathin porous structure with abundant reaction sites. Simultaneously, the up-converted fluorescent properties of the CQD endowed the photocatalyst with a broad-spectrum response. The RUCN/CQD system also exhibited superior photocatalytic activities under simulated natural conditions, which implied an immense potential for the remediation of PPCPs in ambient waterways.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000664246600003

The in situ growth and tight immobilization of the CoMoO4 nanocomposite on the carbon cloth can facilitate the electrolyte infiltration and electrons transfer rate at the contact interface. Therefore, the free-standing electrode of CoMoO4/carbon cloth with interconnected nanosheets shows superior electrocatalytic activity, and the overpotential of 286 mV is obtained at 15 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution. Moreover, the catalyst also exhibits a small Tafel slope of 67 mV dec(-1) as well as good stability. The relationship between the active material morphology, contact interface and the electrocatalytic performance is also discussed. As the carbon cloth is commercially available, this simple but effective structural controlling method demonstrates a new large-scale practical electrode fabrication technique for high performance OER electrodes and large-scale water splitting.									25	1	0	0	4	0	25			2046-2069			WOS:000457292800044	35518022

The nanocomposite also had been well characterized and tested for its photocatalytic activity toward reduction of 10 ppm K2Cr2O7 aqueous solution under visible light illumination. It was found that 30 % Cu2O loading in the nanocomposite had the best photocatalytic activity in detoxifying Cr(VI) without any hole scavenger agents and the solution pH adjustment. As a result, water was simultaneously oxidized by photogenerated holes to evolve oxygen. The 20 mg as-prepared TiO2/Cu2O nanocomposites could reduce almost 100 % of 10 ppm K2Cr2O7 aqueous solution in 90 min under 150 W halogen lamp illumination. From the results, it was concluded that the photocatalytic activities of p-n heterojunction of TiO2/Cu2O nanodiodes had proven to be an efficient photocatalyst under visible light illumination. The photocatalytic performances of TiO2/Cu2O nanocomposites and its photoreaction mechanism were proposed and discussed in this work.									27	5	0	0	3	0	29			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000378542500034

This review covers recent progress in g-C3N4-containing systems for fuel cells, electrocatalytic water splitting devices, supercapacitors, and lithium-ion batteries. The corresponding catalytic mechanisms and future research directions in these areas are also discussed.									165	17	0	0	18	0	171			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000351617500002	25688746

Optimum temperature and humidity conditions may improve wine quality through ageing, while incorrect or excessively long storage leads to negative results. In order to evaluate the global effects of storage on red wine composition, 20 Sangiovese wines were stored in two different conditions (cellar or house) for a period of 2 years and analysed every 6 months. Untargeted LC-MS analysis showed various putative markers for the type and length of conservation (i.e. pigments, flavanols, pantothenic acid etc.), while targeted LC-MS confirmed and expanded these results within specific metabolic groups. The results of multivariate analysis showed that wines stored in the cellar changed little even after 2 years of storage, while wines stored in typical domestic conditions (house) developed approximately four times faster, reaching a composition similar to wines stored in the cellar for 2 years after just 6 months. The formation of several monosulfonated flavanols during domestic ageing provided the first evidence in wine of a reaction between wine tannins-both catechins and proanthocyanidins-and the exogenous antioxidant bisulfite. Moreover, ageing in domestic conditions appeared to induce an accelerated decrease in wine pigments, while specifically promoting the formation of pinotin A-like pigments and the hydrolysis of flavonol glycosides.									71	0	0	0	49	2	73			1573-3882	1573-3890		WOS:000341422600005

Film and interface layer composition of rare earth (Lu,Yb) oxides deposited by ALD								Rare Earth Oxide Thin Films. Growth, Characterization, and Applications								127	42						2006	2006	Thin Lu2O3, Yb2O3, and Lu silicate layers were grown on Si using atomic layer deposition (ALD), and studied mainly with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and low-energy ion spectroscopy (LEIS). Experimental results on elemental composition and chemical state both in thin oxide layers and at the interface with the Si substrate, and their evolution upon different heat treatments, are presented. Besides oxygen states attributed to stoichiometric RE2O3 (RE=Lu,Yb) and OH-, an additional, loosely bound state is identified in a subsurface layer at equilibrium conditions for both Lu2O3 and Yb2O3 layers. A variety of thin (amorphous) Lu silicate films grown by ALD with different compositions depending on the precursor and/or growth conditions was unambiguously established by XPS, the components' chemical shifts found to be a monotonous function of the composition. As grown continuous ultrathin (les5 nm) Lu and Yb oxide films on Si appear to consist of a hydroxide on top and of a silicate layer, ~1-3 nm in thickness, at the interface with the Si substrate, the stack is converted into amorphous silicates upon post-deposition annealing in N2 and appears further stable on Si at least up to annealing at T=11.00degC (in N2).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1					3-540-35796-3	INSPEC:9306873		
J	Barton, ES; Hallbauer, DK								Trace-element and U-Pb isotope compositions of pyrite types in the Proterozoic Black Reef, Transvaal Sequence, South Africa: Implications on genesis and age								CHEMICAL GEOLOGY				133	1-4			173	199		10.1016/S0009-2541(96)00075-7				NOV 22 1996	1996	The Proterozoic Black Reef is, in most cases, indistinguishable from the gold-, uranium- and pyrite-bearing Archaean Witwatersrand reefs. However, the prevailing opinion that the Black Reef gold mineralization was largely derived from reworking of the underlying Kimberley Reef is not supported by the morphology, trace-element geochemistry and U-Pb isotope data on detrital pyrite in these reefs. The grade of metamorphism recorded in the Black Reef Quartzite Formation is significantly lower than the 300-400 degrees C that has been proposed for the sediments of the Witwatersrand Supergroup. The U-Pb isotope and trace-element geochemical signatures in pyrite have, therefore, been preserved in the Black Reef. The morphological and compositional differences retained by the detrital and synsedimentary pyrite types, both occurring together in the Black Reef, imply that they were formed by different processes and in contrasting geochemical environments. In the Black Reef, the data for the detrital pyrite are consistent with their derivation from a similar to 3000-2800-Ma granitic, probably hydrothermally altered, source region. By contrast, the geochemical and Pb-isotopic composition of the concretionary pyrite is interpreted to reflect its synsedimentary formation in a lagoonal or tidal flat environment prior to similar to 2500 Ma. The morphology, primary mineral inclusions and the unradiogenic Pb-isotopic compositions preserved in the Black Reef detrital pyrite are irreconcilable with models proposed for the formation of Witwatersrand pyrite by a process of pyritization of Fe-bearing detrital minerals. Fluids present in the Black Reef depositional/diagenetic environment were anomalously enriched in radiogenic Pb and any transformation process would not be able to escape acquiring this enriched Pb-isotopic signature.									54	6	2	0	3	0	57			0009-2541			WOS:A1996VX80100010

Current research in microbial sciences				3				100148	100148		10.1016/j.crmicr.2022.100148				2022	2022	Exposure to antibiotics most often generates oxidative stress in bacteria. Oxidative stress survival mechanisms would facilitate the evolution of antibiotic resistance. As part of an effort to understand oxidative stress survival mechanisms in mycobacteria, here we show that the minor subpopulation (SCs; short-sized cells constituting 10% of the population) of Mycobacterium smegmatis significantly increased the survival of its major kin subpopulation (NCs; normal/long-sized cells constituting 90% of the population) in the mid-log-phase (MLP) cultures against the oxidative stress induced by rifampicin and exogenously added H2O2 (positive control). We had earlier shown that the SCs in the MLP cultures inherently and naturally release significantly high levels of H2O2 into the medium. Addition of the SCs' culture supernatant, unlike the supernatant of the dimethylthiourea (H2O2 scavenger) exposed SCs, enhanced the survival of NCs. It indicated that NCs' survival required the H2O2 present in the SCs' supernatant. This H2O2 transcriptionally induced high levels of catalase-peroxidase (KatG) in the NCs. The naturally high KatG levels in the NCs significantly neutralised the endogenous H2O2 formed upon exposure to rifampicin or H2O2, thereby enhancing the survival of NCs against oxidative stress. The absence of such enhanced survival in the furA-katG and katG knockout (KO) mutants of NCs in the presence of wild-type SCs, confirmed the requirement of the H2O2 present in the SCs' supernatant and NCs' KatG for enhanced oxidative stress survival. The presence of SCs:NCs at 1:9 in the pulmonary tuberculosis patients' sputum alludes to the clinical significance of the finding.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2666-5174		MEDLINE:35909613	35909613

All prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, UV-visible spectroscopy and impedance spectroscopy. The X-ray diffraction characterization at room temperature indicated the formation of perovskite phase in all the samples. The X-ray diffraction data refined by Rietveld technique revealed two phase transitions with the increase of BiFeO3 content, the first structural transformation from tetragonal (P4mm) to cubic (Pm (3) over barm) and the second from cubic (Pm (3) over barm) to rhombohedral (R3c), which were confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. UV-vis absorption spectra of doped compounds indicated the presence of four electronic transitions in octahedrally coordinated Fe3+ ions from their fundamental (6)A(1g) (S) level to different excited levels. The co-doping of Bi3+ and Fe3+ ions from 0% to 80 mol% leads to a decrease of the direct band gap energy from 3.29 to 1.91 eV, and a shift of the band gap edges, namely the conduction band minimum and valence band maximum. The impedance results suggest that both grain (G) and grain boundary (GB) contribute to the total conductivity and the effect of this latter increases with (Bi, Fe) content. Additionally, the Nyquist plots showed the negative temperature coefficient of resistance (NTCR) and the temperature-dependent dc electrical conductivity demonstrated the semiconducting nature for all samples. The sample x = 0.4 exhibited the highest dc electrical conductivity. The activation energy values revealed that the conduction mechanism is dominated by ionized oxygen vacancies. The changes of dielectric properties at room temperature with increasing BiFeO3-doping amount are discussed.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000691182900004

In 1, the opda(2- )ligand exhibits a trans-conformation and acts as a bridging building block extending a 1D loop-containing (Ni-mbib) polymer chain into a 2D network. In 2 and 3, mpda(2- )and ppda(2-) ligands possess a cis-conformation and can be seen as a "V"-type building block, linking Ni(II) atoms to form a 1D loop-containing chain together with the mbib ligand. Utilizing the isomer bridging ligand pbib and a different metal ion, Co(II), instead of the mbib ligand and Ni(II) ion, 2D (4), 1D (5), and 2D (6) coordination polymers were obtained. The structural diversity of these complexes is mainly attributed to the different coordination modes and isomer conformations of flexible phenylenediacetic acids and the bis(imidazole) ligand. Furthermore, six Co(II)/Ni(II) coordination polymers could accelerate the degradation rate of methylene blue (MB) under visible light irradiation, especially complex 4. Complex 2 exhibited a high performance in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Results will provide an effective way to develop coordination polymers towards electrochemical applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				1466-8033		WOS:000620282700011

Implications for the classical Tafel analysis are evaluated at different combinations of film resistances and mass transport properties. We show that in some cases, linear Tafel-like voltammetric responses may result, which do not contain actual kinetic information and might therefore be misleading and cause of erroneous catalyst activity evaluation.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000575156800011

Nickelrich layered oxides suffer from high surface reactivity toward ambient air. Besides hydroxides, carbonates are known to be the major surface impurities formed. While the decomposition of Li2CO3 in a battery cell has been studied extensively, the mechanistic aspects of its decomposition during cell formation/cycling are still highly controversial.The decomposition reaction of Li2CO3 in a standard Li-ion battery electrolyte is studied by on-line electrochemical mass spectrometry, employing an electrode only consisting of Li2CO3 and conductive carbon. By modifying the electrode configurations in the cell, we are able to show that the decomposition of Li2CO3 occurs as a chemical process without any direct electrochemical oxidation of the Li2CO3 particles. Their decomposition proceeds by a chemical process via protons that are formed upon anodic oxidation of the electrolyte solvent and of trace impurities in alkyl carbonate based electrolytes. By adding common impurities in Li-ion battery electrolytes as ethanol and ethylene glycol, whose electrochemical oxidation at rather low anodic potentials (approximate to 3.5 V vs Lithorn/Li) results in the formation of protons, the onset of CO2 evolution from Li2CO3 is accordingly shifted to such low potentials. Tracing the proton-induced LiPF6 decomposition products PF5/POF3, the formation of protons can be followed quantitatively and a direct correlation with the CO2 produced by the proton-induced Li2CO3 decomposition is shown. Implications of these findings for transition metal oxide based cathode materials in Liion batteries are discussed based on the here found decomposition mechanism. (C) 2020 The Authors.

In the present work, homogeneous n/n junctioned g-C3N4/g-C3N4 is prepared by in situ annealing of two different precursors and its photocatalytic activity is studied for hydrogen generation. It exhibits a superior photocatalytic performance over its individual pure g-C3N4 moieties. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is explained by the synergistic effects between the two g-C3N4 in the homogeneous nanostructures, where a better charge separation is achieved in the homogeneous g-C3N4/g-C3N4 with many n/n junctions. Previously, synergistic effects were reported in the heterostructures of different materials or different phases. This study thus broadens the meaning of synergistic effects and demonstrates that synergistic effects can be obtained using the same materials of the same phase but made by different methods. Therefore, this finding is of general interest to the materials, chemistry, and renewable energy communities and will trigger a wide attention in the related research fields.									95	2	0	0	8	0	95			2398-4902			WOS:000422771900011

Partial decomposition of sulfamate with decreasing pH below ca. 2.5 degrades the properties of nickel electrodeposits, decreases the charge yield and results in spent solutions, from which nickel must be recovered before they could be discharged to sewers. Results are reported of charge yields for nickel recovery from an industrial sulfamate effluent, using an electrochemical reactor operated at constant current in batch-recycle mode and incorporating a nickel mesh cathode, a Ti/Ta2O5-IrO2 mesh anode and a cation-permeable membrane to prevent anodic oxidation of sulfamate. A micro-kinetic model was developed, treating the processes of nickel(II) and proton reduction in sulfamate solutions as two multi-step reactions involving adsorbed intermediates, Ni (ads) (I) and H-ads, respectively. The unknown kinetic parameters were obtained using gPROMS software by iterative fitting of the model to experimental data obtained over a range of nickel(II) concentrations and bulk solution pH, enabling evaluation of nickel(II) reduction charge yields as a function of nickel(II) concentration, bulk pH and electrode potential. A model combining the micro-kinetic equations with mass and charge balances on the reactor was used to determine the control parameters for electrochemical recovery of elemental metal from nickel(II) in batch-recycle mode. It was determined experimentally that a decrease in catholyte pH to values below ca. 2.5 resulted in a decrease in nickel(II) reduction charge yields to values below 0.9. The decrease in catholyte pH, caused by the flux of protons from the anolyte where they were generated via anodic oxygen evolution, was obviated by continuous addition of NaOH at a rate determined by the model, permitting nickel(II) recovery with an average charge yield of 0.94.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000308441300002		
J	Valchev, I; Nenkova, S; Simeonova, G; Gaidarov, J								Evolution in hardwood kraft pulp bleaching - A comparison of options								CELLULOSE CHEMISTRY AND TECHNOLOGY				39	1-2			105	114						JAN-APR 2005	2005	Optimization of the bleaching sequences' stages is imposed by the introduction of strict environmental requirements. It is considered that a prolonged reaction time and high temperature in the acid D-0 stage would assure a more effective carrying out of the next bleaching stages, as a result of improved hexenuronic acids' removal, and of a lower Kappa number. The question of optimal chemical distribution in the bleaching sequence, for obtaining pulp with high final brightness, strength properties and viscosity, is also under discussion. The present investigation studies the influence of the conditions in D stages, and the chemical distribution in the D-0 - EOP - D-1 sequence on bleached pulp's properties. Industrial, oxygen-delignified beech and poplar pulps were used; the ECF sequences were in compliance with the Svilosa Company options. It was found out that the conditions in the D-0 stage were essential for the bleaching processes in the next stages and for pulp properties' fort-nation. A prolonged hot D-0 stage resulted in pulp with more than a unit Kappa number reduction, as due to hexenuronic acid destruction. As a result, pulp brightness was up to 1.5 % higher in bleaching sequences with a high chlorine dioxide charge at the D-1 stage, yet unfavourable to pulp strength properties. The most optimal charge of chlorine dioxide was of 2.0-2.5 % in the D-0 stage, a minimal charge of this being recommended for use in the D-1 stage for attaining the desired, higher pH value. Short lower temperature D-0 bleaching resulted in pulp with equal brightness, but with better strength properties in comparison with the hot prolonged D-0 bleaching for this chemical distribution. Addition of hydrogen peroxide in the 0.25-0.75 % range in the EO stage led to significant chlorine dioxide saving, final brightness increases and improvement of some strength properties.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0576-9787			WOS:000229625300010

It is found that the EPR signal of the iron-nitrosyl complex changes upon addition of F-. The change is determined to be due to a superhyperfine interaction between the electronic spin (S = 3/2) and the fluorine nuclear spin (I = 1/2), indicating that both F- acid NO are bound to the same nonheme iron. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of simultaneous binding of both F- and NO to the same iron of a mononuclear nonheme protein. On the basis of an analysis of the hyperfine interaction, a cis F-Fe-NO coordination is indicated. Upon illumination of (NO, Cl-)- or (NO, F-)-treated PSII membranes at 200 K, new X-and Q-band EPR signals are observed in B(1)parallel to B and B(1)perpendicular to B modes. Quantitative simulations of these signals provide an unambiguous assignment to the iron-quinone complex, Q(A)(-){FeNO},(7) of the acceptor site of PSII. The exchange interaction between the iron-nitrosyl complex (S = 3/2) and the semiquinone Q(A)(-) radical (S = 1/2) is determined to be J = +0.5 cm(-1) (F-) and +1.3 cm(-1) (Cl-) for H-ex = JS(1)S(2). A distribution in the exchange coupling is required to satisfactorily simulate the EPR spectra. This distribution is correlated to small structural variations of the iron-quinone acceptor side of PSII.									7	0	0	0	5	0	7			0002-7863			WOS:000083009700020		
J	Koroleva, OY								Cold acclimation of the photosynthetic apparatus in an arctic species, Oxyria digyna								RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				43	3			319	324						MAY-JUN 1996	1996	The arctic-alpine plants, Oxyria digyna (L.) Hill., were acclimated to a temperature of 9 degrees C for 30 days and then compared with nonacclimated plants in terms of some photosynthetic indices as a function of temperature. Photosynthetic oxygen evolution in acclimated and nonacclimated plants exhibited almost identical changes with temperature in the range of 3-38 degrees C, Cold acclimation did not affect the optimum temperature for photosynthesis (28 degrees C). High nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence, q(N), was observed, indicating the formation of a large pH gradient in the thylakoids of intact leaves. The photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence, q(P) (quenching related to the activation the electron transport and the Calvin cycle), exhibited a temperature dependence resembling that of photosynthesis, It appears that the suppression of photosynthesis in O. digyna at suboptimal and supraoptimal temperatures is caused by the limited capacity of CO2 assimilation in the Calvin cycle rather than electron-transport constraints in the photosynthetic chain. Cold acclimation led to a large increase in the content of xanthophyll-cycle pigments known to protect chloroplasts from photodamage. The deepoxidation reaction, associated with the production of zeaxanthin, was suppressed at low temperatures in both acclimated and nonacclimated plants. However, comparatively large amounts of zeaxanthin were formed in cold-acclimated plants at temperatures ranging from 2.5 to 20 degrees C. Photosystem II was considerably less susceptible to photoinhibition in cold-acclimated plants than in unadapted plants. It is concluded that the increased operation of the xanthophyll cycle in cold-acclimated O. digyna plants might be important for stabilizing the photosynthetic apparatus in natural environments, where low temperature and high irradiance act in combination.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1021-4437			WOS:A1996UP89300006

This was done either by voltammetric cycling between +0.95 and -0.80 V (vs. Ag/AgCl/sat. KCl) or via a potential step technique in solutions containing colloidal platinum particles. A chloroplatinate medium with a citrate reducing/protection agent was employed for generating the colloids. An "electrotrapping" mechanism is proposed wherein the (negatively charged) platinum colloidal particles form a three-dimensional array within a growing polypyrrole matrix. The growth of the ppy/Pt films was studied by combined voltammetry-electrochemical quartz crystal microgravimetry. Quantitative analyses of these data afforded estimates of the platinum loading within the ppy matrix and the polymerization efficiency. The former are compared with assays via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The ppy/Pt films exhibited high catalytic activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and O2 reduction. The enhanced activity is attributed to the fine (nanometer-size range) dispersion of the platinum catalyst particles within the ppy matrix. Comparisons with bulk platinum and platinum electrodeposited on the surface of ppy films are provided. Thus, for the HER at a potential of -400 mV (vs. a saturated calomel electrode (SCE)), the ppy/Pt samples show comparable catalytic activity with bulk platinum and an order of magnitude rate enhancement relative to the surface platinum(0)/ppy case. Correspondingly, the rate enhancement does not saturate with increasing film thickness for our ppy/Pt samples. This behavior contrasts with that characteristic of surface-confined catalyst situations. That the platinum particles within the ppy matrix truly are in the catalytically useful nanometer range (less-than-or-equal-to 10 nm) is demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy data.									142	3	0	0	9	1	144			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:A1992JL28600018

According to the infrared dust features, the sample is divided among carbon-, oxygen-, and double-dust chemistry (CC, OC, and DC, respectively), providing an independent proxy for the nature of the PNe progenitors. Our AGB models, with diffusive overshooting from all the convective borders, nicely reproduce the O overabundances observed in CC PNe, indicating that they evolve from low-Z low-mass (similar to 1-3 M-circle dot) AGB stars. This indicates that O is not always a good indicator of the original ISM metallicity and that the O production by low-mass stars should be considered in galactic-evolution models. The lowest metallicity OC PNe evolve from low-mass (similar to 1 M-circle dot) O-rich AGBs, while the higher metallicity ones (all with uncertain dust classifications) display a chemical pattern similar to the DC PNe. In agreement with the recent literature, the DC PNe mostly descend from high-mass (M > 3.5 M-circle dot) solar/supersolar metallicity AGBs that experience hot bottom burning (HBB), but other formation channels in low-mass AGBs like extra mixing, stellar rotation, binary interaction, or He pre-enrichment cannot be disregarded until more accurate C/O ratios can be obtained. Two DC PNe show the imprint of advanced CNO processing and deep second dredge-up, suggesting progenitors masses close to the limit to evolve as core collapse supernovae (above 6 M-circle dot). Their actual C/O ratios, if confirmed, indicate contamination from the third dredge-up, rejecting the hypothesis that the chemical composition of such high-metallicity massive AGBs is modified exclusively by HBB.					323RD Symposium of the International-Astronomical-Union (IAU)323RD Symposium of the International-Astronomical-Union (IAU)	OCT 10-14, 2016OCT 10-14, 2016	Int Astron Union; Natl Nat Sci Fdn China; Natl Astron Observatories Chinese Acad Sci; Peking Univ; Int Astron Union Div H Interstellar Matter & Local Univ; Int Astron Union Div G Stars & Stellar Phys; Int Astron Union Div J Galaxies & Cosmol; Int Astron Union Commiss H3 Planetary Nebulae; Peking Univ, Sch PhysInt Astron Union; Natl Nat Sci Fdn China; Natl Astron Observatories Chinese Acad Sci; Peking Univ; Int Astron Union Div H Interstellar Matter & Local Univ; Int Astron Union Div G Stars & Stellar Phys; Int Astron Union Div J Galaxies & Cosmol; Int Astron Union Commiss H3 Planetary Nebulae; Peking Univ, Sch Phys	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINABeijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1743-9213	1743-9221	978-1-10716-991-3	WOS:000456283100015		
J	Xu, Yong; Zhang, Huangwei					Xu, Yong/0000-0002-7618-8279			撤稿声明: Pulsating propagation and extinction of hydrogen detonations in ultrafine water sprays								COMBUSTION AND FLAME				241						112086	10.1016/j.combustflame.2022.112086				JUL 2022	2022	Pulsating detonation and extinction in stoichiometric hydrogen/oxygen/argon gas with water sprays are studied for the first time. Eulerian-Lagrangian method is employed, and the emphasis is laid on characterization of the unsteady phenomena and evolutions of chemical / flow structures in pulsating propagation and extinction. Three detonation propagation modes are found: (1) pulsating propagation, (2) propagation followed by extinction, and (3) immediate extinction. For pulsating detonation, within one cycle, the propagation speeds and the distance between reaction front (RF) and shock front (SF) change periodically. The pulsating phenomenon originates from the interactions between gas dynamics, chemical kinetics, and droplet dynamics inside the induction zone. Multiple pressure waves are emanated from the RF within one cycle, which overtake and intensify the lead SF. An autoigniting spot arises in the shocked gas after the contact surface. The relative locations of SF, RF, shock-frame sonic point, and two-phase contact surface remain unchanged in a pulsating cycle, but their distances have periodic variations. Moreover, detonation extinction is featured by continuously increased distance between the RF and SF and quickly reduced pressure peaks, temperature, and combustion heat release. The decoupling of RF and SF leads to significantly increasing chemical timescale of the shocked mixture. The hydrodynamic structure also changes considerably when detonation extinction occurs. Moreover, the predicted map of detonation propagation and extinction illustrates that the critical mass loading for detonation extinction reduces significantly when the droplet size becomes smaller. It is also found that for the same droplet size, the average detonation speed monotonically decreases with water mass loading. However, detonation speed and pulsating frequency have a non-monotonic dependence on droplet size under a constant water mass loading. (C) 2022 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In the last decade, BCN structures have been extensively researched for many energy-related applications, from supercapacitors and lithium ion batteries to electrocatalysts and sensors. However, the stoichiometry dependent properties of BCN as well as the difficult-to-control domain distribution of boron, carbon, and nitrogen atoms throughout the planes result in challenges for the fabrication of devices with reproducible performance. This review starts by discussing the fundamental properties of BCN as compared to its parent compounds (hexagonal boron nitride and graphene). Then the fabrication methods are comprehensively reviewed, analyzing each method's advantages and shortcomings. This is followed by an explanation of BCN characteristics while particular attention is given to the surface chemistry and engineering of nanosheets. Applications of two dimensional BCN will also be reviewed to illustrate its significance over the last decade. Lastly, future trends and prospects of BCN structures will be reviewed, indicating on-going areas of research and the possible integration of BCN in semiconductor and energy-related applications.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2162-8769	2162-8777		WOS:000576086400001

This nucleosynthesis process, the r-process, is unique in the sense that a combination of nuclear physics far from stability (masses, half-lives, neutron-capture and photodisintegration, neutron-induced and beta-delayed fission and last but not least neutrino-nucleus interactions) is intimately linked to ejecta from astrophysical explosions (core collapse supernovae or other neutron star related events). The astrophysics and nuclear physics involved still harbor many uncertainties, either in the extrapolation of nuclear properties far beyond present experimental explorations or in the modeling of multidimensional, general relativistic (neutrino-radiation) hydrodynamics with rotation and possibly required magnetic fields. Observational clues about the working of the r-process are mostly obtained from solar abundances and from the abundance evolution of the heaviest elements as a function of galactic age, as witnessed in old extremely metal-poor stars. They contain information whether the r-process is identical for all stellar events, how abundance features develop with galactic time and whether the frequency of r-process events is comparable to that of average core collapse supernovae-producing oxygen through titanium, as well as iron-group nuclei. The theoretical modeling of the r-process has advanced from simple approaches, where the use of static neutron densities and temperatures can aid to test the influence of nuclear properties far from stability on abundance features, to more realistic expansions with a given entropy, global neutron/proton ratio and expansion time scales, as expected from explosive astrophysical events. The direct modeling in astrophysical events such as supernovae still faces the problem whether the required conditions can be met.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0218-3013	1793-6608		WOS:000251312800019

The Ir0.7Ta0.3O2 bottom layer serves as an Ohmic contact to facilitate electron transfer from semiconductor layers to the Ti base. The Co-TiO2 interlayer and overcoated Sb-SnO2 islands enhance the evolution of reactive chlorine. The surficial Sb-SnO2 islands also serve as the reactive sites for free radical generation. Experiments coupled with computational kinetic simulations show that while center dot OH and Cl center dot are initially produced on the SbSn/CoTi/Ir anode surface, the dominant radical formed in solution is the dichlorine radical anion, Cl-2(center dot-). The steadystate concentration of reactive radicals is 10 orders of magnitude lower than that of reactive chlorine. The SbSn/CoTi/Ir anode was applied to electrochemically treat human wastewater. These test results show that COD and NH4+ can be removed after 2 h of electrolysis with minimal energy consumption (370 kWh/kg COD and 383 kWh/kg NH4+). Although free radical species contribute to COD removal, anodes designed to enhance reactive chlorine production are more effective than those designed to enhance free radical production.									77	4	0	0	41	0	80			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000381654600041	27402194

However, it still suffers from low efficiency and serious hydrolysis in neutral pH electrolyte. Herein, NiCoAI layered double hydroxides (NiCoAl-LDH) is successfully in situ constructed onto hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) nanoarrays. The resulting NiCoAl-LDH/alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode exhibits an onset potential as low as 0.55 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a significantly enhanced photocurrent density of 2.56 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE for PEC water oxidation in neutral electrolyte, which is ca. 13, 2 and 1.4 times as high as that of alpha-Fe2O3, NiAl-LDH/alpha-Fe2O3 and CoAl-LDH/alpha-Fe2O3. Comprehensive electrochemical and structural analysis reveal the synergistic effect of Ni and Co should be responsible for the enhanced PEC performance. Ni and Co could cause local structure distortion of MO6 (M = Ni or Co) in NiCoAI-LDH, which (1) improve the conductivity of MA1-LDH, thus enhance the separation and the transfer of photogenerated charges and (2) slightly change the chemical environment of Co and Ni and facilitate the formation of low-valent oxidation states, thus lower the energy barrier of Co2+ or Ni2+ to high oxidation states and accelerate the kinetics of water oxidation. The versatile skeleton and interlayered anions as well as the thicker decoration of NiCoAI-LDH enable NiCoAl-LDH/alpha-Fe2O3 to possess excellent stability in neutral electrolyte. This work reveals the partial substitution of Co (or Ni) with Ni (or Co) in MAI-LDH could produce more efficient materials toward high PEC water splitting and will stimulate further development on ternary LDHs as excellent cocatalysts for other electrode in neutral electrolyte.

However, mechanistic knowledge of the oxidation and hydrogen pickup mechanisms is still lacking. In an effort to develop such knowledge, we conducted a comprehensive study that included detailed experiments combined with oxidation modeling. We review this set of results conducted on zirconium alloys herein and articulate them into a unified corrosion theoretical framework. First, the hydrogen pickup fraction (f(H)) was accurately measured for a specific set of alloys specially designed to determine the effects of alloying elements, microstructure, and corrosion kinetics on f(H). We observed that f(H) was not constant and increased until the kinetic transition and decreased at the transition. f(H) depended on the alloy and was lower for niobium-containing alloys. These results led us to hypothesize that hydrogen pickup during corrosion results from the need to balance the charge during the corrosion reaction such that f(H) decreases when the rate of electron transport through the protective oxide increases. To assess this hypothesis, two experiments were performed: (1) micro-X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (mu-XANES) to investigate the evolution of the oxidation state of alloying elements when incorporated in the growing oxide and (2) in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to measure oxide resistivity as a function of exposure time on different alloys. With the use of these results, we developed an analytical zirconium alloy corrosion model based on the coupling of oxygen vacancies and electron currents. Both modeling and EIS results show that as the oxide electric conductivity decreases the f(H) increases. These new results support the general hypothesis of charge balance. The model quantitatively and qualitatively predicts the differences observed in oxidation kinetics and hydrogen pickup fraction between different alloys.					18th International Symposium on Zirconium in the Nuclear Industry18th International Symposium on Zirconium in the Nuclear Industry	MAY 15-19, 2016MAY 15-19, 2016	ASTM Int Comm B10 React & Refract Met & Alloys; ASTM Subcomm B10 02 Zirconium & HafniumASTM Int Comm B10 React & Refract Met & Alloys; ASTM Subcomm B10 02 Zirconium & Hafnium	Hilton Head, SCHilton Head, SC	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0066-0558		978-0-8031-7641-6	WOS:000434240000011

B	Mansell, J.M.								On the Performance Potential of Bioelectrochemical Life Support Systems								43rd International Conference on Environmental Systems								15 pp.	15 pp.						2013	2013	An area of growing multi-disciplinary research and revolutionary development for bioprocessing on Earth is bioelectrochemical systems. These systems exploit the capability of many microorganisms to act as biocatalysts, enhancing the performance of electrochemical processes which convert low-value materials into valuable products. Many varieties of such processes hold potential value for space exploration as means to recycle metabolic waste and other undesirable materials or in situ resources into oxygen, water, and other valuable substances. However, the wide range of possible reactants, products, configurations, and operating parameters, along with the early stage of development and application on the ground necessitate thorough consideration of which, if any, possibility(ies) could outperform existing technologies and should thus receive investment for space applications. In turn, the decision depends on the theoretical and practical limits of performance and the value of the reactant-product conversions within spaceflight scenarios, and should, to the greatest extent possible, be examined from the perspective of a fully designed, integrated system, rather than as an isolated unit lacking critical components like valves and pumps. Herein, we select a series of possible reactant-product conversions, develop concept process flow diagrams for each, and estimate theoretical and (where sufficient literature data allows) practical performance limitations of each. The objective was to estimate the costs, benefits, and risks of each concept in order to aid strategic decisions in the early-phase technology development effort.					43rd International Conference on Environmental Systems43rd International Conference on Environmental Systems	14-18 July 201314-18 July 2013		Vail, CO, USAVail, CO, USA	0	0	0		0	0	0					978-1-62410-215-8	INSPEC:14034944

The obtained electrode (beta-Ni(OH)(2)/Ni-foam) is characterized by X-ray diffractometry, scanning and transmission electron microscopy and thermal analysis. Results show that Ni(OH)(2) has a beta-phase structure and presents on the nickel foam skeleton mostly as spherical clusters with a diameter of similar to 10 mu m. The spheres are composed of nanosheets with thickness of similar to 60 nm, width of 230 nm and length up to similar to 2 mu m, and the nanosheets are assembled by nanoparticles with diameter of 20 nm. The electrochemical performance of the beta-Ni(OH)(2)/Ni-foam electrode is evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests. The difference between the oxygen evolution reaction onset potential and the anodic peak potential for this electrode (similar to 100 mV) is larger than that for beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets and nanotubes powder electrode (similar to 65-77 mV) and much larger than that for commercial spherical beta-Ni(OH)(2) powder electrode (similar to 25-47 mV), indicating that the beta-Ni(OH)(2)/Ni-foam electrode can be fully charged. The specific discharge capacity of beta-Ni(OH)(2) in the beta-Ni(OH)(2)/Ni-foam electrode reaches 275 mAh g(-1), which is close to the theoretical value, lower than that of beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanotubes (315 mAh g(-1)), but higher than that of nanosheets (219.5 mAh g(-1)), commercial micrometer grade spherical powders (265 mAh g(-1)) and microtubes (232.4 mAh g(-1)).

The detailed characterization of the films by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray (SEM/EDX) spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis proved the high crystallinity and phase purity of the nanosized metallic palladium films without the evolution of any elemental impurities from the precursor compound. The as prepared electrodes were used for nonenzymatic amperometric H2O2 detection via electrochemical reduction. The LOD was 40.8 nM with a high sensitivity of 760.84 mu A/(mu M cm(2)). From the experimental scan rate variation analysis, the reduction of H2O2 on the PdNP-ITO electrode surface was determined to be adsorption controlled. For this process of adsorption, we calculated the number of electrons involved during adsorption (n), the charge transfer coefficient (alpha), and, finally, the rate constant (k(s)). The process of adsorption of H2O2 on each of the characteristic metallic planes was further studied via Monte Carlo simulations (MCSs). We accounted for both molecular O-2 and H2O during the simulations to understand the effects of oxygen and solvent on adsorption since all experiments were conducted in an air-saturated solution. Several numbers of the adsorbate-metal substrate configurations were obtained for the simulations on each crystalline Pd plane, confirming the firm adsorption of H2O2 in the presence of O-2 and H2O.

Despite the undeniable potential of such an approach, no similar study had been done in Angola, the fourth largest diamond producer in Africa. Here we present the first work of in situ U-Pb geochronology and Sr-Nd isotope analyses of perovsldte in six Angolan kimberlites, supported by a detailed petrographic and geochemical study of their perovskite populations. Four types of perovskite were identified, differing in texture, major- and trace-element composition, zoning patterns, type of alteration and the presence or absence of inclusions. Primary groundmass perovskite is classified either as anhedral, Na-, Nb- and LREE-poor perovskite (Ia); or euhedral, strongly zoned, Na-, Nb- and LREE-rich perovskite (Ib). Secondary perovskite occurs as reaction rims on ilmenite (ha) or as high Nb (up to 10.6 wt% Nb2O5) perovskite rims on primary perovskite (IIb). The occurrence of these four types within the Mulepe kimberlites is interpreted as an evidence of a complex, multi -stage process that involved mingling of compositionally different melts.U-Pb dating of these perovskites yielded Lower Cretaceous ages for four of the studied kimberlites: Mulepe 1 (116.2 +/- 6.5 Ma), Mulepe 2 (123.0 +/- 3.6 Ma), Calonda (119.5 +/- 4.3 Ma) and Cat115 (133 +/- 10 Ma). Kimberlite magmatism occurred in NE Angola likely due to reactivation of deep-seated translithospheric faults (>300 km) during the break-up of Gondwana. Sr-Ncl isotope analyses of four of these kimberlites indicate that they are Group I kimberlites, which is consistent with the petrological observations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In order to understand the effect of composition on catalytic activity and sulfur tolerance of anode catalysts, La0.75Sr0.25Cr1-xMnxO3+or-delta (noted as LSCM, x = 0.2, 0.5, 0.8) series were synthesized and characterized by XRD, XPS and H2-TPR. The results demonstrate that LSCM55 with moderate Mn-substitution content has the highest activity for H2S, which is attributed to considerable reducibility of Mn4+ determined by H2-TPR. XRD patterns reveal that as-synthesized samples with different Mn-substitution contents have different sulfur tolerance. Sr 3d5/2, Cr 2p3/2, Mn 2p3/2 regions of XPS for samples with different Mn-substitution contents imply that dominance of Mn4+, responsible for the catalytic activity, is the consequence of the interactions between cations at A-site and B-site. On the other hand, evolution of Mn in H2S atmosphere indicates Mn3+ in Mn4+-O-Mn3+ clusters contributes greatly to the sulfur tolerance of LSCM. By analyzing consistency in the contents of lattice oxygen, S species (mainly sulfate) and Mn3+, a hypothetical mechanism of LSCM catalysts involving catalysis and sulfur tolerance was proposed.

J	Esfahani, Ehsan Banayan; Mohseni, Madjid								Fluence-based photo-reductive decomposition of PFAS using vacuum UV (VUV) irradiation: Effects of key parameters and decomposition mechanism								JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING				10	1					107050	10.1016/j.jece.2021.107050				FEB 2022	2022	PFAS are a group of anthropogenic chemicals capturing global attention due to their numerous applications, ubiquitous detection, and toxicity. PFOS, a well-known compound of this class, is the most frequently detected PFAS in drinking water and human blood samples of several countries. In this study, a fluence-based approach using well-controlled quasi-collimated beam of UV (254 nm) and UV/VUV (254/185 nm) irradiations was followed to investigate the photodegradation of PFOS. Very low epsilon(nm)(185) of PFOS, 57.2 +/- 6.4 M-1 cm(-1), implied the negligible contribution of direct photolysis in its decomposition, whereas the use of different scavengers indicated the prominent role of e(aq)(-). Compared with other photo-reductive mediators, the addition of sulfite led to greater decomposition of PFOS which favored both UV and UV/VUV processes. Greater molar absorption coefficient and quantum yield of sulfite photolysis in 185 nm rather than corresponding values in 254 nm resulted in greater decomposition of PFOS in UV/VUV/sulfite process. Fluence-based decomposition rates of PFOS isomers (branched: 2.044 +/- 0.336 J(-1) cm(2) and linear: 0.053 +/- 0.003 J(-1) cm(2)) were independent of fluence rate, while time-based rates were directly dependent on the fluence rate. Besides, the effects of key parameters including sulfite dosage, solution pH, temperature, initial concentration of PFOS, and dissolved oxygen were investigated. Defluorination and mass spectrometry results showed faster evolution of intermediates, i.e., their formation and consequent degradation, in the UV/VUV/sulfite process compared with the UV/sulfite process. H/F exchange with consequent C-C bond scission, along with desulfonation with consequent PFCAs formation are proposed decomposition pathways of PFOS upon reaction with e(aq)(-).									3	0	0	0	1	0	4			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000765953300003

The important role and fractionation of amphibole in continental arc magmatic systems is well documented even if amphibole is generally absent as a prevalent phenocrystic phase in erupted, differentiated lavas. This study presents a comprehensive textural and geochemical investigation of rare plagioclase-bearing hornblendite cumulates entrained in c. 1.4 Ma (trachy-)andesites at the Quillacas monogenetic center on the Bolivian Altiplano, Central Andes. MicroXRF mapping and imaging via SEM-EDS dearly reveals their mesocumulate, idiomorphic nature characterized by cumulus hornblende (>= 90%) with intercumulus sodic plagioclase (similar to 8%), minor Fe-Ti oxides and accessory apatites. The trace element compositions of cumulus amphiboles are consistent with their crystallization from a silicate melt with (La/Yb)(N) < 5 and low (Pb/Ce)(N) at <0.6. Amphibole TiO2 contents imply crystallization between 700 and 764 degrees C consistent with depths in the arc crust of 50-55 km as constrained by the Central Andean geotherm. Bulk hornblendite isotopic signatures (Sr-Nd-Pb) correspond to compositions associated with the Central Andean mid-tower arc crust consistent with the presence of hornblendite cumulate piles at this depth. Intercumulus (titano)magnetite exhibits oxy-exsolution ilmenite lamellae, the formation of which is associated with oxygen fugacity (fO2) increase during magmatic cooling and differentiation. The ubiquitous presence of gabbroic dehydration (reaction) rims (20-40 mu m in width) on the amphiboles is interpreted to be the result of a decrease in fO2 during ascent. The hornblendite mesocumulates from this study validate the extensive "cryptic" fractionation of amphibole at arcs and its important role on the petrogenesis of (continental) arc magmas.

J	Menchon, Silvia A.								Acid-mediated tumor invasion as a function of nutrient source location								PHYSICAL REVIEW E				100	2					022417	10.1103/PhysRevE.100.022417				AUG 29 2019	2019	Cancer cells have an altered metabolism that increases acid production driving to an extracellular pH significantly lower than normal. This leads to normal cell death, and extracellular matrix degradation allowing the formation of an interstitial gap between cancer and healthy cells. In this work, we present a mathematical model to study the interstitial gap formation and evolution considering a tissue with a non-uniform nutrient distribution. Our results indicate that the interstitial gap onsets at the region with highest nutrient consumption. Due to the gap formation, cancer cells near the interface have more nutrient and space availability. This induces cancer cell reproduction and migration toward the nutrient source. Our simulations suggest a strong correlation between gap size and the distance to the nutrient source. Although we do not find a correlation between tumor growth speed and gap size, our results indicate a high risk of metastasis for tumors that develop an interstitial gap, emphasizing the importance of gap detection as a hallmark for cancer invasion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000483047600004	31574690

Submonolayer oxidation starts well below bulk silver oxide formation at potential about -0.6 V vs. Hg/HgO electrode at pH 11. Two potential-dependent Raman bands nu(1) at 540 to 560 cm(-1) and nu(2) at 803 to 819 cm(-1) in basic NaF electrolytes are attributed to Ag-OH stretching and AgO-H bending vibrations of electrochemisorbed hydroxide species. Strong isotope effect is observed in D2O solutions, nu(2) being shifted to values of 550 to 570 cm(-1). Fluoride stabilizes the adsorption of hydroxide species. A multistep scheme is proposed that describes the mechanism of formation of hydroxide/oxide species at the considered silver-electrode surface.

First, mats of titanium dioxide nanorods have been synthesized at the surface of FTO/glass substrates from a solution of titanium (IV) n-butoxide. Then the mats have been calcined at 350 degrees C to remove structural defects which act as recombining sites during photoelectrochemical (PEC) experiments. The average diameter of individual TiO2 nanorods measured on c-TDNR is 190 nm. Then, nickel hydroxide has been electrodeposited by cyclic voltammetry from a pH-neutral aqueous solution of nickel nitrate. Then the hydroxide has been chemically transformed into a MOF of nickel and BDC, using a solvothermal treatment at 450 degrees C. A 50 nm thick layer of Ni-BDC MOF was thus deposited at the surface of c-TiO2 nanorods. The resulting photoelectrodes have been characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, XPS, FTIR and UV-Vis. absorption spectroscopy. They have been used as photoanodes to perform PEC water splitting experiments. The NiMOF was found to play the double role of surface photosensitizer (with a photoactivity mainly in the UV + Vis. range) and electrocatalyst. An overall current density of 4.48 mA cm(-2) was measured at room temperature under UV + Vis irradiation at 100 mW cm(-2) , and a current density of 3.08 mA cm(-2) was measured under dark condition. The calcination of TDNRs and the addition of the nickel MOF were both found to be significantly beneficial. The combination of photoactivity and electroactivity is interesting in view of photo-assisted water electrolysis applications. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Wacker oxidation provides a broadly useful strategy to convert the mineral oil into higher value-added carbonyl chemicals. However, the conventional Wacker chemistry remains problematic, such as the poor activity for internal alkenes, the lack of anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity, and the high cost and chemical waste resulted from noble metal catalysts and stoichiometric oxidant. Here, we describe an unprecedented dehydrogenative oxygenation of beta-alkyl styrenes and their derivatives with water under external-oxidant-free conditions by utilizing the synergistic effect of photo catalysis and proton-reduction catalysis that can address these challenges. This dual catalytic system possesses the single anti-Markovnikov selectivity due to the property of the visible-light-induced alkene radical cation intermediate.									112	11	0	0	21	0	114			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000384037400009	27595272

Hypp is essential for the viability for yeast cells, where two forms are encoded by the genes HYP1 and HYP2. The hypusine-containing protein Hyp2p, encoded by the HYP2 gene in yeast, is present under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, whereas Hyp1p synthesis is restricted to anaerobiosis. hyp1 disruption mutants grown under anaerobic conditions reveal no detectable alteration in phenotype relative to wild-type strains. We demonstrate that either Hyp1p or Hyp2p alone is sufficient for normal growth under both metabolic conditions. Moreover, Hypp from various eukaryotic species (slime mold, alfalfa and man) carries the lysine to hypusine modification when expressed in yeast and can substitute functionally for Hyp2p in strains disrupted for HYP2, indicating a highly conserved function of this protein. In contrast, the archaebacterial Hypp expressed in yeast is neither modified by hypusine, nor does it allow growth of cells deficient for yeast Hypp.									35	1	0	0	34	0	37			0026-8925			WOS:A1994PL42500010	7969034

The use of electrolytes was to enable the monitoring of photoactivity changes as a result of the expected impact on the population of hydroxyl groups on the surface. The assumption turned out to be correct and it was proved that the presence of Li+, Na+ or K+ does not allow achieving the same increases in photoactivity as observed for water. Modified samples exhibit significantly decreased F, P and carbon containing species. The length of the HA annealing time considerably affected the geometry of the nanotubes: eliminated clusters, changing the tilting angle of nanotubes, the wall thickness and inter-nanotube distance. Morphology changes due to HA treatment were associated with the interference phenomenon recorded as maximum in the Vis range. HA treatment in water brings about the most photoactive and photoelectroactive material characterized with minor modification in the optical bandgap and position of the flat bad potential. The optical energy bandgap values for electrodes containing alkali metals were reduced (up to 2.72 eV) and flat-band potential was shifted towards the anodic direction (up to 0.25 V disparity). However, increased activity as photocatalysts in the methylene blue degradation process and higher photocurrent generation was achieved for samples after modification in distilled water than in electrolytes, but these parameters are still better in comparison to unmodified titania nanotubes. Long-term treatment in water and electrolytes reduced threshold potentials for oxygen evolution reaction. The studies confirmed the effectiveness of the hydrothermal method for obtaining better photocatalytic parameters of TiO2-NTs and indicate that the presence of alkali metals is not favourable for maintaining high photocatalytic parameters.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000863271100007

Among these samples, La0.7Sr0.3Mn0.85Fe0.15O3 showed better catalytic activity than the samples with undoped and other doped ones, so undoped iron La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 and doped iron La0.7Sr0.3Mn0.85Fe0.15O3 were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Vis diffuse reflection analysis (UV-Vis DRS), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), specific surface analysis (BET), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In addition, it takes methyl orange (MO) as the object of degradation, and the photocatalysis, Fenton-like reaction, and their synergistic catalytic effects as well as the catalytic mechanisms of La0.7Sr0.3Mn0.85Fe0.15O3 have been studied. The results show that La0.7Sr0.3Mn0.85Fe0.15O3 exhibits high solar-driven photocatalytic and Fenton-like catalytic activities for MO degradation. Moreover, there is an obvious synergistic catalytic effect of photocatalysis and Fenton-like catalytic activity. In addition, according to the free radical capture experiment, the hole, center dot OH and center dot O-2(-) are the active substances in the synergistic catalytic process. The possible synergistic catalytic mechanism of La0.7Sr0.3Mn0.85Fe0.15O3 was also proposed. And the average pore size of the catalyst is 20.91 nm by BET. The near-superparamagnetic properties of La(0.7)Sr(0.3)Mn(0.85)Fe(0.15)O(3 )enable it to achieve simple separation in an external magnetic field, avoiding the disadvantages of ordinary catalysts that are difficult to separate. Therefore, La0.7Sr0.3Mn0.85Fe0.15O3 is an advanced multifunctional nanocatalyst and could be widely used in the field of wastewater treatment.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000696817100001

Sensitization from exogenous and endogenous compounds that strongly enhance the frequency of light-induced lesions also plays an important role. The experimental determination of DNA lesions, though a difficult subject, is somehow well established and allows to elucidate even extremely rare DNA lesions. In parallel, molecular modeling has become fundamental to clearly understand the fine mechanisms related to DNA defects induction. Indeed, it offers an unprecedented possibility to get access to an atomistic or even electronic resolution. Ab initio molecular dynamics may also describe the time-evolution of the molecular system and its reactivity. Yet the modeling of DNA (photo-)reactions does necessitate elaborate multi-scale methodologies to tackle a damage induction reactivity that takes place in a complex environment. The double-stranded DNA environment is first characterized by a very high flexibility, but also a strongly inhomogeneous electrostatic embedding. Additionally, one aims at capturing more subtle effects, such as the sequence selectivity which is of critical important for DNA damage. The structure and dynamics of the DNA/sensitizers complexes, as well as the photo-induced electron- and energy-transfer phenomena taking place upon sensitization, should be carefully modeled. Finally the factors inducing different repair ratios for different lesions should also be rationalized. In this review we will critically analyze the different computational strategies used to model DNA lesions. A clear picture of the complex interplay between reactivity and structural factors will be sketched. The use of proper multi-scale modeling leads to the in-depth comprehension of DNA lesions mechanisms and also to the rational design of new chemo-therapeutic agents.									45	0	0	0	16	0	45			2296-2646			WOS:000373363100001	26236706

It was designed to measure the cross sections of several key nuclear reactions involved in stellar evolution. In particular, a study of the rate of formation of oxygen and carbon during the process of helium burning will be performed by exposing the chamber gas to intense nearly mono-energetic gamma-ray beams at the High Intensity Gamma Source (HI gamma S) facility. The O-TPC has a sensitive target-drift volume of 30x30x21 cm(3). Ionization electrons drift towards a double parallel-grid avalanche multiplier, yielding charge multiplication and light emission. Avalanche-induced photons from N-2 emission are collected, intensified and recorded with a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) camera, providing two-dimensional track images. The event's time projection (third coordinate) and the deposited energy are recorded by photomultipliers and by the TPC charge-signal, respectively. A dedicated VME-based data acquisition system and associated data analysis tools were developed to record and analyze these data.The O-TPC has been tested and calibrated with 3.183MeV alpha-particles emitted by a Gd-148 source placed within its volume with a measured energy resolution of 3.0%. Tracks of alpha and C-12 particles from the dissociation of O-16 and of three alpha-particles from the dissociation of C-12 have been measured during initial in-beam test experiments performed at the HI g S facility at Duke University. The full detection system and its performance are described and the results of the preliminary in-beam test experiments are reported.									42	0	0	0	1	0	42			1748-0221			WOS:000287858300061

The key challenges facing the usage of 2D c-MOPs as electrocatalysts are the need for rational design and synthesis methods for coordination polymers as well as an in-depth understanding of structure-activity relationships. Herein, we summarize the design principles, synthesis methods, conductive mechanisms, and catalytic behaviors of 2D c-MOPs. The large d-pi conjugation network and strong pi-pi stacking are responsible for the high conductivity of 2D c-MOPs. The coordination environment and electronic configuration of metal centers are decisive factors affecting the catalytic properties of 2D c-MOPs. This review provides insights into the preparation of 2D conductive c-MOP materials via modulation and optimization of active sites to enable high performance in electrochemical energy conversion systems.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2451-9294			WOS:000841999200007

ECO degradation kinetics decreased as carbon length decreased in single solute systems. Because heterogeneous catalysis involves PFAS interacting at the electrode surface, the impact of PFAS in solution on altering the potential affinity for PFAS itself on the surface was quantified. The BDD electrode surface wettability, defined by the surface contact angle, increased with longer chain length and diminished with increasing PFAS concentration. PFASs with a sulfonated head group degraded 2-3x faster than their carboxylic counterparts. Industrial wastewaters can have high background organic concentrations and have a large pH range prior to discharge, offering different opportunities to treat for PFAS near the semiconductor manufacturing tool or prior to pH adjustment and discharge to sanitary sewers. Increasing pH (up to 12) decreased the evolution of reactive oxygen species on the electrode surface and therefore decreased removal kinetics compared to pH 3 and 7. The presence of surfactants (tetramethylammonium hydroxide [TMAH] and sodium dodecyl sulfonate [SDS]) in the wastewater significantly reduced the degradation efficiency of ECO. However, compared to single-solute PFAS systems, multi-solute solutions (mixture of 6 PFASs) had higher degradation rates during ECO. In a real wastewater (originated from RO concentrate), PFASs were efficiently removed in ~320 min reaction time. These results demonstrated the promise for ECO to treat PFAS contained in industrial manufacturing processes at both tool level and blended wastewater.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000789171400001

We have studied the effect of various potential fluctuations, by simulating practical operating conditions derived from the use of solar and wind powers. The durability of IrO2 and the corresponding degradation mechanism were studied in order to suggest an appropriate durability protocol. We have found that relatively slow fluctuation without cycling back to the low potential like 0 V leads to serious degradation of IrO2 catalyst. We have also investigated degradation mechanism of IrO2 and have found that IrO2 is further oxidized to IrO2(OH) above 1.8 V, and then IrO2(OH) is converted into soluble Ir(OH)(3) or Ir2O3 species, leading to loss of IrO2 electrocatalyst.					18th Symposium on Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells and Electrolyzers (PEFC and E) held during the AiMES Meeting / ECS and SMEQ Joint International Meeting18th Symposium on Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells and Electrolyzers (PEFC and E) held during the AiMES Meeting / ECS and SMEQ Joint International Meeting	SEP 30-OCT 04, 2018SEP 30-OCT 04, 2018	Electrochem Soc, Phys & Analyt Electrochemistry Div; SMEQ; AiMES; Army Res Off; Off Naval Res; Electrochem Soc, Ind Electrochemistry & Electrochem Engn Div; Electrochem Soc, Energy Technol Div; Electrochem Soc, Battery DivElectrochem Soc, Phys & Analyt Electrochemistry Div; SMEQ; AiMES; Army Res Off; Off Naval Res; Electrochem Soc, Ind Electrochemistry & Electrochem Engn Div; Electrochem Soc, Energy Technol Div; Electrochem Soc, Battery Div	Cancun, MEXICOCancun, MEXICO	2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1938-5862	1938-6737	978-1-60768-860-0	WOS:000542035400072

The degradation of 10 dm(3) of solutions of the heterocyclic antibiotic erythromycin (ERY) in 0.050 mol dm(-3) Na2SO4 at pH 3.0 was used for validation. The filter-press reactor contained a platinized titanium plate anode and a graphite-felt cathode that produced H2O2 from the reduction of dissolved oxygen (0.24 mmol dm(-3)). Trials were performed under potentiostatic and galvanostatic conditions with predominance of H2O2 production, minimizing H-2 evolution reaction. The effect of initial catalyst (Fe2+) concentration, current density (j), initial antibiotic concentration as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and volumetric flow rate on the ERY mineralization was studied. Good agreement between simulations and experimental DOC decays was obtained. Mineralization current efficiencies and specific energy consumptions were also determined. The best performance under galvanostatic conditions was found for 0.225 mmol dm(-3) ERY (100 mg dm(-3) DOC), 0.50 mmol dm(-3) Fe2+, volumetric flow rate of 3.0 dm(3) min(-1) and j(cath) = -0.16 mA cm(-2), reaching 69% mineralization with current efficiency of 75% and specific energy consumption of 0.059 kWh (g DOC)(-1). Six organic by-products were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, whereas final short-chain carboxylic acids like formic and oxalic acid were detected by ion-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography. The initial N atom of ERY was predominantly converted into NO3- ion, although NH4+ ion was formed as well. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis of the voltammetric curves, showed, irrespective of EDTA concentration, the presence of a well defined pre-bulk region (region peak c(0)), where the Zn underpotential deposition (UPD), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and reduction of iron oxide compete, which was followed by region of peak c(1), where Zn bulk electrodeposition (overpotential deposition (OPD)) occurred. AFM and XRF analysis of Zn electrodeposit on 1010 steel substrate produced voltammetrically in the region of peak c(0) showed presence of Zn. These results corroborate those obtained by cyclic voltammetry, i.e., that Zn UPD occurred in the region of peak c(0). The morphological, structural and the chemical composition characterization of the Zn electrodeposits prepared potentiostatically at -1.60V, were performed by SEM, XRD and EDS, respectively. SEM images showed that the size of Zn crystallites produced at deposition charge densities (q(d)) of 2.0 C cm(-2) and 10.0 C cm(-2) decreased in the presence of EDTA, except at 0.20 M EDTA and q(d) 10.0 C cm(-2). EDS analysis showed that incorporation of oxygen in the electrodeposits depended on both q(d) and EDTA concentration. XRD patterns of the electrodeposits produced indicated only phase of pure Zn, with various reflections, irrespective the presence of EDTA and q(d). These electrodeposits exhibited crystallites preferentially oriented parallel to the (0 0 2) plane. Although EDTA led to morphological and chemical composition changes, it did not produce significant micro-structural changes, which could lead to different crystallographic orientations.

Under immersion conditions, the Pt-enriched layer formed on Pt-50-Co-50 and Pt-40-Co-60 alloys suppresses further dissolution of Co. Potential cycling between 0 and 1.4 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode enhances the selective dissolution, but is suppressed in the initial stage. In contrast, the amount of selective dissolution of Co from Pt-30-Co-70 increases linearly with time during the immersion. Potential cycling significantly accelerates the selective dissolution of Pt-30-Co-70. The selective dissolution mechanism of Pt-Co alloys is discussed in this paper. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Tailoring crystallinity of 2D cobalt phosphate to introduce pseudocapacitive behavior								JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE				54						105371	10.1016/j.est.2022.105371				OCT 2022	2022	The latest technological developments have catalyzed the quest for efficient electrochemical energy storage devices. Tailoring the properties of the electrode materials, such as porosity, crystallinity, electrochemical surface area, etc., can enhance the performance of electrochemical energy devices. Herein, the sonochemical synthesis of cobalt phosphate (Co-3(PO4)(2)) followed by calcination at various temperatures (at 200, 400, 600, and 800 degrees C) is reported. The effect phase transformation of Co-3(PO4)(2) at various calcination temperatures on its electrochemical performance is evaluated. The prepared Co-3(PO4)(2) samples were characterized by analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), field emission scanning electrons microscopy (FESEM), and energydispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The FESEM results showed morphological changes when Co-3(PO4)(2) is calcined at 200, 400, 600, and 800 degrees C. XRD pattern revealed the phase transformations from crystalline to amorphous and then again crystalline due to the loss of water molecules from the crystal structure Co-3(PO4)(2). The EDS provided the elemental analysis and confirmed the high purity of the samples under investigation. The change in electrochemical behavior of the prepared samples was examined in a three-electrode cell using 1 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) electrolyte using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The Co-3(PO4)(2) calcined at 200 degrees C demonstrated excellent electrochemical performance, giving a specific capacity of 352.00 C.g(-1), selected for the fabrication of supercapattery. The fabricated supercapattery Co-3(PO4)(2):@200 degrees C//AC) produced 51.95 Wh.kg(-1) energy density corresponding to the power density of 346.00 W.kg(-1) at a current density of 1.0 A g(-1).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2352-152X	2352-1538		WOS:000855254000004

These chemical species interact with unsaturated fatty acids of membrane lipids, triggering an autocatalytic chain reaction, producing lipid hydroperoxides (LOOHs) as the first relatively stable product of the ROS-mediated lipid peroxidation (LPO) process. Numerous biophysical and computational studies have been carried out to elucidate the LPO impact on the structure and organization of lipid membranes. However, although LOOHs are the major primary product of LPO of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), to the best of our knowledge, there is no experimental evidence on the effects of the accumulation of these LPO byproducts on the electrical properties and the underlying dynamics of lipid membranes. In this work, bilayer lipid membranes (BLMs) containing 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocoline (POPC) with increasing hydroperoxidized POPC (POPC-OOH) molar proportions (BLMPC/PC-OOH) are used as model membranes to investigate the effect of LOOH-mediated LPO propagation on the electrical behavior of lipid bilayers. Voltage-induced ion current signals are analyzed by applying the fractal method of power spectrum density (PSD) analysis. We experimentally prove that, when certain LOOH concentration and energy threshold are overcome, oxidized membranes evolve toward a critical state characterized by the emergence of non-linear electrical behavior dynamics and the pore-type metastable structures formation. PSD analysis shows that temporal dynamics exhibiting "white" noise (non-time correlations) reflects a linear relationship between the input and output signals, while long-term correlations (beta > 0.5) begin to be observed closely to the transition (critical point) from linear (Ohmic) to nonlinear (non-Ohmic) behavior. The generation of lipid pores appears to arise as an optimized energy dissipation mechanism based on the system's ability to self-organize and generate ordered structures capable of dissipating energy gradients more efficiently under stressful oxidative conditions.									7	0	0	0	3	0	7			0743-7463			WOS:000558755200022	32643942

The present work investigates in detail the growth of Ag nanoparticles deposited by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD), from triethylphosphine(6,6,7,7,8,8,8-heptafluoro-2,2-dimethy1-3,5-octanedionate)silver(I) [Ag(fod)(PEt3)-C16H25AgF7O2P] as the Ag precursor and H-2 as the reducing agent. The uniformity of the deposition in terms of nanoparticle morphology and chemical composition over a large surface area (8 in.) is analyzed using an original method. For all morphological, crystallographic, and chemical quantities, we report both the value at the center position and more originally, the gradient over a 10 cm distance on the substrate. The evolution of the gradient provides significant information on the growth mechanism. An effective growth rate of 0.020 +/- 0.003 nm/cycle at 130 degrees C determined by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy is found uniformly over the whole 8-inch area of the sample. According to X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy performed on the whole silicon wafer, the deposited material is made of polycrystalline pure metallic Ag, with a low amount of impurities emanating from the precursor, showing the completeness of the reduction reaction. Under self-limiting conditions, the effects of the chamber temperature and cycle number on the morphology of Ag nanoparticles deposited on silicon are analyzed. The results suggests that the Ag thin films mainly evolve following a material transfer. Two potential mechanisms are in competition: the migration of the particles and their further coalescence through the Volmer-Weber growth mode or a "surface Ostwald ripening"-like process. Under certain conditions, this last mechanism could explain the nonuniformity of the deposition.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000495772100051

The results demonstrated a dual role of azo dye worked as both a nitrogen resource and pore-forming agent.

In this perspective, we provide the thermodynamic framework for understanding all such future applications of closed bipolar electrochemistry in a 4-electrode configuration. We distinguish the differences between open and closed bipolar electrochemical cells. In particular, the use of the 4-electrode configuration in both open and closed bipolar electrochemical cells with immiscible aqueous-organic solutions is outlined. A comprehensive overview of the influence of external bias on the thermodynamics underpinning electron transfer from an organic redox couple to an aqueous redox couple, or vice versa, by electrons flowing along a conducting bipolar electrode serving as an electronic bridge is provided. Fermi level equilibration between redox species at opposite poles of a bipolar electrode under external bias is discussed. The concept of the Line of Zero Overpotential (LZO) on the bipolar electrode at steady-state conditions under an external bias is introduced. The influence of a series of experimental variables (redox potential of each redox couple, rate constant of electron transfer at each pole, an excess bulk concentration of one redox couple over the other, and areas of the poles of the bipolar electrode in contact with each electrolyte solution) on the final position of the LZO on the bipolar electrode is highlighted. A cyclic voltammogram obtained using a closed bipolar electrochemical cell in a 4-electrode configuration with immiscible aqueous-organic electrolyte solutions is explained using the thermodynamic theory detailed throughout the perspective. The theory presented herein is equally applicable to a closed bipolar electrochemical cell in a 4-electrode configuration with aqueous electrolyte solutions, each containing redox active species, in both compartments connected by a bipolar electrode.									14	0	0	0	2	0	15			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000473071200001	31049537

The direct borohydride fuel cell (DBFC) as an energy conversation device has attracted intensive attention owing to the low theoretical potential of borohydride oxidation reaction (BOR, -1.24 V vs SHE) on the anode. In this paper, the hierarchical sea urchin-like NiMoN@NC coated by thin carbon layer with optimal BH adsorption characteristic was synthesized as a superior electrocatalyst toward BOR. In 1 M NaOH-0.05 M NaBH4, the BOR working potentials are only -55 and 44 mV at the current densities of 10 and 200 mA cm(-2) on NiMoN@NC, respectively. Furthermore, the membrane-free DBFC using NiMoN(i'NC as anodic electrocatalyst shows a maximum power density of 67 mW cm(-2) at room temperature with appreciative stability. This well-designed carbon coated and nitrogen doped transition- metal material with hierarchical nano/microstructure as a highly efficient electrocatalyst shows promising potential and bright prospects in electrocatalysis research and practical application for energy conversion systems of DBFC.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000797959300064	35389615

To improve the photoanodic performance, we investigated the effect of charge transport at the interface between the oxide particles and the conductive substrate using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) under UV-visible light irradiation. As a model oxide, we prepared tungsten oxide (WO3) particle films on different conductive substrates of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass, indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass, and Ti plates at different calcination temperatures. The PEC properties of the WO3 electrodes were evaluated for water oxidation in 0.1 mol/L sulfuric acid. The photocurrent density of the WO3 films on Ti plate (Ti/ WO3) monotonically increased as the calcination temperature increased up to 650?, whereas the WO3 films on FTO-coated and ITO-coated glasses were, as is well known, deactivated at such high temperatures. The EIS measurements of the Ti/WO3 photoanodes revealed that the series resistance (R-s) was low even after calcination at high temperatures. The charge-transfer resistance (R-ct) of WO(3 )photoanodes estimated from EIS was dependent on the incident light intensity because the photocurrent density was proportional to the irradiance. We found that the Ti/WO(3 )photoanodes exhibited a resistance in addition to R(s )and R-ct. We assigned this resitance, which was not changed by the light intensity, to the interfacial charge transport resistance (R-i) between WO(3 )particles and the Ti substrate. A smaller R-i increased the photocurrent density of Ti/WO3 for the oxygen evolution reaction at higher applied potentials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000848235000004

Such information can be strongly affected by matrix-related effects causing spectral and non-spectral interferences and several alternatives have been proposed to overcome these drawbacks. Sample preparation methods with high digestion efficiency have been the most convenient for subsequent ICP analysis. Conventionally, high digestion efficiency can be obtained following protocols based on the addition of a relatively high amount of concentrated reagents combined with operational conditions using high temperature and pressure. Modern instrumentation and a better understanding of chemical reactions related to sample digestion have enabled the achievement of high digestion efficiency even using dilute reagents. In this sense, this review presents the main advances for the digestion of organic samples, based on the reduction of reagents without impairing digestion efficiency for further multielement determination by ICP-based techniques. Recent approaches are highlighted, such as the use of dilute acid solutions with the aid of O-2, H2O2 and UV-assisted digestion, high pressure flow digestion, and combustion methods, all assisted by microwave radiation. The main features and applications reported in the past ten years are also covered. Finally, a critical view of the suitability of metrics for the evaluation of greener digestion methods, mainly for matrices considered hard to be digested using conventional protocols, is presented.									66	2	0	0	37	3	69			0267-9477	1364-5544		WOS:000407078600002

ROLE OF FEOH+ PHOTOOXIDATION								PALEOCEANOGRAPHY				2	4			395	408		10.1029/PA002i004p00395				AUG 1987	1987	A chemical and dynamical model of the Archean ocean is proposed to investigate the consequences of FeOH+ photooxidation in the surface mixed layer. The calculation assumes the presence of small amounts of photosynthetic oxygen, from negligible values to surface concentrations of 10(-6) mol kg(-1). Photooxidation releases hydrogen atoms which can recombine into H-2 molecules, reduce some ferric compounds or react with O-2 to form HO2. The results are presented for various atmospheric CO2 pressures (corresponding to different pH profiles) and for Fe II concentrations in the deep ocean varying from 10(-7) to 10(-4) mol kg(-1). In spite of the uncertainties concerning the description of the Archean world the model indicates that Fe III reduction by hydrogen atoms would have been a minor process, except for unlikely small deepwater Fe II concentrations. Another significant result is that the FeOH+ photooxidation rate was probably limited by upward transport (upwelling and diffusion) of ferrous iron. Thus in the model this rate only depends on the deepwater Fe II content and on the dynamical parameters associated to upwelling and diffusion. It is also shown that two mixed layer O-2 concentrations ([O-2](o)) are critical First for [O-2](o) <= 10(-1) mol kg(-1) the hydrogen atoms produced by photooxidation recombine to form H. By contrast, for [O-2](o) <= 10(-13) mol kg(-1), these atoms are consumed by reaction with O-2, and the HO2 molecule which is releas2ed generates three additional oxidations of Fe II ions. The second critical concentration is [O-2](o) similar or equal to 10(-8) mol kg(-1), for which the photos2ynthetico xygen invades the deep layers of the ocean. In such a case, the photooxidation rate is rapidly decreased, and the direct react ion with O-2 becomes the main oxidation process for Fe II.									8	0	0	0	3	0	8			0883-8305	1944-9186		WOS:000208336800003

Size-Dependent Energy of Ni Nanoparticles on Graphene Films on Ni(111) and Adhesion Energetics by Adsorption Calorimetry								ACS CATALYSIS				12	20			12632	12642		10.1021/acscatal.2c02765		OCT 2022		OCT 21 2022	2022	The use of carbon supports for late transition-metal nanoparticle catalysts has grown substantially in recent years due to efforts to develop electrocatalysts for clean energy applications and catalysts for new aqueous-phase biomass-related conversions and due to the evolution of new carbon materials with unique properties (e.g., graphene, carbon nanotubes, and so forth). However, much less is known about the bonding energetics of catalytic metal nanoparticles on carbon supports in comparison with oxide supports, which are more common for thermal catalysis. Here, we report the growth morphology and heats of adsorption of Ni vapor deposited onto graphene/Ni(111) at 300 K and 100 K using metal vapor single-crystal adsorption calorimetry and He+ low-energy ion scattering (LEIS). These results provide the Ni chemical potential versus particle size, and the Ni/graphene adhesion energy. LEIS intensities suggest that Ni grows as flat-topped face-centered cubic islands with a nearly constant thickness of similar to 1.5 nm when deposited at 300 K. At 100 K, Ni grows as smaller nanoparticles, well modeled as hemispherical hexagonal close-packed nanoparticles with a density of similar to 2 x 10(16) particles/m(2). The Ni chemical potential as a function of average particle diameter in the 0.5 to 4 nm range at 100 K was determined from the heats of Ni gas adsorption. By fitting the measured chemical potential as a function of diameter, we determined an adhesion energy of 3.6 J/m(2) for large Ni particles on graphene/Ni(111). This adhesion energy is in good agreement with previous scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory investigations of Ni/ graphene/Ni(111).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000868337500001

The structures of PCOF-1 and PCOF-2 were studied by FT-IR and C-13 CP-MAS solid state NMR spectroscopy. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns revealed obvious crystallinity with two intense peaks at 3.28 degrees and 3.75 degrees for PCOF-1, and 2.63 degrees and 2.98 degrees for PCOF-2. Structural simulation confirmed their 3D rutile type (pts) topological structures with two different pore sizes. X-ray single crystal diffraction revealed a distorted tetrahedral structure for the building block TFBM with two dihedral angles of 119 degrees and 107.8 degrees, and a planar square structure for the model compound (MC) with an outspread angle of 176.5 degrees. PCOF-1 and PCOF-2 exhibited Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of 316 and 234 m(2) g(-1), respectively. The morphologies of PCOF-1 and PCOF-2 were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy methods. PCOF-1 and PCOF-2 showed a high thermal stability up to 420 degrees C without decomposition through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and high chemical stability with no obvious mass loss after three days of immersion in various solutions. Due to the large surface area and the appropriate pore size, PCOF-Fe exhibited excellent biocatalytic catalytic performance, while PCOF-Co exhibited good electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reactions. These results indicate that 3D porphyrin-based COFs constructed from the tetrahedral building block with steric hindrance are promising candidates for single-site catalysis.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000494834700016

Overpressure sensors, an infrared thermal imager, and a high-velocity photography system were used to compare the explosive fireball temperature, scattering movement, and post-combustion characteristics of composite charges with different non-detonative materials. The fireball temperature distributions of the active non-detonative materials (rubber containing various proportions of aluminum powder) were not uniform, and the heat radiation power, heat flux, and overpressure were relatively high and first decreased and then increased with increasing aluminum powder content. The active non-detonative materials had two high-temperature regions in the lateral direction. Oxygen-free explosions, anaerobic combustion, and post-combustion processes occurred during the energy-release reaction of the composite charges. The temporal evolution of the throwing radius of the explosion products of the composite charges was investigated, and the rate of scattering of the non-detonative materials was analyzed. The rate of scattering was higher than that of an inert non-detonative material (polyurethane) and first increased and then decreased with increasing aluminum powder content. Based on the explosion-proof performance and heat radiation energy output characteristics, rubber containing 50 % aluminum was selected as the optimal non-detonative material.									6	5	0	0	0	0	8			0721-3115	1521-4087		WOS:000452614000009

Structural Progression in Clusters of Ionized Water, (H2O)(n=1-5)(+)								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A				119	4			752	766		10.1021/jp509698y				JAN 29 2015	2015	Ionized water clusters serve as a model of water-splitting chemistry for energetic purposes, as well as postradiolytic events in condensed-phase systems. Structures, properties, and relative energies are presented for oxidized water clusters, (H2O)(n=1-5)(+), using equation-of-motion coupled-cluster theory approaches. In small clusters, an ion-radical contact pair OH center dot center dot center dot H3O+ is known to form upon ionization. The transition from n = 4 to n = 5 molecules in the cluster, however, is found to demarcate a size regime in which a propensity for the ion and radical to separate exists. This trend is consistent with recent experimental vibrational analyses. Decomposition of the cluster energetics reveals that preferential solvation of the hydronium cation by water serves as the dominant driving force for this pair separation, which should persist in larger clusters and bulk water ionization.									36	2	0	0	1	0	36			1089-5639			WOS:000348752400022	25565301	
J	Lugovic, Bosko; Slovenec, Damir; Halamic, Josip; Altherr, Rainer								Petrology, geochemistry and tectonic significance of Mesozoic ultramafic rocks from the Zagorje-Mid-Transdanubian Zone in Croatia								GEOLOGICA CARPATHICA				58	6			511	530						DEC 2007	2007	Ultramafic cumulates of Medvednica Mts form mega-blocks in the ophiolite melange from the Zagorje-Mid-Transdanubian segment of the Sava Zone. The blocks, consist of chromite-olivine cumulates and pyroxenites. The rocks crystallized in an open system under low pressure. Early crystallization of Al-Ti-chromite and Ti-edenite/pargasite indicate high oxygen fugacity hydrous parental magma. The Medvednica Mts ultrarnafic cumulates are analogous to plutonic rocks from recent immature island arcs. Subsolidus reactions indicate rapid exhumation with the final equilibration resembling prehnite-pumpellyite facies. The Medvednica Mts ultramafic cumulate sequence shows common features with the analogous sequence of the Bukk Mts ophiolites from NE Hungary and differ from analogues from the Vardar/Dinaric ophiolite belts. Mantle peridotites lacking overlying crustal members crop out in the Medvednica Mts and Kalnik Mts, and were cored in drill-holes. The peridotites range in composition from lherzolite via transitional harzburgite to depleted harzburgite. Lherzolite resembles abyssal peridotite and together with transitional harzburgites are akin to the peridotites from the South Sandwichs and Mariana arc-back-arc system. Depleted harzburgites are typical of fore-arc peridotites and are similar to the harzburgites of the Inner Dinaride Ophiolite Belt. Assuming that ultrarnafic rocks from the Zagorje-Mid-Transdanubian Zone were generated in a single oceanic domain, the South Sandwich arc-basin system appears as the most similar analogue. If it holds true, then these ultrarnafic rocks must have been derived from the Meliata-Maliac ocean domain and not from the Dinaric/Vardar strands as was previously thought.									14	0	0	0	3	0	14			1335-0552	1336-8052		WOS:000252662100002

However, the rediscovery of g-C3N4 has also spurred enormous interest in other, very versatile applications beyond catalysis. Herein, graphitic carbon nitride nano-sheets could be used as photocatalytic initiators and cross-linking sites for the temperature responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) hydrogel without any sacrificial agents or co-initiators. A prototype of a temperature controlled smart window based on the hydrogel composite was made by coating the hydrogel composite onto glass. It is believed that the combination of g-C3N4 chemistry and conventional hydrogel or polymer chemistry can lead to further promising applications.									64	1	0	0	7	0	64			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000401316100013

The CN-TiO2 prepared using hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) as the dopant source exhibited excellent photoactivity on bisphenol A (BPA) degradation under visible light irradiation. The influences of pH and inorganic anions on BPA degradation were evaluated. Three main studies were elucidated in this work. (1) Effect of HMT dosage on the physicochemical properties and photoactivity of CN-TiO2 was investigated. After 2 h of irradiation with white LED, 95% of BPA was removed by Ti-0.375HMT, which exhibited large surface area (157.7 m(2) g(-1)) and low band gap (2.46 eV). (2) Mineralization and evolution of solution toxicity upon BPA degradation under white LED, simulated solar light and UV irradiation were systematically studied. After 4 h of reaction, BPA was almost completely mineralized under simulated solar light and UV irradiation by the CN-TiO2, and generally the BPA solution became almost non-toxic irrespective of the light source used. (3) Photocatalytic mechanism of BPA degradation by the CN-TiO2 under visible light irradiation was proposed. The carbon and nitrogen codoping could create the intragap localized states located above the valence band of TiO2, and carbonate species formed on the TiO2 surface could serve as photosensitizer. As a result, O-2(center dot-), O-1(2) and h(+) could be generated on the surface of CN-TiO2 under visible light irradiation: they together contributed to the BPA degradation. Particularly, O-2(center dot-) was the predominant oxidative species to oxidize BPA. Trace OH center dot was produced but its role in BPA degradation was insignificant. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Vatistas, N.; Francioni, V.								Anolyte cells of electrocoating paint. I: Anodes, impurities and dissolution								PROGRESS IN ORGANIC COATINGS				65	1			109	115		10.1016/j.porgcoat.2008.10.004				APR 2009	2009	The occasionally occurring sudden destruction of the used stainless steel anodes during the electrocoating process and the regular consumption of their thickness are due respectively to local and non-local anodic dissolutions. The aim of this paper is to identify the operating conditions that protect the anode from the sudden destruction of local dissolution, and also to assess the non-local dissolution rate in order to predict the mean life of these anodes. Both types of dissolution are known in the field of corrosion, but this field concerns passivation and trans-passivation potential and not higher range, i.e. oxygen evolution reaction potential. Specific tests are performed with stainless steels that contain different concentrations of molybdenum and typical weak acids of anolyte solution that normally also contain traces of chloride, sulphate phosphate and nitrate as impurities. The results of these tests show that the anodes operate in non-safeguard conditions with respect local dissolution when: (i) traces of nitrates are absent from the anolyte solution and (ii) low molybdenum concentration stainless steels are used as anodes. When the safeguard conditions are ensured, the rate of non-local dissolution is easily detected and the results obtained show that its value increases with (i) the increase in molybdenum in the stainless steel, (ii) the decrease the pH value of the anolyte solution (iii) the increase in the temperature and (iv) the decrease in anolyte recycling in the cell. The results obtained show that sudden destruction and the mean life of anodes are the result of added chemicals in the paint bath and from the pre-treatments adopted. In other words, the interactions between pre-treatments, electrocciating and accessories (anodes), is required when the optimization of the electrocciating process is proposed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	JIANG, XD; PARMETER, JE; ESTRADA, CA; GOODMAN, DW								THE ADSORPTION AND DECOMPOSITION OF METHANOL ON COPPER OVERLAYERS ON THE RH(100) SURFACE								SURFACE SCIENCE				249	1-3			44	60		10.1016/0039-6028(91)90832-D				JUN 1991	1991	The adsorption and decomposition of methanol on copper overlayers on the Rh(100) surface have been studied using thermal desorption mass spectrometry (TDMS) and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). The reaction scheme of methanol on this model bimetallic catalyst is similar to that on the clean Rh(100) surface, but with a number of important differences. First, the presence of a monolayer or more of copper on the Rh(100) surface greatly inhibits methanol decomposition and also reduces the binding energy of molecularly adsorbed methanol. That portion of the methanol monolayer that desorbs reversibly desorbs near 200 K on a Rh(100) surface with a pseudomorphic copper monolayer and at approximately 180 K when two or more monolayers of copper are present, compared with approximately 210 K on clean Rh(100). Second, formation of methoxy via OH bond cleavage of the adsorbed methanol occurs on the copper overlayer as on the clean surface, but to a reduced extent. Compared with methoxy formed on clean Rh(100), which decomposes completely by 320 K, methoxy formed on the copper overlayers is substantially more stable. On a pseudomorphic copper monolayer, the methoxy is stable up to approximately 370 K; when two or more monolayers of copper are present, the methoxy decomposition is complete only near 400 K. Unlike the case of methoxy on clean Rh(100), decomposition of methoxy on the copper overlayers is accompanied by formaldehyde evolution. Third, the methoxy on the copper overlayers exhibits a metal-oxygen stretching frequency that is substantially reduced compared with the frequency of this mode on clean Rh(100). These observations are discussed in relation to the chemistry of methanol on various copper surfaces, and in terms of the electronic and structural effects which may lead to such changes.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			0039-6028			WOS:A1991FV26700018

However, its large-scale application is limited by the poor rate performance and low stability. In this work, we suggest that the electronic structure tuning can effectively improve the capacity but also enhance the stability. Such tuning can be readily realized by coupling NiMoO4 with SnO2. The introduction of SnO2 promotes the electron transfer from NiMoO4 to SnO2 and therefore reduces the electron density of NiMoO4, which leads to an enhanced adsorption of OH- ions and thus boosts the capacity. As a result, the SnO2@NiMoO4/CP core-shell electrode exhibits a high capacity of 0.65 mA h cm(-2) (257.8 mAh g(-1)) at a current density of 5 mA cm(-2) (2 mA g(-1)) along with greatly enhanced stability. Besides, the assembled HSC device using SnO2@NiMoO4/CP as cathode and active carbon/CP as anode shows a superior specific capacity of 109.5 mAh g(-1) at 5 mA cm(-2) and excellent cycling performance with a capacity retention of 92.2% at 50 mA cm(-2), as well as a high specific energy of 78.4 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 895 W kg(-1), outperforming many other reported hybrid supercapacitors.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000617802800001

Monolayer MoS2 and WS2 are promising materials for the energetically demanding water oxidation reaction, absorbing similar to 10% of incident light in the visible spectrum and possessing chemical stability and band edges more positive than the oxidation potential of water. A heterostructure of MoS2/WS2 forms a type-II heterojunction, supporting fast separation of the photogenerated charge carriers across the junction. Here, we show the role played by defects in determining the efficiency of the photon-driven oxidation process. By reducing the defects in this material system, it is possible to obtain an incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of similar to 1.6% and a visible-light-driven photocurrent density of 1.7 mA/cm(2) for water oxidation. The efficiency is one order of magnitude higher than that of photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen reduction and water oxidation supported by liquid-phase exfoliated transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). This result has been achieved with chemically vapor deposited (CVD) MoS2/WS2 heterojunctions, in the form of 100 mu m large flakes assembled to form thin films. The large flakes sizes, compared to liquid-phase exfoliated materials (normally <5 mu m), and thus the low edge flake density, and the flakes' atomically sharp and clean interfaces between the flakes are responsible for reducing charge carrier recombination. These results show a general approach to the scalable synthesis of high-crystal-quality low dimensional semiconductor photoelectrodes for solar energy conversion systems. It also shows the uniqueness of the CVD synthesis process of these materials, which can lead to high quality materials without the need of any postsynthesis treatments.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2574-0962			WOS:000483434700063

Herein, we report on a cobalt MOF phase with 3D well-aligned nanosheets array if architecture on carbon cloth (Co-MOF NS/CC), fabricated by a facile ambient liquid-phase deposition, could serve as a self-standing Janus catalytic electrode toward both glucose and water oxidation. It shows good glucose-sensing performance with low determination limit and large detection range. Also, it exhibits high water-oxidation efficiency with low overpotential and good durability. This work demonstrates the potential of utilizing transition-metal based well-aligned MOF nanoarrays for electrocatalytic oxidation.									68	0	0	0	6	0	68			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000439250500048	29956927

This question is addressed for cobalt phosphate catalysts deposited on inert electrodes, namely crystallites of pakhomovskyite (Co-3(PO4)(2)8H(2)O, Pak) and phosphate-containing Co oxide (CoCat). X-ray spectroscopy reveals that oxidizing potentials transform the crystalline Pak slowly (5-8h) but completely into the amorphous CoCat. Electrochemical analysis supports high-TOF surface activity in Pak, whereas its amorphization results in dominating volume activity of the thereby formed CoCat material. In the directly electrodeposited CoCat, volume catalysis prevails, but not at very low levels of the amorphous material, implying high-TOF catalysis at surface sites. A complete picture of heterogeneous water oxidation requires insight in catalysis at the electrolyte-exposed outer surface, within a hydrated, amorphous volume phase, and modes and kinetics of restructuring upon operation.									127	8	0	0	8	0	128			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000350100000030	25645186

Respiratory investigation				60	6			762	771		10.1016/j.resinv.2022.06.015				2022-Nov	2022	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of lung ultrasound (LUS) in determining the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia compared with thoracic computed tomography (CT) and establish the correlations between LUS score, inflammatory markers, and percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2).METHODS: This prospective observational study, conducted at Targu-Mureș Pulmonology Clinic included 78 patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection via nasopharyngeal real-time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (30 were excluded). Enrolled patients underwent CT, LUS, and blood tests on admission. Lung involvement was evaluated in 16 thoracic areas, using AB1 B2 C (letters represent LUS pattern) scores ranging 0-48.RESULTS: LUS revealed bilateral B-lines (97.8%), pleural irregularities with thickening/discontinuity (75%), and subpleural consolidations (70.8%). Uncommon sonographic patterns were alveolar consolidations with bronchogram (33%) and pleural effusion (2%). LUS score cutoff values of ≤14 and>22 predicted mild COVID-19 (sensitivity [Se]=84.6%; area under the curve [AUC]=0.72; P=0.002) and severe COVID-19 (Se=50%, specificity (Sp)=91.2%, AUC=0.69; P=0.02), respectively, and values>29 predicted the patients' transfer to the intensive care unit (Se=80%, Sp=97.7%). LUS score positively correlated with CT score (r=0.41; P=0.003) and increased with the decrease of SpO2 (r=-0.49; P=0.003), with lymphocytes decline (r=-0.52; P=0.0001). Patients with consolidation patterns had higher ferritin and C-reactive protein than those with B-line patterns (P=0.01; P=0.03).CONCLUSIONS: LUS is a useful, non-invasive and effective tool for diagnosis, monitoring evolution, and prognostic stratification of COVID-19 patients.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2212-5353		MEDLINE:35995704	35995704

Searching and constructing high-efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts is vital in the practical applications of electrocatalytic water splitting. Although transition metal-based materials have been considered as promising electrocatalysts, the satisfactory activities are usually not built on the bulk materials, but strongly relying on elaborately designing these electrocatalysts. Herein, the recent theoretical and experimental progress on modification strategies to improve the intrinsic activities is summarized, especially including element doping, phase engineering, structure cooperation, interface engineering, vacancy engineering, strain engineering and self-functionalization. Finally, the future oppor-tunities and challenges on these modification strategies are also proposed. Overall, it is anticipated that these modification strategies offer some new understandings on rationally constructing non-noble elec-trocatalysts for efficient electrocatalytic water splitting.(c) 2020 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

A grand challenge of NRR is the development of efficient electrocatalysts, for which the delicate nanostructuring of catalysts plays an important role. Herein, a series of Fe-doped Cu2-xS quantum dots (QDs) are synthesized with multiple active sites and interface engineering, in which the double-phase heterostructure plays a key role for boosting NRR activity. The yield of NH3 was obviously improved with the increase of Fe content from 0 to 3% but started to decrease with Fe from 3 to 9%. The optimized Fe-3%-Cu2-xS QDs show an outstanding NH3 yield of 26.4 mu g h(-1) mg(-1) cat at -0.7 V (vs the reversible hydrogen electrode), which is 5 times higher than that of Cu2-xS QDs. More importantly, we observed that the highest NRR activity in Fe-3%-Cu2-xS QDs was ascribed to the formation of an inherent double-phase heterostructure of Cu2-xS/Cu5FeS4, whereas the complete conversion to single-phase Cu5FeS4 with increased Fe doping (9%) resulted in the activity decrease. Further, N-2 temperature-programmed desorption and electrochemical impedance spectra characterizations confirm the stronger chemical adsorption of N-2 and faster charge transfer in the Cu2-xS/Cu5FeS4 QDs. A plausible mechanism was proposed for the double-phase Cu2-xS/Cu5FeS4 heterostructure, where the interface provides efficient charge transfer and more active sites of Cu, Fe, and S for the synergetic adsorption and activation of N-2. Our work provides a simple strategy for the design of NRR electrocatalysts, which may also bring new inspiration for the preparation of the inherent double-phase heterostructure within other doped QDs.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2168-0485			WOS:000621667100021

A detailed investigation using in situ techniques was carried out to understand the fundamental aspects of chemical reactions during photoelectrochemical characterization. The alpha-Fe2O3/Co-NC-Fe photoanodes showed a higher photoelectrochemical performance compared to the individual materials. Despite the higher achieved performance of alpha-Fe2O3/Co-NC-Fe, the elucidation of the main contribution upon Co-NC-Fe incorporation was found to be dependent on the different charge transfer mechanism under light illumination. Therefore, given the complexity of the redox processes that take place in Co-NC-Fe under an applied bias, we have systematically investigated the dark- and light-induced effects on alpha-Fe2O3/Co-NC-Fe by in situ UV-vis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies. These techniques allowed us to monitor the effect of the electro and photoelectrochemical potential in several redox processes. The insightful results indicate that, in addition to surface state modification effects, the improvement of the photocurrent density may also result from long-lived holes at the electrode surface as a consequence of the electron transfer from the conduction band alpha-Fe2O3 to Co-NC-Fe with a Fe-III oxidation state. This indicates a second electron pathway during charge separation, thereby contributing to the increase in the electron-hole pair lifetime and the accumulation of photogenerated holes at the alpha-Fe2O3/Co-NC-Fe photoanode surface to drive water oxidation.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2574-0962			WOS:000586710300070

The as-prepared MOF nanodisk exhibited good electrocatalytic activity and selectivity towards nitrite due to the independent distribution of the porphyrin molecules in the framework and the sandwich structure of the prepared Zn-TCPP(BP) nanodisk, which increased the accessible active sites.									72	6	0	0	8	0	72			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000424466300044

Data from twelve California Air Resources Board monitoring sites in Sacramento, CA, and the downwind Mountain Counties air basin are analyzed to reveal day of week patterns in ozone and its precursors in the summers of 1998-2002. Measurements of non-methane hydrocarbons are available for the summers of 2001-2003 at three of these sites and NOx at six of these sites for the full time period. This routine monitoring data is complemented by data sets of ozone and nitrogen oxide concentrations obtained in the summers of 2001 and 2003 at three sites in the region and comprehensive measurements of VOC reactivity at two sites in 2001. Daytime concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NOx equivalent to NO+NO2) are approximately 35% lower on weekends at all the sites, whereas the VOC reactivity changes by less than 10%. All six sites in the Sacramento Valley have higher 8-h maximum average ozone on the weekend and are more likely to exceed the national standard of 85 ppb on the weekend. In contrast, all the sites in the Mountain Counties are less likely to exceed the federal ozone standard on the weekend. Analysis of the day-of-week trends in odd oxygen show that the weekend effect of ozone within Sacramento is strongly influenced by NO sources close to the monitoring sites. This suggests that ozone measurements from monitoring sites close to highways, including two rural locations, may not be representative of the regional abundance, and lead to underestimates of long term exposure for humans and ecosys									120	2	1	0	50	0	120			1680-7316	1680-7324		WOS:000251239200004

Using a mass spectrometer and gas permeable membrane to detect the O-32(2) product, the yield and lifetime of the active state of the flash-induced catalase (to be referred to simply as 'flash-catalase') reaction were measured after forming the S-2 or S-0-states by a short flash. The increase in flash-catalase activity with H2O2 concentration exhibits a K-m = 10-20 mM, and originates from an increase in the lifetime by 20-fold of the active state. The increased lifetime in the presence of peroxide is ascribed to formation of the long-lived S-0-state at the expense of the unstable S-2-state. The anion inhibition site differs from the chloride site involved in stimulating the photolytic water oxidation reaction (2H(2)O --> O-2 + 4e(-) + 4H(+)). Whereas water oxidation requires Cl- and is inhibited with increasing effectiveness by F- << CN- << N-3(-), the flash-catalase reaction is weakly inhibited by Cl-, and with increasing effectiveness by F- << CN-, N-3(-). Unlike water oxidation, chloride is unable to suppress or reverse inhibition of the flash-catalase reaction caused by these anions. The inhibitor effectiveness correlates with the pK(a) of the conjugate acid, suggesting that the protonated species may be the active inhibitor. The reduced activity arises from a shortening of the lifetime of the flash-induced catalase active state by 3-10 fold owing to stronger anion binding in the flash-induced states, S-2 and S-0, than in the dark S-states, S-1 and S--1. To account for the paradoxical result that higher anion concentrations are required to inhibit at lower H2O2 concentrations, where S-2 forms initially after the flash, than at higher H2O2 concentrations, where S-0 forms initially after the flash, stronger anion binding to the S-0-state than to the S-2-state is proposed. A kinetic model is given which accounts for these equilibria with anions and H2O2. The rate constant for the formation/release of O-2 by reduction of S-2 in the WOC is < 0.4 s(-1).									15	0	0	0	14	0	15			0166-8595			WOS:A1993MX41700026	24318000

Herein, various self-supporting amorphous Ni-based neutral water oxidation electrodes were fabricated by anion regulation. Among them, the Ni(OH)(2)/Ni:Pi electrode only needs an over-potential of 340 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) at pH 7.2. Stability tests show that its activity is maintained for at least 5000 s at a high current density (10 mA cm(-2)). This study demonstrates that high valence state Ni atoms and the Ni:Pi component are responsible for its high activity and stability, respectively.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2052-1553			WOS:000512754200009

While annealing at 600 degrees C produces films consisting of a mixture of monoclinic WO3 and hematite alpha-Fe2O3, the heating at a temperature above 1000 degrees C affords formation of ferric tungstate Fe2WO6. Both kinds of films exhibit optical absorption range comparable or exceeding that of alpha-Fe2O3. Another important feature is a decreased rate of charge recombination of the mixed-oxide Fe2O3-WO3 with respect to the ferric oxide photo-anodes.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1793-6047	1793-7213		WOS:000346570800004

Herein, we report an innovative two-step method to prepare a core shell nanostructured S-doped rutile TiO2 (R'-TiO2-S). This modified black rutile TiO2 sample exhibits remarkably enhanced absorption in visible and near-infrared regions and efficient charge separation and transport. As a result, the unique sulfide surface (TiO2-x:S) boosts the photocatalytic water cleaning and water splitting with a steady solar hydrogen production rate of 0.258 mmol h(-1) g(-1). The black titania is also an excellent photoelectrochemical electrode exhibiting a high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 1.67%. The sulfided surface shell is proved to be an effective strategy for enhancing solar light absorption and photoelectric conversion.									373	14	0	0	23	0	375			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000328099400034	24164550

This is crucial because the water oxidation half reaction is overwhelmingly rate-limiting and needs high over-voltage (approx. 1 V), which results in low conversion efficiencies when working at current densities required for hydrogen production via water splitting. Particular attention has been given to the manganese compounds not only because manganese has been used by nature to oxidize water but also because manganese is cheap and environmentally friendly. The manganese-calcium cluster in PSII has a dimension of about approximately 0.5 nm. Thus, nano-sized manganese compounds might be good structural and functional models for the cluster. As in the nanometre-size of the synthetic models, most of the active sites are at the surface, these compounds could be more efficient catalysts than micrometre (or bigger) particles. In this paper, we focus on nano-sized manganese oxides as functional and structural models of the WOC of PSII for hydrogen production via water splitting and review nano-sized manganese oxides used in water oxidation by some research groups.									110	1	0	0	25	1	110			1742-5689	1742-5662		WOS:000308240400001	22809849	
J	Mallick, Laxmikanta; Chakraborty, Biswarup								Ionic gamma-FeO(OH) Nanocrystal Stabilized by Small Isopolymolybdate Clusters as Reactive Core for Water Oxidation.								Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)											10.1002/chem.202203033				2022-Oct-31	2022	At near neutral to basic pH, hydrolysis induced aggregation to insoluble bulk iron-oxide is often regarded as the pitfalls of molecular iron clusters. Iron-oxide nanocrystals are encouragingly active over the molecular clusters and/or bulk oxides albeit, stabilizing such nanostructures in aqueous pH and under turnover condition remain a perdurable challenge. Herein, an Anderson[Mo7O24]6- isopolyanion, a small (0.85 nm) isolable polyoxometalate (POM) possessing only {31} atoms, has been introduced for the first time as a covalent linker to stabilize an infinitely stable and aqueous-soluble gamma-FeO(OH) nanocore. During the hydrothermal isolation of the material, a partial dissociation of the parent [Mo7O24]6- may lead to the in-situ generation of few analogous [MoxOy]n- clusters, proved by Raman study, which can also participate in stabilizing the gamma-FeO(OH) nanocore, MoxOy@FeO(OH). However, due to high ionic charge on {Mo=O} terminals of the [MoxOy]n-, they are covalently linked via MoVI-2O-FeIII bridging to gamma-FeO(OH) core in MoxOy@FeO(OH), established by numerous spectroscopic and microscopic evidences. Such bonding mode is more likely as precedent from the coordination motif documented in the transition metal clusters stabilized by this POM. The gamma-FeO(OH) nanocore of MoxOy@FeO(OH) behaves as potent active center for electrochemical water oxidation with a overpotential, 263 mV @ 10 mA cm-2, lower than that observed for bare gamma-FeO(OH). Despite of some molybdenum dissolution from the POM ligands to the electrolyte, residual anionic POM fragments covalently bound to the OER active gamma-FeO(OH) core of the MoxOy@FeO(OH) makes the surface predominantly ionic that results in an ordered electrical double layer to promote a better charge transport across the electrode-electrolyte junction, less likely in bulk gamma-FeO(OH).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1521-3765		MEDLINE:36310518	36310518

Herein, we explore a ligand-engineering strategy involving the use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and combining the desirable features of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts for boosting the activity of CO2RR. Zn-based MOFs involving two different azolate functional ligands, i.e., 1,2,4-triazole (Calgary Framework 20, CALF20) and 2-methylimidazole (zeolitic imidazolate framework-8, ZIF-8), were investigated for CO2RR in an alkaline flow cell electrolyzer. The highest CO partial current density of -53.2 mA/cm(2) was observed for a Zn-based MOF (CALF20). CALF20 showed the highest reported Faradaic efficiency of Zn-based MOFs for CO production (similar to 94% at -0.97 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE), with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 1360.8 h(-1) and a partial current density of -32.8 mA/cm(2). Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) results indicate that the sp(2) carbon atoms in azole ligands coordinated with the metal center in MOFs are the active sites for CO2RR due to the fully occupied 3d orbital of Zn(II) centers. Ab initio investigation shows that both azolate frameworks in CALF20 and ZIF-8 have the most favorable adsorption sites at the N-sp(2) C. Adopting the triazole ligand in CALF20 enhances the charge transfer (as compared with the diazole group in ZIF-8), which induces more electrons in the adjacent active sites at the azole ligand and facilitates *COOH formation, boosting current density and Faradaic efficiency toward CO production. This study suggests that ligand engineering in MOFs could be a viable approach to design a highly efficient CO2RR catalyst.									16	2	0	0	2	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000664333800057		
J	Hu, Leiming; Hong, Bo Ki; Oh, Jong-Gil; Litster, Shawn				Hu, Leiming/AAS-7934-2021				Reversal Tolerant Anodes Using Protective Layers for Highly Robust Automotive Fuel Cells								ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS				4	1			119	127		10.1021/acsaem.0c02011		JAN 2021		JAN 25 2021	2021	Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) powered by polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) need an improvement in their durability and robustness to achieve broader commercialization. Cell reversal induced by hydrogen starvation could significantly reduce the performance and durability of the PEMFC system in a short time. Here, we present the cell performance degradation and cell failure mechanisms during hydrogen starvation through examining membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) with several different anode structures. For an MEA with conventional anode composed of carbon-supported platinum catalyst (Pt/C), the degradation caused by cell reversal primarily comes from carbon support corrosion. It is worth noting that an MEA with Pt black-only anode without any carbon also fails during hydrogen starvation. It is postulated that cell failure and performance degradation of the MEA with Pt black-only anode are caused by the corrosion of carbon materials present in the anode microporous layer (MPL) in gas diffusion layers. Based on these findings, we proposed a reversal tolerant anode (RTA) composed of both Pt black as a catalyst layer and thin titanium (Ti) as a protective layer. The conventional MEA with Pt/C anode exhibits the highest cell voltage degradation rate of 15.2% loss/min and the lowest reversal tolerance, whereas this new RTA MEA with Pt black and 13.0 mu m thick Ti layer anode gives the lowest cell voltage degradation rate of 0.049% loss/min and the highest reversal tolerance, which is an approximately 310-fold increase compared with the conventional MEA with Pt/C anode. These findings will greatly contribute to designing a new concept of RTAs and enhancing the cell voltage reversal tolerance of PEMFCs dramatically under severe operating conditions of hydrogen starvation and thus improving the competitiveness of FCEVs.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2574-0962			WOS:000613720100016

HP6 with excellent molecular recognition capability will securely capture the electron transfer medium thionin (Thi). Compared with other electroactive molecular capture methods (physical adsorption, etc.), the formation of an HP6 superset of Thi complex can effectively inhibit the leakage of Thi and significantly increase the loading of Thi. HP6@Au was prepared in an aqueous solution with OH- at room temperature through an oxidation-reduction reaction between HP6 and AuCl4-, without the need for conventional harsh reducing agents. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared studies have shown that the -OH groups in HP6 are oxidized to -COOH groups, and Au3+ in AuCl4- is reduced to Au-0, leading to nucleation and production of AuNPs. The formation of HP6@Au strengthens the electron transfer rate, increases surface area, and captures a large number of primary antibodies (Ab1). Besides, the surface of N-doped carbon quantum dots and cobalt oxide (N-CQDs@Co3O4) can be used for the deposition of HP6@Au by pi-pi interaction to form a green highly conductive nanocomposite. An electrochemical immunosensor with significant stability was constructed based on HP6@Au/N-CQDs@Co3O4, and it was used for the effective detection of human epididymis protein 4 (HE4). The detection limit of the proposed immunosensor platform is 1.5 pg mL(-1), and it provides a wide linear range from 0.002 to 20 ng mL(-1) under optimal conditions. The analysis results of HE4 in human serum are satisfactory and have broad application prospects in clinical monitoring.									8	0	0	0	3	0	8			2168-0485			WOS:000551360900022

The well-conductive CB particles were dispersed homogeneously onto the petals of the Ni-Fe LDH flowers via a combination of electrostatic forces and ripening growth, and remarkably promoted the charge-transfer capability of the LDHs. The hybridized Ni-Fe LDH/ CB composite electrode exhibited excellent rate performance that retained both a high capacity and steady cycle life at a large charge-discharge current, and was highly competitive serving as a high-rate alkaline battery cathode.									25	2	0	0	3	0	25			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000372754000027

The alloyed nature of these materials supports the existence of surface phenomena and structural motifs not present in single-component materials. These novel features result in electrochemical and catalytic behaviors, requiring entirely new categories of explanations. In this perspective concrete examples are used to illustrate several of these chemical and structural features, which are unique to multi-component metal surfaces. The influence of the surface's structure and surroundings (e. g. adsorbates) on each other provides a common thread, with the emergence of dynamic surfaces as its terminus. In considering three model systems (PtRu, PtNi and AuPd), we discuss not only a selection of surface phenomena relevant to each, but also the implications of these alloy-related behaviors for the electrochemical and catalytic properties of each surface.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000339173700003	24950709

To this end, the present work demonstrates a facile synthetic route towards self-standing nanocubiods consisting of nickel-cobalt hexacyano frameworks, commonly known as Prussian blue (NC-PB)-analogue, anchored on carbon nanotubes (NC-PB@CNT) via an ion-exchange strategy. The overall water splitting performance of the NC-PB@CNT films was systematically investigated in an alkaline KOH electrolyte. The optimized NC-PB@CNT film is shown to provide an outstanding overall-water splitting performance with a low cell voltage of 1.66 Vat a rate of 50 mAcm(-2), along with an excellent long-term cell durability of more than 100 h. Furthermore, the addition of urea to the alkaline electrolyte is ascertained to decrease the cell voltage to 1.37 Vwith oxidation of urea at a rate of 50 mAcm(-2). The enhanced overall water splitting and urea oxidation (UOR) performance of the optimized NCPB@CNT electrode are assumed to arise from a synergistic effect between the carbon nanotubes and the framework structures, which enhances the catalytic active sites and provides a facile charge transport pathway between them.									28	0	0	0	0	0	28			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000713702500002

However, the serious restacking and aggregation of the 2D nanosheets are still hampering their applications. To circumvent the issues of 2D nanosheets, one efficient strategy is to construct 3D structures with hierarchical porous structures, good chemical/mechanical stabilities and tunable electrical conductivities. In this review, we firstly focus on the available synthetic approaches of 3D structures from 2D nanosheets, and then summarize the relationships between the microstructures of 3D structures built from 2D nanosheets and their electrochemical behaviors for lithium storage. On the basis of above results, some challenges are briefly discussed in the perspective of the development of various functional 3D structures.

Pt is conformally electrodeposited around the surface of carbon nanotubes grown on a self-standing nanofibrous electrode (NFE). We found that by combining two cost-effective and up-scalable techniques, electrospinning and electrodeposition it is possible to produce a layered electrode with tunable lacunarity and engineer the surface area distribution along the electrode thickness and in turn the Pt content distribution. It is possible to obtain an electrocatalyst with outstanding Pt exploitation and high durability while minimizing fabrication complexity. We produced hierarchical 3D electrocatalyst layers with tunable morphology that can be used directly in a membrane electrode assembly, allowing the complete exploitation of their highly porous structure, in a similar fashion to other 3D macroscopic assembly techniques.

Reaction with the boron nitride crucible used in the high-pressure set-up led also to the formation of the mixed-valent Te-IV,Te-VI borate (Ca13Te2/3Te3.75O15)-Te-VI-O-IV(BO3)(4)(OH)(3) (II) as a minor phase. The crystal structures of both compounds were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction [I: P2(1)/c, Z = 4, a = 11.0272(1), b = 12.0588(1), c = 10.1038(1)angstrom, beta = 91.849(1)degrees, R1(F-2) = 0.0317, wR2(F-2) = 0.0459; II: P6(3)/m, Z = 2, a = 9.0890(13), c = 18.731(4)angstrom, R1(F-2) = 0.0401, wR2(F-2) = 0.0867]. The principal building units of HP-Ca4Te5O14, namely [CaOx] (x = 7, 8) and (TeO3)-O-IV and (TeO4)-O-IV polyhedra, are similar to those of the ambient modification, but the structural set-up is markedly different in the two structures with an increase in density of about 6.6 %. (Ca13Te2/3Te3.75O15)-Te-VI-O-IV(BO3)(4)(OH)(3) is the first compound known so far to contain both oxotellurate and oxoborate units. The most remarkable feature of its disordered crystal structure is the centrosymmetric Te3O6 unit consisting of a (TeO6)-O-VI octahedron sharing opposite faces with two trigonal (TeO3)-O-IV pyramids. The face-sharing of Te-VI and Te-IV oxopolyhedra is unprecedented in the crystal chemistry of oxotellurates. In both structures I and II, the lone-electron pairs of the Te-IV atoms are stereochemically active.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000383607800008

The compound was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic absorption spectroscopy and electrochemistry. The new compound was a conductive, recyclable, highly dispersible, magnetically separable, environmentally friendly, and nano-sized catalyst for water oxidation via cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate or Ru(bpy)(3)(3+) and electrochemical water oxidation. The turnover frequency of Mn oxide/gold/iron for water oxidation via cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate is 0.4 mmol O-2 per mol Mn per second, which shows that this catalyst is among the best Mn-based catalysts for water oxidation. We also showed a strategy for placing this catalyst on the surface of an electrode without adding any other compounds.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000377911000022	27172430

The magnetic effect of hydroxyls on TiO nanoclusters has been studied by measuring the evolution of the magnetic moment as a function of moisture exposure time, which increases the hydroxyl concentration. Our combined experiment and density-functional theory (DFT) calculations show that as dissociative water adsorption transforms oxygen vacancies into hydroxyls, the magnetic moment shows a significant increase. DFT calculations show that the magnetic moment created by hydroxyls arises from 3d orbitals of neighboring Ti sites predominantly from the top and second monolayers. The two nonequivalent hydroxyls contribute differently to the magnetic moment, which decreases as the separation of hydroxyls increases. This work illustrates the essential interplay among defect structure, local structural relaxation, charge redistribution, and magnetism. The microscopic differentiation and clarification of the specific roles of each kind of intrinsic defect is critical for the future applications of dilute magnetic oxides in spintronic or other multifunctional materials.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000311641500015	23132145

The endstation is located at the Swiss Light Source and can be attached to the soft x-ray in situ spectroscopy beamline (X07DB) for solid-gas type experiments and to a tender x-ray beamline (PHOENIX I) for solid-liquid interface experiments. The setup consists of three interconnected ultrahigh vacuum chambers: one for sample preparation using surface science techniques, the analysis chamber for APXPS experiments, and an entry-lock chamber for sample transfer across the two pressure regimes. The APXPS chamber is designed to study solid-liquid interfaces stabilized by the dip and pull method. Using a three-electrode setup, the potential difference across the solid-electrolyte interface can be controlled, as is demonstrated here using an Ir(001) electrode dipped and pulled from a 0.1M KOH electrolyte. The new endstation is successfully commissioned and will offer unique opportunities for fundamental studies of phenomena that take place at solid-liquid interfaces and that are relevant for fields such as electrochemistry, photochemistry, or biochemistry, to name a few.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			0034-6748	1089-7623		WOS:000515577200001	32113422	
J	Fushimi, Rebecca; Gleaves, John								Recent advances in dynamic chemical characterization using Temporal Analysis of Products								CURRENT OPINION IN CHEMICAL ENGINEERING				21		SI		10	21		10.1016/j.coche.2018.02.002				SEP 2018	2018	The Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP) technique is a pulse response methodology that reveals the time-dependent evolution of chemical processes between a gas phase molecule and a solid surface. By simplifying both the transport and kinetic processes the complexity of a multistep chemical processes can be distilled to where the underlying fundamental steps can be distinguished. Moreover, the technique is applicable to real materials (e. g. industrial catalysts) and hence the complexity of the solid is studied intact; a 'top-down' approach. In this short review we discuss key theoretical advancements in the interpretation of pulse response data; though not yet widely implemented, we will highlight the broader impacts of the Y-Procedure method [1(..)], momentary equilibrium phenomena [2(..)] and kinetic coherency discrimination [3(..)] over more commonly used analysis techniques. The conventional TAP approach for mechanism development is well-laid out in a recent work focused on the upgrading of ethanol to higher hydrocarbons. This includes detailed comparison of the time characteristics of reactant, intermediate and product pulses in both single pulse and pump/probe modes [4(..)]. This work calls to mind some of the challenges in the conventionally used residual gas analyzer for pulse response detection of homologous products. A new detection method using photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy (PEPICO) was recently demonstrated for a TAP-like setup [5(..)]. This method presents the exciting opportunity to better resolve complex product spectra and even isomeric species. This enables the mechanistic detail of the TAP technique to be applied to more complex probe molecules as are needed for the study of biomass conversion processes. Finally, we discuss directions for the future development of instrumentation that can directly connect this rich kinetic data to features of catalyst structural and composition.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2211-3398			WOS:000452899100004

Herein, carbon quantum dots (CQDs) implanted in the surface plane of g-C3N4 nanotubes were synthesized by thermal polymerization of freeze-dried urea and CQDs precursor. The CQD-implanted g-C3N4 nanotubes (CCTs) could simultaneously facilitate photoelectron transport and suppress charge recombination through their specially coupled heterogeneous interface. The electronic structure and morphology were optimized in the CCTs, contributing to greater visible light absorption and a weakened barrier of the photocarrier transfer. As a result, the CCTs exhibited efficient photocatalytic performance under light irradiation with a high H-2 production rate of 3538.3 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) and a notable quantum yield of 10.94% at 420 nm.									286	14	0	0	40	1	287			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000431488200032	29569367

An amount of H-2 of similar to 2701h(-1) was produced at 60 A (600 mA cm(-2)) and 70 degrees C under 876 W of applied electrical power. The corresponding specific energy consumed in the process was 3.24 Wh.1(-1)H(2). The Faradic and electrical efficiencies were determined. Overall stack efficiencies of 73% and 85%, at 60 A and 70 degrees C, with respect to the low and high heating value of hydrogen, respectively, were obtained. These results confirmed the successful scale-up of a previous lab-scale device. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Q(A)(-) formation and P680(+.) Pheo(-.) recombination in PS II were analyzed by introducing modifications due to replacement of H2O by D2O or the addition of cryoprotectants. The rate constants of primary charge separation and subsequent stabilization were derived from measurements of time resolved fluorescence decay curves in PS II membrane fragments with reaction centers kept in the open state by addition of K-3[Fe(CN)(6)]. The numerical analysis of the experimental data was performed on the basis of the exciton radical pair equilibrium model proposed by Holzwarth and coworkers (Schatz, G. et al. (1988) Biophys. J. 54, 397-405). Recombination kinetics of the radical pair P680(+.) Pheo(-.) were measured using D1-D2-cyt b559 preparations resuspensed in either H2O or D2O. It was found that: (a) the molecular rate constants k(PC) of the primary charge separation and that of the subsequent stabilization step, k(stab), were about (3 ps)(-1) and (300 ps)(-1), respectively; (b) these rate constants were only slightly affected by D2O or cryoprotectants; (c) small H/D isotope exchange effects were also found in PS II core complexes and Tris-washed PS II membrane fragments; (d) the recombination kinetics of the P680(+.) Pheo(-.) radical pair in D1-D2-cyt b559 preparations is almost invariant to replacement of H2O by D2O, The results obtained reveal that in PS II the charge separation and recombination processes are only weakly dependent on the network of hydrogen bridges with exchangeable protons, in contrast to pronounced effects observed in anoxygenic purple bacteria (Paschenko et al. (1987) FEES Lett, 214, 28-34), The measured differences between both types of reaction centers are discussed.									23	1	0	0	18	0	24			0005-2728			WOS:A1996VC05400004

The effects of TiO2 levels on coke structure and properties were then considered. Mercury intrusion porosimetry analysis showed that, at increasing TiO2 addition, macropore level increased but mesopores level decreased. In part because of these changes in pore properties, coke mechanical strength decreased but its strength after gasification improved up to a TiO2 addition of about 1% and then deteriorated slightly. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that average stacking heights and lateral size of layer structures varied with TiO2 addition levels. Crystallites volume was determined through assuming a cylindrical carbon structure with multiple multi-aromatic rings arranged in parallel. A logarithmic relationship was found to exist between this parameter and coke thermal properties. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis showed a strong linear correlation between the coke reactivity, coke strength after reaction, and C = O content in the oxygen functional groups. It was concluded from this study that added TiO2 decreased the proportion of carbon active sites in the coke because of increasing carbon crystallites volume and decreasing C = O functional groups, and this resulted in decreased reactivity during gasification and increased coke strength after gasification.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1939-2699	1939-2702		WOS:000664330200005

However, the controllable and efficient synthesis of SACs remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report a controlled one-pot synthesis of nickel single atoms embedded on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NiSA-N-CNT) and nitrogen-doped graphene (NiSA-N-G). The formation of NiSA-N-CNT is due to the solid-to-solid rolling up mechanism during the high temperature pyrolysis at 800 degrees C from the stacked and layered Ni-doped g-C3N4, g-C3N4-Ni structure to a tubular CNT structure. Addition of citric acid introduces an amorphous carbon source on the layered g-C3N4-Ni and after annealing at the same temperature of 800 degrees C, instead of formation of NiSA-N-CNT, Ni single atoms embedded in planar graphene type supports, NiSA-N-G were obtained. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicates the introduction of amorphous carbon source substantially reduces the structure fluctuation or curvature of layered g-C3N4-Ni intermediate products, thus interrupting the solid-to-solid rolling process and leading to the formation of planar graphene type supports for Ni single atoms. The as-synthesized NiSA-N-G with Ni atomic loading of similar to 6 wt% catalysts shows a better activity and stability for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) than NiSA-N-CNT with Ni atomic loading of similar to 15 wt% due to the open and exposed Ni single atom active sites in NiSA-N-G. This study demonstrates for the first time the feasibility in the control of the microstructure of carbon supports in the synthesis of SACs.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2199-692X			WOS:000529198500001		
J	Duan, X. Y.; Li, J. R.; Chang, L. M.; Yang, C. W.								A comparison of electrochemical oxidation performance of PbO2 and SnO2 electrodes								JOURNAL OF WATER REUSE AND DESALINATION				6	3			392	398		10.2166/wrd.2016.150				SEP 2016	2016	PbO2 and SnO2 are two promising anode materials for electrochemical oxidation. In order to highlight the difference between two kinds of electrodes in an electrochemical oxidation process, their morphology, structural, oxygen evolution overpotential (OEP), electrochemical activity and service life-time were compared in detail in this paper. Surface characterization by scanning electron microscope shows that the film of the PbO2 electrode is even, compact, non-porous, and non-cracked, while many cracks are present on the film of the SnO2 electrode. Electrochemical studies based on linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) prove that the OEP for the SnO2 electrode was much higher than that of the PbO2 electrode, and the electron-transfer kinetics and the reversibility of electrode reaction of the SnO2 electrode were superior to those of the PbO2 electrode. In electrochemical decomposition of p-nitrophenol, the degradation ratios at PbO2 and SnO2 anodes achieved 86.9% and 96.5%, respectively, after 120 min electrolysis, which verified the results of LSV and CV. The accelerated lifetime tests show that the service life time of the SnO2 electrode is far shorter than that of the PbO2 electrode, even though it was shown to be superior to the PbO2 in electrocatalytic activity.									10	0	0	0	4	0	10			2220-1319			WOS:000384106100005

The analysis data exhibit no unique component depletion pattern signatures diagnostic of known types of postgeneration physical, chemical, or microbiological degradation processes that commonly affect crude oil in sedimentary rocks. The C9-34 n-alkanes in Paleocene and Upper Cretaceous age coals exhibit bimodal carbon-number distribution profiles that strongly resemble those of the biogenic n-alkanoic acids present in brown coals. The compositional trait similarities between these n-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids and the covariance of the bulk coal organic matter atomic oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) ratios and carbon-preference index (CPI) values offer tangible evidence for the existence of a genetic linkage between these two series of compounds. Our analysis results indicate that the C2-5 alkanes and C6+ hydrocarbons in coals attain their maximum abundances over the thermal maturity interval from 0.50 to 0.72% R-0, which, in turn, strongly suggests that these two groups of compounds are formed concurrently by similar overall reaction processes during coal maturation. The compositional traits of the C4-5 alkanes and C9-34 n-alkanes in coals appear to uniquely mimic those of the alkane products formed by mineral-catalyzed defunctionalization and cracking of n-alkanoic acids, which suggests that mineral catalysis rather than temperature-controlled thermolysis may be a critical variable controlling the formation and compositional traits of natural gas and C9+ n-alkanes during coal maturation. These mechanistic insights should be useful to those seeking to formulate improved geochemical models for predicting hydrocarbon evolution during coal maturation.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000072651600015

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a promising technology designed for this purpose, but its wide application relies significantly on the exploration of both economic and efficient electrode materials. g-C3N4 is a metal-free, low-cost and visible-light responsive semiconductor that shows great potential as a photoelectrode material for PEC water splitting. However, due to the inherent disadvantages of g-C3N4 and the difficulty in fabricating homogeneous and concrete g-C3N4 films, its PEC performance has encountered a bottleneck. For further attention on and breakthroughs in the development of g-C3N4-based photoelectrodes, this review commences with the basic principle of PEC water splitting.

Here, we present a systematic investigation of nickel oxide (NiOx) films prepared from Ni(II) complexes with bidentate L-alanine ligands or monodentate beta-alanine ligands and their potential for use in electrochromic windows. In situ Ni K-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectra show that the chemical structures of the NiOx films in their colored and bleached states are gamma-NiOOH and Ni(OH)(2), regardless of the type of Ni(II)-alanine ligand used. O K-edge XAFS spectra indicate that L-alanine is present only near the surface of the film but not in the bulk of the film, whereas beta-alanine is absent in both. The Ni (II)-L-alanine complex leads to the deposition of a homogenous film with small cluster and grain sizes compared to the Ni(II)-beta-alanine complex; therefore, this film exhibits exceptional electrochromic performance. The coloration efficiency of the film increases by ca. 50% to 74.8 cm(2)/C. The starting oxidation potential of the film is also lower than that of the other films. Further, there was almost no change in optical modulation for the film with an increase in the ambient temperature to 50 degrees C, which suggests that the film deposited from the Ni(II)-L-alanine complex is a potential electrochromic material for smart windows. This work opens new avenues for the use of coordination complexes as metal precursors for the preparation of transition-metal oxide nanostructures.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2574-0970		WOS:000575846000102

The first (3d) series transition metals based LDHs (TM-LDHs) are attracting increasing interest in the field of energy conversion and storage processes due to their unique physicochemical properties. In this article, we review recent developments in the synthesis and applications of TM-LDH in these areas including water splitting, CO2 conversion, metal-air batteries and supercapacitors and the underlying mechanisms of these processes. In addition, current challenges and possible strategies are discussed from the viewpoint of material design and performance.									352	13	1	0	21	1	357			1369-7021	1873-4103		WOS:000375188500015

As these materials are comprised of extended pi-conjugation, their ability to act as light harvesters, and in turn photocatalysts, has come to prominence. The insoluble nature of CPPs allows them to be employed as photocatalysts under heterogeneous conditions, replacing traditional homogeneous systems. This Perspective highlights the current state-of-the-art CPPs along with a view to their applications as heterogeneous photocatalysts for a wide range of chemical transformations including hydrogen production, organic synthesis and photopolymerization, just to name but a few.									103	6	0	0	7	0	103			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000390433700001

The phase exhibits a cubic arrangement of the active metal that forms oxo bridges to the metalloid with possible catalytic participation. The Co3Sb4O6F6 compound proved to be capable of catalyzing 2H(2)OO(2)+4H(+)+4e(-) at 0.33V electrochemical and 0.39V chemical overpotential with a TOF of 4.410(-3), whereas Ni3Sb4O6F6 needs a higher overpotential. Relatively large crystal cubes (0.3-0.5mm) are easily synthesized and readily handled as they demonstrate both chemical resistance to wear after repeated insitu tests under experimental conditions, and have a mechanical hardness of 270V0.1 using Vickers indentation. The combined properties of this compound offer a potential technical advantage for incorporation to a catalytic interface in future sustainable fuel production.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000360583000022	26219925

The mutation Y112F does not affect photosystem II (PSII) activity as compared with control 4 Delta 1K cells. However, the Y112L mutant exhibits a photosynthetically impaired phenotype. PSII activity is not detectable in this mutant when grown at 30 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1), while low levels of the D1 and D2 proteins and oxygen evolution activity are present in the mutant cells grown at a low light intensity (0.5-1 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). The recombination of the Q(B)(-)/S-2,S-3 states of PSII in the Y112L mutant cells as detected by thermoluminescence (TL) is altered, The TL signal emission maximum of these cells due to charge recombination of the S-2,S-3/Q(B)(-) occurs at 20 degrees C as compared to 35-40 degrees C for the wild-type cells, indicating a possible change in the S-2,S-3/Y, equilibrium. The Y112L mutant cells are rapidly photoinactivated and impaired in the recovery of the PSII activity. These results suggest that replacement of the aromatic residue at position Y112 by a hydrophobic amino acid may alter the function of the donor-side activity and affects the degradation and replacement of the PSII core proteins.

POPs can be generally divided into two categories based on their degree of long-range order, including amorphous (e.g., CMPs, HCPs, PIMs, and PAFs) and crystalline (e.g., COFs). Owning to their advantages of light-weight, superior inherent porosity, excellent stability, pre-designable and tunable structures and functions, POPs have received increasing attention and research interest for their tremendous potential applications in gas storage/separation, heterogeneous catalysis, photoelectric conversion, chemical- and bio-sensing, energy storage and conversion, etc. Their porous structure, pore size, specific surface areas and functions can be directly designed and facilely tuned by introducing specific functional building blocks. In this review article, we summarize the latest representative advances in the field of POPs, focusing on their design and synthetic strategies, with emphasis on their specific applications in photocatalysis, including photocatalytic chemical transformation, photodetoxification of contaminants from water, and water splitting.									148	7	0	0	10	0	147				2052-1537		WOS:000513242900002

With the help of online electrochemical mass spectrometry, the complex is demonstrated to be active as a water oxidation catalyst. Comparing the results obtained for different electrode materials shows a clear substrate influence of the electrode, as the complex shows a significantly lower catalytic overpotential on graphitic working electrodes in comparison to other electrode materials. Cyclic voltammetry experiments provide evidence that the structure of complex 1 undergoes reversible changes under high-potential conditions, regenerating the original structure of complex 1 upon returning to lower potentials. Results from electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance experiments rule out that catalysis proceeds via deposition of catalytically active material on the electrode surface.									36	0	0	0	4	0	36			2155-5435			WOS:000424735000039	29430332

Similarly, BiPh3, TFAH, PPh3, and Ag2O react in hexane to form [Bi-4(mu(3)-O)(2)(TFA)(10)(AgPPh3)(2)] n (2). Both contain {Bi-4(mu(3)-O)(2)} units, which have been previously observed with a variety of carboxylate ligands in neutral compounds and anionic compounds. In contrast to other anionic [Bi-4(mu(3)-O)(2)(TFA)N](N-8)-with metal-based countercations, the Ag+ ions in 1 and 2 are directly attached to oxygen atoms of the TFA-ligands bonded to the bismuth core. A crystallographic evolution was observed for 1. Solvent-rich orthorhombic crystals grew initially on standing. However, by three weeks all crystals had converted to a triclinic unit cell that contained no free solvent. The molecular volume decreased from 3146.11 angstrom(3) (orthorhombic) to 2954.06 angstrom(3) (triclinic). The latter had an intermolecular p-p stacking system between silver-and bismuth-bound toluene molecules, which explains the reorganization to a nonsolvated morphology. Compound 2 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P (1) over bar as a coordination polymer through bridging carboxylate ligands. The presence of the PPh3 ligands on Ag+ results in a higher Ag/Bi ratio than in 1. The importance of Ag2O in generating the oxido ligands was confirmed by the isolation of {[Bi-2(TFA)(6)(TFAH)(tol)](2)}(n) (3) from the reaction of BiPh3 with TFAH in toluene in the absence of the metal oxide.									8	0	0	0	3	0	8			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000397852200005

The nanosheet array film would provide large surface area, low resistance and exposed oxygen atoms, facilitating the electrons transport and charge separation. More importantly, the optimized Bi2MoO6 nanosheet array yields a photocurrent density of 220 mu A/cm(2), which is more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of conventional Bi2MoO6 particles (1.8 mu A/cm(2)). Additionally, the nanosheet arrays were modified with ultrathin graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanolayers as co-catalyst to enhance the photo electrochemical activity. As expected, this unique photoanode yields a photocurrent density of 520 mu A/cm(2) at +0.8 V (versus SCE) under visible light irradiation, which is 2.3 times higher than the pure Bi2MoO6 nanosheet film. The origin of enhanced photoelectrochemical activity of the co-catalyst modified film may be due to the large surface area, oriented electrons transport pathways and improved charge separation. These demonstrations clearly reveal that the rationally fabricating of high photoactive nanosheet array and coating ultrathin cocatalysts may serve an alternate strategy toward the development of highly efficient photoanodes for water splitting.

ATCC 51142 is considered a microorganism with the potential to generate sustainable hydrogen in the future. However, few kinetic models are capable of simulating different phases of Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142 from growth to hydrogen production. In the present study four models are constructed to simulate Cyanothece sp batch photoprocluction process. A dynamic optimisation method is used to determine parameters in the models It is found that although the piecewise models fit experimental data better, large deviation can be induced when they are used to simulate a process whose operating conditions are different from the current experiments. The modified models are eventually selected in the present study to simulate a two-stage continuous photoproduction process. The current simulation results show that a plug flow reactor (PFR) shows worse performance compared to a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) in the current operating conditions since it lowers the total hydrogen production. The finding is that nitrate and oxygen concentration change along the direction of culture movement in PFR, and hydrogen is only generated in the zone where both of them are low. The reactor area thereby is not well utilised. Additionally, as hydrogen production rate is primarily influenced by biomass concentration, which increases initially and decreases eventually along the direction of culture movement, the overall hydrogen production rate in a PFR may be lower than that in a CSTR. Finally, in this study fed batch photoproduction processes are proposed containing only one photobioreactor based on the current simulation. (C) 2015 The Authors.

High-voltage aqueous electrolyte based EDLCs are particularly attractive due to their high-power capability, facile production, and environmental advantages. EDLCs should last for thousands of cycles and evaluation of future cell chemistries require long-term and costly galvanostatic cycling. Voltage holding tests have been proposed to shorten evaluation time by accelerating cell degradation processes. Whether voltage holding can replace cycling completely remains undemonstrated. In this work, a systematic investigation of the influence of testing procedure on cell performance is presented. The state-of-the-art post-mortem and operando experimental techniques are implemented to elucidate ageing mechanisms and kinetics inside EDLC cells under different testing procedures. Carbon corrosion occurring on the positively polarized electrode leads to the lower active surface area and higher oxygen content. On the contrary, an increase of surface area and micropore volume are observed on the negatively polarized electrode. Repeated galvanostatic cycles at U<1.6 V appears to facilitate the depletion of oxygen species on the positively polarized electrode in comparison with voltage holding, which indicates a more complex degradation mechanism during cycling. Caution is advised when comparing results from different test procedures.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2196-0216			WOS:000456207200037	31008014

Due to the lack of genomic resources, little is known about the molecular mechanisms associated with immune defense and hypoxia tolerance. Here, we sequenced the transcriptomes of two closely related Marsupenaeus species and compared genomic divergence. This study obtained 77049 and 84561 unigenes with N50 values of 1281bp and 1244bp for M. japonicus and M. pulchricaudatus, respectively, and 5036 pairs of putative orthologs were identified between two Marsupenaeus species. Estimation of Ka/Ks ratios indicated that 165 orthologous genes may be under positive selection (Ka/Ks > 0.5), including 49 pairs with a Ka/Ks ratio > 1. According to the peak of synonymous rates, the divergence time between M. japontcus and M. pulchricaudatus was about 0.26-0.69 Mya. These positively selected orthologous genes related to the immune process mainly comprised single VWC domain protein, legumain, rasrelated C3 botulinum, caspase, C-type lectin and were enriched in functions related to immune (Toll-like receptor and PI3K-Alct signaling) and hypoxia signaling (HIF-1 signaling and VEGF signaling). In this study, dozens of caspase-like unigenes were screened from two Marsupenaeus transcriptomes. Among these, the PjCaspase orthologous gene was subjected to positive selection (Ka/Ks = 1.22), which had different secondary and threedimensional structure prediction. Based on the single copy caspase gene, eight populations of Marsupenaeus species were divided into two phylogeographic lineages from the East and South China. We characterized the transcriptomes of the two Marsupenaeus species and obtained several key orthologs associated with immune defense and hypoxia tolerance, which provides new insights into the immunity and genetic divergence of the two varieties. Moreover, this study will facilitate further comparative genomic studies of the two varieties.									7	0	0	0	6	0	7			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000483634300093	31276791

Different from the pristine g-C3N4, which has scarcely been employed in supercapacitors because of its low charge mobility, the carbon self-repairing g-C3N4 (C-C3N4) shows an improved electrochemical activity. After carbon-repairing, a delocalized big p-bond can be formed by the homogeneous C-substitution for N atoms or the formation of new interstitial C-N bond. The extending p-conjugation planar layer of C-C3N4 possesses a closer contact with GO to form a three-dimensional (3D) pore structure, which ensures good mobility for electrons and quick access for electrolytes. Under the optimum C-repairing content of 5.99 at%, the C-C3N4@rGO exhibited high specific capacity of 379.7 F g(-1) and energy density of 52.7 W h kg(-1) at a current density of 0.25 A g(-1). Moreover, the electrode kept 85% capacity retention after 10 000 cycles at a high constant current density of 10 A g(-1). The active sites of pseudocapacitance can be confirmed in the oxygen-containing groups and the carbon atoms close to the nitrogen by the XPS results.									75	7	0	0	9	0	76			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000384444200028

The results showed that 30 mg/L sulfisoxazole (SIZ) could be completely degraded by PMS (1 mM) activated with CoMnOx@sponge (0.1 g/L) within 5 min. The pseudo-first-order rate constant was calculated to be 1.83 min-1, which was much larger than those from previous reports. The excellent stability and reusability of CoMnOx@sponge were confirmed through 20 recycle runs with more than 90% degradation of SIZ and less than 0.9 mg/L leached metal ions. Singlet oxygen (1O2), hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) and sulfate radicals (SO4 center dot &#xfffd; ) were determined to be the dominating reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsible for the degradation of SIZ. The possible pathways of SIZ degradation as well as underlying catalytic mechanism were deduced. The bio-toxicity declined obviously after the mineralization of SIZ and the removal of TOC at 5 mg/L SIZ was high up to 90.4%. Furthermore, the system of CoMnOx@sponge/PMS also exhibited the strong anti-interference ability in natural water and the universal degradation capacity towards other common organic pollutants. More remarkably, the 3D-catalyst possessing an elasticity and extremely high porosity could be easily assembled with a column to realize the consecutive degradation of pollutants. The labor- and time-saving removal of pollutants based on a combination of CoMnOx@sponge with PMS makes it great potential in practical application.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000810335400004		
J	Liu, Deyu; Chen, Xiuyu; Qiao, Yuepeng; Zhou, Yang; Kuang, Yongbo								Awakening the Photoelectrochemical Activity of alpha-SnWO4 Photoanodes with Extraordinary Crystallinity Induced by Reductive Annealing								ADVANCED ENERGY AND SUSTAINABILITY RESEARCH				3	1					2100146	10.1002/aesr.202100146				JAN 2022	2022	Oxide-based photoelectrodes for solar water splitting have gained growing attention because of their decent stability and cost-effectiveness. Particularly, alpha -SnWO4 has been regarded as a potential next-generation light absorbing material due to the predicted favorable bandgap of 1.9eV. Herein, the investigation and amelioration of the crystallinity as a performance dominating factor to the alpha -SnWO4-based photoanode are demonstrated. The improvement is attributed to a unique crystallization process induced by the formation of oxygen vacancies in the reductive atmosphere at 500 degrees C. The sample exhibits notably enhanced visible-light absorption and an improved charge transport property. Electrochemical measurements reveal a cathodic shift of the flat-band potential, corresponding to the impacted band position. The photocurrent is enhanced from 0.03 to 0.42mA cm(-2) (AM1.5, 1.23 V-RHE). Such a new treatment can be used as an effective tool for developing alpha -SnWO4 into efficient photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) materials.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2699-9412			WOS:000783867000014		
J	Zhou, Yongfang; Shen, Yi; Li, Hongying								Mechanistic study on electro-oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and water molecules via operando surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy coupled with an Fe3+ probe								APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL				317						121776	10.1016/j.apcatb.2022.121776				NOV 15 2022	2022	Electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is a green route to produce value-added chemicals. However, in-depth understanding of the electrocatalytic process is still lacking. Herein, the mechanism of HMF electro-oxidation was studied by operando surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) coupled with an Fe3+ probe. A multicomponent platform consisting of titanium plates integrated with a gold film and uniform nickel, cobalt and copper nanoparticles (NPs) was employed as an electrode as well as a SERS substrate, enabling operando SERS study on the electrocatalytic process with simultaneous evaluation on cata-lytic activity and visualization on the variations of active sites. Fe3+ was intentionally added into the electrolyte as a probe to correlate the nature of active sites with catalytic activity and product selectivity in virtue of its strong interaction with the active sites of the electrocatalysts. Electrodes integrated with Ni and Cu NPs exhibited excellent HMF oxidation performance but their activity were suppressed by adding 1 ppm Fe3+. Conversely, the activity towards water oxidation was significantly enhanced by Fe3+ addition. Fe3+ inhibits the oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+ and promotes the formation of more CuO and CuIII. CuIII is better active sites for water oxidation. The presence of Fe3+ also inhibits the transformation of Co3+ to Co4+, but it has no pronounced effects on HMF oxidation performance. A highest 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid yield (94.0%) and a maximum HMF conversion (98%) are obtained from the electrode integrated with Cu NPs at a potential of 1.47 V. HMF oxidation on Cu NPs follows the aldehyde oxidation pathway, which is not affected by Fe3+ addition. This work could afford a feasible route to explore mechanisms of electrocatalytic processes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000844313200002

Firstly, periodic slab calculations on the basis of density hybrid functionals (PBE0, HSE06) were performed in order to gain insight into the adsorption sites and geometric structure of the surface. For submonolayer coverage of H2O, the molecular adsorption of water is found to be the most stable one with quite similar energetics in PBE0 and HSE06. Moreover, the transition states towards the less preferred dissociative adsorption forms are predicted to be greater than 0.7 eV. Thus, water will not spontaneously dissociate and based on the Computational Hydrogen Electrode model an overpotential of about 1.71 V is needed to drive the overall oxidation. In addition, to validate our results for molecular adsorption of H2O, an embedded cluster model is carefully evaluated for the a-TiO2(101) surface based on the periodic slab calculations. Subsequent high-level DLPNO-CCSD(T) results are in close agreement with our periodic slab calculations since the interaction is found to mainly consist of electrostatic contributions which are captured by hybrid functionals. Finally, first results on optimized geometries in the excited state based on the photogenerated charge-transfer state are presented.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0942-9352			WOS:000534258100003

We have proposed the oxidation of thiosulfate by hydrogen peroxide as this drive. This reaction system behaves as (i) a thermochemical and (ii) a pH oscillator, and in this work, we unify (i) and (ii) for the first time. We report thermally self-consistent, dynamical simulations in which the system transitions smoothly from nearly isothermal pH to fully developed thermo-pH oscillatory regimes. We use this oscillator to drive simulated replication of a 39-bp RNA species. Production of replicated duplex under thermo-pH drive was significantly enhanced compared with that under purely thermochemical drive, effectively allowing longer strands to replicate. Longer strands are fitter, with more potential to evolve enzyme activity and resist degradation. We affirm that concern over the alleged toxicity of hydrogen peroxide to life is largely misplaced in the current context, we survey its occurrence in the solar system to motivate its inclusion as a biosignature in the search for life on other worlds and highlight that pH oscillations in a spatially extended, bounded system manifest as the fundamental driving force of life: a proton gradient.									14	0	1	0	8	0	14			1742-5689	1742-5662		WOS:000361084200005	26202683	
J	Ergut, A; Granata, S; Jordan, J; Carlson, J; Howard, JB; Richter, H; Levendis, YA								PAH formation in one-dimensional premixed fuel-rich atmospheric pressure ethylbenzene and ethyl alcohol flames								COMBUSTION AND FLAME				144	4			757	772		10.1016/j.combustflame.2005.07.019				MAR 2006	2006	This study addresses health-hazardous emissions from combustion of aromatic and oxygenated components of engine fuel blends. An investigation was conducted on the evolution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and other pollutants (soot, CO, unburned light hydrocarbons) emitted from one-dimensional ethylbenzene and ethyl alcohol flames. The study of ethylbenzene combustion is also pertinent to that of waste polystyrene, as past work has indicated that ethylbenzene may be a surrogate for initial products of polystyrene pyrolysis. Both liquid fuels were prevaporized in nitrogen, mixed with oxygen and additional nitrogen, and upon ignition, premixed flat flames were stabilized over a burner. Temperature measurements and product sampling were conducted at various heights above the burner. Results showed that ethyl alcohol combustion generated small yields of PAH, even under the adverse fuel-rich conditions of this study (phi = 2.5). PAH mole fractions in the ethyl alcohol flame were 2-5 orders of magnitude lower than those in the ethylbenzene flame at the same location. PAH mole fractions often peaked in the postflame region and remained at relatively high levels thereafter. PAH mole fractions in premixed fuel-rich benzene, ethane, ethylene, and methane flames, published in the literature, were typically in between those found in the two flames of this study. Computations were conducted using a currently developed detailed kinetic model, allowing for the prediction of formation and depletion of major PAH and soot particles of different sizes. The computed chemical flame structures were compared to experimental data obtained in the present work. Predicted mole fractions were often close to the experimentally obtained values or, at worse, within the same order of magnitude for both fuels. Reaction pathways are discussed.

In this study, we identified the Romo1 homolog from the black rockfish (Sebastes schlegelii), named it as SsRomo1, and characterized it at the molecular as well as func-tional levels. An open reading frame consisting of 240 bp was identified in the SsRomo1 complementary DNA (cDNA) sequence that encodes a 79 amino acid-long polypeptide with a molecular weight of 8,293 Da and a theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of 9.89. The in silico analysis revealed the characteristic features of SsRomo1, namely the presence of a transmembrane domain and the lack of a signal peptide. Homology analysis revealed that SsRomo1 exhibits the highest sequence identity with its fish counterparts (>93%) and shares a similar percentage of sequence identity with mammals (>92%). Additionally, it is closely clustered together with the fish clade in the constructed phylogenetic tree. The subcellular localization analysis confirmed its mitochondrial localization within the fathead minnow (FHM) cells. Under normal physiological conditions, the SsRomo1 mRNA is highly expressed in the rockfish ovary, followed by the blood and testis, indicating the abundance of mito-chondria in these tissues. Furthermore, the significant upregulation of SsRomo1 in cells treated with lip-opolysachharide (LPS), polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, and Streptococcus iniae suggest that the increased ROS production is induced by SsRomo1 to eliminate pathogens during infections. Incidentally, we believe that this study is the first to determine the involvement of SsRomo1 in LPS-mediated nitric oxide (NO) production in RAW267.4 cells, based on their higher NO production as compared to that in the control. Moreover, over -expression of SsRomo1 enhanced the wound healing ability of FHM cells, indicating its high invasion and migration properties. We also determined the hydrogen peroxide-mediated cell viability of SsRomo1-overex-pressed FHM cells and observed a significant reduction in viability, which is possibly due to increased ROS production. Collectively, our observations suggest that SsRomo1 plays an important role in oxidative stress modulation upon immune stimulation and in maintenance of tissue homeostasis in black rockfish.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000828060300003	35580797

The prevailing hypothesis has been that it is created by differences in the UV photolysis rates of different SO2 isotopologues. We investigate here a recently proposed additional source of fractionation during gas-phase formation of elemental sulfur (S-4 and S-8). Because two minor S isotopes rarely occur in the same chain, the longer S-4 and S-8 chains should be strongly, and roughly equally, depleted in all minor isotopes. This gives rise to negative Delta S-33 values and positive Delta S-36 values in elemental sulfur-just the opposite of (and much larger than) what is predicted from SO2 photolysis itself. Back-reactions during chain formation, specifically photolysis of S-2 and S-3, pass sulfur having the opposite fractionation back to atomic S, and thence to other sulfur species, causing H2S, SO2, sulfate, and short-chain elemental sulfur to have positive Delta S-33 and negative Delta S-36. Positive Delta S-33 values in elemental sulfur produced in laboratory SO2 photolysis experiments could be caused by the initial fractionation during photolysis, combined with rapid condensation of short-chain sulfur species on the walls of the reaction chamber, along with a scarcity of back-reactions. The simulated fractionations produced by the chain formation mechanism do not directly match fractionations from the rock record. The mismatch might be explained if the isotopic signals leaving the atmosphere were significantly modulated by life, by uncertainties in the rates of reactions of both major and minor isotopic sulfur species, or by the relatively large potential range of atmospheric parameters. Further work is needed to better constrain these uncertainties, but this novel mechanism suggests new avenues to explore in our search for a explanation for the S-MIF record. (C) 2018 The Authors.

X-ray phi-scan analysis shows that cube-on-cube epitaxy of Co3O4 occurs on MgO(1 0 0) in the temperature range similar to400-550degreesC. Films grown on MgO(1 0 0) at 410degreesC show a rocking curve FWHM of only 0.44degrees, despite a rather large lattice mismatch of 4.1%. This is interpreted to be due to the excellent match between the oxygen sublattices of Co3O4(1 0 0) and MgO(1 0 0). The strong epitaxy which occurs. leads to a low activation energy (E-d) for growth on MgO. Scanning electron microscopy analysis shows faceted grains characteristic of the cubic symmetry of Co3O4, the faceting being stronger at higher growth temperatures. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The effects of various parameters such as pH, current density, supporting electrolyte, and initial phenol concentration were studied. At optimum conditions, it was found that phenol was quickly oxidized into benzoquinone because of the formation of various strong radicals during electrolysis by the Ti/SnO2-Sb2O4 anode from 100 to <1 mg/L over 1 h. The results of GC/MS analysis showed the presence of some esters of organic acid such as oxalic acid and formic acid. HPLC analysis showed only trace amounts of benzoquinone remaining in the solution. The efficiency of TOC removal at the Ti/SnO2-Sb2O4 anode surface showed a degradation rate of 49 % over 2 h. Results showed that the molecular oxygen potential at the electrode was 1.7 V. The phenol removal mechanism at the surface of the Ti/SnO2-Sb2O4 anode was influenced by the pH. Under acidic conditions, the mechanism of electron transfer occurred directly, whereas under alkaline conditions, the mechanism can be indirect. This research shows that the proposed electrolyte can significantly influence the efficiency of phenol removal. It can be concluded that the treatment using an appropriate Ti/SnO2-Sb2O4 electrode surface can result in the rapid oxidation of organic pollutants.									17	1	0	0	7	0	18			0944-1344	1614-7499		WOS:000384555200073	27406226

The characteristics of this signal indicate that it arises from an interaction between an organic radical and the Mn cluster of PSII. The broad radical signal decays in the dark following illumination either by backreaction with Qa(.-) or by forward electron transfer from the Mn cluster. The forward electron transfer (either from illumination at 11 K followed by incubation in the dark at 77 K or by illumination at 77 K) results in the formation of a multiline signal similar to, but distinct from, other well-characterized multiline forms found in the S-0 and S-2 states. The relative yield of the "S1 split signal", which we provisionally assign to S1X., where X could be Y-Z(.) or Car(.+), and that of the 77 K multiline signal indicate a relationship between the two states. An approximate quantitation of the yield of these signals indicates that up to 40-50% of PSII centers can form the S I split signal. Ethanol addition removes the ability to observe the S I split signal, but the multiline signal is still formed at 77 K. The multiline forms with < 700 nm light and is not affected by near-infrared (IR) light, showing that we are detecting electron transfer in centers not responsive to IR illumination. The results provide important new information about the mechanism of electron abstraction from the water oxidizing complex (WOC).									61	0	0	0	51	0	61			0006-2960			WOS:000174592300032	11900555

For comparison, platinum supported on Vulcan carbon (PtC) was also synthesized. These catalysts were evaluated in the NO3- and NO2(NOx) reduction reactions. The addition of W18O49 and ZrO2 to the carbon improved the size and distribution of the platinum nanoparticles. The electrochemical results showed that enhanced electrocatalytic activity for the NOx reduction was obtained on the PtWZC catalyst compared to PtC synthesized by the same technique and PtEtek from a commercial source. Our findings suggest that the adsorbed monatomic hydrogen (H-ads) over platinum inhibits the reduction of nitrates and nitrites. Therefore, these reactions need a material that removes Hads from the surface or modifies it for the NOx reduction. The WZC support adsorbed monatomic hydrogen from water to form active bronze species (H-x-W18O49) that interacted with the NO3- and NO2- ions enabling their reduction, in accord with the results from in-situ Raman spectroscopy and Tafel slopes. N-2, NO, NH3, and N2H4 products were detected in nitrite ion reduction by the Differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) technique on the PtWZC catalyst. The production of N-2 dominated in the cathodic and anodic scan. Hence, the novel catalyst can follow the indirect pathway, where the reduction process involves adsorption of NHx and adsorption of NO. The higher electrocatalytic activity obtained by the PtWZC catalyst was attributed to the uniform distribution of platinum on the support, the increased electrical conductivity produced by the W18O49 nanobelts, and the modulation of H-ads on the surface.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000591690700003

We report deposition of silica (SiO2) onto Ni NPs from tetraethyl orthysilicate (TEOS) through a reverse microemulsion approach, which is accompanied by an unexpected etching process. Ni NPs with an average initial diameter of 27 nm were embedded in composite SiO2-overcoated Ni NPs (SiO2-Ni NPs) with an average diameter of 30 nm. Each SiO2-Ni NP contained a similar to 7 nm oxidized Ni core and numerous smaller oxidized Ni NPs with diameters of similar to 2 nm distributed throughout the SiO2 shell. Etching of the Ni NPs is attributed to use of ammonium hydroxide as a catalyst for deposition of SiO2. Aliquots acquired during the deposition and etching process reveal agglomeration of SiO2 and Ni NPs, followed by dissociation into highly uniform SiO2-Ni NPs. This etching and embedding process may also be extended to other core materials. The stability of SiO2-Ni NPs was also investigated under high-temperature oxidizing and reducing environments. The structure of the SiO2-Ni NPs remained significantly unchanged after both oxidation and reduction, which suggests structural durability when used for catalysis.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000417485000045	29181475

Tomkins et al., Nature 533, 235-238 (2016)] suggested that iron oxides contained in 2.7-Ga iron micrometeorites can be used to determine the concentration of O-2 in the Archean upper atmosphere. Specifically, they argued that the presence of magnetite in these objects implies that O-2 must have been near present-day levels (similar to 21%) within the altitude range where the micrometeorites were melted during entry. Here, we reevaluate their data using a 1D photochemical model. We find that atomic oxygen, O, is the most abundant strong oxidant in the upper atmosphere, rather than O-2. But data from shock tube experiments suggest that CO2 itself may also serve as the oxidant, in which case micrometeorite oxidation really constrains the CO2/N-2 ratio, not the total oxidant abundance. For an atmosphere containing 0.8 bar of N-2, like today, the lower limit on the CO2 mixing ratio is similar to 0.23. This would produce a mean surface temperature of similar to 300 K at 2.7 Ga, which may be too high, given evidence for glaciation at roughly this time. If pN(2) was half the present value, and warming by other greenhouse gases like methane was not a major factor, the mean surface temperature would drop to similar to 291 K, consistent with glaciation. This suggests that surface pressure in the Neoarchean may need to have been lower-closer to 0.6 bar-for CO2 to have oxidized the micrometeorites. Ultimately, iron micrometeorites may be an indicator for ancient atmospheric CO2 and surface pressure; and could help resolve discrepancies between climate models and existing CO2 proxies such as paleosols.									11	0	0	0	5	0	11			0027-8424			WOS:000508977600025	31907311

The method is based on graphene exfoliation in the presence of transition metals (Co2+ and Fe3+) which act as antioxidants, preventing surface oxidation of graphene, while other metals (Ru3+, Mn2+, Ir3+, and Sn4+) act as metal oxide decorators. The addition of Co2+ ions to the exfoliation solution produced few-layer graphene that is two orders of magnitude more conducting and contains 80% less oxygen than the material obtained in the absence of cobalt ion. By contrast, the use of Mn2+ and Ru3+ in the electrolyte form an interconnected honeycomb lamellar structure of MnO2 and RuO2 nanoparticles, respectively. The combination of Mn2+ and Ru3+ create a uniformly grown Ru-Mn oxide hybrid structure on the graphene sheets in a single stage process, which is found to be an efficient electrode for supercapacitors (specific capacitance of 500 F g(-1)) and as a bifunctional water splitting electrocatalyst. The use of these inexpensive salts will aid the scalable production of high-quality graphene and functionalized graphene for diverse applications.									24	1	0	0	0	0	24			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000451118800002

As an exception, glycolate oxidase (GOX) mutants with a photorespiratory phenotype have not been described yet in C3 species. Using Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants lacking the peroxisomal CATALASE2 (cat2-2) that display stunted growth and cell death lesions under ambient air, we isolated a second-site loss-of-function mutation in GLYCOLATE OXIDASE1 (GOX1) that attenuated the photorespiratory phenotype of cat2-2. Interestingly, knocking out the nearly identical GOX2 in the cat2-2 background did not affect the photorespiratory phenotype, indicating that GOX1 and GOX2 play distinct metabolic roles. We further investigated their individual functions in single gox1-1 and gox2-1 mutants and revealed that their phenotypes can be modulated by environmental conditions that increase the metabolic flux through the photorespiratory pathway. High light negatively affected the photosynthetic performance and growth of both gox1-1 and gox2-1 mutants, but the negative consequences of severe photorespiration were more pronounced in the absence of GOX1, which was accompanied with lesser ability to process glycolate. Taken together, our results point toward divergent functions of the two photorespiratory GOX isoforms in Arabidopsis and contribute to a better understanding of the photorespiratory pathway.									54	5	0	0	44	0	58			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000381303300017	27225899

Herein we report a graphene-nanoplatelets-supported (Ni,Fe) metal-organic framework (MOF) as a superior and ultra-durable (>1000 h) anode for alkaline water electrolysis. The MOF on carbon-fiber paper electrodes requires an overpotential eta = 220 mV to achieve a current density j = 10 mA cm(-2) (eta = 180 mV on nickel foam for j = 20 mA cm(-2)) with a Tafel slope of 51 mV per decade, high turnover frequency (1.22 s(-1)), high faradaic efficiency (99.1%), and long-term durability of 41000 h in continuous electrolysis. In an alkaline anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AAEMWE), it exhibits a record current density of 540 mA cm(-2) at 1.85 V at 70 degrees C, outperforming the state-of-the-art Pt/C//IrO2. A breakthrough strategy introduced in membrane electrode assembly fabrication by extending the electrical contact with an aqueous electrolyte offers an additional OH- transport pathway to regenerate the original conductivity of the AAEMWE in continuous electrolysis, without any significant change in the pH of the electrolyte. These findings open up durable, high-performance AAEMWE and direct solar-to-fuel conversion, especially to replace high-cost proton exchange membrane water electrolysis that already works with ultra-pure water.									86	1	0	0	4	0	86			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000579868500037

Perpendicular flow pattern was introduced to steel surface, on which various corrosion behaviors, i.e. oxidation, erosion, and dissolution, were simultaneously detected even at a low fluid rate of similar to 1 m/s after 1000 h. This allowed an investigation into their synergistic effects. Besides, degradation in chemical compositions and mechanical properties was profoundly identified within steel subsurface by means of multi-scale characterization. Role of subsurface degradation in different corrosion failure modes was then elucidated. With regard to breakaway oxidation, an interesting mechanism was proposed for this essential feature of austenitic steels. Plastic deformation microstructure within perpendicularly eroded austenitic steel subsurface, confirmed in other flowing corrosive media, was revealed in liquid LBE flow for the first time and explained in terms of stacking fault energy. Crack across the degraded steel subsurface was proven to be responsible for LBE penetration and selective dissolution attack on steel matrix.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			1044-5803	1873-4189		WOS:000647775100005

TRC1 was found to tolerate Cr(VI) solution up to 500mg/L concentration when grown in mineral salt media. Gene sequencing of the isolated strain using 16S rDNA technique and phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the species was 96% close to Planococcus maritimus (KP8). Studies on cell dynamics in batch bioreactor showed the maximum specific cell growth rate ((max)) to be 0.276h(-1). Removal of Cr(VI) was observed to be dependent on initial chromium concentration and the maximum removal of Cr(VI) (75 +/- 3%) was obtained at 25mg/L Cr(VI) solution for an incubation period of 72h. Above this value, the removal of Cr(VI) was declined. Scanning electron microscope and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic studies indicated that the Cr(VI) removal took place by the adsorption process on the cell outer membrane. It is observed that the adsorption process follows the Freundlich adsorption isotherm (R-2=0.987). Planococcus sp. TRC1 reduced 80 +/- 5% chemical oxygen demand (COD) of tannery effluent (COD 7,270 +/- 45mgO(2)/L) within 48h of batch treatment. The elimination of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity imparted by the raw tannery effluent and Cr(VI) solution after bacterial treatment is an important observation which reflects the eco-friendly behavior of the Planococcus sp. TRC1 mediated tannery effluent and aqueous Cr(VI) solution treatment. The results revealed the applicability of Planococcus sp. TRC1 in both tannery waste and Cr(VI) reduction without affecting our environment.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			1944-3994	1944-3986		WOS:000371813600031

Herein, a series of (010) facets-oriented W18O49 nanowires were controllably synthesized by a facile solvothermal alcoholysis method using octadecylamine as the crystal growth capping agent in order to regulate the specific growth behavior and unveil its correlation with photocatalytic performance. The properties of the prepared W18O49 nanowires, such as surface oxygen vacancies, light absorption and the band gap size, as well as the surface charge carriers separation rate, could be well-modulated via tailoring the preferred orientation growth. The W18O49 nanowire with the strongest (010)-faceted orientation demonstrated the best photocatalytic degradation of Methyl Orange under ultraviolet light irradiation (up to 100% within 15 min) and visible light irradiation (up to 91% within 95 min). These interesting findings not only help us to gain an in-depth understanding of the relationship between the preferred orientation growth and the photocatalytic performance but also have the potential to open up an innovative route/protocols for the preparation of crystal facets-oriented metal oxides for highly efficient photocatalysis.

We now demonstrate the inherent nucleophilicity of those mu(2)-O2- units by showing that the addition of methyl triflate to 1 results in formation of the oxo/methoxo-bridged Mn-IV dimer [{Mn-IV(salpn)}(2)(mu-O,mu-OCH3)](CF3SO3), 3. EXAFS analysis of 3 demonstrates that alkylation of an oxo bridge results in the same structural modification of the [Mn-IV(mu-O)](2) core as an oxo bridge protonation. Electrochemical and spectroscopic comparisons of 3 to 2 indicate that 3 is a good electronic structure analogue for 2 without the complication of proton lability and hydrogen bonding. Indeed, 2 and 3 react nearly identically with hydrogen peroxide and with strong acids. In contrast, the products of their reactions with amines, acetate, and triphenylphosphine are dramatically different. The proton lability of 2 results in simple proton transfer, circumventing the slower redox reactions of these substrates with 3. Isotopic labeling, kinetic, and EPR-monitored radical trap studies lead to a proposed reduction-oxidation mechanistic scheme for the reactions of 3 with amines and triphenylphosphine. The Mn-III product of this reaction, [Mn-III(salpn)(Ph3PO)](CF3SO3), was isolated and crystallographically characterized as a dimerized complex. The redox nature of the reactions is confirmed by trapping of a reduced Mn intermediate which is identified by EPR spectroscopy. Comparison of the reactions of 2 and 3 demonstrates the dramatic effect of proton lability and hydrogen bonding on reactivity, and suggests how metalloenzymes may regulate active site reactivity to produce very different catalytic activities with similar active site structures. Furthermore, it also emphasizes that caution should be used when the reactivity of model compounds with easily and rapidly dissociable protons is assessed.									38	0	0	0	6	0	38			0020-1669			WOS:000083257300029	11671209	
J	Lauretta, DS; Buseck, PR; Zega, TJ								Opaque minerals in the matrix of the Bishunpur (LL3.1) chondrite: Constraints on the chondrule formation environment								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				65	8			1337	1353		10.1016/S0016-7037(00)00615-3				APR 2001	2001	The chemistry and mineralogy of a group of opaque mineral assemblages in the matrix of the Bishunpur LL3.1 ordinary chondrite provide insight into the nebular environment in which they formed. The assemblages consist of a kamacite (Fe,Ni) core that is rimmed by troilite (FeS) and fayalite (Fe2SiO4), Accessory phases in the rims include silica (SiO2), chromite (FeCr2O4), whitlockite (Ca-3(PO4)(2)), maricite (FeNaPO4), magnetite (Fe3O4), and tetrataenite (FeNi). We suggest that the metal melted in and equilibrated with an igneous chondrule under high-temperature, reducing conditions. In this environment the molten alloys incorporated varied amounts of Si, Ni, P: Cr, and Co, depending on the oxygen fugacity and temperature of the melt. Some of the metal was subsequently expelled from the chondrule interiors into the surrounding nebular gas. As the temperature dropped. the alloy solidified and volatile elements corroded the metal. The main reaction products were troilite and fayalite. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations are used to constrain the conditions under which these two phases can form simultaneously in the solar nebula. Kinetic factors are used to place a lower limit on the formation temperature. We determine that the metal corroded between 1173 and 1261 K at a total pressure in the range of 10(-5.0) to 10(-4.1) bars and a dust/gas ratio of 302 to 355 x relative to solar composition. These conditions are consistent with our model that the metal corroded in a dust-rich region of the solar nebula that was cooling after a chondrule formation event.

The probiotic potential of the isolates was evaluated by pH and bile tolerance. Random amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR) was used to confirm the phenotypic identification of isolates. Antioxidant producer isolates were screened by resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS). The antioxidant and antibacterial activities of extracellular materials after 48 h fermentation with antioxidative strains were determined using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and broth microdilution assays, respectively. The results indicate that the antioxidant capacity of supernatants was increased by using of both minimal medium and agitation. The antibacterial activity was increased in minimal medium, but there has nearly no change in the antibacterial properties by using both agitation and minimal medium. The maximum antibacterial activity was observed during mid-exponential phase until the beginning of the early-stationary phase, but the maximum antioxidant activity was detected at the stationary growth phase. There is a significant relationship between antioxidant and antibacterial activities of the cell-free probiotic extracts, and their production rates are closely related to the fermentation type. The bioactive materials from probiotics could be extracted in a large amount at an appropriate time under a suitable condition.									13	2	0	0	10	0	15			0015-5632	1874-9356		WOS:000418143600005	28550367

The entire preparation differs from the traditional sol-gel route employed to prepare nano-TiO2 for it does not require the use of any acid or alkali. The characterization results showed that as-prepared samples were nanoparticles with a diameter of 10-30 nm. Most of the carbon incorporated in the TiO2 matrix exists in the form of elemental carbon, and nitrogen was substituted for some of the lattice oxygen atoms. The PL spectra revealed that carbon and nitrogen dopants could enhance the separation of photo-excited electrons and holes, and improve the photo-catalytic efficiency of TiO2. The conjecture was demonstrated by degrading methyl blue under visible light, using the samples as the photo-atalyst. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Hybrid H-2/Al dust explosions in Siwek sphere								JOURNAL OF LOSS PREVENTION IN THE PROCESS INDUSTRIES				36				511	523		10.1016/j.jlp.2015.03.024				JUL 2015	2015	Explosion indices and explosion behaviour of Al dust/H-2/air mixtures were studied using standard 20 1 sphere. The study was motivated by an explosion hazard occurring at some accidental scenarios considered now in ITER design (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor). During Loss-of-Vacuum or Loss-of-Coolant Accidents (LOCA/LOVA) it is possible to form inside the ITER vacuum vessel an explosible atmosphere containing fine Be or W dusts and hydrogen. To approach the Be/H-2 explosion problem, Be dust is substituted in this study by aluminium, because of high toxicity of Be dusts. The tested dust concentrations were 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1200 g/m3; hydrogen concentrations varied from 8 to 20 vol. % with 2% step. The mixtures were ignited by a weak electric spark. Pressure evolutions were recorded during the mixture explosions. In addition, the gaseous compositions of the combustion products were measured by a quadruple mass-spectrometer. The dust was involved in the explosion process at all hydrogen and dust concentrations even at the combination '8%/100 g/m3'. In all the other tests the explosion overpressures and the pressure rise rates were noticeably higher than those relevant to pure H-2/air mixtures and pure Al dust/air mixtures. At lower hybrid fuel concentrations the mixture exploded in two steps: first hydrogen explosion followed by a clearly separated Al dust explosion. With rising concentrations, the two-phase explosion regime transits to a single-phase regime where the two fuel components exploded together as a single fuel. In this regime both the hybrid explosion pressures and pressure rise rates are higher than either H-2 or Al ones. The two fuels compete for the oxygen; the higher the dust concentration, the more part of O2 it consumes (and the more H-2 remains in the combustion products). The test results are used to support DUST3D CFD code developed at KIT to model LOCA or LOVA scenarios in ITER. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We propose to trace changes in the oxygenation state of the ocean during the early Aptian anoxic event using the redox-sensitive trace-element (RSTE) distribution, phosphorus accumulation rates (PARs) and organic-matter characterization in three different basins of the western Tethys. The following sections have been investigated: Gorgo a Cerbara (central Italy) in the Umbria Marche basin, Glaise (SE France) in the Vocontian basin and Cassis/La Bedoule (SE France) located in the Provencal basin.In the Gorgo a Cerbara section, RSTE distributions show a low background level along the main part of the section, contrasted by different maxima in concentrations within the Selli level. In the Glaise section, the Goguel level displays a weak increase in RSTE contents coeval with moderate TOC values. At Cassis/La Bedoule, no significant RSTE enrichments have been observed in sediments equivalent to the Selli level. These differences in the records of the geochemical proxies of the Selli level or its equivalent indicate the deposition under different redox conditions, probably related to the paleogeography. Our data indicate the development of anoxic-euxinic conditions in the deeper part of the Tethys during OAE 1a, whereas in the shallower environments, conditions were less reducing. Moreover, at Gorgo a Cerbara, the Selli level is characterized by rapid changes in the intensity of reducing conditions in the water column. Ocean eutrophication seems to be a major factor in the development and the persistence of anoxia as suggested by the PAR evolution. Higher PAR values at the onset of OAE 1a suggest an increase in nutrient input, whereas the return to lower values through the first part of the OAE 1a interval may be related to the weakened capacity to retain P in the sedimentary reservoir due to bottom-water oxygen depletion. This general pattern is contrasted by the data of Gorgo a Cerbara, where the sediments deposited during the OAE 1a interval show P-enrichments (mainly authigenic P). This is associated with maxima in TOC values and C-org:P-tot ratios, suggesting that a part of the remobilized P was trapped in the sediments and as such prevented from returning to the water column.

J	Ingalls, Miquela				Ingalls, Miquela/AAJ-2645-2020	Ingalls, Miquela/0000-0002-7451-2944			Reconstructing carbonate alteration histories in orogenic sedimentary basins: Xigaze forearc, southern Tibet								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				251				284	300		10.1016/j.gca.2019.02.005				APR 15 2019	2019	Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry (T(Delta(47))) and the oxygen stable isotope record (delta O-18) provide critical constraints on the temperature of carbonate mineral formation and isotopic composition of ancient waters used in reconstructions of past climate, tectonics, and ecological and environmental change. The robust use of these proxies requires that carbonate minerals in the rock record retain primary isotopic compositions through often complex post-depositional thermal histories. New carbonate clumped isotope thermometry and sedimentology data are paired with existing thermochronology and isotope exchange reaction modeling to provide unique constraints on the alteration history of the carbon and oxygen isotopes in Tethyan marine carbonates (Jialazi Fm, Tso Jianding Group) of the Xigaze forearc, southern Tibet. Within the framework of the textural and isotopic data, the effects of early and late burial alteration on Delta(47) and delta O-18 values of marine rocks that were buried to <6 km and uplifted to >4 km above sea level are modeled. The alteration products are considered within two well-studied mechanistic frameworks: water-rock recrystallization and solid-state reordering of C-13-(18)Obonds at high temperature. The proposed alteration model is as follows: (1) shallow, early diagenesis with water of similar composition and temperature to formation waters infills primary porespace with microspar; (2) high-temperature, rock-buffered water-rock exchange and partial solid-state reordering at >3-4 km depth; and (3) near-surface, low-temperature water-rock exchange on the exhumation pathway. The Delta(47) heterogeneity within individual samples (0.456 to 0.721) requires significant differential alteration on the retrograde path (high to low temperature, low water-rock ratio) in which primary compositions and compositions inherited during early burial diagenesis are overprinted with modern meteoric values. A low T(Delta(47) ) value is often assumed to record the primary temperature of the depositional environment. However, samples yielding low T(Delta(47)) values in the Jialazi Fm have undergone extensive high-temperature water-rock alteration, and therefore, require a mechanism for increasing(13)C-O-18 bond ordering on the retrograde pathway while preserving many primary biogenic structures and micritic textures. This study highlights the potential significance of late-stage, low-temperature alteration of carbonates derived from orogenic sedimentary basins for studies of terrestrial paleoenvironments and tectonics. This study also provides an example framework for combining observational and analytical data to reconstruct a carbonate alteration history of a buried sedimentary package. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The apparent quantum yield for this reaction has been improved, but the lifespan of photocatalysts functioning under sunlight at ambient pressure have rarely been examined, despite the critical importance of this factor in practical applications. Herein, we show that Al-doped SrTiO3 (SrTiO3: Al) loaded with a RhCrOx (rhodium chromium oxide) cocatalyst splits water with an apparent quantum yield greater than 50% at 365 nm. Moreover, following the photodeposition of CoOOH and TiO2, this material maintains 80% of its initial activity and a solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency greater than or equal to 0.3% over a span of 1300 h under constant illumination by simulated sunlight at ambient pressure. This result is attributed to reduced dissolution of Cr in the cocatalyst following the oxidative photodeposition of CoOOH. The photodeposition of TiO2 further improves the durability of this photocatalyst. This work demonstrates a concept that could allow the design of longterm, large-scale photocatalyst systems for practical sunlight-driven water splitting.									98	4	0	0	6	0	98			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000461228400001	30996901

The observed catalytic activities result from an interplay between the intrinsic adsorption properties of platinum surfaces and their interaction with the aqueous environment. Although water networks have been extensively studied on close-packed surfaces, little is known about high-coverage solvation environments around defects. Here, we report DFT calculations on medium- to high-coverage water adsorption structures near the (100) step edge on Pt(533). We find that isolated ring structures adjacent to step edges form hexagons or pentagons. For higher coverages, 6 possible adsorption structures with varying ring sizes along the step edge and almost identical adsorption energies are observed. From our results we conclude that the favorable interaction of the H-down oriented water molecules, adjacent to the step edge, with the step dipole plays an important role in the formation of these structures. Furthermore, our results explain why water networks on stepped surfaces originate at the step edges, and extend towards the adjacent terraces, in agreement with previous experiments. These results show how step edges act as anchoring points for water adsorption and suggest that solvation of defects might dominate water structures on real platinum surfaces.									28	0	0	0	2	0	28			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000369508100006	26327406	
J	Park, YR; Ripley, EM; Severson, M; Hauck, S								Stable isotopic studies of mafic sills and proterozoic metasedimentary rocks located beneath the Duluth Complex, Minnesota								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				63	5			657	674		10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00083-6				MAR 1999	1999	Thin (3-20 m), picritic to noritic sills are found in the Proterozoic metasedimentary footwall rocks of the Duluth Complex, Minnesota. The sills were emplaced prior to the major intrusions that comprise the Duluth Complex, and underwent contact metamorphism along with the country rocks. Oxygen, hydrogen, and sulfur isotopic compositions of the sills indicate a varied history of isotopic exchange between minerals, melts, and hydrothermal fluids in the high temperature environment below the major plutonic bodies of the Midcontinent Rift system. The pre-Duluth Complex sills exhibit a range in delta(18)O values from 4.9 parts per thousand to 14.8 parts per thousand, with values between 6 parts per thousand and 7 parts per thousand generally found in sill interiors. High delta(18)O values near sill contacts with high O-18 metasedimentary rocks of the pelitic Virginia Formation or Biwabik iron Formation, coupled with a smooth sigmoidal isotopic profile centered at the contact, suggest that oxygen diffusion was an important exchange mechanism. The elevated delta(18)O values near the center of the thickest sills are thought to reflect the emplacement of isotopically contaminated basaltic magma. Dehydration reactions in the pelitic rocks of the contact aureole liberated high O-18 fluids that enhanced subsolidus diffusive exchange. Advective displacement of the diffusion profiles toward the sill interior is less than 40 cm, and suggests that layer pal allel flow dominated in the dehydration of the contact aureole. Elevated, but uniform delta(18)O values (9.7 parts per thousand to 10.5 parts per thousand) in thinner sills suggests that oxygen diffusivity was increased relative to country rocks due to enhanced porosity, perhaps related to extensive development of microcracks. Although delta D values of the pelitic country rocks record a history of dehydration, systematic variations of delta D (- 64 parts per thousand to - 143 parts per thousand) and H2O (0.15 to 5.40 wt.%) content are not found in the sills. delta(18)O values of coexisting plagioclase and pyroxene from the sills indicate a close approach to isotopic equilibrium. and are consistent with a diffusion-dominant exchange process at temperatures near 500 degrees C. Results of diffusion modelling suggest a duration of isotopic exchange that may have extended from tens of thousands of years to 1.4 Ma, depending on local controls of porosity and permeability, as well as rates of fluid production in the contact aureole.Localized areas of O-18 and D depletion in the sills (values as low as 4.9 parts per thousand and -143 parts per thousand, respectively) denote exchange with meteoric water after interaction with the high O-18 metamorphic fluids in the contact aureole. Although all of the elevated O-18 samples in the contact environment may have suffered O-18 depletion, most exchange with meteoric water appears to be spatially localized, and is thought to reflect highly channelized, fracture-controlled fluid flow. Sulfur isotopic values of the sills are variable (-2.7 parts per thousand to 11.2 parts per thousand), and indicative of an evolution involving pre-emplacement contamination of basaltic magma, and sub-solidus exchange with an H2S-bearing metamorphic fluid. Sulfur contents exceed 3.0 wt.% only within troctolitic to melatroctolitic sills, and delta(34)S values of 7.8 parts per thousand to 8.3 parts per thousand are strongly suggestive of pre-emplacement contamination by sulfur derived from a Proterozoic sedimentary unit. High delta(18)O and delta(34)S rocks, particularly at sill margins, are consistent with either hydrothermal precipitation of fine-grained sulfide minerals, or isotopic exchange between magmatic sulfides and an H2S-bearing metamorphic fluid.

XAS has demonstrated its usefulness in determining the electronic and geometric structures of supported single atom catalysts thanks to its high sensitivities towards elemental, chemical, and orbital determination. Nowadays, it is expected that the role of XAS will further increase as current research interests are shifting to more complex size-selected single-or multi-element atomic clusters, including challenging electrochemical processes. This review discusses the latest applications of XAS in characterization of electrocatalysts with atomic dispersion, such as single atoms and clusters. Involved advanced analyses methods like wavelet transform, as well as outlooks and challenges for revealing the dynamic behaviours of catalytic active sites using in-situ XAS are also presented and discussed.									15	1	0	0	3	0	15			2451-9103			WOS:000471288800004

Electrochemical Water Oxidation with Cobalt-Based Electrocatalysts from pH 0-14: The Thermodynamic Basis for Catalyst Structure, Stability, and Activity								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY				133	36			14431	14442		10.1021/ja205647m				SEP 14 2011	2011	Building upon recent study of cobalt-oxide electrocatalysts in fluoride-buffered electrolyte at pH 3.4, we have undertaken a mechanistic investigation of cobalt-catalyzed water oxidation in aqueous buffering electrolytes from pH 0-14. This work includes electrokinetic studies, cyclic voltammetric analysis, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic studies. The results illuminate a set of interrelated mechanisms for electrochemical water oxidation in alkaline, neutral, and acidic media with electrodeposited Co-oxide catalyst films (CoO(x)(cf)s) as well as for a homogeneous Co-catalyzed electrochemical water oxidation reaction. Analysis of the pH dependence of quasi-reversible features in cyclic voltammograms of the CoO(x)(cf)s provides the basis for a Pourbaix diagram that closely resembles a Pourbaix diagram derived from thermodynamic free energies of formation for a family of Co-based layered materials. Below pH 3, a shift from heterogeneous catalysis producing O-2 to homogeneous catalysis yielding H2O2 is observed. Collectively, the results reported here provide a foundation for understanding the structure, stability, and catalytic activity of aqueous cobalt electrocatalysts for water oxidation.									578	11	0	0	65	0	580			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000295193700049	21806043

The diagenetic history of these sandstones has greatly impacted the reservoir quality, resulting in a high heterogeneity in porosity and permeability. To investigate this impact, sixty thin sections and rock samples were investigated through petrographic observations, geochemical microanalysis, and X-ray diffraction. Three main diagenetic events occurred during burial and influenced the reservoir properties: (1) mutual growth of chlorite, siderite, and apatite, (2) calcite cementation, and (3) dissolution of K-feldspar and calcite. Early diagenesis occurs under strongly reducing conditions, leading to the formation of Fe-chlorite/berthierine, siderite, pyrite, and apatite forming coatings around the detrital grains. Chlorite coatings have a key role in controlling the reservoir quality in the Agat Formation. In the lower part of the reservoir, chlorite forms thick coats (15-25 mu m) that strongly reduce permeability. Conversely, in the upper part of the reservoir, chlorite coats are thinner (4-10 mu m), favoring porosity preservation by inhibiting quartz overgrowth. X-ray diffraction and electron microscope observations indicate Fe-rich chlorite of Ib polytype, suggesting solid-state transformation from a berthierine precursor. The kinetics of berthierine/chlorite growth are governed by the dissolution of Fe-rich grains and fine fraction materials found as matrix and early coats. These grains are abundant in the lower part of the reservoir favoring the formation of thick chlorite coats. Chlorite was followed by pervasive calcite cementation in deep burial conditions creating low permeability barriers in the reservoir. The source of this calcite is internal and probably related to the dissolution of an early diagenetic calcite cement forming at shallow depth, with a minor contribution from marine carbonates. During late diagenesis, K-feldspar grains and calcite cements underwent intense dissolution creating secondary porosity and consequently increasing permeability. The input of acidic fluids associated with the maturation of the source rocks could have facilitated these dissolution reactions. Our results highlight the importance of inherited mineralogy in controlling the distribution of chlorite, carbonates, and secondary porosity in the Agat Formation. This study provides useful indicators to help predict diagenetic reactions that can occur in deep marine silici-clastic reservoirs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0264-8172	1873-4073		WOS:000809239000001

In this communication, we report the in situ surface derivation of an Fe-Co-Bi layer (4-7 nmin thickness) on an Fe-doped Co3O4 nanowire array supported on carbon cloth (Fe-Co3O4/CC). As a 3D catalyst electrode for water oxidation, such a core-shell FeCo3O4@Fe-Co-Bi nanoarray (Fe-Co3O4@Fe-Co-Bi/CC) demonstrates superior activity over that of a Co3O4-derived nanoarray catalyst, with the need of an overpotential of 420 mV to drive a geometrical catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M potassium borate (pH = 9.2). Notably, this catalyst also shows good long-term stability with high turnover frequencies.									68	3	0	0	1	0	68			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000398323400004

One plasmonic photocatalyst, Au/TiO2, is of a particular interest because it combines chemical stability, suitable electronic structure, and photoactivity for a wide range of catalytic reactions such as water splitting. In this review, we describe key mechanisms involving plasmonics to enhance photocatalytic properties leading to efficient water splitting such as production and transport of hot electrons through advanced analytical techniques used to probe the photoactivity of plasmonics in engineered Au/TiO2 devices. This work also discusses the emerging strategies to better design plasmonic photocatalysts and understand the underlying mechanisms behind the enhanced photoactivity of plasmon-assisted catalysts.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16				2079-4991		WOS:000593828500001	33203122

There is a late Neoproterozoic-Cambrian granulite-facies metamorphic overprint on the charnockite massif This study examines whether orthopyroxene in the charnockites crystallized during the original magmatic stage or formed during the later high-grade metamorphic event. The textural association of orthopyroxene and relic garnet grains, and reaction intergrowths of garnet and/or biotite with orthopyroxene, similar to those reported in dehydration zones within the gneisses surrounding the charnockite massif, show that orthopyroxene in the charnockite massif formed during the late high-grade metamorphic event from dehydration reactions and is not part of the original igneous assemblage. Metasomatic textures such as thin K-feldspar rims, together with the presence of CO2-rich fluid inclusions in these rocks; suggest that CO2 metasomatism, widely prevalent in the gneisses surrounding the massif, probably resulted in the low water activity necessary to firm orthopyroxene during the metamorphic overprint. An oxygen isotope traverse along a metapelite enclave charnockite contact within the massif shows a distinct variation in delta O-18 values, with the charnockite away from the contact having the lowest delta O-18 value (+8.9 parts per thousand) similar to that of typical metaluminous granitic rocks. The charnockite at the contact shows an intermediate 8180 value (+10.3 parts per thousand) and the surrounding metapelite has the highest delta O-18 value (+12 parts per thousand), the intermediate delta O-18 value indicates partial assimilation of metapelite with a high delta O-18 value into the charnockite with a low delta O-18 value. Both the garnet-absent and garnet-bearing charnockites have similar compositional ranges to tonalite-granodiorite-granite (TTG) suites. Irrespective of whether garnet is present or not, the Sr contents of the charnockites show a bimodal distribution: a high-Sr group, which is magnesian, calcic to calc-alkalic, metaluminous, showing TTG affinities, and a low-Sr group, which is dominantly ferroan, calcic to calc-alkalic, metaluminous, showing similarities to the orthopyroxene-bearing dehydration zones. Petrogenetic characterization suggests that the protoliths of the Nagercoil charnockites were high-temperature melts of hydrous basalt.									52	7	0	0	2	1	53			0022-3530	1460-2415		WOS:000287337600006

Though the market for PEM electrolyzer systems is growing, there are concerns that the cost and availability of precious metal catalysts utilized in today's commercial systems can limit deployment. Herein, we show that while the availability of Ir should not impede deployment in the near term, the inelasticity of the Ir commodity price is cause for immediate concern. We emphasize that diversifying catalyst materials, even with other precious metals, can reduce system costs and mitigate supply chain risk. Furthermore, we analyze the trade-offs between catalyst capital cost and catalyst activity for a range of operating conditions (i.e., capacity factor, electricity price). The framework presented herein is a first step toward establishing performance targets (i.e., activity, stability, material cost) for reduced precious metal and non-precious metal catalysts as a function of PEM electrolyzer operating conditions.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2380-8195			WOS:000769973900003

Herein, iron sulfide particles were prepared via a modified polyol method by changing the ethylene glycol (EG) : water (H2O) ratio in the mixed solvent. Analytical techniques and electronic microscopy studies confirmed that the change in EG : H2O ratio modulated the crystal structure, morphology, and electronic structure of the prepared iron sulfide particles. The electrocatalytic activity of iron sulfide changed owing to these modulations. EG helped in the formation of a sheet-like structure - a morphology that favours a higher accessibility to the catalytically active sites. As evidenced form electrochemical impedance studies, an increased electron density near the Fermi level, a faster substrate adsorption-desorption rate at the active sites, and a faster charge transfer at the electrode-electrolyte interface were the key factors for the amplification in catalytic activity. The prepared iron sulfide particles showed an overall water splitting efficiency that is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art RuO2-Pt/C couple in alkaline medium. This study shows the potential of the polyol method in the preparation and catalytic-activity modulation of Fe-S-based electrocatalysts.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2196-0216			WOS:000475465600030

In this study, an easily recoverable, environmentally friendly and highly transparent floatable magnetic photocatalyst carrier was prepared based on biopolymer alginate and Fe3O4 particles. Further, three different types of photocatalysts were chosen as model semiconductor photo catalysts and loaded on the shell of the carriers. The freeze process facilitated the formation of internal cavities that enhanced floating ability and transparency of the spheres. Meanwhile, the excellent floating performance offered massive reaction sites for pollutants reacting with photocatalysts, O-2 and photons on the air/water interface. Photodegradation results showed all three floatable hybrid photocatalysts exhibited enhanced photocatalytic efficiencies compared to the virgin photocatalysts. In short, the carrier can integrate excellent floating ability, environmental friendliness and full recycling with good stability, and it can greatly improve the photocatalytic efficiency of various powder semiconductor photocatalysts.									10	1	0	0	2	0	11			0144-8617	1879-1344		WOS:000604617100001	33357857

In particular, regulating the surface structure of shells to maximize the atomic utilization efficiency of noble metals is critically important. Controlling the shell thickness of noble metal catalysts at the atomic level as an efficient approach to realize this goal has been attracting growing attention; this approach involves the formation of ultrathin shells (typically 2-6atomic layers), monolayers, or even atomically dispersed noble metals embedded in the host metal. These strategies drive the core/support metals to improve the number of active sites and the intrinsic activity of the deposited noble metals remarkably, meanwhile minimizing the usage of noble metals. Herein, recent advances regarding atomic control of the core-shell noble metal catalysts is reviewed, with focus on the surface regulation. First, synthesis methods and surface structures are summarized, and then catalytic applications of these architectures are highlighted.									16	3	0	0	0	0	16			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000468855200003	30484919

Albitization dominates in environments of low H2O activity, Le., halite saturated systems. Chloritization, serpentinization and formation of smectites seems to be related to less saline systems, i.e., enhanced water activity.The Rotliegend brines of the North German Basin evolved by interaction of infiltrating halite brines with volcanic debris of the Permian acid volcanic rocks by albitization and chloritization of plagioclase. At present their temperatures are between 130 and 150 degrees C at 3000-4000 m depth. Although they developed in a different environment they chemically and isotopically resemble the basinal brines from the Mississippi Salt Dome basin or even the deep brines from the Red Sea. All these brines have in common that halite brines interacted with plagioclase (An + SiO2 + 2Na(+) double left right arrow 2Alb + Ca2+) or possibly with clay minerals (Ca-clay + 2Na(+) double left right arrow Na-2-clay + Ca2+) at enhanced temperatures. The trends of stable isotopes show slopes in the delta D-delta O-18 diagram which are typical for hydrothermal reactions of evaporation brines with rock or sediments. The genesis of Rotliegend brines differ from Ca-Cl brines in the Canadian Shield, Siberian Platform, the Dry Valleys in Antarctica and even the local brines from the Chilean salars and the Californian Bristol Dry Lake. The Antarctic Dry Valley brines seem to be dominated by melting of ice-cements of their permafrost sections. The Ca-Cl brines of springs in the Chilean salars and the Bristol Dry Lake ascend due to thermal convection along tectonic faults. Although the Canadian Shield brines chemically resemble those of the Siberian Platform their stable isotope fractionation suggest that they developed by different processes of water abstraction. Exotic stable isotope values in brines are gained by freezing or ultrafiltration processes in the precursor sediments of the present crystalline rocks of the Canadian Shield and by small volume ratios of liquids and metamorphic rocks such as of KTB/VB.									7	0	1	0	0	0	7			0009-2541	1872-6836		WOS:000401878900004

Using corrosion to fabricate various nanoporous metal structures								CORROSION SCIENCE				92				16	31		10.1016/j.corsci.2014.12.017				MAR 2015	2015	Dealloyed nanoporous metals have attracted increasing interest owing to their fascinating properties and important applications. In this review, we summarized recent advance in fabricating various nanoporous metals and nanoporous metal-based composites through alloy corrosion (i.e., dealloying) and/or combined with other strategies such as electrochemical oxidation and deposition. Particularly, we discussed how the precursor composition, dealloying conditions, and post treatment would affect the nanoporous structure; and how to control the nanoporous structures (such as hierarchical nanoporous structures) based on these understanding. We also provided some characterizations, size-dependent properties, and outlook on future research in this fascinating area. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The structures and morphologies of the as-prepared nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, which revealed the formation of Pt-Co alloys during the co-reduction process. PtxCoy alloy nanoparticles were applied as catalysts in lithium-air batteries. Through electrochemical testing, we found that the Pt based alloy nanocatalysts significantly increased the specific capacity of lithium-air batteries and the increase of Co content in PtxCoy alloy nanoparticles further enhanced the catalytic activity. This result illustrated that PtxCoy alloy nanoparticles could be used as an efficient catalyst material for lithium-air batteries with the feature of much reduced cost, but drastically increased catalytic activity.

The X-ray diffraction ( XRD) analysis demonstrates that RuO2 films were crystallized in the rutile phase and scanning electron microscopy investigations indicated the formation of a smooth surface. Cyclic voltammetry and EQCM studies were performed simultaneously in order to investigate the charging processes of the RuO2 films in 0.1 M HClO4. The voltammetric and mass versus potential responses present three well-defined regions associated with the RuO2 redox couples. Based on these results and on the mass-charge relationships, the corresponding charging mechanisms are proposed. In the potential region governed by the Ru3+/Ru4+ redox couple, the mass-charge relation can be associated with the double-injection of protons and electrons. The other regions correspond to water release and oxyhydroxide species formation during charging.									34	1	0	0	0	1	34			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000226895800004

A deposit of blue and colorless gem corundum (Beluga occurrence) is compared to a similar calc-silicate pod generally lacking corundum but containing nepheline (Bowhead occurrence) and located 170 m to the SSW. Corundum formation was made possible by three equally important sequential metamorphic reactions: (1) formation of nepheline, diopside, and K-feldspar (inferred) at granulite facies peak metamorphic conditions; (2) partial retrograde replacement of the peak assemblage by phlogopite, oligoclase, calcite, and scapolite (Me-50-Me-67) as a result of CO2-, H2O-, Cl-, F-bearing fluid influx at 1782.5 +/- 3.7 Ma (P-T < 720 degrees C, 6.2 kbar); and (3) retrograde breakdown of scapolite + nepheline (with CO2-and H2O-bearing fluid) to form albite, muscovite, corundum, and calcite. Late, low-temperature zeolite mineralization is common in corundum-bearing zones. Based on thermodynamic models, the corundum-forming reaction only occurs in a <100 degrees C window with an upper limit determined by scapolite-nepheline stability, and a lower limit determined by the formation of Al-silicate rather than corundum. The protolith is inferred to be dolomitic argillaceous marl with no evidence to suggest the initial presence of evaporites. The enrichment of trace metals V and Cr, and the depletion of Co, Ni, and Mn, suggest reducing diagenetic conditions in the initial sediment. Beluga calc-silicate rock is strongly depleted in REE (Total REE similar to 18 ppm). Oxy-dravite delta B-11 (+3.9 +/- 0.7%) is consistent with a marine boron source. The oxygen isotope composition of corundum (delta O-18(VSMOW) = 16.4 +/- 0.1%) is comparable to that of corundum in marble or desilicated pegmatite associated with marble. Phlogopite and muscovite Ar-40/(39) Ar ages and calculated closure temperatures (considered estimates) are ca. 1640 Ma (T-c = 455 to 515 degrees C) and 1510 Ma (Tc = 410 to 425 degrees C), respectively. In the Lake Harbour Group, the most prospective areas for gem corundum exploration are expected to be contiguous to the thrust fault separating the Lake Harbour Group and Narsajuaq terranes, where the retrograde, amphibolite facies overprint of the granulite peak assemblages was most pervasive.									8	0	0	0	2	0	9			0008-4476	1499-1276		WOS:000406369600008

Nanorods of diameter about 35nm and length about 300nm have been vertically grown on an FTO substrate. Upon calcination, the FeOOH phase could be easily converted to a hematite structure while maintaining the shape of the nanorod array. An interesting abnormal cathodic photocurrent is generated on the FeOOH nanorod-array photoelectrode under illumination, which is totally different from that obtained on a calcined hematite photoelectrode under the same experimental conditions. The cathodic photocurrent density generated on the FeOOH photoelectrode can also be tuned by applying an electrochemical anodic or cathodic treatment. Detailed analysis has revealed that higher valence state Fe-IV species in the FeOOH photoelectrode play an important role in sacrificing the photoexcited electrons for generation of the cathodic photocurrent. Comparison between the FeOOH and hematite photoelectrodes allows for a better understanding of the interplay between crystal structure, surface reactions, and photocurrent. The findings on this new abnormal phenomenon could also provide guidance for the design of new types of semiconducting photoelectrochemical devices.									6	1	0	0	2	0	7			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000373163100023	26879339	
J	Newton, Robert C.; Tsunogae, Toshiaki					Tsunogae, Toshiaki/0000-0003-1606-5717			Incipient charnockite: Characterization at the type localities								PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH				253				38	49		10.1016/j.precamres.2014.06.021				OCT 2014	2014	Fifty years after the discovery of incipient charnockite (orthopyroxene-bearing granitic rocks) partially replacing amphibole-biotite gneiss in southern India, this phenomenon has been found in transitional amphibolite facies to granulite facies terrains on every continent, and may be a characteristic feature of progressive deep-crustal metamorphism. The alteration is essentially a metasomatic transformation. Mass balance calculations for localities in southern India and Sri Lanka for which analytic data are most comprehensive show that the main reaction producing orthopyroxene in orthogneiss is breakdown of hornblende by reaction with biotite, with loss of FeO, MgO, TiO2, and CaO, as well as H2O from the host rock. There is concomitant gain of SiO2. No significant change of alkalis can be demonstrated as essential to the transformation, though advanced charnockitic alteration at the type locality of Kabbal, Karnataka may also show large increase of K2O, with removal of mafic constituents.Very similar orthopyroxene-bearing veins in garnet-biotite gneiss at the Ponmudi type locality in Kerala show definite, but more subtle metasomatism, with loss of FeO and MgO and increase of SiO2 and alkalis. Both the Kabbal and Ponmudi alterations occurred at mid-crustal levels: 5-6 kbar and 700-750 degrees C.It is postulated that both types of charnockitic alteration may have been produced as open-system processes by much the same kind of metasomatizing fluids - nearly coeval CO2-rich and ultrasaline fluids, based on fluid inclusion evidence. The paragneiss alteration is mainly biotite breakdown with some involvement of garnet, and leads to a distinct metamorphic facies type. The presence of graphite in some of the garnet-biotite gneisses at Ponmudi would have resulted in lower oxygen fugacity and, probably, lower H2O activity than in the similar Kabbal-type metamorphism. The fluid/rock ratios for both types were small (about 10 mass percent of the rocks), and the fluids, whatever their origin, were largely rock-governed.The source of the metasomatizing fluids has not been definitely identified. Carbon isotopes of fluid inclusions seem to show an igneous or primitive mantle source at both type localities, but ultrasaline fluids may be more plausibly explained by metasedimentary sources, and calcareous metasediments have been identified as a source of CO2 in some occurrences. Much remains to be learned about incipient charnockite and its significance in processes of crustal evolution. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, through simple deposition of layered double hydroxides (LDH) on Co3O4/NF (NF= nickel foam) nanosheets arrays, hierarchical Co3+-rich materials based on LDH-Co3O4/NF are prepared as highly active and stable electrocatalysts for water splitting. The NiFe-LDH-Co3O4/NF demonstrates excellent electrochemical activity with an overpotential of 214 mV for the OER and an overpotential of 162 mV for the HER at 10 mAcm(-2). Such a performance is attributed to the optimized electronic states with a high concentration of Co3+, which improves the intrinsic activity, and the sheet-on-sheet hierarchical structure, which increases the number of active sites. The unique synchronous design of both the architectural and electronic structure of nanomaterials can simultaneously accelerate the reaction kinetics and provide a more convenient charge transfer path. Therefore, the strategy reported herein may open a new pathway for the design of excellent electrocatalysts for water splitting.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000606936700001	32909649

Inhibiton of all photosynthetic activities require 3 min of preincubation in the light before inhibition is observed. The results indicate that compounds 3 and 4 behave as Hill reaction inhibitors. alpha-Photogedunin acetate 3 inhibits PS II electron flow from H2O to DCBQ without affecting PS I electron transport from reduced DCPIP to MV and PSII from water to SiMo. Therefore, its target is localized at the Q(B) level. beta-Photogedunin acetate 4 inhibits PS I electron flow from reduced DCPIP to MV, PMSred to MV, and TMQH(2) to MV without affecting PS II electron flow, interacting at the b(6)f level and in the span of P-700 to F-x.									23	0	0	0	15	2	23			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000074993100064

The samples were synthesized using a simple one-stage hydrothermal method. The samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), diffused reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and the nitrogen absorption/desorption technique. The activity of the products on the photocatalytic degradation of an aqueous Rhodamine B (RhB) solution was then investigated under visible light irradiation. The results showed the higher photocatalytic efficiency of the hybrid Bi2WO6/BiOBr sample compared to that of other compounds, as approximately 97% of RhB molecules were degraded after 80 minutes of irradiation in the presence of this sample. Under the same conditions, pure Bi2WO6 and hybrid samples of Bi2WO6/BiOCl and Bi2WO6/BiOI, respectively, degraded 40%, 60% and 20% of dye molecules in the solution. The better performance of this sample compared to that of the others can be explained by its larger effective surface area and the strong interaction between Bi2WO6 and BiOBr. Furthermore, a test conducted to determine active species in photocatalytic reactions showed that superoxide radicals played the main role in the degradation of RhB molecules by hybrid Bi2WO6/BiOBr photocatalyst.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0256-1115	1975-7220		WOS:000605641700019

Uniform microstructures were observed in the sections longitudinal and transverse to rolling direction in terms of porosity, pore size, gas permeability and filtration efficiency. IrO2 nanowire arrays were coated onto the powder-rolled porous Ti substrate as an electrode by thermal decomposition. Characterisation results show that the coating mainly exhibited mixture of IrO2 and alpha-Ti phases. The coating of IrO2 nanowire arrays effectively increased the specific surface area of the IrO2/Ti electrode and reached over 95% of current efficiency. The cyclic voltammetry test of the electrode showed an obvious redox peak due to its increased specific surface area by the porous Ti substrate.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			0032-5899	1743-2901		WOS:000384496000004

This province includes the sedimentary stratiform deposit at Mount Gunson and the giant granite breccia- and hematite breccia-hosted Olympic Dam deposit.Drill holes have intersected the Pandurra Formation and an unconformably underlying sequence of tuffs, siltstones, volcanic breccias, and felsic, intermediate, and mafic igneous rocks. Metasediments and a basal brecciated granite were also intersected in one drill hole. The chemistry of the mafic and intermediate volcanics is similar to ultrapotassic and potassic rocks associated with continental tensional regimes (e.g., high K and Fe2O3/FeO ratios, and relatively high Mg, Ba, Cr, Ni, Rb, Zr, Ce, La, and Y contents). Chemical, mineralogical and textural features indicate that Si, Ca, Fe, Na, K, and Cu were mobile and Mg, Al, P, Pb, and Zn relatively inert. Copper values (mostly <20 ppm) are lower than values typical of basaltic rocks, suggesting that Cu has been removed from the system during the circulation of hydrothermal fluids and alteration of primary Fe-Ti oxide, Cu sulfide, and ferromagnesian silicate minerals.Fluid inclusion studies show the presence of both NaCl-CO2-rich and CaCl2-rich fluids. The former are in early replacement segregations of quartz, fluorite, and orthoclase, whereas the Ca-rich fluids are associated with a later, but possibly overlapping, hydrothermal event resulting from the interaction of magmatic fluids and fluids released during decarbonation reactions.The delta-C-13 values of vein and amygdule-filling carbonate in the igneous rocks indicate a dominance of magmatic fluids, with variable addition and mixing of carbon from either solution and/or reaction of sedimentary carbon. Sulfide mineral delta-S-34 values suggest a magmatic sulfur source. The delta-S-34 values of pyrite from drill hole PY3 (1.9 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand) are within the range for sulfide minerals from mafic and ultramafic igneous rocks.Geochemical trends associated with Cu (U, Pb, Zn) mineralization in South Australian Proterozoic rocks indicate it was derived from a mafic to intermediate igneous source. Hydrothermally thermally altered Gawler Range volcanic and subvolcanic rocks in the region are likely source rocks for these metals.									9	1	0	0	0	0	10			0361-0128			WOS:A1992JC64800004

The electrocatalytic activity of the CoS/RGO nanohybrids was evaluated towards the detection hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The physiochemical properties of the prepared composite was characterized by means of field emission scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction patterns. The CoS/RGO modified electrode showed superior electrocatalytic activity towards the detection of H2O2. The amperometric (i-t) studies revealed that the CoS/RGO performed well by attaining a wide linear response range of H2O2 from 0.1 to 2542.4 mu M with a lower detection limit 42 nM and the sensitivity of 2.519 mu M-1 cm(-2). Meanwhile, the CoS/RGO nanohybrids exhibited good selectivity, rapid and stable response towards H2O2. The practical applicability of the sensor was successfully evaluated in human serum and urine samples with satisfactory recoveries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

New improvements on the electrochemical properties of electrode materials can be achieved by exploiting the much better performance of alpha-nickel hydroxide. Such materials were obtained in a stable form by sol-gel method and characterized by thermogravimetric analyses, UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance techniques. The results revealed not only the formation of the alpha-Ni(OH)(2) phase, but also a much better electrochemical reversibility and stability as compared with similar materials obtained by electrochemical precipitation method.									30	1	0	0	5	2	31			1533-4880	1533-4899		WOS:000290692400034	21780396	
J	SOLOMON, PR; FLETCHER, TH; PUGMIRE, RJ								PROGRESS IN COAL PYROLYSIS								FUEL				72	5			587	597		10.1016/0016-2361(93)90570-R				MAY 1993	1993	The heterogeneous nature of coal and 'the complexity of the pyrolysis process have made it very difficult to perform unambiguous experiments to determine the rates and mechanisms in coal pyrolysis. However, recent years have seen a number of new experimental and theoretical approaches which shed new light on the subject. This paper considers the recent progress on kinetics, the formation of volatile products, network models, cross-linking, rank effects, and the 'two-component' model of coal structure. Recent experiments which measured coal particle temperatures at high heating rates provide reasonable agreement on kinetic rate constants. These rates also agree with those derived from experiments at low heating rates. In tar formation and transport, a consensus is being reached on the central role of the volatility of tar molecules in explaining the variation with operating conditions (pressure, heating rate, particle size, etc.) of the amounts and molecular weight distributions of tars. Progress in the quantitative prediction of tar and char yields is being made through recently developed models for the fragmentation of the macromolecular coal network. These models, which provide quantitative descriptions of the relations between the chemical structure of the coal and the physical and chemical properties of the pyrolysis products (gas, tar, soot, and char), are an exciting advance in the understanding of the pyrolysis process. Such models are linking the occurrence of the plastic phase of the coal with the 'liquid' fragments formed during pyrolysis. On the subject of retrogressive cross-linking reactions, both solvent swelling and n.m.r. measurements confirm important rank-dependent differences in reaction rates; these appear to be related to the oxygen functionalities. Reasonable agreement is also seen for variations with coal rank of kinetic rates derived from measurements at low heating rates. Experiments suggest that the recently revived 'two-component' hypothesis of coal structure has application to low-rank coals, which are mixtures of two distinct components: polymethylenes and a more aromatic network. Bituminous coals, however, appear far more homogeneous. Although experiments can distinguish loosely and tightly bound fractions these fractions appear to consist of similar materials and are differentiated primarily in their molecular weight and degree of connection to the network. These coals appear to behave in a manner that is described by the network decomposition models.									246	32	1	0	6	1	275			0016-2361			WOS:A1993KY98900001

We have examined the function of the highly conserved Ala(251) D1 residue in this domain in chloroplast transformants of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and found that Arg, Asp, Gin, Glu, and His substitutions are nonphotosynthetic, whereas Cys, Ser, Pro, Gly, ne, Val, and Leu substitutions show various alterations in D1 turnover, photosynthesis, and photoautotrophic growth. The latter mutations reduce the rate of Q(A) to Q(B) electron transfer, but this is not necessarily rate-limiting for photoautotrophic growth. The Cys mutant divides and evolves O-2 at wild type rates, although it has slightly higher rates of D1 synthesis and turnover and reduced electron transfer between Q(A) and Q(B). O-2 evolution, D1 synthesis, and accumulation in the Ser, Pro, and Gly mutants in high light is reduced, but photoautotrophic growth rate is not affected. In contrast, the ne, Val, and Leu mutants are impaired in photoautotrophic growth and photosynthesis in both low and high light and have elevated rates of D1 synthesis and degradation, but D1 accumulation is normal. While rates of synthesis/degradation of the D1 protein are not necessarily correlated with alterations in specific parameters of PSII function in these mutants, bulkiness of the substituted amino acids is highly correlated with the dissociation constant for Q(B) in the seven mutants examined. These observations imply that the Ala(251) residue plays a hey role in D1 protein.									25	0	0	0	21	0	25			0021-9258			WOS:000073395200045	9556593

To this end, highly active, durable, and inexpensive photocathodes that operate under conditions compatible with those for photoanodes are desired. Herein, Si based composite photocathodes were constructed by coating the front surface of Si with an N-doped carbon nanolayer and then a TiO2 protective layer, followed by decorating the electrode surface with Ni and Ni-Mo catalysts. The carbon nanolayer, denoted as C-PDA, was formed directly on the Si surface by in situ self-polymerization of dopamine, followed by carbonization of the polydopamine (PDA) coating. The performance of the as fabricated Si photocathodes with and without the C-PDA layer was comparatively studied for PEC hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline electrolytes to evaluate the effect of the sandwich C-PDA layer in between the Si substrate and the TiO2 layer on the photoelectrocatalytic behaviors of Si-based electrodes. The photocathodes containing the C-PDA layer demonstrated lower electron transfer resistance, higher built-in photovoltage, and larger band bending relative to the analogous electrodes without the C-PDA layer. Accordingly, the short-circuit photocurrents of the Ni and Ni-Mo-decorated photocathodes with the C-PDA layer were enhanced by a factor of 2.8-3.3, and their open-circuit photovoltages were enlarged by 0.14-0.22 V, compared to those of the corresponding electrodes without the C-PDA layer in 1 M KOH under simulated 1 sun illumination. Moreover, the photocathodes with the C-PDA layer also exhibited an improved stability for PEC HER in alkaline solutions, with a faradaic efficiency of 90-97% in the initial hour.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000470034700027	31062963

It is a challenge to develop a single photocatalyst having all functions so as to lower the efficiency loss. Herein, the active GaN4 site is integrated into a polymeric carbon nitride (CN) photocatalyst (GCN), which displays an excellent H-2 production rate of 9904 mu mol h(-1) g(-1). It is 162 and 3.3 times higher than that of CN with the absence (61 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) and presence (2981 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)), respectively, of 1.0 wt % Pt. Under light irradiation the electron is injected and stored at the GaN4 site, where the LUMO locates. The HOMO distributes on the aromatic ring resulting in spatial charge separation. Transient photovoltage discloses the electron-storage capability of GCN. The negative GaN4 promotes proton adsorption in the excited state. The positive adsorption energy drives H-2 desorption from GaN4 after passing the electron to the proton. This work opens up opportunities for exploring a novel catalyst for H-2 production.									47	2	0	0	3	0	48			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000612704200001	33471365

It is considered to be one of the more promising alternate options for the conventional Haber-Bosch cycle. Herein, 2D g-C3N4 composites with modifying ultrathin sheet MnO2-x were prepared and used as nitrogen fixation photocatalyst. With the assistance of the nature of MnO2-x, the generation rate of NH3 reached 225 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), which is more than twice over the rate of pristine 2D g-C3N4 (107 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)). The presence of ultrathin sheet MnO2-x shortens the gap of the carriers to the surface of photocatalyst. Thus the speed of electron transfer gets increased. Besides, the construction of Z-scheme heterojunction boosts the separation and migration of photogenerated carriers. As a result, the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) performance gets enhanced. The work may provide an example of promoting the NRR performance of non-metallic compound. (C) 2021, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Inspired by theoretical predictions, we herein validated the existence of a strong electrostatic affinity between polymeric carbon nitride (p-C3N4) and LiPSs, that can not only stabilize the redox cycling of LiPSs, but also enhance their redox kinetics. As a result, utilization of p-C3N4 in a Li-S battery has brought much improved performance in the aspects of high capacity and low capacity fading over prolonged cycling. Especially upon the application of p-C3N4, the kinetic barrier of the LIPS redox reactions has been significantly reduced, which has thus resulted in a better rate performance. Further density functional theory simulations have revealed that the origin of such kinetic enhancement was from the distortion of molecular configurations of the LiPSs anchored on p-C3N4. Therefore, this proof-of-concept study opens lip a promising avenue to improve the performance of Li-S batteries by accelerating their fundamental electrochemical redox processes, which also has the potential to be applied in other electrochemical energy storage/conversion systems.									127	9	0	0	4	0	128			1944-8244			WOS:000384518500028	27598825

The formation of the CuO/OMS-2 nanocomposites significantly increases NO conversion and N-2 yield for the reduction of NO by CO. The CuO/OMS-2 nanocomposite with the optimum Cu/Mn molar ratio of 0.569 (CuO/OMS-2-C) exhibited excellent catalytic activity at lower temperature below 300 degrees C, which is much better than a commercial precious metal catalyst (0.84 wt% Pd/MgO-Al2O3-SiO2). Compared to the commercial precious metal catalyst, T-50 and T-90 (the reaction temperature corresponding to 50% and 90% of NO conversion) of CuO/OMS-2-C are significantly reduced by Delta T-50 = 126 degrees C, Delta T-90 = 100 degrees C, respectively. Even at the low temperature of 240 degrees C, the N-2 yield of CuO/OMS-2-C is as high as 93.8%. In striking contrast, the N-2 yield of the pure OMS-2 nanorod sample and the commercial precious metal catalyst is as low as 3.6%, 8.0% at 240 degrees C, respectively. CuO/OMS-2-C exhibited excellent durability for the reduction of NO by CO. Even after operated at 300 degrees C for 140 h, the catalytic activity almost remained unchanged. The evolution of the catalytic active phases or sites for CuO/OMS-2-C with the elevation of the reaction temperature was investigated by CO temperature-programmed reduction, TEM, XRD, and XPS. When the temperature increases above 240 degrees C, the catalytic active phases of the CuO/OMS-2 nanocomposites are reconstructed to metallic Cu and Mn3O4. These characterizations reveal that the formation of the CuO/OMS-2-C nanocomposite considerably promotes the reduction of OMS-2 to catalytic active phase of Mn3O4 as well as the reduction of CuO to catalytic active phase of metallic Cu. The more active catalytic sites of Mn3+ ions and metallic Cu in the CuO/OMS-2-C nanocomposite produced at lower temperature together with the synergetic effect between Mn3O4 and metallic Cu significantly improve the NO conversion and N-2 yield as compared to pure OMS-2 and nano CuO.

PCC 6803. Nine mutants with one, four mutants with two, and four mutants with three His mutations in CP47 have been generated and characterized. Mutation of any one of seven different His residues to Tyr leads to slower photoautotrophic growth and apparent destabilization of the PS II complex. Mutations introduced into multiple His residues in one mutant exhibited a cumulative effect. Replacing His by Asn leads to a much smaller effect than observed upon mutation to Tyr. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the mutated His residues are chlorophyll ligands: Asn can substitute as chlorophyll ligand, whereas Tyr cannot. Further evidence supporting a role of the mutated His residues in chlorophyll binding comes from measurements of the light intensity needed to half-saturate oxygen evolution. All His mutants with impaired PS II function needed higher light intensities for half-saturation than wild type. A possible explanation for this decrease in antenna efficiency in the mutants is a loss of the Mg in the chlorophyll due to a loss of the fifth ligand, and thus the formation of a pheophytin molecule in the antenna. We conclude that conserved His residues in hydrophobic regions of CP47 indeed are chlorophyll ligands and that these ligands are important for PS II stability as well as efficient antenna function.									41	5	0	0	35	0	45			0006-2960			WOS:A1993LC72100019	8494886

Layer double hydroxides (LDHs) composed of first-row transition metals with empty d-orbitals are theoretically promising for N-2 electroreduction (NRR) but rarely reported. Herein, hollow NiCo-LDH nanocages with different Ni/Co ratios were prepared, and their electronic structures and atomic arrangements were critical. The synergetic mechanisms of Ni and Co ions were revealed, and the optimized catalytic sites were proposed. Besides, in-situ Raman spectroscopy and N-15(2) isotopic labeling studies were applied to detect reaction intermediates and confirm the origin of NH3. As a result, high NH3 yield of 52.8 mu g h(-1) mg(cat)(-1) and faradaic efficiency of 11.5 % were obtained at -0.7 V, which are top-ranking among Co/Ni-based NRR electrocatalysts. This work elucidates the structure-activity relationship between LDHs and NRR and is instructive for rational design of LDH-based electrocatalysts.									0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000755356000001	35170239

CHEMICAL SCIENCE				13	1			14	26		10.1039/d1sc04775b		NOV 2021		DEC 22 2021	2021	As we are in the midst of a climate crisis, there is an urgent need to transition to the sustainable production of fuels and chemicals. A promising strategy towards this transition is to use renewable energy for the electrochemical conversion of abundant molecules present in the earth's atmosphere such as H2O, O-2, N-2 and CO2, to synthetic fuels and chemicals. A cornerstone to this strategy is the development of earth abundant electrocatalysts with high intrinsic activity towards the desired products. In this perspective, we discuss the importance and challenges involved in the estimation of intrinsic activity both from the experimental and theoretical front. Through a thorough analysis of published data, we find that only modest improvements in intrinsic activity of electrocatalysts have been achieved in the past two decades which necessitates the need for a paradigm shift in electrocatalyst design. To this end, we highlight opportunities offered by tuning three components of the electrochemical environment: cations, buffering anions and the electrolyte pH. These components can significantly alter catalytic activity as demonstrated using several examples, and bring us a step closer towards complete system level optimization of electrochemical routes to sustainable energy conversion.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000721514400001	35059146

Herein, single-atom Pt catalyst supported on holey ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets (Pt-CNHS) was synthesized via a facile liquid-phase reaction of g-C3N4 and H2PtCl6. The single-atom Pt can achieve high dispersibility and stability, which can promote the utilization efficiency as well as enhance the electrochemical activity. When employed as Li-O-2 batteries' cathode catalyst, Pt-CNHS exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity. Li-O-2 batteries utilizing Pt-CNHS show much higher discharge specific capacities than those with pure CNHS. Li-O-2 batteries with Pt-CNHS cathode can be cycled stably for 100 times under the discharge capacity of 600 mAh g(-1). Based on experimental results and density functional theory calculations, the superior electrocatalytic activity of Pt-CNHS can be ascribed to the large surface area, the enhanced electrical conductivity and the efficient interfacial mass transfer through Pt atoms and porous structure of CNHS.

A key requirement for the photochemical oxidation of water on both nanostructured alpha-Fe2O3 and TiO2 is the generation of photoholes with lifetimes on the order of milliseconds to seconds. Here we use transient absorption spectroscopy to directly probe the long-lived holes on both nc-TiO2 and alpha-Fe2O3 in complete PEC cells, and we investigate the factors controlling this slow hole decay, which can be described as the rate-limiting step in water oxidation. In both cases this rate-limiting step is tentatively assigned to the hole transfer from the metal oxide to a surface-bound water species. We demonstrate that one reason for the slow hole transfer on alpha-Fe2O3 is the presence of a significant thermal barrier, the magnitude of which is found to be independent of the applied bias at the potentials examined. This is in contrast to nanocrystalline nc-TiO2, where no distinct thermal barrier to hole transfer is observed.									220	7	0	0	21	0	222			0002-7863			WOS:000292715600040	21553825

From the isotopic studies, the delta H-2/delta O-18 ratios revealed that groundwater is of meteoric origin through vertical recharge and mixing processes. The isotopic depletion along the west-east transect is due to mixing and fractionation processes. Generally, the d-excess value approximated the y-intercept of global meteoric water line of 10, which ruled out the influence of secondary evaporative processes on isotopic variation. Hierarchical cluster analysis identified four distinct clusters (C1, C2, C3 and C4) in the study area. Among these four clusters, it was observed that C1 had relatively high median concentrations of Fe (716.7 mu g/L), Cr (0.85 mu g/L), Pb (7.90 mu g/L) and Sb (3.80 mu g/L), while C2 was characterized by high levels of Cu (3.20 mu g/L). Cluster 3 was comparably defined by high median levels of F (1.00 mg/L) and Mn (338 mu g/L), while C4 revealed high median concentrations of As (8.70 mu g/L), Ba (635 mu g/L), Li (22.2 mu g/L), Ni (2.80 mu g/L), Se (6.20 mu g/L) and Sr (677 mu g/L). Clusters C1 and C4 described a flow path along the North Rukuru River, which is characterized by higher levels of evaporites as shown by higher concentrations of Na, K, Cl and SO4. It was also observed that this path was defined by high levels of HCO3 and total hardness. The principal component analysis suggests that carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering are the main mineralization control mechanisms. Furthermore, it is revealed that samples in the west had higher factor scores for As, Ba, Li, Ni, Se and Sr (with higher TDS), while the eastern is characteristic of higher heavy metals (Fe and Pb). Geochemical modeling using PHREEQC showed that surface complexation reactions significantly impact trace elements of higher redox state. In addition, inverse modeling confirms the significance of carbonate dissolution, silicate weathering and cation exchange processes along the North Rukuru River flow path.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1866-6280	1866-6299		WOS:000376589500030

Particles of Ir formed on the surface of SiO2 microspheres were well crystalline similar to the pure Ir nanoparticles. Both the glassy carbon electrodes modified by Ir nanoparticles and Ir@SiO2 composite microspheres showed weak electrochemical activities toward oxidation of dopamine and ascorbic acid. However, the Ir nanoparticles modified gold electrode displayed an obvious catalytic activity toward electrooxidation of either dopamine or ascorbic acid. For the gold electrode modified with Ir@SiO2 composite microspheres, the electrochemical behavior could be affected obviously by the quantity of the electrocatalyst on the surface of bare gold electrode. The relationship between structure and property of both samples have been studied and analyzed based on the experimental data.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000407841800118

ILs possess the potential of overcoming the limitations of conventional synthesis approaches. Due to their unique characteristics such as high chemical and thermal stabilities, nearly negligible vapour pressure, wide electrochemical window, broad liquidus range, tunable polarity, hydrophobicity/ hydrophilicity, ionic liquids are opening new frontiers in the ionothermal synthesis of tailored materials, enabling products that are difficult or impossible to achieve by using other, more conventional preparation routes. Trying to offer an exhaustive review on the burgeoning role of ionic liquids for the synthesis and processing of energy conversion materials, this perspective article focuses on IL-assisted production of electrode materials and catalysts for fuel cells, photo-induced water splitting and dye-sensitized solar cells. A brief excursion on the use of ionic liquids for the processing of natural fuels for biofuel cells is also made. The state-of-the-art research endeavours are firstly evaluated, followed by the exploration of future research directions with some thoughts on emerging challenges and opportunities.									87	2	0	0	10	0	87			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000367622700003

Very recently, with the development of preparation/modification technology and deeper understanding of the electrochemical mechanisms, BN-based nanomaterials have made significant progress in the field of electrochemistry. Exploiting the characteristics of BN for advanced electrochemical devices is expected to be a breakthrough that will stimulate a new energy revolution. Owing to its chemical and thermal stability, as well as its high mechanical strength, BN can alleviate various inherent problems in electrochemical systems, such as thermal deformation of conventional organic separators, weak solid electrolyte interface layers of metal anodes, and electrocatalyst poisoning. The integration of BN with various electrochemical energy technologies is systematically summarized from the perspectives of material preparation, theoretical calculations, and practical applications. Moreover, the challenges and prospects for the future development of BN-based electrochemistry are highlighted.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000690693200001

As is expected from the theoretical calculations, relatively large thermopower of S similar to 700 mu V K-1 is observed at room temperature in the parent compound CuCoO2, whereas the resistivity is too high even in the doped compounds compared with other thermoelectric oxides. The high-temperature transport is thermal-activation type characterized by two energy gaps, Delta(rho) and Delta(S), which are estimated from the resistivity and the thermopower, respectively. In the parent compound, we obtain Delta(rho) similar to 0.47 eV and Delta(S) similar to 0.38 eV. We find that Delta(rho) is larger than Delta(S) in all the samples, implying a mobility gap opening due to a grain-boundary scattering.

Among these materials, the ingenious and effective combination of the mechanical and functional properties of MXenes provides a promising opportunity for designing flexible and wearable devices. This review summarizes the recent research progress in the structural stabilities, mechanical strength and deformation mechanism, strain-tunable energy storages, and catalytic and thermoelectric properties along with certain strain modifications and strain-controllable electronic/topological properties of MXenes from a combined theoretical and experimental perspective and illustrates their electronic origins. Taking the design principles as a focus, the theoretical predictions provide guidance, while the experimental work gives a thorough validation, thus setting the foundation for the current scientific achievements, challenges, and prospects in the field of MXenes.									149	3	0	0	14	0	148			0009-2665	1520-6890		WOS:000502687900005	31710485

They offer many attractive properties which are linked to the transition character of the base element, i.e. molybdenum, and high chemical activity of sulphur, an element of the oxygen family. Significant progress in our understanding of the processes involved in nucleation, growth, and shaping of molybdenum disulphide nanoparticles was achieved, and the mechanisms underlying their biological properties and catalytic activity were investigated; however, many questions remain. In this topical review, a number of representative examples are used to illustrate recent progress in nucleation and growth of various molybdenum disulphide nanostructures with the aim to provide a snapshot of the spectrum of practically important fabrication methods, from simplest solution-based techniques to the most advanced chemical vapour deposition and plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition techniques. We then review the most promising applications of these nanostructures in medicine, focusing on anti-cancer therapy, drug delivery and medical imaging, with the key advantages and opportunities presented by molybdenum disulphide nanoparticles and composites over other similar materials and nano-architectures. The outlook section focuses on present challenges in the synthesis, e.g. sophisticated control over particle structure and chemical activity, as well as advanced biomedical applications of molybdenum disulphide nano-structures, and proposes some strategies to overcome these challenges and problems.									34	2	0	0	3	0	35			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000459985700001

Several groups have therefore intensified their research efforts towards the implementation of suitable diagnostic tools and accelerated stress test (AST) protocols that mimic cell reversal events. However, the current number of different test protocols requires consolidation and harmonization to define durability targets towards cell reversal tolerance and to benchmark newly developed materials. To create a basis for harmonization, this study examines the difference between pulsed and quasi-continuous AST protocols at the catalyst-coated membrane level. Utilizing a single-cell setup combined with an on-line mass spectrometer, a 2.5-fold increase in the carbon corrosion rates were found for short-pulsed compared to long-lasting cell reversal events. The enhanced corrosion was associated with a 2.2-fold higher loss of electrochemically active surface area and a 15% higher reduction in anode catalyst layer thickness. By contrast, the overall cell performance decreased additionally by 40-50 mV for samples under long-lasting cell reversal events. The decay is mainly driven by an increased ohmic resistance, presumably originating from a more pronounced surface oxide formation on the carbon support.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000565741700001		
J	Richter, Oliver; Mestl, Gerhard								Deactivation of Commercial, High-Load o-Xylene Feed VOx/TiO2 Phthalic Anhydride Catalyst by Unusual Over-Reduction								CATALYSTS				9	5					435	10.3390/catal9050435				MAY 2019	2019	An unusual temporal behavior of the by-product spectrum, as well as the temperature profiles of a commercial phthalic anhydride reactor, indicated a non-typical change of the incumbent catalyst. In order to understand these observations, catalyst samples were taken from this reactor and analyzed by standard physico-chemical methods. Catalyst samples from another commercial reference reactor with most similar operating conditions and catalyst lifetime were also taken for comparison. The detailed physical analysis did not indicate unusual thermal stress leading to catalyst deactivation by rutilisation or sintering of the titania phase. The chemical analysis did not reveal significant amounts of any of the known catalyst poisons, which would also contribute to an untypical catalyst deactivation/behavior. Quantitative X-ray diffraction measurements on the other hand revealed an unusually high degree of reduction of the vanadium species in the final polishing catalyst layer. Such an abnormal degree of catalyst reduction, and hence, irreversible damaging, was concluded to likely originate from a unit shutdown without sufficient air purging of the catalyst bed. Combustion analysis of the deactivated catalyst confirmed unusually high carbon contents in the finishing catalyst bed (L4) accompanied with a significant loss in the specific surface area by plugging the catalyst pores with high-molecular carbon deposits. According to the well-known Mars-van-Krevelen-mechanism, o-xylene and reaction intermediates remain adsorbed on the catalyst surface in case of a shutdown without air purging and will continue to consume lattice oxygen, accordingly reducing the catalytic species. This systematic investigation of used catalyst samples demonstrated the importance of sufficient air purging during and after a unit shutdown to avoid abnormal, irreversible damage and thus negative impact to catalyst performance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2073-4344			WOS:000472678500044

A soluble copper-bipyridine water-oxidation electrocatalyst								NATURE CHEMISTRY				4	6			498	502		10.1038/NCHEM.1350				JUN 2012	2012	The oxidation of water to O-2 is a key challenge in the production of chemical fuels from electricity. Although several catalysts have been developed for this reaction, substantial challenges remain towards the ultimate goal of an efficient, inexpensive and robust electrocatalyst. Reported here is the first copper-based catalyst for electrolytic water oxidation. Copper-bipyridine-hydroxo complexes rapidly form in situ from simple commercially available copper salts and bipyridine at high pH. Cyclic voltammetry of these solutions at pH 11.8-13.3 shows large, irreversible currents, indicative of catalysis. The production of O-2 is demonstrated both electrochemically and with a fluorescence probe. Catalysis occurs at about 750 mV overpotential. Electrochemical, electron paramagnetic resonance and other studies indicate that the catalyst is a soluble molecular species, that the dominant species in the catalytically active solutions is (2,2'-bipyridine)Cu(OH)(2) and that this is among the most rapid homogeneous water-oxidation catalysts, with a turnover frequency of similar to 100 s(-1).									604	19	0	0	58	0	610			1755-4330	1755-4349		WOS:000304393500017	22614386

To investigate mineral evolution and structural incorporation of cations in simplified experiments, aluminosilicate solids were precipitated homogeneously at room temperature from batch solutions containing a 1:1 molal ratio of Si to Al and 10(-3) molal Sr and/or Cs, and aged for 30 or 548 days. Syntheses were done with solutions in equilibrium with atmospheric CO2 and with gas-purged solutions. Experimental products were characterized by bulk chemical analyses, chemical extractions, XRD, SEM/TEM, TGA, solid-state Al-27 NMR, and Sr EXAFS. Chemical analysis showed that solids had a 1:1 Al:Si molar ratio, and that Sr was sequestered at higher amounts than Cs. After 30 days of aging in purged solutions, XRD showed that zeolite X (faujasite-type) was the only crystalline product. After aging 30 and 548 days in solutions equilibrated with atmospheric CO2, a mixture of sodalite, cancrinite, and minor zeolite X were produced. Surface areas of solids at 30 days were much lower than published values for zeolite phases synthesized at high temperature, although particle aging produced more crystalline and less aggregated phases with higher bulk surface areas. Characterization of products by Al-27 NMR indicated only tetrahedrally coordinated Al. Measured isotropic shifts of primary resonances did not change substantially with precipitate aging although the primary mineral phase changed from zeolite X to sodalite/cancrinite, indicating local ordering of Al-Si tetrahedra. Analysis of reaction products by Sr EXAFS suggested Sr bonding in hexagonal prisms and six-membered rings of the supercages of zeolite X that may be more site specific than those of monovalent cations. For samples aged for 548 days, interatomic distances from Sr-EXAFS are consistent with partial Sr dehydration and bonding to framework oxygen atoms in socialite cages or in large channels in cancrinite. Incorporation of Sr into both faujasite and sodalite/cancrinite phases is favored over Cs during room-temperature synthesis, possibly because of increased cation site competition between Cs+ and Na+ Results of this study help to constrain cation incorporation into sodalite/canctinite mineral assemblages that form at caustic waste-impacted field sites and may aid in the predictive modeling of contaminant release.									11	0	0	0	5	0	11			0003-004X	1945-3027		WOS:000297241400015

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted considerable attention owing to their high catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. However, the high surface energy of the single atoms often results in an extremely low loading of metal atom catalysts with limited mass activity. In this context, densely populated SACs are more promising for practical applications due to their high active surface area and mass activity. Herein, the recent research progress of high loading (>= 5 wt%) SACs for different electrocatalytic applications is summarized. An overview of various synthesis and characterization strategies of SACs is presented in this review. The influence of appropriate substrates on the preparation of high metal loading SACs is also discussed. In addition, this review provides valuable insights into the current challenges and future opportunities in the field of single-atom catalysts.									107	6	0	0	3	0	107			2366-9608			WOS:000497208200001

We used reverse genetics and heterologous expression to identify the enzyme for Chl f synthesis. Null mutants of "super-rogue" psbA4 genes, divergent paralogs of psbA genes encoding the D1 core subunit of photosystem II, abolished Chl f synthesis in two cyanobacteria that grow in far-red light. Heterologous expression of the psbA4 gene, which we rename chlF, enables Chl f biosynthesis in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. Because the reaction requires light, Chl f synthase is probably a photo-oxidoreductase that employs catalytically useful Chl a molecules, tyrosine Y-Z, and plastoquinone (as does photosystem II) but lacks a Mn4Ca1O5 cluster. Introduction of Chl f biosynthesis into crop plants could expand their ability to use solar energy.									104	3	0	0	89	0	109			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000381867700028	27386923

We present a brief summary of the single degenerate scenario for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae in which it is assumed that a low mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf is growing in mass as a result of accretion from a secondary star in a close binary system. The growth in mass requires that more material remain on a white dwarf after a thermonuclear runaway than is ejected by the explosion. Recent hydrodynamic simulations of accretion of solar material onto white dwarfs without mixing always produce a thermonuclear runaway and "steady burning" does not occur. For a broad range in WD mass (0.4 M-circle dot to 1.35 M-circle dot), the maximum ejected material occurs for the 1.25M(circle dot) sequences and then decreases as the white dwarf mass decreases. Therefore, the white dwarfs are growing in mass as a consequence of the accretion of solar material, and as long as there is no mixing of accreted material with core material. In contrast, a thermonuclear runaway in the accreted hydrogen-rich layers on the low luminosity WDs in close binary systems where mixing of core matter with accreted material has occurred is the outburst mechanism for classical (CN), recurrent, and symbiotic novae. The differences in characteristics of these systems is likely the WD mass and mass accretion rate. The high levels of enrichment of CN ejecta in elements ranging from carbon to sulphur confirm that there is dredge-up of matter from the core of the WD and enable them to contribute to the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium. Therefore, studies of classical novae can lead to an improved understanding of Galactic nucleosynthesis, some sources of pre-solar grains, and the Extragalactic distance scale. The characteristics of the outburst depend on the white dwarf mass, luminosity, mass accretion rate, and the chemical composition of both the accreting material and WD material. The properties of the outburst also depends on when, how, and if the accreted layers are mixed with the WD core and the mixing mechanism is still unknown.									43	2	0	0	0	0	43			0304-9523			WOS:000314326200013

The results showed that the surface state of all the electrodes is controlled by the redox transition of Ir(III)/ Ir(IV). The voltammetric charge, the double-layer capacitance, and the electrochemical activity present similar variation with the composition of the oxide mixture, showing maximum values at 50-70% Ir. The high electrochemical activity of the electrode with 50-70% Ir is attributed to not only its good electrocatalytic effect but also its large electrochemically active surface area, especially the contribution of the inner surface.

A structure modification function of g-C3N4 for Al2O3 in the hydrothermal process is found, which can be attributed to the coordination between unoccupied orbitals of the Al ions and lone-pair electrons of the N atoms. The as-synthesized heterojunctions exhibit much higher photocatalytic activity than pure g-C3N4. The hydrogen generation rate and the reaction rate constant for the degradation of methyl orange over 50% g-C3N4/Al2O3 under visible-light irradiation (>420nm) are 2.5 and 7.3times, respectively, higher than those over pristine g-C3N4. The enhanced activity of the heterojunctions is attributed to their large specific surface areas, their close contact, and the high interfacial areas between the components as well as their excellent adsorption performance, and efficient charge transfer ability.									69	5	0	0	4	0	72			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000357026700027	26043440

However, poor product selectivity is still a major obstacle to the development of CO2 reduction. Here we demonstrate exclusive Ni-N-4 sites through a topochemical transformation strategy, bringing unprecedentedly high activity and selectivity for CO2 reduction. Topochemical transformation by carbon layer coating successfully ensures preservation of the Ni-N4 structure to a maximum extent and avoids the agglomeration of Ni atoms to particles, providing abundant active sites for the catalytic reaction. The Ni-N4 structure exhibits excellent activity for electrochemical reduction of CO2 with particularly high selectivity, achieving high faradaic efficiency over 90% for CO in the potential range from -0.5 to -0.9 V and gives a maximum faradaic efficiency of 99% at -0.81 V with a current density of 28.6 mA cm(-2). We anticipate exclusive catalytic sites will shed new light on the design									532	43	0	0	28	0	535			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000414115800018	28992701

This study was the first to realize ferroelectric properties in undoped HfO2 films by the chemical solution deposition method, which broke the above restrictions while using the ALD method. The evolution of ferroelectricity in pure HfO2 films was studied over a wide range of thickness from 34 nm to 136 nm, without doping any other metallic elements. The HfO2 film with a thickness of 136 nm exhibited a large remnant polarization (P-r) of 22.56 mu C cm(-2) after a wake-up process of 10(5) cycles, and could endure up to 10(7) switching cycles. Residual carbon from the incomplete decomposition of organic matter in films and growth disruption of grains through layer-by-layer thermal treatment could lead to the reduction in grain size, which was beneficial to the formation of the metastable ferroelectric o-phase. Oxygen vacancies existing at the interfaces between the TiN bottom electrode and HfO2 film could be rearranged during electric field cycling, thus inducing the appearance of ferroelectricity. The movement of domains under different tip bias by a piezo force microscope verified the existence of ferroelectricity in the undoped HfO2 films. This report therefore provides an inexpensive and feasible way to gain ferroelectricity in pure HfO2 films and paves the way toward other sensor applications beyond thickness limitations and doping systems.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000518640600021

In marine waters, biogeochemical conditions that lead to toxic levels of sulfide generally relate to factors that affect oxygen dynamics or the sediment iron concentration. In freshwaters, increases in surface water sulfate have been implicated in decline of Zizania palustris (wild rice), which is important in wetlands across the Great Lakes region of North America. We developed a structural equation (SE) model to elucidate key variables that govern the evolution of sulfide in pore waters in shallow aquatic habitats that are potentially capable of supporting wild rice. The conceptual basis for the model is the hypothesis that dissimilatory sulfate reduction is limited by the availability of both sulfate and total organic carbon (TOC) in the sediment. The conceptual model also assumes that pore water sulfide concentrations are constrained by the availability of pore water iron and that sediment iron supports the supply of dissolved iron to the pore water. A key result from the SE model is that variations in three external variables (sulfate, sediment TOC, and sediment iron) contribute nearly equally to the observed variations in pore water sulfide. As a result, management efforts to mitigate against the toxic effects of pore water sulfide on macrophytes such as wild rice should approach defining a protective sulfate threshold as an exercise tailored to the geochemistry of each site that quantitatively considers the effects of ambient concentrations of sediment Fe and TOC.Plain Language Summary Aquatic plants, such as wild rice, white rice, and waterlilies that have roots in the saturated soils of wetlands are vulnerable to the buildup of toxic levels of hydrogen sulfide (also called sulfide). Anaerobic bacteria in the soil make the sulfide from sulfate that penetrates the soil from the overlying water. When sulfate in the waterbody is low, sulfide in the soil is low. But when sulfate is high, sulfide has been hard to predictsometimes low, sometimes high. The analysis of hundreds of wetland samples finds that sulfide can be predicted if two variables in addition to sulfate are considered: organic carbon in the soil, which is the food for the bacteria, and iron in the soil, which removes sulfide from solution. A model of the chemical reactions finds that the three variables, sulfate, organic carbon, and iron, are equally important in determining sulfide. The sensitivity of individual waterbodies to sulfate pollution effects on wild rice toxicity can thus be predicted from the analysis of the carbon and iron concentrations in the soil of a wetland.									9	1	0	0	5	0	10			2169-8953	2169-8961		WOS:000418086800001

Here, the recent advances of 2D metal-free nanomaterials beyond graphene and its analogs toward a wide range of electrocatalysis applications are reviewed. The strategies for constructing advanced 2D metal-free nanomaterial-based electrocatalysts are discussed in terms of surface engineering and interface engineering.

The electronic properties of Ag3Pd/WC are studied and compared with other catalysts in detail to unveil the underlying physics. The oxidation of CO on Ag3Pd/WC (0001) prefers to proceed efficiently through the L-H mechanism. The bimetallic alloy overlayer supported on WC would open a new perspective in designing of high-performance catalysts with low content of noble metal and high resistance to CO poisoning.

To illustrate the use of XPS, some examples will be given on materials used as positive electrode in microbatteries.Further analyses of the film to understand the redox process are quite difficult with conventional methods due to the amorphous nature of the cathode. Here surface methods like XPS are very useful. Two main kinds of information can be obtained from XPS analysis: the oxidation states, and the determination of atomic environments.Different kinds of positive electrode materials were studied, titanium and molybdenum oxysulfides (MOySz, M = Ti, Mo) and lithium cobalt oxide (LixCoO2+y) and have been illustrated in the present work. In light of the binding energies obtained fbr the reference compounds, several types of environments and different formal oxidation states have been found for the transition elements.XPS is also very useful for following the oxydo-reduction mechanisms occurring during the intercalation and the de-intercalation of lithium, corresponding respectively to the discharge and the charge of the battery. After strict identification of each species, the evolution of their binding energies could be followed very easily. The XPS analyses of oxysulfides thin films at different stages of their cycling process have shown apparently good efficiency of the oxygen-rich compositions.During the redox process, the results obtained have clearly shown the important contribution of the sulfur atoms beside the transition metal atom.									27	0	0	0	1	0	34			0250-4707			WOS:000081316400064

Their high surface area-to-volume ratio facilitates their very high reactivities; therefore, they can be utilised in different ways in biomedical applications. For example, these nanoparticles can penetrate into cells and bind with proteins or DNA and are therefore potential nanostructures employed for sensing and detecting various biological identities. In the present work, we synthesised Au-NPs via a colloidal process using chloroauric acid (HAuCl4 center dot 4H(2)O) and trisodium citrate dihydrate (N3C6H5O7) as a reducing agent. The shape evolution and the structural properties of these NPs were investigated in detail using TEM and high resolution HR-TEM investigations. Different doses of Au NPs have been applied to treat C2C12 myoblast cells in a 24-h incubation period, and a dose-dependent study has also been performed. The cells were cultivated in DMEM with FBS and antibiotics (strepto-penicillin) at 37 degrees C in a 5% humidified environment of CO2 and 95% air. Cell viability analysis using mu assays revealed that increased concentration of Au NPs (100-1000 ng/mL) resulted in a decreased density of cells. The amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in C2C12 cells analysed with Au-NPs (in a dose-dependent manner), and the RT-PCR data demonstrated the up-regulation of caspase-3 and caspase-7 genes in C2C12 cells after treatment with Au-NPs. These results have been confirmed by detailed confocal microscopy (CLSM) studies. In addition, the quantitative analysis of the Au-NPs was also confirmed by statistical analytical parameters, such as precision, accuracy, linearity, limits of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ), quantitative recoveries and relative standard deviation (RSD), and the analyses again exhibited a significant and large effect of Au NPs on C2C12 cells.

The use of an oscillating bowl placed beneath the two magnetrons arranged in a co-planar closed field configuration enabled the deposition of bismuth tungstate onto loose powders, rather than a solid substrate. The atomic ratio of the bismuth/tungsten coatings was controlled by varying the power applied to each target. The effect of the bismuth tungstate coatings on the phase, optical and photocatalytic properties of titania was investigated by X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measurements, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and an acetone degradation test. The latter involved measurements of the rate of CO2 evolution under visible light irradiation of the photocatalysts, which indicated that the deposition of bismuth tungstate resulted in a significant enhancement of visible light activity, for both anatase and rutile titania particles. The best results were achieved for coatings with a bismuth to tungsten atomic ratio of 2:1. In addition, the mechanism by which the photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 nanoparticles was enhanced by compounding it with bismuth tungstate was studied by microwave cavity perturbation. The results of these tests confirmed that such enhancement of the photocatalytic properties is due to more efficient photogenerated charge carrier separation, as well as to the contribution of the intrinsic photocatalytic properties of Bi2WO6.

J	Zhang, Junfeng; Li, Xintian; Zhao, Haoyang; Pei, Yabiao; Zhu, Weikang; Yin, Yan								Synthesis of Co-based gas diffusion electrode for oxygen reduction								CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE				66	35			4592	4598		10.1360/TB-2021-0365				2021	2021	Because of the high cost and scarcity of Pt. the commercialization of fuel cell technology is still facing a great challenge. Compared with the proton exchange membrane fuel cell, one advantage of the anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) is the possibility of partially replacing or completely removing Pt catalyst in the cathode. Recently, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of transition metals (such as Fe, Co, Ni as well as their compounds) in alkaline environments has been greatly improved. with substantial efforts devoted to controlling the nanostructure and adjusting the active sites (including the density and chemical structure). Based on rotating disk electrode (RDE) tests, these transition metal compounds show attractive ORR performance as compared with state-of-art Pt/C catalysts. However, when fabricated into films for membrane electrode assembly, these highly active transition metal compounds (such as Co-based materials) do not show satisfactory fuel cell performance. hindering their further development for application in fuel cells. This is because of an insufficient understanding of structure-activity relationships of transition metal catalyst layers for fuel cells. Compared with conventional powder catalysts, nanostructured catalysts directly grown onto a conductive substrate, for example by electrodeposition, are anticipated to construct an electron conductive framework, optimizing the triple-phase-boundary within the catalyst layer. Furthermore, catalyst structures and their arrays can be easily and quickly obtained by the electrodeposition method.In this work, a catalyst layer composed of CoS/CoO nanosheets was grown in situ on a gas diffusion layer by electrodeposition. The morphology and elemental composition of the gas diffusion electrode were analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The ORR performance of the gas diffusion electrode was evaluated by half-cell, which can better reflect the actual fuel cell working condition compared with RDE analysis. The electrodeposition conditions (deposition cycles, dissolved oxygen) were studied to investigate their influence on the CoS/CoO nanosheets. The results show that the loading of the catalyst on the gas diffusion layer increases with the number of deposition cycles. thus resulting in a higher ORR activity. A gas diffusion electrode prepared in nitrogen atmosphere presents dense nanospheres with less mesoporous structure, showing lower electrochemical active area and poor ORR activity. By contrast, CFP@CoS50 presents nanospheres which consist of nanosheets. To further improve the performance of gas diffusion in the electrode. a post-heat treatment was conducted on CFP@CoS50 under different protective atmospheres and activation temperatures. The results indicate that with the increase of activation temperature under argon atmosphere, the morphology of the nanosheets gradually disappears, and the Co element aggregates to form >1 mu m particles. However, under the argon-hydrogen mixture (90% argon and 10% hydrogen), the agglomeration of the Co-based nanosheet can be effectively avoided. thus obtaining promising ORR performance. The results show that the CFP@CoS50-500-H-2 electrode has a predominantly four-electron ORR pathway for direct OH- formation. This work provides a facile electrodeposition method for preparing a transition metal-based electrode with controlled nanostructure, which may open a new avenue for the design of membrane electrode assemblies for next generation fuel cells.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0023-074X	2095-9419		WOS:000739334800012
