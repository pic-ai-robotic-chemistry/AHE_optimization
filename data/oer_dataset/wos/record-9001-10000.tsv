J	Kim, Myeongjin; Ju, Hyun; Kim, Jooheon								Highly efficient bifunctional catalytic activity of bismuth rhodium oxide pyrochlore through tuning the covalent character for rechargeable aqueous Na-air batteries								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				6	18			8523	8530		10.1039/c8ta01374h				MAY 14 2018	2018	Na-air batteries have received significant attention as possible candidates for alternative battery systems due to their high specific energy density (1683 W h kg(-1)). However, the undesirable sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) limit the practicality of the production of rechargeable Na-air batteries. Recently, pyrochlore oxides (A(2)B(2)O(7)) have received great attention as effective bifunctional electrocatalysts. However, the comprehensive understanding of catalytic activity with the development of new pyrochlore catalysts is unsatisfactory due to the limited use of B-site cations. Here, we report the use of a novel nanocrystalline bismuth rhodium oxide (Bi2Rh2O6.8) crystal with a pyrochlore structure as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. Moreover, the surface of Bi2Rh2O6.8 was modified via phosphate-ion functionalization (P-Bi2Rh2O6.8) to enhance its surface chemical reactivity, resulting in fast and efficient charge transfer with high ORR and OER activities. During electrocatalysis, the functionalized H2PO4- ion can not only significantly enhance the surface reactivity for a fast and efficient electron/charge-transfer reaction but also facilitate the oxidation of Bi and Rh ions and boost the electron donation by improving the electron transport. Finally, the first successful translation of the bifunctional electrocatalytic activities of P-Bi2Rh2O6.8 to a practical device, an aqueous Na-air battery, was demonstrated.									30	3	0	0	1	0	30			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000434624800043

In this work, using first-principle computations, we systematically investigated the catalytic activities of a variety of metal-N-C/MoS2 hetero-structures (M-N-C/MoS2, M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Os, Ir, and Pt) towards the oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). Our result revealed that these M-N-C/MoS2 heterostructures exhibit good structural stability, excellent electrical conductivity, and improved stiffness. Furthermore, the anchored Ir-N-C was identified as the best bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalyst due to its lowest overpotentials (0.28/0.38 V) among all candidates, which were well rationalized by its optimal binding strength with the oxygenated intermediates. Thus, by combining M-N-C and MoS2 monolayer, the highly-efficient bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts can be achieved, which offers a new strategy to further explore heterostructures-based materials for other electrochemical processes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000873642200001

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirm well-distributed NPs with sizes from 2 to 13 nm stabilized on the CTF particles. Metal contents between 10 and 41 wt% were determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). Nitrogen sorption measurements of the metal-loaded CTFs revealed Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas between 904 and 1353 m(2) g(-1). The composites show superior performance toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with low overpotentials from 47 to 325 mV and toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with high half-wave potentials between 810 and 872 mV. IrOx samples in particular show high performances toward HER while the Pd samples show better performance toward ORR. In both reactions, electrocatalysts can compete with the high performance of Pt/C. Exemplary cyclic voltammetry durability tests with 1000 cycles and subsequent TEM analyses show good long-term stability of the materials. The results demonstrate the promising synergistic effects of NP-decorated CTF materials, resulting in a high electrocatalytic activity and stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2296-2646			WOS:000838351400001	35958237

A series of hybrids of noble metal nanocrystals (NMNCs) and two-dimensional metal-organic framework (2D MOF) nanosheets are designed and synthesized by a facile, fast, and general approach, in which NMNC dispersion is quickly mixed with MOF precursors at room temperature. The NMNCs/2D MOF hybrids, denoted as M-Ni-NS (M = Ir, Ru or Pt, etc.), are assembled by taking advantage of abundant O-atom arrays on the surface the of 2D MOF nanosheets and they enable excellent dispersity and stability. Experimental and computational results show that the M-O-Ni bridging bonds realize successful tuning of the electronic structure of active sites and modify their activity. Taken together with the merits of the nanostructure of the 2D MOF support, this multiscale optimization strategy produces Ir-Ni-NS electrocatalysts with excellent performance for the oxygen evolution reaction, achieving a low overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media and long time stability.									12	3	0	0	0	0	13			2196-7350			WOS:000609283900001

In this study, we fulfill an OER improvement by introducing of trace Au on CoFe2O4 surface by electrochemical method. The loading of trace Au highly improves the OER activity, decreasing the overpotential of 374 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) to 312 mV and showing a small Tafel slope of 35 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH. The loaded trace Au largely increases the electrochemical active specific area. The electronic interactions between Au and the adjacent CoFe2O4 modulate the electron structure of metal sites, which further optimize the binding strength between the involved intermediates and catalysts, facilitating the transform of rate-limiting step. Importantly, such enhanced electrocatalytic performance can be largely maintained after a long-time stability test.									27	2	0	0	1	0	28			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000461150400024

This is especially the case for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is largely challenged by the cost-ineffectiveness of the best performing electrocatalysts (i.e., Ru, Ir), along with their limited stability under acidic conditions. This presents a roadblock in the development of robust acid-based polymer exchange membrane electrochemical systems, currently the most advanced technologies for electrochemical energy conversion. Approaches such as dilution of Ru/Ir into flexible mixed metal oxide frameworks have been used as alternative strategies in designing robust OER electrocatalysts. Herein, we discuss the state of research in this area and detail the effect of the composition and structure of mixed metal oxides on their acidic OER activity and stability. Future directions for developing mixed metal oxide electrocatalysts suitable for acidic electrochemical environments are devised. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, the energy conversion efficiency of water splitting process is fundamentally dependent on the catalytic activity of selected electrocatalyst. In particular, one of the main reasons that hinder the practical application of water splitting system is the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Hence, earth-abundant elements-based catalysts with excellent OER catalytic performance is significantly important. Herein, MOF-derived NiCo2S4/Fe2O3 hybrid nanostructure grown on carbon cloth (NiCo2S4/Fe2O3@CC) was successfully fabricated as OER catalyst. Benefiting from the merits of unique architecture with hybrid heterostructure grown on carbon cloth, high porosity and abundant active sites, the designed NiCo2S4/Fe2O3@CC demonstrated superior electrocatalytic performance toward the OER. The fabricatedNiCo(2)S(4)/Fe2O3@CC catalyst exhibited very low overpotential of 190 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 45 mV dec(-1). Further-more, the as-fabricated catalyst demostrated remarkable stability. The present work provides an effective method to fabricate novel metal sulfide and metal oxide hybrids for OER catalysis.

Herein, we report mesoporous ultrathin cobalt oxides nanosheets (similar to 7 nm) grown on carbon cloth (denoted as CoOx/CC) as an efficient electrode for water oxidation. The electrode was fabricated via a simple calcination of cobalt alkoxyacetate grown on carbon cloth under air atmosphere. The as-synthesized CoOx/CC electrode exhibited better electrocatalytic performance for OER in 1.0 M KOH, with lower overpotential of similar to 263 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), lower Tafel slope of 56.07 mV dec(-1), and better stability, in comparison with commercial IrO2 and Co3O4 nanoparticles. Also, the OER performance of CoOx/CC-10 is among the best of the reported cobalt oxides electrocatalysts. Detailed characterizations reveal that the interaction between cobalt oxides and CC, unique 3D structures, ultrathin nature of nanosheets, high specific surface area, nanoporous structures, and fast electron transfer rate contributed to the enhanced catalytic activity. More importantly, the synthetic strategy applied here has great potential application in large-scale production of efficient electrodes in water splitting technology.									16	1	0	0	0	0	17			2574-0962			WOS:000462944700045

The characterization on microstructures suggest that Fe/Ni ratio significantly affects the morphology and phase composition of Fe-Ni-O-x architectures. The Fe-rich samples exhibit spindle-like structures while the Ni-rich samples consist of irregular nanoparticle aggregates, and the higher Ni ratio is favorable for the formation of Fe-Ni-spinel strucutre in product. Serving as nonprecious electrocatalysts, the Fe-Ni-O-x architectures exhibit the remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium, which is found to be closely dependent on composition of Fe-Ni-O-x catalysts. The active phase of spinel-structured NiFe2O4 plays a dominating role in enhancing the electrocatalytic OER activity of the Fe-Ni-O-x architectures. Based on the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy analysis, the possible OER mechanism of the Fe-Ni-O-x architectures is unraveled as well. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the exploration of efficient OER electrocatalysts has become a significant topic in the research of advanced energy materials. Transition metal compounds exhibit great potential as highly active OER electrocatalysts, and rational regulations have been applied to boost their OER performance. Among these strategies, anion regulation is an emerging but effective method to improve the OER activity of transition metal compounds. In this review, recent advances in anion-regulated multi-anion transition metal compounds as OER catalysts are introduced, including the synthesis methods, the regulation of anions and their effects on OER activity. Anion regulation during OER tests, i.e. surface oxidation of the catalysts, is also discussed in this review. Then, studies are introduced according to the type of regulated anion. This review is expected to provide further insight into the composition and structure regulation of OER catalysts and inspire further research into transition metal-based energy materials.									81	13	0	0	3	0	83			2052-1553			WOS:000428186400001

This work explored the impact of W precursor concentration (0 similar to 10 mM) on LDH morphologies and performance in hydrogen production. Using an electrodeposition W-doping process, W-induced NiFe LDHs (NiFeW-LDHs) were in-situ grown on carbon fiber papers for water splitting. A performance peak was found at a W doping of 5 mM with well-aligned nanosheets, which not only boosted the charge transfer ability and gas evolution but also offered more than a four-fold electrochemical surface area increase compared to film-like NiFe hydroxides. The NiFeW-LDHs exhibited remarkable performance compared to NiFe hydroxides, showing decreased overpotentials of 31 mV and 114 mV for the oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) at 10 mA/cm(2) and -10 mA/cm(2), respectively, in alkaline media. The performance enhancement at 5 mM W-doping was linked to the well-aligned NiFeW-LDH nanosheets; smaller, less-textured nanosheets were observed with lower or higher W precursor concentrations (2.5 mM or >7.5 mM), leading to inferior OER and HER performances. Hence, an appropriate W doping is crucial to generating the morphologies that contribute to the higher performance of NiFeW-LDHs. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Well-defined colloidal nanocrystals with tunable monodisperse size and uniform shapes are ideal platforms to investigate the effect of these parameters on the catalytic performance. In addition to translating the knowledge from single-crystal studies to more realistic conditions, the morphological and compositional complexity attainable by colloidal chemistry can provide access to active catalysts which cannot be produced by other synthetic approaches. The sample uniformity is also beneficial to investigate catalyst reconstruction processes via both ex situ and operando techniques. Finally, colloidal nanocrystals are obtained as inks, a feature which facilitates their integration on different substrates and cell configurations to study the impact of interactions at the mesoscale and the device-dependent reaction microenvironment on the catalytic outcome. In this Review, we discuss recent studies in selected electrochemical reactions and provide our outlook on future developments on the use of well-defined colloidal nanocrystals as an emerging class of electrocatalysts.									29	1	0	0	2	0	28			2155-5435			WOS:000618540300020

Correspondingly, spin state transitions from spin singlet OH-/H2O reactants to spin triplet O-2 product have not yet received enough attention. In view of this, this article will discuss electron behaviours during OER by taking into consideration of spin attribute. The main conclusion is that, regardless of the possible adopted mechanisms (the adsorbate evolution mechanism or the lattice oxygen mechanism), the underlying rationale of OER is that three in four electrons being extracted from adsorbates should be in the same spin direction before O=O formation, superimposing high requirements on the spin structure of electrocatalysts. Therefore, upon fully understanding of the OER mechanism with considerations of spin, the awareness of the coupling between spin, charge, orbital and lattice parameters is necessary in the optimization of geometric and electronic structures in transition metal systems. Based on this, this article will discuss the possible dependency of OER efficiency on the electrocatalyst spin configuration, and the relevance of well-recognized factors with spin, including the crystal field, coordination, oxidation, bonding, the e(g) electron number, conductivity and magnetism. It is hoped that this article will clarify the underlying physics of OER to provide rational guidance for more effective design of energy conversion electrocatalysts.

The optimization of the composition, interfacial structure and conductivity of the electrocatalyst is conducted to achieve bifunctional catalytic activity and deliver outstanding efficiency and stability for both ORR and OER.

Here a cobalt (Co)-based hierarchical porous material (HP-Co), which is realized through a scalable phase-separation approach, is reported. Taking the advantage of a unique trimodal structure with macropores, mesopores, and micropores, the HP-Co electrocatalysts exhibit better OER performance than general Co-based nanoporous electrocatalysts due to more effective use of active sites. Meanwhile, this phase-separation approach can be extended to prepare various hierarchically nanoporous electrocatalysts via facile doping with heteroatoms including Fe and Ni, to fine-tune their surface properties and intrinsic activities.									6	1	0	0	1	0	7			2196-7350			WOS:000486211300018

Hollow multimetallic nanostructures with well-defined facets are ideally suited for saving the usage of expensive precious metals as well as boosting catalytic performances; however, Ir-based hollow nanocatalysts have rarely been reported. Here, a very simple synthetic scheme is reported for the preparation of hollow octahedral nanocages of Co-doped IrCu alloy with readily tunable morphology and size. The Co-doped IrCu octahedral nanocages show excellent electrocatalytic activity and long-term durability for OER in acidic media. Notably, their OER activity represents one of the best performances among Ir-based acidic OER catalysts.									143	6	1	0	4	0	146			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000394681900004

It is shown that the Ir NP, although oxidized after synthesis and drying, can be electrochemically reduced allowing determination of the electrochemically active surface area by CO stripping. Subsequently, an activation protocol is applied forming catalytically active Ir-oxide NP. This oxide formation is shown to be largely irreversible. It is then demonstrated that the activated Ir NP synthesized via our recently introduced colloidal method exhibit extremely high OER activities when normalized to their Ir mass. These high OER activities are related to superior dispersion as compared to state-of-the-art OER catalysts reported in the literature.									37	0	0	0	1	0	37			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000496465000011

In this work, for the first time, we demonstrate that the OER activity of beta-FeOOH is enhanced via V-doping and the generation of both iron and oxygen vacancies. The novel V-doped, divacancy-containing beta-FeOOH is obtained in-situ through a pre-OER cyclic voltammetry activation of hydrated layered Fe5V15O39(OH)(9)center dot 9H(2)O Various analyses reveal that the vanadium dissolution in basic electrolyte accounts for the in-situ formation of V-doping and divacancy beta-FeOOH. The experiment shows that V-doping regulates the formation of oxygen vacancies, subsequently resulting in the modulation of Fe oxidation state and charge transfer characteristics. Metallic Fe in the beta-FeOOH also contributes to the enhanced charge transfer. Density functional theory calculation reveals that V-doping and iron vacancy balance the adsorption and desorption of oxygen intermediate species, giving a reduced energy barrier of the rate determining step during OER. As a result, the V-doped, divacancy-containing beta-FeOOH exhibits an excellent OER overpotential of 232 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), high current density > 450 mA cm(-2), no potential decay after 2,000 cycles, and 72 h stability, outperforming the benchmark RuO2 and the other Fe-based catalysts. A water splitting cell consisting of the beta-FeOOH anode F(V)OOH and a Pt/C cathode demonstrates an excellent cell voltage of 1.51 V at 10 mA cm(-2). This facile method to obtain metal doping and divacancy simultaneously leads to a new approach for further development of electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000779708000003

Herein, an advanced Co3O4 electrocatalyst supported on a mesoporous hydrophobic carbon paper (Co/29BC) is formed via a simple one-step thermal decomposition of cobalt nitrate. Through this novel approach, the amorphous carbon layer resulting from the thermal decomposition of carbon-containing species in the mesoporous layer provides enhanced electronic conduction and protection against corrosion to the Co3O4 nanoparticles. Equally important, the OER performance is found to be correlated with the morphology and surface composition of Co3O4. With optimized Co3+ active sites and oxygen vacancies at the metal oxide surface, the Co3O4 catalyst shows superior OER performance and durability in a proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer, with a small overpotential (350mV) at a constant current density of 10mAcm(-1) for over 50h. Accordingly, this work provides new insights toward the design of high-performance and highly stable OER electrocatalysts in corrosive acidic environments.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2699-9412			WOS:000783863100014

We herein use a two-step electrodeposition method to prepare a series of nanofilm electrodes containing Ni, Co, P, and Se on carbon cloth. After a suitable electrochemical activation process through cyclic voltammetry, the resultant binder-free NiCoP-NiCoSe2 nano-bilayer films are transformed from compact layer(s) to porous nanoparticle ones composed by NiCo hydroxides and a small amount of NiCo oxyhydroxides and thus exhibit a striking electrocatalytic activity (lower to 243 mV overpotential for 10 mA cm(-2)) and excellent stability (80 h) for OER. The rougher surface, well-suited electronic structure originated from the Ni/Co codoping and the rational integration of NiCoP and NiCoSe2 are important factors for the excellent OER performance of the NiCoP-NiCoSe2 film after the electrochemical activation process. In addition, the results on overall water splitting reveal that the NiCoP-NiCoSe2 film is also promising in the practical application of energy conversion and storage.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			2168-0485			WOS:000509432200055

Herein, we rationally designed a novel route, involving hydrothermal electrodeposition of Ni/Zn alloy and in situ electrochemical dealloying followed by sulfuration, to fabricate three-dimensional mesoporous nickel sulfide nanosheets assembled tightly on Ni foam for oxygen evolution reaction. The mesoporous Ni3S2 nanosheets/Ni foam exhibited a highly mesoporous structure with a specific surface area of 60.1 m(2) g(-1) and showed a low overpotential of 223 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 60.5 mV dec(-1); this overpotential is superior to that of IrO2/Ni foam. As-prepared Ni3S2 nanosheets/Ni foam achieved a high turnover frequency value of 0.61 mol O-2 s(-1) at an overpotential of 500 mV. Impressively, the as-obtained catalyst possessed excellent conductivity and outstanding stability for over 240 h. The superior catalytic property could be ascribed to the rational synthetic process, morphology-controlled mesoporous structure, and highly exposed active sites. This paper presents an efficient route to fabricate porous nanosheets as stable and efficient electrocatalyst for water oxidation.									43	6	0	0	2	0	46			2168-0485			WOS:000460600500094

Both pathways are believed to share a common, elusive intermediate, namely, the hydroperoxyl radical. By exploiting a cobalt single-atom biomimetic model catalyst, based on a self-assembled monolayer of Co-porphyrins grown on an almost free-standing graphene sheet, we identify, in situ at room temperature in O2+H2O atmosphere, a hydroperoxyl-water cluster that is stabilized at the Co single-metal atom catalytic site. We show that the interplay between charge transfer, dipole and H-bonding, and water solvation behavior actually determines the hydroperoxyl-water complex stability, the Co-OOH bonding geometry, and, prospectively, opens to the engineered control of the selectivity of ORR pathways.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000819449600001

The conventional routes to synthesize such nanostructures rely on the use of hard/soft sacrificial templates or on high reaction temperatures. Herein, we report a template-free method to rapidly transform nonhollow MnO NCs into hollow nanostructures at room temperature. Our synthesis method is based on the reaction of guest metal cations M delta+ (e.g., Fe2+, Ce3+, Fe3+, etc.) with MnO NCs, the latter being actually passivated by a thin Mn 3 0 4 layer. The guest cations replace part of the Mn ions in the Mn3O4 shell up to a critical threshold value (e.g., similar to 12 at. % when working with Fe2+ guest cations), above which etching of the MnO core rapidly occurs. Our analyses suggested that the etching of the core could be related to the release of strain that is built up between the MnO core and the Mn3-xMxO4 shell as the exchange progresses. When Fe2+ ions are employed as guest cations, the resulting Mn3-xMxO4 hollow NCs exhibit high activity in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction due to their large electrochemical surface area and low charge transfer resistance. Our work provides an easy and green synthesis strategy to prepare hollow NCs with control over the composition and size, which are features that make them efficient electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2574-0970		WOS:000668366800032

MoS2 has been considered as a promising low-cost catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), however its activity is limited by poor conductivity and low abundance of active sites. Moreover, its suitability as an effective catalyst for other reactions, in particular the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), was hardly explored to date. Herein, we show hybrid nanostructures of shelled CuS particles with MoS2 layers, which produces several outcomes: The MoS2 shell is strained and defective, and charge transfer from the core to MoS2 occurs, enabling activation of the basal plane of MoS2. Changing the feed ratio of the precursors led to control over morphology, such that the wrapping of the cores with the shell was continuously varied and characterized. We found an optimal hybrid structure, which provided high electrochemical active surface area and fast charge transfer kinetics, leading to improved activity not only towards HER (overpotential of 225 mV at 10 mA cm-2), but also for the sluggish ORR (onset potential 0.87 V vs RHE).									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000664246000004

Pure stoichiometric NiO is inevitably an insulator, which hampers the electron transfer and transport in catalysis. While non-stoichiometric NiOx is a wide bandgap p-type semiconductor. The conductive interface of nonstoichiometric NiOx NCs is successfully fabricated, which the p-type conductivity of NiOx originates from two positive charge compensation which favored Ni2+ vacancies. The valence band (VB) of NiOx is well adjustable so that the strong electron interaction induces electronic structure modulation, which optimizes the binding energy of *OOH intermediates. In the alkaline water splitting, non-stoichiometric NiOx NCs exhibit remarkable performance toward OER with an overpotential of 330 mV (1.56 V vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm?2 and a Tafel slope of 105.17 mV dec?1, as well as an extraordinary robust stability. Detailed investigations show that the high density of defects combine with oxygen atoms to form NiOOH species, which are conducive to the OER kinetics. This work offers valuable generalized insights for constructing robust non-stoichiometric metal oxides electrocatalysts and encouraging for large-scale practical applications.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000636226600002

In this work, we report a handy electrodeposition technique to incorporate CoP on a three-dimensional (3D) CuO microflower to construct a hierarchically structured anode (denoted as CuO-FR@CoP) for efficient oxygen evolution reaction. Resulting from the large quantity electroactive sites provided by the hierarchically interconnected 3D configuration and the intense electronic interactions between CuO core and CoP shell, the anode shows superior activity and stability in alkaline environment with a low Tafel slope (56 mV dec(-1)); the overpotentials are only 290 and 330 mV respectively to drive the 50 and 300 mA cm(-2) current densities. The bulk electrolysis shows that the CuO-FR@CoP material is capable of maintaining a stable current density of 56 mA cm(-2) for at least 30 h, giving rise to a high Faraday efficiency of 98%. The catalytic performance of CuO-FR@CoP electrode outperforms the majority of the electrocatalysts based on Cu materials reported so far. Moreover, this work provides a significant method for the fabrication of other catalysts.									38	1	0	0	1	0	38			2168-0485			WOS:000443924100022

It was shown that the anodic current peak that appeared in iron-free electrolyte at a less positive potential than the potential of the oxygen evolution probably coincides with oxidation of hydrogen in >CH2 groups and C-sp(2) graphite impurities with formation of >C=O groups in a C-sp(3) diamond structure. Addition of Fe(III) compounds to the electrolyte provoked the formation of an anodic wave on the cyclic voltammograms in the potential region that correlates with the generation of ferrate(VI). It is concluded that the direct electrochemical synthesis of Fe(VI) at a boron-doped diamond anode is possible because of the less positive potential of ferrate(VI), FeO42-, formation with respect to the potential of the oxygen evolution reaction. The presence of fen-ate(VI) in the electrolyte, formed after anodic polarization of the boron electrode in 10 M KOH electrolyte saturated with Fe(III) at 0.9 V against Hg/HgO electrode, was proven by UV-Vis spectrometry.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			0352-5139			WOS:000315607000011

Up to now, the role played by the functional metal species in OER/ORR is still insufficiently understood. The main focus of our research is to shed light on the mechanistic role of the Co species that serve as active sites in the bi-functional Co-NCNT catalysts. It is found that 5700 exhibits an outstanding OER/ORR activity. We thus hypothesize that Co-II and Co-III clusters predominately function as active sites in the OER and ORR processes, respectively. Furthermore, OER/ORR activity for Co-NCNT catalyst primarily correlates to e(g) occupation.

A conjugated polymer PEDOT is a metal-free material for which promising ORR experimental results have been obtained. However, sound theoretical understanding of this reaction at an organic electrode is insufficient, as the concepts inherited from electrocatalysis at transition metals are not necessarily relevant for a molecular organic material. In this work, we critically analyze the basics of electrochemical ORR and build a model for our DFT calculations of the reaction thermodynamics based on this analysis. Altogether, this work leads to a conclusion that outer sphere electron transfer that currently attracts increasing attention in the context of ORR is a viable mechanism at a conducting polymer electrode.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000549942500040

Herein, we report a facile and economical route for synthesizing ultrasmall molybdenum phosphide (MoPy) nanocrystal-attached mesoporous manganese phosphides on N,P-codoped graphene nanosheets, which display equivalent ORR (OER) activity to that of Pt/C (RuO2) catalysts. This is manifested by the positive onset potential (0.969 V) and half-wave potential (0.842 V) for ORR, as well as a mere overpotential of 301 mV at a current density of 20 mA-cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 105 mV.dec(-1) for OER in alkaline medium. It also demonstrates remarkable stability in comparison with Pt/C and RuO2 for both ORR and OER, respectively. The excellent performance can be attributed to the mesoporous structure with enhanced multiple types of electroactive sites, which highly favors the adsorption and catalyzation of reactants, as well as efficient reagent/product mass transport. The findings can pave a new way for the synthesis and usage of a hybrid as a bifunctional catalyst with high efficiency and outstanding longevity to enable next generation of energy conversion and storage.									49	0	0	0	2	0	49			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000466053300024

Herein we report the impact of graphitic carbon nitride concentration (0.03 similar to 0.1 g) on nickel-cobalt sulfide morphologies and performance in hydrogen production. Employing the facile hydrothermal method, a cubic crystalline nickel-cobalt sulfide was stabilized on defective layered graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets for overall water splitting. A performance peak was observed in a sample with a graphitic carbon nitride concentration of 50 mg, which not only prevented the agglomeration but also provided a porous structure for enhanced gas diffusivity and charge transfer rates owing to the synergistic Carbon and Nitrogen bonding with Cobalt and Nickel Sulfide. Optimized concentration of graphitic carbon nitride also increased the electrocatalytic active surface area threefold when compared with nickel-cobalt sulfide. The fabricated well-aligned flower-like pattern CoNi2S4/graphitic carbon nitride (50 mg) delivered a low overpotential of 310 mV and 160 mV for oxygen evolution reactions and hydrogen evolution reactions to reach a current density of 30 mA/cm(2) and 10 mA/cm(2) in alkaline media. The electrolyzer displayed an electrolysis potential of 1.58 V to reach 10 mA/cm(2) current density with the long-term durability of 24 h. This strategy depicts a novel approach for utilizing this renowned nickel-cobalt sulfide with graphitic carbon nitride catalyst for the application of alkaline electrocatalytic water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000831515300003

Creation of oxygen vacancies of manganese-based oxides with the aim to enhance their intrinsic activities is rarely reported, and there is a critical requirement for a mild and facile synthesis strategy to create abundant oxygen vacancies on manganese-based oxides. Herein, Co-doped MnO2 nanowires were reduced by NaBH4 solution at room temperature; then, MnCo2O4.5 nanosheets with abundant oxygen vacancies and active sites were formed on the surface of Co-doped MnO2 nanowires. Benefiting from the reduction strategy, the fabricated hierarchical Co-doped-MnO2@MnCo2O4.5 nanowire/nanosheet nanocomposites exhibit higher catalytic activity (an overpotential of 250 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution) than pristine Co-doped MnO2 nanowires. The calculated TOF of Co-doped-MnO2@MnCo2O4.5 is 0.034 s(-1) at the overpotential of 300 mV, which is 136-fold higher than that of Co-doped-MnO2. The excellent OER performance was attributed to the synergistic advantages of abundant oxygen vacancies and active sites over the hierarchical nanowire-nanosheet architectures.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000661975000001	34132721

We report a new strategy of fabricating conducting polymer-derived nanostructured materials to accelerate the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and water splitting. Extended physical (XRD, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX)) and electrochemical (cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)) methods were merged to precisely characterize the as-synthesized iridium and ruthenium modified polyaniline (PANI) materials and interrogate their efficiency. The presence of Ir(+III) cations during polymerization leads to the formation of Ir metal nanoparticles, while Ru(+III) induces the formation of RuO2 oxide nanoparticles by thermal treatment; they are therefore methods for the on-demand production of oxide or metal nanostructured electrocatalysts. The findings from using 0.5 M H2SO4 highlight an ultrafast electrochemical kinetic of the material PANI-Ir for HER (36 - 0 = 36 mV overpotential to reach 10 mA cm(-2) at 21 mV dec(-1)), and of PANI-Ru for OER (1.47 - 1.23 = 240 mV overpotential to reach 10 mA cm(-2) at 47 mV dec(-1)), resulting in an efficient water splitting exactly at its thermoneutral cell voltage of 1.45 V, and satisfactory durability (96 h).									11	0	0	0	1	0	11				2073-4360		WOS:000612051100001	33430248

Herein, a folic acid based metal-organic gels (MOG) is synthesized based on co-ordination induced self-assemble strategy, which affords well-defined dispersion cobalt implanted into N-doped porous carbon (CoNC-MOG-x) via pyrolysis. The as-obtained CoNC-MOG-x possesses well distributed Co-nanoparticles and larger accessible surface areas than the CoNC without self-assemble process. Taking advantage of the unique structure, the CoNC-MOG-9 exhibits good oxygen reduction reaction activity, and the half-wave potentials for oxygen reduction reaction is 0.815 V. In addition, it also displays high oxygen evolution reaction activity with overpotential of 0.40 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 76 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, integrated CoNC-MOG-9 cathode in an all-solid-state zinc-air battery exhibits a high specific power of 63 mW cm(-2) as well as excellent stability and durability.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000582798700034

Herein, a novel 3D ethoxy substituted FeNi oxalate (ENWs-FeNi-C2O4) nanowires network catalyst with hydrophilic channels is reported firstly, which shows an outstanding OER activity with a low overpotential (215 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and small Tafel slope (54.5 mV dec(-1)). OER catalytic mechanism indicates that the OH adsorption step and O-2 bubble diffusion step of OER reaction process can be significantly improved due to the special hydrophilic channels, and the ethoxy as an interlayer ligand not only expands the interlayer distance of layered FeNi (oxy) hydroxide true active species but modulates its electronic structure, promoting the *OOH formation step, and thus exhibiting the outstanding OER performance.

We demonstrate that the chloride corrosion can transform commercial Ni-Fe alloy (invar) into an electrode, revealing a high-efficiency oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The corroded electrode consisted of a dense vertical array of NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets on the invar foil surface. We discovered that the corrosion rate difference between metallic components of the binary metal serves the growth of the NiFe LDH at the invar surface. This NiFe LDH electrode required an overpotential of 211 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) in 1 M KOH, outperforming the commercial IrO2 catalyst by 47 mV. This electrode showed excellent activity against OER owing to their high intrinsic electrical conductivity of direct growth and high electrochemical surface area of NiFe LDH nanosheets. Furthermore, this electrode exhibited excellent electrochemical stability without decay in performance for 7 days at the current density of 50 mA/cm(2).

Herein, Cu-based metal-organic framework (MOP) is directly supported on conductive Cu foam (CF) by a simply chemical oxidation of Cu substrate to grow Cu(OH)(2) nanowire arrays, followed by solvothermal treatment to obtain in situ grown Cu-based MOF electrode (MOF [Cu(OH)(2)]/CF). The as-prepared 3D electrode shows superior OER activity with a low potential of 330 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 108 mV dec(-1), and excellent durability in alkaline media (1.0 M KOH).

Here, a three-dimensional rods array catalysts of Ni3S2 doped with trace amount of Fe on foam FeNi3 (Fe-Ni3S2@FeNi3) are synthesized. It is found experimentally that Fe-Ni3S2@ FeNi3 has excellent catalytic activity and corrosion resistance in both acidic, neutral and alkaline solutions. In 1.0 M KOH solution, only small overpotentials of 105 mV and 213 mV are required to achieve the current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER respectively. In addition, Fe-Ni3S2@FeNi3-8 also exhibits excellent catalytic activity in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution (eta(10) = 48 mV) and 1.0 M PBS solution (eta(10) = 83 mV) for HER. In 1.0 M KOH and 0.33 M urea solution, Fe-Ni3S2@FeNi3-8 requires only 1.40 V to provide the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for urea oxidation reaction (UOR). As evidenced, doping Fe element into catalyst can significantly increase the catalytic activities for HER and OER.

Here, FeCo-bimetallic polyphthalocyanine (FeCo-PPc) with ultra-low-cost of less than $0.1 per gram and excellent OER electrocatalytic performance has been prepared in kilogram-scale for the first time. The FeCo-PPc catalyst, around 1/5000th times lower the cost of the commercial IrO2, exhibits 24 times higher turnover frequency (0.417 s-1 at 300 mV) and much lower the overpotential (308 mV at 500 mA cm-2) than that of IrO2 (0.0177 s-1 and 588 mV, respectively). Moreover, the FeCo-PPc catalyst shows outstanding long-term stability under an industrial condition (6 M KOH and 85celcius) at the high current densities of 100 mA cm-2 and 500 mA cm-2. The excellent OER activity can be attributed to the electron interaction between Fe and Co and the electronegativity of N atoms, which regulate the electron cloud density of neighboring atoms and form active sites to promote the adsorption of reactants. Our work may guide rational design and large-scale synthesis of electrocatalysts that work well at high current densities in industrial conditions.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000701949000001

Firstly, uniform Co-3(CH3COO)(5)(OH) cubes are prepared by microwave method. Then as-prepared Co-3(CH3COO)(5)(OH) cubes as precursors have been conducted by phosphorization at low temperature. Novel CoP hollow prisms with 1 mu m length, 500 nm width and 500 nm height have been synthesized. The obtained CoP hollow prisms can be used as both an efficient electrocatalyst for HER in acid media (0.5 M H2SO4 solution) and a remarkable bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water-splitting in alkaline media (1.0 M KOH solution) which might be attributed to their high surface area, porosity and good distribution. The OER mechanisms of CoP in alkaline solution have been investigated through XPS and SEM Mapping, which demonstrate that the amorphous oxygen-containing nanostructure on the surface of CoP may be the real catalytic active species. In addition, phosphidation of uniform cobalt salt hydrates precursor with specific structure at low temperature is a newfangled and effective strategy to synthesis bifunctional electrocatalyst CoP.

In this study, hierarchical NiO microflake@NiFe-layer double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheet core shell arrays on nickel foam were fabricated by combining a two-step hydrothermal synthesis and a calcination process. Due to the three-dimensional rational configuration, the obtained composite electrode showed high performance for OER, which needed a low apparent over potential of 265 mV to afford a 10 mA cm(-2) current density. In addition, the NiO@NiFe-LDH coated electrode was further treated in an organic solution via ultrasound for in situ intercalation of the NiFe-LDH to provide wide channels for ion transportation and gas diffusion. As a result, the charge transition resistance was obviously reduced and the apparent activity as well as the long-term stability was improved. The optimized NiO@NiFe-LDH composite exhibited an excellent long-term stability in 50 h even at high current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm(-2), and meanwhile the required apparent overpotential of OER for sustaining 10 mA cm(-2) current density was reduced from 265 to 210 mV.									53	3	0	0	1	0	53			2168-0485			WOS:000456631800055

The intensive laser pulses delivered to materials within nanoseconds allow the formation of novel structures that are inaccessible for conventional methods. Layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanostructures with high porosity, suitable dopants, and rich defects are desirable for catalysts, however, tremendously difficult in a one-pot synthesis. Here it is found that confined laser shock in solvent leads to the formation of nanoreactors which guide the assembly of multiscale LDH building units, larger nanosheets as frame and smaller nanodomains as building blocks. These nanodomains have rich vacancy defects and are interlocked in a high packed density of 10(13) cm(-2), leaving rich mesopores across the nanosheets and coral-like morphology. Like the natural coral reef that has multiscale structure to accommodate different marine organisms, the coral-like LDH metastructure provides large surface area and rich active sites for the interaction with guest molecules. Benefiting from the multiscale porous structure and rational dopant, this LDH catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 220 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), standing as one of the best LDH catalysts to date.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000837043900001	35934817

With the downsizing from nanoparticles and clusters to single atoms, there are steady changes in the bond and coordination environment for each and every atom involved. Indeed, the single atoms in these electrocatalysts are not "singles"; they are "married" to the supporting surfaces, and their performance is controlled by the bonding and coordination with the substrate surfaces. Herein, an overview is presented on the brief history leading to the rapid development of SACs and their current status, by focusing on their synthesis, control of composition, strategies to realize single atoms with the desired bonds and coordination, and targeted performance in selected reactions. Their applications in the selected spectrum of energy conversion and chemical reactions are discussed, in relation to their structures at varying length scales down to the atomic level. A particular emphasis is placed on on-going research activities, together with the future perspectives and particular challenges for SACs.									89	5	0	0	2	0	88			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000509825200001

We present a thin-film composite electrode with a unique morphology and an ultralow loading of iridium that has extraordinary electrocatalytic properties. This is accomplished by the electrochemical growth of a defined, high-surface-area titanium oxide nanotubular film, followed by the nitridation and effective immobilization of iridium nanoparticles. The applicative relevance of this production process is justified by a high oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) activity and high stability. Enhanced OER performance is due to the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI). The high durability is achieved by self-passivation of the titanium oxynitride (TiON) surface layer with TiO2, which in addition also effectively embeds the Ir nanoparticles while still keeping them electrically wired. An additional contribution to the enhanced durability comes from the nitrogen atoms, which according to our density functional theory (DFT) calculations reduce the tendency of the Ir nanoparticles to grow. Materials are analyzed by advanced electrochemical characterization techniques. Namely, the entire process of the TiON-Ir electrode's preparation and the electrochemical evaluation can be tracked with scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) at identical locations. In general, the experimental approach allows for the unique morphological, structural, and compositional insights into the preparation and electrocatalytic performance of thin films, making it useful also outside electrocatalysis applications.									24	1	0	0	2	0	24			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900053

Currently, there are many catalysts for water splitting. Cerium (Ce) can be a catalyst itself and it also can be a catalyst promoter due to its flexible coordination and excellent redox ability. Here we try to introduce Ce into FeCoP catalyst, which has been proved to a promising electrocatalyst toward water splitting. The ternary CeFeCoP was prepared by hydrothermal on nickel foam (NF). Then low temperature phosphating is followed. The CeFeCoP/NF shows an efficient electrocatalytic performance. The CeFeCoP/NF electrocatalyst requires overpotential of 298 mV at current density of 50 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), much lower than 323 mV of FeCoP/NF; and it demands an ultralow overpotential of 97 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with respect to 194 mV of FeCoP/NF. Moreover, it presents quite smaller Tafel slopes of 114 mV dec(-1) (OER) and 147 mV dec(-1) (HER) compared to 153 mV dec(-1) (OER) and 159 mV dec(-1) (HER) for FeCoP/NF. When CeFeCoP/NF is used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting, a cell voltage of just 1.55 V can be achieved at 10 mA cm(-2), which is much lower than 1.67 V of FeCoP/NF electrolyzer. Furthermore, the stability of CeFeCoP/NF electrolyzer can maintain 90% after 10 h of chronoamperometry test, displaying an excellent durability. This outstanding performance of CeFeCoP/NF can be attributed to larger electrochemical specific area, easier charge transfer process, and facilitated Ce3thorn.

A possible OER mechanism is attributed to some groups that support the surface active site of the catalyst and adsorbent intermediate species. Finally, this inexpensive electrocatalyst was synthesized without noble metals and showed superior electrocatalytic activity and great stability with the potential to achieve ground-breaking and novel applications in fuel cells.									19	0	0	0	3	0	19			1948-7185			WOS:000670642600012	34152758

However, the low catalytic activity in the OER limits its practical application. This paper deals with the preparation of perovskite oxides (by the sol-gel method) with enhanced electrocatalytic activity through selective dissolution of A-site cations of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (LSCF) in order to tune the A-site cation deficiency. Additionally, a thorough investigation of the catalysts' OER performance was performed in a 0.1 mol.L-1 KOH solution. Based on the results of XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS and ICP-AES, it can be concluded that selective dissolution of Sr cations on A-sites can be achieved using a HNO3 etching remaining the perovskite structure. The OER catalytic activity of LSCF can be effectively promoted after acid etching for 6 h, which can be attributed to the higher surface area (BET result) and ratio of the high oxidative oxygen species (O-2(-)/O-) and surface oxygen species (OH-/O-2). Moreover, the LSCF catalysts maintains an appropriate electrochemical stability after acid etching. Our work offers a simple but effective way to modify the perovskite surface so as to boost the OER performance.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000564736000008

Herein, a trifunctional electrocatalyst featuring CoP socketed on an oxygen deficient layered perovskite is synthesized through an in situ exsolution and an intriguing "post-growth" approach. As revealed by experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) simulation, the simultaneous introduction of CoP and oxygen vacancies modifies the electronic configuration of the catalysts and the reactants adsorbed on their surface. The intimate interpenetration of these two components yields synergistically active sites, which results in excellent performances towards the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The CoP-PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+delta (CoP-PBSCF) electrode demonstrates a high power density (138.0 mW cm(-2)), a competitive charge/discharge polarization, and a superior stability to commercial Pt/Ru/C in Zn-air batteries. Moreover, it shows a low overpotential (0.440 V) in overall water splitting, surpassing most reported electrocatalysts. The proposed protocol offers an attractive strategy for designing perovskite-based electrocatalysts for versatile devices.									60	5	0	0	1	0	60			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000501213600043

Thus to greatly improve the functions of the materials, herein, we developed an effective strategy to construct the lattice strain and high-energy interfaces by fabricating bunched MOF-derived CeOx/CoS along long CeO2 nanorods (L-CeO(2)NRs), which can be used as efficient OER electrocatalysts. Our design principle involves the formation of lattice strain between the units through the epitaxial compression growth of MOF-derived hollow CoS nanocages along CeO2 NRs and the further generation of high-energy interfaces through interactions between each two CeOx/CoS polyhedrons with highly active heterostructure, lattice defects and grain boundaries. This study afforded a novel approach to tune the lattice strain and interface-catalysis engineering, thus unlocking the hidden potential of MOF-derived materials for effective catalytic applications.									36	3	0	0	3	0	36			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000464414200028

Herein, well-aligned mesoporous CoFe2O4 thin film is first developed from surface epitaxial growth of oriented CoFe-based Prussian blue analogue thin film (CoFe-PBA thin film) for efficient electrocatalytic OER. CoFe-PBA thin film with preferred [100] orientation is first prepared on the substrate surface by employing liquid phase epitaxial method without any structure-directing surfactants. After thermal pyrolysis, such CoFe-PBA thin film was transformed into well-aligned mesoporous CoFe2O4 thin film. Interestingly, the self-support CoFe3O4 thin film electrode with the mass loading of 1.6 mg cm-2 delivers an oxygen evolution current density of 10 mA cm-2 at an overpotential of 266 mV and exhibits durable stability in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. The remarkable and stable catalytic performance of the CoFe2O4 thin film can be mainly owing to the mesoporous structure of CoFe2O4, efficient charge/electron transfer, the numerous exposed active sites, and the well-structured configuration of the electrode. Hence, this work provides an effective paradigm for preparing binder-free, self-support, and low-cost spinel oxide electrocatalyst for efficient OER derived from surface epitaxial growth of oriented PBA thin film.									96	8	0	0	6	0	98			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000467661700001

Splitting water through a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer is a well-known method of hydrogen production. But the major impediment is the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Currently, scientists are struggling to build out an acid-stable electrocatalyst for OER with low overpotential and excellent stability. In this review, the reaction mechanism and characterization parameters of OER are introduced, and then the improvement method of metal nanocatalysts (noble metal catalysts and noble metal-free catalysts) in acidic media is discussed. Particularly, the application of single-atom catalysts in acidic OER is summarized, which is current researching focus. At the same time, we also briefly introduced the cluster phenomenon, which is easy to occur in the preparation of single-atom catalysts. More importantly, we summarized the in situ characterization methods such as in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and so forth, which are conducive to further understanding of OER reaction intermediates and active sites. Finally, we put forward some opinions on the development of acidic OER.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8				2692-4560		WOS:000692129300008

EIS spectra were recorded as a function of the overpotential for the OER. Impedance spectra characterized by two time constants distributed in the low and high frequency domains indicated that both the charge transfer and adsorption of reaction intermediates affect the electrode kinetics. In addition, it was verified that morphological aspects do not comprise the main cause for the time constant observed in the high frequency domain. In trying to interpret the EIS findings, a transfer function was derived for the electrode mechanism of Pavlov and Monahov in order to permit the evaluation of the adsorption pseudocapacitance, the double-layer capacitance and the charge transfer and adsorption resistances. It was verified that the adsorption pseudocapacitance is potential-dependent while the double-layer capacitance is almost potential-independent. It was also verified that the adsorption resistance decreases exponentially upon increasing the overpotential, exhibiting Tafel-like behavior. The apparent charge transfer coefficient, the exchange current density and the kinetic rate constant were evaluated from the impedance data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, self-supported Ni-Fe-Sn electro-catalysts were fabricated on nickel foam (NF) through a simple and facile pulse electro-deposition process. Under optimal conditions, the prepared Ni-Fe-Sn electrocatalysts exhibited excellent bifunctional properties in alkaline medium and required ultralow overpotentials of only 27 and 201 mV for HER and OER, respectively, to reach the current density of 10 mA cm-2. Importantly, the same Ni-Fe-Sn electrocatalyst can be assem-bled as the anode and the cathode in a two-electrode system. It demanded a fairly low applied voltage of 1.55, 1.72, and 1.87 V to produce 10, 50, and 100 mA cm-2, respectively, and exhibited excellent long-term stability.

Catalytic performance in these materials depends on their chemical composition and the presence of nanostructures. These novel hierarchical nanostructures contain small secondary nanosheets that are grown on the primary nanowire arrays, providing a higher surface area and more efficient mass transport for electrochemical reactions. The activities of the NiyM(OH) x HNAs for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) followed the order of Ni2.2Fe(OH)(x) > Ni(OH)(2) > Ni2.1Zn(OH)(x), and these trends are supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The Fe-doped nickel hydroxide hierarchical nanoarrays (Ni2.2Fe(OH)(x) HNAs), which had an appropriate elemental composition and hierarchical nanostructures, achieve the lowest onset overpotential of 234 mV and the smallest Tafel slope of 64.3 mV dec(-1). The specific activity, which is normalized to the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of the catalyst, of the Ni2.2Fe(OH)(x) HNAs is 1.15 mA cm(BET)(-2) at an overpotential of 350 mV. This is similar to 4-times higher than that of Ni(OH)(2). These values are also superior to those of a commercial IrOx electrocatalyst.									109	0	0	0	11	1	109			2045-2322			WOS:000398583700001	28383065

However, the electrocatalytic activity of most recently reported materials is limited by the large onset potential, poor electrical conductivity and low density of catalytic centers. In this study, we report facile deposition of palladium oxide nanoparticles onto cobalt oxide nanostructures (PdONPs@Co3O4) through the illumination of ultraviolet (UV) light. The fabricated PdONPs@Co3O4 nanocomposites offer high density of active sites, improved electrical conductivity and durability for OER activity. The synergetic effect between the Co and Pd ions at the interface of composite system might change the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates, thus enabled the reaction to proceed at lower energy consumption. Significantly, the prepared PdONPs@Co3O4 samples demonstrated a low overpotential of 250 mV at a current density of 20 mA/cm(2), with low charge transfer resistant of 48.5 Uand high durability for more than 40 h during OER processes. The combined results suggest that incorporating of a low amount of PdONPs can tune the surface properties of Co3O4 and interfacial chemistry. This could led to accelerate the charge transport properties at the interface during a specific electrochemical application. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we report a direct and up-scalable all-solid-phase strategy for the synthesis of a porous three-dimensional electrode consisting of cobalt nanoparticles wrapped in nitrogen-doped carbon tubes (Co/N-CNTs), which are in situ planted onto the surface of a cobalt foam. The resultant Co/N-CNTs can directly serve as a self-supporting and adhesive-free electrode with excellent and durable catalytic performances for the ORR, OER and HER. The metal framework substrate with an open-pore architecture is favorable for electron and mass transfer and allows fast catalytic kinetics. More importantly, when used in Zn-air batteries and overall water splitting, the as-prepared Co/N-CNT electrode displays a remarkable performance, implying bright perspects for practical application.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000674048700001	34477615

The open-circuit potential evolution of cobalt is similar to that of nickel, due to the similarity of oxidation stages.

NiO-based nanostructures supported on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were synthesized by atomic layer deposition (ALD) using NiCp2 and O-3 as precursors. NiO-coated CNTs display enhanced catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction. The recorded overpotential of 315 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in Ar-saturated 1 M KOH is lower than any reported values so far for NiO-based catalysts. Moreover, the overpotential is constant for 12 h electrolysis at current density of 10 mA cm(-2), highlighting the stability of our materials. The Tafel slopes of 50 mV dec(-1) are also lower than other Ni-based nanostructures previously reported. The study of CVs in the redox region in Fe(III)-free and Fe(III)-saturated 1 M KOH solutions proves that the high catalytic activity is intrinsic of the NiO/carbon composite and is not influenced by iron precipitation. The enhanced catalytic activities could be attributed to the conformal and well-distributed NiO layer by ALD and the large surface area and good conductivity of the CNTs network.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			2574-0962			WOS:000458706500019

Numerous approaches to the viability of bifunctional perovskite electrocatalyst represent that the electrochemical performance is highly correlated with defect chemistry, surface structure, and overall polycrystalline perovskite structure. By making use of the intrinsic flexibility of internal structure and high nonstoichiometry in perovskite oxide, the heat treatment effect of the complex Ba0.5Sr0.5CoxFe1-xO3- (x = 0.2 and 0.8) perovskites in argon atmosphere at 950 degrees C (Ar-BSCF5582 and Ar-BSCF5528) on the surface structure/defect chemistry and electrocatalytic performance is intensively investigated. Upon heat-treatment in argon atmosphere, the amorphous thickness layer increases from approximate to 20 to 180-200 nm in BSCF5582, while there is little change in BSCF5528 with approximate to 20 nm. The electrocatalytic performance of BSCF5582 catalyst both in ORR and OER deteriorates seriously, while Ar-BSCF5528 demonstrates a significant increase of electrochemical performance in ORR. This study demonstrates that the electrochemical performances of a perovskite catalyst can be significantly determined by the simultaneous modification of both surface structure and internal defect chemistry, which are explained with transmission electron microscopy and atomic-selective X-ray absorption fine structure analyses, respectively.									53	0	0	0	2	0	53			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000367218400015

Conventional strategies for vacancy engineering, however, have a strong focus on non-metal sulfur/oxygen defects, which have often overlooked metallic vacancies. Herein, evidence is provided that cobalt vacancies can be atomically tuned to have different sizes to achieve cobalt vacancy clusters through controlling the migration of iridium single atoms. The coalescence of Co vacancy clusters at the surface of an IrCo alloy results in an increased d-band level and eventually compromises H adsorption, leading to enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction. In addition, the Co vacancy clusters can improve the electronic conductivity with respect to the oxidized Co surface, which substantially aids in strengthening the adsorption of oxygen intermediates toward an effective oxygen evolution reaction at a low overpotential. These collective effects originate from the Co vacancy cluster and specifically enable highly efficient and stable water splitting with a low total overpotential of 384 mV in alkaline media and 365 mV in an acidic environment, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2).									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000641595700001

Correspondingly, several aspects of the intrinsic catalytic activity, for example, the role of center-metal-atoms, number and type of metal-coordinated atoms, and the surrounding environment of central-metal-atom, are systematically discussed. This review includes two major parts: i) the rational summary of recently reported catalysts, comprising synthesis/identification approaches of active sites to catalytic performance, and ii) the basic key factors, influencing the performance. Equal emphasis is given to experimental results and theoretical calculations to figure out the structure-function correlation between the active-sites configuration and the intrinsic electrocatalytic performance. A research paradigm is suggested to design advanced single-metal-atom catalysts for fuel cells and metal-air batteries. Regardless of these developments, we highlight some remaining debatable issues that require urgent attention.

Currently, it is important to explore non-precious metal electrocatalysts with high electroactivity and stability in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for the development of Zn-air batteries. In this work, porous (Ni,Co)Se-2 nanosheets were synthesized by selenizing NiCo2O4 nanosheets. By regulating the conductivity and morphology of the sample, the prepared porous (Ni,Co)Se-2 nanosheets show enhanced electrocatalytic activity for OER and ORR compared to NiCo2O4 nanosheets. The aqueous Zn-air battery using porous (Ni,Co)Se 2 nanosheets as the air cathode exhibits superior charge and discharge performance (1.98 V for charging and 1.17 V for discharging), high specific capacity (770 mAh/g), and excellent cycle stability (140 h). These results indicate that the porous (Ni,Co)Se-2 nanosheets are suitable as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for future Zn-air batteries.

In this paper, homogeneous FeCoNiCu medium entropy alloys (MEAs) with a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure are prepared by the electrochemical reduction of oxides in molten Na2CO3-K2CO3 using a low-cost Ni10Cu11Fe oxygen-evolution inert anode. The current efficiency reaches 85.3% with a low energy consumption of 2.9 kWh/kg-MEA. At the cathode, Ni acts as a solvent to dissolve other elements and facilitate the formation of the FCC phase, and the co-reduction process enhances the element diffusion rate thereby ensuring the homogeneity of the electrolytic MEAs. In addition, the electrolytic MEAs are pressed into pellet electrodes with an in situ formed oxides layer to catalyze oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in 1.0 M KOH solution. The electrocatalytic activity of the electrolytic MEAs outperforms the commercial IrO2/Ta2O5-Ti electrode, i.e., the overpotential of the electrode is 439 mV at 50 mA/cm(2) and the electrode lasts for 10 h without any degradation. Therefore, this paper provides a facile approach to preparing homogeneous MEAs at below 1173 K using oxides feedstock, to accurately controlling compositions and structures of MEAs, and thereby to tailoring functionalities of MEAs.

Herein, we develop an effective strategy to couple physically distinct metal-rich nickel phosphide (Ni12P5) with mildly oxidized multiwall carbon nanotubes (O-MWCNTs) to boost the efficiency of OER. Ni12P5-O-MWCNTs outperforms O-2 evolution activity in contrast to the parental materials, Ni12P5 and O-MWCNTs. Intriguingly, Ni12P5-O-MVVCNTs shows an overpotential of 280 mV achieved at a current density of 10 mAcm(-2). The hybrid, Ni12P5-O-MWCNTs demonstrates remarkable OER activity by the virtue of development of heterointerfaces in which the effective interaction between Ni12P5 and O-MWCNTs plays a crucial role. Moreover, we have analyzed the XPS and HR-TEM of Ni12P5-O-MWCNTs after the chronoamperometry study of OER to examine the structural changes due to the prolonged oxidation reaction. This post OER study enabled us to identify the precatalyst and the active functional groups present in O-MWCNTs. Our approach opens a path for fabricating hybrid catalytic systems with synergetic activity to facilitate optimized electrocatalytic activity.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10				2574-0970		WOS:000595546500039

When the Li-O-2 cells were tested at the current density of 50 mA g(-1), the discharge capacities of the oxygen cathode with different La1-xSrxMnO3 (x=0, 0.2, 0.6) catalysts were 3573, 4408, and 5624 mA h g(-1), respectively. Additionally, the cell employed La0.4Sr0.6MnO3 as catalyst can be cycled at a limited capacity of 200 mA h g(-1) for about 71cycles, which is much higher than the 42 cycles for LaMnO3 electrode.

The various factor, including precursors, reaction time and power of sonication can affect the shape, size, and purity of the samples. We utilized X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to characterize the BaMnO3 nanostructures. The optical property of BaMnO3 nanostructures was explored by Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) and the energy gap was suitable for catalytic activity (about 2.75 eV). Changing the precursor can affect the size, nanoparticle shape, architectures, and uniformity of the samples. We employed the BaMnO3 nanostructures for O-2 evolution reaction as catalysts. It can observe that increasing the homogeneity of the catalysts can increase the efficiency of the Oxygen evolution reaction. The maximum amount of the O-2 evolution and the highest TOF and TON are related to nanoplate disc using barium salicylate as a precursor of barium. As a result, we can nominate the BaMnO3 nanostructures as an effective and novel catalyst for water-splitting reaction.									30	0	0	0	4	0	30			1350-4177	1873-2828		WOS:000504778900019	31669839

Herein Bi6Fe2Ti3O18-BiOBr (BFTO/BOB) heterostructure with intimate 2D/2D interfaces are successfully grown by converting part of ferroelectric BFTO nanosheets to BOB via an ion-exchange chemical reaction. For the first time, it is discovered that the conversion of BFTO to BOB is a self-limiting process, i.e., the reaction auto-stops at a certain ratio of BFTO/BOB even high concentration of reactants (hydrobromic acid) are used. This phenomenon is ascribed to the precipitation-dissolution equilibrium due to the higher solubility product constant of BiOBr. The fine 2D/2D structure of ferroelectric BFTO/BOB with good energy band alignment leads to two times and seven times higher oxygen evolution rates than non-ferroelectric BFTO/BOB and pure BFTO under full-spectrum irradiation, respectively. The promoted separation and transfer of photogenerated electron-hole pairs at the interface is clarified by the soft X-ray absorption spectroscopies, Mott-Schottky curves and photocurrent tests. What's more, the ferroelectric spontaneous polarization at the interface between the ferroelectric BFTO and the BiOBr also shows a synergetic effect for the oxygen evolution enhancement. Our finds may open up new windows to prepare 2D/2D heterostructures with improved photocatalytic activities.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000464931800018

Herein, a one-step strategy is adopted to synthesize 3D hybrid of CoSe nanoparticles encapsulated nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes graft onto nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (denoted as CoSe@NCNT/NCN) with excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in acidic and alkaline solutions, respectively. Benefiting from the unique morphology, the large surface area and good conductivity, the hybrid exhibits excellent electrocatalytic HER activity in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, which is a low overpotential of 197 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 43 mV dec(-1) . Meanwhile, it presents a low overpotential of 301 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 75 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution for OER. The good electrocatalytic property is comparable to most of the previously reported Co-based electrocatalysts and the synthetic method is low toxic and simple, which may be expanded to other transition metal dichalcogenides. The strategy provides a possibility for preparation for effective nonprecious high performance HER and/or OER electrocatalysts. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, novel materials comprising Mn/Cu nanoclusters-grafted N-doped carbon nanotubes are synthesized by preparing and then pyrolyzing Mn/Cu polyphthalocyanine-encapsulated carbon nanotubes (CNTs), followed by treating the products with acidic solution. The materials are named CNTs@(Mn,Cu)PPc-T, where T denotes the pyrolysis temperature in degrees C, and they are demonstrated to serve as efficient oxygen electrode catalysts for zinc-air batteries (ZABs). Among them, the one synthesized at 900 degrees C, CNTs@(Mn,Cu)PPc-900, requires more positive onset and half-wave potentials for reduction of oxygen and a low overpotential for the evolution of oxygen. A rechargeable ZAB assembled with CNTs@(Mn,Cu)PPc-900 electrocatalyst delivers a high power density (158.5 mW cm(-2)) and displays an excellent stability in 200 cycles of charge/discharge (in over 33 h). Such performance is even superior to that of a ZAB containing the benchmark Pt/C + RuO2 catalyst as an air cathode under identical testing condition. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Here, we report a highly active and stable La0.5Sr0.5Ni0.4Fe0.6O3-delta perovskite electrocatalyst for OER in alkaline media. La(0.5)Sr(0.5)NixFe(1-x)O(3-delta) (LSNF) perovskites with different Ni/Fe ratio were synthesized by a typical sol-gel route and investigated as potential cobalt-free OER perovskite electrocatalysts. Synchrotron XRD quantification analysis was applied to quantify the crystal structural details and changes. La0.5Sr0.5Ni0.4Fe0.6O3-delta (LSNF-5546) materials show significantly higher intrinsic activities and better stability in 0.1 M KOH for the OER including onset potential (1.56 V) and Tafel slope (76 mV/dec), higher than that of other LSNF and state-of-the-art perovskite electrocatalyst Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF-5582). This work demonstrates that La0.5Sr0.5Ni0.4Fe0.6O3-delta (LSNF-5546) can be a new kind of cost-effective and high-performance perovskite electrocatalyst for OER in alkaline solution, and the simple doping strategy would be a practical way to enhance oxygen evolution on perovskite electrocatalysts.

However, the generated oxygen bubbles in the electrodes are confined in the complex 3D structure, diminishing the catalytic activities and mechanical stability of the electrodes. Therefore, it is essential to rationally design an electrocatalytically active 3D electrode with an optimal microstructure to efficiently remove generated bubbles. Here, we report the fabrication of copper oxide nanoparticles embedded in nonoxidized graphene aerogels (CuONP-NOGAs). The microstructure of CuONP-NOGAs is finely tuned by optimizing the processing parameters of bidirectional freeze casting and its influence on bubble removal behavior efficiency is elucidated. Among electrodes with different degrees of alignment and pore densities, the vertically aligned NOGA with dense porosity exhibits the best efficiency by forming direct open paths for facile bubble movements. The high electrical conductivity combined with a low transfer resistance and uniformly dispersed active particles in CuONP-NOGAs offers excellent OER activities. They deliver a remarkable potential of 1.39 V at 10 mA/cm(2), which is lower than those of the state-of-the-art RuO2 and other copper oxide-based catalysts, as well as ultralong stability of more than 120 h, proving the significance of the effective design of the 3D catalyst microstructure. The present study may provide insights into the design of new 3D microstructures useful for practical application in next-generation energy conversion devices.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2168-0485			WOS:000683000400030

Herein, we put forward a strategy for boosting catalytic performances of a single Cu atom coordinated with three N atoms (CuN3) for both ORR and OER by increasing the density of connected CuN3 moieties. Our calculations first show that a single CuN3 moiety exhibiting no catalytic performance for ORR and OER can be activated by increasing the density of metal centers, which weakens the binding affinity to *OH due to the lowered d-band center of the metal atoms. These findings stimulate the further theoretical design of a two-dimensional compound of C3N3Cu with a high concentration of homogeneously distributed CuN3 moieties serving as bifunctional active sites, which demonstrates efficient catalytic performance for both ORR and OER as reflected by the overpotentials of 0.71 and 0.43 V, respectively. This work opens a new avenue for designing effective single-atom catalysts with potential applications as energy storage and conversion devices possessing high density of metal centers independent of the doping strategy and defect engineering, which deserves experimental investigation in the future.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-1343			WOS:000820948600001	35722000

Herein, we design and construct a Fe1Sx@Co3S4 electrocatalyst with Fe single atoms epitaxially confined in Co3S4 nanosheets for catalyzing the sluggish alkaline oxygen evolution reaction(OER). Consequently, in ultralow concentration alkaline solutions(0.1 mol/L KOH), such a catalyst is highly active and robust for OER with low overpotentials of 300 and 333 mV at current densities of 10 and 30 mA/cm(2), respectively, accompanying long-term stability without significant degradation even for 350 h. In addition, Fe1Sx@Co3S4 shows a turnover frequency(TOF) value of 0.18 s(-1), nearly three times that of Co3S4(0.07 s(-1)), suggesting the higher atomic utilization of Fe single atoms. Mossbauer and in-situ Raman spectra confirm that the OER activity of Fe1Sx@Co3S4 origins from a thin catalytic layer of Co(Fe)OOH that interacts with trace-level Fe species in the electrolyte, creating dynamically stable active sites. Combined with experimental characterizations, it suggests that the most active S-coordinated dual-metal site configurations are 2S-bridged (Fe-Co)S-4, in which Co-S and Fe-S moieties are shared with two S atoms, which can strongly regulate the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates, accelerating the OER reaction kinetics.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1005-9040	2210-3171		WOS:000854851200002

In this work, we show that the modification of the microstructure and the chemical properties of a mixed copper-cobalt oxide anode may contribute to increase the activity of this reaction. For this purpose, the OER has been systematically studied, either in a half cell or in a membrane electrode assembly configuration, as a function of the load and agglomeration degree of the catalysts used as electrodes, as prepared on a carbon paper support by magnetron sputtering deposition in an oblique angle configuration. Chemical analysis by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis by cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy have shown that cobalt-copper mixed oxide catalysts with a 1.8 Co/Cu atomic ratio and about one micron equivalent thickness maximizes the cell performance. The chemical, structural and microstructural factors controlling the final behaviour of these anodes and accounting for this maximization of the reaction yield are discussed on the basis of these characterization results and as a function of preparation variables of the electrodes and operating conditions of the cell.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000607096900005

Here we demonstrate the improvement of catalytic activity when transition metal oxide (iron, cobalt, nickel oxides and their mixed oxides) nanoparticles (similar to 20 nm) are electrochemically transformed into ultra-small diameter (2-5 nm) nanoparticles through lithium-induced conversion reactions. Different from most traditional chemical syntheses, this method maintains excellent electrical interconnection among nanoparticles and results in large surface areas and many catalytically active sites. We demonstrate that lithium-induced ultra-small NiFeOx nanoparticles are active bifunctional catalysts exhibiting high activity and stability for overall water splitting in base. We achieve 10mAcm(-2) water-splitting current at only 1.51V for over 200 h without degradation in a two-electrode configuration and 1M KOH, better than the combination of iridium and platinum as benchmark catalysts.									664	27	1	0	38	0	669			2041-1723			WOS:000357170100002	26099250

In this work, we present a constrained DFT (CDFT) approach to alleviate overdelocalization effects in the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This method is applied a posteriori to configurations sampled along a reaction path to correct their relative stabilities. Concretely, the first step of this approach involves describing the reaction in terms of a set of diabatic states that are constructed by imposing suitable density constraints on the system. Refined reaction energy profiles are then recovered by performing a configuration interaction (CDFT-CI) calculation within the basis spanned by the diabatic states. After a careful validation of the proposed method, we examined HER catalysis on open-ended carbon nanotubes and discovered that CDFT-CI increased activation energies and decreased reaction energies relative to DFT predictions. We believe that a similar approach could also be adopted to treat overdelocalization effects in other electrocatalytic proton-coupled electron transfer reactions, e.g., in the oxygen reduction reaction.

The architectures showed large electrochemically active surface area (29.67 m(2) g(-1)) and enhanced catalytic performances for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) both in acid and alkaline media.

The X Ray diffraction patterns presented a proportional increase in the cell volume and crystal lattice distortion according to the increment of the Zr4+ species concentration in the reactant mixture. The morphological characterization showed a decrease in particle size average as a result of the zirconium presence due to crystal distortion. The photocatalytic performance was evaluated in the hydrogen evolution reaction in the presence of methanol. In this context, the K2Ti5ZrO13 solid solution exhibited the highest performance (72 mu molg(-1) h(-1)) due to the higher presence of defects such as oxygen vacancies because of the Zr incorporation into the crystalline structure. In this context, these anionic defects can act as electron traps in bulk material and reduce recombination of charges; meanwhile, oxygen vacancies in surface create reactive Ti3+ ions, where the reactions of interest take place.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1010-6030	1873-2666		WOS:000623636800002

In this study, chromium deposition and poisoning at the La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-sigma (LSCF) anode or the oxygen electrode of SOECs are studied for the first time under a current density of 200 mA cm-2 at 900 and 800 degC. After polarization in the presence of the Fe-Cr interconnect at 900 degC for 20 h, electrode polarization resistance and overpotential of the O2 evolution reaction (OER) on the LSCF electrode are 0.413 cm-2 and 127 mV, respectively, which is nearly 7 and 18 times the initial values of the electrode before the polarization. Significant performance degradation was also observed for the reaction at 800 degC in the presence of the Fe-Cr alloy. XRD and XPS analyses clearly identified the deposition of SrCrO4, CrO2.5 and Cr2O3 phases on the surface of LSCF oxygen electrodes and their formation is closely related to the increased segregation of the SrO species under anodic polarization conditions. Sr segregation leads to Sr deficiency at the A-site, thus deteriorating the electrocatalytic activity of the LSCF oxygen electrodes for OER. The results indicate that Cr deposition is essentially a chemical reaction and is initiated by the nucleation reaction between the gaseous Cr species and segregated SrO on the surface region of the LSCF oxygen electrode.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076			INSPEC:15991385

Herein, a novel quasi-parallel NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) nanosheet arrays with pattern alignment on Ni foam was developed. The initial alpha-Ni(OH)(2) layer induced effective coprecipitation between Ni2+ and Fe3+ for the formation of LDH phase, guaranteeing the electronic pulling effect among metal cations and enhancing the interaction between active materials and substrate for excellent adhesion and electrical conductivity. Quasi-parallel NiFe LDH nanoarrays exhibited outstanding oxygen evolution activity with a small Tafel slope of 30.1 mV dec(-1) and overpotentials of 196, 255, and 284 mV at a current density of 10, 500, and 1000 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 m KOH solution, respectively, and high stability over 40 h at 750 mA cm(-2).

Water-Splitting Electrocatalysts Synthesized Using Ionic Liquids								TRENDS IN CHEMISTRY				1	2	SI		247	258		10.1016/j.trechm.2019.03.003				MAY 2019	2019	Electrocatalytic water splitting is a promising sustainable route for generation of clean-burning hydrogen. To realize this goal, more effective catalysts for the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions are required. In this review, we investigate the recent use of ionic liquids (ILs) in the synthesis of electro-catalysts for the water-splitting reactions. ILs have an attractive range of properties (e.g., high boiling points, wide electrochemical windows, and high vapor pressures) that facilitate the synthesis of materials that would be hard (or impossible) to obtain using other solvents. The number of reports using ILs for electrocatalyst synthesis has increased significantly in recent years. Therefore, the time is ripe for a critical review of current progress and outstanding challenges in this dynamic field.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9				2589-5974		WOS:000521129600013

Herein, the cuprous oxide (Cu2O) with three different morphology (facet) is successfully synthesized to reveal the correlated relationship between oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and electronic structure, where the Cu2O cube enclosed by high electronic density facet (100) exhibits enhanced OER performance. Then, CuO samples with different surface oxidation degree are obtained for further investigating the structure-function relationship. Finally, the CuO Cube(3h) with Cu vacancy (V-Cu-CuO Cube(3h)) contains more electroactive species and shows high catalytic performance with an onset overpotential of 252 mV and a Tafel slope of 63.4 mV dec(-1), respectively. It only needs 330 mV overpotential to drive 10 mA cm(-2) current density and maintains its catalytic property for at least 48 h. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that the exist of VCu has a positive effect on neighboring atoms to generate new electronic states near the Fermi level at the intermediate-absorbed structure, which also optimizes the absorption energy of oxygen intermediates, leading to faster charge transport to participate in the OER. This work provides a guidance for improving the OER performance by accurately regulating the surface charge distribution of the catalyst. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Herein, we prepared unique oxygen vacancy-rich core/shell NiO@Co3O4 nanocomposites decorated with Co3O4 nanosheets as efficient OER electrocatalysts. First, NiO@Co3O4 nanocomposites were synthesized through a rationally designed stepwise coprecipitation process followed by controlled heating treatment. With a facile NaBH4 reduction treatment, Co3O4 nanosheets were in situ formed on the surface of NiO@Co3O4 nanocomposites, introducing more oxygen vacancies and edge sites simultaneously. These surface-restructured core/shell NiO@Co3O4 nanocomposites exhibited significantly improved activity as OER electrocatalysts possessing a low overpotential (290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and a small Tafel slope (68 mV dec(-1)) in 1 M KOH media. Our work offers an effective strategy to prepare core/shell metal oxide nanocomposites with adjustable surface structures for electrocatalysis.									14	2	0	0	2	0	14			0888-5885			WOS:000486360700033

Developing cost-effective electrocatalysts for water electrolysis is thus of great research interest. Among various material candidates, transition metal phosphides (TMP) have emerged as robust bifunctional electrocatalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their various phases and tunable electronic structure. Recently, heterostructured catalysts have exhibited significantly enhanced activities toward HER/OER. The enhancement can be attributed to the increased amount of accessible active sites, accelerated mass/charge transfer, and optimized adsorption of intermediates, which arise from the synergistic effects of the heterostructure. Herein, a comprehensive overview of the recent progress of bifunctional TMP-based heterostructure is introduced to provide an insight into their preparation and corresponding reaction mechanisms. It starts with summarizing general fundamental aspects of HER/OER and the synergistic effect of heterostructures for enhanced catalytic activity. Next, the innovational strategies to design and construct bifunctional TMP-based heterostructures with enhanced overall water splitting activity, as well as the related mechanisms, are discussed in detail. Finally, a summary and perspective for further opportunities and challenges are highlighted for the further development of bifunctional TMP-based heterostructures from the points of practical application and mechanistic studies.									209	8	0	0	9	0	210			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000543751200001

By development of the electrocatalytic material used for the oxygen evolving electrode, great improvements in efficiency can be performed. In electrochemistry, rare metallic oxides RuO2 and IrO2 exhibit the best catalytic properties for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid electrolytes compared to other noble metals. RuO2 is the most active catalyst and IrO2 is the most stable catalyst. An oxide containing both elements is therefore expected to be a good catalyst for the OER. In this study IrxRu1-xO2 nanosized powder electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction is synthesized by hydrolysis method. Cyclic voltammetry, anodic polarization and galvanostatic measurements were conducted in solution of 0.5 M H2SO4 to investigate electrocatalytic behavior and stability of the electrocatalyst. The mechanisms of the thermal decomposition process of RuCl3 center dot nH(2)O and IrCl3 center dot mH(2)O precursors to form oxide powders were studied by means of thermal gravity analysis (TGA). X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used analysis for determination of the crystallographic structure, morphology and catalysts particle size. Based on the given results, the IrxRu1-xO2 (x = 0.5; 0.7) compounds were found to be more active than pure IrO2 and more stable than pure RuO2.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2043-6254	2043-6262		WOS:000355757900017

In this study, a biomass-based carbon nanofiber of Typha domingensis, as available biomass source, and nickel-cobalt oxides is synthesized. The physicochemical techniques including X-ray powder diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, Barrett-Joyner-Halenda, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller as well as electrochemical techniques are used to evaluate the surface morphology, crystal structure, and electrochemical performance of composites.

A membrane electrode assembly is prepared by employing of the produced composite for alkaline passive direct methanol fuel cell, which characterized by polarization, power density curves, methanol crossover test, and stability test for 8 h.

Here, we report by doping a small amount of magnesium (5 %), a phase-pure triple conducting Ba(Co(0.4)Fe(0.4)Z- r(0.1)Y(0.1))0.95Mg(0.05)O(3-delta) (BCFZYM) perovskite is developed as an air electrode for R-PCECs.

R-PCECs with the BCFZYM display excellent performances in both fuel cell (850 mW cm-2 at 600 ?) and electrolysis modes (-1244 mA cm(-2) at 1.3 V at 600 ?). In addition, the R-PCECs show favorable stability in cycling (110 h), electrolysis (200 h) and fuel cell modes (300 h), demonstrating that BCFZYM air electrode has excellent operating stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000862842200001

The Pd decoration yields a higher specific surface area as loading concentrationincreases and leads to the formation of more porous active sites for efficient activity. Both aqueous andorganic media are used to study the electrocatalytic activity of the prepared Pd-LSC composite. Inaqueous media, the Pd-LSC materials exhibit higher ORR and OER activities than native LSC and RuO2. Forexample, as Pd loading increases in aqueous media (5 < 10 < 20 < 30 wt.%), the performance improvesand becomes comparable to the that of a conventional Pt/C catalyst, whereas 20 wt.% loading establishesbetter OER activity. This interesting result in aqueous media logically alerts us to study theelectrocatalytic activity in organic medium toward Li-O2 battery application. Similar to the aqueousmedia, the Pd-LSC composite outperformed the native materials, like LSC and ketjen black. Morespecifically, 30 wt.% loading delivers the highest discharge capacity and longest cycle life compared to theother compositions.

Developing multi-functional electrocatalysts with high performance for HER, OER and ORR still remains a challenge. Herein, we report a facile method to prepare P, N-co-doped porous carbon encapsulated Fe-CoP (A-Fe-CoP/CPN) electrocatalyst through freeze drying, carbonization, and KOH activation. The acquired A-Fe-CoP/CPN possesses abundant pores with large surface area, which provides sufficient defect-rich sites for HER, OER, and ORR, in alkaline or acidic electrolytes. The A-Fe-CoP/CPN shows low overpotential and good stability for HER and OER in alkaline electrolyte. Density functional theory (DFT) computations reveal that the addition of Fe greatly facilitates the rate-determining step and overall catalytic pathway for both HER and OER. A-Fe-CoP/CPN also exhibits low half-wave potential (E1/2) for ORR, which indicates an enhanced performance than that of the noble Pt/C catalyst. Zn-air battery equipped with the A-Fe-CoP/ CPN catalyst exhibits a high energy density (849 mAh g(-1)) and a long-time stability at 5 mA cm-2. This finding not only offers a facile strategy to prepare porous carbon materials with defect-rich sites, but also provides guidance for developing multifunctional electrocatalysts for wide electrochemical reactions.

However, its poor conductivity and few active sites hinder its development in various fields. Therefore, the CoO/MnO heterostructures with abundant oxygen vacancies were prepared on the three-dimensional nickel foam by hydrothermal and vacuum annealed methods.

As well, the CoO/MnO heterostructures presents predominant stability for over 25 h. The excellent OER performance of the Co:Mn = 1:1@NF is mainly attributed to the abundant heterostructures, oxygen vacancies and unique porous structure of nanowires and nanosheets.

Results demonstrate that the highly efficient electroactivity of Co-P/Cu NWs/CF originates from the high intrinsic activity of Co-P species, Cu nanowires which possess accessible active sites, plentiful bubbles releasing channels, and honored electric conductivity, as well as the interaction between Cu NWs and Co-P species. To achieve a current density of 200 mA cm?2, Co-P/Cu NWs/CF require an overpotential of only 155 mV for hydrogen evolution and 349 mV for oxygen evolution, which are less than that of Co-P/Cu(OH)2 NWs/CF and Co-P/CF.

To design such a system, it is necessary to develop active and durable electrocatalysts to catalyze the slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) during discharging and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during charging. In this study, a composite bifunctional catalyst (Co3O4@CNT@MC-200) for use in zinc-air batteries is prepared through a simple sol-gel method, which combines Co3O4 with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and mesoporous carbon (MC). Benefiting from its large specific surface area and, thus, a multitude of active sites, the Co3O4@CNT@MC-200 composite bifunctional electrocatalyst shows excellent ORR performance in 0.1 M KOH, resulting in a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.72 V and limiting diffusion current of 4.6 mAcm(-2). In zinc-air battery tests, a high discharge peak power density of 267 mW cm(-2) and robust lifetime of 8700 min without attenuation is observed.

The CLR process inherently avoids costly cryogenic air separation by replacing gaseous oxygen with regenerable ionic oxygen (O2-) from the catalyst lattice. Our recent studies show that an Fe2O3@La0.8Sr0.2FeO3-delta core-shell redox catalyst is effective for CLR, as it combines the selectivity of an LSF shell with the oxygen capacity of an iron oxide core. The reaction between methane and the catalyst is also found to be highly dynamic, resulting from changes in lattice oxygen availability and surface properties. In this study, a transient pulse injection approach is used to investigate the mechanisms of methane partial oxidation over the Fe2O3@LSF redox catalyst. As confirmed by isotope exchange, the catalyst undergoes transitions between reaction "regions'' with markedly different mechanisms. While oxygen evolution maintains a modified Mars-van Krevelen mechanism throughout the reaction with O2- conduction being the rate limiting step, the mechanism of methane conversion changes from an Eley-Rideal type in the first reaction region to a Langmuir-Hinshelwood-like mechanism in the third region. Availability of surface oxygen controls the reduction scheme of the catalyst and the underlying reaction mechanism.									55	4	0	0	3	0	58			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000365401700057	26549423

Cd2+ is known to exchange, with high affinity in a slow reaction, for the Ca2+ cofactor in the Ca/Mn cluster that constitutes the oxygen-evolving center. This results in inhibition of photosynthetic oxygen evolution. There are also indications that Cd2+ binds to other sites in PSII, potentially to proton channels in analogy to heavy metal binding in photosynthetic reaction centers from purple bacteria. In search for the effects of Cd2+-binding to those sites, we have studied how Cd2+ affects electron transfer reactions in PSII after short incubation times and in sites, which interact with Cd2+ with low affinity. Overall electron transfer and partial electron transfer were studied by a combination of EPR spectroscopy of individual redox components, flash-induced variable fluorescence and steady state oxygen evolution measurements. Several effects of Cd2+ were observed: (i) the amplitude of the flash-induced variable fluorescence was lost indicating that electron transfer from Y-Z to P-680(+) was inhibited; (ii) Q(A)(-) to Q(B) electron transfer was slowed down; (iii) the S-2 state multiline EPR signal was not observable; (iv) steady state oxygen evolution was inhibited in both a high-affinity and a low-affinity site; (v) the spectral shape of the EPR signal from Q(A)(-)Fe(2+) was modified but its amplitude was not sensitive to the presence of Cd2+. In addition, the presence of both Ca2+ and DCMU abolished Cd2+-induced effects partially and in different sites. The number of sites for Cd2+ binding and the possible nature of these sites are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

CHEMELECTROCHEM				7	10			2330	2339		10.1002/celc.202000391				MAY 15 2020	2020	Application of oxide supports is considered as a viable approach to decrease iridium loading in oxygen evolution reaction catalysis in acid electrolyte. While the most of the promising oxides are poor conductors, the need for doping is typically taken as granted, and a representative example is tin dioxide. There are still, however, serious concerns on the feasibility of this approach as we lack consensus on any activity gain by using such oxides, while doubts on stability are numerous. In this work, a set of catalyst/support combinations including two catalysts, viz. hydrous (IrOx) and rutile (IrO2) iridium oxides, and four supports, viz. SnO2 and Sb- (ATO), F- (FTO), and In-doped (ITO) SnO2, are synthesized and characterized by a selection of complementary experimental techniques including rotating disk electrode and on-line inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. It is found that the electrochemical activity in acid media of supported Ir catalysts is essentially the same, independent on presence or absence of dopants. Sb and In dopants are shown to be unstable and cause an increased dissolution of Sn. Besides, the degradation of the doped supports results in destabilization of iridium oxides. These results raise doubts on the real need for the use of dopants in SnO2-based catalyst supports for electrochemical water splitting.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			2196-0216			WOS:000536495700016

Herein, we demonstrated such an efficient catalyst with the structure of self-catalyzed nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube interconnected FeNi/FeF2 derived from hetero-zeolite imidazolate frameworks 8 (ZIF-8) on Fe2Ni MIL (MIL represents Materials of Institut Lavoisier) for oxygen evolution reaction. The obtained catalyst showed efficient synergism of the multicomponents, high polarity, more active sites exposure, increased intrinsic activity, and improved conductivity and stability by a carbon interconnected and confined structure as revealed by the spectroscopic analysis and electrochemical measurements. It required an overpotential of only ca. 240 mV (no iR correction) to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in a KOH solution when loaded on an inert glass carbon electrode, much better than similar kinds of catalysts. The improved catalytic performance can be well correlated to the structural transformation step by step from different MOFs to their derivatives by subsequent carbonation and fluorination. Because of the above-mentioned structural advantages, good catalysis performance of high activity and stability, faster catalytic kinetics, and facile active phase formation were observed compared to those of other similar materials. This work offers a new platform of derivatives from hetero MOF-on-MOF for catalysis reactions.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2637-9368		WOS:000802236800001

However, traditional 2D nanomaterials are easily re-stacked into dense structures or films when manufactured into practical electrodes. Herein, we report an efficient approach to construct amorphous holey NiMS nanosheets (M = Co, Fe, Mn) to overcome this difficulty. Taking amorphous holey NiCoS nanosheets (denoted as holey NiCoS-NS) as a model material, we illustrate the feasibility of this method to control the hole size and pore density in the nanosheets by altering the time of sulfidation process. Benefiting from porous 2D architecture, S-doped species, synergistic effects of Ni and Co, as well as amorphous nature, the holey NiCoS-NS exhibit a low overpotential of 280 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent stability in 1.0 M KOH. By the X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) analysis, this enhanced performance is ascribe to the in-situ generated Ni/Co oxy(hydroxide) active phase during oxygen evolution reaction. Besides, when further employed as a two-electrode electrolyzer assembly, the holey NiCoS-NS exhibits a low potential of 1.58 Vat 20 mA cm(-2), serving as one of the best water-splitting electrocatalysts to date. This work not only provides a feasible strategy to develop efficient and durable OER catalysts but also represents a general strategy for the structure-performance relationship of 2D transition metal sulfide electrocatalysts.

Among various excellent OER catalysts, RuO2 has shown excellent catalytic activity and good electrical conductivity. Here, a bifunctional catalyst with RuO2 well dispersed on NiCo2O4 nanosheets has been studied, showing a low OER Tafel slope of as low as 58 mV/decade in alkaline media. While assembled in Li-O-2 batteries with RuO2@NiCo2O4 cathode, a large specific discharge capacity as high as 17,633 mAh g(-1) can be obtained at a current density of 200mA g(-1) with a coulombic efficiency of 91%. A long-term stability about 128 cycles can be achieved without much deterioration. The excellent electrochemical performance is strongly correlated with the nanosheets like structure for easy O-2 diffusion, electrolyte permeation, sufficient space provision of Li2O2 deposition and cooperation of NiCo2O4 and RuO2, which exhibits excellent ORR (oxygen reduction reaction) and OER catalytic activity respectively.

Interfacial engineering on the rationally designed heterostructure can regulate the electronic states efficiently for intrinsic activity improvement. Here, we report a co-phosphorization approach to construct a VPO4-Ni2P heterostructure on nickel foam with strongly chemical binding, wherein phosphate acts as electronic modifier for Ni2P electrocatalyst. Profiting from the interfacial interaction, it is uncovered that electron shifts from Ni2P to VPO4 to render valence increment in Ni species. Such an electronic manipulation rationalizes the chemical affinities of various oxygen intermediates in OER pathway, giving a substantially reduced energy barrier. As a result, the advanced VPO4-Ni2P heterostructure only requires an overpotential of 289 mV to deliver a high current density of 350 mA/cm(2) for OER in alkaline electrolyte, together with a Tafel slope as low as 28 mV/dec.

Carbon-coated Co (C@Co) catalysts were prepared by the direct calcination of Co-3(SDA)(3)(DMF)(2) MOF crystals at various temperatures. The highest surface area of the C@Co catalyst is obtained at 600 degrees C which can further be increased by the ball mill operation. The X-ray photon spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis proved the formation of metallic Co in the carbon matrix at temperatures over 500 degrees C, while Co3O4 formation was observed at 500 degrees C. Furthermore, the graphitic properties of the Co particles were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy. The durability of the carbon-coated Co catalysts derived from MOFs (C@Co catalysts) was analyzed by the cycle test (charge/discharge at 20 mA/cm(2) per 2 h) and was retained over 350 h.

Here, an unprecedented activity of bifunctional electrocatalyst is reported by in situ growth of nitrogen-enriched carbon nanotubes with transition metal composite. The resultant catalyst delivers surprisingly high OER (potential@10 mA cm(-2) of 1.58 V) and ORR (onset potential of 0.97 V, half-wave potential of 0:86 V) performance. The overall oxygen electrode activity (overvoltage between ORR and OER) of the catalyst is as low as 0.72 V. In aqueous Zn-air battery tests, primary batteries demonstrate high maximum power density and two-electrode rechargeable batteries also exhibit good cycle performance. The unprecedented electrocatalyst opens up new avenues for developing highly active nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube-supported electrocatalysts and offers prospects for the next generation of fuel cells, metal air batteries, and photocatalysis applications.									46	1	0	0	2	0	47			1944-8244			WOS:000404807200019	28581707

Moreover, the Co9S8/CD@NSC catalyst also displays a superior activity and cycling stability as a cathode material in ZABs, which is far better than Pt/C + RuO2 mixture catalysts.

Herein, we investigated the crystal plane effects of NiO on the electrocatalytic OER activity through combining experimental studies and theoretical calculations. The experimental results reveal that NiO nanobelts with exposed {110} crystal planes show much higher OER activity than NiO nanoplates with exposed {111} planes. The efficient OER activity of the {110} crystal planes comes from their intrinsically high catalytic ability and fast charge transfer kinetics. Density functional theory (DFT) shows that the {110} crystal planes possess a lower theoretical overpotential value for the OER, leading to a high electrocatalytic performance. This research broadens our vision to design efficient OER electrocatalysts by the selective exposure of specific crystal planes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000760907100001	35212332

Recently, progress has been made in pushing the limits of water splitting efficiency by incorporating NiOOH in photo-electrochemical cell architectures. Despite these cutting-edge advances, some basic questions have yet been fully answered. This perspective highlights the three most critical questions that are considered to be the very first step for any theoretical investigation. We suggest possible ways to answer these questions from a theoretician's perspective. Progress toward this direction is expected to shed light on the origin of NiOOH's success.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			1432-881X	1432-2234		WOS:000380250400001

Herein, a scalable method is implemented to design a very active heteroatom cofunctionalized carbon nanorods with bifunctional electrocatalytic activity via structural transformation of the cellulose fibers from waste tissue paper. Cobalt (Co) is used as both a promoter-catalyst to induce structural evolution of the nanorods, and a self-doped catalyst moiety by coupling with sulfur and nitrogen to enhance the electrocatalytic properties. The obtained catalyst (Co9S8@Co-N/C nanorods) displays high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, resulting in a small overall water splitting potential of 1.61 V@10mA cm(-2) and high electrochemical stability for over 70 h. This synthesis approach is further demonstrated to be very suitable for implementation toward large-scale application and can reproduce consistent catalytic properties, which are highly desirable for mass hydrogen production.

However, a significant challenge is limited by the poor electrical conductivity and the rapid recombination rate of photogenerated carriers. This paper reports a facile and effective way to synthesize the WO3 NWs with oxygen vacancies (Ov-WO3 NWs), which have high PEC OER activity and good stability. Photoelectric measurements indicate that the Ov-WO3 NW-based device shows a good light-harvesting property under visible light and a prolonged photoresponse time.

Monitoring the potential as well as the mass spectrometric signal transients of the possible reaction products CO2 (carbon oxidation reaction - COR) and O-2 (oxygen evolution reaction - OER) upon switching from H-2-saturated to N-2-saturated electrolyte under galvanostatic oxidation conditions, we find a rapid increase of the potential to values at about 1.75 V upon electrolyte exchange, together with the onset of CO2 formation and O-2 evolution, where the latter dominates at high potentials. The ratio of O-2 evolution and carbon support oxidation differs significantly for different catalyst supports, with the COR contributing more for the carbon-containing catalysts in the initial stage of the fuel starvation period, and the OER prevailing for the Pt/TiO2 catalyst over the whole starvation time. The complex interplay between different catalyst degradation processes during fuel starvation is discussed. (c) The Author(s) 2018.

However, the heteroatom-doped carbon material including a carbon-based conductive additive would be easily oxidized under the high potential needed for driving the OER. Besides, the interaction between the heteroatom-doped carbon material that possesses electrocatalyst activity and a carbon-based conductive additive is weak, affecting the performance of the electrocatalyst. In this context, we introduce CoS nanoparticles into a three-dimensional N-doped carbon framework (CoS/NCF) by a morphology-retaining pyrolysis of polyaniline/CoS framework precursor, in which the polyaniline framework provides abundant functional groups to nucleate and grow CoS nanoparticles while retaining its interconnected three-dimensional porous structure. Benefiting from (i) the lower OER potential of CoS nanoparticles than the electro-oxidation decomposition potential of a carbon material and (ii) the strong affinity of CoS nanoparticles for a N-doped carbon framework, higher stability than commercial Pt/C system and greater catalytic activity towards ORR with an onset potential of about 0.921 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) are observed. Furthermore, only a potential of 1.515 V versus RHE is required for achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2).									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000444906500001	30156562

In particular, NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) can be directly derived from the surface metal of commercial NiFe foam (NFF).

In this study, we report an efficient OER electrocatalyst of CeOx (unary oxide) and NiFe-OH (bimetallic hydroxide) electrochemically deposited on a macroporous nickel foam substrate. The synthesized electrocatalyst exhibits remarkably improved OER performance by reaching a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 280 mV, which is quite superior to that of most of the previously reported non-noble-metalbased OER electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the developed catalyst demonstrated a minor Tafel slope of 43.2 mV dec(-1) with good stability under a large current at a continuous operation of 80 000 s in a strong alkaline electrolyte. Experimental observations revealed that the combination of CeOx and NiFe-OH accelerates the electroadsorption energies between the electrocatalyst surface and oxygen intermediates, considerably contributing to the OER enhancement. These results undoubtedly represent an important milestone toward the development of efficient OER electrocatalysts for applications as industrial water electrolyzers.									23	1	0	0	1	0	23			2168-0485			WOS:000489986400061

Assuming the occurrence of hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction as the cathodic counterparts of the iron oxidation under a predetermined kinetic model, the corresponding kinetic parameters were obtained applying a numerical method to experimental data. It was found that, despite of the close similarities observed between corrosion behavior of carbon steel in LiBr, NaCl and the mixture LiBr+NaCl, there are distinct differences in kinetics for partial reactions. Some relevant aspects are the significant differences for iron oxidation and hydrogen evolution in the kinetics parameters that indicates higher kinetic rate for LiBr in comparison with NaCl solutions. This can be related with morphological attributes of the pits. For oxygen reduction the fluid dynamics regime and transport properties of the electrolyte of each salt solution are the main factors affecting the oxygen kinetic behavior.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1452-3981			WOS:000359199100038

However, the oxygen redox process leads to lattice oxygen loss and structure degradation, which would induce serious voltage fade and capacity loss and thus limit the practical application. High-valent and electrochemical inactive d(0) element doping is an effective method to tune the crystal and electronic structures, which are the main factors for the electrochemical stability. Herein, noticeably inhibited oxygen loss, reduced voltage fade, enhanced rate performance, and improved structure stability and thermal stability of LMRs have been realized by Ti4+ and Zr4+ dual-doping. The underlying modulation mechanisms are unraveled by combining differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, soft X-ray absorption spectroscopies, in situ XRD measurements, etc. The dual-doping reduces the covalency of the TM-O bond, mitigates the irreversible oxygen release during the oxygen redox, and stabilizes the layered framework. The expanded lithium layer facilitates the lithium diffusion kinetics and structure stability. This study may result in the fundamental understanding of crystal and electronic structure evolution in LMRs and contribute to the development of high capacity cathodes.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000757862500001	35073038

We chose LiMn2O4 as a model system for mechanistic investigations as it shares the cubane structure with the active site of photosystem II and the valence of Mn3.5+ with the dark-stable S1 state in the mechanism of natural photosynthesis. The investigated LiMn2O4 nanoparticles are electrochemically stable in NaOH electrolytes and show respectable activity in any of the main metrics. At low overpotential, the key mechanistic parameters of Tafel slope, Nernst slope, and reaction order have constant values on the RHE scale of 62(1) mVdec(-1), 1(1) mVpH(-1), -0.04(2), respectively. These values are interpreted in the context of the well-studied mechanism of natural photosynthesis. The uncovered difference in the reaction sequence is important for the design of efficient bio-inspired electrocatalysts.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000416158500024	28921902

However, few studies have concentrated on VB element dichalcogenides. Herein, we report that trifunctional 2H-TaS2 nanoflakes exhibit high performance when applied in supercapacitors, hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). Notably, TaS2 nanoflakes delivered a large volumetric capacitance (502 F cm(-3) at the scan rate of 10 mV s(-1)) and remarkable cycling stability (over 91% after 5000 cycles). TaS2 nanoflakes also exhibited remarkable catalytic performances in HER and OER processes, showing very small overpotentials and Tafel slopes, which are far better than those of the previously reported TaS2 electrocatalysts. Furthermore, TaS2 is highly stable in both alkaline and acidic electrolyte solutions. This work offers a new concept to design VB element-based electrodes for future energy storage and conversion applications.									21	2	0	0	0	0	21			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000507989900012	31746891

Spontaneous doping of the basal plane of MoS2 single-layers through oxygen substitution under ambient conditions [arXiv]								arXiv								26 pp.	26 pp.						2 April 2019	2019	The chemical inertness of the defect-free basal plane confers environmental stability to MoS2 single-layers, but it also limits their chemical versatility and catalytic activity. The stability of the pristine MoS2 basal plane against oxidation under ambient conditions is a widely accepted assumption in the interpretation of various studies and applications. However, single-atom level structural investigations reported here reveal that oxygen atoms spontaneously incorporate into the basal plane of MoS2 single layers during ambient exposure. Our scanning tunneling microscopy investigations reveal a slow oxygen substitution reaction, upon which individual sulfur atoms are one by one replaced by oxygen, giving rise to solid solution type 2D MoS2-xOx crystals. O substitution sites present all over the basal plane act as single-atomic active reaction centers, substantially increasing the catalytic activity of the entire MoS2 basal plane for the electrochemical H2 evolution reaction.

Herein, the authors prepare Ni-IrOx composite catalysts consisting of NiO and IrO2 for the OER by a solid-state reaction with different ratios of NiO to IrO2 and reaction temperatures. In particular, Ni-IrOx-400 with a molar ratio of NiO/IrO2 = 1:1 heated at 400 degrees C shows the best OER performance. In the overall water splitting test using an anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzer, the single cell with Ni-IrOx-400 as the anode catalyst shows current densities of 1454.8 mA cm(-2), respectively, measured at 1.8 V. Furthermore, the stability tests of the AEM single cells are carried out at 50 degrees C under a constant current density of 500 mA cm(-2). The single cell with Ni-IrOx-400 shows only a slight increase in the overpotential (rate: 2.0 mV h(-1)) for 100 h owing to the enhanced stability of Ni-IrOx-400 compared to IrO2 (12.5 mV h(-1)). The improved OER performance of the Ni-IrOx-400 may be attributed to a composite structure that can prevent particle agglomeration and thus preserve the active sites during the OER.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2196-7350			WOS:000739192300001

In this work, we show that the activity of the NiFe-LDHs can be tailored by the intercalated anions with different redox potentials. The intercalation of anions with low redox potential (high reducing ability), such as hypophosphites, leads to NiFe-LDHs with low OER overpotential of 240 mV and a small Tafel slope of 36.9 mV/dec, whereas NiFe-LDHs intercalated with anions of high redox potential (low reducing ability), such as fluorion, show a high overpotential of 370 mV and a Tafel slope of 80.8 mV/dec. The OER activity shows a surprising linear correlation with the standard redox potential. Density functional theory calculations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis indicate that the intercalated anions alter the electronic structure of metal atoms which exposed at the surface. Anions with low standard redox potential and strong reducing ability transfer more electrons to the hydroxide layers. This increases the electron density of the surface metal sites and stabilizes their high-valence states, whose formation is known as the critical step prior to the OER process.									105	10	0	0	9	0	107			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000424049300017

For the first time, a Cu-based MOF, i.e., Cu-NPMOF is used, whose linkers contain nitrogen and phosphorus heteroatoms, as a single precursor and template to prepare novel Cu3P nanoparticles (NPs) coated by a N,P-codoped carbon shell that is extended to a hierarchical porous carbon matrix with identical uniform N and P doping (termed Cu3P@NPPC) as an electrocatalyst. Cu3P@NPPC demonstrates outstanding activity for both the hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reaction, representing the first example of a Cu3P-based bifunctional catalyst for energy-conversion reactions. The high performances are ascribed to the high specific surface area, the synergistic effects of the Cu3P NPs with intrinsic activity, the protection of the carbon shell, and the hierarchical porous carbon matrix doped by multiheteroatoms. This strategy of using a diverse MOF as a structural and compositional material to create a new multifunctional composite/hybrid may expand the opportunities to explore highly efficient and robust non-noble-metal catalysts for energy-conversion reactions.									480	28	0	0	22	0	484			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000424485100005	29266417

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can act as precursors to the design and construct of varied nanostructured materials which may be difficult to produce in other ways. Herein, we put forward a serial ion-exchange reaction and selenation strategy to prepare novel yolk-shelled Ni-Co-Se dodecahedral nanocages on carbon fiber paper (Y-S Ni-Co-Se/CFP). ZIF-67@LDH/CFP was first synthesized by a simple ion-exchange reaction, followed by a hydrothermal selenation process to form Y-S Ni-Co-Se/CFP. Moreover, the composition of the as-prepared yolk shelled Ni-Co-Se nanocages was a mixture of Co0.85Se and Ni0.85Se (Co/Ni atomic ratio of about 2.42). Due to their structural and compositional merits, the as-prepared Y-S Ni-Co-Se/CFP exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability (over 80% current retention for at least 18 h) for both HER and OER For HER, it required an overpotential of 250 mV to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which was 162 mV less than that of the Y-S Co0.85Se/CFP counterpart. The catalyst also efficiently catalyzed OER with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 300 mV, which was lower than those of other reported Co-based catalysts.									83	4	0	0	2	0	83			2168-0485			WOS:000441475500153

The series of MoS2@CoNi-ZIF nanocomposites exhibit different catalytic activities. Significantly, the MoS2@CoNi-ZIF nanosheet with a ratio of MoS2:CoNi-ZIF = 3:1 (MoS2@CoNi-ZIF(3-1)) shows the excellent electrocatalytic activity for MOR, affording an oxidation potential at 1.6 V, also with high catalytic current density and durability. Moreover, the MoS2@CoNi-ZIF(3-1) nano composite shows a superior electrocatalytic performance toward HER and OER. When the MoS2@CoNi-ZIF(3-1) was applied as the bifunctional catalyst for both the anode and cathode, the voltage applied to a two-electrode cell is 1.55V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting.

Herein, peptide Z1 is employed to fabricate a series of AuPt alloyed nanoparticles with different Au-to-Pt ratios. The morphology is examined by electron microscopic techniques, and well-defined peanut-shape is observed for Au33Pt67 while spherical particles are obtained for the other samples. The AuPt alloys demonstrate effective electrocatalytic activity toward both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and Au33Pt67 exhibits the best bifunctional electrocatalytic performance. Its ORR activity is superior than commercial Pt/C in alkaline media, verified by the positive onset potential (thorn1.02 V vs. RHE) and large diffusion-limited current density, while its HER activity is comparable with Pt/C, evidenced by the small overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) (-171 mV vs. RHE) and low Tafel slope. Moreover, Au33Pt67 exhibits markedly higher long-term durability than Pt/C for both ORR and HER. The excellent activity and stability for ORR and HER are ascribed to Au alloying Pt induced synergistic effects. The results highlight the advantages of using peptide to fabricate bi-functional or multiple functional electrocatalysts with desirable activity and robust stability. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

When used as electrocatalysts for the ORR, an onset potential of 0.92 V vs. RHE has been achieved for NCHCs. A nega-tive shift of only 61 mV exists in the half-wave potential of NCHCs compared to that of the commercial Pt/C (20 wt%). Moreover, the NCHCs show high activity for the OER comparable to that of commercial RuO2/C (20 wt%). The sustainable conversion of biomass lysine to heteroatom-doped carbon hollow cubes and the recyclability of the NaCl template allow a scalable production and practical application of carbon materials for energy storage and conversion.									97	9	0	0	5	0	102			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000394781100010	27824190

Hydrogen energy is proposed to be one of the major substitutes to fill the gap between the production plant and consumer. The energy from renewable power sources is used to generate hydrogen, which is later converted to electricity and water. Hydrogen generation in water electrolysis from renewable energy is a sustainable process. However, the need for membrane separation of hydrogen from oxygen in single-cell water electrolysis is detrimental. Moreover, the hydrogen production rate in conventional single-cell electrolysers is strictly limited by the rate of oxygen evolution. Recently decoupled water electrolysis has been proposed where hydrogen and oxygen are generated in spatially separated alkaline cells. Here we demonstrate amphoteric decoupled electrolysis by using an auxiliary electrode (AE) couple with HxWO3 and NiOOH being employed in separate acid and alkaline cells, respectively. The average electrolysis efficiency of the proposed concept is up to 71%, higher than that observed from decoupled electrolysis where both cells are alkaline.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000778402000001

The different methodologies for the determination of the potential of zero charge are reviewed. After that, a thorough examination of the effect of surface charge on different electrochemical reactions of interest is carried out. The acid-base dissociation constants on the surface or the kinetics of relevant electrocatalytic reactions such as nitrate and peroxodisulfate reduction, formic acid oxidation, oxygen and hydrogen peroxide reduction or hydrogen evolution is affected by the interfacial charge.

Here we report a free-standing amorphous nanostructured oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst with microvoids developed by embedding Gd-doped Mn3O4 nanosheets in a CuO-Cu(OH)(2) nanostructure array (Gd-Mn3O4@ CuO-Cu(OH)(2). The surface oxygen vacancies modulated the electronic structure of the catalyst and offered active sites with optimal chemisorption energy to OER intermediates. The hierarchical surface structure provides a large specific surface area, high electrical conductivity, ionic mobility, intrinsic activity for each active site, and efficient charge transfer, leading to an outstanding catalytic performance. The enhanced structural, chemical, and corrosion resistance ensures effectiveness as an anode in direct seawater electrolysis. Specifically, it needs an input voltage of 1.63 V to deliver a current density of 500 mA cm(-2) in alkaline seawater, with the stability of more than 75 h of continuous electrolysis without hypochlorite formation. The high Faradaic efficiency demonstrates its potential for hydrogen fuel production from seawater.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000758306400001	35138809

However, global models designed to describe as many materials as possible might overlook the very few compounds that have the appropriate adsorption properties to be suitable for a given catalytic process. Here, the subgroup-discovery (SGD) local artificial-intelligence approach is used to identify the key descriptive parameters and constrains on their values, the so-called SG rules, which particularly describe transition-metal surfaces with outstanding adsorption properties for the oxygen-reduction and-evolution reactions. We start from a data set of 95 oxygen adsorption-energy values evaluated by density-functional-theory calculations for several monometallic surfaces along with 16 atomic, bulk and surface properties as candidate descriptive parameters. From this data set, SGD identifies constraints on the most relevant parameters describing materials and adsorption sites that (i) result in O adsorption energies within the Sabatier-optimal range required for the oxygen-reduction reaction and (ii) present the largest deviations from the linear-scaling relations between O and OH adsorption energies, which limit the catalyst performance in the oxygen-evolution reaction. The SG rules not only reflect the local underlying physicochemical phenomena that result in the desired adsorption properties, but also guide the challenging design of alloy catalysts.									7	0	0	0	0	0	6			1022-5528	1572-9028		WOS:000692059200002	35185306

Several methodologies have been developed to expedite the OER process. However, producing catalysts with excellent performance still remains challenging. Herein, we successfully achieve an enhanced OER performance in amorphous (CO1-xFex)(2)BOy(OH)(z) (x = 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50%) by improving electrode kinetics. The incorporation of Fe3+ not only improves the charge transfer rate, but also modulates the absorption ability of Fe3+ ions to hydroxyl, as evidenced by the decrease of 3d electron density from the Mossbauer measurement. As a consequence, (CO0.7Fe0.3)2BOy(OH)z shows a superior electrocatalytic performance with a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) at an overpotential of 308 mV and a Tafel slope of 39 mV dec(-1), which are smaller than those observed for undoped parent catalyst Co2BOy(OH)z and commercial IrO2. Moreover, (Co0.7Fe0.3)2BO(y)(OH)(z) catalyst has a high stability in OER electrocatalytic process. The current density still remains about 70% after continuous electrocatalytic reaction for 12 h. (Co0.7Fe0.3) 2BO(y)(OH)(z) used as anode also catalyzes overall water splitting reaction to give a current density of 20 mAcm(-2) at 1.62 V when taking Pt/C catalyst as cathode. The present study provides an effective approach to design new metal-based electrocatalystsby introducing foreign cation to alter outer electron density and further modulating the electrochemical activity.

Electrocatalysts play a key role in the development of electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices. Especially, developing efficient and cost-effective catalysts is important for the large-scale application of these devices. Among various electrocatalyst candidates, earth abundant transition metal compound (TMC)-based electrocatalysts are being widely and rapidly studied owing to their high electrocatalytic performances. This paper reviews the recent and representative advances in efficient TMC-based electrocatalysts (i.e., oxides, sulfides, selenides, phosphides, carbides and nitrides) for energy electrocatalytic reactions, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Different compounds with different applications are summarized and the relative mechanisms are also discussed. The strategies for developing earth-abundant and low-cost TMC-based electrocatalysts are introduced. In the end, the current challenges and future perspectives in the development of TMC research are briefly discussed. This review also provides the latest advance and outlines the frontiers in TMC-based electrocatalysts, which should provide inspirations for the further development of low-cost and high-efficiency catalysts for sustainable clean energy technologies.									23	6	0	0	1	0	23			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000569057900002

Four types of spinel-structural materials (Mn3O4, Fe3O4, MnFe2O4, and Mn2FeO4) are prepared as OER electrocatalysts. The spinel MnFe2O4/NF electrode exhibits the best OER activity in a 1.0 M KOH alkaline electrolyte. The required electrode potential to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is only 1.54 V (with eta = 310 mV), and a low Tafel slope of 65 mV dec(-1) is obtained. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of MnFe2O4/NF before and after OER found out that OER activity was promoted due to oxygen vacancies in the spinel lattice, and the high catalytic activity was maintained for a long time by the self-redox property between Mn and Fe ions. Finally, the corrosion resistance, which is directly related to the catalytic activity and stability of MnFe2O4/NF, is demonstrated through a 3000th-repeated OER acceleration stability and 1000 h-durability tests, with a high faradaic efficiency of 95.2%. Eventually, this study presents a new paradigm for energy production that enables the continuous and easy generation of hydrogen and oxygen via water electrolysis using high-performance and inexpensive iron-manganese-based electrocatalysts.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000620786600003

Iron oxide deposition showed a saturating growth rate of 0.1 angstrom/cycle in the temperature range of 150 degrees C to 250 degrees C. The iron oxide coating was subsequently deposited on a porous gas diffusion layer (GDL) for use as an air electrode in a zinc-air battery. X-ray microanalysis confirmed deep penetration of the iron oxide into the porosity of the GDL, with a lower substrate temperature providing deeper coverage. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that a uniform similar to 10 nm thick iron oxide coating encased the GDL particles.

J	Noguchi, Takumi; Suzuki, Hiroyuki; Tsuno, Masaya; Sugiura, Miwa; Kato, Chihiro				Noguchi, Takumi/I-7105-2014				Time-Resolved Infrared Detection of the Proton and Protein Dynamics during Photosynthetic Oxygen Evolution								BIOCHEMISTRY				51	15			3205	3214		10.1021/bi300294n				APR 17 2012	2012	Photosynthetic oxygen evolution by plants and cyanobacteria is performed by water oxidation at the Mn4CaO5 cluster in photosystem II. The reaction is known to proceed via a light-driven cycle of five intermediates called S-i states (i = 0-4). However, the detailed reaction processes during the intermediate transitions remain unresolved. In this study, we have directly detected the proton and protein dynamics during the oxygen-evolving reactions using time-resolved infrared spectroscopy. The time courses of the absorption changes at 1400 and 2500 cm(-1), which represent the reactions and/or interaction changes of carboxylate groups and the changes in proton polarizability of strong hydrogen bonds, respectively, were monitored upon flash illumination. The results provided experimental evidence that during the S-3 -> S-0 transition, drastic proton rearrangement, most likely reflecting the release of a proton from the catalytic site, takes place to form a transient state before the oxidation of the Mn4CaO5 cluster that leads to O-2 formation. Early proton movement was also detected during the S-2 -> S-3 transition. These observations reveal the common mechanism in which proton release facilitates the transfer of an electron from the Mn4CaO5 cluster in the S-2 and S-3 states that already accumulate oxidizing equivalents. In addition, relatively slow rearrangement of carboxylate groups was detected in the S-0 -> S-1 transition, which could contribute to the stabilization of the S-1 state. This study demonstrates that time-resolved infrared detection is a powerful method for elucidating the detailed molecular mechanism of photosynthetic oxygen evolution by pursuing the reactions of substrate and amino acid residues during the S-state transitions.									57	1	0	0	32	0	57			0006-2960			WOS:000302841200007	22458839

However, the high thermodynamic potential (1.23 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode) and slow kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) restrict the wide application of electrocatalytic water splitting. Replacing OER by hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) with lower oxidizing potential can effectively increase the energy efficiency and save the cost of production. Thus, for the hydrazine-assisted electrolytic hydrogen production, transition-metal-based (TM-based) mate-rials are developed to work as efficient electrocatalysts, due to the facile tuning of their physicochemical properties and their low costs. In this review, we summarize the latest advances on the TM-based cat-alysts for hydrazine-assisted hydrogen production, with focus on the catalytic properties and mecha-nisms. Moreover, several key issues of the hydrogen production process and perspectives are discussed to give insight into the foundation for the future development of hydrazine-assisted electrolytic hydrogen production.

The visible carbon concentration profile was measured using an image analysis system with an optical microscope. A model was formulated to describe the removal of visible carbon in terms of oxygen diffusion and reaction, and the equations were solved numerically. Estimates of the effective diffusion coefficient and the effective reaction rate constant were obtained by fitting the experimental visible carbon profiles to those calculated with the model. Between 370 and 460-degrees-C, the rate of removal of visible carbon was found to be affected by both oxygen diffusion through the porous network and chemical oxidation. Assuming the kinetics to be first order in both oxygen concentration and visible carbon concentration, the effective diffusion coefficient for oxygen is (3.1 +/- 1.8) x 10(-8) m2 s-1 and the effective reaction rate constant is 0.021 +/- 0.012 m3 mol-1 s-1.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0022-3093			WOS:A1994NE05000021

Besides the traditional noble-metal or transition metal oxide-based catalysts, carbonaceous electrocatalysts are of great interest due to their huge structural and compositional variety and unrestricted abundance. This review provides a summary of recent advances in the field of carbon-based OER catalysts ranging from "pure" or unintentionally doped carbon allotropes over heteroatom-doped carbonaceous materials and carbon/transition metal compounds to metal oxide composites where the role of carbon is mainly assigned to be a conductive support. Furthermore, the review discusses the recent developments in the field of ordered carbon framework structures (metal organic framework and covalent organic framework structures) that potentially allow a rational design of heteroatom-doped 3D porous structures with defined composition and spatial arrangement of doping atoms to deepen the understanding on the OER mechanism on carbonaceous structures in the future. Besides introducing the structural and compositional origin of electrochemical activity, the review discusses the mechanism of the catalytic activity of carbonaceous materials, their stability under OER conditions, and potential synergistic effects in combination with metal (or metal oxide) co-catalysts.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000646539900001	33942507

However, severe chemical corrosion, sluggish reaction kinetics as well as extremely low photovoltage are critical limitations hampering its PEC performance. This paper describes the introduction of a metallic nickel (Ni) thin film as a multifunctional layer that 1) forms a Schottky junction to extract a high photovoltage, 2) provides an electrocatalytic surface for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and 3) protects Si against corrosion. Upon introducing a high-quality Al2O3 tunneling layer to optimize the Si/Ni interface and loading nickel oxide hydroxide to further accelerate the OER, this metal-insulator-semiconductor junction photoanode achieves a record high photovoltage of 640 mV and energy conversion efficiency of 3% in n-Si based photoanodes without np or np(+) buried homojunction, yielding an air mass 1.5G photocurrent density of approximate to 28 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) for oxygen evolution in alkaline solution with a stability of more than 80 h.									29	2	0	0	0	0	29			2366-9608			WOS:000490288400008

We first report the synthesis of wormhole-like mesoporous tin oxide (MTO-S) by using sodium lauroyl sarcosinate as structure directing agent under hydrothermal reaction conditions followed by calcination and loading with IrO2 or Pt nanoparticles at its surface by simple wet-chemical methods. These IrO2 and Pt-loaded SnO2 nanomaterials are thoroughly characterized by small and wide-angle powder XRD, nitrogen adsorption/desorption analysis, FTIR, XPS spectroscopy, UHR-TEM, FE-SEM, TG/DTA and NH3-TPD analysis. The electrochemical water splitting measurements of the IrO2 and Pt doped mesoporous SnO2 nanostructured materials suggested fine dispersion of these metal/metal oxide nanoparticles at the mesopore surface and facile electron hopping could enhance the rate of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of IrO2@MTO-S and Pt@MTO-S nanocomposites, respectively. As a result, the IrO2@MTO-S modified electrode exhibits unprecedented OER activity with a very low overpotential of 240mV at 10mAcm(-2), which is lower than the state-of-the-art catalyst IrO2/C (360mV) and other reported catalysis. Pt@MTO-S also exhibit excellent HER activity with an ultralow overpotential of 73mV at 10mAcm(-2). These findings may uncover new opportunities for IrO2@MTO-S and Pt@MTO-S as OER and HER electrocatalysts for future water electrolysis.									51	0	0	0	1	0	51			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000457144200051

The catalysts have been prepared on stainless steel non-woven fabrics as electro-catalytic materials by sol gel deposition [1,2]. Thin films were deposited by dip-coating multi step process to increase the thickness of the thin film and then sintered at different temperatures for 1 h. Electrochemical studies are carried out to test the catalytic activity for the OER in alkaline media. Surface morphology and composition of the catalysts were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive analysis of X-ray. Polarization curves prepared in a half-cell setup with 1 M KOH electrolyte at room temperature reveal a 400 mV difference between the developed CoNi oxide catalysts [3]. The catalysts with the best electrochemical properties will be tested in an experimental anion exchange membrane electrolysis cell under real conditions.

Herein, a cobalt-nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst Co-UA-OCB with heavy nitrogen content has been synthesized. The N-doped graphene sheets from carbonized uric acid wrapped on the particles of carbon black to construct a hierarchical microstructure. Benefiting from the higher electrochemical active surface area and well dispersed cobalt particles, the catalyst exhibits a remarkable bifunctional activity toward oxygen reduction (ORR) and evolution reactions (OER) with 0.834 V of half-wave potential for ORR and 1.621 V of OER potential at 10 mA cm(2). The rechargeable Zn-air battery fabricated with Co-UA-OCB as the air electrode, delivers 142 mW cm(-2) of maximum power density, 799 mAh g(-1) of specific capacity, 1000 mWh g(-1) of energy density and 1.24-1.29 V of running voltage at 10 mA cm(2) of current density.

The rich chemistry of TMDs combined with graphene allows tuning of the electrocatalytic properties to develop an efficient, sustainable, and affordable catalyst for overall water splitting reaction. This work compares the electrocatalytic efficiency of the 2D VSe2/rGO (reduced graphene oxide) hybrids with the pristine. The high-performance 2D VSe2/rG080 electrode exhibits a low overpotential and Tafel slope to strike current density of 10 mA/cm(2) (Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER): 110 mV, 147 mV/dec; Oxygen evolution reaction (OER): 280 mV, 77 mV/dec). Excellent durability over 3 h under alkaline conditions proves it to be efficient for realistic energy conversion applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2522-5731	2522-574X		WOS:000658577400002

Hydrogen is considered an ideal solution as it can be produced electrochemically by water electrolysis and renewably while no pollutants are released when consumed. The most common catalysts in electrolyzers are composed of rare and expensive precious group metals. Replacing these materials with Earth-abundant materials is important to make these devices economically viable. Metal organic frameworks are one possible solution. Herein we demonstrate the synthesis and characterization studies of metal benzene-tri-carboxylic acid-based metal-organic frameworks embedded in activated carbon. The conductive composite material was found to be electrocatalytically active for both the oxygen evolution reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction. Furthermore, several metal organic frameworks sharing the same ligand but with different first-row transition metals (M = Co, Cu, Fe, Mn) were compared, and the trend of their activity is discussed. Cobalt was found to have the highest activity among the studied metal centers, and therefore has the best potential to serve as a bifunctional catalyst for alkaline electrolyzers.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000625280200019	33600541

In this study, a novel process starting with Cu_2O cubes was developed to fabricate hollow Ni_xCo_(1-x)Se nanocages as trifunctional electrocatalysts for the OER, ORR, and HER and a reasonable formation mechanism was proposed. The Ni_(0.2)Co_(0.8)Se nanocages exhibited higher OER activity than its counterparts with the low overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm-2. It also outperformed the other samples in the HER test with a low overpotential of 73 mV at 10 mA cm~(-2). As an air-cathode of a self-assembled rechargeable ZAB, it exhibited good performance, such as an ultralong cycling lifetime of > 50 h, a high round-trip efficiency of 60.86%, and a high power density of 223.5 mW cm~(-2). For the application in self-made all-solid-state ZAB, it also demonstrated excellent performance with a power density of 41.03 mW cm~(-2) and an open-circuit voltage of 1.428 V. In addition, Ni_(0.2)Co_(0.8)Se nanocages had superior performance in a practical overall water splitting, in which only 1.592 V was needed to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm~(-2). These results show that hollow Ni_xCo_(1- x)Se nanocages with an optimized Ni-to-Co ratio are a promising cost-effective and high-efficiency electrocatalyst for ZABs and overall water splitting in alkaline solutions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2311-6706			CSCD:6534398

Constructing a heterojunction structure is an effective approach to strengthen the processes. Here, CoMnLax-MOF/CF has been synthesized via a one-pot solvothermal pathway to integrate the charge transport advantage of the heterojunction and the mass-transfer superiority of high porosity of the metal-organic framework (MOF), wherein the heterojunction is formed by introducing La in preparing the CoMn-MOF process. The results demonstrate that the as-prepared CoMnLax-MOF/CF possesses flower-like/flower-bud microstructures with a CoMn-MOF/La-MOF heterojunction topology, resulting in superior OER performance. The enhanced OER property originates from reduced charge-transfer resistance and an enlarged activated surface area. At a molar ratio of n(La):n(Co):n(Mn) = 0.2:1:1, the CoMnLa0.2-MOF/CF presents optimal performance. In 1 M KOH, the overpotential is only 201 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) current density. There appears no significant current density degeneration in the 25 h stability test. This work demonstrates one facile pathway for directly building the heterojunction in CoMn-MOF to achieve superb OER activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000830937700001

Herein, we report a strategy to fabricate Fe-doped amorphous CoO, (a-CoyFezOx) as an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst by a facile reduction reaction at room temperature. In a 1 M KOH electrolyte, the optimized a-Co2.5Fe0.5Ox catalyst shows the best OER activity. It only requires a 280 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 39.9 mV dec(-1), which is even better than that of a commercial IrO2 catalyst. This high activity can be ascribed to the combined merits of the amorphous structure and the doped Fe element. The amorphous structure can enlarge the electrochemically accessible surface area and offer more active sites, while the Fe doped into the amorphous CoOx material can not only form the Fe site to promote the adsorption of intermediates during the OER process but also optimize the electronic structure of neighboring Co sites to enhance the OER activity. This work provides a strategy for rational design and large-scale synthesis of the transition metal oxide electrocatalysts to enhance the OER performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000813020300001

Herein, an efficient in situ etching strategy is employed to transform part of the pristine NiFe-MOF into active NiFe(OH)(x) and simultaneously induce the exposure of abundant defective areas, which not only facilitates the electron transfer efficiency for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but also enables the accessibility to further anchor Ru. Benefiting from the synergistic contributions of Ru, NiFe(OH)(x) and NiFe-MOF, the as-fabricated Ru/NiFe(OH)(x)/NiFe-MOF nanocomposite exhibits an enhanced OER activity with a low overpotential of 242 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and a two-electrode Ru/NiFe(OH)(x)/NiFe-MOF||Pt/C electrolyzer also requires a considerably low voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting. Moreover, taking both experimental and mechanistic results into account, the introduction of a small amount of Ru is able to induce a stronger adsorption between electrochemically active sites and oxygen-related intermediates, thus facilitating the OER activity.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000711115500001

Characterization data revealed that the Pd2+ precursor has been oxidized during the synthesis, and the resulting Pd4+ ions have unprecedently replaced the lattice framework Mn3+ ions of alpha-MnO2. Furthermore, formation of PdO nanoparticles was also observed. Lower OER overpotential at j = 10 mA cm(-2) (636 mV) was obtained for Pd/alpha-MnO2 in relation to alpha-MnO2 (700 mV), what is in alignment with the lower charge transfer resistance of Pd/alpha-MnO2 (4.9 k0 cm(2)) compared to alpha-MnO2 (10.4 k0 cm(2)). Lower Tafel slope (73 mV dec(-1)) and higher TOF (2.87 x 10(-4) s(-1)) at overpotential of 350 mV was obtained for Pd/alpha-MnO2 in relation to alpha-MnO2 (Tafel of 77 mV dec(-1) and TOF of 1.94 x 10(-4) s(-1)), indicating a faster electron transfer kinetics promoted by Pd. Pd/alpha-MnO2 was stable at j = 14 mA cm(-2) for 6 h. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we designed a convenient strategy to fabricate a three-dimensional self-supported S2--doped NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH)/Ni foam (NF) catalyst by a hydrothermal reaction and etching at ambient temperature. The as-obtained S2--doped NiFe-LDH/NF (NiFe-LDH/NF-S-3h) with hierarchical porous nanosheets is beneficial for providing high density of active sites and accelerating the mass transport. Remarkably, NiFe-LDH/NF-S-3h exhibits a superior activity for the OER with a very low overpotential of 239 and 309 mV to deliver current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm(-2) in alkaline medium. Additionally, NiFe-LDH/NF-S-3h also demonstrates excellent long-term stability at 500 mA cm(-2) for 150 h, showing an excellent industrial application prospect. Moreover, density functional theory calculations and X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveal that the introduction of S2- can effectively optimize the electronic structure of the cationic active site and improve the adsorption and desorption capability of oxygenated intermediates. The present work may provide a relatively convenient method for designing highly active electrocatalysts for practical applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000812970000001

Pristine Co3O4 and mixed cobalt iron oxide nanowires with a diameter of 7 nm have been synthesized via a nanocasting route by using SBA-1S silica as a template. A small amount of iron added during the synthesis results in a decrease in the nanowires' array length and induces the formation of a bimodal pore size distribution. Raman spectroscopy, X-ray emission, and high-energy resolution X-ray absorption spectroscopies further show that Fe incorporation alters the electronic structure by increasing the average distortion around the cobalt centers and the amount of Co2+ in tetrahedral sites. These affect the OER activity significantly; the overpotential of pristine Co3O4 at 10 mA/cm(2) decreases from 398 to 378 mV, and the current density at 1.7 V increases from 107 to 150 mA/cm(2) with the addition of iron at the Co/Fe atomic ratio of 32. Furthermore, post-reaction characterization confirmed that both the morphology and electronic structure of nanowires remain intact after a long-term stability test.									33	1	0	0	0	0	32			2574-0962			WOS:000576676900052

However, the high cost and low abundance limit wide application of such metals. As such, one challenging issue is the development of low-cost and high-efficiency electrocatalysts for such purposes. In this study, we synthesized Co-FeS2/CoS2 heterostructures via a hydrothermal method for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Benefitting from their unique three-dimensional hierarchical nanostructures, Co-doped FeS2, and CoS2 formed heterostructures on Co-FeS2 petals, which bestowed remarkable electrocatalytic properties upon Co-FeS2/CoS2 nanostructures. Co-FeS2/CoS2 effectively catalyzed the OER with an overpotential of 278 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution, and also is capable of driving a current density -10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of -103 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The overpotential of the OER and HER only decreased by 5 mV and 3 mV after 1000 cycles. Our Co-FeS2/CoS2 materials may offer a promising alternative to noble metal-based electrocatalysts for water splitting.									25	1	0	0	2	0	25				2046-2069		WOS:000442616800048	35542473

Herein, we demonstrate a facile method based on cation exchange reaction (CER) for preparation of NiCoFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheet arrays which directly grafted on flexible carbon fiber clothes (NiCoFe-DH/CFC) for OER application. It is found that the optimal NiCoFe-LDH/CFC with 1 h CER exhibited superior OER activity than pristine NiCo-LDH material and commercial Ir/C electrode including a low onset overpotential (eta) of only 240 mV and a low overpotential of 280 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The Tafel slope decreased from 63 mV dec(-1) for pristine NiCo-LDH material to 34 mV dec(-1) for NiCoFe-LDH/CFC with 1 h CER. At an overpotential of 0.3 V, an over 16.5 times of improvement of the turnover frequency (TOF) of NiCoFe-LDH/CFC with 1 h CER (0.0347 s(-1)) was achieved compared to NiCo-LDH (0.0021 s(-1)). The NiCoFe-LDH/CFC with 1 h CER demonstrated a retention rate of 98% after 10 h stability testing. All the results demonstrate the excellent electrocatalytic activity of NiCoFe-LDH/CFC for OER applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

When employed as a cathode for lithium-oxygen batteries, the 3D Co3O4 HPNT network demonstrated superior bifunctional electrocatalytic activities towards both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with a relatively low charge overpotential of 99 mV and a high discharge/charge capacity of 4164/4299 mA h g(-1). High-resolution scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements on Co3O4 HPNT-based cathode after discharge/recharge showed reversible formation and decomposition of Li2O2. This superior performance is ascribed to the 3D web-like porous tubular structure, which facilitates rapid oxygen flow, provides enough void volume for insoluble Li2O2 deposition, and increases the catalytic utilization of Co3O4. Moreover, the hierarchical porous structure with meso-/nanopores on the walls of the Co3O4 nanotubes facilitates O-2 diffusion, electrolyte penetration, and mass transport of all the reactants.									43	3	0	0	0	0	44			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000405689000022

However, its high cost and scarcity have hindered the commercialization of many green technologies that require the use of Pt electrocatalysts. To pave the way for mass production, the search for alternative electrocatalysts was initiated by researchers working in the fuel cell area, and it has been rapidly expanded to other energy applications in the past few years. Our discussion in this perspective starts with several reasons why Pt is the best electrocatalyst for many important electrochemical reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Along with a brief introduction of other novel metal electrocatalysts (ruthenium and iridium compounds) used for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), this perspective highlights recent advances in the development of non-Pt electrocatalysts for dye-/quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs/QDSSCs) and water-splitting systems. We identify the key materials in each area that have shown promising results for replacing Pt as an electrocatalyst and discuss their pros and cons. The possible mechanisms responsible for the observed improvements in performance are also discussed. While many materials have shown encouraging electrocatalytic activity, the long-term stability under a variety of operating conditions remains as a critical issue that must be addressed. An improved theoretical understanding is also required to accelerate the progress in this area. The main challenge is to identify the active sites and operating mechanisms in order to intelligently design and synthesize better and more cost-effective electrocatalysts.									99	3	0	0	4	0	100			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000364614600003

In this work, we report the synthesis of well-controlled vertically aligned Ni/NiO nanocomposites consisting of Ni nanoclusters embedded in NiO, which result in highly efficient electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. We show that such a high catalytic efficiency toward both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) originates from a synergetic effect at Ni/NiO interfaces that significantly reduces the energy barrier for water dissociation, and favours the formation of reactive H* intermediates on the Ni side of the interface, and OHads on the NiO side of the interface. A study of water chemisorption based on near-ambient pressure photoelectron spectroscopy indicates that the abundant hetero-interfaces in Ni/NiO nanocomposite promote the dissociation of water with a three-fold increase in the surface concentration of OHads compared with pure NiO. Density functional theory calculations indicate that Ni/NiO interface leads to the reduction of the water dissociation energy barrier due to a high concentration of oxygen vacancies at NiO side of the interface, whereas the formation of highly active metallic Ni sites with an optimal value of Gibbs free energy of H* (Delta G(H*) = -0.16 eV) owes to a favourable adjustment of the electron energetics at the interface, thus accelerating the overall electrochemical water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1674-7291	1869-1870		WOS:000855590500002

The trends in electrochemical (hollandite >> bixbyite > birnessite > hausmannite) and chemical OER (hollandite > birnessite > bixbyite > hausmannite) are different, which can be explained by differences in electric conductivity. H2O2 decomposition and chemical OER, on the other hand, showed the same trend and even a linear correlation of their initial OER rates. A linear correlation between the catalytic performance and the manganese oxidation state of the catalysts was observed. Another trend was observed related to the specific surface area, highlighting the importance of these properties for the OER. Altogether, hollandite was found to be the best performing catalyst in this study due to a combination of the high manganese oxidation state and a large specific surface area. Likely, due to a sufficient electrical conductivity, this intrinsically high OER performance is also found to some extent in electrocatalysis for this specific example.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0932-0776	1865-7117		WOS:000760976000001

Herein, significant improvement in OER performance has been achieved by using hierarchical nanostructured Ce-Co3O4 composites derived from Ce-substituted ZIF-67 precursors. Our results show that proper control of the introduced Ce amount and species could precisely tune the Co3+/Co2+ ratio and induce surface oxygen defects, further boosting the OER performance. Especially, the introduction of suitable Ce content (i.e., 6.44 wt% Ce) into the crystal structure and onto the surface of Co3O4 effectively facilitates the formation of Co3+ species and modifies the chemical binding energies, leading to much improved activity for OER with a 369 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 56 mV dec(-1) and excellent long-term stability in 1.0 M KOH solution. These results demonstrate the efficient and feasible strategy for tailoring the electrocatalytic properties of metal oxides by Ce-doping and modification.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			2398-4902			WOS:000492020200028

The sequences of the known cytochromes c(2) can be placed in two subfamilies based upon insertions and deletions, one subfamily is most like mitochondrial cytochrome c (the small C2s, without significant insertions and deletions), and the other, designated large C2, shares 3- and 8-residue insertions as well as a single-residue deletion. C2s generally function between cytochrome bc(1) and cytochrome oxidase in respiration (ca 80 examples known to date) and between cytochrome bc(1) and the reaction center in nonsulfur purple bacterial photosynthesis (ca 21 examples). However, members of the large C2 subfamily are almost always involved in photosynthesis (12 of 14 examples). In addition, the gene for the large C2 (cycA) is associated with those for the photosynthetic reaction center (pufBALM). We hypothesize that the insertions in the large C2s, which were already functioning in photosynthesis, allowed them to replace the membrane-bound tetraheme cytochrome, PufC, that otherwise mediates between the small C2 or other redox proteins and photosynthetic reaction centers. Based upon our analysis, we propose that the involvement of C2 in nonsulfur purple bacterial photosynthesis was a metabolic feature subsequent to the evolution of oxygen respiration.									4	0	0	0	3	0	12			0302-8933			WOS:000281842600008	20697695

Heterostructures of transition metal chalcogenides have emerged as important candidates for catalyzing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) or hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), due to the synergistic effects originating from the increased active sites or accelerated electron transfer. Current limitation to this strategy lies in the complication of synthesis often resorting to the direct growth of hybrid structures on a conductive current collector. Here, a simple approach is selected to synthesize graphitic carbon layer coated Ni3S2/MoS2 heterostructures (denoted as NMC) with a facile scaffold-free solvothermal method followed by controlled pyrolysis. The NMC obtained at 600 degrees C behave as durable, efficient oxygen and hydrogen evolution electrodes with overpotentials of 350 mV and 233 mV respectively at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. In addition, the catalysts demonstrate a high efficiency for overall water splitting. Such architected catalyst designs may shed light on the development of more efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			2196-0216			WOS:000501286600008

Before synthesis of the proposed catalyst, considerable oxygen evolution was observed using only plain CeO2 microspheres as the catalyst. Individual catalytic activity of plain CeO2 microspheres was explained by the formation of oxidative oxygen species due to the coexistence of Ce(III) and Ce(IV) ions on the surface as demonstrated by deconvoluted XPS analysis. Hence, CeO2 component of IrO2@CeO2 microspheres acted either support or active center. In other words, another active center, IrO2 NPs, was immobilized on the satisfactorily high surface area of porous CeO2 microspheres acted a support. IrO2@CeO2 microspheres with double catalytic active centers exhibited superior catalytic activity with respect to IrO2 NP decorated-porous SiO2 (IrO2@SiO2) microspheres due to the contribution coming from CeO2 microspheres. The maximum turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) were obtained as 483 and 724 h(-1) using CAN. By using IrO2@CeO2 microspheres as the catalyst, no significant decrease occurred in the oxygen evolution in the repeated runs with NaIO4 as the oxidant while the oxygen evolution apparently decreased using CAN.Y									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000631570800001

The modification of natural coal by heteroatoms such as N and S, or metal oxide species, has been demonstrated to form very promising electrocatalysts for the ORR and OER. However, it remains elusive and underexplored as to how the impurity elements in coal may impact the electrocatalytic properties of coal-derived catalysts. Herein, we explore the influence of the presence of various trace metals that are notable impurities in coal, including Al, Si, Ca, K, Fe, Mg, Co, Mn, Ni, and Cu, on the electrochemical performance of the prepared catalysts. The constructed Zn-air batteries are further shown to be able to power green LED lights for more than 80 h. The charge-discharge polarization curves exhibited excellent and durable rechargeability over 500 (ca. 84 h) continuous cycles. The promotional effect of the trace elements is believed to accrue from a combination of electronic structure modification of the active sites, enhancement of the active site density, and formation of a conductive 3-dimensional hierarchical network of carbon nanotubes.									13	2	0	0	1	0	13			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000534337900026	32319453

Herein, we achieved these criteria in both an oxygen-evolving n-Si photoanode and hydrogen-evolving p-Si photocathode by simple electrodeposition of a nanocrystalline thin film of Ru. The bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of the nanocrystalline Ru led to low overpotentials in both the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (0.27 V) and alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (0.04 V). In addition, the nanocrystalline Ru/Si junctions influenced the interface energetics via the induction of an extrinsic electrochemical potential on the surface of the Ru nanocrystals through a redox reaction rather than the chemical potential of the electrons (work function) of bulk Ru. The nanocrystalline Ru film exhibited bipolar applicability, enabling both Ru/n-Si and Ru/p-Si junctions with high V-oc values of 0.63 and 0.5 V, respectively. As a result, the n-Si photoanode in the acidic electrolyte and the p-Si photocathode in the alkaline electrolyte generated a photocurrent of 10 mA/cm(2) at record values of 0.87 and 0.42 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively. These results provide insight into the development of high-performance PEC cells based on a nanocrystalline electrocatalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000526583500043	32183516

Herein, efficient OER electrocatalysts based on iron hydroxide-modified nickel hydroxylphosphate (NiPO/Fe(OH)(x)) single-wall nanotubes (SWNTs) have been prepared by a facile stepwise surfactant-free solvothermal strategy, which possess diameters of about 6 nm and lengths of about several micrometers. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between iron hydroxides and NiPO SWNTs, the as-prepared NiPO/Fe(OH)(x) SWNTs exhibit higher OER activity than primary NiPO SWNTs. Furthermore, the OER activity with different Fe contents displays a volcano-type shape, and the optimized NiPO/Fe(OH) SWNTs present excellent activity with a low overpotential of 248 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and 323 mV to achieve a large current density of 100 mA cm(-2), as well as a remarkably low Tafel slope of 45.4 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH electrolyte.

In this study, we synthesized spindle-shaped ferric oxyhydroxide nanoparticles directly grown on carbon cloth (spindle-FON/CC) by a facile and straightforward hydrolysis method. This material is a promising candidate for the fabrication of efficient electrodes used in supercapacitors (SCs) and electrocatalytic cells for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The as-prepared spindle-FON/CC exhibits unique structural features with nano-sized grains and pores that provide large electrolyte contact areas (electrochemically active sites) and favorable ion diffusion pathways. These structural properties lead to efficient capacitive behavior and electrochemical catalytic activity. The as-prepared spindle-FON/CC electrode showed a high specific capacitance of 612.5 mF cm(-2) and outstanding cycling stability (95.7 % capacitance retention after 4,000 cycles). When used as an OER electrocatalyst, the spindle-FON/CC exhibited improved electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 216 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 73.4 mV dec(-1).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000736646500002

However, the competition between the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and chlorine evolution reaction (CER) at the anode with sluggish kinetics is the main bottleneck. Herein, an organic-oxidation-assisted strategy has been demonstrated, in which the thermodynamically favorable methanol selective oxidation reaction (MSOR) is used to suppress the undesired OER/CER using carbon paper supported Pt-Co3O4 electrocatalysts (denoted as Pt-Co3O4/CP), leading to hydrogen and value-added formate generation simultaneously with significantly low energy consumption. In the integrated two-electrode electrolyzer using Pt-Co3O4/CP bifunctional electrocatalysts, the required cell voltage at 10 mA cm(-2) is only 0.555 V when adding 2.0 M methanol, which is 1022 mV lower than that in alkaline seawater. The integrated cell also produces hydrogen and formate simultaneously with high faradaic efficiency and considerable durability. The findings in this work represent a new direction for energy-saving production of hydrogen from seawater.									21	3	0	0	1	0	21			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000631985900032

Herein, in the light of the first-principles methods, a series of new OER electrocatalysts (Fe-, Co-and Ni-WSSe) are designed with single Fe, Co and Ni atoms embedded in Janus WSSe monolayer (ML) with S or Se vacancy. It indicates that the single Fe, Co and Ni atoms can stably embed Janus WSSe ML with S/Se vacancy and prominently modify the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of the systems. From the calculated Gibbs free energies, Ni-WSSe presents the prominent OER catalytic activity among the pristine Janus WSSe ML and Fe-, Co-and Ni-WSSe systems due to its minimum overpotential of 0.53 V. The high OER catalytic activity of Ni-WSSe stems mainly from the synergistic effect of the Ni atom and the Janus WSSe ML. Present findings suggest that embedding appropriate single transition-metal (TM) atoms is an effective strategy to boost the catalytic activity of Janus WSSe ML for OER, which would facilitate the development of the cost-effective OER electrocatalysts for clean energy conversion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2468-8231			WOS:000861310400007

However, the exact role played by the non-metals and metalloids in promoting the OER is not well understood. A holistic understanding of the origin of the OER activity enhancement in these compounds is vital for their exploitation as models to inspire knowledge-guided design of improved OER catalysts. In this review, we elucidate the factors that govern the activity and stability of OER catalysts derived from MX compounds (M=Co or Ni, and X=nonmetal or metalloid), including the impact of surface electronic structure, M : X stoichiometry, material composition, structure and crystallinity, as well as the role of oxoanions on the properties of the electrochemical double layer and interaction energies of the reaction intermediates. Finally, we outline a few perspectives and research directions towards a deeper understanding of the role of the nonmetal and metalloid elements and design of improved OER catalysts.									53	3	0	0	1	0	53			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000485100600001

Herein, encouraged by the structural characteristic of layered double hydroxide (LDH), CoCr LDH was proposed, for the first time, to verify the photoelectric synergy towards catalyzing OER. Under AM 1.5 irradiation, the optimal CoCr LDH presents a 1.35 similar to 1.5-fold enhanced OER intrinsic activity and a faster charge transfer, thus achieving a decreased overpotential of 28 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. Meanwhile, the H-2 amount produced at the cathode also increases 1.8 times. The synergistic enhancement in the highly active Co3+ sites and the charge transfer, both triggered by the photo-generated carriers on CoCr LDH, is mainly responsible for such a remarkably improved activity. This proof-of-concept study provides a reasonable and scalable platform towards engineering the self-consistent catalysts for the photoelectric synergy system.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000623587800002

The formed cobalt nanoparticles are impregnated in the porous carbon matrix with an intermediary layer of catalytically active Co2N. Co@NC exhibits a specific surface area of 2513 m(2) g(-1) and remarkable bifunctional catalytic activities with a low gap of 0.76 V between ORR and OER overpotentials.

Metal-free carbon-based electrocatalysts attract much attention due to their rich resource and low expenditure, but their practical application still remains as a huge challenge. In this work, flexible self-supporting metal-free N-doped graphene (NG) membrane is prepared by a blade coating assisted hydrothermal method. The morphology, structure and other physicochemical properties of this NG membrane are systematically characterized and analyzed. The results reveal that the resultant NG membrane shows unique flexible self-supporting architecture and achieves successful N doping, which guarantees excellent flexibility and tensile strength, and strengthens the intrinsic catalytic activity, electrical conductivity and hydrophilicity of NG membrane. As a consequence, when directly used as the OER electrocatalyst, the obtained NG membrane displays much promoted catalytic activity and stability, which is comparable or even superior to those previously reported metal-free electrocatalysts for OER. Obviously, this work provides a good guidance on developing low-cost and high-performance metal-free electrocatalysts for energy-related electrocatalytic reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000852049000001

Numerous past and ongoing R&D activities have sought to reduce their dependence on precious metal catalysts, but unfortunately, there has still been no breakthrough in electrocatalyst design for PEM water electrolyzers. Scarce iridium remains the best choice as an electrocatalyst, thanks to its efficiency and durability for hosting the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, we present a synthesis method for preparing an iridium nanostructure that utilizes it more efficiently. A highly uniform morphology of IrO2 nanospheres was achieved based on a cation-exchange reaction and using a sacrificial template. This highly simple synthesis enabled a high concentration of hydroxide groups on the surface without additional treatment to be achieved, which plays a significant role in enhancing OER, as electrocatalysts present a 3-fold increase in mass activity compared to commercial IrO2. This study provides insights into the synthesis of nanostructures, with much potential to apply these to different applications. Moreover, we draw attention to the fundamental importance of structural properties with this simple but uniform structure and its performance as an electrocatalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2574-0970		WOS:000800286500093

The design and synthesis of robust and low-cost OER catalysts are crucial for the OER. NiCo-based electrocatalysts have suitable atomic and electronic structures, and show high activity and stability during the OER process. Recently, significant progress has been made in regulating the structure and composition of NiCo-based catalysts and understanding the nature of catalysis, especially the OER mechanism, catalytic active sites, and structure-activity relationship. In this work, we summarized and discussed the latest development of NiCo-based electrocatalysts in the OER, with particular emphasis on catalyst design and synthesis, strategies for boosting OER performance, and understanding the nature of catalysis from experimental and theoretical perspectives. The OER mechanism, some activity descriptors, and atomic and electronic structure-activity relationships based on NiCo-based electrocatalysts are unveiled. Finally, some challenges and futuristic outlooks for improving the performance of NiCo-based electrocatalysts are proposed, and we hope this review can provide guidance for the design of more efficient NiCo-based electrocatalysts.									50	0	0	0	2	0	49			2155-5435			WOS:000709692900008

Thus, electrolysis of solutions containing a high concentration of chlorides yields preferentially chlorine. In this study, a thin film consisting of oxygen-deficient and disordered manganese oxide nanolayers on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrode exhibited a high selectivity for OER over CER in 0.5 M NaCl solution. The catalyst was fabricated by electrodeposition of layered manganese dioxide intercalated with Na+ ions (Na vertical bar MnO2) followed by heat treatment above 300 degrees C in air. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that, at 200 degrees C, oxygen vacancies started to form, accompanied by a decrease in the valence state of Mn in the oxide. The X-ray diffraction and absorption fine structure data revealed that, above 300 degrees C, the multilayered structure of Na vertical bar MnO2 that had been constructed during electrodeposition was disordered to yield " oxygen-deficient" MnOx nanolayers, which could lead to an increase in catalytic activity and selectivity for OER. The Na vertical bar MnOx film heat-treated at 400 degrees C showed a Faradaic efficiency as high as 87% in galvanostatic electrolysis at 10 mA cm(-2). The Mg2+-intercalated MnO2 electrodeposited similarly did not lose its multi-layered structure and did not show a decrease in the Mn valence state during heat treatment, and its activity and selectivity for OER were much inferior to those obtained with Na+.									16	1	0	0	0	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000661125100006

The optimized sample of S-CoMn2O4 shows overpotentials shifts of 60 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 40 mV for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results reveal that the S-doping can significantly increase highly active Mn4+, Co3+, and oxygen defects, while density functional calculation results suggest that metal-oxygen covalency of S-CoMn2O4 can enhance the shrinking energy difference of Co 3d-O 2p and Mn 3d-O 2p centers, which can explain the enhancement of OER/ORR activities. What's more, the S-CoMn2O4 based zinc-air battery displays excellent open voltage of 1.52 V, power density of 108.3 mW cm(-2), specific capacity of 808.2 mA h g(-1) at 10 mA cm(-2), and good cycling stability.

A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) was used to detect which products are formed during reduction and to evaluate the reversibility of the reactions. The studied parameters include the scan rate and the applied cathodic potential. We confirm by the QCM that LiO2 is soluble: this conclusion comes from the time delay we observed between the deposition of the expected mass (based on Faraday's law) and the measured mass. Ambiguity in reported literature values for the slope of the deposited mass per electron M/z is due to the negligence in considering this time delay. The average M/z value versus cathodic charge indicates that soluble LiO2 is the first product of the ORR which reacts further to form Li2O2, either via a disproportionation reaction or via further electrochemical reduction of LiO2. For strong negative potentials and thus large depths of discharge, Li2O is the main discharge product. The reaction pathways hence strongly depend on the experimental conditions applied; especially the reduction potential. The redox mediator tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) was investigated and its influence on reversibility was confirmed by cycling at moderate depths of discharge, where Li2O2 is the main discharge product.									42	1	0	0	6	0	43			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000354195300019	25898788

Furthermore, Ni3S2@FeNi-NiFe2O4/C-3 composite shows good stability in alkaline media. The outstanding electrocatalytic OER performance of composites was attributed due to the synergetic effect between Ni(3)S(2 )nanostrips and FeNi-NiFe(2)O(4 )nanoparticles and it is believed that the heterointerfaces between them act as active centers for OER. Additionally, N-doped carbon prevents the aggregation of Ni3S2@FeNi-NiFe(2)O(4 )species and enhances the conductivity of composites during the OER process.(C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

In this work, a simple oxidation-coordination method was developed for scalable synthesis of a FeCoNi nanoparticles-modified nitrogen-doped carbon hybrid (designated as O-FeCo40Ni10-C) with lignin as carbon precursor for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Specifically, a Fenton reaction-driven pre-oxidation process changed the molecular structure of alkali lignin and increased functional groups, which contributes to the efficient incorporation of metal active sites into lignin-derived carbon materials. Benefiting from abundant active sites, the synergistic effect of CoFe/NiFe compositions and interconnected porous structure, the obtained O-FeCo40Ni10-C exhibited a high OER activity. It only required an overpotential of 280 mV to drive current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution. Moreover, the turnover frequency of O-FeCo40Ni10-C was 0.030 and 0.185 s(-1) at the overpotential of 300 and 400 mV, respectively. This work provided an environmentally-friendly strategy to synthesize lignin-derived catalyst for OER and expanded the application of lignin in energy conversion filed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000824737100005

In the present study, we investigated the catalytic activity of a series mono-atomic transition-metal atoms supported by MXenes M(2)NO(2)for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via first principle calculation. Particularly, single atom Cu site on Ti(2)NO(2)having the lowest overpotentials of 0.24 V and bonding with the reaction intermediates moderately, is the most active SAC for OER. Energetically, Cu atom prefers to be mono-atomically anchored on Ti(2)NO(2)instead of aggregating. Plus, Cu anchoring enhance the electronic states around Fermi level. Additionally,ab-initiomolecular dynamics simulations show that Cu atom is anchored on Ti2NO2, stable and isolatable at 300 K. Studies on the small molecule adsorption on Cu-Ti(2)NO(2)further prove the potential applications of Cu-Ti(2)NO(2)as active SACs for OER. Our results broaden the perception of MXenes and guide the exploration of non-noble metal based OER electrocatalysts.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000541551900001

Research on earth abundant, efficient, and stable OER electrocatalysts is a key factor for the technological improvement of water-splitting systems. In this article, we demonstrate OER performance of olivine-type lithium earth-abundant transition-metal phosphates coated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO). We report on LiCoPO4/rGO and the solid solutions Li1-xCoyFe1-yPO4/rGO synthesized by a nonaqueous sol-gel microwave reaction. Interestingly, such conditions allow for the direct synthesis of substochiometric Li0.7Co0.75Fe0.25PO4/rGO compound with improved OER activity. The materials crystallize in the olivine orthorhombic phase with nanoplatelet-like shape with nanometer-size thickness and micrometer-size width. The substochiometric phase Li0.7Co0.75Fe0.25PO4/rGO exhibits the best OER activity in alkaline medium, generating a current density of 5 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 0.39 V and a Tafel slope of 44.5 mV dec(-1) in 6 M KOH with a low 51 jig cm(-2) loading, outperforming previously reported results in terms of mass effectivity and Tafel slope.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2155-5435			WOS:000444364800103

Herein, a series of LaNiO3 compounds with different Sn-cation substitutions in the A-site was fabricated and exhibited observable electrocatalytic activity toward the OER. The compositions and structures of the perovskite oxides were systematically investigated via powder X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and found to be hexagonal with the space group R3c(167). The optimized La0.9Sn0.1NiO3-delta catalyst exhibits favorable stability in alkaline electrolyte and enhanced electrocatalytic activity with an overpotential of 318 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER, which is reduced by 131 mV compared with that of pristine LaNiO3 (449 mV). Transient photovoltage (TPV) tests confirm the faster interface charge transfer upon Sn substitution. Density function theory (DFT) calculations verify that Sn substitution efficiently enhances the Ni 3d-O 2p covalency and tailors both surface lattice oxygens, boosting the OER performance. This work provides a promising way to design and fabricate a perovskite oxide electrocatalyst for the OER.									3	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000738143700001

Designing the neighboring geometry of single-atom catalysts can tailor the adsorption configuration of reaction intermediates and enhance their activity in catalytic reactions. In this work, we proposed a neighboring cationic vacancy strategy in single-atom Ru catalysts to adjust the adsorption configuration of reaction intermediates for improved oxygen evolution performance. An Ru single-atom catalyst with neighboring Co2+ vacancies (Ru1/VCo-Co(OH)2) showed better OER performance than a catalyst without Co2+ vacancies (Ru1/Co(OH)2). The mass activity of Ru1/VCo-Co(OH)2 was calculated to be 6688 A g-1 at 300 mV overpotential, which was 4.73 times higher than that of Ru1/Co(OH)2. Particularly, the mass activity of Ru1/VCo-Co(OH)2 was notably 481.15 times higher than that of commercial RuO2. Both in situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopy measurements and DFT calculations manifested that the existence of neighboring Co2+ vacancies modulated the adsorption configuration of *OOH intermediates on atomic Ru sites by hydrogen bonding, which reduced the energy barrier of rate determining steps and improved the OER activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000864723800001

To better understand how its activity can be modulated through electrolyte effects in the double layer microenvironment, herein we investigate the effects of different acid anions on platinum for the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) and hydrogen evolution/oxidation reaction (HER/HOR) in pH 1 electrolytes. Experimentally, we see the ORR activity trend of HClO4 > HNO3 > H2SO4, and the OER activity trend of HClO4 > HNO3 similar to H2SO4. HER/HOR performance is similar across all three electrolytes. Notably, we demonstrate that ORR performance can be improved 4-fold in nitric acid compared to in sulfuric acid. Assessing the potential-dependent role of relative anion competitive adsorption with density functional theory, we calculate unfavorable adsorption on Pt(111) for all the anions at HER/HOR conditions while under ORR/OER conditions ClO4- binds the weakest followed by NO3- and SO42-. Our combined experimental-theoretical work highlights the importance of understanding the role of anions across a large potential range and reveals nitrate-like electrolyte microenvironments as interesting possible sulfonate alternatives to mitigate the catalyst poisoning effects of polymer membranes/ionomers in electrochemical systems. These findings help inform rational design approaches to further enhance catalyst activity via microenvironment engineering.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2399-3669			WOS:000757832500001

In this work, we introduce a general dealloying procedure to synthesize a series of predesigned rugged high-entropy alloy (HEA) nanowires, including Al-Ni-Co-Ru-X, where X = Mo, Cu, V, Fe as the trifunctional electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). These mechanically and chemically stable HEAs can not only significantly reduce the noble-metal contents but also effectively enhance the flexibility in their electronic structures suitable for broad catalytic functionalities. Specifically, our etched Al-Ni-Co-Ru-Mo nanowires exhibit a similarly high electrocatalytic activity as commercial Pt/C for HER. Its OER activity is much higher than the commercial RuO2 and among the highest ever-reported Ru-based OER catalysts. Its ORR catalytic activity is even higher than Pt/C, although Ru is not considered as a good ORR catalyst. Moreover, the oxidized surfaces of these HEAs are highly stable during continuous working conditions, which is crucial for overall water splitting and rechargeable Zn-air batteries.									39	3	0	0	1	0	39				2639-4979		WOS:000599198900017

The composition of the synthesized composites were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray-photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Their electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution in PEM water electrolysis was investigated using the common electrochemical techniques of cyclic voltammetry and steady state polarisation. The XRD spectra registered a formation of solid solution between the metallic components accompanied by decrease in the lattice parameter and the crystal size. The effects observed resulted in enhanced efficiency toward oxygen evolution reaction of the synthesized Pt-Fe/Ebonex and Pt-Co/Ebonex catalysts compared to pure Pt.

However, wide distribution of the Fe source around the globe and inexpensiveness compared to other transition metals (Ni, Co, etc.) make their development a priority in electrocatalysis research. Herein, we report the synthesis of a Fe-rich OER electrocatalyst (Ni0.06Fe0.94OOH) that operates at significantly higher efficiency compared to Ni-rich materials. A controlled synthesis using polyethylenimine as a capping agent was adapted, which rendered FeOOH nanorods with excellent colloidal stability. Incorporation of a minuscule amount (6%) of Ni(II) in the material resulted in the dramatic enhancement of geometric OER activity compared to Ni-rich phases. The Ni0.06Fe0.94OOH catalyst possesses a low overpotential of 287 +/- 9 mV compared to FeOOH, which required 495 +/- 8 mV to reach the benchmark current density of 10 mA/cm(2). The catalyst displayed a low Tafel slope of 69 mV/dec and high selectivity with a Faradaic efficiency of 92%. The catalyst was stable for 2000 cycles of CV performed at a scan rate 10 mV/s, and a steady potential response was generated for 24 h at a 100 mA/cm(2) current density.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000757906500001

However, new, scalable and more efficient synthetic methods to inexpensive OER electrocatalysts are currently needed in order to develop water electrolyzers and carbon dioxide reduction cells on large scale. To this end, we here report efficient freestanding FeNi-based electrocatalysts for OER derived from iron, one of the most Earth-abundant metals, by a facile potential cycling synthetic method in an aqueous NiSO4 solution. The optimized catalyst requires a low overpotential of 236 mV to catalyze OER with a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) in 1.0 M KOH solution. More importantly, this free-standing water-oxidation electrode can maintain a current density of 100 mA/cm(2) for more than 72 h. During the course of the electrochemical activation, both cathodic reduction and anodic oxidation are found to play important roles in the surface reconstruction of metallic iron into electrocatalytically active FeNi-based bimetallic hydroxide nanosheet arrays for OER electrocatalysts. This inexpensively fabricated OER electrode prepared from iron has a great potential to reduce the overall cost of water electrolyzers and other related renewable energy systems.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2168-0485			WOS:000584349900014

In general, partial cobalt substitution resulted in an improved electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with NiCo2O4 demonstrating superior performance among the catalysts prepared.

In this study, we report a one dimensional N-doped carbon nanostructure, containing Mo2C and Co nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped graphene layers (Mo2C@NC/Co@NG) as a multi-functional electrocatalyst. The optimized Mo2C@NC/Co@NG exhibited high activities and stabilities towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The experimental results demonstrate that the high activities and stabilities of the multi-functional catalysts are ascribed to the synergistic effect between Mo2C, Co, and N dopants. Typically, the optimized Mo2C@NC/Co@NG catalyst delivered a HER current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of 142 mV. Furthermore, a rechargeable zinc-air battery with the optimized Mo2C@NC/Co@NG as OER and ORR bifunctional catalyst showed a high round-trip efficiency and robust cycling stability, superior to the battery assembled with the benchmarked mixture of Pt/C and IrO2 as the air electrode.

Transition metal nitrides and oxynitrides are of particular interest in energy conversion and storage technologies due to its unique properties like metallic conductivity, wettability, durability, and chemical stability. However, chromium oxynitride is less explored as a catalyst for OER. In this work, we report chromium oxynitride (CrON) nanoparticles with spherical morphology, which are tested for electrocatalytic OER activity for the first time. The study is also conducted with its corresponding nitride (chromium nitride (CrN)) and oxide phase (chromium oxide (Cr2O3)) to benchmark the OER performance of the oxynitride. CrON nanoparticles show superior OER electrocatalytic properties over its corresponding nitride (CrN) and oxide (Cr2O3) material. CrON nanoparticles exhibit an overpotential of 409 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), with a Tafel slope of 157 mV dec(-1), and offers good stability for over 12h in alkaline medium.

In the present investigation, Co-Fe-Ga-Ni-Zn (CFGNZ) high entropy alloy (HEA) has been utilized as a low-cost electrocatalyst for OER. Herein, after cyclic voltammetry activation, CFGNZ-nanoparticles (NPs) are covered with oxidized surface and form high entropy (oxy) hydroxides (HE0s), exhibiting a low overpotential of 370 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) with a small Tafel slope of 71 mV/dec. CFGNZ alloy has higher electrochemical stability in comparison to state-of-the art RuO2 electrocatalyst as no degradation has been observed up to 10 h of chronoamperometry. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies after 10 h of long-term chronoamperometry test showed no change in the crystal structure, which confirmed the high stability of CFGNZ. The density functional theory (DFT) based calculations show that the closeness of d(p)-band centers to the Fermi level (E-F) plays a major role in determining active sites.This work highlights the tremendous potential of CFGNZ HEA for OER, which is the primary reaction involved in water splitting.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000694799000001

In particular, strain engineering has been demonstrated as a powerful strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of catalysts; however, the required complex catalyst preparation process restricts the implementation of strain engineering. Herein, we report a simple self-template method to prepare hierarchical porous Co3O4 nanowires (PNWs) with tunable compressive strain via thermal-oxidation-transformation of easily prepared oxalic acid-cobalt nitrate (Co(NO3)(2)) composite nanowires. Based on the complementary theoretical and experimental studies, the selection of proper solvents in the catalyst preparation is not only vital for the hierarchical structural evolution of Co3O4 but also for regulating their compressive surface strain. Because of the rich surface active sites and optimized electronic Co d band centers, the PNWs exhibit the excellent activity and stability for oxygen evolution reaction, delivering a low overpotential of 319 mV at 10 mA center dot cm(-2) in 1 M KOH with a mass loading 0.553 mg center dot cm(-2), which is even better than the noble metal catalyst of RuO2. This work provides a cost-effective example of porous Co3O4 nanowire preparation as well as a promising method for modification of surface strain for the enhanced electrochemical performance.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000559945800001

Mixed metal oxides containing Co, Fe or Ni have proved to be the most promising OER electrocatalysts in alkaline media. However, the active sites and reaction mechanisms of these catalysts are difficult to study due to their heterogeneous nature. Here we describe a general synthesis of Co-, Fe- and Ni-containing double-atom catalysts from their single-atom precursors via in situ electrochemical transformation. Characterization reveals molecule-like bimetallic active sites for these supported catalysts. For each catalyst, we propose a catalytic cycle; all exhibit bimetallic cooperation and follow a similar O-O bond-forming step. However, the mechanisms diverge in the site and source of OH- for O-O bond formation, as well as the order of proton and electron transfer. Our work demonstrates double-atom catalysts as an attractive platform for fundamental studies of heterogeneous OER electrocatalysts.Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts often comprise multiple metal ions in various configurations, hampering mechanistic understanding of how catalysis proceeds. Now, researchers prepare a series of double-atom OER catalysts based on Ni, Fe and Co, which act as molecular-like models and are more amenable to mechanistic study.									28	0	0	0	3	0	28			2058-7546			WOS:000713552900002

The alpha-Fe2O3-NiO/CNT catalyst exhibited fast electron transfer and high electrical conductivity due to CNT that acted as a conducting network or bridge between the agglomerates alpha-Fe2O3 and NiO nanoparticles in the composite. It demonstrated outstanding OER catalytic activity and fast reaction kinetics due to the synergistic effect of one component serving as a high electrical conducting network and other providing electrocatalytic properties, which leads to low overpotential of 130 mV (1.36 V vs RHE) and low Tafel slope (60 mVdec(-1)), considerably lower than that of commercial IrO2, that demonstrated the overpotential of 340 mV (1.57 V vs RHE) with Tafel slope of 69 mVdec(-1). Moreover, it exhibited remarkable stability and durability of 96% and retained 97% of its initial catalytic activity after 24 h at constant potential (1.36 V) and current density (10 mA cm(-2)). Thus, the alpha-Fe2O3-NiO/CNT catalyst can replace expensive noble metals as highly efficient OER electrocatalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000705723800005

Ca2Fe1.9M0.1O5(M = Mn, Co, Ni, and Cu) is synthesised and structurally characterised by powder XRD and Rietveld refinement. Valence states of the surface B site ions are identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Bifunctional oxygen electrochemistry is studied with the RDE and RRDE techniques and correlated with the structural and electronic parameters like oxygen non-stoichiometry and B site catalytic activity. Since the widely accepted electronic descriptors like e(g)filling may not be sufficient for explaining the bifunctional activity, B site electron donating capability as well as the extent of oxygen vacancies enhancing O(2)adsorption is also considered. Such structural parameters are also found to influence both the ORR and OER and based on this, Ni doping is proposed as advantageous for the bifunctional activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000549894000034	32608418

For this, acidic water electrolysis with a higher current density operation and energy conversion efficiency compared with alkaline water electrolysis has attracted much attention. The four-electron-transfer oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits the overall efficiency of water electrolysis devices. In recent years, low-dimensional OER catalysts have been extensively explored to increase the overall efficiency of such devices, but most of them work well only at low current density and show unsatisfied long-term stability. In this review, recent progress in acidic OER is discussed and three aspects including intrinsic activity, high current density operation, and long-term stability are focused upon. Strategies to improve these aspects including surface chemistry engineering, constructing porous structure, and protecting the active sites' are comprehensively reviewed. Finally, prospects for developing high-performance catalysts with high current density operation and long-term stability for industrial applications are proposed.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000774640400001

In this work, SR is used to guide the design of new oxide perovskite catalysts with improved oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities. A simple descriptor, mu /t, where mu and t are the octahedral and tolerance factors, respectively, is identified, which accelerates the discovery of a series of new oxide perovskite catalysts with improved OER activity. We successfully synthesise five new oxide perovskites and characterise their OER activities. Remarkably, four of them, Cs0.4La0.6Mn0.25Co0.75O3, Cs0.3La0.7NiO3, SrNi0.75Co0.25O3, and Sr0.25Ba0.75NiO3, are among the oxide perovskite catalysts with the highest intrinsic activities. Our results demonstrate the potential of SR for accelerating the data-driven design and discovery of new materials with improved properties. Symbolic regression holds big promise for guiding materials design, yet its application in materials science is still limited. Here the authors use symbolic regression to introduce an activity descriptor predicting new oxide perovskites with improved oxygen evolution activity as corroborated by experimental validation.									82	10	0	0	3	0	84				2041-1723		WOS:000550062200009	32665539

Herein, cobalt-doped Ni3S2 nanosheets constructed flower-like architecture is grown on nickel foam (Co-Ni3S2/NF) toward OER application. It is found that, heteroatom doping induces positive effects for OER, including the modulated electronic structure, more active sites, and accelerated charge transfer. Nanosheets structure assures exposed active sites and shortened charge transfer path. Benefited from the aforementioned advantages, the as-prepared sample exhibits impressive catalysis performances, such as ultralow overpotential of 160 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1), and high stability, which behaves as the promising catalyst for OER.

Here, we systematically investigate the physical properties, structural stability, and ORR-OER bifunctional catalytic activity of Pt supported by a series of MXene substrates using density-functional-theory calculations. Our results indicate that Pt atoms disperse uniformly on the MXene supports with high structural stability at high temperature and oxidation conditions, because of the strong metal-support interaction. The lattice parameter of MXenes is found to play a crucial role in determining the morphology and stability of these heterostructures and a descriptor is proposed for their design. In particular, Pt/V2C is identified as the stable and most promising bifunctional catalyst with an overpotential comparable to the benchmarks. This work brings up a strategy for the search and design of superb transition metal/MXene catalysts for energy applications.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2331-7019			WOS:000646565800003

The development of green, high-efficiency, long-lasting and low-cost dual function electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is essential for electrocatalytic total water splitting. In this work, oxygen vacancy-enriched Fe2O3@NiO heterojunctions as bifunctional electrocatalysts are prepared through a facile one-step hydrothermal method followed by a calcination process. The synergistic effect of Fe2O3 and NiO, as well as the rich oxygen vacancies in Fe2O3, optimize their electronic structures, leading to an enhanced charge transfer rate and improved catalytic ability. Therefore, in both OER and HER processes, overpotentials needed for the Fe2O3@NiO catalyst to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) under alkaline conditions are 224 mV and 187 mV, respectively. Furthermore, the catalyst showed excellent dynamic characteristics and durability. This research provides a new strategy for regulating the electronic structure of bifunctional catalysts by heterostructures and oxygen vacancies, thereby promoting the performance of total water splitting.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				1466-8033		WOS:000723807400001

The defect engineering on nanoparticle at the atomic level can efficiently tune the electronic behavior, which offers great opportunities in enhancing the catalytic performance. In this paper, we optimized the surface oxygen vacancy concentration and created the lattice distortion in rare-earth-based perovskite oxide through gradient replacement of the B site with valence alternated element. The dual defects make the electron spin state transit from low spin state to high spin state, thus decreasing the charge transport resistance. Furthermore, assembly the modified nanoparticle subunits into the micro-sized hollow multishelled structures can provide porous shells, abundant interior space and effective contact, which enables an enhanced mass transfer and a shorter charge transport path. As a result, the systemic design in the electronic and nano-micro structures for catalyst has brought an excellent oxygen evolution performance.									48	7	0	0	3	0	50			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000552352400001	32583547

However, only very few reports are available for the metal-free electrocatalysis over COFs. Herein, we developed a new thiadiazole-based COF, C4-SHz COF, through the reaction between 1,3,5-tris(4-formylphenyl)benzene and 2,5-dihydrazinyl- 1,3,4-thiadiazole that possesses a very high specific surface area of 1224 m(2) g(-1), unique molecular architecture, high porosity, and abundant active sites. The synthesized C4-SHz COF displayed superior electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and excellent long-term durability. The electrocatalytic performance of the C4-SHz COF achieved a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of 320 mV. The higher activity of the C4-SHz COF could be attributed to the high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area, porosity, and network structure of the pi-conjugated organic building blocks, which allowed fast charge and mass transport processes. This work validates the promising potential of a metal-free COF electrocatalyst toward the OER and its capability to replace carbon-based electrocatalysts.									68	3	0	0	3	0	70			2155-5435			WOS:000535291500025

Two processes are observed inhibition of photochemical activity of both photosystems and photobleaching of pigments. Oxygen evolving complex, located at the oxidizing side of Photosystem II, is the most sensitive component of photosynthetic apparatus to environmental stress factors. In the present work the effect of high light treatment at room and low temperatures on kinetic parameters of flash oxygen yields and oxygen evolution were studied. Isolated thylakoid membranes were subjected to high light illumination for different periods of time at room (22 degrees C) and low (4 degrees C) temperature. Flash oxygen yields were determined using fast oxygen rate electrode. Photochemical activity of photosystem II was measured by Clark oxygen electrode using artificial electron acceptor. Data presented show that the damaging effect of high light treatment on oxygen evolution is lower at 4 degrees C than at 22 degrees C. When high light treatment was carried out in the presence of histidine and DMSO - scavengers of oxygen radicals, the inhibition process was retarded. Data are discussed in terms of different production rate and mobility of oxygen radicals at room and low temperature.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1310-2818	1314-3530		WOS:000451691400125

Although many OER electrocatalysts have been studied to surmount this difficult problem, the development of a highly active, inexpensive and sustained OER electrocatalyst is still a great challenge. In this study, we report a novel, cost-effective cobalt selenide (coral-like CoSe) electrocatalyst with high current density (similar to 97.5 mA cm(-2) at 1.606 V vs. RHE) and strong durability in alkaline media. The chronoamperometric response of coral-like CoSe electrocatalyst can remain 98% of its initial current density after 10000 s at the overpotential of 350 mV in 1 M KOH. The prepared coral-like CoSe electrode exhibits a low overpotential of 295 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 40 mV dec(-1), which exceeds previously reported state-of-art RuO2 electrocatalyst and is much better than CoSe nanoparticles (CoSe NPs) and precursor Co(OH)(2) electrocatalysts. This work affords us a 3D Co-based electrocatalyst with high performance and strong durability under alkaline conditions, which can be applied to energy conversion and storage processes.

Here, we report a cobalt oxide/N-doped porous carbon (Co3O4/NPC) in-situ synthesized as bifunctional catalyst through hydrothermal-calcination method using glucose and urea as precursor. Benefiting from the rich oxygen-containing functional groups of glucose and the low decomposition temperature of polymerization products from urea, the obtained catalyst exhibits a hierarchically porous structure with rich oxygen vacancy under the annealing temperature as high as 800 degrees C. Moreover, the strongly enhanced interaction between Co3O4 and NPC derived from the in-situ synthesized method is also beneficial for the adsorption of reaction intermediates and the electron transfer capability from catalyst to adsorption oxygen, enhancing the oxygen electrode reaction activity of ctalyst. Therefore, the achieved Co3O4/NPC exhibits a superior bifunctional catalytic activity towards ORR and OER, with the potential difference of 0.8 V vs. RHE in considering the overall oxygen electrode activity, much smaller than that of RuO2 (0.96 V) and Pt/C (0.94 V). This work provides a new insight into the design of low-cost but efficient bifunctional catalyst for renewable energy applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we report a self-standing bifunctional electrode by coating MoS2-CoS2 heteronanosheet arrays on porous carbon microtube textile (MoS2-CoS2@PCMT) for alkaline overall water splitting. The abundant MoS2-CoS2 heterogeneous interfaces with electronic interaction (confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) can optimize the adsorption free energies for HER and OER intermediates (supported by the theoretical calculation), making MoS2-CoS2@PCMT achieve lower overpotentials for HER and OER than Pt/C@PCMT and RuO2@PCMT at higher current density. In addition, the freestanding structure of PCMT and the tight adhesion with MoS2-CoS2 heteronanosheets facilitate MoS2-CoS2@PCMT a long-term durability. As a result, the MoS2-CoS2@PCMT parallel to MoS2-CoS2@PCMT couple show a relatively low water-splitting voltage of 1.59 V at 10 mA cm(-2), and demonstrate lower cell voltage than the benchmark Pt/C@PCMT parallel to RuO2@PCMT couple at higher current density. This work gives prominence to the design of self-standing electrode structure and coupling of transition metal dichalcogenides to improve the performance of electrocatalysts for water splitting.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000707635300001

Herein, we synthesized the nanocomposites of activated carbon-anchored nickel oxide (AC-NiO) via fully green routes, and characterized their excellent OER performances. The AC-NiO nanocomposites were prepared by the facile sonication method using sonochemically prepared NiO nanoparticles and biomass-derived AC nanosponges. The nanocomposites exhibited an aggregated structure of the AC-NiO nanotablets with an average size of 40 nm. When using the nanotablets as an OER catalyst in 1 M KOH, the sample displayed superb electrocatalytic performances, i.e., a substantially low value of overpotential (320 mV at 10 mA/cm(2)), a significantly small Tafel slope (49 mV/dec), and a good OER stability (4% decrease of overpotential after 10 h). These outstanding OER characteristics are considered as attributing to the synergetic effects from both the ample surface area of the electrochemically active NiO nanoparticles and the high electrical conductivity of the AC nanosponges. The results pronounce that the fully ecofriendly synthesized AC-NiO nanotablets can play a splendid role as high-performance electrocatalysts for future green energy technology.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20				2079-4991		WOS:000556740400001	32679812

Porous nickel-cobalt nitride nanosheets on macroporous Ni foam (NF) are synthesized through facile electrodeposition followed by a one-step annealing process in a NH3 atmosphere. The transformation from a metal hydroxide into a metal nitride could efficiently enhance the electrocatalytic performance for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Interestingly, the incorporation of nickel further boosts the catalytic activity of cobalt nitride. When used as bifunctional electrocatalysts, the obtained nickel-cobalt nitride electrocatalyst shows good stability and superior catalytic performance toward both HER and OER with low overpotentials of 0.29 and 0.18 V, respectively, to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The good electrocatalytic performance was also evidenced by the fabrication of an electrolyzer for overall water splitting, which exhibits a high gas generation rate for hydrogen and oxygen with excellent stability during prolonged alkaline water electrolysis. The present work provides an efficient approach to prepare a 3 D interconnected porous nickel-cobalt nitride network with exposed inner active sites for overall water splitting.									136	4	0	0	4	0	138			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000414810200008	28857449

Herein, we propose a photochemical solid-phase reduction method to fabricate well-defined isolated Pt atoms on a nitrogen-doped porous carbon (Pt-1/NPC). Using this simple and fast synthesis strategy, the formed Pt atoms are well-dispersed on the carbon without clusters or nanoparticles. The loading of the Pt is up to 3.8 wt % relative to the carbon. The Pt-1/NPC catalyst displays an ultrahigh electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction with an overpotential of 25 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and mass activity of 2.86 A mg(-1) Pt (24-times higher than a commercial Pt/C). Moreover, the catalyst also presents efficient catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction. Its mass activity is 4.3-times that obtained by a commercial Pt (20 wt %). The improved electrocatalytic activities of the Pt-1/NPC catalyst are ascribed to the favorable chemical and electronic structure of the Pt-N-4 coordination raised by strong electron transfer from the isolated Pt atoms to the coordinated N atoms in this catalyst. The Pt-1/NPC can be employed as a bifunctional catalyst for fuel cells and hydrogen production.									159	13	0	0	9	0	160			2155-5435			WOS:000444364800074

The obtained product was identified as ATP/g-C3N4. In order to achieve the best catalyst, a series of ATP/g-C3N4 composites with different mass fraction of ATP were obtained and marked as ATP/g-C3N4-w, where w represents the mass fraction of ATP (w =mATP: (mATP + mg-C3N4)= 0.33, 0.40, 0.50, 0.67). Results show that g-C3N4 thin layers are uniformly loaded onto the ATP surface via the chemical bond (Si-O-C), which is beneficial to tailor the surface electronic structure of g-C3N4 and provide more active sites. Their electrocatalytic oxygen evolution properties in 0.1 mol/L KOH were investigated. It is found that ATP/g-C3N4-0.50 presents the best oxygen evolution catalytic performance and has excellent oxygen evolution stability. Its oxygen evolution over potential is 410 mV and the Tafel slope is 118 mV/dec at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). The results suggest that ATP/g-C3N4-0.50 can be used as a potential oxygen evolution catalyst.									2	1	0	0	0	0	3			1000-324X			WOS:000477003500002

The reaction is catalyzed by the oxomanganese complex of photosystem II, embedded in the thylakoid membrane of green plant chloroplasts and internal membranes of cyanobacteria. Biomimetic synthetic complexes have been developed over the years, although the reactivity of most of these complexes remains to be established. Here, we report a computational study of water splitting catalyzed by the mixed-valent oxomanganese dimer [H2O(terpy)Mn-III(mu-oxo)(2)Mn-IV(terpy)OH2](3+) (terpy = 2,2':6',2 ''-terpyridine) in acetate buffer, with emphasis on the origin of triplet oxygen and the noninnocent role of carboxylate ligands in the underlying reaction mechanism. Our calculations suggest triplet oxygen evolution from an end-on (eta(I)) Mn(III)-superoxo species, which forms from a hydroperoxo intermediate generated by nucleophilic attack of substrate water onto an oxyl radical Mn(IV)-O-center dot. Carboxylate groups of acetate facilitate formation of the oxyl radical by shifting the redox potential of the Mn complex upon exchange with water ligands, and catalyze the O-O bond formation by deprotonating the nucleophilic water molecule. These findings provide valuable insights on the origin of triplet oxygen and on the regulatory role of the environment surrounding the inorganic core of oxomanganese complexes during catalytic oxygen evolution.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			2155-5435			WOS:000352464400042

To meet industrial requirements, new methods for a simple, fast, environmental-friendly and cheap synthesis of robust, self-supported and high surface area electrodes are required. Herein, a novel in-liquid plasma (plasma electrolysis) approach for the growth of hierarchical nanostructures on nickel foam is reported on. Under morphology retention, iron can be doped into this high surface area electrode. For the oxidation of 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural and benzyl alcohol, the iron-free, plasma-treated electrode is more suitable reaching current densities up to 800 mA cm(-)(2) with Faradaic efficiencies above 95%. For the OER, the iron-doped nickel foam electrode reaches the industrially relevant current density of 500 mA cm(-)(2) at 1.473 +/- 0.013 V-RHE (60 degrees C) and shows no activity decrease over 140 h. The different effects of iron doping are rationalized using methanol probing and in situ Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, the intrinsic activity is separated from the number of active sites, and, for the organic oxidation reactions, diffusion limitations are revealed. The authors anticipate that the plasma modified nickel foam will be suitable for various (electro)catalytic processes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000842792000001

The discovery of efficient, durable, and earth-abundant electrocatalysts for water oxidation is highly desirable. Here, a novel trimetallic nitride compound grown on nickel foam (CoVFeN @ NF) is demonstrated, which is an ultra-highly active OER electrocatalyst that outperforms the benchmark catalyst, RuO2, and most of the state-of-the-art 3D transition metals and their compounds. CoVFeN @ NF exhibits ultralow OER overpotentials of 212 and 264 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2)in 1mKOH, respectively, together with a small Tafel slop of 34.8 mV dec(-1). Structural characterization reveals that the excellent catalytic activity mainly originates from: 1) formation of oxyhydroxide species on the surface of the catalyst due to surface reconstruction and phase transition, 2) promoted oxygen evolution possibly activated by peroxo-like (O-2(2-)) species through a combined lattice-oxygen-oxidation and adsorbate escape mechanism, 3) an optimized electronic structure and local coordination environment owing to the synergistic effect of the multimetal system, and 4) greatly accelerated electron transfer as a result of nitridation. This study provides a simple approach to rationally design cost-efficient and highly catalytic multimetal compound systems as OER catalysts for electrochemical energy devices.									93	2	0	0	6	0	93			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000574175400001

In this paper, the synthesis and electrocatalytic properties of a multifunctional ruthenium nickel boride hybrid electrocatalyst are reported for the first time. Compared to pristine nickel boride (Ni-B) and Ru electrocatalysts, Ru@Ni-B with trace Ru loading amount of 0.133 mg cm(-2) prepared by a simple wet chemical method, shows remarkably improved activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction, and the glucose oxidation reaction. The electrolytic cell assembled with Ru@Ni-B/nickel foam electrode as both cathode and anode can deliver 10 mA cm(-2) at only 1.42 V for alkaline overall water splitting and 1.24 V for glucose electrolysis. It is further found that the synergistic coupling of ruthenium with nickel boride plays an important role in the superior performance of the hybrid electrocatalyst.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2366-7486			WOS:000661051800001

However, several issues must be addressed for realizing the practical applications of LOBs. Among them, the evolution of singlet oxygen (O-1(2))-which undergoes vigorous reactions that compromise the stability of the system-is a key challenge. The high overpotential induced by low-conductivity lithium peroxide necessitates the use of a redox mediator (RM) to facilitate the charging process; however, RMs can also be degraded by O-1(2), which limits their efficacy in the long term. Recently, it was revealed that certain RMs play a role in suppressing the generation of O-1(2). In this review, the relationship between the RM and O-1(2) is described. Based on recent understandings, clear insight into RM reactions toward O-1(2) and possible future research directions will be provided.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000669116600001

LS1.05M exhibits 21% higher diffusion-controlled ORR current density, 87% higher OER current density at 0.8 V (vs Ag/AgCl 3.5 M), and ultralow electrochemical impedance compared to pristine LSM. LS1.1M has mixed performance relative to LSM due to structure instability. First-principles study by density functional theory (DFT) suggests that the free energy decrease from O* to *OOH is the rate-limiting step in OER. Transition metal d-band center and oxygen p-band center approaching the Fermi level are responsible for the enhanced electrochemical activity.									45	1	0	0	4	0	45			2155-5435			WOS:000471212600035

Remarkably, IFP-8 presents much lower overpotentials (319 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and 490 mV at SOO mA/cm(2)) than IFP-5 toward OER, as confirmed by online gas chromatography measurements (Faradaic yield of O-2 > 99%). Moreover, the system is extraordinarily stable during 120 h, even when used as a catalyst toward the overall water splitting reaction without any sign of fatigue. An integrated ex situ spectroscopic study, based on powder X-ray diffraction, extended X-ray absorption fine structure, and attenuated total reflection, allows the identification of the active species and the factors that determine the catalytic activity. Indeed, it was found that the performances are highly affected by the nature of the -R group, because this small change strongly influences the conversion of the initial metal organic framework to the active species. As a consequence, the remarkable activity of IFP-8 can be ascribed to the formation of Co(O)OH phase with a particle size of a few nanometers (3-10 nm) during the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2574-0962			WOS:000504953500066	31894205

Ni-Fe based compounds, especially Ni-Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH), have become highly efficient electrocatalysts to expedite the above reactions. During the last decade, great progress has been witnessed in the development of Ni-Fe based electrocatalysts. Diverse regulatory strategies such as morphology modulation, composition control, and defect engineering have been employed to optimize their electrochemical performances for water splitting. In addition, the family of Ni-Fe based compounds has been expanded from LDHs to alloys, sulfides, phosphides and so forth. Deep experimental investigations and theoretical studies have also been carried out to reveal the intrinsic origin of the superior electrocatalytic performances. In this review, we summarise the recent development of Ni-Fe based compounds for electrochemical water splitting with high efficiency. Special focus has been placed on the design principle and synthetic strategies of Ni-Fe based compounds. In the end, remaining challenges and future research directions are briefly discussed.									26	0	0	0	2	0	26			2516-0230			WOS:000599127600005	36133877

J	Shinkarev, VP; Xu, CH; Govindjee; Wraight, CA				Govindjee, Govindjee/ABF-3362-2021				Kinetics of the oxygen evolution step in plants determined from flash-induced chlorophyll a fluorescence								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				51	1			43	49		10.1023/A:1005721910729				JAN 1997	1997	Photosystem II (PS II) of plants and cyanobacteria, :which catalyzes the light-induced splitting of water and the release of oxygen, is the primary source of oxygen in the earth atmosphere. When activated by short light flashes, oxygen release in PS II occurs periodically with maxima after the third and the seventh flashes. Many other processes, including chlorophyll (Chi) a fluorescence, are also modulated with period of four, reflecting their sensitivity to the activity of Photosystem II. A new approach has teen developed for the analysis of the flash-induced fluorescence of Chl a in plants, which is based on the use of the generalized Stern-Volmer equation for multiple quenchers. When applied to spinach thylakoids, this analysis reveals the presence of a new quencher of fluorescence whose amplitude is characterized by a periodicity of four with maxima after the third and the seventh flashes, in phase with oxygen release. The quencher appears with a delay of approximate to 0.5 ms followed by a rise time of 1.2-2 ms at pH 7, also in agreement with the expected time for oxygen evolution. It is concluded that the quencher is a product of the reaction leading to the oxygen evolution in PS II. The same quenching activity, maximal after the third flash, could be seen in dark adapted leaves, and provides the first fully time-resolved measurement of the kinetics of the oxygen evolution step in the leaf. Thus, the non-invasive probe of Chl a fluorescence provides a new and sensitive method for measuring the kinetics of oxygen evolution with potential for use in plants and cyanobacteria in vivo.									24	0	0	0	21	0	24			0166-8595			WOS:A1997WX73300003

Herein, an effective electrocatalyst of boron-and iron-incorporated alpha-Co(OH)(2) (B-alpha-Co5.8Fe LDH) ultrathin nanosheets was synthesized for the OER by using sodium tetraphenylborate (NaTPB) as a mild alkali and boron source in ethylene glycol/water system (EG-W). Benefiting from the large accessible surface area (563 m(2) g(-1)) and the synergistic effect of Co-Fe-B, the catalyst (B-alpha-Co5.8Fe LDH) exhibits improved activity and stability in 1 M KOH solution with a low overpotential (264 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope (34 mV dec(-1)). In addition, this method was also applied to fabricate boron- and iron-incorporated alpha-Ni(OH)(2). This study should inspire a new pathway to design highly efficient OER catalysts.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2196-0216			WOS:000425380200004

Herein, by usingin situpolymerization of dopamine on specially designed metal-organic framework (MOF) nanocubes and subsequent annealing treatment, well-defined Co/N-doped carbon hollow nanocubes with high electrocatalytic activity and stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction are obtained. To attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the overpotential required for the Co/N-doped carbon hollow nanocubes is only 285 mV, which is comparable to that of commercial RuO2(270 mV) and lower than those of most MOF-derived ones and other carbon supported Co-based electrocatalysts. Surprisingly, we find that when the Co nanoparticles are leached using simple acid wash, the as-synthesized N-doped carbon hollow nanocubes could act as an efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction instead. The strategy presented here for controlled design and synthesis of MOF-derived hollow (metal)/N-doped carbon frameworks would offer new prospects for developing efficient oxygen electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy devices.									10	1	0	0	0	0	11			2398-4902			WOS:000544657200014

However, the low catalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits its practical application in rechargeable metal air batteries. In this work, the Mn02/Lao,Sro.3Mn03 hierarchical core shell composite materials with a special interface structure have been designed via the selective dissolution method. The core of La0.7Sr0.3Mn03 particles is wrapped by the porous and loose Mn02 nanoparticles. The as prepared Mn02/La0.7Sr0.3Mn03 materials have excellent catalytic activity toward ORR/OER and are used as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for metal air batteries. Based on results of transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, valence-band spectroscopy, and 02 temperature-programmed desorption analysis, we conclude that the bifunctional catalytic activity of the Mn02/La0.7Sr03Mn03 materials can be effectively promoted due to the specific interface structure between the Lai_xSr Mn03 core and the Mn02 shell. This can be attributed to three aspects: (a) the electronic conductivity, which is beneficial for providing the faster charge-transfer paths and kinetics at the oxide/solution interface than that of the MnO, sample; (b) the enhancement of oxygen adsorption capacity due to surface defects (oxygen vacancies) and chemical adsorption, which is helpful to improve the reaction kinetics during the process of oxygen catalysis; and (c) the tuning of oxygen adsorption ability via the moderate Mn-0 bond strength, which may be conducive to getting for obtain an enhanced Mn-0 bond strength on the surfaces for ORR and a weakened Mn-0 bond in the lattice for OER.									39	1	0	0	4	0	39			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000477787200025	31259515

Herein, without any template or surfactant, in situ grown nitrogen-doped carbon-nanotube (NCNT)-embedded with two phases of bimetal CoFe alloys and CoFe2O4 spinel oxide are constructed, using inexpensive materials of glucose, urea, and cobalt/iron acetates by programing the pyrolysis temperature. The obtained catalyst with optimal cobalt/iron acetates mass ratio (1:1) denoted as CoFe-CoFe2O4-NCNT not only exceeds Pt-Ru/C in terms of ORR half-wave potentials [(0.88 vs 0.84 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)] and limiting current densities (6.40 vs 5.40 mA cm(-2)), but also manifests superior OER activity with the potentials of (1.58 vs 1.67 V versus RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2). Therefore, CoFe-CoFe2O4-NCNT exhibits a smaller Delta E value of (0.70 V versus RHE), surpassing that of Pt-Ru/C (0.85 V versus RHE) and shows excellent stability as well as outstanding methanol tolerance compared with the Pt-Ru/C commercial catalyst. In addition, CoFe-CoFe2O4-NCNT applied as a bifunctional air electrode in rechargeable ZAB displays a promising rechargeability performance with high-discharge and low-charge potentials and a relatively stable potential gap under 550 cycles, outperforming those of Pt-Ru/C.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000623504700001

Highly efficient bifunctional catalysts for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions (ORR/OER) are essential for the replacement of platinum, ruthenium and iridium metals. We used four different silica templates to create excellent mesoporous cobalt oxide (Co3O4) electrocatalysts in crystalline form. Various advanced techniques confirm the spinel structure composed of both Co3+ and Co2+ sites, which lead to an enhanced surface area, mesoporosity, and a rod morphology with a cubic-like network structure. Among these replicas, the Mobil composition of matter (MCM)-48-derived Co3O4 (Co3O4-M8) material demonstrates remarkable OER activity with an observed potential of 1.76 V, a Tafel slope of 107 mV dec(-1) and a lower charge transfer resistance. Such a high performance is observed due to assistance of the Co3+ to Co4+ transition during the oxygen evolution reaction. The ORR was more active on the Korea advanced institute of science and technology (KIT)-6-derived Co3O4 (Co3O4-K6) material, which displayed a more positive onset potential of 0.85 V, a half-wave potential of 0.56 V and a better current density in alkaline medium. In addition, we found that the stabilization of Co2+ active sites in the Co3O4-K6 material is the reason for the enhanced oxygen reduction reaction. The observed bifunctional activity (Delta E = E-OER@10 mA cm(-2) - ORR@E-1/2) for the Co3O4-K6 catalyst is 1.22 V, which shows significant performance among all the catalysts prepared in this work. Such an earth-abundant mesoporous Co3O4 catalyst obtained via an environmentally benign process is anticipated to revolutionize electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000688136600001

Firstly, qualitative and quantitative analyses to groups in Datong coal were achieved by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The results indicate that oxygen functional groups in this coal include hydroxyl, carboxyl, carbonyl group, and ether. Higher levels of oxygen functional groups and aromatic structures as well as low content of fat structure were found in Datong coal by peak fitting. Secondly, the main chemical reactions and effects during the pyrolysis of coal are described. Then, the evolution of the chemical structure and transformation mechanism of oxygen functional groups in Datong coal were represented and analyzed by wet chemical analysis. The analysis reveals that aromatic structures were heated and decomposed, oxygen was adsorbed, and then the phenolic hydroxyl groups were formed. When the temperature reaches 300 A degrees C or higher, aromatic rings in phenolic hydroxyl were cracked and the carboxyl group was generated. The main purpose of this paper is to study the influence of temperature on the group types and their content in coal, and further to explain the evolution mechanism of the oxygen functional groups in the process of coal pyrolysis.									23	2	0	0	3	0	24			1388-6150	1588-2926		WOS:000404994900054

However, rational design of SACs and boosting their performances for oxygen electrocatalysis and rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs) are still crucial yet challenging. Herein, single Co atoms anchored in ultrathin N, P-codoped porous carbon nanosheets (Co-SA/NPC) were prepared by an in situ confinement pyrolysis strategy. The ultrathin nanosheet structure provides an ideal platform for high exposure of the generated Co active sites and extremely shortens the electron transport pathways. Both experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the N/P coordinated Co sites enable optimized charge distribution and facilitate oxygen intermediate adsorption/desorption. Such a Co-SA/NPC catalyst exhibits high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity with a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.87 V and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with a low potential of 1.67 V at 10 mA cm(-2). As an air electrode in ZABs, it demonstrates a high peak power density of 204.3 mW cm(-2) and excellent long-term stability in aqueous ZABs. It also reveals superior flexibility and stability in solid-state ZABs. Thus, Co-SA/NPC is a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for practical applications in aqueous and flexible solid-state ZABs.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000703044800001

However, their sluggish reaction kinetics and poor stability hinder their commercial use. Here, we report the facile design and synthesis of N-doped NiS1.03 hollow spheres (N- NiS1.03 HS) for use as efficient bifunctional OER/ORR electrocatalysts. By simultaneous energy-level engineering via N doping and structural modification via hollow nanosphere designing, synthetic N- NiS1.03 HS can be produced; it exhibits a low overpotential of 250 mV (1.48 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (E-j (= 10)) for the OER and a high half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.72 V for the ORR; further, its bifunctional OER/ORR performance is comparable to that of noble metal electrocatalysts. First-principle calculation results reveal that N dopants can simultaneously downshift the d-band center and reduce the overpotential of the rate-determining step of NiS1.03, thus assisting in the adsorption/desorption of oxygen intermediates on active sites and accelerating reaction kinetics in electrocatalytic processes. Furthermore, N-NiS1.03 HS-based Zn-air batteries exhibit a small charge-discharge gap (0.64 V), high open-circuit potential (1.41 V), large specific capacity (821 mA h g(-1) zn at 10 mA cm(-2)), and long-term cycling stability (5 mA cm(-2) for 60 h), thus showing great potential as future energy-efficient metal-air batteries.									42	4	0	0	1	0	42			2405-8297			WOS:000508681700022

Increasing of the calcination temperature leads to the changes of palladium states in the catalysts structure from solid solution to surface clusters and nanoparticles. Kinetic simulation showed that surface clusters are the most active species at temperatures below 100 degrees C. The blurry CO2 evolution in the temperature range 100-250 degrees C is determined by the effect of bulk-surface transfer of lattice oxygen to the surface clusters. The separate sharp peak at 200 degrees C was simulated to be attributed to the reduction of the nanoparticles. In the high-temperature range of TPR-CO the reduced active centres on the surface of ceria are supplied with oxygen from the ceria bulk. Upon increasing the calcination temperature, the concentration of active oxygen in the ceria lattice taking part in the reaction with CO increases, and the catalyst is more reduced.

For technological implementation, both reactions require highly active and stable electrocatalysts. Here, we report the simultaneous functionalization of carbon nanotubes with bimetallic manganese-vanadium OER/ORR catalytic sites, and nitrogen/sulfur atoms to increase electrical conductivity. A bottom-up fabrication route using polyoxometalate metal precursors enables facile and scalable deposition of bimetallic catalysts on the carbon nanotubes. Electrocatalytic OER/ORR studies show the high activity and stability of the composite under alkaline aqueous conditions, and comparable performance to commercial PVC (20 wt.%) was observed. Initial mechanistic analyses shed light on the effects of the bimetallic functionalization as well as the N/S-doping of the carbon nanotubes. In future, the use of heterometallic polyoxometalate precursors could allow the variation of metal types and atomic ratios, which could lead to well-defined bimetallic composites for various electrochemical processes.									42	0	0	0	3	0	42			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000552015900031

The substitution of thermodynamically more favorable organic oxidation reactions for oxygen evolution reaction avoids the requirement of the membrane, accompanied by the generation of value-added products at the anode. Herein, with the help of the bimetallic Ni/Co metal-organic framework derivative (t-Ni/Co MOF) as the anodic electrocatalyst, we develop an oxidant-free condition for the selective conversion of primary amines into nitriles. Specifically, aromatic and aliphatic nitriles can be conveniently obtained with good yields and faradaic efficiencies over the t-Ni/Co MOF electrode when coupling with the hydrogen evolution reaction. Notably, benzylamine can be oxidized into benzonitrile even at an ultralow potential of 1.30 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) over the t-Ni/Co MOF electrode, which is lower than that of the reported Ni-based monometallic electrocatalysts for benzylamine elecrooxidation.

Herein, inspired by the superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of transition metal oxide and remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of transition metal phosphide, hierarchical NiCo2O4/Ni2P core-shell nanocone array on Ni foam is synthesized. The synergetic effect between the NiCo2O4 "core" and the Ni2P "shell" results in dramatically enhanced catalytic performance. It shows higher activity and longer durability in both OER and HER than bare NiCo2O4 or Ni2P. The hierarchical NiCo2O4/Ni2P catalyst is capable of catalyzing OER with a low overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media. Moreover, it shows excellent catalytic activity for HER to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of 45 mV. When the NiCo2O4/Ni2P is adopted as both anode and cathode in a two-electrode cell for overall water splitting, it only needs 1.59 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Almost no decay is observed after the electrodes work for about 50 h. The newly developed electrocatalyst combines the satisfactory working stability with outstanding catalytic activity, which paves the way for exploring overall water splitting catalysts.									48	2	0	0	1	0	49			2196-7350			WOS:000413572500006

In this study, by using an electrochemical activation pretreatment, metal oxy(hydroxide) nanosheet structures derived from self-supported nickel-iron phosphide and nitride nanoarrays grown on Ni foam are successfully fabricated for OER catalysis in saline water. It is demonstrated that the different NiOOH and NiOOH@FeOOH (NiOOH grown on FeOOH) structures are generated from nickel-iron nitride and phosphide, respectively, after electrochemical activation. In particular, the NiOOH@FeOOH heteroarchitecture shows outstanding electrocatalytic performance with an ultralow overpotential of 292 mV to drive the current density of 500 mA cm(-2). An unconventional dual-sites mechanism (UDSM) is proposed to address the OER process on NiOOH@FeOOH and show that the FeOOH underlayer plays a critical role regarding the enhanced OER activity of NiOOH. The new possible UDSM involving two reaction sites presents a different understanding of the OER process on multi-OH layer complexes, which is expected to guide the design of heteroarchitecture electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000859145100001	36055645

Although the relationship between the photocatalytic behaviors and particles' size/shape has been widely investigated by theoretical scientists, the experimental evidences are much less. In this manuscript, we successfully synthesized three new ruthenium dye-sensitized polyoxometalates (POM-n, n relate to different size clusters) with different-sized POM clusters. Under visible-light illumination, all three complexes show the stable O-2 evolution with the efficient order POM-3 > POM-2 > POM-1. This cluster-size-dependent catalytic behavior could be explained by the different numbers of M = O-t (terminal oxygen) bonds in each individual cluster because it is well-known that Mo = O-t groups are the catalytically active sites for photooxidation reaction. The proposed mechanism of water oxidation for the dye-sensitized POMs is radical reaction process. This research could open up new perspectives for developing new POM-based WOCs.									64	0	0	0	5	0	64			2045-2322			WOS:000318965000003	23676701

Herein, the doping and vacancy double control strategy for the design of bifunctional catalysts is firstly demonstrated for the significant enhancement of HER/OER catalytic performances by constructing Fe doped-Ni5P4/Fe-doped Ni(OH)2 (Fe-Ni5P4/NiFeOH) hybrid nanosheets with rich oxygen vacancies. The experimental studies and first-principle calculations both prove that the combined effects of Fe doping and oxygen vacancy can easily regulate the electronic structure and accordingly optimize the adsorptions/desorptions of intermediates. The bifunctional Fe-Ni5P4/NiFeOH-350 shows small overpotentials of 197 and 221 mV for HER and OER, respectively, along with a low cell voltage of 1.55 V at 10 mA cm-2 and excellent long-term stability for water splitting.									59	2	0	0	3	0	59			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000663284400005

It was observed that oxygen evolution starts at about 1.1 Vsce and this value of voltage does not depend on the thickness of the anodic coating or on the type of applied pretreatments. This oxidation reaction seems to take place at active sites related with the intermetallics of copper present at the specimen surface.Deterioration of the electrical characteristics of the anodic films formed at various constant voltages and increase of leakage current through these films during the anodic potentiodynamic polarization were observed. These phenomena appeared when a critical value of anodization voltage was exceeded. Their origin did not seem to affect the value of potential (1.1 Vsce) where the oxygen evolution started.

It was found that the electrocatalytic activity of the dynamic self-optimizing (DSO) 25 h-Ni3S2-NF for oxygen evolution is significantly enhanced compared with that of pristine 0 h-Ni3S2-NF since the formed oxide layer evolves into new active sites and the specific process of activity optimization was explored dynamically. The best oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance was achieved by 25 h-Ni3S2-NF catalyst, which required merely 241 mV overpotential to deliver a current density of 20 mA cm(-2), and its Tafel slope was as low as similar to 40 mV dec(-1), which was superior to most nickel-based catalysts, in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The current density was found to be increased gradually at the same potential and the stability test curves were steady with ignorable decline, showing that the promising strategy of the preparation of a dynamic self-optimizing pre-catalyst may open a new pathway to prepare low-cost, high-performance and stable water splitting catalysts.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000507637400005	31799573

Here, NixFe1-xB prepared by a facile borothermal reduction in molten salt is a robust bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. The NixFe1-xB electrocatalyst achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 63.5 mV for the HER and 282 mV for the OER in 1 M KOH electrolyte, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the NixFe1-xB possesses a lower absolute value of H* adsorption free energy (|Delta G(H*)|) than the primitive FeB and NiB, which is beneficial to improve the HER activity. Two identical NixFe1-xB electrodes are combined to form an alkaline electrolyzer, which achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.57 V for overall water splitting. This work provides a strategy to develop highly efficient transition metal boride catalysts for overall water splitting.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000526936600033

Firstly CoOx colloids were synthesized via ethylene glycol solvothermal method and cast on conductive glass substrates. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysis of these as-prepared Co3O4 thin films were then significantly enhanced via a simple surface reduction by NaBH4 solution. The OER catalytic performance of the NaBH4-reduced thin films was strongly dependent on the NaBH4 concentration. The use of NaBH4-reduced thin film electrodes for OER in alkaline solution supported higher current density and consequently negative shifts of the onset potential compared to that of the pristine. The optimal B-12.5,B- 20-Co3O4 thin films exhibited excellent OER catalytic performances: At the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2), a low overpotential of 365 mV and a small Tafel slope of 59.0 mV.dec(-1) were observed. In addition, these B12.5, 20-Co3O4 thin film electrodes possessed good stability that can well recover its OER performance in a 24-h chronoamperometric stability test.

The core reaction mechanism of the battery is mainly the formation of alkali metal oxide during the discharge process and the decomposition of these oxides during the charge process. A large number of researchers have devoted themselves to seeking promising catalysts for the reaction. Two-dimensional Nb2O5 was discovered to be a highly potential catalyst that can promote the reaction of alkali-metal-oxygen batteries, but few studies focus on it. In this study, the catalytic performance of both pristine Nb2O5 and oxygen-deficiency modified Nb2O5 was investigated. Furthermore, the effect of oxygen defects on catalytic performance was analyzed from multiple angles, namely, the reaction mechanism, d-band center theory, and the diffusion behavior of alkali metals. The exploration revealed the microscopic mechanism of oxygen deficiency affecting the alkali-metal battery reaction and provided a theoretical basis for quantitatively changing the d-band center of the catalyst through oxygen deficiency to ultimately change the performance of the catalyst.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000714645600001	34643049

It is established that desorption of reaction intermediates is rate limiting in all the cases examined, and it is proposed that elementary reactions leading to oxygen evolution take place at a surface consisting of crystal line (PbO2) and hydrous [PbO(OH)(2)] zones. Contribution of the latter becomes particularly pronounced at high potentials, probably on account of PbO2 dissolution and re-deposition in the form of Pb(OH)(4) that subsequently evolves to give PbO(OH)(2). This process is indicated as a possible cause of an inflexion point in the Tafel plots between 1.95 and 2.0 V SCE. Different important factors are found to affect the electrochemical process: (i) pre-treatment of the electrode, which makes electrodes more active by reason of an increase of the hydrous zones; (ii) the temperature at which electrodeposition of PbO2 is carried out has an effect on the hydration state of the surface and hence the electrocatalytic activity; (iii) electrolyte anions, particularly SO42- and CF3SO3-, are adsorbed and inhibit both water discharge and desorption of reaction intermediates; besides, they undergo oxidation at the more positive potentials; (iv) fluoride added to the electrolyte is strongly adsorbed and suppresses and/or modifies the structure of the hydrous layer with the consequence that water discharge is inhibited in the lower potential range and, prevalently at the more positive potentials, desorption of oxygen intermediates is strongly retarded; and (v) a low electrolyte temperature also inhibits 02 evolution mainly by inhibition of the desorption of reaction intermediates in the whole potential range examined, in contrast to the selective effect of fluoride.

We demonstrated that the aqueous-phase corrosion of a conventional Ni foam in the presence of exotic Fe3+ cations can directly transform it into an electrode with high catalytic activity and stability for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The surface of the corroded electrode consisted of densely packed, small Ni0.75Fe2.25O4 nanoparticles with sizes less than 5 nm. This electrode required an overpotential of only 192 mV to reach an OER current density of 10 mA/cm2 in 1 M KOH, outperforming the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst by 73 mV. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the unique surface structure and iron composition of Ni0.75Fe2.25O4 nanoparticles play a key role in achieving an improved OER activity. When coupled with a Pt/C hydrogen-evolving catalyst, the resulting anion-exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzer achieved an overall water-splitting current density as high as 2.0 A/cm2 at a cell voltage of 1.9 V in 1 M KOH, which was 1.7 times that obtained from the IrO2 and Pt/C catalyst pair and also much greater than reported values from other AEM water electrolyzers. By revisiting and exploiting a traditional corrosion process, our work opens a simple, cost-effective, and scalable route to a high-performance OER electrode for efficient AEM water electrolysis.									19	2	0	0	2	0	20			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000664255000001

An ideal OER electrocatalyst should show high exposure of active sites and optimal adsorption energies of oxygenated species. However, earth-abundant transition-metal-based OER electrocatalysts still operate with sluggish OER kinetics. Here, a cation-exchange route is reported to fabricate cobalt-vanadium-iron (oxy)hydroxide (CoV-Fe-0.28) nanosheets with tunable binding energies for the oxygenated intermediates. The formation of an amorphous/crystalline heterostructure in the CoV-Fe(0.28)catalyst boosts the exposure of active sites compared to their crystalline and amorphous counterparts. Furthermore, the synergetic interaction of Co, V, and Fe cations in the CoV-Fe(0.28)catalyst subtly regulates the local coordination environment and electronic structure, resulting in the optimal thermodynamic barrier for this elementary reaction step. As a result, the CoV-Fe(0.28)catalyst exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity toward the OER. A low overpotential of 215 mV is required to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)with a small Tafel slope of 39.1 mV dec(-1), which outperforms commercial RuO2(321 mV and 86.2 mV dec(-1), respectively).									89	4	0	0	2	0	90			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000574174000001

The OER activity increases in the order truncated octahedral < cubic < spherical < octahedral, despite a larger surface area (2.9 m(2) g(-1)) for the spherical sample compared to nearly similar surface areas (0.3-0.7 m(2) g(-1)) for the other three samples. The high activity of the octahedral sample is attributed to the regular octahedral shape with low-energy {111} surface planes, whereas the lowest activity of the truncated octahedral sample is attributed to the high-energy {001} surface planes. The octahedral sample also exhibits the lowest Tafel slope of 70 mV dec(-1) with the highest durability whereas the truncated octahedral sample exhibits the highest Tafel slope of 120 mV dec(-1) with durability similar to the cubic and spherical samples. The study demonstrates that the catalytic activities of oxide catalysts could be tuned and optimized by controlling the surface morphologies/planes via novel synthesis approaches.									49	2	0	0	2	0	50			2155-5435			WOS:000331164000007

Herein, we report a simple yet robust strategy via zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)-triggered rapid polymerization of dopamine for crafting cage-in-cage hollow porous carbon codoped with Co and N for highly-efficient ORR and OER electrocatalysts. First, dopamine (DA) is expeditiously polymerized on ZIF-67 within 10 min at room temperature, yielding yolk-shelled ZIF-67@polydopamine-x (denoted ZIF-67@PDA-x) particles with tunable PDA thickness. This contrast sharply to the copious past works where alkaline compounds are needed for the polymerization of DA. More importantly, the ZIF-67-triggered polymerization of DA is substantiated to undergo a coordination-dissociation-polymerization mechanism rendered by the synergistic effect of Co2+ and 2-methylamidazole. Subsequent one-step pyrolysis of ZIF-67@PDA yields Co and N codoped cage-in-cage porous carbon (denoted Co/N CCPC-x). The resulting Co/N CCPC pyrolyzed at 600 degrees C manifests a superior ORR with the onset and half-wave potentials comparable to Pt/C and limiting current density larger than Pt/C, OER with low overpotential and potential difference, and Zn-air performance with high open-circuit voltage, specific capacity, power density and remarkable charge-discharge reversibility. Such impressive ORR and OER performances of Co/N CCPC are a direct consequence of simultaneous compositional (i.e., Co and N codoping) and structural (i.e., cage-in-cage architecture with hierarchical porosity) tailoring enabled by judicious PDA coating.									37	1	0	0	2	0	37			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000653012100011

Herein, a type of content-controllable amorphous Ni-Fe-P catalyst with a bicontinuous nanostructure has been reported to be useful as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. np-(NixFe1-x)(4)P-5 is prepared simply by an electrochemical dealloying method. Owing to the bicontinuous nanostructure, amorphous atomic arrangement, metallic nature, and the substitution of Ni by Fe, np-(Ni0.67Fe0.33)(4)P-5 exhibits excellent catalytic performance with the overpotentials of 245 mV and 120 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER in 1 M KOH, respectively. Furthermore, the np-(Ni0.67Fe0.33)(4)P-5 catalyst as both an anode and a cathode shows a high current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low potential of 1.62 V in a two-electrode water electrolysis system with excellent stability for 20 h.									89	8	0	0	1	0	90			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000431506600009

However, constructing catalytically active heterostructures with novel composition and architecture remains poorly developed due to the synthetic challenge. In this work, it is demonstrated that unique Ni(CN)(2)/NiSe2 heterostructures, composed of single-crystalline Ni(CN)(2) nanoplates surrounded by crystallographically aligned NiSe2 nanosatellites, can be created from nickel-based Hofmann-type coordination polymers through stepwise topochemical pathways. When employed as the OER electrocatalyst, the Ni(CN)(2)/NiSe2 heterostructures show enhanced performance, which could be attributed to optimized geometric and electronic structures of the catalytic sites endowed by the synergy between the two components. This work demonstrates a rational synthetic route for creating a novel Ni-based OER electrocatalyst that possesses nanoscale heterostructure, whose composition, spatial organization, and interface configuration can be finely manipulated.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000728229100001	34726305

Herein, we report the rational tuning of surface electronic structure of FePS3 nanosheets (NSs) by anchoring atomically dispersed metal atom. Theoretical calculations predict that the strong electronic coupling effect in single-atom Ni-FePS3 facilitates electron aggregation from Fe atom to the nearby Ni-S bond and enhances the electron-transfer of Ni and S sites, which balances the oxygen species adsorption capacity, reinforces water adsorption and dissociation process to accelerate corresponding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The optimal Ni-FePS3 NSs/C exhibits outstanding electrochemical water-splitting activities, delivering an overpotential of 287 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 41.1 mV dec(-1) for OER; as well as an overpotential decrease of 219 mV for HER compared with pure FePS3 NSs/C. The concept of electronic coupling interaction between the substrate and implanted single active species offers an additional method for catalyst design and beyond.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2575-0356		WOS:000670632900001

CoFe nanoalloy particles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon and nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (CoFe@NC-NCNT-H) are synthesized by pyrolyzing a Prussian blue analogue precursor (i.e. Fe-3[Co(CN)(6)](2)) as low as 600 degrees C, and followed by HNO3 treatment. Such low temperature pyrolysis and HNO3 treatment affords the hybrid mesoporous material with a high level of nitrogen content (similar to 10%) and a relatively high specific surface area (similar to 210.5 m(2) g(-1)), capable of providing active sites and mass transport channels. In alkaline solution, CoFe@NC-NCNT-H is highly active towards OER with a low onset potential (similar to 1.35 V) and a small overpotential (similar to 380 mV) to reach 10.0 mA cm(-2), comparable to the state-of-the-art RUO2. CoFe@NC-NCNT-H is also a good ORR catalyst, and more importantly it exhibits an improved stability compared to commercial Pt/C. CoFe@NC-NCNT-H displays promise as a bifunctional catalyst with an extremely low potential difference (similar to 0.87 V between ORR at -3.0 mA cm(-2) and OER at 10.0 mA cm(-2)), superior to commercial Pt/C and RUO2. The facilely prepared CoFe@NC-NCNT-H with high bifunctional performance and stability promises great potential for ORR and OER. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Here we first develop a general self-dissociation-assembly (SDA) strategy for in situ synthesis of well-defined ultrathin CoNi-MOF nanosheet arrays (CoNi-MOFNA) as highly active OER electrode. Remarkably, CoNi-MOFNA exhibit excellent OER activity and long-term stability, which deliver the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 215 mV with negligible decay even after 300 h continuous electrolysis. The mass activity of CoNi-MOFNA is 14-times higher than commercial RuO2. In addition, the systematic electrochemistry and time-dependent XAS spectroscopy studies convincingly identify the OER active sites of coordinatively unsaturated metal nodes and uncover the structure evolution of CoNi-MOFNA. More importantly, we have demonstrated the universality of this significant SDA strategy for controllably fabricating other types of ultrathin MOF nanosheet arrays uniformly on diverse metal substrates.									61	5	0	0	1	0	63			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000513811800068

Herein, we report HER, OER and ORR electrocatalytic performances of metal-organic framework (MOF) derived cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon and carbon nanotube (CoONC/CNT). The optimized Co@NC/CNT hybrid shows superior HER and OER activities with a small overpotential of 137 mV and 302 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, the Co@NC/CNT as an air-cathode in secondary Zn-air battery demonstrates a confined potential gap of 0.88 V over 200 h and a maximum power density of 53.4 mW cm-2, which are much better than those of Pt/C. The outstanding performances are attributed to the synergistic effects from Co, and N embedded into carbon and CNT. More importantly, the unique surface structure contributes to expose many active sites for superior catalytic activity through allowing a large number of electrons. These outcomes not only prove a facile approach for the preparation of metals/carbon hybrid but also disclose its huge possible as a multifunctional electrocatalyst for sustainable energy systems.

Here, we present a systematic ab initio thermodynamics study analyzing the shape and stability of IrO2 nanoparticles in this potential range. Our results confirm a thermodynamic instability of the rutile crystal structure induced by the stabilization of highly oxidized O species at the surface already at onset potentials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Intriguingly, this is preceded by a transformation of the equilibrium shape at even lower potentials. Instead of the well-studied IrO2(110) facets, this shape is dominated by IrO2(111) facets that have hitherto barely received attention. Our findings highlight the need to extend detailed characterization studies to this high-potential range, not the least to establish more suitable active-site models for the OER that may then serve as the basis for computational screening studies aimed at reducing the rare-metal content in future PEM OER catalysts.									36	0	0	0	1	0	36			2155-5435			WOS:000471212600022

Herein, a typical hierarchical W18O49/NiWO4 heterojunction grown on nickel foam was successfully synthesized via a multistep synthesis strategy. The electrochemical oxidation and reduction process triggers the amorphization of W18O49 and significantly enhances the interfacial interaction, thereby endowing the composites with enriched active sites. The W18O49/NiWO4/NF is completely reconstructed to NiWO4/NF and NiWO4/NiOOH/NF with amorphous-crystalline interface (denoted as H-AM/NiWO4/NF for HER and O-AM/NiWO4/NiOOH/NF for OER). The valence of tungsten ions is well modulated to achieve a high proportion of tetravalent W (IV) active sites accompanied by abundant oxygen vacancies. The increased Ni (III) ions as OER active sites have strong orbital overlap with reaction intermediate, which stabilize the low-valent W (IV) by producing more NiOOH species during the oxygen evolution reaction. Benefiting from the amorphous-crystalline composites, unsaturated W (IV) sites, abundant oxygen vacancies, and highly active NiOOH species, the activated electrocatalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity, achieving a small overpotential of 1.53 V at 10 mA.cm(-2) for water-splitting and maintaining long-term stability at least 100 h.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000663747500007

Regulating the evolution of distinctive TMSs is highly desirable but remains challenging to date. Anions, as essential elements involved in the synthesis, have been totally neglected previously in the construction of TMSs. Herein, the effects of anions on the creation of different types of TMSs are investigated for the first time. It is found that the active cobalt-nitrogen sites tend to be selectively constructed on the surface of N-doped carbon by using chloride, while metallic cobalt nanoparticles encased in protective graphite layers are the dominant forms of cobalt species with nitrate ions. The obtained catalysts demonstrate cobalt-sites-dependent activity for oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic media. The remarkably enhanced catalytic activities approaching that of benchmark Pt/C in an acidic medium have been obtained on the catalyst dominated with cobalt-nitrogen sites, confirmed by the advanced spectroscopic characterization. This finding demonstrates a general paradigm of anion-regulated evolution of distinctive TMSs, providing a new pathway for enhancing performances of various targeted reactions related with TMSs.									106	6	0	0	2	0	106			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000418068700008	29105848

Therefore, a bi-functional composite catalyst of N-MoS2 center dot Ni3S2/NiS with specific Mo-N structure and heterogeneous interface was rationally prepared through the self-catalysis strategy. The ultra-thin hierarchical morphology of N-MoS2 center dot Ni3S2/NiS facilitates the exposure of active catalytic sites and the acceleration of electron transmission at the reaction interface. Furthermore, both theoretical calculations and experiments testify that the Mo-N structure and Ni-S sites on the heterogeneous interface between Ni3S2 and NiS are, respectively, specific intrinsic active catalytic sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the NiOOH formed by in situ oxidation at the interface is a synergistic catalytic site for the OER, and the doping of heteroatom N and the heterogeneous interface jointly regulate the electronic structure of N-MoS2 center dot Ni3S2/NiS, boosting overall water splitting. The optimized catalyst, N-MoS2 center dot Ni3S2/NiS, exhibits excellent performance; the overpotential is only 70 mV and 231 mV, respectively, for the HER and OER at 10 mA cm(-2).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000797042400001

Herein, the Rh-Cu alloy nanocrystals (NCs) are prepared with a simple wet-chemical approach. The tuning of morphology and the asymmetric electron distribution provide more efficient Rh-Cu bimetallic sites. Meanwhile, the incorporation of Cu into the Rh lattice could reduce the oxidation of Rh-Cu bimetallic sites and increase the catalytic stability. Under the tuning of the composition, the drastically enhanced electrocatalytic activities of HER, OER, and ORR are achieved in the Rh6Cu1 NCs with the cell voltage required to be as low as 1.55 V to accomplish an overall water splitting of 10 mA cm(-2) and a maximum power density of 142.58 mW cm(-2) for a zincair battery with good stability, representing the best trifunctional electrocatalysts for all we know.

Key challenges with this technology include high overpotential losses associated with catalyzing the electrochemical reactions (i.e., oxygen reduction and evolution reactions) at the cathode of the battery.

We demonstrate the ability to control the nanostructure of La2NiO4+delta electrocatalyst at the nanoscale level using a reverse-microemulsion synthesis approach. We show that Li-O-2 batteries with cathodes containing rod-shaped La2NiO4+delta electrocatalyst exhibit lower charging potentials and higher reversible capacities when compared to batteries with carbon-only cathodes. Our studies indicate that the enhancement in the battery performance induced by the rod-shaped La2NiO4+delta electrocatalyst can be attributed to the fact that La2NiO4+delta nanorods (i) facilitate the formation of nanosized Li2O2 particles during discharge, and (ii) promote the electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction during charging. These findings open up avenues for the utilization of (i) reverse-microemulsion method for controlling the nanostructure of layered oxide materials, and (ii) nanorod-structured nickelate oxides as efficient cathode electrocatalysts for Li-O-2 batteries.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1022-5528	1572-9028		WOS:000353575500013

However, the limited catalytic activity of BP nanosheets limits its practical application. Here, a one-pot hot solution method is used to synthesize a mixed-dimensional hybrid of BP nanosheets loaded with Au nanoparticles (BP/Au). The electrochemical test results show the BP/Au exhibits excellent electrocatalytic oxygen evolution performance with an ultra-low onset potential (1.36 V) and Tafel slope (68.1 mV dec(-1)). The first-principles calculation results further support the experimental results, in which the loading of Au nanoparticles realizes the transition of BP from the semiconductor phase to the metal phase, which makes the BP/Au exhibit faster carrier mobility. The BP/Au also exhibits a Gibbs free energy closer to the optimal value of the OER. This is because Au nanoparticles can inject free electrons unto the surface of BP and realize the coupling effect between the local semiconductor and metal, thereby effectively improving the carrier mobility and catalytic activity. This work fully confirms that the BP/Au is a suitable candidate for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution, and provides effective strategies for constructing efficient electrocatalysts.									36	2	0	0	2	0	37			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000576658200001

This study presents a facile approach for the scalable synthesis of nanostructured cobalt phosphide embedded in carbon nanosheets (CoP NPs/CNSs). The hybrid structures show highly efficient trifunctional electrocatalytic activities toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under alkaline condition. The catalytic performances, which are remarkably superior to those of the previously reported CoP nanostructures enclosed by single or a few low index facets, can be attributed to the nearly spherical shape of the CoP nanoparticles with many more exposed crystal planes. Density functional theory (DFT) computations are performed to investigate the facet effects of CoP on electrocatalytic activity, and they reveal the relatively low overpotentials of (101) facets towards the OER and the free energy of water dissociation (Delta G<INF>H<INF>2</INF>O</INF>) and adsorbed H intermediates (Delta G<INF>H*</INF>) of (311) toward the HER being close to thermoneutral. This work is expected to inspire the design and fabrication of multifunctional and high-efficiency electrocatalysts by selectively exposing specific crystal planes.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15				2046-2069		WOS:000504904200040	35541410

The scarcity of the elemental Ir makes large-scale applications more challenging, so increasing the material utilization efficiency is critical. We developed a sophisticated soft-templating method to synthesize mesoporous nanosheets via solution-based assembly of close-packed polymeric micelles in the presence of metal precursors and reducing agents. Heating the mesoporous nanosheets caused them to form amorphous IrOx perforated with a semi-regular arrangement of similar to 13 nm diameter holes. Mesoporous nanosheets have a unique mixture of 2D and 3D topologies that enable superior electrocatalytic activities for the OER, and good stabilities under both acidic and basic conditions.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000475507500009

The crystal structures, morphologies, and compositions of the laser processed Ni-Fe alloys are examined by XRD, XPS and SEM prior and after electrochemical testing. The laser processed Ni6Fe4 alloy exhibits an excellent activity with an OER current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at 464mV overpotential in 1M KOH aqueous solution, which is comparable to the performance of electrocatalysts reported to date.

In this study, we report the use of cobalt-based polyoxometalates (Co-POMs) with an oxo-bridged tetracobalt active site, which is reminiscent of the natural oxygen-evolving complex, as an efficient and stable redox catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries. Interestingly, Co-POMs exhibit catalytic activity for both oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER and ORR, respectively) under a certain condition when it forms a stable dispersion of molecular aggregates, which can be controlled by the types of electrolyte solvents and exposure to light. As a result of the optimized OER/ORR bifunctional activity, Li-O-2 cells facilitated by Co-POM redox reactions successfully achieve improved efficiency and a longer cycle life in comparison to reference cells. The reversibility of the Li-O-2 reactions in the presence of the bifunctional Co-POM catalysts is confirmed by ex situ characterizations.									28	0	0	0	1	0	28			2155-5435			WOS:000441112400042

The crystal structure and the chemical composition were determined with powder X-ray diffraction, electron diffraction, aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray mapping, Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy, iodometric titration, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Being employed as a catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M NaOH, La0.6Ca0.4Fe0.7Ni0.3O2.9 demonstrates a mass activity of similar to 400 A g(oxide)(-1) at 1.61 V vs RHE and a low 52 +/- 2.6 my dec(-1) Tafel slope without noticeable degradation. The superior activity of La0.6Ca0.4Fe0.7Ni0.3O2.9 compared to that of undoped LaFe0.7Ni0.3O3 was rationalized by the comparison of DFT-calculated electronic structures. The Ca doping increases Ni and Fe oxidation states, enhances covalency of the Ni/Fe-O bonds, shifts the center of the O 2p band closer to the Fermi level thus decreasing formation energy of the oxygen vacancies, and activates the lattice oxygen mechanism of the OER, which enhances the catalytic activity. Yet, an optimal balance between stability and activity ensures that the thin and stable active layer of Ni-Fe (oxy)hydroxide is supported by the preserved perovskite structure.									11	1	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000670659900061

However, catalytic activity of current electrocatalysts is usually restricted by high onset potential and limited active sites. Herein, we fabricated three-dimensional (3D) highly ordered mesoporous Pd-Co3O4 composite materials as excellent electrocatalysts for OER in alkaline solution with high activity and stability. Three-dimensional highly ordered mesoporous Co3O4 material was firstly synthesized using mesoporous silica KIT-6 as hard template. Then, Pd-Co3O4 nanomaterials were prepared by a simple reduction method. The as-prepared 3D mesoporous Pd-Co3O4 catalysts have ordered mesoporous structure with a high surface area of 81.0 m(2) g(-1). Three-dimensional highly ordered mesoporous structure can facilitate diffusion and penetration of electrolyte and oxygen. Moreover, the catalysts can also keep catalyst particles in a well dispersed condition with more catalytic active sites. Electrochemical measurements reveal that the 3D mesoporous Pd-Co3O4 catalysts exhibit superior performance in alkaline solution with low onset potential (0.415 V vs. SCE) and excellent long-duration cycling stability.									39	3	0	0	0	0	40			2045-2322			WOS:000392805500001	28134348

The catalytic activity of doped cobalt oxide nanomaterials were observed in potassium hydroxide solution and among all synthesized nanomaterials, the strongest catalytic activity was displayed by cerium doped cobalt oxide-2 nanoparticle in water splitting. Cerium doped cobalt oxide-2 exhibit higher current density at lower over potential and lower Tafel slope as compared to all other studied cobalt based nanomaterials. At 1.0 V, cerium oxide doped cobalt oxide-2 supplied a current density of 39.2 mA/cm(2) in 0.3 M potassium hydroxide solution. Thus cerium doped cobalt oxide-2 exhibit superior electrocatalytic performance and therefore cerium doped cobalt oxide-2 is an attractive finding for superior oxygen evolution in water splitting.									35	0	0	0	4	0	35			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000373742500148

However, their electrochemical processes and fundamental catalytic mechanism remain unclear till now. Herein, in-situ environmental transmission electron microscopy technique was used to study the catalysis mechanism of the Co3O4 nanocubes in SOBs during discharge and charge processes. It is found that during the 1st discharge and charge processes, Na2O2 formed and decomposed, respectively, around the Co3O4 nanocubes, but the following discharge and charge processes were very difficult. In order to promote the charge kinetics, we increased the charging temperature up to 500 degrees C, when the decomposition of Na2O2 became facile. Aberration corrected high-angle annular dark field imaging indicated that a thin layer of CoO grew epitaxially on the surface of Co3O4 nanocubes after the first discharge. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the CoO surface is energetically more favorable than Co3O4 for the nucleation of Na2O2. This study provides not only new fundamental understandings to the electrochemical reaction mechanisms of SOBs, but also strategies to improve the cycling performance of solid state SOBs.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000581738300096

Here, a series of LaNi0.8FexCU0.2-xO3-delta perovskites have been assessed as potential noble-metal-free OER electrocatalysts prepared by sol-gel method. Moreover, the functional role of Cu and Fe amount on the B-site of perovskites for OER electrocatalytic performance was evaluated. LaNi0.8Fe0.2O3-delta materials exhibited the highest intrinsic activities in 0.1 M KOH for OER with an onset potential of 1.56 V, a Tafel slope of 76 mV dec(-1), slightly lower than that of benchmark perovskite-type electrocatalyst Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (BSCF). The above results demonstrate that Cu element in the B-site of perovskites had little effect on the OER performance, and LaNi0.8Fe0.2O3-delta is a potential alternative electrocatalyst for OER application.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1793-2920	1793-7094		WOS:000550797600009

However, its realization in a controllable level remains challenging. Using oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as a model reaction, we report a surface-mediated Fe deposition strategy to electronically tailor surface energy states of porous Co3O4 (Fe-pCo(3)O(4)) for enhanced activity towards OER. The Fe-pCo(3)O(4) exhibits a low overpotential of 280 mV to reach an OER current density of 100 mA cm(-2), and a fast-kinetic behavior with a low Tafel slop of 58.2 mV dec(-1), outperforming Co3O4-based OER catalysts recently reported and also the noble IrO2. The engineered material retains 100% of its original activity after operating at an overpotential of 350 mV for 100 h. A combination of theoretical calculations and experimental results finds out that the surface doped Fe promotes a high energy state and desired coordination environment in the near surface region, which enables optimized OER intermediates binding and favorably changes the rate-determining step.

The catalytic activity can be enhanced by octahedral ions; however, the effects of tetrahedral ions on OER catalysis remain unclear. A study of the effects of tetrahedral ions on OER catalysis was conducted by synthesizing spinel oxides (ZnxCo3-xO4) with various Zn and Co ratios (x = 0-1). Zn0.4Co2.6O4 showed the highest OER activity, although Zn ions have lower catalytic activity than Co ions at both sites. In the structure of ZnxCo3-xO4, it was discovered via Rietveld analysis and X-ray absorption spectroscopy that Zn2+ ions mainly occupy the tetrahedral sites. The highest Zn0.4Co2.6O4 activity is attributed to a moderate amount of cation defects on the surface caused by Zn2+ dissolution; however, excessive Zn2+ ion amounts led to an unstable surface structure. This study elucidates the OER catalysis enhancement attributed to the ion type at tetrahedral sites in spinel oxides. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Here, a KOH activation approach is reported to create abundant defects/vacancies on the porous graphitic carbon nanosphere (CNS) with selective adsorption capability toward transition-metal (TM) ions and innovatively utilize the created defects/vacancies to controllably anchor TM-SAs on the activated CNS via TM-N-x coordination bonds. The synthesized TM-based SAECs (TM-SAs@N-CNS, TM: Cu, Fe, Co, and Ni) possess superior ORR electrocatalytic activities. The Cu-SAs@N-CNS demonstrates excellent ORR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) bifunctional electrocatalytic activities and is successfully applied as a highly efficient air cathode material for the Zn-air battery. Importantly, it is proposed and validated that the N-terminated vacancies on graphitic carbons are the preferable sites to anchor Cu-SAs via a Cu-(N-C-2)(3)(N-C) coordination configuration with an excellent promotional effect toward ORR. This synthetic approach exemplifies the expediency of suitable defects/vacancies creation for the fabrication of high-performance TM-based SAECs, which can be implemented for the synthesis of other carbon-supported SAECs.									24	1	0	0	2	0	24			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000673997300001

However, large-scale applications remain challenging due to their moderate catalytic activity. Optimized regulation of surface states can lead to improvement of catalytic properties. Here, the design of Mn@CoxMn3-xO4 nanoparticles with abundant edge sites via a simple seed-mediated growth strategy is described. The unsaturated coordination generated on the edge sites of CoxMn3-xO4 shells makes a positive contribution to the surface-structure tailoring. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the edge sites with unsaturated coordination exhibit intense affinity for OH- in the alkaline electrolyte, which greatly enhances the electrochemical OER performance of the catalysts. The resulting Mn@CoxMn3-xO4 catalysts yield a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 246 mV and a relatively low Tafel slope of 46 mV dec(-1). The successful synthesis of these metal oxides nanoparticles with edge sites may pave a new path for rationally fabricating efficient OER catalysts.									92	6	0	0	4	0	92			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000411379000015	28745412

However, 2D HEMs have not been reported yet. To find out unique properties of combining 2D materials and HEMs, a series of 2D high-entropy hydrotalcites (HEHs) is created by coprecipitation method, including quinary, septenary, and even novenary metallic elements. It is found that the fast synthetic kinetics of coprecipitation process conquers the thermodynamically solubility limitation of different elements, which is the prerequisite condition to form HEHs. As the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts, HEHs show significantly decreased apparent activation energy compared with low-entropy hydrotalcites (LEHs) due to the lattice distortion induced by the multimetallic character of HEHs. This work opens up a new avenue for the development of 2D HEMs, which broadens the family of HEMs and presents a most promising platform for exploring the unknown properties of HEMs.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000700026900001	34569148

Iridium oxide is well known for its excellent activity and stability during acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, high prices and rare abundance demand the most efficient utilization.We report a new synthesis approach for iridium/titanium-based mixed oxides with a tailored mesopore structure employing iridium acetate and titanium chloride as precursors. The new Ir/TiOx system outperforms OER catalysts based on other titanium precursors by a factor of up to two. The material is used as a model system to investigate the impact of synthesis and structural parameters on OER performance.We find that calcination temperature and iridium content are the main synthesis parameters to achieve tailored structures and superior electrochemical activity. The highest surface area and OER-activity are attained for samples with a fully developed mesoporous network and small crystallite sizes obtained by a moderate calcination around 400 degrees C. A minimum content of iridium is required to achieve sufficient electrical conductivity, whereas at higher iridium content the OER performance scales approximately linearly. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Spinel Co-Mn oxide was used for the catalytic growth of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and the amount of metal species remaining in the CNTs was adjusted by varying the growth time. Gas-phase treatment in HNO3 vapor at 200 degrees C was performed to 1)open the CNTs, 2)oxidize encapsulated Co nanoparticles to Co3O4 as well as MnO nanoparticles to MnO2, and 3)to create oxygen functional groups on carbon. The hybrid demonstrated excellent OER activity and stability up to 37.5h under alkaline conditions, with longer exposure to HNO3 vapor up to 72h beneficial for improved electrocatalytic properties. The excellent OER performance can be assigned to the high oxidation states of the oxide nanoparticles, the strong electrical coupling between these oxides and the CNTs as well as favorable surface properties rendering the hybrids a promising alternative to noble metal based OER catalysts.									29	3	0	0	1	0	30			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000361189400035

To allow an efficient development of such catalysts, activity and durability screening tests are essential. Rotating disk electrode measurements are suitable to determine catalyst activity, while accelerated stress tests on the MEA level are required to evaluate catalyst stability.									63	0	0	0	2	0	64			0009-286X	1522-2640		WOS:000497240000001

In this work, we report the successful synthesis of a new Ni(OH)(2) structure, strain-stabilized Ni(OH)(2) nanoribbons (NR-Ni(OH)(2)) two to three layers thick, with widths of 2-5 nm, via an electro-oxidation route. Conventional Ni(OH)(2) usually has negligible OER activity, while NR-Ni(OH)(2) shows high activity for the oxygen evolution reaction and an overpotential of 162 millivolts and furthermore exhibits long-term stability in alkaline electrolyte. The substantial reduction in the overpotential of NR-Ni(OH)(2) is due to its easier OOH* adsorption by the active four-coordinated Ni edge sites. The enhanced catalytic activity of NR-Ni(OH)(2) makes it an excellent candidate for industrial applications.									47	3	0	0	5	0	49			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000508857600015

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as a sluggish four-electron electrochemical reaction, has to overcome high overpotential to accomplish overall water splitting. Therefore, developing low-cost and highly active OER catalysts is the key for achieving efficient and economical water electrolysis. In this work, Fe-doped NiMoO4 was synthesized and evaluated as the OER catalyst in alkaline medium. Fe3+ doping helps to regulate the electronic structure of Ni centers in NiMoO4, which consequently promotes the catalytic activity of NiMoO4. The overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is 299 mV in 1 m KOH for the optimal Ni0.9Fe0.1MoO4, which is 65 mV lower than that for NiMoO4. Further, the catalyst also shows exceptional performance stability during a 2 h chronopotentiometry testing. Moreover, the real catalytically active center of Ni0.9Fe0.1MoO4 is also unraveled based on the ex situ characterizations. These results provide new alternatives for precious-metal-free catalysts for alkaline OER and also expand the Fe-doping-induced synergistic effect towards performance enhancement to new catalyst systems.									25	0	0	0	2	0	25			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000454705500033	30346644

Generally, the performance of OER catalysts can be significantly improved by synergistic action of the underlying conductive substrate. In this work, a commercial graphite paper was used as a facile substrate with catalytic activity. Graphite paper produced 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 447 mV with a Tafel slope of 62 mV dec(-1). By depositing NiFe hydroxide or Mn oxide film onto the graphite paper, the electrode presented a superior activity for water oxidation, which was believed to be synergistically contributed by their available electrochemically active sites associated with the deposited film and the active substrate. High activities were also accompanied by remarkable durability at large current density levels. Our results illustrated a guideline to the design of inexpensive and highly active composite electrode for water oxidation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we develop a new one-step synthesis strategy of novel composites based on Ni and molybdenum carbide embedded in N- and P-dual doped carbon matrices using mainly chitosan biopolymer as the carbon and nitrogen source, and molybdophosphoric acid (HMoP) as the P and Mo precursor. Two composites have been investigated through annealing a mixture of Ni/chitosan and HMoP with two unlike carbon matrices, melamine and graphene oxide, at a high temperature. Both composites exhibit similar multi-active sites with high electrocatalytic activity for OER in an alkaline medium, which is comparable to the IrO2 catalyst. For this study, an accurate measurement of the onset potential for O-2 evolution has been used by means of a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE).

Recently, metal-organic framework (MOF) derived materials have shown great potential in ORR and OER; however, they may suffer from poor conductivity with limited electrochemical performance especially towards OER. In this work, nickel-cobalt oxides supported on Co/N decorated graphene were prepared by introducing nickel in a zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) as the precursor, which showed improved OER performance due to the as-derived NixCoyO4, and maintained the ORR performance of Co/N doped carbon at the same time. Meanwhile, graphene was utilized to further enhance the electrochemical surface area and charge transfer efficiency. The resulting composites show a potential of 0.796 V at 3 mA cm(-2) and superior stability to Pt/C towards ORR, as well as a potential of 1.629 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) current density for OER, which is much better than that of IrO2. In all, the overvoltage between ORR and OER was just 0.833 V, demonstrating the great potential of the composite in metal-air batteries as a bifunctional oxygen catalyst.									100	6	0	0	3	0	103			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000397605300040

An excellent catalyst should show high catalytic activity for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under different pH conditions. Here, we highlighted a high-efficient catalyst of Ir-doped Ni(OH)(2)nanosheets grown on Ni foam (Ir-Ni(OH)(2)/NF) as a high-efficient catalyst for overall water splitting in both alkaline and neutral conditions via a simple one-step hydrothermal strategy. The optimized Ir-3-Ni(OH)(2)/NF shows superior HER and OER activity in neutral and alkaline electrolytes. The doped Ir ions can not only serve as catalytic sites for water dissociation, but also decrease the charge density of the adjacent bridge oxygen to facilitate HER kinetics. As a result, Ir-3-Ni(OH)(2)/NF electrolyzer exhibits superior performance of a small potential of 1.64 V under neutral condition, which is obviously lower than that of a string of recently reported neutral-pH electrocatalysts.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000568831400001

Synthesized alloy particles are characterized by various physicochemical techniques. TEM and SEM pictures showed homogeneously dispersed alloy nanoparticles on the RGO sheets. Electrochemistry of alloy nanoparticles is investigated in alkaline medium. The result shows that oxygen evaluation reaction (OER) activity of Co3Fe-RGO is higher than Pt -black particles. RDE studies in alkaline medium shows that oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) follow four electron pathway.

Herein, a facile adsorption-pyrolyzation strategy is proposed for preparing ultrafine Ni nanoparticles anchored on carbon nanofiber (Ni/CNF), which derives from pyrolyzation of bacterial cellulose (BC) (with pre-adsorbed of Ni2+) via a two-step heat-treatment proce-dure (firstly 360 degrees C, and then 750 degrees C) (Ni/CNF-750) and used as an excellent oxygen electrocatalyst for flexible all solid-state Zn-air cell. The resultant ultrafine Ni/CNF-750 with plentiful pore structure and rel-atively high specific surface area of 449.0 m(2) g(-1), delivering overpotential of 293 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, obtaining an onset potential of 0.93 V vs. RHE and half-wave potential of 0.76 V vs. RHE for ORR. Moreover, a home-made flexible all solid-state battery is constructed by using Ni/CNF-750 as air electrodes, which provides a power density of 56.8 mW cm(-2) and wonderful cycling durability with maintaining 50 cycles, and can drive a light-emitting-diode (LED) device. Our work may provides a reli-able approach for fabricating ultrafine metal nanoparticles anchored on carbon based substrate with high activity for next-generation energy conversion and storage devices.

Herein, Ni nanoparticles and Mo2C nanoparticles supported on N-doped graphitized carbon (NC) is successfully proposed via an one-step pyrolysis method by employing fish scales derivant as carbon source. The synergistic effects among Ni, Mo2C and NC can increase the active sites, reduce the electrochemical reaction energy barrier, and facilitate the electron transfer. As a result, the proposed optimal catalyst displays higher intrinsic activity (bearing an overpotential of 310 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) toward the oxygen evolution reaction than a benchmark RuO2 electrocatalyst in alkaline electrolyte. Besides, the catalytic performance of hydrogen evolution reaction (bearing an overpotential of 101 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) is close to that of commercial Pt/C in alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, the proposed catalyst can maintain 24 h with stable property, which is very promising for industrial applications. This method of preparing Ni-Mo2C/NC composite electrocatalyst may provide a new route for transforming low-value biomass fish scales into high-value energy conversion materials.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000728655000001

In this study, a series of Fe/ Co-based sulfide nanocomposites were synthesized. The formed Fe/Co-based sulfide product exhibits excellent catalytic OER activity with the overpotential of 283 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH and a Tafel slope of 92.7 mV dec(-1). This catalyst also exhibits an excellent stability with continuous catalysis for at least 50 h; after OER operation for 50 h, the catalytic current density keeps almost constant. As revealed by characterization-contrast of the catalysts before and after OER, the catalyst surface is gradually transformed into MOOH species (M: Co, Fe), which were doped by some oxidized sulfur species. The interactions between Co and Fe, as well as the doping of oxidized sulfur species would optimize the binding state of intermediates (OH, OOH, and O) on cobalt/ iron active sites, inducing the enhancement of catalytic activity. This work provides some insights for the design of sulfide electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000810038000005

The ITO-SAM-Co3O4 (SAM = dicarboxylic acid) are active to electrochemically catalyze oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid. The most active assembly, with Co loading at 3.31 x 10(-8) mol cm(-2), exhibits 374 mV onset overpotential and 497 mV overpotential to reach 1 mA cm(-2) OER current in 0.1 M HClO4. The electron transfer rate constant (k) is acquired using Laviron's approach, and the results show that k is not affected by the carbon chain lengths of the SAM (up to 18 -CH2 groups) and that an increase in the average diameter of Co3O4 nanoparticles enhances the k. In addition, shorter carbon chains and smaller Co3O4 nanoparticles can increase the turn-over frequency (TOF) of Co sites toward OER. The Co3O4 nanoparticles tethered to the ITO surface show both a higher number of electrochemically active Co sites and a higher TOF of OER than the Co3O4 nanoparticles bound to ITO using Nafion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2296-2646			WOS:000850715400001	36092657

After carbonization, the derived NiCo alloy@C/NixCo1-xO/NF hierarchical nanocomposite showed excellent electrocatalytic activity with respect to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER); specifically, it exhibited a very low overpotential of 300 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). The outstanding OER activity of the composite may be attributed to the open structure of the nanocomposite, the formation of the highly dispersed CoNi alloy, and the synergistic interaction between CoNi@C and NixCo1-xO. This work introduces a new strategy for constructing advanced hierarchically structured nanocomposites for diverse applications.									18	3	0	0	1	0	18			2196-0216			WOS:000419269000002

Herein, we report the high-yield chemical exfoliation of Ruddlesden-Popper layered perovskite Sr2IrO4 into protonated colloidal nanosheets with an undamaged perovskite framework. We further demonstrate the potential of protonated perovskite nanosheets to evade the trade-off between OER activity and structural stability. The 2D morphological benefit and nice monodispersity of these protonated perovskite nanosheets enable the facile fabrication of an ultralow-Ir-loading catalyst film (30 mu g cm(-2)), which exhibits about 10 times higher activity than the IrO2 catalyst film and undergoes almost as much Ir leaching during OER. Our joint experimental and theoretical results also reveal that structural hydroxyl groups on the surface of protonated nanosheets participate in the catalytic cycle of OER, and the protonated layered perovskite framework represents an example of OER electrocatalyst that works with a non-traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000830926500001

Herein, we report metallic CuCo2S4 nanosheets (NSs) of atomic thickness as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for use in portable, flexible Zn-air batteries. The metallic CuCo2S4 NSs of atomic thickness with 4-atom-thick to 6-atom-thick layers are confirmed by temperature-dependent electrical resistance measurements and atomic force microscopy. Furthermore, extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy confirms that CuCo2S4 NSs with sulfur vacancies can further increase the OER activity. Due to high electrical conductivity and ultrathin nanosheet structure with abundant defects, CuCo2S4 NSs exhibit excellent reversible oxygen catalytic performance with an overpotential of 287 mV (at j = 10 mA cm(-2)) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and an onset potential of 0.90 V for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Additionally, the portable, flexible Zn-air battery using CuCo2S4 NSs as the air-cathode displays a high open circuit voltage and strong rechargeable capacity for 18 h.

Herein we demonstrate a highly durable and efficient nitride-based bifunctional catalyst consisting of Pt nanoparticles (NPs) and antiperovskite nitride (InNCo2.7Mn0.3). Pt NPs are highly effective for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). InNCo2.7Mn0.3 acts as not only an excellent catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) but also a robust support that can be chemically stable in alkaline media and over the potential range of an air cathode as well. The activity and durability of InNCo2.7Mn0.3 are remarkably enhanced when compared with the commercial Ir/C. As an excellent bifunctional catalyst, Pt/InNCo2.7Mn0.3 enables the Zn-air battery to attain perennial cycling performance over 100 h with high efficiency. The combination of Pt NPs with robust InNCo2.7Mn0.3 nitride is a very prospective replacement for the conventional Pt/ C and Ir/C catalysts for rechargeable Zn-air batteries.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2574-0962			WOS:000543715100025

Herein, porous multishelled Ni2P hollow microspheres assembled by nanoparticles were prepared through a simple and economical self-templating approach followed by phosphorization. Compared with nanoparticles and hierarchical solid interior microspheres, the synthesized multishelled, hollow microstructures of Ni2P exhibit significantly higher electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. Additionally, a NiOOH layer is formed on the surface of Ni2P during anodic polarization, as revealed by electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and in situ Raman analysis. The Ni2P/NiOOH derivative outperforms the benchmark RuO2 in catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction. Furthermore, pairing the carbon fiber paper-supported multishelled Ni2P as both the anode and cathode results in superior overall alkaline water splitting performance, generating 10 and 20 mA cm(-2) current densities at applied cell voltages of only 1.57 and 1.64 V, respectively, together with outstanding durability. These results suggest that further elaboration of the design of multishelled and hollow structured metal phosphides is desirable for application in hydrogen and oxygen evolution electro catalysis.									216	22	0	0	11	0	218			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000412965800056

Moreover, an advanced water electrolyzer based on the Ni3FeN-NPs electrodes as anode and cathode is assembled and could achieve overall water splitting with a cell voltage of 1.81 V at 10 mA/cm(2).

Herein, we successfully enable LaFeO3 coated on nickel foam (denoted LFO@NF) perovskite with impressive OER activity by systematically tailoring the Fe cation sites and the introduction of oxygen vacancies. The cationic site involves dual cation modulation with Cr and Mo, which creates lattice distortions inducing strong electronic interaction, while the anionic site entails reduction via a hydrogen-treatment process, creating oxygen vacancy sites to improve the electronic conductivity of the perovskite oxide. As a result, the optimized LFO-based catalyst, specifically hydrogenated LaFe0.75Cr0.15Mo0.10O3-coated on the nickel foam (denoted H-LFCMO@NF), requires the lowest overpotential of 263 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and has superior kinetics and excellent stability, which are superior to its counterparts. Theoretical analysis also confirmed that the tailoring of the LFO@NF perovskite leads to an increase in the exposure of active sites, optimization of the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates and enhanced electronic conductivity. This work may provide a promising concept to enhance the performance of LFO-based perovskite electrocatalysts for alkaline OER and beyond.									15	1	0	0	1	0	14			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000678743600001

Spinel-structured oxides with rich redox properties can serve as alternative low-cost OER electrocatalysts but with poor HER performance. Here, zirconium regulation in 3D CoFe2O4 (CoFeZr oxides) nanosheets on nickel foam, as a novel strategy inducing bifunctionality toward OER and HER for overall water splitting, is reported. It is found that the incorporation of Zr into CoFe2O4 can tune the nanosheet morphology and electronic structure around the Co and Fe sites for optimizing adsorption energies, thus effectively enhancing the intrinsic activity of active sites. The as-synthesized 3D CoFeZr oxide nanosheet exhibits high OER activity with small overpotential, low Tafel slope, and good stability. Moreover, it shows unprecedented HER activity with a small overpotential of 104 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media, which is better than ever reported counterparts. When employing the CoFeZr oxides nanosheets as both anode and cathode catalysts for overall water splitting, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is achieved at the cell voltage of 1.63 V in 1.0 m KOH.									206	14	0	0	9	0	208			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000477972300016	31148279	
J	Qi, Jianan; Fan, Cuigang; Li, Songgeng								Characteristics of lignite char derived from oxy-pyrolysis								FUEL				291						120261	10.1016/j.fuel.2021.120261		FEB 2021		MAY 1 2021	2021	Lignite chars were prepared in a fixed bed reactor under various oxygen concentrations (0-15 vol%) and pyrolysis temperatures (873 K-1173 K). Characterization techniques such as Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and BET were applied to reveal the impacts of temperature and oxygen concentration on char structure evolution during pyrolysis. Combustion performances of the prepared chars were examined on a thermal gravimetric analyzer, using ignition and burnout temperatures as indexes of char reactivity. On a whole, oxy-pyrolysis char is more reactive than the char derived under inert (N2) atmosphere. Raman analysis indicates that the presence of oxygen during pyrolysis can reduce the extent of char graphitization at high temperatures and favors the removal of oxygen containing groups and aliphatic structures. Pore volume and specific surface area can be improved due to the presence of oxygen in pyrolysis. There is a critical oxygen concentration at high pyrolysis temperatures. Releasing behaviors of sulfur and nitrogen, and their speciation and distributions on the prepared chars were also discussed.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000651782800007

The proposed MCAC network presented nanosheet-like structure, nitrogen-rich, and large specific surface area, which are close to the natures of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) and N-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO), but giving much more defect active sites and regular framework structure. Compared with the g-C3N4, N-rGO and other reported carbon-nitride electrocatalysts, the MCAC nanosheets exhibited a lower overpotential of 1.45 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, along with a higher half-potential of 0.8 V and larger limit current density of -6.0 mA cm(-2) for ORR. Density functional theory calculation revealed that the melem N atoms bonded with cyanurate greatly enhanced the OER activity by increasing the interaction between catalysts and intermediates. Furthermore, as a metal-free electrocatalyst, MCAC displayed superior reversible oxygen electrocatalytic activity, giving a small overpotential difference (0.76 V). The rechargeable zinc-air battery with MCAC as the air electrode in a two-electrode configuration showed a high open-circuit potential of 1.383 V and a specific capacity of 613.5 mA h g(Zn)(-1) at 10 mA cm(-2). This work opens up a new avenue to develop advanced porous solids as metal-free electrocatalysts for the energy storage and conversion applications. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

However, the catalytic activity and stability of oxygen evolution anode are severely limited by the chloride-induced corrosion and competitive oxidation reactions. In this work, we demonstrate an anion-assisted performance improvement strategy by quick and universal screening of electrolyte additive via correlating Cl- repellency with the anionic properties. Particularly, the addition of phosphate ions is found to enable highly stable alkaline seawater splitting at industry-level current density (0.5 A cm(-2)) over 500 h using transition metal hydroxides as anodic electrocatalysts. In situ experiments and theoretical simulations further reveal that the dynamic anti-corrosion behaviors of surface-adsorbed phosphate ions are attributed to three factors including repelling Cl- ions without significantly blocking OH- diffusion, preventing transition metal dissolution and acting as a local pH buffer to compensate the fast OH- consumption under high current electrolysis.

Compared to the traditional steam reforming process, water electrolysis is an innovative method for green hydrogen production. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with slow kinetics limits the efficiency of water electrolysis, thus, the fabrication of efficient and robust electrocatalysts for OER is highly desirable to promote the development of hydrogen industry. Herein, we developed a robust OER electrocatalyst by coupling NiFeOxHy nanosheets with porous nickel (PN) substrate via bubble template method. The NiFeOxHyPN electrocatalyst displays superior electrocatalytic performance, the overpotential for OER at 100 mA cm-2 and 1000 mA cm-2 are 265 mV and 326 mV, respectively. Especially, the NiFeOxHy-PN exhibits better activity and durability than the commercial Raney nickel (RN) in alkaline water electrolysis under industrial conditions, which indicates its potential for industrial application.

Oxygen electrocatalysts based on earth-abundant metals are of prime importance. Trimetallic catalysts have demonstrated reliable activities but their average performance, difficult synthesis techni-ques, and high synthesis costs limit their widespread use. Herein, the facile ball milling technique is introduced as an efficient and low-cost method for the synthesis of catalysts based on trimetallic NiFeCo nanometer-scale particles distributed over a CNT-graphene-like (NiFeCo-NC) structure. NiFeCo-NC is synthesized instantaneously from ball milling of melamine with industrial carbon nanotubes (CNTs) along with trimetallic particles. Results demonstrate that the NiFeCo-NC2 catalyst, synthesized from 2 g of melamine per 1 g of each metal salt, performed well in both ORR and OER. The potential difference between the half-wave reduction potential of the ORR (E-1/2) and the oxidation potential at 10 mA cm(-2) (E-10) in OER reveals a better performance of the NiFeCo-NC2 as a bifunctional catalyst than other syn-thesized materials and reference catalysts. A zinc-air battery (ZAB) having the NiFeCo-NC2 catalyst per-forms better than the batteries using other catalysts. The NiFeCo-NC2 catalyst also exhibits excellent methanol tolerance, revealing its applicability for direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) applications. Ball milling offers a simple, effective, versatile, and cost-effective mechano-chemical procedure for the con-comitant one-pot mixing-synthesis of materials. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, novel CoV-hydroxide nanoneedle arrays with freestanding structure is successfully fabricated as new electrocatalysts for OER. Remarkably, the incorporation of V into Co hydroxide can significantly modulate the nanoneedle morphology, which results in the increase of active surface area, and augment the intrinsic activity by tuning the electronic structure. Particularly, we find that the freestanding Co hydroxide nanoneedles with 25 % Co substituted by V (Co0.75V0.25-HNNs) show the optimum OER catalytic activity and have a low overpotential (268 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), a small Tafel slope (80 mV dec(-1)) and long-term stability, which are comparable to the other Co-based and V-based electrocatalysts for OER reported in literature.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			2196-0216			WOS:000466798700013

In this work, we prepare CoSe2 and (Ni,Co)Se-2 nanocubes by selenylation prussian blue analogues in argon. The (Ni,Co)Se-2 nanocubes exhibits a high specific capacitance of 778 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), which is much higher than CoSe2 nanocubes. Except for excellent pseudocapacitance performance, the (Ni,Co)Se-2 nanocubes show an outstanding electrochemical catalysis ability for the oxygen evolution reaction that achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) only need a low overpotential of 278 mV and exhibits a small Tafel slope. This work successfully add two materials to the growing category of MOF-derivatives and combine the energy storage and conversion, which have a promising potential for further practical application.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			0042-207X			WOS:000498325300011

Here, we developed a bifunctional MnO2/graphene/carbon nanotube that is free of noble metals and that could be a promising candidate electrocatalyst for these oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. It was shown to be able to act as an efficient cathode catalyst for the ORR, having a positive half-wave potential that differs by only similar to 55 mV from that of commercial Pt/C, and a high cathodic current density that is comparable to that of the Pt/C catalyst. Moreover, the hybrid exhibited superior durability with nearly no decay in ORR activity even after 10 000 s of continuous operation in 0.1 M KOH, while Pt/C shows a 20% decrease in the activity. Most importantly, the hybrid was also shown to be highly active for the OER.

However, the reasons for the activity difference of catalysts with multiple morphologies have raised little concern. Herein, we put forward the concept of "active edge perimeter" to evaluate the relative number of active sites. The morphologies are regulated by arranging NH4F from 0 to 3 mmol to prepare microsheet, tight-binding microsheet, hybrid microsheet/wire, long microwire and short wire morphologies. The long-perimeter microsheets can achieve a low Tafel slope (89 mV dec(-1)) and overpotential (283 mV) to reach a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction. For microsheets, the charge-transfer resistance is well under 50 % of the average values. The electrochemical surface area is above average area, owing to the high double-layer capacitance. Therefore, for two-dimensional microsheets, the long active perimeter is the main reason it ensures the high activity required for hierarchical catalysts.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			2196-0216			WOS:000510252300001

Developing efficient and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial and challenging in the overall water splitting process. Herein, we report the synthesis of Ni(PO3)(2)-MoO3 nanorods anchored on nickel foam (Ni(PO3)(2)-MoO3/NF) within a two-step strategy and their application as a bifunctional water splitting electrocatalyst. The results show that the optimal Ni(PO3)(2)-MoO3/NF electrodes exhibit superior catalytic activity with robust durability and ultralow overpotentials of 86 mV for HER and 234 mV for OER to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) ((10)) in alkaline solution. The favorable performance of the obtained catalyst is attributed mainly to the synergetic effect between Ni(PO3)(2) and MoO3, as well as the self-supporting porous conductive substrate. As a result, the integrated Ni(PO3)(2)-MoO3/NF electrodes deliver (10) at a small potential of 1.47 V for overall water splitting, highlighting a promising application as a bifunctional electrocatalyst.									32	1	0	0	0	0	32			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000452490800007	30480300

Herein, CoO nanoparticles embedded into N-doped carbon layers were synthesized by a thermal conversion process of polypyrrole-coated Co3O4 nanoparticles supported on a carbon layer in Ar atmosphere at 900 degrees C. During the process, the initial Co3O4 phase was transformed to the CoO phase along with the thermal carbonization of the polypyrrole layer to the N-doped carbon layer. Owing to the oxidative combustion induced by the O species released from the Co3O4 nanoparticles, the N-doped carbon layer could contain pores around the CoO nanoparticles. Alkaline electrolytes could penetrate the N-doped carbon layer toward the CoO nanoparticles through the pores. The nanocomposites with the well-assembled CoO nanoparticles and porous N-doped carbon layer could exhibit superior catalytic activity for ORR and OER. In addition, the N-doped carbon layers effectively prevent the degradation of the catalyst by protecting the CoO nanoparticles from aggregation during the electrocatalytic processes. The hybrid material of CoO and N-doped carbon showing highly active and durable catalytic characteristics for ORR and OER is a promising electrocatalyst in fuel cells, metal-air batteries, and water-splitting systems and could be used instead of precious metals such as Pt, Ru, and Ir.									27	0	0	0	1	0	27			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000400097100023

Here, we report a simple method to incorporate nickel hexacyanoferrate into the three-dimensional (3D) graphene aerogel (GA) structure (NiHCF/GA), through which we have derived OER active FeNi-P/GA catalyst by heating with the phosphide source. Structural characterization data disclosed that the NiHCF derived FeNi-P particles were uniformly distributed in the 3D GA network. The obtained FeNi-P/GA catalyst exhibits precursor ([K3Fe(CN)(6)] and NiCl2) concentration-dependent electrocatalytic activity towards OER. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) study shows OER on the optimized FeNi-P/GA catalyst surface commenced at 1.46 V vs. RHE and demands only 280 mV overpotential to achieve the benchmark current density of 10 mA.cm(-2).

However, its practical large-scale use critically requires efficient, sustainable and easy-to-operate catalysts that can drive both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the same electrolyte. In this report, we present a facile synthesis of one such electrocatalyst that is composed of amorphous sulfur-bridged iron polyphthalocyanine (FeSPPc) grown in situ on CuxO-coated Cu foam. The material is denoted as FeSPPc/CuxO/CF, where x indicates the non-stoichiometric hybrid valence states of Cu, including its +1 and +2 oxidation states. The as-generated material has unique catalytic sites, large electrochemically active surface area, and high electrical conductivity. It electrocatalyzes the HER in N-2-saturated KOH electrolyte (1 M) with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of only 38 mV. It also electrocatalyzes the OER in O-2-saturated KOH solution (1 M) with 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 350 mV. The material is stable while catalyzing both reactions as well. Importantly, a water electrolyzer assembled using FeSPPc/CuxO/CF as both cathode and anode electrodes in the same alkaline electrolyte requires only 1.48 V to drive the reaction with 10 mA cm(-2) while remaining stable.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2398-4902			WOS:000714167000001

However, these types of air electrodes are problematic because the carbon support can be oxidized to water soluble organic compounds under anodic polarization for a charge process. In this study, we have investigated to use LaNiO3 as a possible electrode material to replace the carbon support because LaNiO3 has both high electric conductivity and high oxygen evolution activity. LaNiO3 was prepared by a reverse homogeneous precipitation method, and then LaMnO3, which is active for oxygen reduction reactions, was successfully loaded onto the LaNiO3 by using a reverse micelle method. LaNiO3 had a much higher stability against anodic polarization as compared to carbon support. The LaMnO3/LaNiO3 composite electrode showed excellent bi-functional oxygen reduction/evolution activity in an alkaline solution and this makes it a highly potential candidate for use in rechargeable metal-air batteries.

In this paper, spinel CoFe2O4/carbon nanotube composites (CoFe2O4/CNTs/FA) were synthesized by solvothermal and calcination method. XRD, TEM, XPS and BET characterizations indicate that the addition of complexing agent fumaric acid can improve the crystal growth kinetics and morphology of CoFe2O4/CNTs nanohybirds. The as-synthesized CoFe2O4/CNTs/FA pyrolyzed at 500 degrees C have an outstanding bifunctional catalytic activity for ORR and OER with the potential of 1.62V (vs. RHE) at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and half-wave potential E-1/2 = 0.808V (vs. RHE) in alkaline electrolyte, respectively. It is obviously better than unloaded CoFe2O4 nanoparticles and commercial CNTs. CoFe2O4/CNTs/ FA also exhibit better methanol tolerance ability and durability than commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalyst. This investigation broadens an idea of simple compounding of spinel with carbon-based materials to improve electrochemical properties.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000598372200003

Herein, we synthesized a novel 1D pea-like nitrogen-doped bimetallic carbide (N-Co6Mo6C) nanorods. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of N doping and good conductivity of the thin amorphous carbon shell on the surface of N-Co6Mo6C, the N-Co6Mo6C shows remarkable activity for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acid and alkaline solution and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution, respectively. Furthermore, using the N-Co6Mo6C as both the anode and the cathode for overall water splitting, a cell voltage of only 1.58 V is needed to derive a current density of 10 mA/cm(2).

Herein, chlorine assisted ion-exchange and in-situ sulfurization processes were combined to construct CuCo2S4@(Cu,Co)(2)Cl(OH)(3) heterostructures from Cu(OH)(2) nanoarrays. Chlorine element in the cobalt source stimulated the formation of (Cu,Co)(2)Cl(OH)(3) precursor, and further facilitated partial transformation of the precursor to CuCo2S4 on the surface to achieve composite structure. The mixed valences of Co element (Co3+ in CuCo2S4 and Co2+ in (Cu,Co)(2)Cl(OH)(3)) and OAS interpenetrated nanointerface in the composite catalysts provided low electron transfer resistance for good alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities. In 1 mol L-1 KOH electrolyte, the overpotentials of the optimal composite catalyst reached 253 and 290 mV respectively at the current density of 20 and 50 mA cm(-2), which is comparable to the activity of commercial Ir/C (281 mV@20 mA cm(-2)).

The oxygen evolution reaction becomes a limitation owing to the multiple electron transfer process. Thereby, a lot of attention is paid on the development of noble-metal free electrocatalysts for boosting the water oxidation process. The heterostructure of Mn3O4 nanoparticles on Cu(OH)(2) nanowire arrays is fabricated, which exhibits an electrocatalytic activity close to RuO2. Compared with the single (hydro)oxides, the largely improved performance of the heterostructure towards water oxidation can be attributed to the enhanced charge transfer by the electronic interaction across the interface and the increased active sites for the rational combination of different active species. This work can be valuable for highlighting the role of heterostructure in the design and development of novel transition metal-based electrocatalysts for water oxidation.									11	0	0	0	0	0	10			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000582482700029

Hydrogen produced by water electrolysis is an ideal energy carrier for potentially scalable storage of these energy sources because it has high energy density and does not emit any pollutant or greenhouse gas upon combustion. However, overall water splitting, including hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (HER and OER, respectively), currently requires a large excess potential to expedite the reactions (200-400 mA cm (2) at cell voltages of 1.8 V-2.4 V in base), resulting in less than 4% of the world's industrial hydrogen being produced by electrolysis. To overcome this obstacle, as well as the high cost of traditional noble-metal catalysts, considerable achievements have been made recently in the development of cheap and earth-abundant electrocatalysts, including some robust catalysts approaching commercial criteria, but reviews of these electrocatalysts and their compatibility with commercial-scale water electrolysis remain lacking. In this review, we will present an overview of recent developments in the production of high-performance earth-abundant and non-noble electrocatalysts for HER and OER, as well as for overall water splitting. With an eye toward the commercialization of water electrolysis, emphasis is placed on the most efficient electrocatalysts for either HER or OER, as well as those showing sustainable capability of withstanding accelerated degradation under large current densities (>= 500 mA cm(-2)) over long periods of time, which is critically indispensable for actual applications of this technology. The major challenges facing the production of such electrocatalysts and possible future improvements in the fabrication of robust electrocatalysts for water electrolysis are also highlighted.

However, their high over-potential during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER) might cause the degradation of the electrolyte and carbon electrodes and result in lower energy efficiency. To solve this problem, N-methyl-N-propyl pyrrolidine bromide (MPPBr), an ionic liquid (IL), was introduced into the electrolyte as a redox mediator (RM). With the presence of MPPBr, the oxidation over-potential was reduced down to about 3.6 V, in which the bromine redox couple (Br-/Br-3(-)) plays the dominant role and is akin to the LiBr RM. Additionally, the MPP+ cation is beneficial for the formation of a stable solid state electrolyte interface (SEI) layer on the surface of Li foil. Having these two virtues, a Li-O-2 battery with 0.2 M MPPBr in 1.0 M LiTFSI-TEGDME delivered a good cycling stability.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463970400027

We utilized a flash nano-precipitation (FNP) synthetic strategy to produce nickel-iron layered double hydroxides with tungstate anions, which simultaneously optimizes the intrinsic and extrinsic activity of the electrocatalyst. The high-valent metal W6+ was introduced into NiFe-LDH in the form of WO42-, which not only increases the diversity of metal species but also optimizes the electronic structure. Furthermore, the flash nano-precipitation synthesis method used changes the morphological structure of the material and thus provides more edge active sites for the oxygen evolution reaction. This led to the fact that NiFe-WO4-LDH prepared from FNP has excellent electrocatalytic activity compared to the pristine materials we prepared. By combining the classical theory of chemical precipitation processes, it can be found that the flash nano-precipitation synthetic strategy can achieve a certain degree of separation of nucleation and growth processes by adjusting experimental parameters. The simple, efficient and scalable flash nano-precipitation synthesis method will provide new routes for metal-based electrocatalyst materials.									34	2	0	0	0	0	34			2398-4902			WOS:000453816900014

Oxygen Evolution Nickel Hydroxide Electrodes in a Ni-MH Battery Prototype								JOURNAL OF NEW MATERIALS FOR ELECTROCHEMICAL SYSTEMS				15	4			277	282						OCT 2012	2012	The effect of cobalt in both alpha and beta phases on the oxygen evolution of nickel hydroxide was studied. The electrochemical properties of the oxygen evolution reaction on the positive nickel hydroxide electrodes were studied under conditions similar to those of a commercial Ni-MH battery. The presence of different kinds of defects in the structure of the active material was determined by XRD methods distorted and asymmetric reflections in the XRD patterns. Both the morphology of the active material and the additives influence the oxygen evolution potential and the electrochemical characteristics. The experimental results showed that the optimized prototype used in this work is suitable for evaluating several electrochemical parameters. It was shown that the electrode without cobalt exhibited the charging efficiency was 94% and those with cobalt exhibited a charging of 98%.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1480-2422			WOS:000326710600008

Transition metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising catalysts and have been intensively investigated especially due to their tunable crystalline structure. Unlike traditional strategies of tuning the morphology of well-crystalline MOFs, low-crystalline bimetallic MOFs are constructed via inducing exotic metal ions, and the formation process is revealed by experimental and theoretical methods. The low crystalline bimetallic MOFs exhibit rich active sites due to local crystallinity and long-range disorder and deliver a small overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 35 mV dec(-1), and a high Faradaic efficiency of 99.5% as oxygen evolution elecctrocatalysts. The work opens up a new avenue for the development of highly efficient earth-abundant catalysts in frontier potential applications.									160	8	0	0	9	0	160			2380-8195			WOS:000456493100040

In this work, heterogeneous NiFe-based oxide/phosphide (NiFe2O4/NiFeP) nanoplates are synthesized on Ni foam using a selective phosphorization process with double crucibles in a muffle furnace. The constructed NiFe2O4/NiFeP heterostructure shows superior catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Impressively, the optimal NiFe2O4/NiFeP heterostructure demonstrates a low overpotential of 191 mV to afford an anodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2)in 1 M KOH, which is better than most of reported OER electrocatalysts. The superior OER activity can be ascribed to the well-configured 3D network structure composed of vertically interlaced nanoplates to provide more exposed active sites and an optimal electronic structure that arises from a synergistic effect between NiFe(2)O(4)and NiFeP to facilitate charge separation and reduce the energy barrier. This selective phosphorization strategy enables rational construction of oxides/phosphides heterostructures with superior OER performance.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2196-0216			WOS:000577632600018

Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been intensively studied for their promising catalytic activities in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this fundamental work, we explored the catalytic properties of TMD family members 2HTaS(2) and 1T TaS2. Our findings reveal that both polytypes exhibit poor HER performance, which is even more pronounced after electrochemical reduction/oxidation. Our experimental data show that 1T TaS2 has a lower overpotential at a current density of -10 mA cm(-1), despite theoretical DFT calculations that indicated that the more favorable free energy of hydrogen adsorption should make "perfect" 2HTaS(2) a better HER catalyst. Thorough characterization showed that the higher conductivity of 1T TaS2 and a slightly higher surface oxidation of 2HTaS(2) explains this discrepancy. Moreover, changes in the catalytic activity after electrochemical treatment are addressed here. For the ORR in an alkaline environment, the electrochemical treatment led to an improvement in catalytic properties. With onset potentials similar to that of Pt/C catalysts, TaS2 was found to be an efficient catalyst for the ORR, rather than for proton reduction, in contrast to the behavior of Group 6 layered TMDs.									26	2	0	0	1	0	26			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000403150100034	28409881

Both carbon derived from phytic acid and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) in composite, enhanced the conductivity and thus improve its electrocatalytical capability. As synthesized Co1.22Ni0.78P2O7-C/RGO composite exhibited excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performances: At the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), only a low overpotential of 283 mV and a small Tafel slope of 51 mV dec(-1) were observed. Good OER catalytic performance was retained even after 10 h continuously running at a constant voltage, which is even comparable to those of first-rate noble metal catalyst RuO2. In addition, the performances of Co2-xNixP2O7-C/RGO catalysts were also strongly dependent on Ni content. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The calculation results show that pristine black (b-As) and gray arsenene (g-As) exhibit poor catalytic performance because of too weak intermediate adsorption. Heteroatom doping plays a key role in optimizing catalytic performance. Among the candidate dopants O, C, P, S, and Sb, O is the most promising one used in arsenene to improve the ORR and OER catalytic performance. Embedding O atoms could widely tune the binding strength of reactive intermediates and improve the catalytic activity. Single O-doped g-As-O(1) can achieve efficient bifunctional activity for both the OER and the ORR with optimal potential gap. b-As-O(1) and b-As-O(2) exhibit the optimal OER and ORR catalytic performance, respectively. For the HER, double C-doped g-As-C(2) could tune the adsorption of hydrogen to an optimal value and significantly enhance the catalytic performance. These findings indicate that arsenene could provide a new platform to explore high-efficiency electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2470-1343			WOS:000656920100018	34056462

Proper defect engineering to tune the surface electronic configuration of electrocatalysts may significantly improve the intrinsic activity. In this work, the selective formation of cation vacancies in NiFe LDHs nanosheets is successfully realized. The as-synthesized NiFe LDHs-V-Fe and NiFe LDHs-V-Ni electrocatalysts show excellent activity for OER, mainly attributed to the introduction of rich iron or nickel vacancies in NiFe LDHs nanosheets, which efficiently tune the surface electronic structure increasing the adsorbing capacity of OER intermediates. Density functional theory (DFT) computational results also further indicate that the OER catalytic performance of NiFe LDHs can be pronouncedly improved by introducing Fe or Ni vacancies.									262	26	0	0	7	0	268			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000430922100025	29611304

Herein, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore the electrocatalytic activity of graphyne nanotubes (GyNTs). Several GyNTs were found to be potential metal-free electrocatalysts, with both HER and ORR activity superior to Pt. Moreover, we revealed a linear relationship between the Gibbs free energy change of O2 adsorption (AGOOH) and binding energy of H adsorption (AEH), which could be attributed to the fact that both the CAO bond of OOH adsorption and the CAH bond of H adsorption are single bonds. Therefore, AEH is proposed as a general descriptor for the rational design of bifunctional graphyne materials toward HERs and ORRs. Our findings provide a simple strategy for the rational design of bifunc-tional materials. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

In this work, CoO/SnO2 nanoparticles were successfully incorporated in nitrogen-doped graphene by a facile method. The composite was of porous structure, and exhibited efficient bifunctional activity and outstanding stability towards both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). For ORR, the catalyst favored a direct four-electron-transfer pathway, and produced kinetic current density values close to those of Pt/C. In addition, for OER, it achieved a lower overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a smaller Tafel slope than RuO2. What is more, the value of the potential difference DE(OER-ORR), a measure of the overall bifunctionality of the catalyst, was 0.72 V, comparable with the values for state-of-the-art nonprecious bifunctional catalysts. The remarkable bifunctional activity of the catalyst was mainly attributed to the synergistic effects between metal oxides and nitrogen-doped graphene.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2046-2069			WOS:000377577800085

Our efforts during the past 6 years in the Priority Program 1613 funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) were focused to mitigate the molecular origin of kinetic overpotentials of Ir-based OER catalysts and to design new materials to achieve that Ir-based catalysts are more atom and energy efficient, as well as stable. Approaches involved are: (1) use of bimetallic mixed metal oxide materials where Ir is combined with cheaper transition metals as starting materials, (2) use of dealloying concepts of nanometer sized core-shell particle with a thin noble metal oxide shell combined with a hollow or cheap transition metal-rich alloy core, and (3) use of corrosion-resistant high-surface-area oxide support materials.

The results show that the formed heterojunction can improve visible light utilization and promote transfer of photo-generated holes from BiVO4 to Bi2O4. Furthermore, the Bi5+ site in the Bi2O4(101) surface is energetically more favorable as the photoanode for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) than the Bi3+ sites in Bi2O4(101) and BiVO4(010). At the same time, it is also found that the Bi5+ in Bi2O4(101) are more stable than the Bi3+ due to the lower surface energy and stronger bond energy with neighbors. Therefore, forming the Bi2O4/BiVO4 heterojunction can effectively improve the activity and stability of BiVO4 for water splitting reactions.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000510729400063	31939946

In this study, spinel NiFe2O4 nanoparticles cross-linked with the outer walls of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were successfully prepared by a simple, scalable hydrothermal method. The as-synthesized NiFe2O4/MWCNT nanohybrid shows not only a better ORR catalytic activity than pure NiFe2O4 and MWCNTs, but also a close four-electron reaction pathway. Meanwhile, the NiFe2O4/MWCNT nanohybrid exhibits a much higher OER catalytic activity when compared to NiFe2O4, MWCNTs and commercial Pt/C in terms of the onset potential and current density. Moreover, the NiFe2O4/MWCNT nanohybrid demonstrates the preeminent long-term durability measured by the current-time chronoamperometric test for both the ORR and OER, which evidently outperforms commercial Pt/C. The excellent bi-functional electrocatalytic activities of the NiFe2O4/MWCNT nanohybrid are attributed to the strong coupling between the NiFe2O4 nanoparticles and the MWCNTs as well as the network structure.									48	4	0	0	6	0	49			2046-2069			WOS:000360860500059

Herein, we report hierarchical Co nanorod arrays (NRAs) incorporated with trace amount of Ir (1.0 at%) (IrCo NRAs), display excellent OER activity, with overpotentials of 257.3, 296.9 and 376.1 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M phosphate buffered saline, respectively. Moreover, the hierarchical IrCo NRAs exhibit extraordinary pH-universal stability. The experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal the dramatic enhancement of OER performance is mainly attributed to the introduction of trace amount of Ir, leading to the modulated morphological and electronic structure as well as reduced OER energy barrier.

Total oxygen evolution is obtained from direct integration. The actual rate of oxygen formation as a function of time, R-o2 (t) not accessible to direct measurement with batch reactors, is calculated from raw data through a simple but comprehensive mathematical model, taking into account mass transfer phenomena occurring in the system. Data concerning the activity of a nanostructured Co3O4 catalyst dispersed on a mesoporous silica (MSU-H), in the presence of tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)Ruthenium [Ru(bpy)(3)](2-) as sensitizer and Na2S2O8 as sacrificial reactant, are used to illustrate data processing. Behaviour of the system is complicated by the occurrence, besides WO reaction, of the degradation of the sensitizer. Increase of sweeping gas flow increases R-o2 (t), by decreasing diffusional limitations to the reactions in the system: conditions for minimizing those were established. Data reported show that the assumption generally made of equilibrium between gaseous and liquid phase through Henry's law is incorrect, the more so the smaller the apparent mass transfer coefficient, k(L)a. An additional reason for removing oxygen from the liquid phase through bubbling is the occurrence of a parasitic reaction of molecular oxygen with the sensitizer. The method seems to yield reliable values of both IcLa and the set of R-o2 (t) values: the former scales with the flow of sweeping gas, as expected; R-o2 (t) curves are in qualitative agreement with accepted reaction mechanisms. Results concerning R-o2 (t) lend support to our previous kinetic studies (M. Armandi et al., ACS Catal, 2013, 3, 1272) where the reaction rate was assumed as constant for the first similar to 15 min.

The prepared sample was characterized by XRD, HRTEM and FESEM. XRD data showed that pure perovskite phase was indeed formed. The results suggested the successful incorporation of Fe3+ at the La3+ cations sites confirming the formation of the orthorhombic perovskite phase of LaFeO3. The particle size calculated from Scherrer equation was found to be 80.56 nm. The orthorhombic phase and the particle size were also ascertained by the HRTEM picture. FESEM image showed a porous and rough surface. Anodic linear polarization was used to evaluate the catalytic activity. The presence of the perovskite modifier increased the electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by about 100 times, the current densities obtained at 1.5 V are 3.6 x 10(-5) and 1.2 x 10(-3) A/cm(2) for unmodified and modified surfaces, respectively. The order of reaction with respect to [H+] is close to unity and the calculated activation energy is 20 kJ/mol, which is much less than the values reported for several catalysts used for OER including some precious metal oxides. EIS results proved the high electrocatalytic activity of LaFeO3 toward OER. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical Society.

The high entropy fluorides were characterized using different techniques, all of which indicate that the high entropy fluorides tend to crystallize into a homogeneously mixed solid solution and single-phase structure. These high entropy fluorides represent an additional class of high entropy ceramics, which have recently attracted attention especially due to the development of high entropy oxides. With the introduction of these novel high entropy fluorides, similar interest could be generated due to the variety of different applications for fluoride materials and the improvements the high entropy concept might bring. Here we present an indepth characterization study and the potential application of high entropy fluorides as a catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction, in which the high entropy fluorides do show increased performance compared to a state-of-the-art catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction, IrO2, despite eliminating noble metal constituents.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000639966100042

However, benchmarking their performance is challenging in many cases, especially at high current densities, which are relevant for industrial applications. Serious complications arise particularly due to (i) the formation of a nonconducting gas phase which blocks the surface during the reactions, (ii) problems in determination of the real electroactive electrode area, and (iii) the large influence of surface morphology alterations (stability issues) under reaction conditions, among others. In this work, an approach overcoming many of these challenges is presented, with a focus on electrochemically formed thin-film oxide electrocatalysts. The approach is based on benefits provided by the use of microelectrodes, and it gives comprehensive information about the surface roughness, catalyst activity, and stability. The key advantages of the proposed method are the possibility of characterization of the whole microelectrode surface by means of atomic force microscopy and an accurate assessment of the specific activity (and subsequently stability) of the catalyst, even at very high current densities. Electrochemically deposited CoOx thin films have been used in this study as model catalysts.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			2155-5435			WOS:000375894500032		
J	Cui, Shufang; He, Yuanchun; Bo, Xiangjie								Prussian blue/ZIF-67-derived carbon layers-encapsulated FeCo nanoparticles for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction								JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				853						113557	10.1016/j.jelechem.2019.113557				NOV 15 2019	2019	In this work, FeCo nanoparticles encapsulated in graphitic carbon layers are derived by direct pyrolysis of Prussian blue/ZIF-67. First, the Prussian blue nanocubes with size of 100-150 nm are selected as cores for growth of ZIF-67 metal organic frameworks. Subsequent direct pyrolysis of Prussian blue/ZIF-67 in nitrogen atmosphere enables the formation of carbon nanospheres with FeCo nanoparticles embedded into the nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon layers. The encapsulation of FeCo nanoparticles into the nitrogen-doped carbon layers favors the electron penetration from the underlying FeCo nanoparticles to the nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon layers, tuning the electron density and the electronic properties at the carbon overlayers and then promoting the both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction activity. By optimizing the ratio between the Prussian blue and ZIF-67, the active and inexpensive carbon layers-encapsulated FeCo nanoparticles achieve high activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction, exhibiting a low overpotential of 106 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) as well as a low Tafel slope of 90.0 mV dec(-1). As oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysts, the carbon layers-encapsulated FeCo nanoparticles deliver an overpotential of 312 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 40.6 mV dec(-1). Severing as both anode and cathode, the carbon layers-encapsulated FeCo nanoparticles show a potential of 1.495 Vat 10 mA cm(-2) for water splitting, which is close to the noble metal benchmarks of Pt/C and RuO2 counterparts. The carbon layers-encapsulated FeCo nanoparticles can be used as an attractive replacement for electrocatalytic water splitting.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000503910000016

Herein, in-situ growth of uniform nanosheet arrays on nickel foam (NF) is hydrothermally achieved by varying feed ratios of Fe(III)and Ni(II)salts. The feed ratio of the two active metals has significantly dominated both the morphological and electronic structures of the resultant electrocatalysts, leading to feed ratio-dependent volcano-type OER activity. The optimized Fe0.89Ni0.11-BDC/NF exhibits the best OER performance, affording a low overpotential of 220 mV to drive a current density of 50 mA center dot cm(-2)with small Tafel slope of 44.8 mV center dot dec(-1)and long-lasting stability over 20 hours. The synergistic effect from the Fe(III)and Ni(II)species on both the morphological and electronic structure modulations have dramatically accelerated the reaction kinetics, responsible eventually for the enhanced OER activity. This work provides valuable information for nanostructured MOFs as efficient electrocatalysts.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0044-2313	1521-3749		WOS:000565636700001

Considering the high activity of CoS for OER and the superionic conductor characteristics of Ag2S, Co-Ag sulfide catalyst was synthesized by a simple solvothermal method. Small amounts of Ag2S species in the reaction system mediates the formation of CoS nanowires, which is in contrast to irregular particles obtained without Ag2S. Ag2S species with superionic conductor characteristics acing as a catalyst induces the growth of CoS nanowires via a non-typical solution-liquid-solid mechanism. The thus formed Ag+ mediated CoS nanowires show improved electrical conductivity and prominent catalytic activity, and only requires an overpotential of 293 mV to provide a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with Tafel slope of 55.3 dec(-1). In addition, the catalytic activity can maintain in the i-t WA for at least 30 h. The derivation of this OER catalyst after OER operation was examined, which indicates that Ag- and S- codoped CoOOH is formed on the catalyst surface after OER operation that acts as catalytic active phase for OER.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000531747600005

In this work, we developed a facile low-temperature coprecipitation approach to synthesize NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH). By tuning Ni/Fe feed ratio and using Na2CO3 as precipitant, mesoporous NiFe LDH nanoparticles were obtained. The special physicochemical features of these NiFe LDH nanoparticles, including high degree of crystallization, large pore volume and abundant crystalline/amorphous interfaces, synergistically endowed the catalyst with enriched active sites. Consequently, the optimal Ni0.66Fe0.33 LDH electrocatalyst showed excellent activity toward OER in alkaline media, with a low overpotential of 248 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 46 mV dec(-1), and strong durability. This work opens an innovative avenue toward the design of advanced NiFe-based catalysts.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000570089000003

For further development of highly OER active perovskite oxides, however, the exact mechanism the OER must be well understood. Herein, we introduce investigation of the OER mechanism of perovskite oxides by ab initio analysis based on well-defined model systems of LaMnO3 (LMO), LaCoO3 (LCO), and La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 (LSCO). In addition, we have systematically conducted electrochemical experiments from which we have observed an increasing trend in the OER activity in the order of LSCO > LCO > LMO based on the cyclic voltammetry (CV) results obtained in the alkaline medium. To validate the experimental results, free-energy diagrams have been constructed for oxygen intermediates on the surface of the defined models to find the limiting step by changing the B site atom (e.g., Mn and Co) and the partial displacement of Sr atoms in La site. The oxygen adsorption energy of perovskite oxides is found to increase with decreasing number of outer electrons as well as upshifting of the position of the d(z)(2) orbital toward the Fermi level of B site element. This work demonstrates that highly active OER perovskite oxides can be obtained by modifying the chemical composition to finely tune the oxygen adsorption energy on the catalysts surface, confirmed by synergetic approaches of using both experimental and ab initio computational studies.									97	4	0	0	3	0	98			2155-5435			WOS:000357626800052

Both oxidation and reduction peaks for Ni in the presence and absence of Fe are linearly changed by (scan rate)(1/2). Immediately after the interaction of [FeO4](2-) with the surface of the electrode, a significant increase in OER is observed. This could be indicative of the fact that either the [FeO4](2-) on the surface of Ni oxide is directly involved in OER, or, it is important to activate Ni oxide toward OER. Due to the change in the Ni(II)/(III) peak, it is hypothesized that Fe impurity in KOH or electrochemical cell has different effects at the potential range. At low potential, [FeO4](2-) is reduced on the surface of the electrode, and thus, is significantly adsorbed on the electrode. Finally, oxygen-evolution measurements of K2FeO4 and Ni2O3 are investigated under chemical conditions. K2FeO4 is not stable in the presence of Ni(II) oxide, and OER is observed in a KOH solution (pH approximate to 13).									27	0	0	0	2	0	27			2045-2322			WOS:000560076900007	32472099

Many of these hierarchical structures resemble shapes from Nature, demonstrating much improved physico-chemical properties. Yet, their rational design and controlled synthesis remain challenging. By simply manipulating (electro)chemical gradients using a combined hydrothermal and electrodeposition strategy, we herein show the controlled growth of Co(OH)2 nanostructures, mimicking the process of garden cultivation. The resulting ldquonano-gardenrdquo can selectively contain different patterns, all of which can be fully phosphidated into CoP without losing the structural integrity. Remarkably, these CoP nanostructures show distinct catalytic performance in oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions. Under pH-universal conditions, the CoP ldquosoil + flower-with-stemrdquo structure shows a much more ldquoeffectiverdquo surface area for gas-evolving reactions with lower activation and concentration overpotentials. This provides superior bifunctional catalytic activity for both reactions, outperforming noble metal counterparts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488			INSPEC:20883585

The morphology of the deposits varied significantly with the concentration of the surfactant but all are made up of aggregated nanoparticles circa 9 nm in diameter. The deposits from the micellar phase of the surfactant offer the largest electroactive area and specific activity for the hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution and reduction reactions and formic acid and ethanol oxidations. Unexpectedly the deposits lead to an increase in catalytic activity far in excess of that expected from an enhancement in electroactive area.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000332393200050	24473092

Herein, the MoSe2/MoO3 and WSe2/WO3 based different shaped nanohybrids were prepared in a new, economic and creative way by adjourning the complete 24 h hydrothermal reaction for 30 min at an interval of 3 h. By optimizing the temperature and adjourning time different shape of MoSe2/MoO3 and WSe2/WO3 were prepared and from them four specific shapes nanohybrids i.e. MoSe2/MoO3-1 (150 degrees C) Marigold like flower, MoSe2/MoO3-2 (200 degrees C) thin rod agglomerated flower, WSe2/WO3-1 (150 degrees C) rhombic dodecahedron, WSe2/WO3-2 (200 degrees C) nanorod, were selected to explore their trifunctional electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER, ORR, HER). The shape-specific trifunctional electrochemical study was performed over the prepared nanohybrids and it was observed that flower-shaped MoSe2/MoO3-2 nanohybrid having thin and small rod-like petals shows the best performances with smallest OER onset potential=1.1 V, high current density=350 mA cm(-2) and small OER Tafel slope of 45 mV/dec. The prepared catalyst also shows very good ORR property with more positive onset potential of 930 mV and Tafel slope of 32 mV/dec. Beside OER and ORR the catalyst shows good HER behavior, due to its small thread like active hydrogen evolution site and exhibit very low onset potential of -0.085 V with low overpotential value of 270 mV and low Tafel slope of 27 mV/dec. The prepared catalyst is free from any methanol cross-over effect and shows good durability and stability, under various extreme conditions. In addition, MoSe2/MoO3-2 based zinc-air battery has also been prepared, which shows an outstanding performance and proves their potential for energy storage and conversion based devices.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000397314200011

However, their role in the catalysis is not fully understood although most studies conclude that the coupling between the carbon support and catalyst could reduce the charge transfer resistance and improve the kinetics of catalytic reactions such as water splitting. In this study, a carbon-modified FeP2 electrocatalyst with a one-step strategy is synthesized. The tensile strain is introduced in situ in the ab crystal plane of the FeP2 catalyst. This leads to charge redistribution between H and O atoms in the OH bonds and enhances the adsorption of reaction intermediates. In the water oxidation process, this results in a decrease in the energy barrier for the rate-determining step, specifically, the chemical step of *OH adsorption preceded by one-electron transfer. Benefiting from the optimized adsorption energy, the strained catalysts exhibit excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with a low overpotential in addition to their increased stability. This study provides a new strategy for the introducing of strains in functional materials and provides new insights into the influence of carbon modification on OER activity.									35	2	0	0	2	0	35			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000508509400001

In this work, with the aid of our pre-designed cor-relation factor of d electron density, a new oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst of FeCoPO4 was designed on account of the higher electronegativity of Co atom than Fe atom. The foreign Co atom would enhance the combining capacities of the neighbouring Fe-O bonds, increase the d electron density and reduce the chemical activity of host Fe ions, and thus improve the catalytic activity of Fe based active centers. Based on the theoretical guidance, the prepared FeCoPO4 specimen exhibited low eta exp of 241 mV, fast charge transfer rate, high intrinsic activity and stable electrocatalytic activity. This strategy would be adopted to design highly-efficient catalyst by altering the d electron density of transition metal ions with suitable preparation methods.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000810446300005

Herein, we report a NiMoP@NiFe-LDH heterostructure electrode supported on nickel foam. The study shows that the electrocatalytic activity for the OER can be improved by coupling NiMoP and NiFe-LDH. The resulting NiMoP@NiFe-LDH heterostructure exhibited remark-able catalytic performance with an ultralow overpotential of only 299 mV at a current density of 150 mA cm-2 and a Tafel slope of 23.3 mV dec-1 in 1.0 M KOH solution. Electron transfer from NiFe-LDH to NiMoP at the nanointerface reduces the energy barrier of the catalytic process, thus improving the OER activity performance.

Herein, an etching and pyrolysis strategy is employed to dope Ru into highly hollow nanocaged RuCo@C heterostructured catalysts using the metal-organic framework ZIF-67 as a template by adjusting the annealing temperature, which not only enhances the activity but also reduces the cost. Property studies show that the optimal heterostructured catalyst RuCo@C-350 presents outstanding electrocatalytic activities with low overpotentials to drive 10 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, 91 mV) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER, 230 mV) under alkaline conditions. Moreover, RuCo@C-350 demonstrates remarkable catalytic behavior for overall water splitting in a two-electrode system with 1.56 V to drive a 10 mA cm(-2) current density in an alkaline electrolyte. The derived highly hollow heterostructure that exposes numerous active centers and accelerates the mass transportation and the strong synergistic coupling effect between the integrated components together improve the catalytic activity and stability of the composite catalyst. This work promotes an in-depth understanding of the rational construction of MOF template-induced bifunctional Ru-based electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1466-8033		WOS:000802017600001

To address this issue, spinel-type MnCo2O4.5 nanoparticles (NPs) prepared by a solvothermal method followed by calcination were characterized by a range of instrumental techniques and employed in rechargeable Zn-air batteries to promote the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. The bifunctional activity of the MnCo2O4.5 NPs was further evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry, which showed that both the reduction and oxidation current densities obtained in the presence of this catalyst exceed those observed with catalyst-free carbon. Moreover, the incorporation of the MnCo2O4.5 NPs into an air-breathing cathode resulted in a decreased charge-discharge voltage gap and improved round-trip efficiency. Therefore, these MnCo2O4.5 NPs are a highly beneficial and novel kind of bifunctional electrocatalyst for rechargeable Zn-air batteries.[GRAPHICS].									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000534732000001

Herein, we report the synthesis of a crystalline multimetal (Co, Ni, Fe) nanosheets array (NSA) enriched with oxygen vacancies by a simple electrosynthesis method, which can serve as efficient and stable electrocatalysts for both OER and HER The oxygen vacancies are generated by electro-oxidation or electro-reduction of CoFeNiSe precursor via the replacement of selenium by oxygen. For HER, as synthesized CoFeNi-NSA achieved a 400 mA cm(-2) current density at a low overpotential of -211 mV. For OER, CoFeNi-NSA was in situ oxidized to form CoFeNiO-NSA, which achieved a 400 mA cm(-2) current density at a low overpotential of 270 mV. The activities of CoFeNi-NSA and CoFeNiO-NSA remained stable after 150 h HER or OER test at high current densities, showing higher activity and stability than noble-metal electrocatalysts Pt/C and IrO2, respectively. The electrolytic cell of CoFeNiO-NSA parallel to CoFeNi-NSA can achieve a high current density of 400 mA cm(-2) at a moderate voltage of 1.98 V. During a long-term water splitting test, the voltage of the electrolytic cell remained stable at 1.76 V for 150 h at a current density of 120 mA cm(-2), indicating that these catalysts have both high activity and stability for OER and HER reactions.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2574-0962			WOS:000504953500065

To break down aggregated particles, the samples were milled in alcohol at 400 rpm for 1 h. According to Rietveld refinements and transmission electron microscopy, the samples had crystallite and particle sizes in the range of 36-53 nm and 44-147 nm, respectively, confirming the as-prepared samples in a nanoscale. X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement confirmed that the samples are single phase. In addition, Mossbauer spectroscopy analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed the mixed spinel composition. Besides, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed surface oxygen vacancies, given by ratio areas between oxygen vacancies (O-V) and oxygen in the lattice (O-L), of 0.63, 0.27 and 0.10 for NiFe2O4, CuFe2O4 and CoFe2O4 powders, respectively. Magnetic measurements showed ferrimagnetic behavior for all samples. Toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), copper-oxygenated groups on the CuFe2O4 nanoparticle surface may play an important role, once CuFe2O4 showed superior electrocatalytic performance, with overpotentials of 369 mV (CuFe2O4) < 386 mV (NiFe2O4) < 448 mV (CuFe2O4) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slopes of 76.3 mV dec(-1) (CuFe2O4), 85.7 mV dec(-1) (NiFe2O4) and 148.1 mV dec(-1) (CuFe2O4).

The distribution of lithium during the delithiation process was simulated based on the density functional theory calculations of the energy required to remove the lithium from the surface or bulk crystal of lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NCM) and lithium cobalt oxide (LCO). Lithium coverage of the surface was smaller for LCO than NCM at a highly charged state. The energy required to form an oxygen vacancy in NCM and LCO crystal was also calculated. The results showed that LCO was more apt to emit oxygen than NCM as the delithiation percentage was increased. The results suggest that the gas-generating side reactions related to the emission of oxygen would be more significant for LCO with high voltage charging. Experimental result showed a considerable portion of the gas was generated at the initial stages of storage for NCM, whereas LCO showed slow but steady gas evolution with increasing storage time. A large amount of Li2CO3 or LiOH on the surface of NCM appears to cause an immediate gas-generating side reaction, whereas LCO produces slow side reaction related to the emission of oxygen from the LCO material itself.									8	2	0	0	0	0	10			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000342453000024

Benefiting from the optimized electronic structure and enhanced mass and charge transport, as well as the 3D conducting pathway, MoxCoy@N-CNSs/CNTs shows superior performance towards both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline medium. The optimal electrocatalyst is Mo2Co1@N-CNSs/CNTs, which reveals a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the low overpotentials of 99 mV and 300 mV for the HER and OER, respectively, and a relatively low cell voltage (1.63 V) for the overall water electrolysis.

Owing to the fiber structure, a binder is not needed to fabricate the electrode, which eliminates the possibility of side reactions associated with a binder. It was demonstrated that the hollow tubular structure with a large inner diameter is highly effective for accommodating a substantial amount of discharge products without hindering the mass transfer of reactants, even under the fully discharged condition. The reversibility and rate capability were improved by optimizing the length of the fiber. The nitrogen-doped carbon reduced the overall overpotential between the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. Therefore, the nitrogen-doped hollow carbon fiber can be used to obtain a highly effective oxygen electrode for Li-O-2 batteries.

The development of energy-saving electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by replacing the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a thermodynamically favorable electrochemical oxidation (ECO) reaction has attracted increasing attention. In this study, a self-supported, hierarchical, porous, nitrogen-doped carbon (NC)@CuCo2Nx/carbon fiber (CF) is fabricated and used as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for both HER and OER in alkaline solutions with excellent activity and stability. Moreover, a two-electrode electrolyzer is assembled using the NC@CuCo2Nx/CF as an electrocatalyst at both cathode and anode electrodes for H-2 production and selective ECO of benzyl alcohol with high conversion and selectivity. The excellent electrocatalytic activity is proposed to be mainly due to the hierarchical architecture beneficial for exposing more catalytic active sites, enhancing mass transport. Density functional theoretical calculations reveal that the adsorption energies of key species can be modulated due to the synergistic effect between CoN and CuN. This work provides a reference for the development of high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts for simultaneous production of H-2 and high-value-added fine chemicals.									167	12	0	0	9	0	168			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000417187200021

Herein, a new bifunctional electrocatalyst Co/BCTs is exploited via in-situ growth of metallic Co particles on/in the surface of biomass carbon tubes (BCTs) derived from available natural cotton fibers, which exhibits the outstanding electrocatalytic performance for OER, HER and overall water-splitting. It is because that the mordification effect of Co particles improves conductivity, facilitates electron transfer and activates surface of BCTs, and meanwhile the unique micro-structure and morphology of Co/BCTs can promote the molecular mass transport and shorten the molecular diffusion distance. As expected, the electrolyzer assembled by Co/BCTs-5 as electrode couple attains a very low potential of 1.40 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting in alkaline electrolyte. This work endows new opportunities and potential values for exploiting the high-efficiency noble-metal-free electrocatalysts originated from natural biological derived materials.

Oscillatory passive active transition during the corrosion in nickel chromium layer systems								JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE ELECTROCHEMISTRY				17	2	SI		489	496		10.1007/s10008-012-1949-3				FEB 2013	2013	The electrochemical corrosion of the porous layer system nickel/chromium was investigated combining classical open circuit measurements, cyclic voltammetry, and zero-resistance Ammeter experiments. Under moderate conditions as there are low chloride concentration, pH 6, and high oxygen content the nickel layer acts as sacrificial anode, whereas at the chromium top layer oxygen reduction takes place. Under conditions of limited access of oxygen into pores potential oscillations occur which indicates a change of corrosion mechanism. Thereby the anode reaction changes between nickel and chromium dissolution. The respective cathode reaction is oxygen reduction or hydrogen evolution. The modeling of the potential oscillation reveals the character of the potential-dependent Flade potential as function of the proton concentration.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000313800200024

Recently, LSCFs have been studied as the cathode of lithium air batteries at low temperature due to superior electrocatalytic activity. In the case of low-temperature applications, LSCF exhibits low catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), despite its relatively good activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the activity on ORR is still a barrier to LSCF being utilized as a catalyst for low-temperature electrochemical devices such as lithium air battery. In this work, different palladium (Pd) contents were deposited on the LSCF surface to improve its ORR activity as a promising bifunctional catalyst in lithium air batteries. Thus, Pd was modified on the LSCF surface and structural and electrochemical characteristics were evaluated. Pd nanostructure can be successfully deposited on the LSCF surface, and the ORR catalytic activity was improved. Furthermore, the capacity in lithium air batteries is 4467 mA h and the cycling performance is improved using optimized LSCF with 20 wt % Pd as potential bifunctionalistic cathode materials. The present results show that the deposition of Pd is an effective approach to enhance the ORR activity of perovskite LSCF.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2574-0962			WOS:000458706600046

The as-prepared Co-B/NF can act as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The catalyst affords a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at 265 mV overpotential during the OER in 1.0 M KOH solution, ranking it among the best reported nonprecious OER electrocatalysts. This strategy for constructing electrocatalysis electrodes prevails over the conventional method of drop-coating metal boride dispersions on the electrode, having better intrinsic stability and fully exposed active site surfaces. Given the low cost, ease of fabrication, good controllability, and high OER electrocatalytic activity and stability, Co-B/NF has great potential as a high-performance anode catalyst for water splitting.									35	3	0	0	0	0	36			2196-0216			WOS:000477961200016

Herein, the synthesis of a series of hierarchical hollow nanoplates (NPs) composed of ultrathin Co(3)O(4)nanosheets doped with 13 different metal atoms is reported. The synthesis involves a cooperative etching-coordination-reorganization approach starting from zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) NPs. First, metal atom decorated ZIF-67 NPs with unique cross-channels are formed through a Lewis acid etching and metal species coordination process. Afterward, the composite NPs are converted to hollow Co(3)O(4)hierarchical NPs composed of ultrathin nanosheets through a solvothermal reaction, during which the guest metal species is doped into the octahedral sites of Co3O4. Density functional theory calculations suggest that doping of small amount of Fe atoms near the surface of Co(3)O(4)can greatly enhance the electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Benefiting from the structural and compositional advantages, the obtained Fe-doped Co(3)O(4)hierarchical NPs manifest superior electrocatalytic performance for OER with an overpotential of 262 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 43 mV dec(-1), and excellent stability even at a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2)for 50 h.									212	7	0	0	10	0	214			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000543132200001	32588509

The electrocatalysts were prepared by the ethylene glycol method. Physicochemical characterization was carried out by X-ray Diffraction, Transmission Electronic Microscope and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, meanwhile rotating ring-disk electrode and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were employed to determine the electrochemical activity and stability. Results reveal the highest activity toward oxygen reduction and evolution reactions on TiCN-based materials, in addition to the best compromise between catalytic activity and stability. In this context, nitrogen loading appears to be an important factor for the catalyst performance and noble metal anchoring. It is observed an increment of particle agglomeration with nitrogen content in the catalyst support. Also, TiN-based catalyst presents the lowest noble metal inclusion and high passivation degree by dissolved oxygen; whereas TiC and TiCN based catalysts develop an anodic peak at ca. 1.1 V, which is associated to TiO2 and CO2 formation.

The incorporation of small amount of Pd nanoparticles leads to a substantial increase in the electrocatalytic activity and stability of the LSM-GDC oxygen electrodes. The electrode polarization resistance (R-E) at 800 degrees C on a 0.2 mg cm(-2) Pd-infiltrated LSM-GDC electrode is 0.13 Omega cm(2), significantly smaller than 0.42 Omega cm(2) for the reaction on the pure LSM-GDC electrodes. The overpotential loss is also substantially reduced after the Pd infiltration; at an anodic overpotential 50 mV and 800 degrees C, the current increases from 0.15 A cm(-2) for the pure LSM-GDC anode to 0.47 A cm(-2) on a 0.3 mg cm(-2) Pd-infiltrated LSM-GDC. The infiltrated Pd nanoparticles enhance the stability of the LSM-GDC oxygen electrodes and are most effective in the promotion of the diffusion, exchange and combination processes of oxygen species on the surface of LSM-GDC particles, leading to the increase in the oxygen evolution reaction rate.

The composite material demonstrated excellent bifunctionality before and after long periods of cyclic voltammetry cycling. After cycling, the oxygen reduction current density of the composite shows about 4, 34 and 3 times improvements in comparison to multi-walled carbon nanotube, cubic spinel cobalt oxide and their physical mixture, respectively. The oxygen evolution current density of the composite was 49% higher than the physical mixture and even greater than each component alone after 500 CV cycles. The cause of high performance is presumably contributed to the synergistic coupling effects between the multi-walled carbon nanotubes and the cubic spinel cobalt oxide. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, nanostructured amorphous Fe29Co27Ni23Si9B12 HEA ribbon is fabricated via a melt spinning method combined with electrochemical corrosion etching process, which is applied as the potential oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst. It is found that there are micro/nano pits on the surface of etched amorphous Fe29Co27Ni23Si9B12 ribbons. Various elements of HEAs bond with each other to form a highly disordered configuration, which could result in an optimized bonding energy and enhanced intrinsic catalytic activity. The electrocatalysis activity measurements indicate that the amorphous HEA endows a much higher activity than the crystalline one, which is further improved by the electrochemical etching treatment. Especially, the HEA ribbon etched for 3 h requires a low overpotential of 230 mV to afford 10 mA cm(-2) current density. In addition, density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the amorphous structure can weaken the interaction between the surface of Fe29Co27Ni23Si9B12 alloy and the intermediates, leading to an optimized adsorption Gibbs free energy.

J	Zeng, Dewang; Li, Yanzhi; Zhang, Zhenwu; Luo, Chen; Liu, Tong; Kong, Qingfeng; Xiao, Rui								Bulk oxygen conduction kinetics of iron oxides on the chemical looping combustion								FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY				237											DEC 1 2022	2022	Oxygen-ion conduction is generally considered the rate-determining step during the chemical looping combustion process, which is vital for the design of the oxygen carriers. However, the redox reaction is heavily influenced by gas diffusion, making it very difficult to derive convincing intrinsic kinetic data. This work aims to establish a methodology to evaluate the intrinsic kinetics of oxygen carriers for chemical looping combustion by using an ultra-thin oxygen conducting membrane to exclude the influence of gas diffusion. From mass balance and Fick's second law, a mathematical kinetics model describing the intrinsic oxygen conduction performance was established. The intrinsic activation energy took value of 77.84 kJ/mol for pure Fe2O3. The kinetics parameters can be used for the high throughput design and screening of oxygen carriers.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-3820	1873-7188		WOS:000863994700003

Herein, utilizing thermodynamically metastable Ti atoms on the Ti(3)C(2)Tx MXene nanosheet surface as the nucleation site, oxygen vacancy-rich TiO2 nanoparticles were in situ fabricated on Ti(3)C(2)Tx nanosheets (V-TiO2/Ti(3)C(2)Tx) and used as the oxygen electrode of Li-O-2 batteries. Oxygen vacancy (Vo) can boost the migration rate of electrons and Li+ as well as act as the active sites for catalyzing the ORR and OER Based on the above merits, V-TiO2/Ti(3)C(2)Tx-based Li-O-2 battery shows improved performance including the ultralow overpotential of 0.21 V, high specific capacity of 11 487 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1), and excellent round-trip efficiency (93%).

Such a system assures well-defined active centers, maximum atom utilization efficiency, and hence enhanced selectivity, catalytic activity, and stability. Herein, a comprehensive investigation of the electrocatalytic activity of iron-doped cobalt oxide (Fe-Co3O4) nanosheets is presented. In order to understand the contribution of dopants, a series of materials with controlled doping levels are investigated. By controlled iron inclusion into the structure of Co3O4, an apparent improvement in the oxygen evolution reaction activity which is reflected in the decrease of 160 mV in the overpotential to reach the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) is manifested. Additionally, it is shown that there exists an optimum doping content above which the catalytic activity fades. Further investigation of the system with density functional calculations reveals that, along with the optimization of adsorption energy toward the reaction intermediates, substantial downshift of the Fermi level and delocalization of electron density occurs on introducing iron ions into the structure.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000493869700027	31595745

Using the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) to replace OER has been an energy-saving approach for its lower electrode potential, and also a potential approach for wastewater treatment. In this paper, novel materials of MoP@NiCo-LDH/NF-x(x= 10, 20, 30 minutes) are synthesized and explored as bifunctional catalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode and the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) or the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anodes of urea-water or water electrolysis. The morphologies and compositions of such catalyst materials are characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The catalytic activity and stability are measured by linear sweep voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, chronoamperometry,etc.The results indicate that MoP@NiCo-LDH/NF-20 has better catalytic performance, and can be used as a bifunctional catalyst for both HER and OER/UOR in the electrolysis. A two-electrode electrolyser (MoP@NiCo-LDH/NF-20||MoP@NiCo-LDH/NF-20) is constructed. At 100 mA cm(-2), the two-electrode electrolyser needs only 1.405 V, while the precious metal electrolyser Pt/C/NF||IrO2/NF needs 1.697 V at the same current density, indicating that MoP@NiCo-LDH/NF-20 could be a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst in water and urea-water electrolysis for the treatment of urea wastewater and hydrogen production.									52	1	0	0	0	0	52			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000569873400018

Herein, we have developed a metal-free pyrene-based nitrogen and sulfur containing conjugated microporous polymer having a high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area (761 m(2) g(-1)) and a low bandgap of 2.09 eV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution. The pi-conjugated as-synthesized porous organic material (PBTDZ) has been characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), solid-state C-13 (cross-polarization magic angle spinning-nuclear magnetic resonance) CP-MAS NMR, N-2 adsorption/desorption analysis, field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments. The material acts as an efficient catalyst for photoelectrochemical OER with a current density of 80 mA/cm(2) at 0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl and delivered 104 mu mol of oxygen in a 2 h run. The presence of low bandgap energy, pi-conjugated conducting polymeric skeleton bearing donor heteroatoms (N and S), and higher specific surface area associated with inherent microporosity are responsible for this admirable photoelectrocatalytic activity of PBTDZ catalyst.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2296-2646			WOS:000743989500001	35004623

The developed oxygen electrode extends the oxygen evolution reaction from the electrolyte/electrode interface to the oxygen electrode, thus improving the performance of the LSM-based oxygen electrode. At 800 degrees C and with 40% relative humidity (RH), the polarization resistance of the LSM/SDC-CuO based SOEC (0.89 Omega cm(2)) is lower than that of the LSM-based SOEC (1.73 Omega cm(2)) and LSM/SDC-based SOEC (1.35 Omega cm(2)) under open circuit voltage, and the current density of the LSM/SDC-CuO based SOEC can reach 0.36 A cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.5 V, which is significantly higher than that of the LSM-based SOEC (0.23 A cm(-2)) and LSM/SDC-based SOEC (0.24 A cm(-2)). Moreover, the LSM/SDC-CuO based SOEC shows good stability. Therefore, this method is feasible for improving the performance of LSM-based oxygen electrodes in intermediate-temperature SOECs.									11	2	0	0	0	0	12			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000460492200172

Recently, nanostructured cobalt carbonate hydroxide has been regarded as one of the attractive candidates for electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolytes owing to its low price, chemically versatile structure, and high durability. Nevertheless, the industrial utilization of cobalt carbonate hydroxide for water splitting is hin-dered by the low electrical conductivity and lack of active sites for hydrogen evolution. Consequently, in this review, the engineering strategies for activating cobalt carbonate hydroxide towards enhanced alkaline water splitting are summarized, which mainly includes morphology/support engineering, elemental doping, heterostructure engineering. Moreover, reaction mechanisms and compared performances of the cobalt carbonate hydroxide-based nanomaterials for HER/OER are comprehensively reviewed. At last, comprehensive summaries and outlook in developing cobalt carbonate hydroxide as a superior electro-catalyst are also discussed. We believe that this review will be helpful for scientists to develop promising electrocatalyst for water splitting. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, a bifunctional electrocatalyst FeCo/1:2/PNSC is developed by embedding FeCo nanoclusters into porous N,S-doped carbon foams (PNSC). The results show that the highly-dispersed FeCo nanoclusters provided more active sits for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The modulated electronic structure of heterojunction is found to accelerate the ORR/OER kinetic behaviors. The optimal FeCo/1:2/PNSC sample exhibits the excellent bifunctional oxygen catalytic activities with the half-wave potential of 0.86 V for ORR and the overpotential of 298 mV for OER at 20 mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte.

However, the practical application of sulfide is restricted by their low conductivity and rapid decline in activity derived from large volume fluctuation during electrocatalysis process. More importantly, the determination of exact active site of sulfide is complicated due to the inevitable electrochemical reconstruction. Herein, ZnS nanoparticles with Zn defect are anchored onto the surface of NiCo2S4 nanosheet to construct NiCo2S4/ZnS hybrids, which exhibit outstanding oxygen evolution performance with an ultralow overpotential of 140 mV. The anchoring of defective ZnS nanoparticles inhibit the volume expansion of NiCo2S4 nanosheet during the cycling process. Density-functional theory reveals that the build-in interfacial potential and Zn defect can facilitate the thermodynamic formation of *O to *OOH, thus improve their intrinsic activity.									55	1	0	0	2	0	55			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000674858200001	34153176

First, the combustion characteristics of torrefied corn stalk under different heating rates were measured by a thermogravimetric analyzer. Then, the combustion experiments of torrefied corn stalk at different temperatures were carried out in a tubular furnace. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of functional groups in torrefied corn stalk and char samples were performed by ATR-FTIR technology. The results show that the ignition temperature of torrefied corn stalk varied between 251 and 296 degrees C, and the burn-out temperature did not exceed 520 degrees C. In the low-temperature reaction stage, the aliphatic groups decomposed, and oxygen was absorbed by the char active sites to form an unstable C-O complex. The C-O complex further reacted to release CO and CO2. In the high-temperature stage, the aromatic groups were oxidized to form phenolic hydroxyl groups. After 450 degrees C, the dehydrogenation and condensation reactions of the char reduced the C-O content again.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0961-9534	1873-2909		WOS:000789628900006

Here, porous microrod arrays constructed by carbon-confined NiCo@NiCoO2 core@shell nanoparticles (NiCo@NiCoO2/C PMRAs) are fabricated by the reductive carbonization of bimetallic (Ni, Co) metal-organic framework microrod arrays (denoted as NiCo-MOF MRAs) and subsequent controlled oxidative calcination. They successfully combine the desired merits including large specific surface areas, high conductivity, and multiple electrocatalytic active sites for OER. In addition, the oxygen vacancies in NiCo@NiCoO2/C PMRAs significantly improve the conductivity of NiCoO2 and accelerate the kinetics of OER. The above advantages obviously enhance the electrocatalytic performance of NiCo@NiCoO2/C PMRAs. The experimental results demonstrate that the NiCo@NiCoO2/C PMRAs as electrocatalysts exhibit high catalytic activity, low overpotential, and high stability for OER in alkaline media. The strategy reported will open up a new route for the fabrication of porous bimetallic composite electrocatalysts derived from MOFs with controllable morphology for electrochemical energy conversion devices.									297	10	0	0	21	0	298			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000434032600037	29633428

The catalysts for oxygen evolution reactions (OER) are very important in this process. Herein, we have synthesized Co3V2O8 nanoparticles by a simple and cost-effective technique, which have low crystallinity and large specific surface area (122.8 m(2) g(-1)). Because of the low crystallinity, large specific surface area and suitable pore size, Co3V2O8 nanoparticles yielded an electrocatalytic OER current density of up to 429.7 mA cm(-2) at 2.05 V vs. RHE and low OER over potentials of 359 mV (at 10 mA cm(-2)) and 497 mV (at 100 mA cm(-2)). In addition, the OER stability of the Co3V2O8 catalyst was very excellent, and the current density at 2.05 V was reduced by just 7.3% after galvanostatic OER measurement at 10 mA cm(-2) for 3 h. This work demonstrates that binary metal oxides Co3V2O8 is a highly active and stable oxygen evolution electrocatalyst that can potentially replace expensive noble metal-based anode catalysts for electrochemical water splitting to generate hydrogen fuels.									144	8	0	0	8	0	146			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000344380000038

IrO2 nanoparticles (about 16-33 wt%) were successfully loaded on Nb0.05Ti0.95O2 powders as the electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic medium. The IrO2/Nb0.05Ti0.55O2 catalyst with the IrO2 loading of 26 wt% exhibits the best mass normalized cyclic voltammetry charge and mass normalized activity among all the IrO2/Nb0.05Ti0.53O2 catalysts because IrO2 nanoparticles were uniformly supported on the surface of Nb0.05Ti0.95O2 providing conductive channels to reduce the grain boundary resistance. Due to the anchoring effect of carrier on the catalyst, the stability of the supported IrO2 was significantly improved as compared to the unsupported one. The IrO2/Nb0.05Ti0.95O2 catalyst with 26 wt% IrO2 loading demonstrates the best effectiveness of the OER activity and cost. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Intriguingly, Na2Mn3O7 can access an oxygen-redox capacity with an abnormal small voltage hysteresis (~0.05 V), making it a rare model system to identify a reaction mechanism that suitable for engineering oxygen-redox cathodes with high energy efficiency. Herein, we firstly corroborate by operando electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) that the local electronic structure evolution of Na2Mn3O7 upon oxygen redox is highly reversible. By ex situ low-temperature EPR measurements, we also confirm that O-2 p localized holes (O-.) is the chemical state of oxidized oxygen species in Na2-xMn3O7, contributing to a highly reversible local structural evolution around Na nucleus. The stable electronic structure stimulated by the absence of in-plane Mn migration and the dispersive oxygen redox without O -O dimerization in Na2-xMn3O7, is thus firstly proposed as the origin of abnormal small voltage hysteresis. This study provides the rationale for achieving nonhysteretic behavior in the large family of oxygen-redox cathodes.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2405-8297			WOS:000797801000002

The ideal NPM electrocatalysts usually feature (1) highly active intrinsic sites; (2) high-density and uniform active sites to reduce the energy barrier of the reaction and increase the surface electron-mass transfer rate, thus improving the activity, turnover efficiency, and selectivity of the catalyst. Molecular engineering strategy is an effective approach to realize the bottom-up construction of high-performance NPM electrocatalysts with well-defined active sites. In this review, the recent progress about utilizing molecules including small molecules, metal-organic frameworks (MOF), covalent organic frameworks (COF), biomolecules, and polyoxometalate (POM) as precursors to build NPM electrocatalysts (M-NC single-atom catalysts, NPM-based materials, and metal-free carbon-based materials) with high-loading-density and well-defined active sites for electrochemical energy conversion are summarized. Finally, the prospects and challenges for the future development of high-performance and industrially applicable electrocatalysts are proposed.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000711035400001

The morphology, crystal structure, microstructure, and composition of as-fabricated Co@ Co9S8 electrodes were examined by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and their electrochemical properties were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronopotentiometry (CP), chronoamperometry (CA), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). When used to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution, the Co@Co9S8 electrode with an optimal Co9S8 loading exhibits outstanding catalytic activity, requiring a low overpotential of 350 mV to deliver an anodic current density of 10 mAcm(-2) and showing fast kinetics for OER with a small Tafel slope (55 mVdec(-1)) and charge-transfer resistance (0.44 Omega cm(-2)), which outperforms many sulfide-based OER catalysts and some state-of-the-art noble metal catalysts recently reported in the literature.

It is a major challenge to design an efficient, robust and inexpensive electrocatalyst to achieve preferable catalytic performance. Herein, a novel three-dimensional (3D) electrocatalyst was prepared by decorating nanostructured biological material-derived carbon nanofibers with in situ generated cobalt-based nanospheres (denoted as CNF@Co) through a facile approach. The interconnected porous 3D networks of the resulting CNF@Co catalyst provide abundant channels and interfaces, which remarkably favor both mass transfer and oxygen evolution. The as-prepared CNF@Co shows excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen evolution reactions with an onset potential of about 0.445 V vs. Ag/AgCl. It only needs a low overpotential of 314 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) in 1.0 M KOH. Furthermore, the CNF@Co catalyst exhibits excellent stability towards water oxidation, even outperforming commercial IrO2 and RuO2 catalysts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

As the activity and stability of NCs are highly dependent on their structure and the elemental distribution, it is of great importance to understand the formation mechanism of octahedral NCs and to rationally synthesize shape-controlled alloy catalysts with optimized ORR activity and stability. However, the factors controlling the structural and compositional evolution during the synthesis have not been well understood yet. Here, we systematically investigated the structure and composition evolution pathways of Pt-Ni octahedra synthesized with the assistance of W(CO)(6) and revealed a unique core-shell structure, consisting of a Pt core and a Pt-Ni alloy shell. Below 140 degrees C, sphere-like pure Pt NCs with the diameter of 3-4 nm first nucleated, followed by the isotropic growth of Pt-Ni alloy on the seeds at temperatures between 170 and 230 degrees C forming Pt@Pt-Ni core-shell octahedra with {111} facets. Owing to its unique structure, the Pt@Pt-Ni octahedra show an unparalleled stability during potential cycling, that is, no activity drop after 10 000 cycles between 0.6 and 1.0 V. This work proposes the Pt@Pt-Ni octahedra as a high profile electrocatalyst for ORR and reveals the structural and composition evolution pathways of Pt-based bimetallic NCs.									45	2	0	0	2	0	45			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000403631600088	28493711

Among the many obstacles facing PEC water splitting, a critical challenge is the lack of efficient photoanodes for the water oxidation reaction. Here, we report an n-n(+) type-II homojunction of Zn:BiVO4/Mo:BiVO4, which improves the bulk transport and surface charge transfer processes of the well-studied BiVO4 photoanode. In this homojunction, the Zn and Mo dopants move the BiVO4 valence band maximum and conduction band minimum, respectively, closer to the Fermi level, establishing an n-n(+) type-II homojunction. The staggered band alignment between Zn:BiVO4 and Mo:BiVO4 facilitates electron-hole separation between the two layers. The Mo dopant increases the donor concentration, leading to higher electrical conductivity. The Zn dopant increases the number of oxygen chemisorption sites, improving the interfacial charge transfer process. With additional deposition of the oxygen evolution electrocatalyst Ni:FeOOH, the homojunction achieves charge transport and transfer efficiencies of 65% and 89%, respectively. The final Ni:FeOOH/Zn:BiVO4/Mo:BiVO4 photoanode achieves a photocurrent density of 2.7 mA cm(-2) and a faradaic efficiency for oxygen evolution of approximate to 92% at 1.23 V vs. RHE in the electrolyte of potassium buffer solution (pH approximate to 7).									49	4	0	0	1	0	49			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000465152700032

Unique properties of activation under light irradiation, tunable band gap energies with extraordinary photostability craft perovskite titanates as an efficient semiconductor photocatalyst for photocatalytic performance. Herein, highly active and stable perovskite titanates such as PbTiO3, CoTiO3 and BaTiO3 were synthesized through a simple low cost citric gel method. The as-synthesized phototocatalysts were well characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Ultra violet Spectroscopy and Photoluminescence techniques. The results revealed that CoTiO3 exhibited an excellent photocatalytic performance towards oxygen evolution and multiple reproducible characteristic features under visible light illumination. The highest oxygen evolution yield was up to 98.12 mu mol/h. The high photocatalytic activity toward O-2 evolution is due to minimal recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers in the material, as elucidated from photoluminescence spectroscopy analysis. Overall, the present work may provide a new reference for the fabrication of various high-quality perovskite titanates, promoting their potential for different photocatalytic applications.

Here, {112} high-index facet exposed porous Co3O4 nano sheets with oxygen vacancies on the surface have been successfully synthesized via a simple hydrothermal method followed by NaBH4 reduction. As compared with the pristine and other faceted porous Co3O4 nanosheets (e.g., {110} and {111}), the as-prepared {112} faceted porous nanosheets exhibit a much lower overpotential of 318 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Importantly, these nanosheets also give excellent electrochemical stability, displaying an insignificant change in the required overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) even after a 14 h long-term test. All these superior OER activity and stability could be attributed to their unique hierarchical structures assembled by ultrathin porous nanosheets, {112} high-index exposed facets with higher ratio of Co2+/Co3+ and oxygen vacancies on the surface, which can substantially enhance the charge transfer rate and increase the number of active sites. All these findings not only demonstrate the potency of our Co3O4 nanosheets for efficient water oxidation but also provide further insights into developing cost-effective and high-performance catalysts for electrochemical applications.									130	5	0	0	3	0	132			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000426618000033	29406690

The anode is interposed between two cobalt(II,III) oxide-carbon nanofilm (CNF)/titanium cathodes by a fixed gap. The water is purified with a total dissolved solid (TDS) removing adsorbent and a chemical oxygen demand (COD) removing adsorbent, where water in a fluid form is chosen from tap water, fresh water, online-generated purified water and steam. Oxygen is generated from electrolyzed water on the anode through an oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electric power is generated by reducing oxygen on the cathode through an oxygen reductive reaction (ORR) using low direct current power. The electric power generated from the cathode is drawn and stored by at least one super capacitor. USE - Generation of electric power for all water fuel cell (AWFC) and alkali fuel cell. Uses include but are not limited to hospital, factory, electric vehicle, electric bus, research submarines, military affairs, home and community. ADVANTAGE - The method scales up AWFC at an affordable price to generate high currents and high voltages. The COD removal requires low power consumption. The removal of microorganisms and decomposition of insecticide are achieved without generating hydrogen at an appropriate stage with an appropriate quantity of ozone and hydrogen peroxide. The poorly soluble contaminants in water can be quantified by high concentrations of TDS and COD. The CNFs grown directly on stainless steel plates along with gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) can be used to produce high voltage super capacitor modules that store electricity generated by the ORR and discharge it at high power.

We used overdoping strategy to prepare two-phase oxide electrocatalyst SrCo0.9Fe0.05Mo0.35Ox (SCFM0.35) containing double perovskite and Co3O4 with excellent OER electrocatalytic activity and stability in alkaline solution. It required an overpotential of 361.7 mV to reach a 10 mA cm(-2) current density and its performance only degrades by 3.48% after 1000 CV cycles accelerated stability tests, whose electrochemical performance is superior to that of single-phase double perovskites and undoped perovskites. SrCo0.9Fe0.1O3 (SCF) ordinary perovskite is doped with slightly molybdenum (Mo), and then the ordinary perovskite turns into double perovskite because of the polyvalence characteristics of Mo. When Mo is overdoped, Co3O4 phase was precipitated while Mo entered perovskite phase. This process causes lattice distortion and makes the surface electronic structure benign changes. Furthermore, the microscopic morphology of the material surface and the valence state of cobalt element are changed, thereby improving the microenvironment of the electrochemical process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000782517300001	35344261

Pb-based alloys are used in EW because they are cheap, conductive, and relatively stable at high potentials and low pH. In this study, polarization behavior and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on a Pb-Ag alloy were examined as a function of H2SO4, Mn2+, Cl-, Zn2+ concentrations and solution temperature. The slope of the oxygen evolution region and the OER potential were determined using potentiodynamic experiments. Corrosion products were studied using potentiostatic experiments along with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD). The relationship between surface morphology of the electrode and operating potential was studied. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical Society.

J	Liu, Qian; Lin, Baiquan; Zhou, Yan; Zheng, Yuannan								The evolution law of functional groups during the heating of coal in oxygen and oxygen-free atmospheres								GREENHOUSE GASES-SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				11	2			266	276		10.1002/ghg.2047		JAN 2021		APR 2021	2021	There is a change in both the quantity and type of functional groups due to the fact that they become oxidized and pyrolyzed during the spontaneous coal combustion process. In order to study the oxidation and pyrolysis mechanisms that are at play during the evolution of these functional groups, in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was employed to test the real-time evolution of these functional groups in both air and argon atmospheres. The differences found between functional groups when under an oxygen oxygen-free environment were analyzed. The results show that when the temperature exceeds 200 degrees C, the changes in functional groups steadily increase and that regardless of whether the atmosphere is made up of argon or air, the oxygen-containing functional groups change significantly. In this situation, -OH, -CH3, and -CH2- are important reactants in the whole heating process; -COOH and -C=O are reactants during the low temperature oxidation stage, but when reaching the high temperature stage, they become the products; C-O-C and C=C is a stable reaction product. During the coal spontaneous combustion process, oxidation and pyrolysis work as two coupling reactions: The heat released by the oxidation reaction pyrolyzes the macromolecular structure and coal-oxygen complexes, while a large number of active groups are produced during pyrolysis, which then provides the reactants for the oxidation reaction. These results reveal the changes that functional groups go through during the process of oxidation and pyrolysis, and provide a theoretical basis for the development of efficient fire-fighting materials.

Herein, a series of Ni@Ru core-shell nanoparticles on flower-like carbon nanosheets (denoted as Ni@Ru/CNS-x, where x is the initial Ru mass loading percentage, and x = 5%, 10%, 15%) were fabricated through a facile wet chemical strategy by employing a metal-organic framework (MOF) as a sacrificial precursor. The Ni@Ru/CNS-x series was investigated to catalyze hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in all-pH-value solutions, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and water electrolysis in alkaline media. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed the Ni@Ru/CNS-x presented a three-dimensional (3D) flower-like structure composed of nanosheets with a thickness of approximately 30 nm. The resultant catalysts exhibited excellent HER, OER and OWS performance in 1.0 M KOH. Ni@Ru/CNS-10% displayed the most outstanding electrocatalytic properties, evidenced by a low overpotential of 20.1 mV and 356 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH, and outperformed stability than Pt/C and RuO2 for HER and OER, respectively. Moreover, it exhibited a potential of 1.612 V @10 mA cm(-2) in the practical OWS test, superior to both Pt/C and RuO(2)( )catalysts. The strategy can be extended for rational design and preparation of low cost, highly active and durable electrocatalyst with bifunctionalities for OWS and other renewable energy devices.

The topmost surface is subject to a continuous flux of CO molecules and the oxidation reaction occurs through the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. The reactions only occur when a CO molecule finds an active surface O atom. The subsurface monolayers act as a reservoir of oxygen atoms, which guarantees the continuous evolution of the surface reactions. We have employed Monte Carlo simulations to monitor the CO2 yielding as a function of time. The transient profile of CO2 yielding depends on temperature, as well as on the initial distribution of O atoms on the subsurface planes. When the CO2 yielding attains a stationary state, an almost free oxygen region appears between the topmost layer and the bulk, whatever the initial distribution of oxygens we have considered. Our results are compared with some experimental observations at the oxygen-rich Ruthenium surface. (C) 2003 American Institute of Physics.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0021-9606			WOS:000181667900034

However, the strong bonding between the Ru sites and oxygen intermediates leads to high overpotential to trigger the OER process. Hence, pyrochlore rare-earth ruthenate (RE2-Ru2O7) structures with a series of rare-earth elements (Nd, Sm, Gd, Er, and Yb) were constructed to tune the electronic structure of the Ru sites. Surface structure analysis indicated that the increase of the radius of the rare-earth cations resulted in higher content of defective oxygen (the percentage of the defective oxygen increased from 29.5% to 49.7%) in the RE2Ru2O7 structure due to the weakened hybridization of the Ru-O bond. This reduced the valence states of the Ru sites and enlarged the gap between the 4d band center and the Fermi level (E-F) of Ru, resulting in the weakened adsorption of oxygen intermediates and the improved OER performance in acid media. Among the as-prepared ruthenium pyrochlores, Nd2Ru2O7 displayed the lowest OER onset overpotential (210 mV) and Tafel slope (58.48 mV dec(-1)), as well as 30 times higher intrinsic activity and much higher durability than the state-of-art RuO2 catalyst.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000616491800001

With the increase of reaction time before the formation of Co(OH)(2), the oxygen vacancies and conductivity of Co3O4 nanoplates continued to increase resulting in dramatically enhanced OER performances(.) An ultralow overpotential of 354 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope as low as 63.24 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution were obtained, superior to those of most reported oxides and RuO2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1466-8033		WOS:000651851200001

However, the redox reaction is heavily influenced by gas diffusion, making it very difficult to derive convincing intrinsic kinetic data. This work aims to establish a methodology to evaluate the intrinsic kinetics of oxygen carriers for chemical looping combustion by using an ultra-thin oxygen conducting membrane to exclude the influence of gas diffusion. From mass balance and Fick's second law, a mathematical kinetics model describing the intrinsic oxygen conduction performance was established. The intrinsic activation energy took value of 77.84 kJ/mol for pure Fe2O3. The kinetics parameters can be used for the high throughput design and screening of oxygen carriers.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-3820	1873-7188		WOS:000863994700002

Here, we report controlled structural transitions of metal-organic frameworks through a weak-strong competitive coordination strategy for high-performance electrocatalysts. Upon the introduction of potassium ferricyanide (PF) and/or phosphomolybdic acid (POM), cubic zeolitic-imidazole framework-67 (Cube-67) undergoes both chemical and macroscopic morphology changes, i.e., from nanocubes to hollow nanopompoms, where PF and POM act as the weak chelator (i.e., for finer structures) and the strong chelator (i.e., shape-directing agent), respectively. After calcination, the hierarchically structured nanopompoms display tunable and high-performance OER and ORR catalytic activities suitable for Zn-air batteries that display a long-term charge-discharge cycling stability. This work not only holds promise for clean-energy applications but provides a design principle for engineering advanced electrocatalysts by effectively tuning their structural and chemical properties.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000830796800001

Here we show electrochemical redox behaviors of perovskite-type SrCoOx (2.5 <= x <= 2.92) in aprotic Li+ electrolyte solutions by measurements of open circuit potentials (OCPs) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. Changes in OCPs and XRD patterns suggest that SrCoO2.92 is electrochemically reduced to SrCoO2.5 as follows: First, oxygen atoms are extracted from SrCoO2.92 to form Li2O2 by reacting with Li+. Then both the reduction of the Li2O2 and the further extraction of oxygen atoms from SrCoOx proceed to form Li2O and SrCoO2.5. In the subsequent re-oxidation, oxygen atoms of Li2O are re-inserted into SrCoO2 5 and the oxygen composition reach SrCoO2.67, followed by evolution of gaseous molecular oxygen and carbon dioxide by decomposition of the Li2O and side reactions of the electrolyte, respectively. The cycling test shows the 1st discharge capacity is 75 mAh g(-1) and the 10th one is still 41 mAh g(-1). These results indicate the viability of a rechargeable battery utilizing the topotactic oxygen extraction/insertion of cathode materials such as SrCoOx in aprotic Li+ electrolyte solutions.

In the context of oxygen electrocatalysis as applied to fuel cells and water splitting the involved O-2 is typically considered to be exclusively in its triplet ground state. However, applying spin-conservation rules for the transformation between triplet O-2 and singlet OH-/H2O reaction intermediates predicts an additional free energy barrier associated with the required spin flip. As a result, for conditions under which both can form, the formation of triplet dioxygen from the singlet OH-/H2O might be slower than the formation of singlet O-2. Correspondingly, singlet O-2 might be more active than triplet O-2 in the oxygen reduction reaction. Here, we discuss the possible existence and influence of singlet oxygen in oxygen electrocatalysis. Some perspectives for studying singlet oxygen in oxygen electrocatalysis are also provided.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			2515-7655			WOS:000649092200001

In this work, the introduction of exogenous modifier Ni-MOF improved the reaction kinetics and morphology of the NiCo2O4@Ni-MOF/NF catalyst. Asobtained NiCo2O4@Ni-MOF/NF has excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) performance. The catalyst need overpotential of 340 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm-2 for OER and a potential of 1.31 V at the same current density for UOR. The Tafel slopes of NiCo2O4@Ni-MOF/NF is 38.34 and 15.33 mV dec-1 for OER and UOR respectively, which is more superior than 78.58 and 66.73 mV dec-1 of NiCo2O4/NF. The nanosheets microstructure is beneficial to the adsorption and transport of electrolyte and the presence of a large number of mesoporous channels can also accelerate gas release, and then improves activity of the catalyst. Density functional theory calculation demonstrate that NiCo2O4 plays a role in absorbing water, while the existence of in situ generated NiOOH can promote the electron transfer efficiency. It is synergies of NiCo2O4 and in situ generated NiOOH that enhance the decomposition of water on the surface of the NiCo2O4@Ni-MOF/NF. This investigation provides a new strategy for the application of spinel oxide and MOF materials. (c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this work we report the electrocatalytic ability hybrid of Molybdenum Carbide (Mo2C) and ZIF-67 hybrid heterostructures fabricated by annealing at high temperatures. This bifunctional electrocatalyst have shown an outstanding performance for water splitting with high activity both for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes. The hybrid (MCZ-2) with ratio of 1:2 have shown superior catalytic activity with a low overpotential of 169 mV and 208 mV at the current density of 10 mA/cm2 and 20 mA/cm2 respectively for HER. Similarly, for OER, it shows overpotential of 340 mV and 370 mV at the current density of 20 mA/cm2 and 50 mA/cm2. Besides, the MCZ-2 have shown a long-term stability 24 h at the current density of 100 mu A/cm2. The boosted HER and OER activity of the hybrid is attributed to synergetic effect between ZIF-67 and Mo2C and modulation of active sites due to the presence of N and Co in the hybrid.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000677909200002

Here, by performing first-principles calculations, we report the atomic-level electrocatalytic activity mechanism of 3d, 4d, and 5d monoatomic transition metals (TM) bound to the 1T-MoS2 monolayer for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Their structural stabilities are evaluated via the formation energy, elastic constant, and molecular dynamics simulations. Compared with the Co-N-4-C single atom catalyst (SAC), the resulting Pd@1T-MoS2 SAC exhibits better bifunctional catalytic activity, with OER overpotential as low as 0.43 V and an ORR overpotential of 0.40 V. The dual volcano plot demonstrates that the bifunctional OER and ORR activities of Pd@1T-MoS2 originate from the neither strong nor weak OH* adsorption and the suitable d-band center (-1.83 eV) of the Pd active center. In conjunction with the intrinsic activity of the 1T-MoS2 monolayer for hydrogen evolution reaction, the Pd@1T-MoS2 SAC is a competitive and promising trifunctional electrocatalyst for sustainable energy conversion and storage systems.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			2470-1343			WOS:000703535900043	34604655

However, their applications have been limited by a narrow potential window (similar to 1.23 V), beyond which the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions occur. Here we report the formation of layered Mn5O8 pseudocapacitor electrode material with a well-ordered hydroxylated interphase. A symmetric full cell using such electrodes demonstrates a stable potential window of 3.0V in an aqueous electrolyte, as well as high energy and power performance, nearly 100% coulombic efficiency and 85% energy efficiency after 25,000 charge-discharge cycles. The interplay between hydroxylated interphase on the surface and the unique bivalence structure of Mn5O8 suppresses the gas evolution reactions, offers a two-electron charge transfer via Mn2+/Mn4+ redox couple, and provides facile pathway for Na-ion transport via intra-/inter-layer defects of Mn5O8.									90	3	0	0	6	0	90			2041-1723			WOS:000387971900001	27845345

Here, we report one single atom W6+ doped Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet sample (w-Ni(OH)(2)) with an outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance that is, in a 1 M KOH medium, an overpotential of 237 mV is obtained reaching a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). Moreover, at high current density of 80 mA/cm(2), the overpotential value is 267 mV. The corresponding Tafel slope is measured to be 33 mV/dec. The d(0) W6+ atom with a low spin-state has more outermost vacant orbitals, resulting in more water and OH- groups being adsorbed on the exposed W sites of the Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the O radical and O-O coupling are both generated at the same site of W6+. This work demonstrates that W6+ doping can promote the electrocatalytic water oxidation activity of Ni(OH)(2) with the highest performance.									237	14	0	0	19	0	240			2041-1723			WOS:000467836900003	31089139

Therefore, the fabrication of a bifunctional electrocatalyst is an emerging focus for the promotion and dissemination of energy storage/conversion devices. Spinel and perovskite transition metal oxides have been widely explored as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts to replace the noble metals in fuel cell and metal-air batteries. In this work, we developed a bifunctional catalyst for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) study using the mechanochemical route coupling of cobalt oxide nano/microspheres and carbon black particles incorporated lanthanum manganite perovskite (LaMnO3@C-Co3O4) composite. It was synthesized through a simple and less-time consuming solid-state ball-milling method. The synthesized LaMnO3@C-Co3O4 composite was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, and micro-Raman spectroscopy techniques. The electrocatalysis results showed excellent electrochemical activity towards ORR/OER kinetics using LaMnO3@C-Co3O4 catalyst, as compared with Pt/C, bare LaMnO3@C, and LaMnO3@C-RuO2 catalysts. The observed results suggested that the newly developed LaMnO3@C-Co3O4 electrocatalyst can be used as a potential candidate for air-cathodes in fuel cell and metal-air batteries.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8				2073-4344		WOS:000610003500001

Here we show that an efficient oxygen electrode can be developed by electrodepositing amorphous mesoporous nickel-iron composite nanosheets directly onto macroporous nickel foam substrates. The as-prepared oxygen electrode exhibits high catalytic activity towards water oxidation in alkaline solutions, which only requires an overpotential of 200 mV to initiate the reaction, and is capable of delivering current densities of 500 and 1,000 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 240 and 270 mV, respectively. The electrode also shows prolonged stability against bulk water electrolysis at large current. Collectively, the as-prepared three-dimensional structured electrode is the most efficient oxygen evolution electrode in alkaline electrolytes reported to the best of our knowledge, and can potentially be applied for industrial scale water electrolysis.									1431	59	0	0	67	0	1447			2041-1723			WOS:000353041100003	25776015

First-series Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) oxides (A(2)BO(4)) have emerged as promising electrocatalysts for these reactions due to their suitable mixed ionic and electronic conductivities. However, a detailed understanding of the factors that govern their performance is still elusive, making their optimization challenging. In the present work, a systematic theoretical study is used to investigate the underlying factors that control the process of surface oxygen exchange, which governs oxygen reduction and evolution on these oxides. The effects of A- and B-site composition and surface termination of these oxides on their activities are elucidated. Among the different compositions, Co-based, B-site-terminated R-P oxides are predicted to exhibit the highest activity due to providing the best compromise between the energetics associated with oxygen dissociation and surface oxygen vacancy formation. A "volcano"-type relation between the calculated rates for surface oxygen exchange and O-2 binding energy on a surface oxygen vacancy is found, suggesting the O-2 binding energy might be used as an activity descriptor to identify R-P oxides with optimized performance. These findings shed light on the factors that govern the reported experimental behaviors of these oxides and lay the groundwork for the development of predictive models to design optimal mixed ionic and electronic conducting oxides for high-temperature oxygen reduction and evolution.									27	1	0	0	3	0	27			2155-5435			WOS:000410005700039

This is a challenging target due to the large number of variables that determine the performance of a heterogeneous catalyst. The complexity of the problem has reduced considerably with the advent of single atom catalysts (SACs) and, in particular, of graphene-based SACs for electrocatalytic reactions such as the oxygen reduction (ORR), the oxygen evolution (OER), and the hydrogen evolution (HER) reactions. In this context we assist with a rapidly growing number of theoretical studies based on density functional theory (DFT) and with proposals of universal descriptors that should provide a guide to the experimentalist for the synthesis of efficient catalysts. In this Perspective we critically analyze some of the current problems connected with the prediction of the activity of SACs: accuracy of the calculations, neglect of important contributions in the models used, physical meaning of the proposed descriptors, not to mention some problems of reproducibility. It follows that the "rational design" of a catalyst based on some of the proposed universal descriptors should be considered with caution.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000821348900001

The effects of processing parameters on the film proper-ties, such as overpotential, composition, surface morphology and preferred orientation, were investigated. The electrochemical experiment, structural and compositional measurements indicate that the relative lower substrate temperature, higher RF power, higher working pressure and oxygen content are necessary to gain lower overpotential. The lowest overpotential of 251 mV is obtained at a current density of 80 mA/cm(2). The existence of iron, which acts as activity site, and Ni3+ ion is responsible for lowering overpotential. By analyzing SEM and XRD data, it is also noticed that an improvement in crystallinity, appropriate grain size and less crystalline phase contribute to an increased electrocatalytic activity in oxygen evolution reaction. These results mentioned above indicate that iron-doped nickel oxide is promising as an oxygen catalyst.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1003-6326	2210-3384		WOS:000243345900010

Understanding and further controlling the surface evolution under catalytic conditions is of significant importance to develop highly efficient OER catalysts. Here, we present a versatile P-modulation strategy to precisely engineer the reconstruction of active layers of Co(SeP)(2) nanobelts under catalytic conditions for efficient OER. Notably, the modulation of P was monitored to facilitate the generation of high-valence oxidized Co sites, promote the formation of oxygen deficiencies, and increase the exposure of active sites in the reconstructed active layers under OER conditions. Accordingly, the P-modulated catalysts exhibited remarkable OER activity. This work provides a framework for understanding catalytic activity on reconstructed surface and enables an ingenious design of highly efficient electrocatalysts through precisely engineering the reconstructed active species under catalytic conditions.

However, the practical applications of these devices are limited as a result of the sluggish kinetics of OER and ORR as well as the high cost and instability of the state-of-the-art noble metal catalyst used in these systems. In this study, cation deficiency is introduced to the A-site of perovskite LaCoO3 synthesized via polymer-assisted approach to enhance the electrocatalytic activity of both OER and ORR, leading to the boosted bifunctionality of the resultant electrocatalysts, which might be attributed to oxygen vacancy introduction in perovskites. The bifunctionality of the A-site deficiency perovskite (Delta E=0.948 V) is comparable or even better than the pristine LaCoO3 (Delta E=1.063 V) as well as the reported state-of-the-art electrocatalysts, including both perovskites and noble metal electrocatalysts. The stability test also indicates their good stability under alkaline solutions, suggesting that the as-prepared materials can be good candidates as bifunctional electrocatalysts in oxygen-based electrochemical devices, such as fuel cells and metal-air batteries. This work introduces the A-site cation deficiency strategy to improve the bifunctional electrocatalytic performance of perovskites, and highlights the facile polymer-assisted approach for perovskites synthesis.									29	2	0	0	2	1	29			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000523236400001

Bifunctional catalysts can significantly simplify the electrolysis system and enhance the overall electrochemical efficiency. Herein, three-dimensional nanostructured Ni and MoN compounds (Ni-Mo-N) with Schottky heterojunctions on the surface are developed as bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It is found that the solvents and pyrolysis temperature play a very important role in the formation of Ni-Mo-N with Schottky heterojunctions. The optimized Ni-Mo-N can deliver an overpotential of 125 mV (@100 mA cm(-2) current density) in HER, which is approach to the Pt/C (20 wt%) (116 mV). Ni-Mo-N also exhibits high-performance in OER, comparable to RuO2. When Ni-Mo-N is assembled as cathode and anode for water electrolysis, at the cell voltage of 1.604 V the cell reaches the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with remarkable durability, making the Ni-Mo-N a promising bifunctional catalyst for water electrolysis.

The electrode surface of the magnetron sputtering Pt was uniform with particle size of 10 nm. The characteristic peaks of Ti were not found in the XPS spectrum, which showed that the Ti matrix was completely covered by Pt. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) results showed that the electrochemical area of the magnetron sputtering Pt was the smallest (1.08 cm(2)), which was close to the apparent surface area of the electrode. In addition, the electrical amperage ratio of the oxygen adsorption area to the hydrogen adsorption area was only 0.83 calculated from the CV diagram. So it can be predicted that the oxygen adsorption capacity on the magnetron sputtering Pt is very poor and not prone to the oxygen evolution reaction. When the electrode potential was 1.6 V, the chlorine evolution reaction current of the magnetron sputtering Pt was 0.085 A/cm(2) in the unit electrochemical area, which was 3.27 and 49.0 times that of the electro-deposition Pt and thermal decomposition Pt, respectively. It showed that the magnetron sputtering Pt had a high activity of chlorine evolution in the unite active site. It may be related to the special morphology of its surface (111) crystal surface. On the basis of the above, the Tafel slope of the magnetron sputtering Pt was 44.3 mV/dec. The mechanism of chlorine evolution reaction was in accordance with the mechanism of Volmer-Heyrovsky, and the rate controlling step was the electrochemical desorption step.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-324X			WOS:000376674600011		
J	Ejeta, Shibiru Yadeta; Imae, Toyoko								Cobalt Incorporated Graphitic Carbon Nitride as a Bifunctional Catalyst for Electrochemical Water-Splitting Reactions in Acidic Media								MOLECULES				27	19					6445	10.3390/molecules27196445				OCT 2022	2022	Non-noble metal-based bifunctional electrocatalysts may be a promising new resource for electrocatalytic water-splitting devices. In this work, transition metal (cobalt)-incorporated graphitic carbon nitride was synthesized and fabricated in electrodes for use as bifunctional catalysts. The optimum catalytic activity of this bifunctional material for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which benefitted at a cobalt content of 10.6 wt%, was promoted by the highest surface area and conductivity. The activity achieved a minimum overpotential of similar to 85 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and a Tafel slope of 44.2 mV/dec in an acidic electrolyte. These values of the HER were close to those of a benchmark catalyst (platinum on carbon paper electrode). Moreover, the kinetics evaluation at the optimum catalyst ensured the catalyst flows (Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism), indicating that the adsorption step is rate-determining for the HER. The activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) indicated an overpotential of similar to 530 mV at 10 mAcm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 193.3 mV/dec, which were slightly less or nearly the same as those of the benchmark catalyst. Stability tests using long-term potential cycles confirmed the high durability of the catalyst for both HER and OER. Moreover, the optimal bifunctional catalyst achieved a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.84 V, which was slightly less than that of the benchmark catalyst (1.98 V). Thus, this research reveals that the present bifunctional, non-noble metallic electrocatalyst is adequate for use as a water-splitting technology in acidic media.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1420-3049		WOS:000867045600001	36234984

The oxygen atoms form a bridged between MoSx and GO and play a crucial role in the fine dispersion of the MoSx particles, control of planar MoSx growth, and increase of exposed active sulfur sites. This bridging leads to highly efficient (-157 mV overpotential and 41 mV/decade Tafel slope) and stable (95% versus initial activity after 1000 cycles) electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution.									27	0	0	0	3	0	27			2045-2322			WOS:000392346600001	28106126

The Ni3Fe/N-C sheets show excellent catalytic activity, selectivity, and durability toward both the oxygen-reduction and oxygen-evolution reactions (ORR and OER). They are shown to provide a superior, low-cost cathode for a rechargeable Zn-air battery. At a discharge-charge current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the Ni3Fe/N-C sheets enable a Zn-air battery to cycle steadily up to 420 h with only a small increase in the round-trip overpotential, outperforming the more costly Pt/C + IrO2 mixture catalyst (160 h). With the simplicity and scalability of the synthetic approach and its remarkable bifunctional electrocatalytic performance, the Ni3Fe/N-C sheets offer a promising rechargeable air cathode operating at room temperature in an alkaline electrolyte.									312	16	0	0	6	0	312			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000393583600008

They are environmentally friendly, cheap and have abundant precursors, which have aroused widespread interest and exhibit excellent performance in the fields of electrocatalysis (e. g. for the hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions) and energy storage (i. e. as electrode materials for supercapacitors). Furthermore, metal species can be incorporated into the porous carbon matrix without destroying the original 3D structure whilst improving its conductivity and electrochemical performance. Above all, most biomass materials contain nitrogen functionalities, and can be doped in situ (self-doping) with heteroatoms, such as N, without any additives, thereby creating additional defects and active centers with augmented electron density and electron-contributing attributes. Herein, the electrochemical applications of biomass-derived carbon aerogels reported during the last decade, especially in the field of water electrolysis, metal-air batteries, fuel cells and supercapacitors, are summarized. Current research challenges and future directions are briefly highlighted.									26	1	0	0	3	0	26			2196-0216			WOS:000557557800001

The samples are characterized by XRD, SEM, BET. SEM and BET results show that MCO-700 has a porous structure and a high specific surface area of 11.1 m(2) g(-1). Catalytic activities of these oxides for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 0.1 M KOH solution have been studied by using a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique. RRDE results show that MCO-700 exhibits better catalytic activity for the ORR. The ORR mainly favors a direct four electron pathway, and a maximum cathodic current density of 6.69 mA cm(-2) at 2500 rpm has been obtained, which is close to that of commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst under the same testing conditions. Anodic linear scanning voltammograms results show that MCO-700 is more active for the OER. Although MCO-700 shows a stable catalytic activity for the ORR, a serious attenuation exists for the OER due to the oxidization of carbon under high potential. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical Society.

Rechargeable zinc/atmospheric oxygen batteries are particularly suitable for this application. Use of atmospheric oxygen as reactant requires a semi-open construction with stringent demands on the materials of the interface. The state of the art of variants of this battery type and the principal components (air-diffusion electrode, zinc electrode, electrolyte) are presented in detail and discussed in this review article.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0009-286X			WOS:A1996UR48600011

The photoanode, which is responsible for solar-driven oxygen evolution, has persistently limited technology advancement due to the lack of materials that exhibit both the requisite electronic properties and operational stability. Efforts to extend the lifetime of solar fuel devices increasingly focus on mitigating corrosion in the highly oxidizing oxygen evolution environment, motivating our development of a photoanode discovery pipeline that combines electronic structure calculations, Pourbaix stability screening, and high-throughput experiments. By applying the pipeline to ternary metal oxides containing manganese, we identify a promising class of corrosion-resistant materials and discover five oxygen evolution photoanodes, including the first demonstration of photoelectrocatalysis with Mn-based ternary oxides and the introduction of alkaline earth manganates as promising photoanodes for establishing a durable solar fuels technology.									29	1	0	0	1	0	29			2380-8195			WOS:000415914200015

Herein, 10 first-row transition-metal (TM, from Sc to Zn) single atoms anchored on a graphyne (GY) nanosheet (TM@GY ) as electrocatalysts for water splitting are explored through computational screening approach. It is found that the single atoms prefer to tightly bind at the acetylenic-ring center of GY. Meanwhile, these TM@GY catalysts show metallic properties or reduced band gap, favoring electron transfer during the electrochemical processes. Moreover, both Co@GY and Mn@GY catalysts present good catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with both the acetylenic C and TM atoms being highly active sites. However, only the Co@GY catalyst shows good oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with an overpotential of 0.55 V. Thus, Co@GY could serve as a potential bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting. Besides, the d-band center of TM atoms on TM@GY can be turned through controlling TM atoms with different d-electron number and be used to predict the OER performance. This work highlights that GY doped with single non-precious-metals can be considered for designing high-active and low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts for practical electrochemical reactions.									56	2	0	0	4	0	56			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000489699700002

The aim of this work is to investigate the electrocatalytic activity of bimetal phthalocyanine-modified nanocarbon catalysts, e. g., the effect of carbon supports on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), including the anion-exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) and rechargeable zinc-air battery (RZAB) configuration. The catalysts exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity as exemplified by their half-wave potential (E-1/2) for ORR and the potential at which the OER current density reaches 10 mA cm(-2) (E-j=10), but the best performing catalysts are FeNiN-MC (E-1/2=0.88 V, E-j=10=1.58 V) and FeNiN-MWCNT (E-1/2=0.87 V, E-j=10=1.59 V). In AEMFC analyses, FeNiN-MWCNT cathode provides peak power density (P-max) of 406 mW cm(-2), slightly higher than that of FeNiN-MC (P-max=386 mW cm(-2)). Both catalysts exhibit a good RZAB performance (P-max of 85 mW cm(-2) for FeNiN-MWCNT). The assembled RZABs run stably for 48 h without any significant loss of performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000863947000001

Herein, rich IrCu/Ir interfaces can be successfully built by epitaxial growth of abundant IrCu nanoislands on IrCu nanowires, which can display superior performance for overall water splitting in both basic and neutral conditions. In particular, it only requires 38 and 242 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm-2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium, respectively. Meanwhile, it can also exhibit much better intrinsic activity than that of Pt/C and IrO2 in neutral solution. Further mechanistic studies reveal that numerous IrCu/Ir interfaces account for the enhanced catalytic activity of water splitting because this unique heterostructures can largely improve the intrinsic activity of OER and HER by boosting the adsorption of intermediates and facilitating the dissociation of water molecules, respectively. In addition, the distinctive one dimensional structure could effectively prevent the aggregation of electrocatalysts and enhance electrons transfer during water splitting. This work paves an original interface-engineering approach to build highly efficient heterostructures for water splitting, which may be extended to the preparation of other metal catalysts.									25	0	0	0	1	0	25			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000646130600003

Herein, we fabricate efficient disorder-engineered CaTiO3 nanosheets photocatalysts and illustrate functions of surface and subsurface oxygen vacancies on photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Our experimental and theoretical results reveal that subsurface oxygen vacancies can change energy band structure of CaTiO3 to form band tail states, improving charge separation; and surface oxygen vacancies can act as active centers to facilitate H-2 formation. Both merits promote similar to 49 times of the hydrogen evolution rate than pristine CaTiO3. In addition, we discover that improving charge separation with subsurface oxygen vacancies is more important than promoting surface reactions with surface oxygen vacancies in defect-engineered photocatalysts. Our work provides new insights into the hydrogenated disordered surface layer, as well as the rational design of photocatalysts with defect-engineering strategies.									50	2	0	0	3	0	50			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000518865300056

This RuO2 material displays excellent catalysis towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in Li-O2 batteries, because of increased catalytic sites, improved Li+ ions and electrons transport, and existence of electrolyte-filled intersheet zones between RuO2 sheets that will supply electrolyte to compensate for the evaporation of electrolyte. Specifically, the cell with the mesoporous RuO2 as carbon-free catalyst can deliver about 1000 and 700 mA h g-1 for the first and 100th cycle, respectively. Also, the cell used the RuO2 material as catalyst shows good rate capability with a capacity of about 500 mA h g-1 even at the current density of 1000 mA g-1. The good electrochemical performance suggests that the unique hierarchical mesoporous RuO2 could be a promising catalyst for future application in Li-O2 batteries.

The results indicate that the cathodic process on Q235 carbon steel electrode in oxygen-saturated 0.02 M Ca(OH)(2) with different concentrations of chloride ions contain three reactions except hydrogen evolution: dissolved oxygen reduction, the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II), and then the reduction of Fe(II) to Fe. The peak potential of ORR shifts to the positive direction as the chloride ion concentration increases. The oxygen molecule adsorption can be inhibited by the chloride ion adsorption, and the rate of ORR decreases as the concentration of chloride ions increases. The mechanism of ORR is changed from 2e(-) and 4e(-) reactions, occurring simultaneously, to quietly 4e(-) reaction with the increasing chloride ion concentration.									12	5	0	0	0	0	17			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000278940000016

We achieve chemical synthesis of similar to 5 unit cell thick double perovskite oxide nanosheets (NSs) and demonstrate their precise structural reversibility while catalyzing the successive oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER/ORR). 4.1 nm thick A-site ordered BaPrMn1.75Co0.25O5+delta(delta= 0.06-0.17) NSs with oxygen deficient PrO(x)terminated layers have flexible oxygen coordination of Pr(3+)ions, which promotes the redox processes. When subjected to systematic oxidation and reduction cycles by cyclic voltammetry under small electrochemical bias, the PrO(1.8)phase appears and disappears alternately at the NS surface, due to the intake and release of oxygen, respectively. The structural reversibility is attributed to the two-dimensional morphology and the A-site terminated surface with flexible anion stoichiometry. Although the underlying B-site cations are well-known active sites, this is the first demonstration of A(Pr3+)-site cations influencing the activity by reversibly altering their oxygen coordination. Higher Co-doping thwarts the NS formation, affecting the catalytic performance. The facile OER/ORR activity of the thickness-tunable NSs has larger implications as a bifunctional air-electrode material for metal-air batteries and fuel cells.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000573713500015	34094282

To enhance reaction rates, catalysts are required to minimize overpotential. Alternatives to noble metal electrocatalysts are essential to address these needs on a large scale. In this context, transition metal nitride (TMN) nanoparticles have attracted much attention owing to their high catalytic activity, distinctive electronic structures, and enhanced surface morphologies. Nickel-based materials are an ideal choice for electrocatalysts given nickel's abundance and low cost in comparison to noble metals. In this Minireview, advancements made specifically in Ni-based binary and ternary TMNs as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are critically evaluated. When used as OER electrocatalysts, Ni-based nanomaterials with 3 D architectures on a suitable support (e.g., a foam support) speed up electron transfer as a result of well-oriented crystal structures and also assist intermediate diffusion, during reaction, of evolved gases. 2 D Ni-based nitride sheet materials synthesized without supports usually perform better than 3 D supported electrocatalysts. The focus of this Minireview is a systematic description of OER activity for state-of-the-art Ni-based nitrides as nanostructured electrocatalysts.									88	5	0	0	6	0	88			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000480726300001	31197961

We have surveyed a series of heterobivalent scaffolds to identify an iron/benzimidazole-based metal-organic framework as a uniform starting material. By merging the catechol and imidazole units together, we get a direct entry into a highly efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst, which alleviates the need for dopants and modifying conditions. We demonstrate that by fine-tuning the chemical nature of an organic linker, one is able to modulate the electrochemical properties of a single precursor-derived electrocatalyst material.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2574-0962			WOS:000510104700019

In particular, the coupling of plasmonic functionality with the metal-based core-shell architectures in plasmon-enhanced electrocatalysis provides a sustainable route to improve the catalytic performances of the catalysts. Herein, the rationally designed AuNPs wrapped with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) spacer along with PdNPs (AuNP@rGO@Pd) as the final composite are reported. The rGO is proposed to promote the reduction of PdO, greatly enhance the conductivity, and catalytic activity of these nanohybrid structures. The plasmon-enhanced electrocatalytic performance of optimized AuNP@rGO(1)@Pd exhibits an approximate to 1.9- and 1.1-fold enhanced activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. The final composite also exhibits a superior stability up to 10000 s compared with the commercial Pd/C. The mechanism of the enhanced catalytic performance is monitored through in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy by observing the generated electron density under light irradiation. The results demonstrate that the energetic charge carriers are concentrated in the incorporated PdNPs, allowing higher catalytic performances for the overall water-splitting reaction. The conclusions herein drawn are expected to shed light on upcoming plasmon-induced electrocatalytic studies with analogous hybrid nanoarchitectures.									19	1	0	0	1	0	18			2196-7350			WOS:000456673900010

Herein a facile route is devised to synthesize S, N codoped carbon cubes embedding Co-Fe carbides by pyrolyzing the Co-Fe Prussian blue analogues (PBA) coated with methionine. Via the strong metal-sulfur interaction, the methionine coating provides a robust sheath to restrain the cubic morphology of PBA upon pyrolysis, which is proved highly beneficial for promoting the specific surface area and active sites exposure, leading to remarkable bifunctionality of ORR and OER comparable to the benchmarks of Pt/C and RuO2. Further elaborative investigations on the activity origin and postelectrolytic composition unravel that for ORR the high activity is mainly contributed by the S, N codoped carbon shell with the inactive carbide phase converting into carbonate hydroxides. For OER, the embedded Co-Fe carbides transform in situ into layered (hydr)oxides, serving as the actual active sites for promoting water oxidation. Zn-air batteries employing the developed hollow structure as the air cathode catalyst demonstrate superb rechargeability, energy efficiency, as well as portability.									40	2	0	0	4	0	40			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000530387500001	32372461

Suitable morphologies can effectively improve the surface area and performance of the materials. Herein, we reported a simple and controlled strategy to fabricate the CoSe2 with various shapes and applied these in water splitting. We successfully synthesized the spheres, wires and rods of CoSe2 via facile hydrothermal process through regulating the addition of NH4F to alter the morphologies of samples. Among these samples, the as-prepared CoSe2 spheres have urchin-like morphology with highly hollow structure, leading to large specific surface area and a great number of channels for promoting mass transfer efficiency. Therefore, the CoSe2 spheres as electrocatalyst exhibits excellent oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction performance in alkaline and acidic conditions, respectively. Electrochemical measurement illustrated that the CoSe2 spheres as electrocatalyst shown small overpotential and superior stability, which could be a promising candidate of effective electrocatalyst.

The results of density functional theory show that the interface region of CoP3/Ni2P heterostructures can significantly boost all of the catalytic performances. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to confirm the abundant structural defects and the corresponding adjustment of the electronic state, thus ameliorating the activation energy, conductivity, and active area of the catalyst. Benefiting from these, CoP3/Ni2P heterostructures exhibit superior performance of both HER and OER in a wide pH range. CoP3/Ni2P can also be used for water splitting (1.557 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) more than 40 h, superior to benchmark pairs of Pt/C and RuO2 on Ni foam.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000718271300074	34705420

Recent advance has demonstrated that the activity of electrocatalysts exhibits a strong dependence on the surface electronic structure. Herein, a series of ultrathin metal silicate hydroxide nanosheets (UMSHNs) M3Si2O5(OH)(4) (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) synthesized without surfactant are introduced as highly active OER electrocatalysts. Cobalt silicate hydroxide nanosheets show an optimal OER activity with overpotentials of 287 and 358 mV at 1 and 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Combining experimental and theoretical studies, it is found that the OER activity of UMSHNs is dominated by the metal-oxygen covalency (MOC). High OER activity can be achieved by having a moderate MOC as reflected by a sigma*-orbital (e(g)) filling near unity and moderate [3d]/[2p] ratio. Moreover, the UMSHNs exhibit favorable chemical stability under oxidation potential. This contribution provides a scientific guidance for further development of active metal silicate hydroxide catalysts.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11				2575-0356		WOS:000607203200001

However, inadequate cognition about the electrochemical activation-induced structure evolution and effect of the residual anions leads to insufficient theoretical guidance for the rational design of highly effective catalyst. Herein, Ni3S2 nanoflakes vertically grown on Ni foam (Ni3S2/ NF) are successfully achieved to behave as the pre-catalyst. Systematic experimental investigation and theoretical calculation endorse that stepwise S leaching combined with OH- adsorption is conducive to boosting the structure evolution of Ni3S2/NF into NiOOH/Ni3S2/NF. In addition, the residual SO42anchored on the surface of reconstructed catalyst could enhance the adsorption of reactive intermediates and decrease the stepwise energy barrier for OER. As a result, the reconstructed NiOOH/Ni3S2/NF exhibits superior OER performance with an overpotential of 255.4 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm2. In addition, remarkable electrocatalytic performance for overall water splitting is achieved with NiOOH/ Ni3S2/NF and Ni3S2/NF as anode and cathode, respectively, featured for 1.57 V (vs. RHE) to powering overall water electrolysis with a current density of 10 mA cm2. This work supplies valuable insights for fundamental understanding and rational construction of efficient nickel-based OER catalyst. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

However, most of reported successful catalysts have a small tested range and the current density is usually less than 100 mA cm(-2), which is far from meeting the actual application demands. This review first summarizes the recent reported self-supported transition metal-based catalysts that can run stably at high current density. Where their catalytic performance in three important reactions of electrolytic cells: hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and overall water splitting (OWS) have been introduced, respectively. Meanwhile, some design requirements, relevant test conditions and potential conversion in exploring large current catalysts have been generalized. Finally, some perspectives for further development of large current density-based electrocatalysts are proposed. This work may provide the guidance and reference for rational design and exploitation of self-supported high current density electrocatalysts, thus further promoting the large-scale application of water splitting.

Here, we show that promoting the fraction of the high-surface-energy facet of the catalyst is an effective approach to increase the Li-O-2 OER activity. We designed a series of chromiumoxide (Cr2O3) with varying fractions of high-energy facet by inhibiting the growth of the low-energy facet, i.e., (012) of Cr2O3. Remarkably, the Li-O-2 OER activity of Cr2O3 increases with increasing fraction of high-energy facet and demonstrates higher activity than the state-of-the-art precious metal Ru/Vulcan carbon catalyst by more than 120 mV, representing one of the most active Li-O-2 OER catalysts. Our study demonstrates that surface energy of catalyst is a key material property governing the Li-O-2 OER activity and offers an effective catalyst design strategy for rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries.									34	0	0	0	2	0	34			2542-4351			WOS:000441627400016

Heteroatom-doped carbon materials have been extensively employed as efficient electrocatalysts for independent HER or OER processes, while those as the bifunctional catalysts for simultaneously generating H-2 and O-2 by splitting water have been seldom reported. Inspired by the unparalleled virtues of polydopamine, the authors devise the facile synthesis of nitrogen and sulfur dual-doped carbon nanotubes with in situ, homogenous and high concentration sulfur doping. The newly developed dual-doped electrocatalysts display superb bifunctional catalytic activities for both HER and OER in alkaline solutions, outperforming all other reported carbon counterparts. Experimental characterizations confirm that the excellent performance is attributed to the multiple doping together with efficient mass and charge transfer, while theoretical computations reveal the promotion effect of secondary sulfur dopant to enhance the spin density of dual-doped samples and consequently to form highly electroactive sites for both HER and OER.									258	15	1	0	11	0	261			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000401719900006

A charge compensation was realized by doping octahedral Ni2+ ions into the Co3O4 lattice, where the oxygen vacancies generate to maintain the electric neutrality. The oxygen vacancies lead to the local lattice distortion of Co3O4 , trigger the concomitant electron redistribution, as well as optimize the d-band center of Ni-Co3O4 . Then, the accelerated charge transfer and matter conversion boost the HER kinetics of Ni-Co3O4 . As expected, the obtained Ni-Co3O4 catalyst exhibits the brilliant HER catalytic performance with a low over-potential of only 47 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and a Tafel slope of 46 mV dec(-1). The density function theory calcu-lations verify that this charge compensation strategy could efficiently promote the water dissociation and hydrogen transformation kinetics.

The complexity of the origin and evolution of photosynthesis is a result of multiple photosynthetic components having independent evolutionary pathways. Indeed, evolutionary scenarios have been established for only a few photosynthetic components. Phylogenetic analysis of Mg-tetrapyrrole biosynthesis genes indicates that most anoxygenic photosynthetic organisms are ancestral to oxygen-evolving cyanobacteria and that the purple bacterial lineage may contain the most ancestral form of this pigment biosynthesis pathway. The evolutionary path of type I and type II reaction center apoproteins is still unresolved owing to the fact that a unified evolutionary tree cannot be generated for these divergent reaction center subunits. However, evidence for a cytochrome h origin for the type 11 reaction center apoproteins is emerging. Based on the combined information for both photopigments and reaction centers, a unified theory for the evolution of reaction center holoproteins is provided. Further insight into the evolution of photosynthesis will have to rely on additional broader sampling of photosynthesis genes from divergent photosynthetic bacteria.									136	6	2	0	112	0	152			1040-2519			WOS:000177183300021	12221987

The well crystalline, porous nature of NiCo2O4, NiCo2 S-4, and NiCo2Se4 electrocatalysts with one dimensional (1D) structural morphology affords overpotentials of 346 mV, 309 mV and 270 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. In particular, NiCo2Se4 exhibits a low overpotential as well as a smaller Tafel slope of 63 mV dec(-1), leading to robust stability in alkaline conditions. The abundant active sites, large mass and size of NiCo2Se4 enhances the performance of the OER. This type of selenide-based material with low toxicity is also an advantage for eco-friendly applications.									10	1	0	0	1	0	11			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000533394700001	32244232

Herein, we report a facile method to fabricate urchin like CoP nanocrystals (NCs) as E catalyst for both HER and ORR with desirable electrocatalytic activities and long-term stability. The urchin-like CoP NCs with a diameter of 5 mu m were successfully prepared by a hydrothermal reaction following a phosphidation treatment in N-2 atmosphere and present excellent HER catalytic performance with a low onset overpotential of SO mV) a small Tafel slope of 46 mV/decade, and an exceptional low overpotential of similar to 180 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) with a mass loading density of 0.28 mg/cm(2). Meanwhile, a remarkable ORR catalytic activity was observed with a half-potential of 0.7 V and an onset potential of 0.8 V at 1600 rpm and a scan rate of 5 mV s(-1). More importantly, the urchin-like CoP NCs present superior stability and keep their catalytic activity for at least 10 000 CV cycles for HER in 0.5 M H2SO4 and over 30 000 s for ORR in 0.1 M KOH, which is ascribed to their robust three-dimensional structure. This urchin-like CoP NCs might be a promising replacement to the Pt-based electrocatalysts in water splitting and fuel cells.									373	25	0	0	18	0	377			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000364725400066	26474359

The complicated physicochemical processes, including mass transport, charge transport, and three simultaneous electrochemical reactions (the hydrogen peroxide reduction, hydrogen peroxide oxidation, and oxygen reduction reactions) are considered. The model is experimentally validated and shows good agreement with the literature experimental data. The model is then applied to the study of the mixed potential by varying the current density. It is found that the largest potential loss due to the HPOR occurs under the open-circuit condition (OCC), and the potential loss decreases with the superficial current density. In addition, the numerical results suggest that under the OCC, an increase in the concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and H+ ions leads to a decrease in the potential loss, but an increase in the hydrogen peroxide decomposition rate and the oxygen evolution rate.

The RuO2 films were prepared on FTO substrates by electrodeposition or RF magnetron sputtering technique. The obtained films were annealed at various temperatures. In both cases, the as-prepared films or the 200 C annealed film had an amorphous structure, whereas the films annealed at 300 degrees C and over were crystallized to rutile structure. The analysis of the Tafel slope indicated that the rate-determining step in the oxygen evolution reaction on the amorphous RuO2 was the combination of the adjacent Ru-OH groups, whereas that on crystalline RuO2 was the dissociation of O-H bond in Ru-OH group. The onset potentials of the amorphous RuO2 films for oxygen evolution were shifted toward the negative side by 0.06-0.03 V from those for the rutile crystalline samples. The shift of the onset potential is probably attributed to the structural flexibility which is characteristic of the amorphous surface. This result suggested that the electrocatalytic activity of amorphous RuO2 for oxygen evolution was higher than that of rutile crystalline RuO2. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) seriously impede their practical implementations. Herein, heteroatom-doping strategies with respect to lithiophilicity chemistry are investigated to improve the catalytic performance of carbon materials during ORR process through first-principles calculations. The binding energy, electronegativity, electric dipole moment and lithium diffusion barrier are found to be key factors that govern the lithiophilicity of doped heteroatoms. Among all non-metallic elements, pyrrolic nitrogen, carboxylic group oxygen and ketone group oxygen doped graphene nanoribbons exhibit improved thermodynamics and kinetics of ORR, giving rise to uniform deposition of lithium oxides for further favorable OER. This work provides insights into the mechanisms of ORR as well as the formation of lithium oxides and a guidance to design an effectively catalytic cathode for lithium-oxygen batteries.

Here, we report a three-dimensional (3D) nanonetwork as noble-metal-free electrode consisting of nickel cobalt diselenide (NiCoSe2) nanobrush arrays on Ni foam (NF) through the initial hydrothermal reaction and subsequent thermal selenization process. Introducing ammonium fluoride as surface controller, different NiCoSe2 hierarchical architecture can be modulated from nanorods, nanobrush to nanosheets. The unique brush-like NiCoSe2 possesses high surface area for mass transfer, rough surface with rich active sites, 3D nanostructure preventing the accumulation of O-2 bubbles. Compared to NiCoSe2 nanorods/NF, NiCoSe2 nanosheets/NF and commercial RuO2, NiCoSe2 nanobrush/NF exhibits an enhanced OER performance in alkaline media to reach a low overpotential of 274 mV at the current density of 10 mA/cm(2), small Tafel slope and a long-term stability. The developed 3D nanonetwork highlights the nanoscale engineering and offers a promising alternative to noble metal catalysts for electrochemical water oxidation. (C) 2017 Science China Press.

In this work, nonprecious chromium dopant is introduced into the self-supported CoFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) on nickel foam (Cr-CoFe LDHs/NF) via a facile one-step hydrothermal method, which exhibits a preeminent electrocatalytic activity toward the OER with an ultralow overpotential of 238 mV to obtain 10 mA cm(-2) and a high stability after cyclic voltammetry for 5000 cycles in alkaline solution (1 m KOH). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations unveil that Cr dopants as new active sites could improve the electron-donation ability of the resultant Cr-CoFe LDHs due to the smaller electronegativity of Cr in comparison with Fe and Co. Therefore, the scaling relation of adsorption energy among four oxygen intermediates is broken and consequently the OER performance is further promoted. This work provides a strategy to develop efficient metal layered double hydroxide OER catalysts.									78	7	0	0	10	0	78			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000476180000001	31304683

In addition, the ambiguity of the water splitting reaction (hydrogen evolution and OER) is a hurdle in the manufacture of suitable catalysts for the efficient water electrolysis process. Here, the synthesis of iron oxide/iron phosphide (Fe2O3/FeP) heterostructure and its counterparts Fe2O3 and FeP as cheap electrocatalysts for water electrolysis is presented. Characterization techniques such as powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were used to analyze the structure of these electrocatalysts. Heterostructure Fe2O3/FeP has been shown to be a more active electrocatalyst than its counterparts. It initiates OER at a remarkably low potential of 1.49 V vs. reverse hydrogen electrode (RHE). For this electrocatalyst, a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) is achieved at an overpotential of 264 mV for OER in 1.0 M potassium hydroxide solution and the value of the Tafel slope is 47 mV dec(-1), outperforming its complements (Fe2O3 and FeP) under similar conditions. The results obtained are superior to those of previously reported Fe-based OER electrocatalysts. The Fe2O3/FeP electrocatalyst has proven its long-term stability by driving OER at 1.65 V (vs. RHE) for about 12.5 h. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The structural and morphological characterizations of these IrO2 NRs were carried out by powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopic techniques. Compared to commercial IrO2 nanoparticles (IrO2 NPs) and previous reports, these IrO2 NRs show enhanced electrocatalytic activity to oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions by passing either N-2 or O-2 gas in a 0.5 M KOH electrolyte before electrochemical measurements, including cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Specifically, the current densities from the as-synthesized IrO2 NRs and commercial IrO2 NPs were measured in 0.5 M KOH electrolyte to be 70 and 58 (OER, deaerated, at 0.6 V versus Ag/AgCl), 71 and 61 (OER, O-2, from -0.10 to 1.0 V versus Ag/AgCl at 50 mV/s), and 25 and 14 (HER, deaerated, at -1.4 V versus Ag/AgCl) mA/cm(2), respectively. These results are comparable with, and in most cases, higher than reported data in the literature. Therefore, the current study reports not only a novel synthetic process for IrO2 but also a high efficient IrO2 nanostructure, and it is expected that these IrO2 NRs can serve as a benchmark in the development of active OER and HER (photo) electrocatalysts for various applications.

Herein, novel cobalt carbonate hydroxide nanorods are synthesized by facile low-temperature precipitation. The nanorods are networked to form mesoporous structure with a large surface area (291.4 m(2) g(-1)) and high pore volume (1.06 cm(3) g(-1)). The obtained catalyst reaches a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with an overpotential of a 320 mV and a Tafel slope of 39 mV dec(-1). Moreover, OER activity is improved after stability test, while the overpotential drops down to 313 mV. This increase in activity is explained by in-situ conversion from carbonate to hydroxide, resulting in an increase of active sites. The synthesis route allows an efficient way for obtaining novel cobalt-based OER electrocatalyst, and the enhancement in catalytic activity after stability test also gives a new insight for designing high-performance OER electrodes.

It is highly challenging to apply CPs as electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on account of insufficient catalytic efficiency and relatively poor stability of current electrocatalysts. Herein, through a mixed-metal strategy, one-dimensional CoxNi1-x-HIPA with dual active sites was synthesized and studied for OER electrocatalysts. By changing the metal ratio of CoxNi1-x-HIPA, the OER performance was well regulated. The optimized Co1/2Ni1/2-HIPA exhibited minimum reaction activation energy, and represented an overpotential of 367 mV to reach 10 mA/cm(2) at 25 degrees C. Moreover, an overpotential of 314 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) was obtained from Co1/2Ni1/2-HIPA at 55 degrees C. This mixed-metal strategy provides a feasible way for adjusting the electronic states of the electrocatalysts to improve the electrocatalytic OER performance.

The synthetic methodology is based on the facile redox reaction between Au(III) and Fe(0) in the presence of gold nanoparticle as a seed at room temperature in an aqueous medium. The synthesis results in the deposition of Au nanoparticles on the surface of iron oxide layers. Composition variation in the nanocomposites was obtained by controlling the seed amount and reducing agent. These nanocomposites are used as electrocatalysts for the thermodynamically unfavorable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) from water. Among the nano-composites, the most efficient OER activity was observed from the nanocomposite 12.

The distribution of the OER site is affected by many factors, such as properties of CL, operation parameters, procedures, etc. To study the effects of properties of CLs on the distribution of OER site on the CL, and consequently affect the performance of PEMECs, CLs with different sheet resistances are tested under different operation conditions. The phenomena of OER on CLs are captured by a high-speed and micro-scale visualization system in-situ and analysed coupled with electrochemical results. The results show that both sheet resistance and wettability of CLs have significant impact on the distribution of the OER site, which can help optimize the design of membrane electrode assembly and improve the operating parameters for electrochemical devices.

The mechanism of the multistepped reaction, especially four-electron oxidation to O-2, has not yet been understood. Although some intermediate states have been detected in transient spectroscopy, O-2 evolution kinetics remain unknown at the end of consecutive reaction steps. We apply operando O-2 detection with a microelectrode to determine the absolute evolution rate on a highly efficient SrTiO3 photocatalyst film casted on a glass plate. The evolution rate was determined with a time resolution of 0.1 s, which was improved by 1000 times compared with that in widely used gas-chromatographic detection. The observed rate did not respond instantaneously to excitation light irradiation. When light was turned on, the photocatalyst film was inactive for evolution and light-activated in seconds. It was proposed that the first absorbed photons were consumed to fill trap states on SrTiO3 surface and then the latter photons drove steady O-2 evolution. When excitation light stopped, the O-2 evolution rate exponentially decayed in seconds. The microelectrode method demonstrated herein will be useful for understanding many other reaction kinetics at liquid-solid interfaces.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900001

In this work, we report rhodium selenide (Rh3Se4) nanoparticles as a promising ORR electrocatalyst due to the incorporation of Se atoms that weakened the binding strength between Rh and oxygen. Also, the formed Rh-Se bonds yield more positively charged Rh atoms favorable for breaking the *OOH intermediate to *O species due to the higher oxophilicity. Moreover, negligible degradation in ORR performance is recorded after 5000 potential cycles owing to the overly strong electronic interplay between Se and Rh atoms. A 3 times higher zinc-air battery performance is recorded compared to that of Pt/C, demonstrating the superior ORR performance of Rh3Se4/C.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2398-4902			WOS:000716522500001

Minimizing the size of the transition metal nanoparticles and creating highly porous structures are deemed imperative in maximizing the utilization of active sites of M-N/C materials. However, agglomeration of metallic particles into a bulk phase and shrinkage of the porous structures have always been inevitable during the annealing treatment process, severely impairing the overall efficacy of these catalysts. In this study, cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) were introduced for carrying well-dispersed Co nanoparticles (9 nm), while also enriching a special bimodal distribution of micropores and mesopores. Benefiting from the homogeneous and ample active sites exposed in the conductive N-implanted porous carbon scaffold, the elaborately derived CoA@CNC-700 electrocatalyst displays extraordinary catalytic activity with respect to ORR and OER in alkaline electrolyte. Impressively, such bifunctional catalyst can endow the rechargeable Zn-air batteries with a larger power density (187 mW cm(-2)), a superior specific capacity (782 mA h g(-1)), and prolonged charge-discharge cycles in comparison with the commercial Pt/C + RuO2 mixed catalysts, which highlights its great potential for practical applications.									29	2	0	0	3	0	29			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000517663800051

Developing economic and durable bifunctional ORR and OER electrocatalysts as substitute for noble-metal based catalysts, are urgently expected to reduce the industrial cost. Herein, a strategy towards synthesizing cobalt nanoparticles embedded N-doped carbon hollow nanocages (Co@NPC-H) by ion exchanging is reported. The Co@NPC-H nanocage structures integrate the high activity of heteroatoms doped catalytic active sites with the hollow structure for high exposure ratio of the active sites, exhibiting superior electroctalytic performance to noble-metal catalyst for both ORR and OER with the application potential of 860 mV when used as bifunctional catalyst, much smaller than other reported electrocatalysts, making Co@NPC-H a promising candidate as efficient air electrode in Zn-air batteries.

Owing to various coordinated sites of divalent/trivalent metals ions and surface conditions (morphology and defects), it is a great challenge to have a fair assessment of the electrocatalytic performance of spinel systems. Herein, we demonstrated a series of MFe2O4 (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Zn) with a well-controlled morphology to achieve a comprehensive study of electrocatalytic activity toward OER. By utilizing several in situ analyses, we could conclude a universal rule that the activities for OER in the metal oxide systems were determined by the occurrence of a phase transformation, and this structural transformation could work well in both crystallographic sites (Td and Oh sites). Additionally, the divalent metal ion significantly dominated the formation of oxyhydroxide through an epitaxial relationship, which depended on the atomic arrangement at the interface of spinel and metal oxyhydroxide, while trivalent metal ions remained unchanged as a host lattice. The metal oxyhydroxide was formed during a redox reaction rather than being formed during OER. The occurrence of the redox reaction seems to accompany a remarkable increase in resistance and capacitance might result from the structural transformation from spinel to metal oxyhydroxide. We believe that the approaching strategies and information obtained in the present study can offer a guide to designing a promising electrocatalytic system towards the oxygen evolution reaction and other fields.									61	1	0	0	5	0	61			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000399004700007	28272620

The materials have been thoroughly characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) spectrometry, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The MnO2 nano shapes are used as a model system for examining the shape-influenced bifunctional electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline medium. The bi-functional role has been investigated by cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry with rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE) techniques. It is found that alpha-MnO2 nano-wires possess enhanced electrocatalytic activity compared to other two shapes namely nano-tubes and nano-particles despite the nano-tubes having a much higher specific surface area. The insight of bi-functional electrocatalytic activity is analysed in terms of catalyst surface with the help of first principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations based on the fact of surface energies and adsorption of water on the surface for a facile reaction.

Metal oxyhyroxides are widely acted as co-catalyst for photoelectrocatalysis oxygen evolution reaction. Here, we firstly report the peryleno[1,12-bcd] thiophene sulfone-based linear co-polymer PS-5 for photocatalytic overall water splitting by photo-depositing simple and low-cost co-catalyst FeOOH under the visible-light illumination. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results indicated clearly that the oxygen vacancies-rich beta-FeOOH can effectively promote the separation of photo-generated excitons and provide active sites for photocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. As a result, the average H-2 and O-2 production rates of optimized PS-5/beta-FeOOH-0.2M reach at similar to 170 and similar to 76.6 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), respectively, with a stoichiometric ratio at about 2:1.

To reduce the OER overpotential, precious ruthenium and iridium oxides are most commonly used as anode electrocatalyst. Here we report marked reduction in overpotential for the OER using transition metal (TM) doped TiO2 nanocrystals (NCs). This reduction in overpotential is attributed to d-orbitals splitting of the doped TMs in the TM-doped TiO2 NCs and their interactions with the oxyradicals (intermediates of OER) facilitating the OER. The d-orbital spitting of TMs in TM-doped TiO2 NCs is evident from the change in original pearl white color of undoped TiO2 NCs and UVvis absorption spectra.									99	4	0	0	3	0	101			1932-7447			WOS:000347360200005

First, we briefly introduced the fundamentals of the anode and cathode reaction for AWE, i.e., the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. Next, the most popular in situ/operando approaches for characterizing AWE catalysts, including hard and soft XAS, ambient-pressure XPS, liquid and identical location TEM, electrochemical mass spectrometry, and Raman spectroscopy were thoroughly summarized. Subsequently, we carefully discussed the principles, computational methods, applications, and combinations of DFT with machine learning for modeling NPCs and predicting the alkaline OER and HER. With the improved understanding of the structure-property-performance relationship of NPCs for AWE, we proceeded to overview their current development, summarising state-of-the-art design strategies to boost their activity. In addition, advances in various extensively investigated NPCs for AWE were evaluated. By conveying these methods, progress, insights, and perspectives, this review will contribute to a better understanding and rational development of non-precious AWE electrocatalysts for hydrogen production.									180	8	0	0	9	0	184			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000598713800010	33140778

In this work, 3D porous Ni-Fe sulfide nanosheets supported on nickel foam (Ni-Fe-S/NF) were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. The optimized Ni3S2-FeS/NF-2 electrode realized ultra-high efficiency for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Benefiting from the unique 3D porous nanosheets structure and the strong electronic interactions between Ni3S2 and FeS through component regulation, low overpotentials of 253 and 262 mV are required to drive a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER, respectively. Importantly, Ni3S2-FeS/NF-2 bifunctional catalyst only needs 1.55 and 1.75 V at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) respectively and works continuously for at least 100 h. The work thus provides an extraordinary promising catalyst for OWS and can be envisioned of potential for large-scale applications. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

In the present work, we report the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of a metal-oxide catalyst, Mn3O4, and study the effect of transition metal doping (Cu and Fe) on the OER activity of Mn3O4 in an alkaline medium. The Mn3O4 and transition metal (Cu and Fe) doped Mn3O4 catalysts were prepared using a hydrothermal reaction technique. Powder x-ray diffraction studies revealed that these compounds adopt a tetragonal spinel structure with an I4(1)/amd space group, and this is further supported with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic measurements. These results are further supported by high-resolution transmission electron microscopic measurements. The electrochemical measurements of these catalysts reveal that the transition metal (Cu and Fe) doped Mn3O4 catalysts show better OER activity than pristine Mn3O4 (MO). The transition metal (Cu and Fe) doped Mn3O4 catalysts exhibit lower overpotential for the OER (eta (MCO) = 300 mV and eta (MFO) = 240 mV) than the MO (eta (MO) = 350 mV) catalyst. The better performance of Fe-doped Mn3O4 is further supported by turnover frequency calculations.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2399-1984		WOS:000813324500001

Thus, relatively expensive nickel-based electrodes are used in industrial alkaline water electrolysis. We show that an iron substrate can be rendered stable and electrocatalytically active for the oxygen evolution reaction by nano-scale surface modification with nickel. The electrocatalytic activity of such a surface-modified iron electrode is comparable to the recently-reported nickel-based catalysts. The electrocatalytic activity is due to a 50-nanometer layer of a high-surface area a-nickel hydroxide on the iron electrode. The nickel modification renders the iron electrode electrically-conductive, prevents dielectric breakdown, and thus endows anodic stability. The electrocatalytic activity is unchanged even after 1000 hours of continuous operation. The temperature of preparation is critical, as excessive dehydration of the hydroxide layer results in nickel ferrite formation and a drastic reduction in electrocatalytic activity. We report significant insight into the surface chemical composition and structure of the catalyst layer by X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy, Photoelectron Spectroscopy, and Transmission Electron Microscopy. Electrochemical kinetics analysis suggests that surface hydroxo-intermediates react with the hydroxide ions from the solution to evolve oxygen. Thus, the surface-modified iron substrates present an opportunity for improving the performance and reducing the cost of alkaline water electrolysis systems. (C) The Author(s) 2018.

We developed metallic cobalt encased N-doped carbon hybrid nanomaterial with remarkable electrochemical activity from a three-dimensional cobalt (II) based N-containing MOF as a sacrificial template by carbonization. All the carbonized materials have been characterized by various analytical methods to establish the structural and morphological integrity. N-doped graphitic carbon embedded with metallic cobalt (CoNC-900) revealed promising electrochemical activity towards OER in alkaline and hydrogen evolution in acidic media with good stability. Among the series of carbonized MOF material CoNC-900 is designated as highly efficient electrode materials with low overpotential/Tafel slope and superior stability for OER. Standard current density of 10 mA cm(-2) was attained at a smaller overpotential (210 mV) by CoNC-900 compared to state-of-the-art RuO2 electrocatalyst (280 mV) indicating OER kinetics response is significantly higher showing the superior activity outperforming most reported electrocatalysts. In view of the best OER performance, experiments have been performed to gauge the electrochemically active surface area, stability/durability and charge transfer resistance (Rct), which also supports the efficient electrocatalytic performance observed in CoNC-900.									19	1	0	0	1	0	19			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000564113100013

AISI Ni42 steel is upon harsh anodization converted into a bifunctional electrocatalyst. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are highly efficiently and steadfast catalyzed at pH 7, 13, 14, 14.6 (OER) and at pH 0, 1, 13, 14, 14.6 (HER), respectively. The current density taken from long-term OER measurements in pH 7 buffer solution upon the electro-activated steel at 491 mV overpotential (eta) is around four times higher (4 mA cm(-2)) in comparison with recently developed OER electrocatalysts. The very strong voltage-current behavior of the catalyst shown in OER polarization experiments at both pH 7 and at pH 13 are even superior to those known for IrO2 center dot RuO2. No degradation of the catalyst is detected even when conditions close to standard industrial operations are applied to the catalyst. A stable Ni-, Fe-oxide based passivating layer sufficiently protects the bare metal for further oxidation. Quantitative charge to oxygen (OER) and charge to hydrogen (HER) conversion are confirmed. High-resolution XPS spectra show that most likely gamma-NiO(OH) and FeO(OH) are the catalytic active OER and NiO is the catalytic active HER species.									69	0	0	0	2	0	69			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000384809100006

Attributed to their sluggish kinetics, the principle and concept to achieve efficient electrocatalysts for a sustainable catalytic process, especially bi-functional electrocatalysts with abundant active centers and 3D conductive scaffolds for both OER and ORR, are strongly considered. In this contribution, rather than physically mixing active catalyst flakes with conductive fillers, a hybrid electrocatalyst with 'active point-conductive line-active point' connections was proposed and validated. As a proof-of-concept, Co-based active sites embedded on layered double oxide (LDO) substrates interlinked with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were realized and exhibited a superior bi-functional activity for both OER and ORR in an alkaline electrolyte. The LDO/CNT hybrids catalyzed the OER to reach 10.0 mA cm(-2) at 1.64 V vs. RHE, and the ORR to reach 3.0 mA cm(-2) at 0.65 V vs. RHE, with a potential gap of 0.99 V. Such model catalysts of LDO/CNT hybrids even delivered a better bifunctional performance than routine noble metal catalysts (e.g. Pt/C and IrO2). The novel strategy of combining metal compounds and carbon nanomaterials through 'point-line-point' configurations can be applied to other hierarchical composites with multi-building blocks, aiming at promising applications in energy storage and environmental protection.									52	7	0	0	2	0	52			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000371077600025

However, most of the previous studies were limited by applying pure oxygen in the cathode, sacrificing the gravimetric and volumetric energy density. Here, we develop a real sodium-"air" battery, in which the rechargeability of the battery relies on the reversible reaction of the formation of sodium peroxide dihydrate (Na2O2 center dot 2H(2)O). After an oxygen evolution reaction catalyst is applied, the charge overpotential is largely reduced to achieve a high energy efficiency. The sodium-air batteries deliver high areal capacity of 4.2 mAh.cm(-2) and have a decent cycle life of 100 cycles. The oxygen crossover effect is largely suppressed by replacing the oxygen with air, whereas the dense solid electrolyte interphase formed on the sodium anode further prolongs the cycle life.									19	1	0	0	0	0	18			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000541691200081	32426983

The aim of this study is to reduce the overpotential and thus energy consumption. Toward this aim, transition metal sulfide catalyst (marked as S5-40 doped Ni4Mo) is successfully prepared by a fast one-step electrodeposition process on a copper foam (CF) substrate. The S-20 doped Ni4Mo/CF catalyst displays an exceedingly low overpotential of 140 and -128 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for (oxygen evolution reaction) and (hydrogen evolution reaction), respectively. The S-20 doped Ni4Mo/CF can be powered by a commercial AA alkaline battery (1.5 V) in 1.0 m KOH. It shows a lower cell voltage of 1.595 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting (OWS). Up to 60 h of stability testing, compared with the S-20 doped Ni4Mo/CF catalyst before electrolysis, their performance is improved by 15.5% and 41.1% at 2 and -0.7 V versus RHE, respectively. This study offers an avenue to fabricate transition metal sulfide bi-functional catalysts for OWS and provides deep insights into the relationships among the S-doping Ni4Mo at the 1.0 m KOH electrolyte physical characterization and electrocatalytic activity.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2196-7350			WOS:000721844300001

An alternative, thermodynamically equivalent approach is to use a metal oxide as an oxygen carrier (oxidizer) and then recycle the carrier following its reduction by exothermic reoxidation in air. This process, termed chemical looping combustion (CLC), places many requirements on the oxygen carrier. Here, we explore how to evaluate the relationship between the microscopic properties of an oxygen carrier and its performance in CLC. In this paper, systematically doped Bi2O3 were synthesized as oxygen carriers for the oxidation of carbon. In operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction and online mass spectrometry enable us to monitor both the phase evolution in the solid and the production of gaseous products. Initiation temperature and reaction kinetics were deduced on the basis of the Xray diffraction peak intensity change. Results show that lower metal oxygen bond energy and higher oxygen vacancy concentration of doped Bi2O3 led to lower onset temperature, faster reaction rate, and smaller activation energy for carbon oxidation. These results provide important insights into manipulating the atomic properties of oxygen carrier for CLC applications.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1932-7447			WOS:000431151200010

The key to the pursuit of efficient electrocatalysts is to design them with high surface area and more active sites. In this work, we have successfully synthesized a highly stable and active NiCo2S4 nanowire array on a Ni-foam substrate (NiCo2S4 NW/NF) via a two-step hydrothermal synthesis approach. This NiCo2S4 NW/NF exhibits overpotential as low as 275 mV, delivering a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) with a low Tafel slope of 89 mV dec(-1) and superior long-term stability for 20 h in 1M KOH electrolyte. The outstanding performance is ascribed to the inherent activity of the binder-free deposited, vertically aligned nanowire structure, which provides a large number of electrochemically active surface sites, accelerating electron transfer, and simultaneously enhancing the diffusion of electrolyte.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1225-0562	2287-7258		WOS:000538181100001

The elimination of demetallation is pivotal for extending the life but still incapable due to the ambiguous mechanism. Herein, we show that the structure of FeN4 site and its structural evolution during ORR has the significant influence. The end-of-test/in-situ Mossbauer spectroscopy and density functional theory study reveal that D1 mainly contributes to the ORR activity but suffers severe demetallation, which is likely due to the instability of FeN4C8. The faster demetallation during ORR, especially at higher potential, can be attributed to the weaker coordination of FeN4 induced by oxygenated intermediate and electric field according to ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, the binding energy of Fe-N bond is introduced to describe the influence of structure and structural evolution and give guidance to the improvement of stability.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000787901400003

However, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) at the cathodes results in large polarization and low energy efficiency. Although advances have been achieved in electrode material designs and battery configurations, large discharge/charge voltage gaps remain. The introduction of light into Li-O-2 batteries has been demonstrated to boost the reaction kinetics of the ORR/OER, leading to enhanced electrochemical performances, but the understanding of the photoelectrochemical process at oxygen cathodes is limited.

J	Cheng, Zifang; Pi, Yecan; Shao, Qi; Huang, Xiaoqing								Boron-doped amorphous iridium oxide with ultrahigh mass activity for acidic oxygen evolution reaction								SCIENCE CHINA-MATERIALS				64	12			2958	2966		10.1007/s40843-021-1687-5		JUN 2021		DEC 2021	2021	Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as the primary anodic reaction, plays a critical role in many electrochemical energy conversion processes. As the state-of-the-art OER catalysts, iridium-based materials are largely hindered from practical applications mainly due to the extreme scarcity of iridium. Here we demonstrate the successful fabrication of boron-doped amorphous iridium oxide (IrOx-B) via a facile boric acid-assisted method, which realizes an ultrahigh OER mass activity of 2779 A g(Ir)(-1) at 300 mV overpotential, representing one of the best acidic OER catalysts reported so far. It is found that boric acid can not only facilitate the exposure of Ir, but also dope the amorphous IrOx with a form of metaborate, which could further modify the electronic and local ligand structure of Ir for the improved intrinsic activity. Interestingly, the reported strategy is universal that can be applied to improve other metal oxide OER catalysts, highlighting a versatile strategy for creating high-performance electro-catalysts with ultrahigh mass activity for OER and beyond.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000659393800001

Herein, we present an unique structure transformation phenomenon for the fabrication of alloy Cu3Pt nanoframes with polyhedral morphology. This strategy starts with the preparation of polyhedral Cu-Pt nanoparticles with a core-shell construction upon the anisotropic growth of Pt on multiply twinned Cu seed particles, which are subsequently transformed into alloy Cu3Pt nanoframes due to the Kirkendall effect between the Cu core and Pt shell. The as-prepared alloy Cu3Pt nanoframes possess the rhombic dodecahedral morphology of their core-shell parents after the structural evolution. In particular, the resulting alloy Cu3Pt nanoframes are more effective for oxygen reduction reaction but ineffective for methanol oxidation reaction in comparison with their original Cu-Pt core-shell precursors.									82	12	0	0	5	0	83			2045-2322			WOS:000341942300003	25231376

The oxygen vacancy of synthesized MoOx is confirmed by Raman, XPS, and XRD measurements. MoOx/Mo electrode exhibits high active for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution. The HER performance of MoOx/Mo can be further improved by electrodepositing of small amount of Pt nanoparticles on MoOx. Pt-MoOx/Mo electrode shows high HER performance, which is close to the performance of Pt.

In this work, we report a facile, economical, and scalable strategy for the synthesis of amorphous layered double hydroxide (A-NiFeLDH/CC) with rich oxygen defects. The A-NiFeLDH/CC electrode exhibits an excellent OER activity with an onset potential of 1.32 V (vs. RHE) and a low overpotential of 290 mV at the current density of 50 mA cm(-2). Besides, the A-NiFeLDH/CC electrode can steadily electrolyze for over 150 h with negligible potential variation at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Intriguingly, this resulted amorphous catalyst undergoes a rapid self-reconstruction process during OER that produces crystalline metal hydroxide layer with rich O-defects.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000842572500002

I. VIMP and SECM								ARCHAEOMETRY											10.1111/arcm.12785		MAY 2022			2022	Voltammetry of immobilized particles (VIMP) and scanning electrochemical microscopy techniques are combined to study nanosamples from 60 Apulian red-figured pottery objects from six Apulian archaeological sites (Altamura, Arpi, Conversano, Egnazia, Monte Sannace, Taranto) and three Attic samples from Pella. The VIMP signatures corresponding to the electrocatalytic effect of microparticulate deposits of the clay body and the black gloss on the oxygen evolution reaction and the oxygen reduction reaction are obtained. These signatures provide information on the reducing/oxidizing conditions of firing. The combination of the above voltammetric data permits us to distinguish between Apulian production and Attic importations as well as to discriminate the productions from different archaeological sites or even within different technologies in samples from the same site.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0003-813X	1475-4754		WOS:000794300300001

Owing to the holey structure along with the optimal electrochemically active surface area and active sites, the as-prepared NiSx FHF showed an impressive bifunctional electrocatalytic performance toward both oxygen evolution and reduction reactions. The holey and freestanding features provide the NiSx FHF with promising characteristics to be used as an ideal air-breathing cathode in flexible Zn-air batteries (ZABs). As a proof-of-concept, the rationally designed NiSx FHF achieved remarkable rechargeability and flexibility in a ZAB configuration.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1948-7185			WOS:000435026100005	29741902

However, constructing a water electrolyzer using a sole catalyst without compromising either its oxygen evolution reaction (OER) or hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance is still challenging. In this study, a simple strategy is developed to integrate 2 D and 0 D CoP in the same metal-organic framework precursor-derived hollow N-doped carbon nanotube-assembled polyhedron (HNCNP). The unique hierarchical structure endows the resulting nanocomposite with both the advantages of more exposed active sites for 2 D and large surface-to-volume ratio for 0 D materials, whereas the hollow interior could benefit the charge and mass transfer properties. Thus, CoP/HNCNP@2 D CoP exhibits outstanding OER and HER activity and a low cell voltage when employed as both the anode and cathode in a two-electrode water electrolyzer. The approach of integrating the same metal phosphide phase with diverse dimensions may inspire new ways to design hierarchical nanostructures for advanced energy conversion applications.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000531547400001	32222061

Owing to appealing chemical and structural properties, two-dimensional (2D) porous nanocomposites have been considered as the first-class candidates for water electrolysis. Herein, an effective 2D bifunctional catalyst, CoO-modified nitrogen and sulfur co-doped ultrathin porous carbon nanoplates, has been synthesized by pyrolysis of ultrathin [Co-II(Tdc)(4,4 '-Bpy)](n) (Tdc=thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylate; Bpy=4,4 '-bipyridine) nanoplates at 600 degrees C under a nitrogen atmosphere (denoted CoO/N-S-UPCNPs-600). CoO/N-S-UPCNPs-600 possesses favorable properties for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), such as a thinner thickness in ultrathin porous carbon nanoplates (UPCNPs), more defects, and a larger specific surface area. As a result, CoO/N-S-UPCNPs-600 exhibits high catalytic activity and stability towards both OER and HER in alkaline medium. Its overpotentials and Tafel slopes are as low as 240 and 110 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and as small as 62 and 94 mV dec(-1) for OER and HER, respectively. Furthermore, an alkaline water electrolyzer fabricated with CoO/N-S-UPCNPs-600 as both anodic and cathodic catalysts delivers an attractive cell potential of 1.63 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and shows no obvious degradation over 20 h. Therefore, the resultant 2D ultrathin porous nanocomposite is expected to be applied for efficient water electrolysis.									8	2	0	0	0	0	8			2196-0216			WOS:000481471800011

In the perovskite metal oxide family, we chose SrCo0.8Fe0.1Nb0.1O3.delta (SCFN) OER catalyst with excellent catalytic properties, and in order to further increase its performance. Here, we treat mesoporous SCFN perovskite electrocatalysts with H2O2. After 5 times treatment in H2O2, the specific surface area of SCFN-5 reaches 20.9 m(2) g(-1), whereas as-prepared SCFN-0 only has 2.3 m(2) g(-1). SCFN-5 catalyst shows significantly high OER catalytic activity, displaying an overpotential of 0.44 Vat 10 mA cm(-2) and charge transfer resistance (R-ct) value of 59 Omega, which are much lower than those of untreated and ball-milled SCFN samples. Our results indicate that several factors, including the high surface area, good charge transfer abilities, formation of hydrous oxide and the oxidation of Co3+ may contribute to the excellent OER activity.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000502883500019

Moreover, the optimized NiFe electrocatalyst as bifunctional electrocatalyst toward overall water splitting only needs a small cell voltage of 1.57 V to obtain 10 mA center dot cm(-2). The extremely electrocatalytic performance of NiFe electrocatalyst is attributed to the fast charge transfer kinetics, large electrochemical surface area, and the conductive nickel foam.									11	1	0	0	0	0	12			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000555722000001

The materials are synthesized via nanocasting and modified by chemical treatment with 0.1 M NaBH4 solution to enhance the defect concentration. The synthesized samples have metal and oxygen divacancies (V-Co + V-O) as the primary defect sites, as indicated by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS). Cation substitution in the spinel structure induces a higher number of oxygen vacancies. The increased number of surface defects and the synergistic effect between two incorporated metals provide a high activity in both the OER and ORR in the case of NiCo2O4 and ZnCo2O4. Especially, ZnCo2O4 exhibits the highest OER/ORR activity. The defect engineering with 0.1 M NaBH4 solution results in a metal-hydroxylated surface (M-OH) and enhanced the catalytic activity for the post-treated metal oxides in the ORR and OER. This fundamental investigation of the defective structure of the mixed metal oxides offers some useful insights into further development of highly active electrocatalysts through defect engineering methods.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000819996000001	35561262

Owing to the well-defined 2D morphology, nanometer-scale thickness, high specific surface area, and the simultaneous doping of the metal-nitrogen compounds, the as-prepared catalysts exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in both alkaline and acidic media.

Herein, a hierarchical CuO@Cu3P/CF nanowire core-shell heterostructure with transferable active centers was developed for a bifunctional electrocatalyst with high activity. In this system, the transfer of electrochemically active centers between Cu3P and CuO is used to facilitate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Particularly, Cu3P acts as the active center for HER, while the active center shifts to CuO for OER reaction, and Cu3P acts as a co-catalyst to improve the conductivity of the system. Benefit from superhydrophilicity's high electrochemical surface area and synergistic effect of CuO core and Cu3P shell, and CuO@Cu3P/CF shown significant catalytic activity for hydrogen or oxygen evolution, requiring low overpotentials of 144 and 267 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, the assembled CuO@Cu3P/CF-based electrolyzer exhibit excellent overall water splitting performance with a low operating voltage of 1.75 Vat 10 mA cm(-2) and a negligible decrease in catalytic activity.

Shorter UVO exposures lead to oxygen adsorption and doping; longer exposures lead to significant defect generation and then to etching. Elevated-temperature Ar annealing following UVO exposure leads to local defect healing, as shown by the evolution of the characteristic Raman D-and G-peaks. In striking contrast, the overall graphene transistor resistance increases significantly due to void formation. Density functional calculations show that carbon-oxygen reactions lead to efficient consumption and release of C atoms (as CO or CO2) under conditions of high surface oxygen concentration.

J	Bruno, Luca; Scuderi, Mario; Priolo, Francesco; Mirabella, Salvo					Bruno, Luca/0000-0003-2710-1154			Enhanced electrocatalytic activity of low-cost NiO microflowers on graphene paper for the oxygen evolution reaction								SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS				6	19			4498	4505		10.1039/d2se00829g		SEP 2022		SEP 27 2022	2022	Electrochemical water splitting represents a promising source of renewable energy. Since electrochemistry is a useful method, it should be fast and cost-effective. However, the half-reaction for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) represents a limiting factor because of its slow kinetics and large energy barrier. Typically, although critical raw materials such as IrO2 and RuO2 can be used as catalysts, sustainable and efficient catalysts are urgently required. Among oxides of transition metals, NiO represents a promising candidate as a high-performance catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction. Here, a low-cost, high-throughput, environmentally friendly chemical methodology is used to produce NiO microflowers composed of very thin sheets (20 nm thick) intertwined like petals of a desert rose, as shown by electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. These microflowers, dispersed onto a graphene paper substrate by spin coating or drop casting, were carefully tested as electrocatalysts for the OER. The optimized electrode based on the NiO microflowers exhibited an overpotential of 314 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) under alkaline conditions (1 M KOH). The intrinsic activity of the catalyst was evaluated by measuring the Tafel plot (as low as 40 mV dec(-1)) and turnover frequencies (0.01 or 6.98 s(-1) for bulk or redox determination). The reported results prove that Ni based nanostructures are promising materials for efficient anodes in sustainable water splitting electrocatalysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2398-4902			WOS:000851219100001

The calculated results revealed that the neutral and anionic clusters were found to be more suitable catalysts than cationic clusters because of weakly bonded water oxidation reaction intermediates. In addition, the calculated structural parameters of the water oxidation intermediates with Ag2M (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) clusters revealed that M-OH bond strengths are found to be in the order of Cu < Ni < Co < Fe. Conclusively, Ag2Cu cluster was determined to be the best electro-catalyst regarding oxygen evolution reaction via 4e transfer, which is consistent with results on larger Ag2M clusters (13 atoms) and periodic Ag-M nanoalloys due to weaker binding energies of the water oxidation intermediates.

Nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) is an outstanding catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). NiOOH is composed of partially hydrogenated nickel oxide (NiO2) two-dimensional (2D) sheets that are stacked together. Owing to recent advancements in fabrication it is possible to isolate a single layer of the material. Such 2D catalytic systems are extremely promising, especially due to the wider exposed surface. However their reactivity is not completely understood, and density functional theory (DFT) is an appropriate tool to address that issue. In the current paper we use DFT to model several OER mechanisms. We show that the catalytic activity of these 2D materials is not limited to the defect sites and to the edges, as usually assumed, but rather many reaction centers are available on the NiO2 surface itself. In addition, we will provide evidence for the inhibiting effect of hydrogen ad-atoms on such layers, thus supporting the necessity of operating in highly basic conditions. The new insights that we are providing here on NiO2 reactivity, and the detailed understanding of the surface mechanisms regarding OER processes, will be key for further developments of 2D tailored catalysts. Indeed, as a main outcome of our work, NiO2 sheets are found to be significantly more reactive than bulk NiOOH itself.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			2196-0216			WOS:000419105200004

In this work, a non-noble metal-based, hierarchically porous CoO/Co@N-C microsphere electrocatalyst with low cost and earth-abundance was created by directly reducing carbonized glucose coated urchin-like Co3O4 microspheres through the carbon-thermal processing with NH3 reducing environment. Urchin-like Co3O4 microspheres provided a Co source for the creation of nano-CoO/Co active phase and served as the template without a removal requirement for the creation of hierarchically porous N-doped carbon microsphere matrix with abundant macropores and mesopores for efficient mass diffusion. Among its three major components, CoO played the leading role to provide both ORR and OER active sites, a porous N-doped carbon microsphere matrix mainly provided the conductive catalyst support, and the metallic Co component mainly acted as a "bridge" between CoO and graphic carbon to reduce the electron transfer resistance for the enhancement of its conductivity. Thus, their synergetic effect within its unique structure endowed a superior bifunctional performance toward both ORR and OER to the CoO/Co@N-C electrocatalyst over the commercially available Pt/C and Ir/C electrocatalysts.									16	2	0	0	1	0	17			2574-0962			WOS:000516665300012

Both Ta and Zr compounds film on an etched Ti rod was prepared by the reactive sputtering under various conditions which partial pressure of oxygen and nitrogen, and base material temperature were varied. The parameter of peusdo-current density which was related to the active area was defined as i*(= i.Q(A)(-1)), where QA was the anodic electric charge calculated from cyclic voltammogram, and applied for the pseudo-OER specific activity. As a result, the pseudo-OER activity of steady state (iSS.*) on Ta compounds film prepared under the optimal condition as same as that of IrO2. iSS.* of Zr compounds film prepared under optimal condition was higher than that of IrO2.					218th Meeting of the Electrochemical-Society (ECS)/Symposium of the Battery/Energy Technology Joint General Session/Symposium on Electronics and 3D Packaging 4218th Meeting of the Electrochemical-Society (ECS)/Symposium of the Battery/Energy Technology Joint General Session/Symposium on Electronics and 3D Packaging 4	OCT 10-15, 2010OCT 10-15, 2010	Electrochem Soc (ECS); Dielect Sci & TechnolElectrochem Soc (ECS); Dielect Sci & Technol	Las Vegas, NVLas Vegas, NV	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1938-5862	1938-6737	978-1-60768-249-3; 978-1-56677-897-8	WOS:000300454600018

Catalysts were characterized by XRD, SEM, XPS and BET techniques. The electrochemical activity for the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions (ORR and OER) was evaluated in alkaline media by RRDE. Density Functional Theory was used to identify two different types of active sites responsible for ORR/OER activity of CuCo2O4 and it was found that CuCo2O4 can activate the O-O bond by binding molecular oxygen in bridging positions between Co or Co and Cu atoms. It was found that the sacrificial support method (SSM) catalyst has the highest performance in both ORR and OER and has the highest content of phase-pure CuCo2O4. It was shown that the presence of CuO significantly decreases the activity in oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. The half-wave potential (E-1/2) of CuCo2O4-SSM was found as 0.8 V, making this material a state-of-the-art, unsupported oxide catalyst. (C) The Author(s) 2015. Published by ECS.

The origin of the oxygen-evolving complex								COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS				252	3-4			377	383		10.1016/j.ccr.2007.08.026				FEB 2008	2008	One of the key biochemical developments during the evolution of life was the invention of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II, responsible for catalyzing the oxidation of water to molecular oxygen in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. Though there have been a number of recent, key advances towards understanding how this remarkable chemistry is carried out, it remains a fundamental mystery how this complicated, four electron transfer process originated. Here we review some of these advances and resulting hypotheses on the origin and early evolution of the OEC. In addition, we present evidence suggesting that the four manganese-containing core of the OEC shares structural homology at the atomic level with the active sites of several distinct two manganese-containing enzymes, including manganese catalase, which carries out the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide. We discuss the implications for the plausible origin of oxygenic photosynthesis. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									54	0	1	0	31	0	56			0010-8545	1873-3840		WOS:000253178500012

Due to low active photoelectrochemical properties observed, it is assumed that the sol-gel procedure leads to hematite films with defects and surface states on which generated charge carriers are recombined or immobilized in trap processes. Electrochemical activation was proven to diminish unfavourable surface groups to some extent. More efficiently, a plasma treatment improves significantly the photoelectrochemical properties of the OER. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis reveals an oxygen enriched surface layer with new oxygen species which may be responsible for the improved electrochemical activity. Due to surface photovoltage an increased fraction of transferred charge carriers from these newly produced surface defects are identified.									29	0	0	0	2	0	29			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000313565300008	23247669

The hypochlorite oxidation takes place in two distinct steps separated with at least 200mV. While the first step can be assigned to the direct hypochlorite oxidation, the second one seems to be connected with the oxidation of strongly adsorbed in situ formed hypochlorite. In the oxidation process of hypochlorite, oxygen is the main product but also hydrogen peroxide can be detected. The number of electrons used to produce one molecule of oxygen (z) is less than expected from an electrochemical point of view. This fact, together with an accumulation of chloride ions in solution, indicates that the reaction mechanism of the hypochlorite oxidation involves the formation of radicals that can be regenerated by chemical redox reactions.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000455529800005

However, their catalytic performance needs to be further improved. Herein, a multi-pronged approach combining multi-metallic MOF5, 2D ultrathin structures and MOF hybridization was attempted. Specifically, the nanocomposite of lamellar NiFe-BTC and nanowire-like cobalt carbonate hydroxide hydrate (CCHH) was prepared on nickel foam (NF) by a two-step method. The as-prepared NiFe-BTC/CCHH/NF nanocomposite displayed excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 270 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) and good stability in 1.0 M KOH. To construct an overall water splitting electrolytic cell, the phosphorization product of CCHH/NF (P-CCHH/NF) with high catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was used as the cathode. The water splitting electrolytic cell with NiFe-BTC/CCHH/NF as anode and P-CCHH/NF as cathode was highly efficient and stable, which only needed a voltage of 1.55 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2).

Herein, a kind of carbon nanotube (CNT) supported single-site Fe-N-C catalyst was fabricated via pyrolyzing in-situ grown Fe-containing zeolitic imidazolate frameworks on CNTs. CNTs not only serve as the physical supports of the Fe-N-C active sites but also provide a conductive network to facilitate the fast electron and ion transfer. The as-synthesized catalysts exhibit a half-wave potential of 0.865 V for oxygen reduction reaction and a low overpotential of 0.442 V at 10 mA.cm(-2) for oxygen evolution, which is 310 mV smaller than that of Fe-N-C without CNTs. The rechargeable Zn-air batteries fabricated with such hybrid catalysts display a high peak power density of 182 mW.cm(-2) and an excellent cycling stability of over 1,000 h at 10 mA.cm(-2), which outperforms commercial Pt-C and most of the reported catalysts. This facile strategy of combining single-site Metal-N-C with CNTs network is effective for preparing highly active bifunctional electrocatalysts.									18	2	0	0	0	0	18			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000623104200004

However, harnessing energy is very challenging in this way due to the involvement of the 4e(-) reaction pathway, which is associated with a substantial amount of reaction barrier. After the report of the first N-doped graphene acting as an oxygen reduction reaction catalyst, the scientific community set out on exploring more reliable doping materials, better material engineering techniques, and developing computational models to explain the interfacial reactions. In this study, we modeled the graphene surface with four different nonmetal doping atoms N, B, P, and S individua II replacing a carbon atom from one of the graphitic positions. We report the mechanism of the complete catalytic cycle for each of the doped surfaces by the doping atom. The energy barriers for individual steps were explored using the biased first-principles molecular dynamics simulations to overcome the high reaction barrier. We explain the active sites and provide a comparison between the activation energy obtained by the application of two computational methods. Observing the rate-determining step, that is, oxo-oxo bond formation, S-doped graphene is the most effective. In contrast, N-doped graphene seems to be the least useful for oxygen evolution catalysis compared to the undoped graphene surface. B-doped graphene and P-doped graphene have an equivalent impact on the catalytic cycle.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2470-1343			WOS:000626269800029	33681576

Herein, nanosheets of NiFeCHH (nickel iron carbonate hydroxide hydrate) showed commanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and with the introduction of Rh3+ ions showed humongous hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1 M KOH for the first time. This new idea of introducing Rh3+ ions into NiFe systems to form trimetallic RhNiFe carbonate hydroxide systems has shown overwhelming HER response, and hence, the overall voltage for alkaline water splitting is much reduced. The overpotential required at 50 mA cm(-2) for OERs was around 207 mV for NiFeCHH (1 : 0.5) with a Tafel slope value of 30 mV dec(-1). The Rh3+-NiFeCHH (1 : 0.5) for HERs showed an overpotential of 36 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope value of 34 mV dec(-1). NiFeCHH (1 : 0.5) and Rh3+-NiFeCHH (1 : 0.5) used as the anode and cathode, respectively, showed an overpotential of 286 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) with utmost stability. This finding of adding Rh3+ ions to form RhNiFe electrodes can have huge advantage for alkaline water electrolysis with lesser energy applied.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000540915300016

Therefore, tailored electronic configurations of active centers, faster electronic conductivity associated with abundant active sites are induced as advantages to boost the relative electrocatalytic activity. Herein, we report the fabrication of Co3O4/Co(OH)2 hetero quantum dots as bifunctional electrocatalyst in rechargeable zinc air batteries (ZABs). To obtain catalytic current density of 10 mA cm-2 in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), Co3O4/Co(OH)2-HQDs only demands 300 mV overpotential, lower than Co (OH)2-QDs and Co3O4-QDs. The boosted OER performance is ascribed to the abundance of oxygen defects in Co3O4/Co(OH)2-HQDs resulting in more Co atoms in low coordination environment favorable for electroadsorption of OH- species. In addition, a robust oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activity is recorded for Co3O4/Co(OH)2-HQDs with half-wave potential of 844 mV vs. RHE. Because of the strong electronic interplay, appreciable stability is attained for Co3O4/Co(OH)2-HQDs. The manufactured aqueous rechargeable ZAB shows 1.4 times higher battery performance than Pt/C-IrO2 noble metal system. Furthermore, the all-solidstate ZAB also performs a considerable power density (57.4 mW cm-2) and its performance is well preserved during the flexibility test demonstrating the potential application in wearable devices.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000800349600003

The design of functional MOFs that can function as efficient HER and OER catalysts is significant in solving the energy crisis but remains a big challenge. Tri-metallic metal-organic frameworks show a good application prospect in water oxidation. In this review, we are going to focus on the latest progress and future trends in the development of pristine trimetallic MOFs with respect to the OER. The synergistic effect between multi-metal active sites is effective at improving the intrinsic activity of MOFs toward the OER. By summarizing the synthesis method of tri-metallic MOFs and observing their performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction, we hope that this review will trigger new developments in coordination chemistry, electrochemistry, nanomaterials and energy materials.									50	2	0	0	1	0	50			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000519117800003	32057061

State-of-the-art nanoparticulated rutile IrO2 electrocatalysts present an excellent trade-off between activity and stability due to the efficient formation of intermediate surface species. To reveal and analyze the interaction of individual surface processes, a detailed dynamic microkinetic model approach is established and validated using cyclic voltammetry. We show that the interaction of three different processes, which are the adsorption of water, one potential-driven deprotonation step, and the detachment of oxygen, limits the overall reaction turnover. During the reaction, the active IrO2 surface is covered mainly by *O, *OOH, and *OO adsorbed species with a share dependent on the applied potential and of 44, 28, and 20% at an overpotential of 350 mV, respectively. In contrast to state-of-the-art calculations of ideal catalyst surfaces, this novel model-based methodology allows for experimental identification of the microkinetics as well as thermodynamic energy values of real pristine and degraded nanopartides. We show that the loss in electrocatalytic activity during degradation is correlated to an increase in the activation energy of deprotonation processes, whereas reaction energies were marginally affected. As the effect of electrolyte-related parameters does not cause such a decrease, the model-based analysis demonstrates that material changes trigger the performance loss. These insights into the degradation of IrO2 and its effect on the surface processes provide the basis for a deeper understanding of degrading active sites for the optimization of the oxygen evolution performance.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000831252100001	35850525

Nevertheless, the mechanism of carbon dioxide reduction is still unclear and the information available is not sufficient for developing it into large scale applications, possibly because of the invariable hurdles associated with the reduction process. The reductive photocatalytic conversion of CO2 involves all the redox reactions occurring at the interface of the semiconductor such as water splitting, hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, photo-oxidation reactions and reactions of radical intermediates. The overall product yield is highly dependent on the extent of these competing reactions. Herein, we discuss our perceptions and current status of the interface reactions and their involvement in the fundamental mechanistic aspects of the photocatalytic conversion of CO2.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			0376-4710	0975-0975		WOS:000397172900001

Ru-based catalysts have high activities but always suffer from severe fading and dissolution issues, which cannot satisfy the stability demand of PEM. Herein, a series of iridium-doped yttrium ruthenates pyrochlore catalysts is developed, which exhibit better activity and much higher durability than commercial RuO2, IrO2, and most of the reported Ru or Ir-based OER electrocatalysts. Typically, the representative Y2Ru1.2Ir0.8O7 OER catalyst demands a low overpotential of 220 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), which is much lower than that of RuO2 (300 mV) and IrO2 (350 mV). In addition, the catalyst does not show obvious performance decay or structural degradation over a 2000 h stability test. EXAFS and XPS co-prove the reduced valence state of ruthenium and iridium in pyrochlore contributes to the improved activity and stability. Density functional theory reveals that the potential-determining steps barrier of OOH* formation is greatly depressed through the synergy effect of Ir and Ru sites by balancing the d band center and oxygen intermediates binding ability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000819973900001	35780475

The electrochemical characteristics of the electrodes prepared by either electrodeposition or electroless deposition were studied and compared. The change of Tafel slopes occurred as a result of the variation of coverage of nickel oxides on the surface during oxygen evolution. The coverage of the oxides as a function of potential were explored. The rate constant, k(1), for the transformation of NiOOH to NiO2 was also a function of overpotential and could be expressed as 1.651 x 10(-13) exp(0.0468 eta) mol cm(-2) s(-1) for the electrodeposited Ni as well as 2.062 x 10(-15)exp (0.0503 eta) mol cm(-2) s(-1) for the electroless Ni-P electrodes. The chemical rate constant for oxygen evolution was 1.989 x 10(-7) mol cm(-2) s(-1) for the electrode-posited Ni and 1.418 x 10(-7) mol cm(-2) s(-1) for the electroless Ni-P. The quantitative prediction of current-potential would be achieved by the kinetic model with the rate constants.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0368-1653			WOS:A1996VX65800004

In this paper, we report the synthesis of a novel all-solidstate direct Z-scheme photocatalyst of Ag3PO4/CeO2/TiO2 by depositing Ag3PO4 nanoparticles (NPs) on CeO2/TiO2 hierarchical branched nanowires (BNWs), where the CeO2/TiO2 BNWs act as a novel substrate for the well dispersed nano-size Ag3PO4. The Ag3PO4/CeO2/TiO2 photocatalyst exhibits excellent ability of photocatalytic oxygen evolution from pure water splitting. It is suggested that the Z-scheme charge transfer route between CeO2/TiO2 and Ag3PO4 improves the redox ability. On the other hand, the cascade energy level alignment in CeO2/TiO2 BNWs expedites the spatial charge separation, and hence suppresses photocatalytic backward reaction. However, it is difficult to realize a perfect excitation balance in Ag3PO4/CeO2/TiO2 and the composite still surfers photo-corrosion in photocatalysis reaction. Nevertheless, our results provide an innovative strategy of constructing a Z-scheme system from a type-II heterostructure and a highly efficient oxygen evolution catalyst. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Significant Findings: This electrocatalyst exhibited superior performance to PGM electrocatalysts in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The linear sweep voltammetry study showed that the NiFe LDH-CNT--Co3O4/NC demonstrated superior performance (Eonset = 0.85 V and E1/2 = 0.79 V for ORR; Ej=10 = 1.63 V for OER; overpotential = 0.84 V) comparing to the benchmarks of Pt/C and RuO2. A rechargeable Zn-air battery (ZAB) is used to verify the performance of the developed electrocatalyst in the ORR and OER; the ZAB exhibited an ultralow charge-discharge voltage gap (0.74 V) and excellent stability (104 cycles, > 1600 h@10 mA cm(-2)). Overall water splitting (OWS) is performed to verify the performance of the developed electrocatalyst in the OER and HER. The adopted OWS device exhibited a long and stable process (1.6 V@10 mA cm 1 , 700 h). CO2 conversion is investigated for evaluating the HER and CO2RR, and an 80% faradaic efficiency of CO production and high stability are obtained (166 mA cm-2@-1.09 V). We think that the synergistic effect of the NiFe LDHs, Co3O4 nanoparticles, and nitrogen-doped carbon electrocatalyst contributes to the excellent electrocatalytic performance of NiFe LDH-CNT--Co3O4/NC in the aforementioned reactions.

One is the expansion of the cell's spectral response, usually by the attachment of a sensitizing dye monolayer on the surface of the TiO2. The second involves the incorporation of a water oxidation catalyst that reduces the overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction. These requirements are often achieved by the co-adsorption of both the dye and the catalyst on the TiO2, or by a covalent attachment of the catalyst to the dye molecule. Here, the possibility to use a single material that acts as a sensitizer and a catalyst is presented. The use of a catechol molecule to form a type II charge transfer complex with TiO2 widens the absorption of the system into the visible region. The TiO2-catechol complex is highly catalytic toward the oxidation of water to oxygen, reducing the electrocatalytic reaction overpotential by 500 mV compared to bare TiO2. A suggested catalytic mechanism for the water oxidation reaction is described. This methodology opens a new path for type II charge transfer complexes to be utilized as catalysts/light absorbers in water splitting systems based on TiO2 or other metal oxides.									30	0	0	0	2	1	30			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000334790000014

To promote these reactions, robust and efficient catalysts are highly desired. However, developing multifunctional electrocatalysts for integrating the HER, OER and ORR into one electrode still remains a huge challenge. Constructing intriguing nanostructures with multiple components and hierarchical interfaces could be an efficient method to develop multifunctional electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a strategy, derived from ZIF-67, to synthesize a novel core-double shell heterostructure Co9S8@Co9S8@MoS2-0.5 as a trifunctional pre-catalyst for the HER, OER and ORR. Firstly, a core-shell Co@Co9S8 precursor was prepared through sulfurization and pyrolysis of ZIF-67. Then, a hydrothermal method was adopted to grow MoS2 on the Co@Co9S8 precursor. Such a synthetic strategy endows the heterostructure with a strong interface effect that affects the electronic structure of materials and further boosts their electrocatalytic performance. The obtained Co9S8@Co9S8@MoS2-0.5 heterostructure shows outstanding electrochemical performance. The overpotentials required for the HER and OER in an alkaline solution are 173 mV and 340 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, Co9S8@Co9S8@MoS2-0.5 also exhibits superior ORR performance with a half-wave potential of 0.77 V. The strategy described here can be extended to a number of integrated multifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting and metal-air batteries.									25	0	0	0	2	0	25			2052-1553			WOS:000503509100016

In this work, we have synthesized sub-10-nm Pr2Sn2O7 (PSO) and Pr2Sn2O7:Bi3+ (PSOB) nanoparticles (NPs) and investigated their optical and electrochemical properties. On ultraviolet irradiation, PSO NPs display blue emission because of the presence of oxygen vacancies. Interestingly, PSOB NPs have higher blue emission intensity than undoped PSO NPs owing to the increase in oxygen vacancy defect density induced by Bi3+ doping. Moreover, PSOB NPs display higher efficiency in terms of current density than PSO NPs as a catalyst toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The kinetic OER models of PSO and PSOB NPs are quite different as displayed by their different Tafel slopes. Interestingly and as another advantage, the PSOB sample is more conducting with low impedance value than the PSO counterpart. With all these advantages due to high oxygen vacancies induced by Bi3+ doping, PSOB NPs have a great potential to be used as blue phosphors, charge storage devices, and capacitors.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:000532291000011

Catalysts have been reported to improve the nucleation and morphology of Li2O2, which helps achieve high energy densities. We provide a new insight into the catalytic mechanism of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in aprotic Li-O-2 batteries the oxygen sites on the surface play a more important role than the exposed metal sites via a study based on the density functional theory (DFT) examining alpha-MnO2 surfaces. Lithium ions from electrolytes are found to interact with the surface oxygen sites and form surface lithium sites, facilitating further growth of Li2O2. A larger number of initial growth points with uniform distribution makes Li2O2 well dispersed, forming small particles, which benefit both the ORR and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). This design concept for oxygen sites has been successfully validated by the real Li-O-2 cell experiments with alpha-MnO2 nanowire cathodes.									44	2	0	0	5	0	45			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000354578600012

Thus, developing electrocatalysts with high performance and sufficient stability for the OER is urgently pursued. Although perovskite oxides have provided numerous degrees of freedom for enhancing the electrocatalytic activity due to their diversity and flexibility, their investigation for the OER is mostly limited to pseudocubic structures. In this study, a complex perovskite oxide, Ba0.9Sr0.1Co0.8Fe0.1Ir0.1O3-delta (BSCFI-91), with a six-layer hexagonal (6H) structure, is synthesized first, displaying higher OER activity. Based on parent Ba0.9Sr0.1Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF-91), BSCFI-91 is obtained by replacing iron (Fe) with low-level iridium (Ir) doping and produces a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 300 mV, a small Tafel slope of 61.2 mV dec(-1), and good stability up to 10 h in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. The dramatically enhanced OER performance is achieved by optimizing cobalt (Co) valence and highly oxidative oxygen species based on the hexagonal structure. The Ir incorporation facilitated the oxygen (O) p band center approaching to the Fermi level, indicating that BSCFI-91 could be a candidate in the electrocatalyst application. Moreover, this study opens up a new way to design efficient perovskite oxides for OER catalysis in terms of hexagonal crystal structures and composition modulation strategy.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2574-0962			WOS:000557375200125

The fundamental and practical implications of the relationship on any oxide surface are prerequisite to the design of new stable and active materials. Here we report an intimate relationship between the stability and reactivity of oxide catalysts in exploring the reaction on strontium ruthenate single-crystal thin films in alkaline environments. We determine that for strontium ruthenate films with the same conductance, the degree of stability, decreasing in the order (001)>(110)>(111), is inversely proportional to the activity. Both stability and reactivity are governed by the potential-induced transformation of stable Ru4+ to unstable Run>4+. This ordered(Ru4+)-to-disordered(Run>4+) transition and the development of active sites for the reaction are determined by a synergy between electronic and morphological effects.									209	3	0	0	19	0	212			2041-1723			WOS:000338838700016	24939393

Owing to the strong synergistic effect between Co3O4 and SnO(2)QDs, Co3O4/SnO(2)QD heterostructures possess more Co2+ ions for a faster Co2+/Co-0 redox reaction in the process of sensing of reducing gases and electrochemical reactions, and more oxygen vacancies for more active sites and reduced charge transfer resistance on the surface. These advantages are demonstrated to significantly enhance the gas sensitivity to xylene and greatly improve the catalysis for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As a catalyst for the OER, Co3O4/SnO(2)QD (1:1) heterostructures exhibit the highest current density, lowest onset potential, largest active surface area and remarkable durability in alkaline electrolytes. The sensitivity of Co3O4/SnO(2)QD (1:1) heterostructures to 100 ppm xylene is almost 10 times higher than that of pure Co3O4 nanosheets and 3 times higher than that of SnO(2)QDs. In addition, Co3O4/SnO(2)QD (1:1) heterostructure sensors exhibit excellent gas selectivity, long-term stability and markedly high response to low concentrations of xylene at low operating temperatures.									36	0	0	0	1	0	36			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000437761500037	29905753

In this work, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we performed a systematic theoretical study of the OER electrocatalytic activity of MoS2/g-C3N4 heterojunction. We find that the construction of heterojunction can efficiently modify the electronic properties of MoS2 phase, facilitate electron transfer, and thereby improving OER activity. In comparison to the pristine MoS2 monolayer, the theoretical overpotential of the MoS2/g-C3N4 heterojunction was significantly reduced nearly 69% from 2.52 to 0.78 V. Such outstanding OER activity mainly originates from the electronic coupling between MoS2 and g-C3N4. Overall, the present findings not only provide a vital insight into the catalytic mechanism of the enhanced OER activity of MoS2/g-C3N4 heterojunction, but also provide a new pathway to develop high-performance OER electrocatalysts for future energy conversion applications.									36	4	0	0	2	0	37			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000514902000091

Low-cost air-stable triphenylphosphine is used as phosphorus source and NaBH4 is added to facilitate the reaction, which helps to carry out the reaction at relatively low temperature (250 degrees C). By modulating the Ni/Co precursor ratios, the composition of Ni2-xCoxP NCs can be tuned over the whole range. A comprehensive study of the key role of NaBH4 on the metal phosphide NCs formation reveals that NaBH4 can efficiently activate the triphenylphosphine, lowering the thermodynamic barrier for the P-C bond broken and thus reducing the reaction temperature. As-prepared Ni2-xCoxP NCs show Ni/Co-composition dependent catalytic performance on both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In particular, OER catalytic activities follow the volcano relationship due to the synergistic effect. The Ni1.0Co1.0P NCs exhibit the highest OER catalytic activity with the overpotential of 0.34 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), among the top tier of water oxidation catalysts. In addition to providing a new green low-cost route to composition controllable synthesis of ternary phosphides, this work also contributes to fundamental guideline on rational design of low-cost high-efficient catalysts for water splitting.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			2046-2069			WOS:000393757100057

Herein, by annealing the mixture of Fe, Ni, and Mo precursors, FeNi alloys compositing with Mo2C heterophases supported on carbon layers (FeNi-Mo2C/C) were synthesized and exhibited a promising activity for oxygen evolution, with a small overpotential of 288 mV at 10 mA cm-2, which is even superior to the benchmark noble metal-based catalyst (e.g., RuO2). The introduced Mo2C heterophases reduced the particle size of FeNi alloys, increasing the amount of surface electrocatalytically active sites, and tuned the electronic structures of FeNi alloys, stimulating the surface phase transformation with highly-active metal oxides formed for the enhanced intrinsic activity of active sites. This work presents an effective and alternative approach to the modulation of electrocatalytic active sites for electrochemical energy applications.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000702577800002

The activity and durability of an electrocatalyst are generally two competing properties, which scarcely coexist. To achieve a coincidence of activity and durability, strategies of hybrid heterostructures, composition modulation, and defect engineering have been widely investigated. As a highly active but poorly durable electrocatalyst, the perovskite SrRuO3 (SRO) encounters the specified dilemma, hampering its practical application. In this work, we applied another direction of material design, which adopted as its base the wide-band-gap semiconductor perovskite SrTiO3 (STO), which is highly stable in an alkaline medium. Through doping of Ru to extent similar to 30 atom % into STO, this solid-solution electrocatalyst can exhibit better OER performance and durability in comparison to SRO. With the information from the characterization of the electronic structures and the electrochemical measurement of Ru-doped STO as direct evidence, a lattice-oxygen-mediated mechanism synergistic with small resistivity increased the OER activity. A stable STO lattice matrix can also prevent the further decomposition of the perovskite structure, substantially extending the period of operation. Our work demonstrates that, through appropriate tuning of the chemical composition in wide-band-gap semiconductor oxides, a simultaneous improvement of electrocatalytic activity and durability is achievable.									3	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000820012800001

For improving its OER performance, the present study proposed an effective method combining plasma and acid treatment to introduce oxygen-containing functional groups and produce more active sites on its surface. Compared to the pristine CC, the plasma and acid treated carbon cloth (PN-CC) delivers a reduced overpotential by 34.6% to achieve current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The Tafel slope declines from 97.5 mV dec(-1) (pristine CC) to 55.9 mV dec(-1) (PN-CC), showing an increased OER kinetic. Additionally, PN-CC electrocatalyst shows outstanding stability after 5000 cycles or 25 000 s. The combination of plasma and acid treatment shows a significant potential in surface modification for electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1009-0630	2058-6272		WOS:000610060800001

Most catalysts follow a volcano relationship of performance, making it difficult to search thoroughly enough among the huge number of possible structures to reach the volcano apex. Using first-principles simulations, we demonstrated that the design of single-atom-based catalysts (SACs) incorporating dual-active-sites breaks the universal scaling relationship between *OOH and *OH adsorption, leading to performances superior to those constrained to follow the volcano plot. Both a linear OER activity trend that reaches an ideal 0 V overpotential and a new linear scaling relation (free energy difference Delta G(OOH) = Delta G(OH) + 2.41 eV) that crosses the region of optimal limiting potentials in the volcano plot of the ORR are associated with our dual-active-site designs. This novel strategy of breaking the volcano dependence with dual-active-sites in SACs may promote the development of efficient electrocatalysts for the ORR/OER and other chemical reactions.									17	1	0	0	1	0	16			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000539350100010

The magnetite Fe3O4(001) surface, in particular, has been the focus of several studies aimed at characterizing its structure in vacuum in the presence of a water layer and interfaced with liquid water-based electrolytes. Recently, this system has also been investigated as a catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with the goal of correlating structural properties of the interface with catalytic performance and mechanism. In this work, we use first-principles simulations based on density functional theory to establish the structural, thermodynamic, and electronic properties of the Fe3O4(001) surface in contact with water. We compute the phase diagram of the magnetite/water system and address some open issues on the structural transitions observed experimentally among different surface terminations. We then address the stability in electrochemical environments, and we investigate the OER mechanism, considering reaction paths involving both terminal and bridging oxygen atoms. We find that different surface reconstructions can promote OER via different reaction sites and potential-determining steps, albeit with a similar energy cost. In particular, the bulk-truncated termination promotes OER via terminal oxygen atoms, and the potential-determining step is the dehydrogenation of the *OH group. On the (root 2 x root 2 )R45 degrees reconstruction, on the other hand, OER proceeds via the bridging oxygen atoms, and the potential-determining step is the formation of the hydroperoxo.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000693413400021

In this work, hollow chain-like nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs)/iron carbide (Fe3C) hybrid electrocatalysts (FN-B-800) is prepared by annealing of poly-vinylpyrrolidone (PVP), ferric chloride (FeCl3 center dot 6H(2)O), and melamine mixture. The resulting electrocatalysts shows very high ORR activity with the limiting current density of 5 mA cm(-2) at a speed of 1600 rpm, which is larger than that of Pt/C. Furthermore, half-wave potential (E-1/2) and onset potential of FN-B-800 are close to commercial Pt/C catalyst. Most importantly, the tolerance to fuel cell molecules (e.g., methanol) and the stability of FN-B-800 are surpasses to commercial Pt/C catalysts. Meanwhile, the FN-B-800 also exhibits an excellent OER catalytic performance. The outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic activities of the FN-B-800 hybrids are attributed to effectively doped N sites and high active Fe-N-x sites, which are synchronously constructed on carbon substrate, leading to enhancing the overall electrochemical performance.									13	1	0	0	1	0	13			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000464299500003

Inspired by this, a robust and advanced N/P co-doped carbon-based dodecahedron catalyst with confined Fe-doped Co2P particles was successfully prepared through a multi-doping engineering strategy. Phytic acid molecules, which were used in the synthesis of the catalyst, not only contribute to the formation of the porous structure, but also act as a phosphorus source to form the corresponding metal phosphide and the P dopant in the carbon matrix. Thanks to the unique composition and structure-dependent merits, the microenvironment of the electrocatalyst was significantly modulated, thus promoting the advantageous local charge rearrangement and smooth mass/charge transfer processes during the oxygen-related electrocatalytic reactions. As a result, the resultant catalyst exhibited significantly enhanced reversible oxygen activity, as evidenced by an ultra-small potential gap of 0.655 V (half-wave potential of 0.895 V for the oxygen reduction reaction; eta(10) of 320 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction), a remarkable specific capacity of 762 mA h g(Zn)(-1), and high voltaic efficiency, exceeding most previous reports. This study provides a new synthetic approach for fabricating highly efficient bi-functional oxygen catalysts and can be handily extended to the synthesis of other heterogeneous electrocatalysts for sustainable energy storage.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000861728700001

Phase transformations of metastable alpha-Co(OH)(2) into various other cobalt hydroxides, such as beta-Co(OH)(2), gamma-CoOOH, and beta-CoOOH, were selectively performed through a variation in the chemical environment, and their structures were fully characterized. In addition, electrochemical oxidative transformations of alpha-Co(OH)(2) and beta-Co(OH)(2) into gamma-CoOOH and beta-CoOOH, respectively, were successfully accomplished. The prepared cobalt hydroxides were applied to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and chloride oxidation reaction (COR) to investigate the correlation between the crystal structure and activity. The gamma-CoOOH showed better OER catalytic activity than beta-CoOOH. In contrast, beta-CoOOH showed higher COR selectivity than gamma-CoOOH. Interestingly, the faradaic efficiency of the COR was over 97% on beta-CoOOH at a concentration of 0.1 M NaCl, and this value is the highest COR faradaic efficiency compared to all other electrodes. The importance of the crystal structure for each electrocatalytic reaction is elucidated.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000797033400001

Unfortunately, large overpotential is needed to overcome the sluggish kinetics of OER. With ultra-thin thickness, large specific surface area, rich and adjustable pore structure, and well-defined metal centers, two dimensional (2D) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely investigated for OER. By virtue of the desirable chemical composition and diverse structural type, 2D MOFs are also employed as precursors and sacrificial templates to prepare metal-decorated porous carbon, metal oxides, metal hydroxides, metal sulfides, metal phosphides, and so on. These 2D MOFs derivatives with high surface area and abundant metal sites exhibit excellent OER performance. Herein, the current advances on 2D MOFs and their derivatives as (pre)electrocatalysts are summarized, including the synthetic strategy and OER performance. Moreover, the structure-performance relationships and actual active species or sites of 2D MOFs and their derivatives toward OER are discussed. The current scientific and technological challenges and future perspectives related with 2D MOF and their derivatives in practical applications are also mentioned at last.

Between the two photoelectrodes, the photoanodes for PEC water oxidation are mostly studied for the facile selection of n-type semiconductors. Initially, the efficiency of the PEC process is rather limited, which mainly results from the existing drawbacks of photoanodes such as instability and serious charge-carrier recombination. To improve PEC performances, researchers gradually focus on exploring many strategies, among which engineering photoelectrodes with suitable cocatalysts is one of the most feasible and promising methods to lower reaction obstacles and boost PEC water splitting ability. Here, the basic principles, modules of the PEC system, evaluation parameters in PEC water oxidation reactions occurring on the surface of photoanodes, and the basic functions of cocatalysts on the promotion of PEC performance are demonstrated. Then, the key progress of cocatalyst design and construction applied to photoanodes for PEC oxygen evolution is emphatically introduced and the influences of different kinds of water oxidation cocatalysts are elucidated in detail. Finally, the outlook of highly active cocatalysts for the photosynthesis process is also included.									91	6	0	0	4	0	92				2198-3844		WOS:000456385900008	30693190

Herein, we report an efficient and stable overall water splitting system; cobalt nitride-vanadium oxynitride nanohybrid, prepared from the polyaniline (PANI) mediated synthetic protocol. This nanohybrid produces significantly higher water oxidation, proton reduction as well as overall water splitting performances compared to the cobalt nitride, vanadium oxynitride or even noble metal catalyst systems. Only 263 mV overpotential is required to reach 10 mA cm(-2) current density for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 118 mV for the same in case of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Finally, the bifunctional nanohybrid has been explored for the alkaline overall water splitting at cell voltage of 1.64 V to attain 10 mA cm(-2) current density with long term stability for 100 h. Post-catalytic analyses have revealed the formation of defect rich amorphous CoOx sites leading to high OER activity, whereas crystalline Co(OH)(2)-Co delta(+)-N (0 < delta < 2) centres are generated after HER. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a nitride-oxynitride nanohybrid system employed for the overall water splitting, and its superior activity and durability recommend its potential for practical utilization.									148	10	0	0	4	0	147			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000449444000055

We show that the accumulation of microscopic oxygen bubbles in the pores of the electro-catalyst layer during the OER takes place in both RDE and MEA measurements. However, this accumulation was found to be much more significant in RDE measurements, where the shielding of almost all of the catalyst active sites by gas bubbles leads to rapid performance deterioration. This decrease in performance, albeit largely reversible, was found to also induce irreversible catalyst degradation, which could be avoided if the accumulation of microscopic bubbles is prevented. This type of artefact results in vastly under-estimated catalyst lifetimes obtained by RDE experiments, resulting in values that are orders of magnitude shorter than those obtained using MEA measurements, and a hypothesis for this discrepancy will be proposed. Therefore, electrochemical cells with liquid electrolytes are not reliable for OER catalyst lifetime determination.

Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) of the surfaces before and after cycling in alkaline electrolytes was used to understand the morphology of the impurities and their impact on the catalytic sites. The nature of the contaminant species is identified as 3d-transition metal cations, and the formation of hydr(oxy)oxides of these elements is established as the main reason for the observed behavior. We find that, while for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) the blocking of the sites by the undesired 3d-transition metal hydr(oxy)oxide species leads to deactivation of the reaction activities, the CO oxidation reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) can have beneficial effects from the same impurities, the latter being dependent on the exact nature of the adsorbing species. These results show the significance of impurities present in real electrolytes and their impact on electrocatalysis.									61	4	0	0	5	0	65			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000310121000015

The electrocatalytic activities of these catalysts were investigated by thin-film RDE technique.

Ti4+ ion was incorporated into ultrathin Fe2O3 film by solvothermally etching a hematite film fabricated on titanium nanorod, array substrate. As a consequence, the onset potential (V-on) of oxygen evolution reaction for final ultrathiri Ti-doped Fe2O3 film shifted toward cathodic substantially, a very low V-on of 0.48 V-RHE was realized, approximately' 0.53 V cathodic shift of the hematite film. Working mechanisms were investigated from both kinetic and thermodynamic ways. The ultrathin Ti-doped Fe2O3 film exhibited reduced Tafel slope and higher generated photovoltage than the pristine Fe2O3 electrode. Moreover, the highly doped Fe2O3 resulted in significant reduction of charge-transfer resistance at the Fe2O3 parallel to electrolyte interface. The drastic cathodic-shift V-on is Ibelieved to be a result of combined factors including thermodynamic contribution, improved surface reaction kinetics, as well as facilitated charge transfer across bulk and interface.									22	3	0	0	3	0	22			1944-8244			WOS:000384033600036	27557165

Transition metal phosphide and sulfide-based compounds have attracted increasing attention as active OER catalysts due to their excellent physical and chemical characters, and massive efforts have been devoted to improving the phosphide and sulfide-based materials with better activity and stability in recent years. In this review, the recent progress on phosphide and sulfide-based OER electrocatalysts in terms of chemical properties, synthetic methodologies, catalytic performances evaluation and improvement strategy is reviewed. The most accepted reaction pathways as well as the thermodynamics and electrochemistry of the OER are firstly introduced in brief, followed by a summary of the recent research and optimization strategy of phosphide and sulfide-based OER electrocatalysts. Finally, some mechanistic studies of the active phase of phosphide and sulfide-based compounds are discussed to give insight into the nature of active catalytic sites. It is expected to indicate guidance for further improving the performances of phosphide and sulfide-based OER electrocatalysts.

The electrocatalytic activity and stability of ZnSnO3 and Zn2SnO4 have been investigated for the production of O-2 gas from water. The well-defined perovskite phase of ZnSnO3 and Ruddlesden-Popper phase of Zn2SnO4 nanoparticles was synthesized via the hydrothermal route. Changing the tin precursor results in the phase transformation of the perovskite phase of ZnSnO3 into the Ruddlesden-Popper phase of Zn2SnO4 which was characterized by XRD analysis, as well as by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. It was found that the transformation of phase from perovskite to the Ruddlesden-Popper phase affects the overpotential value for zinc stannate which changes electrochemical catalytic activity resulting from the active site distribution, oxygen vacancy concentration, and electrical conductivity changes a lot. The perovskite phase of ZnSnO3 exhibits better catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with an onset potential of 430 mV than the Ruddlesden-Popper phase in an alkaline medium. Furthermore, their performance can be enhanced by changing two factor such as i) replacing A site with different transition metal (Mn, Fe, Co) cations and ii) annealing under a hydrogen atmosphere. We established a relationship for the activity of the catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction by changing zinc with other transition metal cations. This relationship exhibits trends in reactivity (Zn < Mn < Fe < Co), which is governed by the strength of the metal oxygen bond, electronegativity of metal, and the number of 'd' electrons in antibonding orbitals.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000764141100002

They represent one of the most promising future power sources. However, many barriers restrict their application on a large scale. One of the main challenges is the sluggish rates of the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen-evolution reaction (OER), which govern the discharging and charging processes of the battery, respectively. Here, recent advances related to oxygen electrocatalyst materials for ZABs are discussed. Detailed discussions will focus on unifunctional ORR electrocatalysts and bifunctional ORR and OER electrocatalysts. Pt-based nanomaterials, as the best ORR electrocatalysts, possess the virtue of high activity, but have the disadvantages of high cost, scarcity, and poor stability. Thus, materials based on transition metals (alloys, metal oxides, metal nitrides, and spinel oxides) and metal-free materials are widely investigated as nonprecious ORR catalysts owing to their promising catalytic activities. As for bifunctional ORR and OER electrocatalysts, the following two categories are introduced: (i) metal-based materials, including single metal/metal-oxides-based materials and mixed-metal/metal-oxides-based materials; and (ii) metal-free materials. Finally, perspectives on the continuous research and limitation of the current ZAB technology are provided.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2366-9608			INSPEC:17648443

It is demonstrated that the battery with the Fe2O3/XC cathode exhibits a charge voltage plateau of 4.01 V at a current density of 200 mA g(-1), which is 0.43 V lower than that with the pure XC carbon cathode. The battery also presents an outstanding rate capability, giving a charge voltage plateau of 3.99, 4.01 and 4.15 V at the current density of 100, 200 and 400 mA g(-1), respectively. Furthermore, the battery can be operated for 50 cycles at a fixed capacity of 500 mA h g(-1) without obvious degradation, showing its superior cycling stability. The results suggest that the iron oxide is a cost-effective catalyst for non-aqueous lithium-oxygen batteries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, CoFe2O4/biocarbon (CFO/BC) nanocomposites have been synthesized via a facile biosynthesis method by using yeast cells as carbon sources and structural templates. The as-prepared CFO/BC nanocomposites possess a hierarchical structure with a high surface area (79.84 m(2) g(-1)). The rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) and rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements revealed that CFO/BC nanocomposites exhibit excellent catalytic activity for both the ORR and OER. The onset potential of CFO/BC for the ORR is -0.14 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), which is higher than that of CoFe2O4 (-0.29 V) and that of biocarbon (-0.25 V), respectively. Meanwhile, the CFO/BC nanocomposites show much higher activity for the OER as compared to CoFe2O4 and biocarbon. The chronoamperometric tests show that the CFO/BC catalyst shows high durability for both the ORR and OER, outperforming the commercial Pt/C (20 wt% Pt on Vulcan XC-72, Johnson Matthey). The high electrocatalytic activity and durability of the CFO/BC nanocomposite are mainly attributed to the strong coupling between CoFe2O4 nanoparticles and biocarbon as well as the hierarchical structure of CFO/BC.									91	7	0	0	7	0	94			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000343961300039

However, constructing well-defined nanointerfaces with efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) still remains a challenge. Herein, cross columnar NiTe nanoarrays supported on nickel foam are prepared. Subsequently, NiTe/NiS nanointerfaces are constructed by an ion-exchange process. Importantly, the electrocatalytic performance for the OER can be facilitated by coupling NiTe and NiS. As a result, NiTe/NiS shows excellent OER activity with an ultralow overpotential of only 257 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2), and a Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 m KOH. The calculated and experimental results reveal that the strong electron interaction on nanointerfaces induces electronic structure modulation, which optimizes the binding energy of *OOH intermediates, thus improving the OER performance.									209	9	0	0	10	0	209			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000474801000022	30957920

It was exhibited to be a high-efficiency overall water splitting performance with good stability. The low over-potentials of 292, 330, and 376 mV were acquired when the current density was selected as 50, 100, and 200 mA/cm2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a relatively low Tafel slope. It also achieved low over-potentials of 116 and 247 mV when the current densities were 10 and 200 mA/cm2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and Tafel slope was estimated to be 95.87 mV/dec. For the overall water splitting, NF-Ni(OH)2-NivacFe-LDHs needed only a low overpotential (291 mV) to achieve 25 mA/cm2 in 1 mol/L potassium hydroxide.

In this study, the changes in the phosphorus content of droplets were measured with time using X-ray fluoroscopy technique at 1853K. Specifically, the effects of sulfur content on dephosphorization kinetics of droplets were investigated during periods of intense decarburization. The experimental results showed that the droplets with low sulfur contents (0.007wt%, 0.011wt%) exhibit a lower minimum phosphorous level and an earlier and more significant reversion compared to those with high sulfur contents. The authors suggest that dephosphorisation rate and maximum partition are favored at lower CO evolution rates as well as lower amount of CO gas generation which result in a higher interfacial oxygen potential between slag and bloated droplets. Equating the rate of CO evolution with that of FeO mass transport allowed mass transfer coefficient of FeO to be calculated, which show that FeO mass transport in dense slag is faster than it is in foaming slag.					10th International Conference on Molten Slags, Fluxes and Salts10th International Conference on Molten Slags, Fluxes and Salts	MAY 22-25, 2016MAY 22-25, 2016	Minerals Metals & Mat Soc, Extract & Proc Div; Minerals Metals & Mat Soc, Mat Proc & Mfg DivMinerals Metals & Mat Soc, Extract & Proc Div; Minerals Metals & Mat Soc, Mat Proc & Mfg Div	Seattle, WASeattle, WA	1	0	0	0	0	0	1					978-1-119-33319-7; 978-1-119-30876-8	WOS:000578029000105

Molybdenum-based materials, thanks to their metallic character induced high conductivity, have been widely studied as catalysts for a variety of reactions but few reports for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we report a dual-sites modifying strategy to modulate electrocatalytic properties of metallic MoO2 nanospheres toward OER, which is implemented by a one-pot synthesis process to prepare nickel and iron co-doped molybdenum oxide (Mo0.9Ni0.05Fe0.05O2). The introduction of dual sites (i.e., Ni and Fe) on MoO2 nanospheres surface can tune the surface electronic structure and local-chemical environment with generation of high-valence Mo and hydroxyl-rich surface, synergistically contributing to the improved electrocatalytic performance in terms of stability and activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation indicates Fe-doping site favors for enhancing the turnover efficiency (TOF) while the Ni-doping site facilitates the first proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) upon electrocatalysis of OER. The Mo0.9Ni0.05Fe0.05O2 requires only 249 mV of overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA cm-2 with excellent stability for 80 h. This study expands the research on molybdenum-based OER catalysts and gains insight into the origin of both the activity and stability of Ni/Fe-doping reactive sites.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000800002500006

Nickle-based materials have been extensively studied to catalyze OER. However, their performances are still below the expectation and the active sites are often controversial. Herein, we have successfully modulated the electronic and surface properties of layered center dot-Ni(OH)(2) by the interlayer ligand engineering, aiming to design novel efficient electrocatalysts and unveil the catalysis mechanism. By one-step solvothermal reaction, alkoxyl substituted center dot-Ni(OH)(2) with variable interlayer distances is obtained, and the ethoxyl substituted one (NiEt) shows great potential for efficient OER. With the assistance of powder X-ray diffraction and crystalline structure computational simulation, the formula of alkoxyl substituted center dot-Ni(OH)(2) are determined. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies combined withex-situanalyses revealed that the critical active species of NiEt is formedviahydroxylation and subsequent de-protonation, with high valent Ni delta+(3<delta <= 3.66). The corresponding catalytic reaction pathway and mechanism are proposed.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			1674-7291	1869-1870		WOS:000574722300002

However, the PEC performance has been severely limited by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen/hydrogen evolution reaction at the Si photoelectrode/electrolyte interface and poor stability in the aqueous environment. Herein, the bifunctional CuCo hybrid oxides (CuCo-HO) cocatalysts have been integrated with ultrathin TiO2 decorated n-type and p-type Si nanowires (NWs) to simultaneously improve the photoactivity and stability of Si photoelectrodes. The thickness of TiO2 layer, the concentration of CuCo-precursor and the hydrothermal reaction time have been investigated to optimize the PEC performance. The enhancement mechanism is studied and mainly ascribed to the increased light harvesting, small charge transfer resistance and high carrier density of Si NWs/TiO2/CuCo-HO photoelectrodes.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000441779200002	30070654

Its bottleneck reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is catalysed by hydrous iridium, a stable and active catalyst material. Improving the OER requires a better and especially quantitative understanding of the reaction mechanism as well as its kinetics. In this work, we present an experimentally validated microkinetic model that allows to quantify the mechanistic pathways, emerging surface species prior and during the OER, the reaction rates for the single steps and essential thermodynamic properties. Therefore, two mechanisms based on density functional theory and experimental findings are evaluated on which only simulation results of the theory-based one are found to be in full accordance with cyclic voltammograms even at different potential rates and, thus, able to describe the catalytic system. The simulation implies that oxygen is evolving mostly via a fast single site pathway (* OO -> *+ O-2) with an effective reaction rate, which is several orders of magnitude faster compared to the slow dual site (2* O -> 2*+ O-2) pathway rate. Intermediate states of roughly 7% Ir(III), 25% Ir(IV) and 63% Ir(V) are present at typical OER potentials of 1.6 V vs RHE. We are able to explain counterintuitive experimental findings of a reduced iridium species during highly oxidizing potentials by the kinetic limitation of water adsorption. Although water adsorption is in general thermodynamically favourable, it is kinetically proceeding slower than the electrochemical steps at high potential. In the lower potential range from 0.05 to 1.5 V vs RHE the stepwise oxidation of the iridium is accompanied with van der Waals like ad- and desorption processes, which leads in comparison to Langmuir-type adsorption to a broadened peak shape in the cyclic voltammograms. Overall, our analysis shows that the dynamic microkinetic modelling approach is a powerful tool to analyse catalytic microkinetics in depth and to bridge the gap between thermodynamic calculations and experiments.

The oxygen electrode has a substantial effect on the performance and durability of water electrolyzers and reversible (or regenerative) fuel cells because of its intrinsically slow kinetics for oxygen evolution/reduction and poor durability under harsh operating environments. To improve oxygen kinetics and durability of the electrode, extensive studies for highly active and stable oxygen electrocatalysts have been performed. However, due to the thermodynamic instability of transition metals in acidic media, noble metal compounds have been primarily utilized as electrocatalysts in water electrolyzers and reversible fuel cells. For water electrolyzer applications, single noble metal oxides such as ruthenium oxide and iridium oxide have been studied, and binary or ternary metal oxides have been developed to obtain synergistic effects of each component. On the other hand, a variety of bifunctional electrocatalysts with a combination of monofunctional electrocatalysts such as platinum for oxygen reduction and iridium oxide for oxygen evolution for reversible fuel cell applications have been mainly proposed. Practically, supported iridium oxide-on-platinum, its reverse type, and non-precious metal-supported platinum and iridium bifunctional electrocatalysts have been developed. Recent theoretical calculations and experimental studies in terms of water electrolysis and fuel cell technology suggest the effective ways to cope with current major challenges of cost and durability of oxygen electrocatalysts for technical applications.									418	21	0	0	25	2	428			1754-5692			WOS:000310006200014

The ratios between different classes of phenolic compounds also determine the colour and phenolic development of red wines. The present study evaluated the impact of forced oxidation on different anthocyanin/tannin (A/T) extracts and its consequent effect on the colour and phenolic evolution over time. The results showed that higher contents of seed tannins could enhance phenolic polymer formation, especially in the presence of oxygen. The addition of oxygen seemed to favour certain polymerisation reactions between tannins, leading to higher concentrations of monomeric anthocyanins in solution. A slower oxygen consumption was also observed as the phenolic composition of the wine-like extract evolved over time.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0253-939X	2224-7904		WOS:000482790400013

Several 2D materials have recently been proposed as effective catalysts or co-catalysts, and among them, oxygen-terminated MXenes deserve significant attention for both electro- and photo-induced water splitting. In this work, we described a hybrid photo-electrochemical approach based on the coupling of Ti3C2Tx MXene flakes on a plasmon-supported Au grating and light triggering of the electrocatalytic activity of the generated hybrid structure in a water splitting half reaction, namely, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In particular, MXene flakes with both fluor and oxygen surface terminations were deposited on a periodic patterned gold surface that was capable of supporting surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) excitation under visible and near-infrared (NIR) light illumination. SPP excitation allows sub-diffraction focusing of light energy and effective enhancement of the electrocatalytic performance of Ti3C2Tx flakes. Under illumination, a significant enhancement of the HER kinetics was observed, as well as tuning of the HER rate-determining step from the Volmer step to the Heyrovsky step. In turn, we observed several-fold enhanced hydrogen evolution, which was attributed to plasmon-assisted hot charge carrier injection, with an additional contribution from the plasmon heating effect. The proposed Au grating/Ti3C2Tx hybrid structure allows utilization of the NIR part of the solar spectrum, which is commonly not used in water photolysis but achieves better efficiency in renewable energy-assisted green hydrogen production.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000683445900001

To explore the synergetic roles of allotropic substances, carbon-rich C3N4 (CCN) is insitu hydrothermally synthesized with the N-doped graphene (NG) grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) as the template to prepare the N-doped graphene/carbon-rich C3N4 composite. Compared to the N-doped graphene and carbon-rich C3N4, N-doped graphene/carbon-rich C3N4 composite exhibits the remarkable enhancement of catalytic activities toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Particularly, visible light irradiation can significantly improve the catalytic performance of N-doped graphene/carbon-rich C3N4 toward the above three reactions. Further results confirm that N-doped graphene/carbon-rich C3N4 exhibits the improved electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), light-harvesting ability, effective separation of electron-hole pairs, and interfacial charge transfer as compared to the N-doped graphene and carbon-rich C3N4 which should be originated from the efficient bridging between N-doped graphene and carbon-rich C3N4 layers. Our elucidation facilitates to pave their promising applications in microelectronic devices, wearable devices, photoelectrochemical batteries, sensors and other fields. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A variation in the cobalt ferrite structure CoFe2-xZrxO4 with Zr (0.1-0.4) substitution has significantly altered the overpotential for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), leading to an optimum composition of CFZr(0.3). The incorporation of the foreign Zr4+ ion in the cobalt ferrite spine] lattices has effectively enhanced the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in comparison to the parent cobalt ferrite (CF) nanocrystals. However, a nominal change in the ORR current density has been observed due to Zr incorporation,. For the OER, the Zr-substituted catalyst has shown a 40 mV negative shift in the overpotential in comparison with the CF nanoparticles at 10 mA/cm(2) current density. Interestingly, the in situ grafting of Zr-substituted cobalt ferrite nanoparticles over N-doped reduced graphene oxide (CFZr(0.3)/N-rGO) results in remarkably enhanced performance during the ORR and moderately favored the OER with an overall potential difference (Delta E) of 0.840 V. The enhanced bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of the material is crucial for the fabrication of high-performance rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs). The prepared catalyst exhibited an overpotential of 80 mV for the ORR in comparison with the state-of-the-art (Pt/C) catalyst and an overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA/cm2 current density for the OER from the standard value (1.23 V vs RHE). This potential bifunctional electrocatalyst has been employed as an electrode material for the fabrication of a primary ZAB, where it exhibited discharge capacities of 727 and 730 mAh/g at current densities of 20 and 30 mA/cm(2), respectively, under ambient conditions. The notable performance of the catalyst as a bifunctional material is observed during the cycling of the rechargeable ZAB. The prepared catalyst showed an increase of 200 mV in the overall operating overpotential after cycling for 10 cycles at 15 mA/cm(2) in comparison to the 350 mV increase shown by the Pt/C catalyst.									50	3	0	0	3	0	52			2155-5435			WOS:000430154100114

Replacement of the hydrogen-evolution reaction by the oxygen-reduction reaction can reduce the overpotential of the cathodic process, depolarizing the overall reaction and saving energy. Here, we describe a series of experiments to determine the cell voltage and energy savings when a copper-doped carbon/polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) oxygen-diffusion cathode is used in brine electrolysis experiments, instead of a hydrogen-evolving graphite cathode. Voltammetric studies were carried out to determine the ideal oxygen flow rate through the porous cathode structure and the amount of copper that maximizes oxygen-reduction current densities. Brine electrolysis was performed in a two-compartment membrane cell using a TiO2/RuO2 anode. Our findings indicate a strong depolarizing effect with the copper-doped oxygen-diffusion cathode. Comparison of the results using a graphite (hydrogen-evolving) cathode and a copper-doped cathode at 70 degrees C showed that the latter resulted in 42% reduction in energy demand.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0888-5885			WOS:000318204900013

Excellent features including the Co/N-doping effect, introduction of CoO@Co particles with a core-shell structure and good contact between the CoO@Co particles and N-doped graphene result in a highly multi-functional catalytic efficiency. The catalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic activity and superior stability towards the hydrogen evolution reaction, offering a low overpotential of 140 mV for 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 237 mV in 0.1 M KOH. The catalyst also shows excellent oxygen reduction reaction activity in 0.1 M KOH, a similar four-electron pathway, which is comparable to that of a commercial Pt/C catalyst, and superior stability.

Herein, 'Nanoplatelet-on-Nanoarray' NiCo hydroxide-based electrocatalysts (t-NiCo-MOF) fabricated from the facile transformation of bimetallic metal-organic framework nanoarrays is reported to exhibit rich surface active sites and unprecedented activity towards the oxidation of organic molecules including 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, urea, methanol and glycerol. Benefitting from the synergy between Ni/Co and unique nanostructure which facilitates the charge and mass transfer, the optimal electrode exhibits current densities of 600 similar to 730 mA/cm(2) at 1.4 V vs RHE and the Tafel slopes are in the range of 35 similar to 58 mV/dec depending on the oxidized species. Value-added chemicals such as 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid and formate are produced from HMF and methanol/glycerol (main constituents of 'bio-glycerol') with high FE and superior stability, demonstrating its promises in high-throughput electrochemical biomass upgrading.									48	0	0	0	2	0	48			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000564570600003

However, hindered by low electrical conductivity and limited electrocatalytic active sites, bare NiO usually exhibits poor electrochemical performance towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we develop an N(2)plasma activation approach to simultaneously improve both HER and OER activity of NiO by constructing heterostructured Ni/Ni3N/NiO nanosheet arrays on Ni foam. The optimized N(2)plasma-activated NiO nanosheet arrays for HER and OER (denoted as P-NiO-HER and P-NiO-OER) only need an overpotential of 46 and 294 mV, respectively, to achieve 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, for overall water splitting, the assembled electrolysis cell with P-NiO-HER and P-NiO-OER as the cathode and anode, respectively, only requires a small voltage of 1.57 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2). Remarkably, the plasma-activated NiO nanosheet arrays exhibit excellent stability for up to 50 h for HER, OER, and full water electrolysis. The strategy developed here to activate the electrocatalytic performance of metal oxides opens a new door for water splitting.									8	1	0	0	1	0	9			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000563366500001	32707567

Recent studies on metal phosphates have revealed their potential as another class of oxygen electrocatalysts. Among the metal phosphates Co-3(PO4)(2) has demonstrated fairly good activity for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the performance of native Co-3(PO4)(2) as a bifunctional oxygen catalyst is inferior to that of the noble metal catalysts. In this study we found out that the inadequacy of Co-3(PO4)(2) could be ameliorated by integrating it with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanosheets. The oxygen bifunctionality as measured by the potential difference (Delta E) between OER and ORR in alkaline solution can be lowered to 0.86 V for an optimized catalyst, which even surpasses the performance of a 20 wt Ir/C benchmark catalyst (0.93 V); making it one of the best non-noble metal oxygen electrocatalysts. The good bifunctional performance may be attributed to the strong coupling between the Co-3(PO4)(2) submicroparticles and the RGO nanosheets which synergizes the oxygen activity of Co-3(PO4)(2) with the (electron) transport properties of RGO. The experimental results also suggest that Co-3(PO4)(2) is more active than the popular CoOx. catalysts since the performance degradation in OER and ORR was found to correlate positively with the in-situ transformation of surface Co-3(PO4)(2) to CoOx.

Benefiting from the structural and catalytic advantages of amorphous Ni3S2 and defect-rich NiFe materials, as well as the strong electronic interaction at the heterogeneous interface, the NiFe/Ni3S2/NF catalytic electrode exhibited excellent oxygen evolution performance: only an overpotential of 273 mV was needed to attain a current density of 100 mA.cm(-2), which is far superior to most of the reported Ni/Fe-based composite materials. It can stably output a high current density of 1000 mA.cm(-2) at the overpotential of 372 mV for more than 27 h in 1 mol.L-1 KOH solution.									3	2	0	0	0	0	4			1001-4861			WOS:000627578500014

The La2O2CO3 nanorods are well distributed on the regular hexagonal La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 nanosheet. The La2O2CO3-La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 catalyst has better catalytic activity to oxygen reduction reaction than that of La2O2CO3 or La0.7Sr0.3MnO3. The reaction kinetics result shows that La2O2CO3-La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 sample follows a four-electron transferred process during the oxygen reduction reaction. Furthermore, the stability of La2O2CO3-La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 is higher than that of Pt/C. By using La2O2CO3-La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 as the cathode catalysts for aluminumair battery, the power densities can reach 223.8 mW cm(2). The high catalytic performance of the La2O2CO3-La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 can be attributed to the strong interaction between the La2O2CO3 material and La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 material.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12				2574-0970		WOS:000461401300034

Numerous methods have been established to increase the activity of electrocatalysts, including increasing active surface area and improving intrinsic catalytic activity. However, the electrochemical water splitting is a gas-involving reaction in which hydrogen and oxygen bubbles are formed on cathode and anode surfaces, respectively, which lead to an increase in overpotential of electrochemical reactions. In this review, recent advances have been complied to understand the behavior of hydrogen and oxygen bubbles separation from the surface of electrodes during water splitting. Initially, various types of resistance in water splitting have been discussed, and further progress has been discussed to improve the separation of bubbles and thus improve electrocatalytic activity. These improvements include surface nanostructuring and making superaerophobic surfaces where bubbles can easily be removed from the surface, resulting in lower bubble resistance. Furthermore, the use of magnetic, supergravity and ultrasonic fields are among additional methods for fast separation of bubbles from the surface and improving catalytic activity This paper presents a review of a research pathway for creating 3D nanoarrays to improve the bubble separation behavior on the surface and improve electrocatalytic properties.									91	3	0	0	3	0	91			1364-0321	1879-0690		WOS:000488871200039

Herein, for the first time, we report a hierarchical bifunctional CuSn alloy electrocatalyst for efficient production of a single formate via simultaneous cathodic CO2RR and anodic methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), achieving a record-high formate production rate of 3313 mu mol h(-1) cm(-2), with nearly 100% formate selectivity. Moreover, coupling CO2RR with MOR requires an electricity input of only 2.61 kWh kg(formate)(-1) , in contrast to the 4.46 kWh kg(formate)(-1)required for CO2RR coupled with conventional oxygen evolution reaction. DFT calculation results reveal that the calculated limiting potential for formate production is lower than those for CO and H-2 production on CuSn alloy, leading to the high selectivity for formate production.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000799216300004

In this work, we introduce an alcohothermal synthesis method for fabricating NiFe-LDHs with dehydrated galleries. The proposed process involves incomplete hydrolysis of urea for the simultaneous precipitation of metal ions, with the resulting water-deficient ethanol environment leading to the formation of a dehydrated structure. The formation of a gallery-dehydrated layer structure was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), as well as by a subsequent rehydration process. The methodology introduced here is also applicable for fabricating Fe-based LDHs (NiFe-LDH and NiCoFe-LDH) nanoarrays, which cannot be produced under the same conditions in aqueous media because of the different precipitation processes involved. The LDH nanoarrays exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance in the oxygen evolution reaction, as a result of their high intrinsic activity and unique structural features. In summary, this study not only introduces a new method for synthesizing LDH materials, but also provides a new route towards highly active and robust electrodes for electrocatalysis.									25	2	0	0	1	0	26			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000385194100028

Cationic Ni has been widely established as an active site in nickel sulfide due to the relatively low Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (Delta G(H*)). However, one of the big unsettled issues is whether S can be activated as a more active site than Ni in NiS2. Herein, the swapping of catalytic active sites from cationic Ni to anionic S in a hierarchical structure consisting of NiS2 nanoflowers grown on dual-phased NiS2-NiS foam (denoted as NiS2/NiS2-NiS) is shown. A combined study of theoretical calculations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis demonstrate the remarkably antidromic electron transfer from Ni to S sites, therefore relieving the adsorption of hydrogen species and endowing a higher intrinsic activity at the S site over the Ni site. The new catalyst therefore exhibits superior HER performance, identified by doubling in the intrinsic activity and a twofold increased turnover frequency value compared to its pure NiS2 counterpart (0.028 s(-1) vs 0.015 s(-1) at the applied overpotential of 200 mV). The NiS2/NiS2-NiS electrode also demonstrates outstanding activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction and overall water splitting.									23	0	0	0	2	0	23			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000740626300001

The origin of the incorporated oxygen and its incorporation mechanism into MoS2 were carefully investigated. We found that the solvent N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) was the key as the reducing agent and the oxygen donor, expanding interlayer spaces and improving intrinsic conductivity of MoS2 sheets (modulating its electronic structure and vertical edge sites). These O dopants, vertically aligned edges and decoration with rGO gave effectively improved double-layer capacitance and catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of MoS2. The prepared O-MoS2/rGO catalysts showed an exceptional small Tafel slope of 40 mV/decade, a high current density of 20 mA/cm(2) at the overpotential of 200 mV and remarkable stability even after 2000th continuous HER test in the acid media.									86	0	0	0	6	0	87			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000384518500030	27599679

Delithiated Li1-xNiO2 was thermally decomposed to LiNi2O4 spinel (Fd3m) at the temperature range of 180-250 degreesC. For x less than or equal to 0.5, Li1-xNiO2 was decomposed to LiNiO2 and LiNi2O4 and the fraction of the spinel in the decomposed product increased almost linearly with x. For 0.5 < x less than or equal to 0.8, Li1-xNiO2 was converted into LiNi2O4 spinel and this reaction was accompanied by oxygen evolution. Li1-xNiO2 of all compositions turned into a rock-salt phase (Fm3m) with oxygen liberation at temperatures above 270 degreesC. The temperature for the decomposition of Li1-xNiO2 to a spinel or a rock-salt phase decreased with x in Li1-xNiO2. The thermal behavior of Li1-xNiO2 could be interpreted as an overlap of the exothermic rearrangement of cations (nickel and lithium ions) to form a spinel or a rock-salt phase and the endothermic oxygen evolution reaction.

Here we report on the structurally reversible evolution of crystalline Co3O4 electrocatalysts during oxygen evolution reaction identified using advanced in situ X-ray techniques. At electrode potentials facilitating oxygen evolution, a sub-nanometre shell of the Co3O4 is transformed into an X-ray amorphous CoOx(OH)(y) which comprises di-mu-oxo-bridged Co3+/4+ ions. Unlike irreversible amorphizations, here, the formation of the catalytically-active layer is reversed by re-crystallization upon return to non-catalytic electrode conditions. The Co3O4 material thus combines the stability advantages of a controlled, stable crystalline material with high catalytic activity, thanks to the structural flexibility of its active amorphous oxides. We propose that crystalline oxides may be tailored for generating reactive amorphous surface layers at catalytic potentials, just to return to their stable crystalline state under rest conditions.									540	12	0	0	45	0	540			2041-1723			WOS:000364934200027	26456525

Herein, a series of lanthanum cobaltate based perovskites are synthesised with the B-site cation deficiencies in the structure occupied by Ru substitution: LaCo1-xRuxO3-delta(x= 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.5). These compositions were designed to enhance the OER/ORR activities, which are two vital reactions for rechargeable Zn-air batteries. Powder X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that increasing the Ru substitution >20% (x> 0.2) alters the LaCoO(3)crystal structure from rhombohedral to orthorhombic. Photoelectron spectroscopy studies reveal that the surface oxygen vacancies increased in the Ru substituted catalyst, a property important for enhancing the OER/ORR efficiency. The LaCo0.8Ru0.2O3-delta(LCRO82) catalyst exhibits promising electrocatalytic activities in both the OER and the ORR in 0.1 M KOH solution. Furthermore, the LCRO82 catalyst was evaluated as a cathode for rechargeable Zn-air battery applications displaying a high power density of 136 mW cm(-2)at a current density of 175 mA cm(-2)and a stable charge-discharge voltage gap of 0.78 V after 1440 cycles, with excellent cycling stability over 240 h.									12	1	0	0	0	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000578872600033

Both experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that Co-N-C cooperates with its neighboring oxygen vacancy to effectively modulate the charge density of oxygen-vacant Co active site, thus optimizing its adsorption energies and in turn remarkably enhancing intrinsic ORR/OER activities. The optimized catalyst exhibits remarkably reduced overpotential for ORR/OER, and exhibits an ultra-high specific capacity and energy density for a rechargeable zinc-air battery, as well as a long-term cycling stability.									63	5	0	0	0	0	63			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000564577900004

The rational design and in situ synthesis of hierarchical porous nanocomposite sheets of nitrogen-doped graphene oxide (NGO) and nickel sulfide (Ni7S6) derived from a hybrid of a well-known nickel-based metal-organic framework (NiMOF-74) using thiourea as a sulfur source are reported here. The nanoporous NGO/MOF composite is prepared through a solvothermal process in which Ni(II) metal centers of the MOF structure are chelated with nitrogen and oxygen functional groups of NGO. NGO/Ni7S6 exhibits bifunctional activity, capable of catalyzing both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with excellent stability in alkaline electrolytes, due to its high surface area, high pore volume, and tailored reaction interface enabling the availability of active nickel sites, mass transport, and gas release. Depending on the nitrogen doping level, the properties of graphene oxide can be tuned toward, e.g., enhanced stability of the composite compared to commonly used RuO2 under OER conditions. Hence, this work opens the door for the development of effective OER/HER electrocatalysts based on hierarchical porous graphene oxide composites with metal chalcogenides, which may replace expensive commercial catalysts such as RuO2 and IrO2.									171	3	0	0	3	0	172			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000409117500002

CoP and its compounds have been widely reported using in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, few reports about CoP as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were presented. In this work, we prepare reduced graphene-oxide(rGO)-loaded CoP (rGO@CoP) as an electrocatalyst for ORR through in situ hydrothermal treatment. The rGO@CoP as ORR catalyst exhibits excellent activities where its onset potential has a positive increase of 129 mV, and the ORR potential achieves an increase of 330mV at a current density of 1.0 mAcm(-2) compared with that of pure CoP. The current density is also significantly improved with an increase of 0.51 mAcm(-2) at -350 mV, and the Tafel slope has a decrease of 19 mV dec(-1). Further tests show that the electron transfer number of rGO@CoP is 3.66, which is larger than 2.19 of pure CoP, indicating that it is dominated by a four-electron transfer pathway. Moreover, its stability (remained 98.6% current after working 6000 s) and methanol tolerance are outstanding. These results show that rGO@CoP may be considered to replace traditional Pt-based ORR catalysts for fuel cells, and rGO loading has been proven to be an effective strategy to enhance the ORR performance of CoP, which may provide a new idea to synthesize transition metal phosphides as ORR catalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1793-2920	1793-7094		WOS:000433554700002		
J	MISHRA, SR; SABAT, SC								CHARACTERIZATION OF RUTHENIUM CHLORIDE SUPPORTED HILL REACTION IN BEET SPINACH THYLAKOIDS								PHOTOSYNTHETICA				31	1			77	84						1995	1995	The photosynthetic electron transport activities in beet spinach thylakoids were studied using ruthenium chloride as an electron acceptor. Like potassium ferricyanide, RuCl3 supported the non-cyclic electron flow with net evolution of oxygen. The rate of oxygen evolution was at its maximum with 0.5 mM RuCl3 at pH of 8.0 and the electron flow coupled to translocation of protons into the thylakoid vesicles. Ruthenium chloride-supported oxygen evolution was inhibited by specific photosynthetic electron tt ansport inhibitors like diuron, dibromothymoquinone, potassium cyanide, and mercuric chloride. Unlike ferricyanide, the RuCl3-supported oxygen evolution was totally inhibited by potassium cyanide and mercuric chloride at both pH 8.0 and 6.5. Since potassium cyanide and mercuric chloride mostly interrupt the electron flow at plastocyanin level, RuCl3 probably accepts electrons mostly from photosystem 1 or its near vicinity. Besides electron acceptance, RuCl3 suppresses the photophosphorylation activity in a manner similar to energy transfer inhibitors.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0300-3604			WOS:A1995QU98700009

Water splitting is an effective method for high purity hydrogen production; however, it requires efficient, low-cost and durable catalysts. Herein, a facile method to synthesize self-assembled 3D laminar NiCo2Px anchored on functionalized carbon nanotubes (NiCo2Px/CNTs) is developed for achieving cost-efficient, highly-active, and robust electrocatalysts towards overall water splitting in 1M KOH. Notably, the overpotentials at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) are as low as 47 and 284 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. The water electrolyzer device using NiCo2Px/CNTs as both the cathode and anode only requires a cell voltage of 1.61 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm (2) along with outstanding durability for at least 48 h. Furthermore, the catalytic mechanism was discussed with a special emphasis on the synergetic effect of Ni and Co and real OER active species. Our work not only establishes a promising electrocatalyst, but also provides a general strategy to enhance the activity and stability of metal phosphides.									256	11	0	0	7	0	256			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000431621700014

In this study, the manganese dioxide nanoflowers onto sulfonated graphene sheets (denoted as delta-MnO2/SGS) is synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method for bifunctional electrocatalytic application in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The formation of delta-MnO2 nanoflowers onto SGS plays a crucial role in intrinsic catalytic activity, resulting in an impressive enhancement in both ORR and HER in alkaline electrolyte. The morphological features and X-ray analysis are shown the successful sulfonation and the Mn presents in oxide form with delta-type crystallographic structure. The growth reaction mechanism of delta-MnO2 nanoflowers is proposed in alkaline media. The robust electrocatalysis is inherited from the cave among crystalline lego-block-like petals at microscale level and the large interlayer spacing at nanoscale level of delta-MnO2 nanoflowers with significant electrical conductivity. The delta-MnO2/SGS catalyst exhibits nearly same ORR and HER activity in terms of current density with electron transfer and final current density with Tafel slope, respectively, compare to the benchmark Pt/C.

The electrochemical performance of these fibers for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions was characterized in a KOH solution. Additionally, the electrochemical properties were compared with those of a conventional PtRu/C catalyst and a LaCoO3 powder, which was synthesized using the Pechini method. The LaCoO3 fibers had a greater surface area compared with the powder, whereas the crystal structures of the fibers and powder were notably similar. The LaCoO3 fibers demonstrated better electrochemical properties compared with the LaCoO3 powder, which was attributed to the increased surface area and number of active sites in the fibers.									23	2	0	0	0	0	24			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000359453900008

This work presents the in situ preparation of holey NiFe-LDH nanosheets on Ni foam (H-NiFe-LDH/NF) via a one-step hydrothermal method in the presence of PEO-PPO-PEO as the soft template. The holey NiFe-LDH nanosheets provide a high electrochemical surface area, more edge catalytic sites, and abundant oxygen vacancies. Consequently, HNiFe-LDH/NF exhibits excellent catalytic activity to oxygen evolution, urea oxidation, and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER, UOR, and HER) with good stability in alkaline electrolytes. This electrode requires an overpotential of 261 mV for the OER, a potential of 1.480 V for the UOR to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm-2 in alkaline solutions. By employing the self-supported electrode as both the anode and cathode, this electrolysis cell (H-NiFe-LDH/NF||H-NiFe-LDH/NF) gains current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm-2 at low cell voltages of 1.575 and 1.933 V in the 1.0 M KOH solution. After adding 0.33 M urea, the voltages to deliver 10 and 100 mA cm-2 respectively decrease to 1.418 and 1.691 V. The HNiFe-LDH/NF electrode also shows excellent stability for water-splitting and urea electrolysis. This work not only contributes to developing a low-cost, high-efficiency, bifunctional electrocatalyst but also provides a practically feasible approach for urea-rich wastewater electrolysis.

Well-aligned IrO2 nanotube arrays with high purity and uniform size are produced by using this synthetic strategy. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are employed to examine the morphology, fine structure and composition of the IrO2 nanotube arrays intensively. Furthermore, electrocatalytic water oxidization experiments are performed to assess the catalytic performance of the as-prepared IrO2 nanotube arrays toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The IrO2 nanotube arrays have been found to possess an excellent catalytic performance: high turnover frequency (3.3 s(-1) for TOF at 1.2 V versus Ag/AgCl), low oxygen evolution overpotential (eta = 0.15 V) and good catalytic stability (55% catalytic activity remaining after undergoing 400 times potential cycles).

The essential ingredients of this approach consists of (1) co-electrodeposition of Ru, Ti, and Zn as a metallic alloy and then annealing it to form an oxide, (2) dissolution under electrochemical oxidative acidic environment of Ru and Zn-rich surface clusters having a high selectivity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) affording the Ti-enriched structure that is more selective to chlorine evolution reaction (CER), and (3) using this electrocatalyst for KClO3 production under near-neutral pH conditions. The dissolution of Ru- and Zn-enriched surfaces resulted in a porous structure with a higher electrochemical surface area and roughness. Furthermore, this electrochemical dissolution of the (Zn, Ru)-rich surface results in an electrocatalytic structure that is self-selective towards the KClO3 formation with a higher specific activity. The co-electrodeposition of Zn aids (1) the formation of the roughened and porous surface structure through surface dissolution of Zn-or ZnO-clusters and (2) the enhancement of conductivity of the electrocatalyst through the formation of oxygen vacancies. The obtained structure exhibited a higher specific activity and stability towards the KClO3 production in comparison to the untreated (Zn, Ru)-doped TiO2 or Ru-doped TiO2 or RuO2.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000424108400021

Herein, FeS2/CoS2 interface nanosheets (NSs) as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting are reported. The thickness and interface disordered structure with rich defects of FeS2/CoS2 NSs are confirmed by atomic force microscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy clarifies that FeS2/CoS2 NSs with sulfur vacancies, which can further increase electrocatalytic performance. Benefiting from the interface nanosheets' structure with abundant defects, the FeS2/CoS2 NSs show remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with a low overpotential of 78.2 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a superior stability for 80 h in 1.0 m KOH, and an overpotential of 302 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). More importantly, the FeS2/CoS2 NSs display excellent performance for overall water splitting with a voltage of 1.47 V to achieve current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and maintain the activity for at least 21 h.

Energy Environ. Sci. 2018, 11, 1762-1769]. Herein, we provide a generalized framework behind the concept of subsurface alloying with different transition-metal dopants, host metal oxides, and doping levels. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations and detailed electronic-structure analysis, we first identify the electronic structure origin of the activation and stabilization phenomena and propose a tuning mechanism that enables the identification of candidate subsurface dopants in STO, with the highest activity for both oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. We then show that the proposed mechanism is applicable to subsurface alloys formed with other host materials such as SrZrO3, TiO2, and ZrO2. Finally, we propose a materials design scheme using partial subsurface alloying for more precise tuning of surface reactivity and activity. By generalizing the concept of subsurface alloying of metal oxides, our work explains why the SRO subsurface alloyed STO has among the highest OER enhancements and importantly provides a new route in tailoring the activity and stability of earth-abundant electrocatalysts for water splitting.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000551412800017

La-based perovskites of 3d-transition metals have demonstrated excellent activities as electrocatalysts in water oxidation. Herein, we report the synthesis route to La-based perovskites using an environmentally friendly deep eutectic solvent (DES) consisting of choline chloride and malonic acid. The DES route affords phase-pure crystalline materials on a gram scale and results in perovskites with high electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction. A convenient, fast, and scalable synthesis proceeds via assisted metathesis at a lower temperature as compared to traditional solid-state methods. Among LaCoO3, LaMn0.5Ni0.5O3, and LaMnO3 perovskites prepared via the DES route, LaCoO3 was established to be the best-performing electrocatalyst for water oxidation in alkaline medium at 0.25 mg cm(-2) mass loading. LaCoO3 exhibits current densities of 10, 50, and 100 mA cm(-2) at respective overpotentials of approximately 390, 430, and 470 mV, respectively, and features a Tafel slope of 55.8 mV dec(-1). The high activity of LaCoO3 as compared to the other prepared perovskites is attributed to the high concentration of oxygen vacancies in the LaCoO3 lattice, as observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. An intrinsically high concentration of O vacancies in the LaCoO3 synthesized via the DES route is ascribed to the reducing atmosphere attained upon thermal decomposition of the DES components. These findings will contribute to the preparation of highly active perovskites for various energy applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000821777200051	35545871	
J	Zhang, Zhenbao; Chen, Yubo; Dai, Ziyang; Tan, Shaozao; Chen, Dengjie				Chen, Yubo/ABD-9273-2021	Chen, Yubo/0000-0002-8252-0856			Promoting hydrogen-evolution activity and stability of perovskite oxides via effectively lattice doping of molybdenum								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				312				128	136		10.1016/j.electacta.2019.04.163				JUL 20 2019	2019	Electrocatalysts are the most compelling objectives in realizing highly efficient renewable energy conversion and storage applications. Rational doping is an effective strategy for the development of cost-effective perovskite oxides with high electrochemical performance. In this study, we report facilely prepared molybdenum (Mo)-doped SrCo0.70Fe0.30O3-delta perovskites such as SrCo0.7Fe0.25Mo0.05O3-delta (SCFM0.05) and SrCo0.7Fe0.20Mo0.10O3-delta (SCFM0.10) for boosting the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and stability. Among them, SCFM0.05 delivers a promising overpotential of similar to 323 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(disk)(-2) and keeps almost stable for 5 h and after accelerated 1000 cycles. The promoted HER activity of SCFM0.05 regarding the decreased overpotential, increased catalytic current density, and improved charge transfer kinetics, might originate from the combined effects of distortion of octahedral coordination, low oxygen vacancy/high oxidation state of Co, abundant lattice oxygen and highly oxidative oxygen species, long B-O length, and strong OH- adsorption compared to the un-doped counterpart. We ascribe the enhanced operational stability to the formation of a low concentration of oxygen vacancy that stabilizes the crystal structure of Mo-doped SrCo0.7Fe0.3O3-delta and prevents the surface from Sr leaching/surface amorphization. These findings suggest that tuning perovskite oxide using a redox-inactive dopant featured with high valence state may provide further avenues to HER optimization. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The oxidation occurs according to the high-field law with high-field parameters log(i(0)/A cm(-2)) =-13.4 +/- 1 and beta=10.6 +/- 0.1 nin V-1. The oxide films represent an almost ideal dielectric material with epsilon = 6.5. Oxide growth is not affected by oxygen evolution, which starts at potentials > 3 V. The electron transfer process was analysed in relation to the oxygen evolution reaction. Owing to the presence of oxide thicknesses higher than 2 nin at this point, direct tunneling is less probable and a tunneling via traps should be assumed for the charge transfer. Evidence for coupled electronic and ionic conduction is presented. A contribution of the valence band in SiO2 is stated for the corrosion of oxides at potentials > 4.5 V.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1432-8488			WOS:000179507700002

Here, we present a facile preparation of Mo-P dual-doped Co/oxygen-deficient Co3O4 core-shell nanorods as a highly efficient electrocatalyst. In this strategy, oxygen vacancies are first generated in Co3O4 nanorods by lithium reduction at room temperature, which endows the materials with bifunctional characteristics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A Co layer doped with Mo and P is further deposited on the surface of the Co3O4-x nanorods to enhance the electrocatalytic hydrolysis performance. As a result, the overpotentials of HER and OER are only 281 and 418 mV at a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. An overall water electrolytic cell using CoMoP@Co3O4-x nanorods as both electrodes can reach 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.614 V with outstanding durability. The improvement is realized by the synergistic effect of oxygen vacancies, Mo/P doping, and core-shell heterostructures for modulating the electronic structure and producing more active sites, which suggests a promising method for developing cost-effective and stable electrocatalysts.									2	1	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000751884800062	34756011

Time-resolved X-ray diffraction in combination with voltage step chrono-amperometric measurements in a solid state electrochemical cell provides a deeper insight into the chemical expansion mechanism in the GBCO electrode. The chemical expansion coefficient along the c-axis, (c), shows a negative value upon the compound oxidation contrary to standard perovskite materials with disordered oxygen vacancies. Chemical expansion also shows a remarkable asymmetry from (c) = -0.037 to -0.014 at < 0 and > 0, respectively. This change in chemical expansion is an indication of a different mechanism of the structural changes associated with the variable Co cation oxidation state from Co2+ Co3+ Co4+. Since redox reactions are dominated by oxygen surface exchange between the GBCO electrode and gas atmosphere, monitoring the time response of the structural changes allows for direct determination of oxygen reduction and evolution reaction kinetics. The reaction kinetics are progressively slowed down upon reduction in the < 0 oxygen stoichiometry region, while they maintain a high catalytic activity in the > 0 region, in agreement with the structural changes and the electronic carrier delocalization when crossing = 0. This work validates the time-resolved XRD technique for fast and reversible measurements of electrode activity in a wide range of oxygen non-stoichiometry in a solid-state electrochemical cell operating under realistic working conditions.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000437469300025

Herein, we report the one-step facile fabrication of ternary PtVCo alloyed dendrites as highly efficient bifunctional catalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as well as their deployment for both overall water splitting and rechargeable Zn-air batteries. Their HER activity and long-term durability were superior to those of commercial Pt/C, and their OER performance was close to that of the standard IrO2 catalyst. The PtVCo modified electrode can catalyze water splitting very efficiently. Furthermore, in the self-assembled rechargeable Zn-air battery test, PtVCo exhibited a narrow charge-discharge voltage gap of 0.88 V and a maximal power density of 235 mW cm(-2), which outperformed the performance of Pt/C. The excellent performance of PtVCo is mainly attributed to the synergistic contributions from Pt, V and Co, as the introduction of two transition metals significantly alters the electronic structure and the surface local ordering arrangements.									19	2	0	0	0	0	20			2052-1553			WOS:000448340900004

The hydrogen evolution rates of cathode at different reaction conditions were experimentally measured in the electrocatalysis synthesis process of chromic anhydride. The mathematical models were established for the dependence of hydrogen evolution rate and hydrogen evolution amount on initial potassium dichromate concentration, reaction temperature, and reaction time.It was pointed out that the cathodic hydrogen evolution rate quantitatively measured may be used to characterize the electrocatalytic reaction process of chromic anhydride, and the influencing factors of hydrogen evolution rate and hydrogen evolution amount were discussed.			针对铬酸酐传统生产技术存在的高污染、高消耗、工艺落后等问题,研究了以重铬酸钾为原料,电催化合成铬酸酐绿色新技术.循环伏安法研究了阳极的电催化性能,扫描电镜分析了表面形貌.结果表明,自制钌/铱/钛氧化物复合阳极在阳极电解液中具有较低的析氧过电位和稳定的高催化活性。实验测得不同反应条件下阴极析氢速率,建立了析氢速率和析氢量随阳极液重铬酸钾初始浓度、反应温度及反应时间变化的数学模型,指出阴极析氢速率可用于定量表征铬酸酐电催化反应进程,讨论了析氢速率和析氢量的影响因素.						0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1004-1656			CSCD:6637760

While they are ubiquitous in catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), redox processes occurring on the surface of manganese oxides are poorly understood. We report valence changes at OER- and ORR-relevant voltages of a layered manganese oxide film prepared by electrodeposition. X-ray absorption spectra were collected in situ in O-2-saturated 0.1 M KOH using inverse partial fluorescence yield (IPFY) at the Mn L-3,(2)-edges and partial fluorescence yield (PFY) at the O K-edge. Overall, we found reversible yet hysteretic Mn redox and qualitatively reproducible spectral changes by Mn L3,2 IPFY XAS. Oxidation to a mixed Mn3+/4+ valence preceded the oxygen evolution at 1.65 V vs RHE, while manganese reduced below Mn3+ and contained tetrahedral Mn2+ during oxygen reduction at 0.5 V vs RHE. Analysis of the pre-edge in O K-edge XAS provided the MnO hybridization, which was highest for Mn3+ (e(g)(1)). Our study demonstrates that combined in situ experiments at the metal L- and oxygen K-edges are indispensable to identify both the active valence during catalysis and the hybridization with oxygen adsorbates, critical to the rational design of active catalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis									95	2	0	0	4	0	95			1932-7447			WOS:000408598600015

Because the activity and stability of electrocatalysts depend significantly on physicochemical properties, material surface and interface engineering can offer a practical way to boost performance. To date, significant advances have been made using a judicious combination of advanced theoretical computations and spectroscopic characterizations. To provide a critical assessment of this field, we focus on the establishment of material property-catalytic activity relationships. We start with a detailed exploration of prevailing OER mechanisms in acid solution through evaluating the role of catalyst lattice oxygen. We then critically review advances in surface and interface engineering in acidic OER electrocatalysts from both experimental and theoretical perspectives. Finally, a few promising research orientations are proposed to inspire future investigation of high-performance PEM catalysts.									139	8	0	0	8	0	141			2380-8195			WOS:000496040800021

Transition metal-based electrocatalysts can be effective as water-splitting catalytic materials because of their appropriate redox properties and natural abundance, but the slow kinetics because of strong adsorption and consequently slow desorption of intermediates on the active sites of catalysts severely hamper the dynamics of the released molecular oxygen and thus remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the development of structurally and surface-modified PA-Gd-Ni(OH)(2)Cl (partially alkylated gadolinium-doped nickel oxychloride) nano-clusters (NCs, size <= 3 nm) for enhanced and stable OER catalysis at low overpotential and high turnover frequency. The ameliorated catalytic performance was achieved by controlling the surface coverage of these NCs with hydrophobic ligands and through the incorporation of electronegative atoms to facilitate easy adsorption/desorption of intermediates on the catalyst surface, thus improving the liberation of O-2. Such a surface and structural modification and uniform distribution at the nanoscale length are indeed worth considering to selectively tune the catalytic potential and further modernize the electrode materials for the challenging OER process.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000611066000042	33356129

The highly tunable chemical and physical properties of earth-abundant molybdenum oxides make them versatile for their incorporation into electrochemical and catalytic systems. Due to the layered crystal arrangement of orthorhombic alpha-MoO3, this material can be exfoliated into two dimensional (2D) nanosheets, featuring a large surface area. Variations in the oxidation states of molybdenum facilitate the crystal structure, morphology and oxygen vacancy tuning, making these oxide compounds suitable for electrochemical activities. Here, oxygen deficient 2D alpha-MoO3-x nanosheets (x = 0.045) are successfully synthesised, using a liquid phase exfoliation method, which display superior activity for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a low overpotential and fast electron transfer. In alkaline media, the 2D compound exhibits an overpotential value of 142 mV at the standard current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with excellent stability. Here, the 2D morphology, structural defects and oxygen vacancies in the planar construction of molybdenum oxide nanosheets significantly increase the active sites of the catalyst, which act as key factors to promote the HER performance.

However, it is difficult to control the composition of the HEAs that contain highly volatile metals by the conventional arc melting method. In this paper, homogeneous powdery face centered cubic (FCC) phase Fe0.5CoNiCuZnx HEAs were prepared by the electrolysis of metal oxides in molten Na2CO3-K2CO3 using a stable Ni11Fe10Cu inert oxygen-evolution anode. The use of oxide precursors and relatively low synthetic temperature are beneficial to efficiently preparing HEAs that contain highly volatile elements such as Zn. Moreover, the microstructures and compositions of the electrolytic HEAs can be easily tailored by adjusting the components of oxide precursors, then further regulating its properties. Thus, the electrocatalytic activity of Fe0.5CoNiCuZnx HEAs towards oxygen evolution reactions (OER) was investigated in 1 M KOH. The results show that Zn promotes the OER activity of Fe0.5CoNiCuZnx HEAs, i.e., the HEA(Zn-0.8) shows the best OER activity exhibiting a low overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and excellent stability of 24 h. Hence, molten salt electrolysis not only provides a green approach to prepare Fe0.5CoNiCuZnx HEAs but also offers an effective way to regulate the structure of the alloys and thereby optimizes the electrocatalytic activities for water electrolysis.

In this work, NiMoO4 with different doping levels of aluminum stoichiometry are synthesized (named as Al-NiMoO4-rods, Al-NiMoO4-sheets) by a simple one-step hydrothermal method. Doping of aluminum leads to the changes of structure for material, which increases the number of active sites and conductivity, and more gas channels are beneficial to facilitate the release of gas to achieve the purpose of improving electrochemical performance. Benefiting from the good electrochemical conductivity and structural stability, the Al-NiMoO4-rods can achieve good performance of HER activity, with an overpotential of 131 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and OER activity with an overpotential of 259 mV at the current density of 50 mA cm(-2) and small Tafel slopes of 82 mV dec(-1) and 117 mV dec(-1), respectively, outperforming the comparative samples. The results of this investigation show that Al play an important role in determin-ing the structure and electrochemical properties of Al-NiMoO4-rods, which can serve as an efficient and bifunctional electrocatalyst.

It is essential to exploit a desirable electrocatalyst with specific structure and activity to partially solve the problems of Li-O-2 batteries. In this work, an efficient catalyst of porous nanocubes La0.9Co0.8Ni0.2O3-x perovskite (PN-LCN) has been synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method, with the special porous morphology and abundant oxygen vacancies. Hence, Li-O-2 batteries with the PN-LCN can deliver a specific discharge capacity of 14,360 mAh g(-1) with a coulombic efficiency of 88% and a cycle stability of over 100 cycles at 300 mA g(-1), which is much better than that with dense particles La0.9Co0.8Ni0.2O3-x perovskite (DP-LCN) at the same current density. The PN-LCN with special morphology and abundant oxygen vacancies is demonstrated to be an efficient catalyst towards both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, with promising the application in Li-O-2 batteries.

In this work, a novel composite catalyst with in situ grown Co2P2O7 on nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets (Co2P2O7/N-rGO) was fabricated by a facile one-step pyrolysis method. Pyrolysis temperature was found to have a significant effect on the morphology, structure and ORR performance of the composites. The catalyst fabricated at 800 degrees C (Co2P2O7/N-rGO-800) presented ultrasmall Co2P2O7 nanocrystals (below 5 nm) anchored on N-rGO and the highest pyridinic-N proportion. Benefiting from the full exposure of active sites on the ultrasmall Co2P2O7 nanocrystals, abundant pyridinic-N species and the synergistic effect of Co2P2O7 and N-doped graphene, optimized Co2P2O7/N-rGO-800 not only demonstrates excellent ORR catalytic activity with a positive cathodic peak potential (0.823 V vs. 0.833 V of the commercial Pt/C catalyst), but also shows superior durability and methanol crossover resistance to Pt/C in alkaline solution. In addition, the composite catalyst also exhibits reasonable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance and impressive OER stability in KOH solution. These findings suggest that the Co2P2O7/N-rGO catalysts may be promising candidates as oxygen electrocatalysts for future energy conversion applications.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000468631600006

However, structure-dependent catalytic activities have been rarely understood for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) within Li-O-2 batteries. Here, we succeeded in the preparation of a Pt catalyst with an anisotropic structure and demonstrated its high catalytic activity in nonaqueous Li-O-2 batteries. The cathode incorporating Pt exposed with high-index {411} facets showed greatly enhanced ORR and OER performance in comparison to commercial Pt/C cathode. The anisotropic Pt catalyst improved ORR activity with a large capacity of 12 985 mAh g(carbon)(-1), high rate performance, and stable cyclic retention up to 70 cycles with the capacity limited to 1000 mAh g(carbon)(-1) Furthermore, the anisotropic Pt catalyst exhibited high round-trip efficiency of similar to 87% with a low OER potential (3.1 V) at a current density of 200 mA g(carbon)(-1) Our first-principles calculations revealed that the high-index facets, which contain step edge, kink, and ledge sites, are significantly more reactive than the lown terms of surface energy and O-binding energy.									44	2	0	0	2	0	43			2155-5435			WOS:000447224100006

In OER, the transition from singlet oxygen species to triplet oxygen molecules is involved, meanwhile the ORR involves the transition from triplet oxygen molecules to singlet oxygen species. However, in these processes, the number of unpaired electrons is not conserved, which is not thermodynamically favorable and creates an additional energy barrier. Fortunately, regulating the electrocatalysis by spin-state modulation enables a unique effect on the catalytic performance, but the current understanding on spin-state engineering for electro-catalyzing ORR and OER is still insufficient. Herein, this review summarized the in-spin engineering for the state-of-the-art ORR and OER electrocatalysts. It began by introducing engineering of spin-state to e(g) filling for ORR and OER process, and then moved to spin polarization and spin-pinning effect for OER process. Various designed strategies focusing on how to regulate the spin-state of the active center have been summarized up. The connectivity of the structures of typical ORR (e.g. metal-nitrogen-carbon) and OER (e.g. design strategies oxides, metal organic frameworks) catalysts depending on the spin level is also discussed. Finally, we present the outlook from the aspects of template catalysts, characterization methods, regulation strategies, theoretical calculations, which will further expand the possibility of better electrocatalytic performance through spin-state modulation. This review concluded some open suggestions and prospects, which are worthy of the community's future work.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0953-8984	1361-648X		WOS:000820847500001	35709712

Combined Rietveld analysis of neutron and X-ray powder diffraction data shows a novel ordering of oxygen vacancies not known before for barium cobaltates. A combination of neutron powder diffraction, magnetic measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) studies confirms G-type antiferromagnetic ordering. From impedance measurements, the electronic conductivity of the order of 10(-4) S cm(-1) is determined. Remarkably, the bifunctional catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is found to be comparable to that of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-y, confirming that charge-ordered anion deficient non-cubic perovskites can be highly efficient catalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000656935600001	33908660

In this work, two strategies of alloying of Co with Ni and enclosing of electrocatalysts with carbonaceous materials were both used to accelerate the catalytic efficiency of cobalt selenide for water splitting. The nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layer improves the reaction kinetics by efficient charge transfer. The alloying of metal into composited electrocatalysts can modify the electronic properties of host materials, thereby tuning the adsorption behavior of intermediate and improving the electrocatalytic activity. As expected, Nyquist plots reveal that the charge-transfer resistance (R-ct) of nickel cobalt selenide encapsulated into nitrogen-doped carbon layer (CoNiSe/NC-3, Co:Ni =1:1) are just 5 and 9 Omega for HER and OER, respectively, which are much lower than those of CoSe/NC-1 (Co:Ni = 1:0) (81 and 138 Omega) and CoNiSe/NC-3 without NC (CoNiSe-3) (54 and 25 Omega). With the high charge transfer and porous structure, CoNiSe/NC-3 shows good performance for both HER and OER. When current density reaches 10 mA cm(-2), only 100 and 270 mV overpotentials are required for HER and OER, respectively. With the potential of 1.65 V, full water splitting also can be catalyzed by CoNiSe/NC-3 with current density of 20 mA cm(-2), suggesting that CoNiSe/NC-3 could be used as replacement for noble metal electrocatalysts.

However, the sluggish cathode reaction kinetics severely hampered the efficiency of nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR). Developing high performance photocatalyst is highly pursued for boosting NO3RR. In this study, Bi2MoO6 nanosheets with massive oxygen vacancies are fabricated through hydrothermal reaction and subsequent plasma modification. Maximal nitrate conversion yield of 38% with the high N-2 selectivity of 80.0% is achieved for photocatalytic NO3RR. The underlying photocatalytic mechanism is systemically investigated through comprehensive approaches. The enhanced nitrate conversion efficiency is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect between deliberately generated oxygen vacancies and Mo active sites, capturing O and N atoms of nitrate, respectively, thus promoting the adsorption of nitrate and cleavage of N-O bond. Furthermore, the H "repulsion" effect of Bi efficiently suppresses hydrogenation reaction, resulting in greatly enhanced N-2 selectivity.[GRAPHICS].									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000776506100002

USE - Manufacture of multilayered catalyst structure for electrode (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The whole deposition process using AACVD is simple, low cost, and fast for batch production and utilization at industrial scale. The synthesis of nanostructured cobalt oxide films over a nanostructured gold film with high catalytic performance towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be achieved using a simple, facile, and rapid method of AACVD and commercially available precursor(s). The intrinsic material properties upon a gold (or similar metal or alloy) film has a more significant role in catalytic activity than the surface area factor. Using AACVD, a high deposition rate for the metal oxide film is achieved with higher number of active sites for the catalytic process. Even a 5-minute deposition can produce a dispersed monolayer of nanoparticles. The catalytic performance of such rapidly prepared film can be comparable to or even better than tediously prepared films of the art, e.g., in terms of current density, onset potential, and/or overpotential. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for:(1) conducting an oxygen evolution reaction which involves contacting electrolyte solution with an electrode comprising glass layer, gold layer, and aerosol assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD)-deposited cobalt oxide layer, where contacting generates oxygen (O2) from the aqueous solution, optionally at an onset overpotential in a range of 320-340 mV and/or with an overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 in a range of 460-500 mV; and(2) electrode comprising glass layer, gold layer having a thickness of 25-100 nm, and AACVD-deposited cobalt oxide layer having a thickness of 100-1500 nm.															0						DIIDW:202082691W

Surface energy and related catalytic mechanisms are widely studied. However, the catalyst lattice deformation induced by catalytic processes is not well understood. Here, we study the strain in an individual platinum (Pt) nanoparticle (NP) using Bragg coherent diffraction imaging under in situ oxidation and reduction reactions. When Pt NPs are exposed to H2O2, a typical oxidizer and an intermediate during the oxygen reduction reaction process, alternating overall strain distribution near the surface and inside the NP is observed at the (111) Bragg reflection. In contrast, relatively insignificant changes appear in the (200) reflection. Density functional theory calculations are employed to rationalize the anisotropic lattice strain in terms of induced stress by H2O2 adsorption and decomposition on the Pt NP surface.

WO3 photoanodes have been reported to degrade in aqueous solutions with pH > 3 due to the material's Arrhenius acidity and the potential formation of reactive peroxide intermediates on the WO3 surface during the course of photoelectrochemical water oxidation. The stability during photoelectrochemical OER of WO3 and WO3-FeOOH photoanodes was measured at 1.23 V vs. RHE at pH 4 and 7 in phosphate-buffered solutions. Additionally, the faradaic efficiencies of the electrodes for OER were measured at pH 4. WO3-FeOOH electrodes demonstrate a 95.9 +/- 1.6% faradaic efficiency for OER in pH 4 potassium phosphate buffer at current densities of similar to 0.75 mA cm(-2) under 200 mW cm(-2) AM1.5G illumination and an applied bias of 1.43 V vs. RHE. These experiments demonstrate that adding an FeOOH co-catalyst dramatically improves the stability of the electrodes, selectivity, and rate of OER versus that observed on WO3 films.									47	2	0	0	1	0	47			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000371077300022

Metal-organic frameworks (MOF) are promising candidates as precursor materials in the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage applications. This review starts with a summary of basic concepts and key evaluation parameters involved in the electrochemical water-splitting reaction. Then, different synthesis approaches reported for the cobalt-based Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) and its derivatives are critically reviewed. Additionally, several strategies employed to enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability of ZIF-67-based electrocatalysts are discussed in detail. The present review provides a succinct insight into the ZIF-67 and its derivatives (oxides, hydroxides, sulfides, selenides, phosphide, nitrides, telluride, heteroatom/metal-doped carbon, noble metal-supported ZIF-67 derivatives) reported for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water splitting applications. Finally, this review concludes with the associated challenges and the perspectives on developing the best economic, durable electrocatalytic materials.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000749577600001	34846082

The development of highly active and robust OER catalysts is in high demand. A series of three-dimensional (3D) self-supported FeOOH@Ni(OH)2 heterostructures supported on nickel foam are synthesized and used as efficient OER catalysts using a simple hydrothermal method. The benefits of the appropriate 3D nanoflower morphology, the large number of FeOOH nanosheets adhered on the nanoflower surface, the formation of heterogeneous interfaces, and the synergistic effect of Ni(OH)2 and FeOOH significantly improve the OER catalytic performance of the material. The optimal catalyst in 1 M KOH, alkaline artificial seawater (1 M KOH + 1 M NaCl), and alkaline nature seawater (1 M KOH + seawater) require only 285, 286, and 325 mV overpotential, respectively, to achieve 100 mA cm-2 current density and has robust stability. This study contributes to the rational design of interface-engineered heterostructures for seawater splitting by synthesizing high catalytic activity catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0925-8388	1873-4669		WOS:000806550100004

Organic RRs are appealing candidates for this application; however, their instability limits their utility. Here we show that a tetrathioether-substituted quinone, tetramercaptopropanesulfonate quinone (TMQ), exhibits significantly enhanced stability relative to anthraquinone-2,7-disulfonate, the most effective organic RR reported previously. The enhanced stability, confirmed by symmetric flow-battery experiments under relevant conditions, enables the stable electrochemical production of H-2 and O-2 in a continuous-flow electrolysis cell. The reduced RR, tetramercaptopropanesulfonate hydroquinone, is not susceptible to decomposition, whereas the oxidized state, TMQ, undergoes slow decomposition, evident only after sustained operation (>60 h). The analysis of the byproducts provides the basis for a decomposition mechanism, establishing a foundation for the design of new organic RRs with even better performance.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2380-8195			WOS:000639063800032	34017916

Herein we report an electrocatalyst in which sulfur atoms are doping in the oxygen vacancies (V-O) of inverse spinel NiFe2O4 (S-NiFe2O4) to create active sites with enhanced electron transfer capability. This electrocatalyst has an ultralow overpotential of 61 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and long-term stability of 60 h at 1.0 Acm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH media. In situ Raman spectroscopy revealed that S sites adsorb hydrogen adatom (H*) and in situ form S-H*, which favor the production of hydrogen and boosts HER in alkaline solution. DFT calculations further verified that S introduction lowered the energy barrier of H2O dissociation. Both experimental and theoretical investigations confirmed S atoms are active sites of the S-NiFe2O4.									62	3	0	0	1	0	63			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000648080900001	33843135

However, the working mechanism of cocatalysts is still not fully understood. In this work, we have performed density functional theory calculations on alpha-Ga2O3 loaded with the nickel oxide cocatalyst, which is a highly active photocatalyst of decomposing water in the UV region. We have investigated the adsorption behavior of NinOn (n = 1, 2, 4, 6) clusters on (001) and (012) surfaces of alpha-Ga2O3. It is found that all NinOn clusters adsorb strongly on both (001) and (012) surfaces, with adsorption energies ranging from -3.9 to -6.6 eV. The more stable adsorption configurations have a larger number of new interfacial bonds formed between the surface and the cluster. The calculated density of states demonstrates that the adsorption of NinOn clusters on the (012) surface is more favorable to the separation and transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes. Our results reveal that on the alpha-Ga2O3 surfaces covered with the nickel oxide cocatalyst, the active site of hydrogen evolution reaction is the oxygen atom on the surface, and the interfacial dissociation of water is most stable because of the formation of more bonds. The favorable site of oxygen evolution reaction is on the highly unsaturated Ni atoms in NinOn clusters. The two-half reactions of decomposing water occur at the different sites in the photocatalytic system, which benefits the separation of electrons and holes. Our calculations have reasonably explained the experimental observation on the significant enhancement of activity for photocatalytic water-splitting reaction after loading the nickel oxide cocatalyst in alpha-Ga2O3.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000464768600059

In this work, we synthesize amorphous Co1-xVxSy nanosheets using Co1-xVx-MOF/NF as a precursor to explore the structural evolution of metal-organic framework (MOF) derivatives during the OER. When tested for OER performance in 1.0 M KOH solution, Co0.9V0.1S0.002/NF exhibits the best catalytic activity, with an overpotential of only 194 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 28.4 mV dec(-1). We also measured the long-term electrochemical durability of Co0.9V0.1S0.002/NF and found that Co0.9V0.1S0.002/NF maintains its stability for at least 100 h at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000780476500001

Herein, we achieve the synthesis of metal-organic framework precursor of Cu[Fe(CN)(6)]center dot XH2O cube at room temperature, which further derived ferric oxide@cupric oxide alloy ball. On this foundation, we creatively synthesized ferric oxide@cupric oxide alloy ball on nitrogen-doped graphene (NG@Fe2O3/CuO alloy ball), where Fe2O3/CuO alloy ball is evenly anchored on nitrogen-doped graphene. It is worth noting that nitrogen doping, reduction of graphene oxide and conversion of Cu[Fe(CN)(6)]center dot XH2O cube precursor into Fe2O3/CuO alloy ball can be simultaneously realized by facile one-step calcination. Moreover, synergistic effect between the nitrogen-doped graphene and Fe2O3/CuO alloy ball can enhance the overall electrocatalytic performance of the catalyst by playing specific roles. The outstanding catalytic activity, long-term durability and stability make NG@Fe2O3/CuO alloy ball to become a promising non-precious electrocatalyst for electrochemical water oxidation.

Using density functional theory calculations, we have systematically investigated the catalytic mechanism and catalytic performance of siligraphenes as cathode catalysts in nonaqueous Li-O-2 batteries. For the siligraphenes studied here, Li2O is the final discharge product. Among them, the single-layered SiC (SL-SiC) exhibits potential as a suitable cathode catalyst due to the considerably low overpotential values during discharge and charge process. That is, 0.73 V for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and 1.87 V for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The quantitative analysis indicates that the ORR overpotential on siligraphenes is linearly correlated with the DEads of the last added Li in Li4O2* (* denotes the adsorbed surface), while the OER overpotential is linearly correlated with the E-ads of LiO2 on surface. Our investigations elucidate quantitative correlations between the catalytic performance of siligraphenes and the adsorption performance of Li-contained intermediates on them, which provides promising approach to develop metal-free cathode catalysts with high catalytic activity.

Herein, we report a rational design of a new kind of photocatalyst, in which SrTiO3-T/Cd0.5Zn0.5S heterostructure is prepared via a simple hydrothermal method. SrTiO3 with oxygen vacancy is prepared by a controllable solid-state reaction of NaBH4 and SrTiO3 nanocrystals. The oxygen vacancies on the surface of SrTiO3 can be used as electron traps to attract electrons from Cd0.5Zn0.5S and provide proton reduction sites for H-2 production during the photocatalysis processing, thereby effectively inhibit the recombination of electron-hole pairs. It has demonstrated that SrTiO3-T/Cd0.5Zn0.5S nanocomposites can achieve the highest photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 25.01 mmol g 1 h(-1) under visible light, which is about 2 times than that of the original Cd0.5Zn0.5S.									30	2	0	0	4	0	30			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000490030800090

The optimized Co5.0Mo1P/NiFe-LDH hybrid obtained via the hydrothermal-phosphating-electrodeposition process consists of hierarchical nanosheet arrays including some silky and ultrathin NiFe-LDH nanosheets and numerous tiny and crosslinking Co5.0Mo1P nanoplates. Electrochemical tests display that Ni foam (NF)/Co5.0Mo1P/NiFe-LDH not only exhibits outstanding performance toward both HER and OER with an HER overpotential (eta at 10 mA/cm(2)) of 98.9 mV and an OER overpotential (at 50 mA/cm(2)) of 225 mV outperforming NF/Co5.0Mo1P and NF/CoP but also presents superb stability in 1.0 M KOH. Moreover, it affords a cell voltage for water splitting of 1.68 V at 50 mA/cm(2) with an excellent durability for more than 27 h. The abundant and intensive exposure of active sites provided by 2D porous and hierarchical nanosheet arrays and a strong electronic coupling and fast electronic transmission between various interfaces would explain the improved performance. In addition, the anchor effect between Co/Mo phosphides and NiFe-LDHs prevents corrosion of electrolyte solution and slows down the dissolution of the P element. This efficient and highly stable bifunctional electrode can serve as a practical electrode for electrochemical energy storage and conversion.									40	2	0	0	3	0	41			2574-0962			WOS:000563784400086

It can produce pressurised hydrogen by using low cost non-noble metal catalysts. However, the performances are still lower than that of the conventional PEM electrolysis technology. In this study, we addressed the performance issue by using a novel combination of Ni-Fe-O(x)for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and Ni-Fe-Co hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrodes with a PBI anion exchange membrane. The Ni-Fe-O(x)and Ni-Fe-Co electrodes exhibit exceptionally high catalytic activity, requiring over potentials that are as low as 236 and 84 mV dec(-1), respectively, for OER and HER to occur. These electrocatalysts exhibits excellent durability which can be used as oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution catalysts for long term electrolysis. The high rate capability of 1000 mA cm(-2)at 1.9 V and 60 degrees C demonstrates the potential of the combined membrane electrode assembly. The best performance, which is comparable to those of commercial PEM electrolysis systems, is thus an affordable alternative to this technology. In addition to that, the AEM electrolysis is promising on a multi-scale level for long-term hydrogen production.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16				2046-2069		WOS:000578727600048	35521279

Herein, theoretical calculations identify that the local distortion-strain effect in amorphous RuTe2 system abnormally sensitizes the Te-p pi coupling capability and enhances the electron-transfer of Ru-sites, in which the excellent inter-orbital p-d transfers determine strong electronic activities for boosting OER performance. Thus, a robust electrocatalyst based on amorphous RuTe2 porous nanorods (PNRs) is successfully fabricated. In the acidic water splitting, a-RuTe2 PNRs exhibit a superior performance, which only require a cell voltage of 1.52 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Detailed investigations show that the high density of defects combine with oxygen atoms to form RuOxHy species, which are conducive to the OER. This work offers valuable insights for constructing robust electrocatalysts based on theoretical calculations guided by rational design and amorphous materials.									133	6	0	0	7	0	131				2041-1723		WOS:000502254500001	31831748

However, the sluggish oxidation half reaction, namely, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), usually requires a high overpotential, which is the obstacle to high-efficiency overall water splitting to generate H-2. Herein, we report the preparation of ultrathin nanosheet array Ni3S2 with a 9-14 nm nanosheet thickness grown directly on a commercial Ni foam substrate (Ni3S2/NF) by in situ vapor-phase hydrothermal (VPH) transformation of the nanosheet array structure Ni(OH)(2)/NF precursor. As a multifunctional electrocatalyst, the as-fabricated Ni3S2/NF-2 (VPH time of 2 h) displays excellent electrocatalytic activities toward the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) with a potential of 0.415 V (vs. RHE) to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm(-2), an OER with an overpotential of 425 mV obtaining the same current density, and a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with an onset potential of -0.05 V (vs. RHE) in 1.0 M KOH media. A two-electrode system is therefore constructed using Ni3S2/NF-2 as both the anode and cathode, capable of achieving 100 mA cm(-2) at 0.867 V in 1.0 M KOH with 0.2 M hydrazine. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the adsorption of N2H4 molecules on the Ni3S2 (110) is more thermodynamically favourable than H2O, thus contributing to the high HzOR activity.									40	4	0	0	1	0	41			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000448412000050		
J	Cao, Can; Xie, Jian; Zhang, Shichao; Pan, Bin; Cao, Gaoshao; Zhao, Xinbing								Graphene-like delta-MnO2 decorated with ultrafine CeO2 as a highly efficient catalyst for long-life lithium-oxygen batteries								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				5	14			6747	6755		10.1039/c7ta00416h				APR 14 2017	2017	Lithium-oxygen (Li-O-2) cells are receiving intense interest because of their extremely high energy density. A highly efficient catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key factor influencing the performance of lithium-oxygen cells. In this work, we prepared a highly efficient CeO2-decorated d-MnO2 (CeO2/delta-MnO2) catalyst which is composed of graphene-like delta-MnO2 with ultrafine CeO2 nanocrystals decorated on it. Li-O-2 cells with the CeO2/delta-MnO2 catalyst exhibit superior electrochemical performance, including high discharge specific capacity (8260 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1)), good rate capability (735 mA h g(-1) at 1600 mA g(-1)), and excellent cycling stability (296 cycles at a limited capacity of 500 mA h g(-1)), which is much better than that with a bare delta-MnO2 catalyst. The achievement of excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the highly efficient co-catalytic ability of delta-MnO2 and CeO2 and the desirable graphene-like architecture of the CeO2/delta-MnO2 catalyst, as well as the formation of the thin-layered discharge product Li2O2.									42	3	0	0	1	0	42			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000398323400046

In this work, a facile strategy for the scalable fabrication of cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (Co@NC) was used. The experimental results and density functional theory calculations demonstrated that carbon nanotubes with a good graphitization degree were obtained by introducing a certain amount of cobalt species. The Co@NC-3 catalyst exhibited good catalytic performance, with a potential gap (DE) between the E-j=10 value of the OER and ORR half-wave potential (E-1/2) of only 0.816 V, which is lower than that of many highly efficient bifunctional catalysts reported in the literature. Moreover, rechargeable Zn-air batteries based on the Co@NC-3 catalyst generated a high power density (163.4 mW.cm(-2)) and specific capacity (795.5 mA h.g(-1) at 10 mA.cm(-2)). The results confirm that Co@NC-3 could be used as a highly efficient bifunctional catalyst for renewable energy conversion devices. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The crystalline structures, morphologies, Co/Mn valence states and oxygen adsorption/desorption behavior of the LSCM materials are systematically studied, and their catalytic activities toward ORR and OER are investigated by the rotating-disk electrode (RDE) and zinc-air battery techniques. It is found that the proper substitution of Co with Mn can efficiently improve the ORR and OER activities of La0.8Sr0.2CoO3 perovskite at the same time. The LSCM-60 catalyst exhibits the optimum bi-functional activity. It is mainly attributed to the regulation of the Bi-site Co/Mn valence states and the improvement of the oxygen adsorption/desorption capability. Besides of the good bifunctional property, LSCM-60 shows superior durability compared with Pt/C and IrO2 catalysts. When using LSCM-60 as the cathode catalyst of zinc-air batteries, the low charge-discharge overpotential (1.05 Vat 50 mAcm (2)) and the excellent long-term cycle stability were obtained. This study exhibits the possibility to improve the bi-functional activity of La0.8Sr0.2CoO3 through a simple doping process. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We use complementary techniques to show that multiple unique Fe(iii) coordination environments exist in FexNi1-x(OH)(2) synthesized by alkaline precipitation. Samples synthesized with formamide added to the reaction vessel yield Mossbauer and Raman spectra consistent with Fe(iii) successfully incorporated into the Ni(OH)(2) lattice. Additional spectroscopic features emerge for samples synthesized in the absence of formamide, revealing a second Fe(iii) coordination environment. Correlations in structural information derived from the numerous characterization techniques suggest that the secondary environment sits atop the 2-dimensional Ni(OH)(2) sheets. X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy fail to resolve this second site, but show that Fe(iii) induces a non-uniform structural contraction that distorts the Ni(OH)(2) lattice for all samples. Electrocatalytic oxygen evolution is qualitatively similar for both sample series, but samples synthesized in the presence of formamide consistently outperform those from conventional pH precipitation. Iron ions within the Ni(OH)(2) lattice are therefore deemed to be the catalytically relevant structural feature. The identification of a secondary iron site demonstrates that qualitative similarities in electrochemical behavior mask quantitative differences in structure and electrocatalytic competence.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000798704200001

Herein, a shape-control of hexagon nickel cobalt oxide spinel nanosheets was reported to engineer the surface metal active sites for enhanced electrocatalysis of oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions (OER/ORR). Specifically, through simply tuning annealing temperature, different Ni3+/Ni2+ and Co3+/Co2+ atomic configurations on the nickel cobalt oxide surface were controllably synthesized. Electrochemical results show that the oxide treated at 250 degrees C (NCO-250) with the highest value of Ni3+/Ni2+ sites and the lowest value of Co3+/Co2+ sites exhibits superior OER/ORR activity in alkaline electrolytes and better discharge/charge performance in Zn-air batteries among all the samples. The optimized surface active site configuration of the NCO-250 sample leads to the optimal energy of adsorption, activation, and desorption for water molecules and oxygen species, thus promoting a high electrocatalytic activity. This work provides a strategy to design cost-effective, highly active, and durable electrocatalysts through regulating active sites on transition-metal surface for Zn-air battery and other advanced energy devices.									59	5	0	0	1	0	60			1944-8244			WOS:000458347900023	30537808

Its efficiency in both alkaline and acidic media is drastically limited by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) taking place at the anode side of modern electrolyzers. Numerous electrocatalysts have been proposed recently to increase the activity of the anodes; most of them are transition metal oxides and perovskite materials. However, the activities reported in the literature for these electrodes are in the majority of cases measured at low overpotentials, low or moderate current densities (often 10-50 mA cm(-2)), relatively diluted electrolytes (e.g., 0.1 M KOH), and room temperatures. However, commercial electrolyzers operate at current densities that are at least 1 order of magnitude larger, elevated temperatures, and significantly higher pHs. To enable new generation of electrocatalysts, it is important to evaluate their intrinsic activities under industrially relevant conditions. This is not a trivial task, neither in industry nor in research laboratories, particularly due to (i) formation of a nonconducting gas phase in the vicinity of the electrode under such conditions, (ii) limitations due to mass transfer and uncompensated resistances, and (iii) problems in determination of the real electroactive electrode surface area. In this work, with the use of microelectrodes, we evaluate intrinsic OER catalytic activities of several state-of-the-art nickel-, cobalt- and nickel/iron-oxide/hydroxide thin films at different temperatures (up to 80 degrees C), in 5.4 M KOH and at current densities up to several A cm(-2). Additionally, Ni-modified Pt electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction were also tested under similar conditions and compared with pure Pt electrodes.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2574-0962			WOS:000458706400078

Herein, an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst based on hollow cobalt oxide nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (Co/N-Pg) is fabricated for Zn-air batteries. A low-cost biomass peach gum, consisting of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen without other heteroatoms, was used as carbon source to form carbon matrix hosting hollow cobalt oxide nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the melamine was applied as nitrogen source and template precursor, which can convert to carbon-based template graphitic carbon nitride by polycondensation process. Owing to the unique structure and synergistic effect between hollow cobalt oxide nanoparticles and Co-N-C species, the proposal Co/N-Pg catalyst displays not only prominent bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for ORR and OER, but also excellent durability. Remarkably, the assembled Zn-air battery with Co/N-Pg air electrode exhibited a low discharge-charge voltage gap (0.81 V at 50 mA cm(-2)) and high peak power density (119 mW cm(-2)) with long-term cycling stability. This work presents an effective approach for engineering transition metal oxides and nitrogen modified carbon nanosheets to boost the performance of bifunctional electrocatalysts for Zn-air battery.

The influence of atomic and singlet molecular, oxygen in tire behavior of different polymers is investigated. It appears that the evolution of the surface energy can be explained by an initiation of the functionalization by the oxygen atoms impinging upon the surface followed by reaction of the radicals formed with molecular oxygen. The concentration of functions at the surface is limited due to their destruction by reaction with oxygen atoms. Furthermore, the functionalization level is higher in the flowing afterglow than in the plasma, without any significant degradation of the polymer surface. Therefore, the treatment in the flowing afterglow is more efficient to increase surface energy, in particular, for polymers which undergo high backbone chain scission.									52	0	0	0	2	1	53			0272-4324	1572-8986		WOS:A1995RD16900003

It remains highly challenging to develop oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with high activity and low cost under mild conditions. Here, a new composite material is reported based on ultrathin 2D Co3O4 nanosheets and reduced graphene oxides (rGO) by means of a one-pot hydrothermal strategy. The ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite shows superior stability under alkaline conditions and exhibits an overpotential of 290mV with a Tafel slope of 68mAdec(-1), which is much smaller than that of bare Co3O4 catalyst. Extensive experiments were also carried out using 0D CS and 1D CNTs (CS=carbon spheres, CNTs=carbon nanotubes) in place of the 2D rGO. The overpotentials of as-prepared nanocomposites decrease with the increase of the dimension of nanocarbons, suggesting the electrochemistry activity is closely related to the surface area of carbon substrates. In addition, compared with ultrathin 2D Co3O4 nanosheets with a Co2+/Co3+ ratio of 1.2, the as-prepared ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite with a Co2+/Co3+ ratio of 1.4 contributes to the better OER performance as more oxygen vacancies can be formed in the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite under the experimental conditions. Compared with other Co3O4-containing composite materials reported so far, the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposites show excellent OER performance.									41	1	0	0	0	0	42			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000397505400027	28150913

Unfortunately, as a result of extremely sluggish water dissociation kinetics (Volmer step), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of the NiFe-LDH is rather poor in alkaline environment. Here a novel strategy is demonstrated for substantially accelerating the hydrogen evolution kinetics of the NiFe-LDH by partially substituting Fe atoms with Ru. In a 1 m KOH solution, the as-synthesized Ru-doped NiFe-LDH nanosheets (NiFeRu-LDH) exhibit excellent HER performance with an overpotential of 29 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is much lower than those of noble metal Pt/C and reported electrocatalysts. Both experimental and theoretical results reveal that the introduction of Ru atoms into NiFe-LDH can efficiently reduce energy barrier of the Volmer step, eventually accelerating its HER kinetics. Benefitting from its outstanding HER activity and remained excellent OER activity, the NiFeRu-LDH steadily drives an alkaline electrolyzer with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.52 V, which is much lower than the values for Pt/C-Ir/C couple and state-of-the-art overall water-splitting electrocatalysts.									361	16	0	0	30	0	362			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000426720400027	29349907

Herein, for the first time, we realized the simultaneous nitrogen doping and etching of Co3O4 nanosheets to produce N-doped nanoporous Co3O4 nanosheets with oxygen vacancies by N-2 plasma. The increase in active sites in N-doped Co3O4 nanosheets and improved electronic conductivity with N doping and oxygen vacancies results in excellent electrocatalytic activity for the OER. Compared with pristine Co3O4 nanosheets, the N-doped Co3O4 nanosheets with oxygen vacancies have a much lower required potential of 1.54 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode than the pristine Co3O4 nanosheets (1.79 V) to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The N-doped and etched Co3O4 nanosheets have a much lower Tafel slope of 59 mV dec(-1) than pristine Co3O4 nanosheets (234 mV dec(-1)). The enhanced electrocatalytic activity for the OER is caused by the increased surface area, N doping and the produced oxygen vacancies.									94	4	0	0	5	0	95			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000413072800002	28319036

J	Liang, Hongxing; Liu, Jing								Insights on the Corrosion and Degradation of MXenes as Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction								CHEMCATCHEM				14	6					e202101375	10.1002/cctc.202101375		JAN 2022		MAR 22 2022	2022	MXenes, known as the graphene-like two-dimensional transition metal carbides, carbonitrides, or nitrides, have been considered as promising electrocatalysts to replace benchmark Pt for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Despite the success in fabricating MXenes, their application in catalysis still faces great challenges. One critical drawback is the rapid corrosion and structural evolution of MXenes during storage and HER. In this work, the corrosion and structural evolution of various MXenes in air, aqueous colloidal solutions, and under HER conditions are reviewed. The degradation/structural mechanism of MXenes and effects of structural evolution on the HER activity are in dispute. Preliminary protocols are proposed for future MXene storage and design for HER application. This review provides valuable information to better prevent corrosion of MXenes before and after servicing as HER catalysts, and to interpret the obtained HER performance for MXenes in the view of corrosion/structural evolution.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000741480700001

Herein, we investigate a new catalyst, P-3G, consisting of a cation-ordered perovskite (PrBa0.5Sr0.5)(0.95)Co1.5Fe0.5O5+delta (PBSCF) and 3D porous N-doped graphene (3DNG). This new type of composite electrocatalyst simultaneously exhibited outstanding multifunctional catalytic activities and excellent stabilities for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A possible mechanism for the synergistic effects between perovskite oxides and 3DNG on ORR, OER and HER was firstly proposed by DFT calculations. The electrocatalytic activity of P-3G appeared to have great potential for a rechargeable Zn-air battery system. The operating voltage differences between the charge and discharge (Delta(eta)) of P-3G and Pt/C-IrO2 after 110 cycles were 0.63 V and 0.87 V, respectively, indicating the substantial durability of P-3G. Moreover, a water-splitting device using P-3G efficiently produced H-2 and O-2 gases at rates of 0.859 mu L s(-1) and 0.417 mu L s(-1), respectively. This study highlights extended applications of coupled perovskite oxides/carbon materials as versatile electrocatalysts for ORR, OER, and HER and unveils the cause of synergistic interactions between oxide and carbon by DFT calculation.									82	5	0	0	4	0	83			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000457546000057

Here, heterolayered nanostructures of Ni-Fe hydroxides/oxides with high activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were synthesized on a 316 stainless steel (SS) substrate through constant current density electrolysis. The thicknesses, morphologies, and compositions of the nanostructures, generated through dealloying and surface oxidation of the SS elements with severe oxygen microbubble evolution, were dependent on the electrolysis time. Nanostructural analyses showed that the heterolayered Ni-Fe hydroxide/oxide nanostructures were generated during the initial stage of electrolysis, growing nanofiberlike Ni-Fe hydroxide layers with increasing electrolysis time of up to 5 h. The prolonged electrolysis resulted in densification of the nanofiber structures. The OER overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 was estimated to be 254 mV at 20 degrees C, demonstrating better performance than a standard OER catalyst, for example, Ir oxide, and obtaining the value of the Ni Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH). Furthermore, the OER property surpassed the Ni Fe LDH catalysts at high current density regions greater than 100 mA/cm(2). Moreover, stable electrolysis was achieved for 20 h under conditions similar to that of the practical AWE of 400 mA/cm(2) in 20 and 75 degrees C solution. Therefore, the simple surface modification method could synthesize highly active nanostructures for alkaline water splitting anodes.									29	2	0	0	1	0	29			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000500415700035	31670501

An effective approach to enhance the performance of SOCs at reduced temperatures is by developing highly active oxygen electrodes for both oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. Herein, highly conductive Sm3+ and Nd3+ double-doped ceria (Sm0.075Nd0.075Ce0.85O2-delta, SNDC) is utilized as an active component for reversible SOC applications. We develop a novel La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF)-SNDC composite oxygen electrode. Compared with the conventional LSCF-Gd-doped ceria oxygen electrode, the LSCF-SNDC exhibits similar to 35% lower cathode polarization resistance (0.042 Omega cm(2) at 750 degrees C) owing to rapid oxygen incorporation and surface diffusion kinetics. Furthermore, the SOC with the LSCF-SNDC oxygen electrode and the SNDC buffer layer yields a remarkable performance in both the fuel cell (1.54 W cm(-2) at 750 degrees C) and electrolysis cell (1.37 A cm(-2) at 750 degrees C) modes because the incorporation of SNDC promotes the surface diffusion kinetics at the oxygen electrode bulk and the activity of the triple phase boundary at the interface. These findings suggest that the highly conductive SNDC material effectively enhances both oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions, thus serving as a promising material in reversible SOC applications at reduced temperatures.									16	1	0	0	0	0	17			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000612551400032	33398987

In this work, we have introduced O-2 plasma to engineer Fe-doped Ni2P (Fe-Ni2P) nanosheets, which is grown on the conductive NiFe foam. Interestingly, this facile and rapid plasma treatment can simultaneously achieve defect engineering (P vacancies) and the formation of new species (phosphate). The P vacancies could modulate the electronic structure of the electrocatalyst for the OER process, while the formed phosphate species could facilitate water adsorption and improve the charge transfer. Consequently, the O-2-plasma treated Fe-Ni2P nanosheets with rough surface and nanoholes exhibit low overpotentials of 207 and 218 mV at 50 and 100 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope of 45 mV dec(-1) and excellent durability in alkaline electrolyte. Our work reveals the delicate structural transformation of the plasma-engineered material, and provides insights of the structure-property relationship of high-performance OER electrocatalyst.

To facilitate the design of such air intake systems, we have investigated the effects of oxygen partial pressure (<= 1 atm) on the performance of the Li-air cell, which has not been systematically examined. The amounts of consumed O-2 and evolved CO2 from the Li-air cell are measured with a custom in situ differential electrochemical gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (DEGC-MS). The amounts of consumed O-2 suggest that the oxygen partial pressure does not affect the reaction mechanism during discharge, and the two-electron reaction occurs under all test conditions. On the other hand, the charging behavior varies by the oxygen partial pressure. The highest O-2 evolution ratio is attained under 70% O-2, along with the lowest CO2 evolution. The cell cycle life also peaks at 70% O-2 condition. Overall, an oxygen partial pressure of about 0.5-0.7 atm maximizes the Li-air cell capacity and stability at 1 atm condition. The findings here indicate that the appropriate oxygen partial pressure can be a key factor when developing practical Li-air battery systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Zhao, Shuai; Yan, Litao; Luo, Hongmei; Mustain, William; Xu, Hui								Recent progress and perspectives of bifunctional oxygen reduction/evolution catalyst development for regenerative anion exchange membrane fuel cells								NANO ENERGY				47				172	198		10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.02.015				MAY 2018	2018	Regenerative anion exchange membranes fuel cells (AEMFCs) have been widely considered as energy conversion and storage devices due to their low cost and high-energy storage capacity, especially when integrated with renewable resources. However, the oxygen electrode reactions have long been one of the primary limiting factors of regenerative AEMFCs due to their sluggish kinetics and resulting high overpotentials. To date, nanoparticles of platinum-group metals (PGMs) have been primary applied as catalysts because they are widely believed to simultaneously lower the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers of the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER), which occur at a single electrode in unitized regenerative fuel cells (URFCs). However, the high-cost and scarcity of PGMs have recently shifted more researchers' attention to nanostructured transition metal oxide-based non-PGM catalysts as alternatives for regenerative AEMFCs. Based on a theoretical analysis of the ORR/OER mechanism, the rate limiting steps of this reversible reaction pair has differing catalytic requirements, which make it challenging to develop effective bifunctional electrocatalysts with single active sites. Therefore, this review focuses on the development of ORR/OER dual active site nanostructured catalysts using transition metals or metal oxides that have been developed in recent years. Experimental evidence is critically collected from the literature to provide the perspectives of morphology, valence, electronic structure, energy band, etc. The second part of this review summarizes different methods to synthesize hybrid structures with advanced carbon materials, which compensates for the poor electrical conductivity that most pure transition metal oxides lack. Different mechanisms for improved activity at hetero-atomic interfaces are compared and analyzed. Furthermore, reversible ORR/OER electrocatalyst durability requirements are discussed for industrial implementation of regenerative AEMFCs, and promising pathways for future catalyst design are proposed.									105	4	0	0	3	0	105			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000430057000019

Importantly, the spatial distribution of Ce species in the hosts can determine the availability of Ce species either as additives or as co-catalysts, which would dictate their different contributions to the enhanced electrocatalytic performance. Herein, the comprehensive investigations on two different catalyst configurations, namely CeO2-embedded NiO (Ce-NiO-E) and CeO2-surface-loaded NiO (Ce-NiO-L), are performed to understand the effect of their specific spatial arrangements on OER characteristics. The Ce-NiO-E catalysts exhibit a smaller overpotential of 382 mV for 10 mA cm(-2) and a lower Tafel slope of 118.7 mV dec(-1), demonstrating the benefits of the embedded configuration for OER, as compared with those of Ce-NiO-L (426 mV and 131.6 mV dec(-1)) and pure NiO (467 mV and 140.7 mV dec(-1)), respectively. The improved OER property of Ce-NiO-E originates from embedding small-sized CeO2 clusters into the host for the larger specific surface area, richer surface defects, higher oxygen adsorption capacity, and better optimized electronic structures of the surface active sites, as compared with Ce-NiO-L. Above findings provide a valuable guideline for and insight in designing catalysts with different spatial configurations for enhanced catalytic properties.									111	12	0	0	1	0	113			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000427110100023

Herein, NiCo2O4 nanowhiskers embedded into biomass-derived porous carbon (NCO@HHPC) is proposed and fabricated by a facile one-step hydrothermal strategy. In this composite, NiCo2O4 nanowhiskers shows low degree of crystallinity, providing rich ORR and OER catalytic active sites. The conductive carbon framework shows hierarchically porous microstructure, acting as host for anchoring NiCo2O4 nanowhiskers, improving the electronic conductivity and supplying fast transport channels for 02 diffusion and electrolyte infiltration. With optimized composition, the NCO@HHPC-0.5 (containing 0.5 mmol Co(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O in pre-cursor) exhibits an excellent bifunctional activity toward ORR and OER. Notably, the corresponding bifunctional activity parameter (Delta E) is as low as 0.78 V, outperforming most state-of-the-art reported nonprecious bifunctional electrocatalysts.

In this study, by anodic galvanostatic treatment in (NH4)(2) Fe(SO4)(2) solution, the amorphous Ni(OH)(2) (am-Ni(OH)(2)) is transformed into a short-range ordered Fe substituted-Ni(OH)(2) (so-Fe-Ni (OH)(2)), which contains abundant electroactive edge/corner sites. To further enhance surface area, the special tube-in-tube arrays (TTAs) are fabricated for so-Fe-Ni(OH)(2) to accelerate the reaction kinetics of OER. From DFT calculation, the low-coordinated defect sites with Fe-Ni-Fe units caused by the short-range ordered structure of so-Fe-Ni(OH)(2) TTAs facilitate the formation of adsorbed oxygen, which is rate-determining step for efficient OER. The so-Fe-Ni(OH)(2) TTAs show higher OER performance than long-range ordered Fe substituted-Ni(OH)(2) (lo-Fe-Ni(OH)(2)). This study will provide a new strategy for electroactive edge/corner-site engineering of hydroxidebased electrocatalysts for efficient OER.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000701827100002

Understanding the origins of oxygenic photosynthesis and Cyanobacteria is key when piecing together the events around Earth's oxygenation. It is likely that photosynthesis evolved within bacterial lineages that are not extant, so it can be challenging when studying the early history of photosynthesis. Recent genomic and molecular evolution studies have transformed our understanding about the evolution of photosynthetic reaction centres and the evolution of Cyanobacteria.

Here, a Cu2Se with fluffy intersected-nanosheets decorating nanotubes structure were prepared by a simple and rapid solution-immersion method at room temperature. The hollow hierarchical structure on a good conductor Cu foam (CF) enlarges surface available sites, enhances the conductivity of electrode materials, then endowing the catalyst with quick charge/mass transportation and favorable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. In alkaline medium, our as-prepared Cu2Se/CF electrode demonstrates high OER performance, especially for lower overpotential (200 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) compared with the previously reported Cu-based catalysts. Moreover, the Cu2Se catalyst could afford galvanostatic test of 10 mA cm(-2) test over 12 h and present superior OER tolerance. These results indicate that the Cu2Se catalyst via cost efficiency and efficient solution-immersion method could be applied to large-scale efficient OER. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

However, the energy conversion efficiency was largely restricted by the sluggish kinetics and the high cost of the catalysts. In this regard, developing non-precious metal materials as low-cost, highly efficient, and durable catalysts is extremely urgent topic. In this work, Mn doping of cobalt oxynitride (Co1-xMnxON) coupled with nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) nanosheets hybrids was created as a bifunctional and highly efficient catalyst toward the ORR and OER. The electrochemical tests indicated that the catalytic performance for the CoMnON/N-rGO has been greatly improved after Mn and N doping. For ORR, the onset potential and half-wave potential are 0.91 V and 0.83 V, respectively. Meanwhile, it manifests a low overpotential of 350 mV at 10 mAcm(-2), Tafel slope of 70 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH solution towards OER. The charge transfer rate and specific surface area for the hybrid catalyst dramatically increase with the incorporation of Mn and N. Our work provides a new strategy for developing highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The electrode is obtained via electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO) on a Ti substrate followed by thermal decomposition to prepare RuO2. According to results from SEM, CA curves, and EIS impedance, Ti/rGO-RuO2 has many exposed active sites and good electrical conductivity. Ti/rGO-RuO2 also shows excellent electrocatalytic performance for electrochemical water splitting (hydrogen evolution potential is -1.226 V and oxygen evolution potential is 0.842 V). After 10 h of electrolysis at 250 mA.cm(-2), the activity of Ti/rGO-RuO2 showed no significant decrease for the hydrogen evolution reaction. In sum, Ti/rGO-RuO2 contains an intermediate layer of graphene, has excellent application prospects in electrochemical water splitting, and has good application value in the field of hydroelectricity.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1452-3981			WOS:000441821400051		
J	Lee, Woonghee; Kim, Seok; Cho, Kangwoo					Cho, Kangwoo/0000-0002-1819-7687			Quantitative Evaluations on Ozone Evolution Electrocatalysts by Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy for Oxidative Water Treatment								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY											10.1021/acs.est.2c05290		OCT 2022			2022	This study valorized scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) for the detection of dissolved O3, which is increasingly in demand for water treatment. Au ultramicroelectr-odes biased at 0.62 V RHE provided superior activity and selectivity for O3 reduction, compared to Pt analogues. It allowed quantitative in situ interrogation of ozone evolution reaction (OZER) electrocatalysts with unprecedented estimations on the OZER overpotential. The difference in onset potentials between the OZER and the competing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) primarily accounted for the OZER current efficiency (CE) on boron-doped diamond (BDD, 1.4% at 10 mA cm-2 in 0.5 M H2SO4), Ni-Sb-doped SnO2 (NSS, 10.8%), and SiOx-coated NSS (NSS/SiOx, 34.4%). SECM areal scans in tandem with elemental mapping perspicuously visualized the improved OZER activity by the SiOx overlayer on NSS. A shift in the charge transfer coefficient further rationalized the elevated OZER selectivity on NSS/SiOx, in association with the weakened Sn-O bond strength confirmed by valence band X-ray photoelectron spectra. The invigorated OZER on NSS/SiOx effectively accelerated the degradation of a model aqueous pollutant (4-chlorophenol).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000874706900001	36245147

Herein, CoNiSe2 heteronanorods decorated with layered-double-hydroxides (LDHs) nanosheets are designed, in which the selenide-LDHs interfaces can boost H2O chemisorption to produce reactive H intermediate, resulting in fast HER kinetics. Such promotion in HER is further interpreted by theoretical calculation and in-situ Raman investigation. By contrast, it's negligible for anodic oxygen evolution. Assembled as an electrolyzer for overall water splitting, the heteronanorods afford a quite low cell voltage of 1.44 V at a geometric current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and remarkable stability for more than 48 h in 1.0 M KOH, performing among the best of non-precious electrocatalysts. Identifying efficient electrocatalysis on engineered heterointerfaces, this work is anticipated to open up new opportunities for catalyst design in energy chemistry.									143	8	0	0	6	0	144			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000450135000015

However, the electrocatalytic water splitting is greatly limited by the high over-potentials of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Especially, OER involves a complex multistep proton-coupled electron transfer process, which demands a high overpotential to accelerate this sluggish oxygen evolution kinetics. The high overpotentials for OER significantly decrease the efficiency of the overall water splitting. The OER half reaction has thus become the bottleneck of electrocatalytic overall water splitting. It is vital to synthesize highly active electrocatalysts to reduce the activation energy of the reaction and accelerate the generation of H-2 and O-2, thereby improving the efficiency of the overall water splitting. Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are representative cyanide-based coordination polymer materials. PBAs possess open framework structures, large specific surface areas, adjustable metal active sites and uniform catalytic centers, showing promising application in electrocatalytic water splitting. Besides, benefiting from the unique structural features of PBAs, their derived electrocatalysts also have large specific surface areas and uniform active sites. Moreover, PBAs can serve as carbon and nitrogen sources. The doped N can regulate the electronic structure of surface active sites, enhancing the intrinsic activity of electrocatalysts. Therefore, the PBA-derived electrocatalysts also exhibit good catalytic performance for water splitting. In this review, we not only summarize the most recent advances on PBAs and their derivatives as electrocatalysts for water splitting, but also conclude the core scientific challenges faced in water splitting. Finally, we provide perspectives for the future research in this field, including catalyst design, catalytic system establishment and so on. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Attention was focused on the state of the electrode surfaces, the influence of additives on the forms of chemisorbed oxygen, and on modifying effects in electrosynthesis. New electrolytes and ways to accelerate the electrochemical production of sodium perborate were suggested. Principles of selectivity control in anodic reactions were formulated.

However, most heterostructures via asynchronous heterophase synthesis suffer from the limited synergistic effect because of the sparse c-a interfaces. Here, a highly efficient and stable OER electrocatalyst with dense c-a interfacial sites is reported by hybridizing crystalline Ag and amorphous NiCoMo oxides (NCMO) on the nickel foam (NF) via synchronous dual-phase synthetic strategy. In 1 m KOH, the as-obtained Ag/NCMO/NF catalyst exhibits a low OER overpotential of 243 mV to attain 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 67 mV dec(-1). Theoretical calculations indicate that the c-a interface can efficiently modulate the electronic structure of the interfacial sites and lower the OER overpotential. Besides, in situ Raman spectroscopy results demonstrate that the c-a interfacial sites can promote the irreversible phase transition to the metal oxy(hydroxide) active phase, and the dense c-a interfaces can stabilize the active phase during the whole OER process.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000714601500001

Printable photocatalyst sheets, composed of a hydrogen evolution photocatalyst (HEP), an oxygen evolution photocatalyst (OEP), and conductive metal nanoparticles, are cost-effective and scalable systems. However, the decrease in water splitting activity under ambient pressure due to reverse reactions hampers their practical application. In this study, coating zirconium oxide (ZrOx) by facile drop-casting onto a printed photocatalyst sheet, which consists of SrTiO3 : Rh, BiVO4 : Mo, and Au nanocolloids as the HEP, OEP, and electron mediator, respectively, effectively maintains the water splitting activity at elevated pressure. The ZrOx-coated photocatalyst sheet retains 90 % and 84 % of the base performance (the pristine sheet at 10 kPa) at 50 and 90 kPa, respectively. Achieving efficient water splitting at the ambient pressure by inexpensive and extensible processes is an important step toward solar hydrogen production.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000558838400001	32697877

However, reducing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential is critical to the overall process efficiency and economic feasibility. To this end, we demonstrate novel 3D hierarchical alpha-Ni(OH)(2) nanoparticle decorated stainless steel nanoparticle (SSNP) catalyst deposits on Ni foam substrates. SSNP deposition along with simultaneous in situ Ni(OH)(2) decoration of the SSNP is facilitated via a facile single-step electrophoretic deposition (EPD) based co-deposition method. The enhanced OER catalytic activity of alpha-Ni(OH)(2) owing to the synergistic SSNP support, which possibly serves as a dopant source to the metal hydroxide, could sustain current densities of 10 and 125 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 220 and 250 mV respectively, in 1 M KOH. These robust deposits could survive accelerated cycling and prolonged oxygen generation at higher current densities despite the lack of any polymeric binders. In 10 M KOH, a current density of 500 mA cm(-2) could be maintained at an overpotential of 450 mV (iR-uncorrected).									17	0	0	0	1	0	17				2052-1537		WOS:000413892500022

Using density functional theory, we extensively investigate and quantitatively model the mechanism and energetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the (001) facets of their inverse-spinel structure, thought as the most abundant orientations under reaction conditions. We catalogue a wide set of intermediates and mechanistic pathways, including the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) and adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), along with critical (rate-determining) O-O bond formation barriers and transition-state structures. In the case of NiFe2O4, we predict a Fe- site-assisted LOM pathway as the preferred OER mechanism, with a barrier (Delta G double dagger) of 0.84 eV at U = 1.63 V versus SHE and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.26 s(-1) at 0.40 V overpotential. In the case of CoFe2O4, we find that a Fe-site-assisted LOM pathway (Delta G double dagger = 0.79 eV at U = 1.63 V vs SHE, TOF = 1.81 s(-1) at 0.40 V overpotential) and a Co-site-assisted AEM pathway (Delta G double dagger = 0.79 eV at bias > U = 1.34 V vs SHE, TOF = 1.81 s(-1) at bias >1.34 V) could both play a role, suggesting a coexistence of active sites, in keeping with experimental observations. The computationally predicted turnover frequencies exhibit a fair agreement with experimentally reported data and suggest CoFe2O4 as a more promising OER catalyst than NiFe2O4 in the pristine case, especially for the Co-site-assisted OER pathway, and may offer a basis for further progress and optimization.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2155-5435			WOS:000861750300001	35966604

Here, we reported the synthesis of NiFe layered double hydroxide/reduced graphene oxide (NiFe-LDH/rGO) nanohybrid via the facile solvothermal method followed by chemical reduction. The template role of surfactant and the hybridization of rGO supplied the NiFe-LDH/rGO catalyst with a porous nanostructure and an enhanced conductivity, favoring both mass transport and charge communication of electrocatalytic reactions. The NiFe-LDH/rGO composite not only displayed highly efficient OER activity in alkaline solution with a low onset overpotential of 240 mV, but also only needed an overpotential of 250 mV to reach the 10 mA cm(-2) current density. The NiFe-LDH/rGO nanohybrid also offered excellent ORR catalytic activity with onset potential at 0.796 V in alkaline media. The rotating disk and rotating-ring-disk electrodes both revealed that the ORR on NiFe-LDH/rGO mainly involved a direct four-electron reaction pathways accompanying part of the two-electron process. The excellent bifunctional activity of the NiFe-LDH/rGO nanohybrid could be attributed to the synergistic effects of rGO and NiFe-LDH components due to the strongly coupled interactions.

Herein, in situ-formed cobalt phosphate decorated with N-doped graphitic carbon was prepared using phosphonate-based metal organic frameworks (MOFs) as the precursor. It can serve as a highly active OER catalyst in alkaline media, affording a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of 215 mV on the Ni foam. A combination of X-ray absorption spectroscopy and high-resolution XPS elucidates the origin of the high activity. Our observations unveil that cobalt diphosphate having the distorted metal coordination geometry with long Co-O and Co-Co distances is mainly responsible for the high OER activity. These results not only demonstrate the potential of a low-cost OER catalyst derived from phosphonate-based MOF but also open a promising avenue into the exploration of highly active and stable catalysts toward replacing noble metals as oxygen evolution electrocatalysts.									130	9	0	0	5	0	132			2155-5435			WOS:000410005700049

Graphene sheets adsorbed with tetracyanoethylene (TONE) molecules were studied using first-principles calculations to predict their catalytic activities for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in fuel cells and metal air batteries. The electronic structures and reaction free energies were calculated to analyze effect of electron transfer between graphene and TONE on the catalytic mechanisms of the graphene. Stone Wales defects and edges were also introduced into the models to understand their role in catalysis. The results show that TCNE-adsorbed graphene has a lower limit of overpotentials of 0.425 V for OER and ORR, comparable to that of noble metals and S-doped graphene. The most active sites locate at the edges of the graphene. Stone Wales defects enhance the catalytic activities on graphene nanoribbons. Our calculations predict that TONE-adsorbed graphene could be an efficient metal-free catalyst for ORR and OER.									34	3	0	0	2	0	34			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000369772900017

In this paper, La-doped and Ce-doped CoFe LDH was prepared to enhance OER. Experiments show that the OER performance with 25%La-CoFe LDH and 25%Ce-CoFe LDH is better than CoFe LDH. And the oxygen evolution potential of 25%La-CoFe LDH at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 is 1.547 V, which is far lower than CoFe LDH(1.694 V). And it also has lower Tafel slope(125 mV/dec), larger electrochemical specific surface area(2.46mF/cm2) and lower charge transfer resistance(37.5 omega). Through a series of characterization test analysis, it can be concluded that after La3+ or Ce3+ partially replaces Fe3+, the CoFe LDH system has more defects. This may be due to the fact that the ionic radius of La3+ and Ce3+ is much larger than that of Fe3+, and La3+ and Ce3+ have unique electronic structures. The partial replacement of Fe3+ will affect the electronic structure of CoFe LDH, thereby enhancing the electronic coordination in the system, thereby exhibiting excellent OER performance.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000672811600002

The impacts of pH and reaction temperature on the electrocatalytic and photocatalytic OER kinetics were investigated. For electrocatalysis, a NiFeOx catalyst was hydrothermally decorated on Ni foam. In 1 M KOH solution, the NiFeOx electrocatalyst achieved 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 260 mV. The same catalyst was decorated on the surface of Ta3N5 photocatalyst powder. The reaction was conducted in the presence of 0.1 M Na2S2O8 as a strong electron scavenger, thus likely leading to the OER being kinetically relevant. When compared with the bare Ta3N5, NiFeOx/Ta3N5 demonstrated a 5-fold improvement in photocatalytic activity in the OER under visible light irradiation, achieving a quantum efficiency of 24% at 480 nm. Under the conditions investigated, a strong correlation between the electrocatalytic and photocatalytic performances was identified: an improvement in electrocatalysis corresponded with an improvement in photocatalysis without altering the identity of the materials. The rate change, at different pH was likely associated with electrocatalytic kinetics that accordingly influenced the photocatalytic rates. The sensitivity of the reaction rates with respect to the reaction temperature resulted in an apparent activation energy of 25 kJ mol(-1) in electrocatalysis, whereas the apparent activation energy in photocatalysis was 16 kJ mol(-1). The origin of the difference in these activation energy values is likely attributed to the possible effects of temperature on the individual thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of the reaction process. The work described herein demonstrates a method of "transferring the knowledge of electrocatalysis to photocatalysis" as a strong tool to rationally and quantitatively understand the complex reaction schemes involved in photocatalytic reactions.									104	1	0	0	7	0	104			2155-5435			WOS:000371755500039

The special electronic and mechanical properties of GDY offer a good platform for electronic modification, activate the high electroactivity of modified GDY. Based on that, several approaches have been proposed to modify the electronic structure of GDY, including heteroatoms doping, anchoring single metal atoms, stacking configuration control, and strain engineering. With these modification techniques, the electronic structure, bandgap, and Femi-level can be widely tuned. In addition, GDY plays a vital role in highly efficient single-atom catalysts. It can act as the ideal supporting substrate for isolated single atoms due to its outstanding electrochemical properties. Meanwhile, the latest research is found that the modified GDY can be used as the high-performance oxygen reduction reactions, oxygen evolution reactions, hydrogen evolution reactions and nitrogen reduction reactions electrocatalysts. The summary of GDY electronic modification and its application also reveals that GDY-based materials have a bright future in the field of electrochemical catalysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2053-1583			WOS:000696086400001

Emerging anion-redox chemistry provides exciting opportunities for boosting catalytic activity, and thus mastering lattice-oxygen activation of metal oxides and identifying the origins are crucial for the development of advanced catalysts. Here, a strategy to activate surface lattice-oxygen sites for OER catalysis via constructing a Ruddlesden-Popper/perovskite hybrid, which is prepared by a facile one-pot self-assembly method, is developed. As a proof-of-concept, the unique hybrid catalyst (RP/P-LSCF) consists of a dominated Ruddlesden-Popper phase LaSr3Co1.5Fe1.5O10-delta (RP-LSCF) and second perovskite phase La0.25Sr0.75Co0.5Fe0.5O3-delta (P-LSCF), displaying exceptional OER activity. The RP/P-LSCF achieves 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of only 324 mV in 0.1 m KOH, surpassing the benchmark RuO2 and various state-of-the-art metal oxides ever reported for OER, while showing significantly higher activity and stability than single RP-LSCF oxide. The high catalytic performance for RP/P-LSCF is attributed to the strong metal-oxygen covalency and high oxygen-ion diffusion rate resulting from the phase mixture, which likely triggers the surface lattice-oxygen activation to participate in OER. The success of Ruddlesden-Popper/perovskite hybrid construction creates a new direction to design advanced catalysts for various energy applications.									48	2	0	0	2	0	47			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000527074000001	32309914

Water electrolysis is one of the most promising ways to generate hydrogen, but the rather high energy required seriously hinders its widespread applications yet. In this study, we report an alkaline electrolyzer to implement energy-saving H-2 generation by coupling cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with anodic glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) other than oxygen evolution reaction, in which nickel-doped MoS2 nanoparticles (Ni-MoS2 NPs) has been developed as bifunctional electrocatalyst for HER and GOR. The electrolyzer only requires a cell voltage of 1.67 V to reach an electrolysis current density of 10 mA cm(-2), about 270 mV lower than the corresponding value in the traditional electrolyzer. Electrolytic H-2 generation with the assistance of biomass derived materials may open a new way for the future sustainable development. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Thus, RuO2 has been demonstrated as a benchmark electrocatalyst for the anodic reaction of water splitting, especially in an acidic electrolyte. Nevertheless, there is still much room to promote the OER catalytic activity and the operational stability of RuO2 to fulfill the requirements of practical applications. Optimizing the composition of RuO2 by a simple doping strategy can be considerably beneficial, with enhanced catalytic activity and excellent stability achieved simultaneously. This review presents the recent progress in doped ruthenium oxides as high-efficiency electrocatalysts for the OER, with various types of dopants and design strategies summarized as well. Maps of OER performance outcomes, including activity and stability, are presented to demonstrate the advantages of doping and to compare the different effects of various introduced metal elements. Special attention is paid to a clearer understanding of triggering reaction mechanisms by a series of characterizations. The remaining challenges and future research directions are also proposed.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000670019400001

Herein, we report a Co-based nanocubes (NBs) containing an low amount of ruthenium oxide RuO2/Co3O4 as an efficient electrocatalyst synthesized via a facile ion impregnation and calcine approach with Co-3(Co(CN)(6)) precursor. Owing to the close combination between Ru ions and Co-3(Co(CN)(6)), the good dispersion and small size of RuO2 nanoparticle can be achieved on the surface of Co3O4 nanotubes after calcination, suggesting the more active sites and better utilization of RuO2. The synergistic effect of RuO2/Co3O4 hybrid can provide the faster charge transfer process and the structural stability. The as-synthesized RuO2/Co3O4 NBs show the promising electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with lower overpotential (302 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2)) and higher current density than state of the commercial RuO2 samples. The long-term stability of RuO2/Co3O4 NBs is obtained. Therefore, designing the ions impregnation into precursor may present a facile strategy for cost-effective electrocatalysts for OER.

In contrast to proton-exchange-membrane (PEM) technology, which requires precious-metal oxide anodes, AEM systems allow for the use of earth-abundant anode catalysts. Here we report a study of first-row transition-metal (oxy)hydroxide/oxide catalyst powders for application in AEM devices and compare physical properties and performance to benchmark IrOx catalysts as well as typical catalysts for alkaline electrolyzers. We show that the catalysts' oxygen-evolution activity measured in alkaline electrolyte using a typical three-electrode cell is a poor indicator of performance in the AEM system. The best oxygen-evolution-reaction (OER) catalysts in alkaline electrolyte, NiFeOxHy oxyhydroxides, are the worst in AEM electrolysis devices where a solid alkaline electrolyte is used along with a pure water feed. NiCoOx-based catalysts show the best performance in AEM electrolysis. The performance can be further improved by adding Fe species to the particle surface. We attribute the differences in performance in part to differences in the electrical conductivity of the catalyst phases, which are also measured and reported.									98	5	0	0	3	0	98			2155-5435			WOS:000455286600002

Taking advantage of the synergy of Fe(OH)(3) and NiNH, the optimized Fe(OH)(3)@NiNH/NF sample shows a very promising electrocatalytic OER activity in 1 M KOH solution, requiring a very low overpotential of 212 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) to deliver a geometrical catalytic current density of 100 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1).

The self-assembly of the threefold and sixfold-symmetric terpyridines (tpy) with Co(II) salts results in a novel morphological and structural characteristics, regardless of the nature of the self-assembled fragments. Herein, such metallopolymers are achieved by one-pot synthesis in CH3OH/CHCl3(v/v = 5:1) mixture ambient. It is found, for the first time, that Co-containing polymers can be well dispersed in deionized water to form gel-like self-assemblies that consist of a highly interconnected 3D network and exhibit enhanced electrical conductivity and thus are attractive as electrocatalysts. As expected, the optimized Co-based polymeric structures exhibit a low overpotential of 320 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)and high stability over 2000 cycles toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), surpassing commercial RuO2/C, single-site Co catalysts, polymer, and metal-organic framework-based OER catalysts reported to date. X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that the tpy-Co2+(3N-Co or tpy-Co2+) configurations act as highly active sites. Importantly, this work demonstrates the functional application of the self-assembled metallopolymers as electrocatalysts for energy conversion.									20	3	0	0	1	0	20			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000555441500001

The essential ingredients of this approach consists of (1) co-electrodeposition of Ru, Ti and Zn as metallic alloy and subsequent annealing to oxide (2) dissolution under electrochemically oxidative acidic environment of Ru and Zn-rich surface clusters having high selectivity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) leaving Ti-enriched structure that is more selective to CER and (3) using this electrocatalyst for KClO3 production under near-neutral pH conditions. Dissolution of Ru- and Zn enriched surfaces result in higher porosity and surface roughness. Furthermore, this electrochemical dissolution of (Zn, Ru)-rich surface results in electrocatalytic structure that is self-selective towards KClO3 formation with higher specific activity.

In this paper, we have evaluated the catalytic mechanism and activity of doped hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) surfaces as cathode catalysts for nonaqueous Li-O-2 batteries. From the free energy diagrams it is evident that the CN doped h-BN surface shows the best catalytic activity among the others and this arises due to its considerably lower oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) overpotential and lower oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential. This is due to the weaker binding of the first product (LiO2) and stronger binding with the inserted Li atom. The computations predict that among the considered doped h-BN surfaces, the CN doped h-BN surface can be an efficient metal-free cathode material for nonaqueous Li-O-2 batteries.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000436032900019	29882942

In this work, a novel and facile MOF-mediated synthesis strategy is demonstrated for constructing efficient OER catalysts. The nickelocene molecules were introduced into the channels of 2-D layered MOF (Co-BDC) to form the nickelocene@Co-BDC hybrids by vapor deposition method. The Ni-Co@carbon nanosheet was obtained by direct carbonization of nickelocene@Co-BDC. The obtained bimetallic electrocatalyst exhibits an unprecedentedly high OER activity with a small overpotential (243 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) and a low Tafel slop (66.97 mVdec(-1)) in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution, which is better than the most reported non-noble metal based electrocatalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) studies reveal that the synergetic effect of Ni and Co active sites affords superior electrocatalytic properties, further indicating this binary metal electrocatalyst is a promising candidate for sustainable energy applications.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000618307300001

Specifically, theinsightful studies reveal that the amorphous NiOOH in situ formedon the surface of heterostructure electrocatalyst during OER(NiOOH@Ag/Ni3S2/NF) is regarded as the real active species.This self-constructed electrode only needs low overpotentials of183, 195, and 263 mV at the current density of 10, 20, and 100 mAcm-2, respectively, as well as a low Tafel slope of 37 mV dec-1in 1M KOH, and is maintained for 500 h almost without anydegradation at a high current density of 100 mA cm-2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the synergisticeffects among multiple components can effectively boost the intrinsic OER activity via increasing conductivity and optimizingbinding energy of oxygen-contained intermediates, and the enhanced Ni-O bonding accounts for the superior durability. This workprovides deep insight into the key role of Ag on boosting both the catalytic activity and the stability of nickel sulfides toward OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-0485			WOS:000800521700028

Herein, we report that a large number of in-plane active sites can be generated by confining high density of 16 wt% molybdenum single atoms in the basal-plane lattice of CoOOH (Mo-CoOOH). By constructing robust three-dimensional (3D) nanoframes to prevent layer-stacking and maximize exposure of active basal planes, the catalyst achieves an unprecedented OER activity at a large current density of 2000 mA cm(-2), exhibiting the lowest overpotential of 400 mV among all previously reported catalysts with a high durability of over 120 hours. Multiple spectrometry characterization studies and first-principles calculations reveal that lattice-confined Mo atoms can bond moderately with OER intermediates, thereby serving as active sites for the reaction. This strategy provides a new path to design high-performance MOOH electrocatalysts with rich in-plane active sites.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000765465500001

Herein, we developed IrP2 nanocrystals uniformly anchored in P,N-codoped carbon nanosheets (IrP2@PNC-NS) as highly active OER electrocatalysts. The ultrathin PNC-NS reconstructs an agaric-like porous structure, which can inhibit the agglomeration of the IrP2 nanocrystals effectively. Moreover, the in-situ phosphatization leads to the formation of a strong electron interaction between PNC-NS and IrP2 nanocrystals, endowing the heterostructure materials with satisfying synergistic effects. Benefiting from the collaborative advantages of ideal configuration structure and favorable synergistic effects, IrP2@PNC-NS exhibits excellent OER performance with a low overpotential of 221 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and a small Tafel slope of 37.5 mV dec(-1).

The samples were mostly in layered double hydroxide at the initial temperature, but upon heat treatment, they were converted to NiFe2O4 phases. The electrochemical behaviour of the different samples was studied by linear sweep voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry on the glassy carbon electrode. The OER catalyst activity was observed for low mass loadings (0.125 mg cm(-2)), whereas high catalyst loading exhibited the best performance on the ORR side. The sample heat-treated at 250 degrees C delivered the highest bi-functional oxygen evolution and reduction reaction activity (OER/ORR) thanks to its thin-holey nanosheet-like structure with higher nickel oxidation state at 250 degrees C. This work further helps to develop low-cost electrocatalyst development for metal-air batteries.									20	1	0	0	1	0	21				2073-4344		WOS:000442517100033

Design of a new class of low-cost and highly efficient electrocatalysts for the water-oxygen redox cycle (WORC) system including OER and ORR is considered a huge challenge. Controlled synthesis of unique and stable precursors as a perfect platform to synthesize target products with diverse compositions are of vital importance. Herein, we synthesized a metal/metal carbide-based composite (denoted as Co-Mo-C/NRGO-1) by directly carbonizing Co-doped polyoxometalate/conductive polymer/graphene precursor (Co-PCG) as an efficient bi-functional electrocatalyst. The resulting Co-Mo-C/NRGO-1 composite exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity for OER with an ultra-low Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1), a small overpotential of 330 mV vs. RHE at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and long-term stability in alkaline medium. The ORR performance was also investigated with a positive onset potential (similar to -95 mV vs. Ag/AgCl), remarkable stability over 30 000 s and good tolerance to methanol crossover. Most importantly, the OER performance of Co-Mo-C/NRGO-1 was the best among all the reported carbide-based materials and was comparable to the best OER electrodes.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000388505400024

Here, on the basis of operando x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, we probe the in situ activation of Br-confined conductive Ni-based metal-organic framework (Br-Ni-MOF) hollow prisms toward an active oxygen electrocatalyst during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process. The successive structural transformations from pristine Br-Ni-MOF to a beta-Ni(OH)(2) analog then subsequently to a gamma-NiOOH phase during OER are observed. This post-formed gamma-NiOOH analog manifests high OER performance with a superior overpotential of 306 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a high turnover frequency value of 0.051 s(-1) at an overpotential of 300 mV, making Br-Ni-MOF one of the most active oxygen electrocatalysts reported. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the strong electronic coupling between Br and Ni atoms accelerates the generation of the key *O intermediate toward fast OER kinetics.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			2375-2548			WOS:000717666900019	34757786

However, the best electrocatalysts for these processes-which include the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and the redox reactions that enable regenerative liquid-junction photoelectrochemical solar cells-often contain scarce and expensive noble metals, substantially limiting the potential for these technologies to compete with fossil fuels. The considerable challenge is to develop robust electrocatalysts composed exclusively of low-cost, earth-abundant elements that exhibit activity comparable to that of the noble metals. In this review, we summarize recent progress in the development of such high-performance earth-abundant inorganic electrocatalysts (and nanostructures thereof), classifying these materials based on their elemental constituents. We then detail the most critical obstacles facing earth-abundant inorganic electrocatalysts and discuss various strategies for further improving their performance. Lastly, we offer our perspectives on the current directions of earth-abundant inorganic electrocatalyst development and suggest pathways toward achieving performance competitive with their noble metal-containing counterparts.									968	57	0	0	41	1	975			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000343974700004

However, the influence of metal decoration on the electrolysis of the reverse reaction of ORR, that is, oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is seldom reported. Moreover, further improving the bifunctional activity and corrosion tolerance for carbon-based materials remains a big challenge, especially in OER potential regions. Here, bimetal-decorated, pyridinic N-dominated large-size carbon tubes (MM'-N/C) are proposed for the first time as highly efficient and durable ORR and OER catalysts. FeFe-N/C, CoCo-N/C, NiNi-N/C, MnMn-N/C, FeCo-N/C, NiFe-N/C, FeMn-N/C, CoNi-N/C, MnCo-N/C, and NiMn-N/C are systematically investigated in terms of their structure, composition, morphology, surface area, and active site densities. In contrast to conventional monometal and N-decorated carbon, small amounts of bimetal (approximate to 2 at%) added during the one-step template-free synthesis contribute to increased pyridinic N content, much longer and more robust carbon tubes, reduced metal particle size, and stronger coupling between the encapsulated metals and carbon support. The synergy of those factors accounts for the dramatically improved ORR and OER activity and stability. By comparison, NiFe-N/C and MnCo-N/C stand out and achieve superior bifunctional oxygen catalytic performance, exceeding most of state-of-the-art catalysts.									143	8	0	0	2	0	143			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000399455900013	28199051

However, in many cases, the synthesis of phosphide-based nanostructures requires expensive conditions and toxic phosphorous-containing compounds. Therefore, the emergence of an economical and eco-friendly method for creating phosphides-based nanostructures can be very effective. Here, S-doped Ni-P nanospheres were created using a novel pulse electrochemical deposition method, and its hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as well as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic activity and stability were investigated. Inspired by the high electrochemically active surface area, the synergistic effect between S and P, the rapid detachment of the gasses from the surface and thus the lowered resistance resulted from bubbles pinning, and ultimately the increased wettability due to nanostructuring, the electrode exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic activity for HER and OER processes. The electrode requires only 55 mV and 229 mV overproduction to be able to afford the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) for HER and OER processes, respectively. Furthermore, at a current density of 100 mA.cm(-2), these electrodes showed minor changes in potential, indicating the superb electrocatalytic stability of the synthesized electrode. Moreover, in the overall water splitting process, the S-doped Ni-P electrode requires only 1.51 V to generate a current of 10 mA. cm(-2). The results of this study indicate the successful use of pulse electrochemical deposition method to create active electrocatalysts. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Numerous examples of strain engineering have been applied to various electrocatalysts for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but strain-optimized 2D carbon-based single-atom electrocatalysts for catalyzing the overall water splitting reaction have received little attention. Here, we applied the lattice strain of Co,N co-decorated graphyne (Co@N-1-GY) to directly optimize its catalytic activity for the overall water splitting reaction based on first-principles calculations. Our calculations suggest that compressive strain and tensile strain lead to less stability of Co@N-1-GY and the distances between C and Co atoms increase linearly with the strain changing from compressive to tensile, thus linearly upshifting the p-band center of C atoms and the d-band center of Co atoms. In addition, biaxial strain has more remarkable effects on these properties than uniaxial strain. From compressive to tensile strain, the chemisorption of electrochemically generated intermediates in both HER and OER becomes weaker and weaker. A tensile strain of 0.5% on Co@N-1-GY gives an ideal HER performance, while the OER reaches the minimum overpotential of 0.33 V under the biaxial tensile strain of 3%.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000510729400064	31939963

However, advanced catalytic materials for key NO3--to-NH4+ and OH--to-O-2 reactions are rather rare. Herein, first principle calculations are performed to pre-screen target catalysts and then the effective catalyst in the experiment is successfully prepared, with which, a high power density Zn-nitrate electrochemical cell is demonstrated. The cathode catalyst can promote both reductive NO3--to-NH4+ and oxidative OH--to-O-2 reactions in low-overpotential pathways, contributing to the total battery reaction: NO3- + 3H(2)O -> NH4+ + 2OH(-) + 2O(2). The resulting electrochemical cell shows over 90% NO3--to-NH4+ selectivity, a high power density over 25 mW cm(-2), and stable 35 h cycling at 12.5 mA cm(-2). Moreover, this Zn-nitrate electrochemical cell can work driven by the photovoltaic cell with the solar-to-NH3 efficiency up to 19.5%. This work demonstrates a theoretically screened catalyst realizing a photovoltaic driven high-rate Zn-nitrate electrochemical cell system, which mimics soybean system upgrading N species and producing oxygen.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000849587500001

The cyclization, dehydrogenation of linear PAN macromolecule chains, oxygen uptake reactions of linear PAN macromolecule chains and cyclic structures were discussed in detail through tracking quantitatively the evolution of some specific groups. The cyclization, dehydrogenation and oxygen uptake reactions were evolved synchronously at the initial stage of TOS processes, but dehydrogenation and oxygen uptake reactions became dominant as cyclization extent above 0.7. Based on the data from FTIR and curve-fitting, a new procedure was developed to calculate the formed cyclic structures.

Bifunctional performances of CoWO4 nano-cubes are explored for water electrolysis in an alkaline medium (1.0 M KOH) vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under various atmospheres (N-2, air and O-2). Low overpotential (eta(10) = 0.45 V) of CoWO4 nano-cubes is accomplished at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Tafel polarization curves (potential vs. log current density) reveal relatively lower slope values for OER (similar to 82 mV dec(-1)) and ORR (similar to 68 mV dec(-1)) compared to previous reports. Stability test of electrode materials has been performed using chrono-amperometry (CA) at fixed potential for 500 seconds. Kinetics and mobility of electrons have also been studied during the water redox reactions. Stable nature and enhanced bifunctional electro-catalytic performances of earth abundant CoWO4 electrodes could be used as the replacement of expensive electroactive noble electrode materials (Pt, Ir, Ru etc.) for water electrolysis (OER and ORR) in near future.									72	0	0	0	6	0	72				2046-2069		WOS:000412147000044

Recent studies on molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) nanosheets revealed that controlling the edge states and doping/modifying with suitable elements are highly important in tuning the catalytic activities of MoS2. Here we report a bulk, single step method to synthesize metal modified MoS2 quantum dots (QDs). Three elements, namely Fe, Mg and Li, are chosen to study the effects of dopants in the catalytic activities of MoS2. Fe and Mg are found to act like dopants in the MoS2 lattice forming respective doped MoS2 QDs, while Li formed an intercalated MoS2 QD. The efficacy and tunability of these luminescent doped QDs towards various electrocatalytic activities ( hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction action) are reported here.									14	1	1	0	2	0	15			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000377493700015	27231837

Besides the development of highly active catalysts, gas management during gas-involving electrochemical reactions is equally critical for industrial applications to achieve high reaction rates (hundreds of milliamperes per square centimeter) under practical operation voltages. Biomimetic surfaces, which generally show regular micro/nanostructures, offer new insights to address this issue because of their special wetting capabilities. Although a series of nanoarray-based structured electrodes have been constructed and demonstrated with excellent performances for gas-involving electrochemical reactions, understanding of bubble wetting behavior remains elusive. In this Account, our recent works including understanding the way to achieve the superwetting properties of solid electrode surfaces, and our advanced design and fabrication of superwetting electrodes for different types of electrochemical gas-involving electrochemical reactions are summarized.To begin, we first put forward several criteria of superwetting surfaces, including superaerophobic surfaces and superaerophilic surfaces. Then, we discuss how the nanoarray-based surface engineering technology can achieve the superwetting properties, in which high roughness of the nanoarray architecture is discovered to be a critical factor for constructing superaerophobic and superaerophilic surfaces. Finally, the feasibility of superwetting electrodes for enhancing the performances of gas-involving electrochemical reactions is also analyzed.Based on theoretical guidance, a series of superaerophobic and superaerophilic electrodes with various methods, such as hydrothermal reactions, electrodeposition technology and high-temperature vapor phase growth, have been built for practice. By comparing with the traditional planar electrodes fabricated by drop-casting method, the superaerophobic electrodes afford a low adhesion force to gas products and accelerate gas bubbles evolution, resulting in fast current increase and stable current for gas evolution reactions. This phenomenon is confirmed by operating different gas evolution reactions (hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution and hydrazine oxidation) using superaerophobic electrodes with different catalysts (e.g., MoS2, Pt and Cu). On the other side, the superaerophilic electrodes can improve the catalytic performance of gas consumption reaction (e.g., oxygen reduction reaction) by facilitating gas diffusion and electron transport.Following theoretical analyses and experimental demonstrations, we assemble several energy conversion systems (e.g., electrochemical water splitting and direct hydrazine fuel cells) based on superwetting electrodes and test their performances. By virtue of the structural advantages of electrodes, these energy conversion systems show much higher energy efficiencies than their counterparts. In the last section, we put forward several future fields which are worthy for further exploration as rational extensions of the superwetting electrodes.									248	26	0	0	14	0	251			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000439398000003	29883085

Herein, a novel strategy for ultrafast (20 s) transformation of bulk metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) into ultrathin metal oxyhydroxide nanosheets for efficient OER has been developed. For two isomeric MOFs (FJI-H25Fe and FJI-H25FeCo), only the metastable FJI-H25FeCo bulk can immediately transform into FeCo-oxyhydroxides nanosheets through electric-field assisted hydrolysis. The potential evolution process from MOF bulk to FeCo-oxyhydroxides nanosheets has been investigated in detail. The as-made nanosheets exhibit excellent OER performances, showing an extremely low overpotential of 231 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a relatively small Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1), and long-term durability of at least 30 h. This work not only provides a novel strategy for facile preparation of low-cost and efficient OER electrocatalysts, but also represents a new way for preparation of metal oxyhydroxides nanosheets with good crystallinity and morphology, and a fresh method for mild synthesis of nanosized derivatives from MOF materials.									55	3	0	0	0	0	56			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000535293900001	32356324

Transition metal borides are some of the most promising electrocatalysts for water splitting. Here, this work demonstrates that boron can promote the OER effect by regulating the interaction of reaction intermediates. Ternary transition metal borides can be prepared by in situ deposition on the surface of nickel foam through a simple chemical reduction method. Tungsten-iron-nickel-boron (W-Fe-Ni-B) nanoparticles show excellent OER activity and require an overpotential of 223 mV versus the RHE to reach 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 38.8 mV dec(-1). This catalyst experiences only a 6 mV shift after 12 hours of continuous testing in 1.0 M KOH solution, indicating good long-term stability. The combination of high catalytic activity, ease of preparation, and low cost makes WFeNiB/NF-based catalysts very promising OER catalysts. This high efficiency is mainly due to the catalyst's unique electronic structure, accelerated charge transfer, and hydro-hydro electronic surface. The significant stability is attributed to the increased corrosion resistance of borate species in the catalyst. The OER on the NiFeWB/NF surface involves metal adsorption and surface lattice oxygen. The metal elements acted as the active center, which triggered the OER together with lattice oxygen.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000750358200001

In this work, self-supported FeNi@FeNiB-700 has been developed by a facile and environment-friendly solid-phase boronizing process, and it exhibits excellent catalytic activity toward the OER. It requires overpotentials of 272 mV (eta(10)) and 399 mV (eta(100)) to deliver oxygen-evolution current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, outperforming many previously reported catalysts such as NiCo LDH nanosheets, Ni3S2/NF leaves, CoSe2 NS@CP, etc. The impressive electrocatalytic performance is attributed to the formation of loose and porous bi-metal borides on the surface of the electrode, which guarantees enhanced active surface area and rapid charge/mass transfer. Moreover, the optimum pair of porous Ni-P foam (cathode) || FeNi@FeNiB-700 (anode) in a two-electrode alkaline water electrolyzer also possesses high durability and only requires a cell voltage of 1.65 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2). This study allows for large-scale application of cheap and efficient 3D bi-metal boride electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction and overall water splitting.									42	1	0	0	2	0	42			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000482139000033

The effect of synthesis conditions, i.e., heating rate and calcination temperature, and the addition of minor amounts of iron were evaluated with respect to the OER activity. Moreover, the influence of the alkali cation type in the electrolyte (Li, Na, K) was also evaluated. The highest activity was found for the NiCo2O4 obtained with the lowest heating rate. The increase in the heating rate and calcination temperature results in the decrease of the available surface area for the reaction, leading to the deterioration of the activity. The incorporation of 3 wt% of iron in the lattice of NiCo2O4 and Co3O4 resulted in a decrease of the OER activity, however, the deactivation was much less severe in the case of NiCo2O4 than for Co3O4. Among the alkaline electrolytes used, KOH resulted in the highest catalytic activity both for NiCo2O4 and Co3O4. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this article, a Ni-Co-derived metal-organic framework (Ni-Co-MOF) is rapidly formed at ambient temperature, followed by a low-temperature sulfuration process to obtain Ni-Co-based sulfides couple with a nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S)-codoped carbon support with a porous structure (Ni-Co-S/NSC). The designed Ni-Co-S/NSC presents excellent electrocatalytic performances for OER (10 mA cm(-2) @309 mV) and ORR (0.81 V g E-1/2) and a small Delta E (Delta E = E-j10 - E-1/2) of 0.73 V in an alkaline electrolyte, enabling its use as an outstanding cathode in rechargeable Zn-air batteries. In situ Raman spectra demonstrated that metal hydroxides formed during OER endowed the obtained electrocatalyst with a predominant catalytic performance. Impressively, a homemade rechargeable Zn- air battery composed by this nanocomposite as the cathode delivered remarkable properties with a peak power density of 137 mW cm(-2) and a high specific capacity of 829 mAh g(-1).

Herein, an amorphous MnO2/lithiated NiO nanosheet array is grown directly on a highly conductive nickel foam substrate to use as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in iron molten air batteries. The advantages of the nanosheet array structure are having more highly exposed active sites for electrochemical reactions, as well as a conductive stable 3D framework for allowing barrier-free diffusion and transport of ions and oxygen gas. As a result, the amorphous MnO2/lithiated NiO nanosheet array exhibits a promising catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction with a voltage gap of only 0.29V. The as-assembled iron molten air battery shows an impressive rechargeability with the highest coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% through 200 cycles with an average discharge potential of approximate to 1.14V at 500 degrees C. Moreover, the cell has a high rate response up to 6.7C with a discharge voltage of above 0.9V. The study achieves critical advances for iron molten air batteries without the use of precious metals in contrast with previous results using the Pd-based catalyst.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000471344300021

Herein, a novel strategy is demonstrated to integrate atomic vacancies onto a twinned Pd2CoAg surface. This strategy shows that such integration is highly efficient for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysis at room temperature. We characterize the composition and structure of the twinned Pd2CoAg nanocrystals with vacancy (v-Pd2CoAg NCs) interfaces and it is shown that the Co addition not only increases the atomic vacancies of Pd2Ag twinned interface, but also leads to the formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of CoOx. The synergistic effect of the surface atomic vacancies and metal twinned interfaces of v-Pd2CoAg NCs can tune the charge-density distribution on the surface of the electrocatalysts, and result in a 5 times increase in ORR mass activity than that of Pt/C at 0.9 V. This study provides a foundation for the rational design of 'active sites' for practical HER and ORR electrocatalysts.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000449444000044

In this paper, a Prussian blue analogue Co-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2).nH(2)O (Co-Fe PBA), as a well-known member of the metal-organic framework family, was electrospun into polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers to obtain composite Co-Fe PBA@PAN nanofibers. Nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers encapsulated FeCo alloy nanoparticles (FeCo-NCNFs-Ts, T = 700, 800, 900 degrees C) were synthesized by pyrolysizing Co-Fe PBA@PAN precursor at different temperatures under an argon atmosphere. The effects of different calcination temperatures and mass ratios between Co-Fe PBA and PAN on ORR/OER catalytic activity were explored. Among FeCo-NCNFs-Ts, FeCo-NCNFs-800 had the highest bifunctional electrocatalytic performance with a lower reversible overvoltage of 0.869 V between ORR (E-1/2) and OER (E-j = 10 mA cm(-2)), excellent stability and methanol durability, which even exceeded those of Pt/C and RuO2. The superb bifunctional activity for FeCo-NCNFs-800 was comparable to that of non noble electrocatalysts reported in recent literatures. Moreover, the zinc-air battery based on the FeCo-NCNFs-800 air-cathode catalyst had a high power density of 74 mW cm(-2) and strong cycling stability (125 cycles for 42 h), which can be comparable to a Pt/C-RuO2 zinc-air battery. The impressive bifunctional activity on ORR and OER for the FeCo-NCNFs-800 catalyst in the zinc-air battery can be attributed to the synergistic effects of the one-dimensional fibrous structure, FeCo alloy nanoparticles, Co-N (pyridinic-N) active sites, and numerous mesopores.									101	10	0	0	0	0	102			2168-0485			WOS:000460600500097

Herein, an in-situ self-reconstruction process for Ni, Fe, Zn ternary-metal hydroxides (NFZ-TH) involving significant morphology transformation, and self-modulated electronic structure change of Ni and Fe owing to the etching of Zn species under anodic polarization potential is revealed. NFZ-TH derived materials, undergoing in-situ self-reconstruction (NFZ-TH-SR), exhibits superior OER performance (eta = 217 mV @j = 10 mA cm(geometry)(-2)) and excellent stability over a period of similar to 48 h. Nano-pitted surface resulting from etching of Zn species improves the electrochemical surface area. Meanwhile, in NFZ-TH-SR, large amounts of defects induced defect-/corner-sited Fe and adjustability of NiOOH species are verified by Mossbauer spectra and in-situ Raman spectra respectively. Density functional theory calculations give insight that both defect-/corner sited Fe and Ni at next-nearest-neighbour defect-site have high activity. This paper helps understand that the proposed in-situ self-reconstruction strategy can improve the electrochemical performance of OER catalysts.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000623393100001

The morphological control in the synthesis of nanomaterials plays a crucial role in designing efficient electrocatalyst. In general, various synthetic parameters can direct the morphology of nanomaterials and often this is the main driving force for the electrocatalyst in tuning the rate of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for the electrochemical water-splitting. Here, a facile and costeffective synthesis of spinel cobalt oxides (Co3O4) via a one-pot hydrothermal pathway with tunable morphology has been demonstrated. Different kinds of morphologies have been obtained by systematically varying the reaction time i.e. nanospheres, hexagon and nanocubes. Their catalytic activity has been explored towards OER in 1.0 M alkaline KOH solution. The catalyst Co3O4-24 h nanoparticles synthesized in 24 h reaction time shows the lowest overpotential (eta) value of 296 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density, in comparison to that of other as-prepared catalysts i.e. Co3O4-pH9 (311 mV), Co3O4-12 h (337 mV), and Co3O4-6 h (342 mV) with reference to commercially available IrO2 (415 mV).

A key limitation that differentiates it from other lithium batteries is that it requires effective catalysts (or 'promoters') to enable oxygen reduction and evolution. Here, we report the synthesis of a novel metallic mesoporous oxide using surfactant templating that shows promising catalytic activity and results in a cathode with a high reversible capacity of 10,000 mAh g(-1) (similar to 1,000 mAh g(-1) with respect to the total electrode weight including the peroxide product). This oxide also has a lower charge potential for oxygen evolution from Li2O2 than pure carbon. The properties are explained by the high fraction of surface defect active sites in the metallic oxide, and its unique morphology and variable oxygen stoichiometry. This strategy for creating porous metallic oxides may pave the way to new cathode architectures for the Li-O-2 cell.									463	26	0	0	37	0	477			1755-4330	1755-4349		WOS:000311436400014	23174980

Herein, we prepared a crystalline porphyrin-based graphdiyne through Glaser-Hay coupling reactions. The accurate structure information was acquired through the SAED analysis and simulation. By simply treating with a Co2+ solution, the Co-loaded porphyrin-graphdiyne (CoPor-GDY) could be easily obtained and can serve as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution. Numerous electrocatalytic sites from Co-porphyrin moieties cooperate with the rapid transport of the butadiyne groups. In addition, the extended 2D porous structure of CoPor-GDY could provide effective transporting channels for the diffusion of small molecules and finally lead to efficient catalytic performance. CoPor-GDY exhibited an overpotential of 308 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 68 mV dec(-1) for the HER and an overpotential of 400 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 129 mV dec(-1) for the OER. This work explored a new route for the design of a non-noble metal-coordinated GDY analogue electrocatalyst for new energy devices.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10				2052-1537		WOS:000644400300001

Herein, the promising and highly efficient porous CoCrFeNiMo high entropy alloys (HEAs) were prepared by microwave sintering using Mg space holder. Owing to unique properties of high entropy alloys and abundant active surface area, the porous CoCrFeNiMo-20 Mg exhibits excellent catalytic performance and prominent electrochemical stability with a low overpotential of 220 mV to reach current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 59.0 mV dec(-1) and long-term durability for 24 h in 1.0 M KOH. The results of microstructure and element states indicate that crystal defects, porous structure and villous hydroxides are the reasons for high OER performance of the CoCrFeNiMo. This work not only provides a new way to prepare electrocatalysts, but also proves the important application of high entropy alloys in functional materials.

Iridium (Ir) and iridium oxides (IrOx) are currently the most promising candidates for an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic medium, which remains the bottleneck in water electrolysis. Yet, the extremely high costs for Ir hamper a widespread production of hydrogen (H-2) on an industrial scale. Herein, the authors report a concept for the synthesis of electrode coatings with template-controlled mesoporosity surface-modified with highly active Ir species. The improved utilization of noble metal species relies on the synthesis of soft-templated metal oxide supports and a subsequent shape-conformal deposition of Ir species via atomic layer deposition (ALD) at two different reaction temperatures. The study reveals that a minimum Ir content in the mesoporous titania-based support is mandatory to provide a sufficient electrical bulk conductivity. After ALD, a significantly enhanced OER activity results in dependency of the ALD cycle number and temperature. The most active developed electrocatalyst film achieves an outstanding mass-specific activity of 2622 mA mg(Ir)(-1) at 1.60 V-RHE in a rotating-disc electrode (RDE) setup at 25 degrees C using 0.5 m H2SO4 as a supporting electrolyte.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2196-7350			WOS:000747297400001

The potential of free oxygen ions corresponding to CO evolution in the totally diffusion controlled region was obtained from the voltammetric data. An empirical relationship between the current density on the logarithm scale and the basicity (B) of each silicate melt was established through Tafel analysis in the non-diffusion-controlled region. The obtained electrochemical data showed good correlation with thermodynamic properties such optical basicity and sulfide capacity of the silicate melts as a relative index of oxygen ion activity in molten oxides. The use of this electrochemical method to evaluate the relative potential of oxygen ions in molten oxides is discussed in detail. (C) The Author(s) 2017. Published by ECS.

Generally, cations serve as the real active sites in transition metal compound electrocatalysts, whose electrocatalytic activity is regulated by the surrounding anionic structure. Herein, an electrochemical reaction assisted by an anionic regulation strategy is proposed for precise construction of advanced electrocatalysts with extraordinary electrocatalytic activity. The electrochemical anionic regulation process ensures general release of the regulation reagents for precise substitution of sulfur anions in pristine hydroxide. The as-obtained hydroxysulfide electrocatalyst exhibits a desired electronic structure to afford superb electrocatalytic activity regarding reduced overpotential of 286 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution and improved polysulfide redox electrocatalytic activity. This contribution not only renders an emerging strategy for precise regulation of the anionic structure for improved electrocatalytic activity, but also provides information for the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts for sustainable energy applications.									63	10	0	0	2	0	65			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000544033100008

Generally, the OER process (bottleneck step) occurs more favorably in alkaline solution, while the HER process in acidic solution. Structure or composition design of electrocatalyst are effective strategies to achieve high performances for both OER and HER in alkaline environment toward overall water splitting. Herein, we report a unique electrocatalyst composed of RuO2 nanoparticles on NiCo2O4 nanocones (NCO@RuO2-NCs) hybrid structure via the hydrothermal coprecipitation and subsequent calcination. The NCO@RuO2-NCs show higher oxygen vacancy density than that of NiCo2O4@RuO2 nanosheets (NCO@RuO2-NSs). Employing the NCO@RuO2-NCs material as a bifunctional catalyst, a low cell voltage of 1.5 V is capable of overall water splitting with excellent stability of sustaining more than 42 h at 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH electrolyte, which is superior to 2.0 V of NCO@RuO2-NSs as well as 1.6 V of commercial Pt/C-RuO2 couple. The current work may provide a scalable and cost-efficient approach for developing advanced nanocomposite catalysts for water splitting.									4	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000805852100003

Observations of WD crystallization in the globular cluster NGC 6397 byWinget et al. suggest that the melting temperature of WD cores is close to that for pure carbon. If this is true, our phase diagram implies that the central oxygen abundance in these stars is less than about 60%.

The electrochemical hydrogen evolution (HER), oxygen reduction (ORR), and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions and corrosion resistance under both acidic and alkaline conditions were examined for all these catalysts and compared to those for the benchmark catalysts Pt/C (HER/ORR) and IrO2 (OER). The highest activities were found in alkaline solutions for Co2P for HER and ORR and Ni2P for OER Good activity was also found in acid for some of these reactions, although the catalysts suffered from susceptibility to corrosion. Co2P was further studied in an alkaline environment, as it shows high catalytic activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) without significant hysteresis. The onset potential (at 0.5 mA cm(-2)) obtained was 0.8 V vs RHE, and a Tafel slope value of 38 mV dec(-1) was found with a maximum kinetic mass activity of 2870 A g(Co)(-1) at 0.7 V vs RHE. Utilizing high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, it is possible to observe high-surface-area needle-like single-crystal cobalt oxide structures on the surface of the Co2P particles at the beginning of the ORR Hence the high rates of initial corrosion of the Co2P appear to be associated with the dissolution and precipitation of cobalt oxide on the particle surface. The as -synthesized Co2P/C also shows good performance in an 8-h stability test for the OER, carried out at 1.6 V vs RHE in alkaline conditions, with negligible drop in current density over time. Interestingly, in an acidic environment the catalyst is very active toward two-electron oxygen reduction, leading to H2O2 with high selectivity (85%). It is intriguing that the pH dependence of this catalyst toward the ORR is similar to that seen for gold.									140	5	0	0	7	0	141			2155-5435			WOS:000502169900084

Therefore, we constructed a nanoscale heterogeneous structure catalyst, NiFe-LDH/Co-NC (LDH = layered double hydroxide; Co-NC cobalt nanocrystal), consisting of ultrasmall NiFe-LDH nanosheets and Co-NC matrixes carbonized from ZIF-67. In 1 M KOH, NiFe-LDH/Co-NC-2 requires only an overpotential of 282 mV to catalyze a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and also has a Tafel slope of 64 mV dec-1, surpassing those of the typical OER electrocatalyst RuO2. Co-NC was able to supply a porous structure and anchoring sites, including improving the electrical conductivity of NiFe-LDH. Modified NiFe-LDH has a highly dispersed nature and therefore exposes more active sites. Moreover, the accelerated electron-transfer process caused by strong interaction between NiFe-LDH and Co-NC dramatically optimized the energy barrier of the OER. This work provides significant guidelines to design a high-performance OER of NiFe-LDH catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2574-0970		WOS:000855256500001

In present work, a simple cathodic electrodeposition (CED) method based on Fe(II)-induced oxygen deficiency-metal doping ((FeIOD)-I-II/MD) strategy was developed to prepare robust water oxidation electrocatalysts. By using Fe2+ ions as the iron precursors, a series of Ni-doped beta-FeOOH (Ni/beta-FeOOH-x) on the carbon cloth (Ni/beta-FeOOH-x/CC, here, the x is the molar percent of Fe2+ in the total ferric salt; x = 0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8 or 1) electrocatalysts with different oxygen vacancy content were prepared. Relevant characterizations indicated that the oxygen-vacancy ratio and electrocatalytic OER performances of Ni/beta-FeOOH-1/CC electrocatalysts prepared by using Fe2+ ions as the iron precursor is significantly higher than that of Fe3+. Fascinatingly, the Ni/beta-FeOOH-1/CC with massive oxygen vacancies shows an ultralow overpotential of 192 mV at the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2). Furthermore, the Ni/beta-FeOOH-1/CC catalyst can also be directly driven by a dry cell or solar cell. More importantly, the Ni/beta-FeOOH-1/CC catalyst prepared by CED method based on this (FeIOD)-I-II/MD strategy can realize water oxidation at the industrial current density, and it shows a potential industrial application value in the future.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773524600006

Herein, urchin-like iron-doped nickel cobalt phosphide (FeNiCoP) with hierarchical nanoarray structures and fine-tuned doped Fe content is fabricated through a simple hydrothermal method and subsequent phosphorization process. The optimized FeNiCoP manifests outstanding OER electrocatalytic performance in an alkaline electrolyte with a low overpotential of 259 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 40 mV.dec(-1), which is superior to the benchmark IrO2 and nickel cobalt phosphide (NiCoP) catalysts. The electrochemical activity of NiCoP can be improved by regulating the content of doped Fe. The enhanced catalytic performance of FeNiCoP can be ascribed to the unique urchin-like structure and electronic interaction among Fe, Ni, and Co elements, which expose more active sites, facilitate ion diffusion and gas release, optimize the electronic structure, and thereby enhance OER catalytic performances. Above all, these indicate that the as-prepared FeNiCoP with excellent activity and stability may be a good alternative to commercial precious metal-based catalysts.									31	2	0	0	0	0	30			2168-0485			WOS:000529151600012

Chemically coupled Co and Mo2C nanoparticles were synthesized through a simple heat treatment of the mixture containing Co and Mo precursors and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images obviously showed that Co and Mo2C nanoparticles were coupled at Co/Mo2C interfaces. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results revealed that electrons were transferred from Co to Mo2C nanoparticles across the interfaces. The electron transfer makes the Co surface more electrophilic by d-band center of Co upshift, leading to an increase in OH- affinity. As a result, the Co nanoparticles coupled with Mo2C have OER-favorable Co-oxo and Co-hydroxo configuration within their oxidized surfaces, and hence, can accelerate the overall OER than bare Co nanoparticles. This work demonstrates that the Co nanoparticles chemically coupled to Mo2C exhibited excellent OER activity and stability in an alkaline electrolyte and suggests a promising way to design an active OER catalyst.									82	8	0	0	6	0	82			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000428491000035

The use of more environmentally benign energy vectors has helped fuel cells recently become one of the most promising technologies. These devices' oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are vital processes, but their commercialization is severely constrained by slow kinetics. Consequently, creating highly effective ORR and OER bifunctional catalysts is crucial yet difficult. Pt-based catalysts have the best ORR activity but weak OER activity. The best commercial OER electrocatalysts are RuO2 and IrO2 based, although they have a subpar ORR characteristic. However, it is crucial to create electrocatalysts with low noble metal contents and high efficiencies and stabilities for OER and ORR applications. At the same time, the large-scale applications of these noble electrocatalysts are constrained due to their rarity, high cost, and poor stability. In this review paper, noble metal-based and free catalysts for ORR and OER have been reviewed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2162-8769	2162-8777		WOS:000857980700001		
J	Zhang, Lingjie; Cai, Weiwei; Bao, Ningzhong								Top-Level Design Strategy to Construct an Advanced High-Entropy Co-Cu-Fe-Mo (Oxy)Hydroxide Electrocatalyst for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction								ADVANCED MATERIALS				33	22					2100745	10.1002/adma.202100745		APR 2021		JUN 2021	2021	High-entropy materials are new-generation electrocatalysts for water splitting due to their excellent reactivity and highly tailorable electrochemical properties. Herein, a powerful top-level design strategy is reported to guide and design advanced high-entropy electrocatalysts by establishing reaction models (e.g., reaction energy barrier, conductivity, adsorption geometries for intermediates, and rate-determining step) to predict performance with the help of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Accordingly, novel high-entropy Co-Cu-Fe-Mo (oxy)hydroxide electrocatalysts are fabricated by a new low-temperature electrochemical reconstruction method and their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) properties are thoroughly characterized. These as-prepared quaternary metallic (oxy)hydroxides present much better OER performance than ternary Co-Cu-Mo (oxy)hydroxide, Co-Fe-Mo (oxy)hydroxide, and other counterparts, and are demonstrated with a low overpotential of 199 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a 48.8 mV dec(-1) Tafel slope in 1 m KOH and excellent stability without decay over 72 h. The performance enhancement mechanism is also unraveled by synchrotron radiation. The work verifies the usefulness of high-entropy design and the great synergistic effect on OER performance by the incorporation of four elements, and also provides a new method for the construction of advanced high-entropy materials for energy conversion and storage.									50	3	0	0	4	0	50			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000641294100001	33876867

Doping foreign elements into the Ir oxides can accomplish an optimal combination of Ir oxidation states that is conducive to the leaching-resistance of active catalytic sites. Here, it is reported that Pt doping into IrOx-based nanoframe is beneficial in both terms of activity and stability. The Pt-doped IrOx-based nanoframe achieves the mass activity of 0.644 A mg(Ir+Pt)(-1)at 1.53V(RHE), which is 15-fold higher than that of the commercial IrO2. During the accelerated durability test, the Ir-IV-to-Ir(III)ratio of 5 is maintained in the presence of Pt dopant to effectively mitigate the degradation of Ir catalyst, leading to the superb catalyst durability in acidic media.									37	1	0	0	0	0	36			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000550665600001

The Pr-Zr mixed oxides calcined at 600-800 degrees C show outstanding thermostability, and higher calcination temperatures result in phase segregation.

In this work, an amorphous trimetallic boride nanocatalyst (Fe-Co-2.3Ni-B) prepared by a simple approach is reported as a highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst. It exhibits an overpotential () of 274 mV to deliver a geometric current density (j(geo)) of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 38 mV dec(-1), and excellent long-term durability at a mass loading of 0.3 mg cm(-2). The impressive electrocatalytic performance originates from the unique amorphous multimetal-metalloid complex nanostructure. From application's point of view, this work holds great promise as this process is simple and allows for large-scale production of cheap, yet efficient, material.									225	9	0	0	7	0	225			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000419327200009

The Ru/RuO2 heterostructure was identified in Ru/RuO2-PRS. Taking the advantages of the Ru/RuO2 heterostructure and large specific surface area, Ru/RuO2-PRS exhibits much more improved OER activity with much lower onset potential and overpotential to reach the current density of 10 mA cm_ 2 compared with RuO2 porous powder and RuO2 nano-particles counterparts in both acidic and alkaline solution. Specifically, Ru/RuO2-PRS exhibits much improved durability because the unique Ru/RuO2 heterostructure relieves the dissolution of RuO2 at high anodic potential that has been the bottleneck of Ru-based catalysts for OER, especially in acidic electrolyte. This study provides a new strategy to promote the OER application in acidic solution.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1044-5803	1873-4189		WOS:000660287000003

Further, the electrochemical performances of the NdBa0.75Ca0.25Co2O5+delta catalyst are improved by doping transition-metal oxides (Fe2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Mn2+) into the B-sites of double perovskite oxides, facilitating the movement of electrons and oxygen-ions through oxygen vacancies. Among these, NdBa0.75Ca0.25Co1.5Fe0.5O5+delta (NBCCFe) shows the highest electrocatalytic oxygen electrode activity for the OER and ORR, and NBCCFe thus is hybridized with nitrogen-reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) to further improve its catalytic activity with excellent durability. Hybridization of NBCCFe with N-rGO further boosts bifunctional oxygen electrode activity (0.761 V) with better durability, which surpasses those of Pt/C (0.815 V) and Ir/C (0.768 V) catalysts. A rechargeable lithium-air battery assembled with the NBCCFe/N-rGO catalyst exhibits remarkably improved discharge capacity, reduced charge overpotential and an extended cycle life, corroborating the excellent bifunctional catalytic activity of NBCCFe/N-rGO. The NBCCFe/N-rGO catalyst also displays the most improved polarization during both discharge and charge, further confirming the highest bifunctional catalytic activity of NBCCFe/N-rGO.									34	0	0	0	3	0	34			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000448147200059

In the present work, considering Co-Ni hexacyanoferrate (CoxNi1-xHCF) as a PBA, CoxNi1-xHCF nanocuboids with different Co and Ni compositions were synthesized on Ni foam (NF) by hydrothermal synthesis. Further, their application toward OER and UOR catalytic activity was studied. The synthesized CoxNi1-xHCF:NF composites with high catalytic activity and conductivity exhibited superior catalytic performance for the OERs and UORs. The CoxNi1-xHCF:NF composite electrodes exhibited a lower overpotential (eta) of 334 mV with a lower Tafel slope of 72 mV dec(-1) for the OER catalytic activity and a lower potential of 1.38 V with a lower Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1) for the UOR catalytic activity. It was observed that low charge transfer resistance, high electrochemically active surface area, and availability of Co3+ ions are major factors contributing to the OER activity. The presence of oxidative Ni2+ species contributed significantly to the UOR activity. Overall, the present study elucidates the binder-free CoxNi1-xHCF:NF electrodes as stable and high-performance OER and UOR catalysts and provides pathways for designing advanced PBA catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2053-1591		WOS:000809243700001

This study demonstrates the significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity of a Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskite (A(n+1)BnO(3n+1), n = 3) as a bifunctional material [i.e., RPLaSr3(Co0.5Fe0.5)(3)O10-delta] for oxygen electrocatalysis via an optimal doping strategy. The improved performance mainly benefits from the enhanced oxygen vacancies, the facile oxygen release and incorporation abilities, the synergistic interplay of Co and Fe together with the increased amounts of adsorbed OH-/O-2, and the highly oxidative O-2(2-)/O-. The more positive onset potential (Eonset) and the highest half wave potential (E-1/2) of RP-LaSr3(Co0.5Fe0.5)(3)O10-delta imply a better ORR activity relative to those of the benchmark Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O2.59 (BSCF) and the widely referred cubic perovskite (La0.6Sr0.4)(0.95)Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (CP-LSCF). Furthermore, this material enables the electrochemical reduction of O-2 by 4e(-) to OH- with an impressive stability. More importantly, RP-LaSr3Co1.5Fe1.5O10-delta shows a largely narrowed potential gap (.E) and achieves its minimum value of 0.91 V, remarkably smaller than those of CP-LSCF (1.01 V), BSCF (1.04 V), and most of the state-of-the-art bifunctional materials. This study paves an attractive way to accurately fabricate RP-type perovskites as highly efficient and stable materials for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis.									18	0	0	0	1	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000592978900028

Merkle et al [R. Merkle, J. Maier, K.D. Becker and M. Kreye, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 6, 3633 (2004)] conducted an experimental study on the chemical diffusion of oxygen in Fe-doped SrTiO3 single crystals driven by large changes in the oxygen ambient partial pressure. The stoichiometry dependence of the chemical diffusion coefficient was derived on the basis of the concept of conservative ensembles for two independent trapping reactions, which then served for calculating the evolution of vacancy profiles. The theoretical predictions were compared to the experimental results. In the framework of the same model, in the present communication, the chemical diffusion of oxygen was analyzed by the concept of a dynamic reaction front [M. Sinder, J. Pelleg, Phys. Rev. E 61, 4935 (2000); Z. Koza, Phys. Rev. E 66, 011103 (2002)]. We show, that by using a quasi-chemical reaction rate profile, it is possible to obtain information relating to the position and width of the zone where the reaction takes place. It is indicated, that the reaction rate distribution can be directly calculated from measured concentration profiles of the immobile reactant.

In this work, we have successfully achieved iron doped cobalt phosphide ultrathin nanosheets (Fe- CoP UNSs) with a 2.3 nm thickness on a nickel foam (NF) substrate (termed Fe- CoP UNSs/NF) by high- temperature phosphidation treatment using atomically thick Fe doped cobalt oxide nanosheets as the reaction precursor. Because of the large surface area, sufficient edge active sites, synergistic effect between heteroatoms, high conductivity of the NF substrate, and porous structure of the NF substrate, Fe- CoP UNSs/NF displays outstanding electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in a 1 M KOH electrolyte, such as overpotentials of 67 and 166 mV at current densities of 10 mA cm 2 and 50 mA cm 2, respectively. More importantly, Fe- CoP UNSs/NF can serve as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, achieving a 10 mA cm 2 current density at a voltage of only 1.46 V in an alkaline electrolyte.									85	5	0	0	2	0	85			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000488618600019

In this work, a NiCo bimetal loaded on porous carbon (NiCo-C/NF) grown on nickel foam (NF) was obtained via the pyrolysis of a NiCo bimetal MOF (NiCo-MOF/NF) under a nitrogen atmosphere at 500 degrees C. Compared with NiCo-MOF/NF, NiCo-C/NF had a larger specific surface and uniform mesoporous structure. As an electrocatalyst in the OER, this new type of electrode operated with better stability in an alkaline solution (1.0 mol L-1 KOH), the overpotential when the current density reached 10 mA cm(-2) was only 260 mV, and the electrode also exhibited long-term durability in a stability test for 10 h without significant changes. The excellent activity and stability toward the OER can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the NiCo bimetal and the abundant active sites exposed after the carbonization of NiCo-MOF, which compensated for the defect of the insufficient conductivity of the material and promoted the evolution of oxygen in the catalytic process.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2046-2069		WOS:000649534900033	35479126

Herein, we demonstrate a peptide templated Au@Pd core-shell structure for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). By employing peptide sequence FlgA(3) as surface capping agent, core-shell structure with Pd nanoparticles coated on the surface of Au nanoparticles were prepared. The Au@Pd core-shell structures demonstrated effective electrocatalytic activities toward both ORR and HER, whereas the catalytic activity was optimized by tuning the Pd-to-Au ratio. Among a series of samples tested, we discovered that the Au@Pd-1.0 sample exhibited the best ORR activity, superior to that of Pt/C and Pd/C, while its HER activity was also among the finest, close to that of Pt/C and Pd/C. The Au@Pd-1.0 sample also exhibited remarkable stability beyond Pt/C and Pd/C in both ORR and HER. Such intriguing electrocatalytic performances are attributed to the core-shell structure induced lattice strain. The results offer reliable pathway for designing peptide templated core-shell bimetallic nanostructures as dual or multiple functional electrocatalysts with excellent electrocatalytic activities and longevity.

Non-noble metal compounds as substitutes for precious metals for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have been intensively studied. However, to make OER electrocatalyst efficient and stable in seawater is still an issue to be solved. In view of this, an attempt to fabricate nickel foam (NF)-enclosed reduced graphene oxide (rGO) supported sub-nanometer arrays of NiFe phosphide is reported. The as-obtained NiFeP/P-doped rGO/NF (NiFeP/P-rGO/NF) at current densities of 100 and 400 mA cm(-2) shows overpotentials of 290 and 340 mV respectively, well below 490 mV overpotential that avoided triggering chloride oxidation in seawater (1 m KOH+1 m NaCl). The Tafel slope of NiFeP/P-rGO/NF is as low as 71.9 mV dec(-1). Moreover, no considerable loss of current density is observed after 450 h at 35 mA cm(-2). This strategy is extended to fabricate CoFeP/P-rGO/NF and IrO2/rGO/NF and they also show superior activity. The combination of ultrathin NiFeP arrays and conductive network of rGO are the key to superior activity. Hydrophobicity of the rGO is accountable for good durability in seawater.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2196-7350			WOS:000726287300001

Herein, we report the crafting of a bifunctional electrocatalyst comprising ultrafine alloyed FeNi nanoparticles encapsulated within N-doped layered carbon nanosheets (denoted FeNi/N-LCN) for high-efficiency Zn-air batteries. The FeNi/N-LCN electrocatalyst is yielded via the coordination of triphenylimidazole-containing polyaniline (TPANI) oligomer with Fe- and Ni-containing precursors, followed by hydrogen binding with melamine and subsequent pyrolysis. The as-constructed FeNi/N-LCN manifests outstanding activity and stability toward both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The primary Zn-air battery assembled with FeNi/N-LCN delivers both high specific capacity and peak power density. Remarkably, the rechargeable Zn-air battery can be repeatedly charged and discharged for 1100 h at 5 mA cm(-2) and for 600 h at 10 mA cm(-2), representing the highest cycling stability among various reported Zn-air batteries.									37	2	0	0	1	0	37			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000641160500053	33819042

Therefore, it is critical to develop highly active and durable electrocatalysts to reduce the overpotential. Herein, ultra-small RuO2 nanoparticles (NPs) supported on onion-like carbon (OLC) and carbon nanotube (CNT) are successfully synthesized by means of wet impregnation combined with annealing treatment, respectively. The microstructure characterization results showed OLC perfect graphitic carbon layer structure, and the RuO2 NPs supported on the OLC possess larger particle size compared with the RuO2 NPs supported on the CNT. Moreover, the electronic structure of Ru in RuO2/OLC was also optimized by the OLC support to be beneficial for the OER. The OER performance of the catalysts were investigated in 1 M KOH solution. The results show RuO2/OLC has a comparable OER activity to the commercial RuO2, but a significantly higher mass activity than the commercial RuO2. When compared with the RuO2/CNT, RuO2/OLC not only exhibits lower overpotential and Tafel slop, but also owns more active sites and higher TOF value, indicating the OLC support improved the OER activity of RuO2/OLC. Moreover, RuO2/OLC showed a superior stability compared with RuO2/CNT, which can be attributed to the excellent electrochemical oxidation-resistance of the OLC.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000740032200001	34929685

In the presence of 10% Fe atoms, the oxophilicity of Co metal is modulated in a direction to facilitate OH- adsorption on Co3+; thus, Co0.9Fe0.1-carbon nanofiber (CNF) can exhibit smaller overpotentials than other metal ratios in Co1-xFex-CNF. Additionally, we confirm catalytic degradation from the oxidation of the carbon layer, which is triggered by defects in the carbon originating from Fe during the pyrolysis step. The Co0.9Fe0.1 metal is further optimized by increasing graphitization to simultaneously achieve superior activity and durability for application on AEMWE. This work not only demonstrates the role of Fe in Co metal for controlling the proper oxophilicity but also shows the importance of graphitized carbon as a catalyst support for stable water oxidation.

Performances of Ir-Ni and Ir-Co nanowires for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have been measured in rotating disk electrode half-cells and single-cell electrolyzers and compared with commercial baselines and literature references. The nanowire catalysts showed improved mass activity, by more than an order of magnitude compared with commercial Ir nanoparticles in half-cell tests. The nanowire catalysts also showed greatly improved durability, when acid leached to remove excess Ni and Co. Both Ni and Co templates were found to have similarly positive impacts, although specific differences between the two systems are revealed. In single-cell electrolysis testing, nanowires exceeded the performance of Ir nanoparticles by 4-5 times, suggesting that significant reductions in catalyst loading are possible without compromising performance.									132	4	0	0	5	0	133			2155-5435			WOS:000426804100056

Computational Investigation of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction Catalyzed by Nickel (Oxy)hydroxide Complexes								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				122	45			25785	25795		10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b06614				NOV 15 2018	2018	D The catalytic behavior of nickel oxy(hydroxide) complexes containing one to four nickel atoms toward the oxygen evolution reaction was investigated with density functional theory (DFT). The accuracy of the methodology was verified by comparison with the results of complete active space self-consistent field and coupled cluster calculations performed on a model nickel hydroxide system. The DFT methodology was found to be a suitable choice for investigating the oxygen evolution reaction catalyzed by nickel oxy(hydroxide) complexes. The results of the DFT calculations demonstrate the importance of the oxidation state of nickel in determining the catalytic efficiency of the clusters. A cubic cluster containing four Ni(III) atoms was found to have the best catalytic efficiency, with hydrogen abstraction free energies and an overpotential comparable to those of the bulk nickel oxyhydroxide. This cluster represents the smallest model of the bulk material. The presence of iron in a model cluster was found to increase the catalytic efficiency, which is in agreement with experimental findings on the bulk catalysts. The results presented here are expected to help efforts to design more efficient nickel oxy(hydroxide) cluster catalysts for water oxidation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1932-7447			WOS:000451101400007

Perovskite oxides are among the best catalysts for OER in alkaline solutions. In the perovskite family, La0.8Sr0.2CoO3-delta (LSC) has been reported to have OER catalytic properties dependent on the characteristics of its surface, but where its activity and stability are still not high enough for applications. In order to improve the surface catalysis of LSC, we have subjected it to multiple H2O2 treatments. After 4 treatments, lasting 6 hours each, the current density of LSC at 1.70 V (vs RHE) increased by a factor of 6.6 and concomitantly, the Tafel slope decreased from 105.5 to 76.6 mVdec(-1) compared to untreated materials. The long-term stability also improved dramatically after treatment. All these improvements are likely linked to the formation of an amorphous layer of hydrous oxide on the LSC particles during treatment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, a rapid synthesis of an Ov-engineered Co3O4 layer on Ni foam has been demonstrated through a solid-phase melting strategy, where the Ov content in the Co3O4 layer can be adjusted from 52% to 74% simply by changing melting temperature. After HER testing, this content is further adjusted to 22-45% with the same trend. Remarkably, the Co3O4 layer with a medium Ov content (32%) gives the highest mass activity of -2.12 A g(-1) at an overpotential of 200 mV for the alkaline electrocatalytic HER. Moreover, it only requires an ultrasmall overpotential of 203 mV to achieve -100 mA cm(-2), outperforming all reported Co3O4 electrocatalysts so far. The medium Ov content in the Co3O4 electrocatalyst could enhance reaction kinetics by optimizing catalytic intermediate adsorption during the alkaline HER. This feasible tactic to precisely control Ov may provide an avenue for exploring other advanced electrocatalysts.									53	3	0	0	4	0	53			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000470928800005

In consequence, developing non-noble-metal electrocatalysts with low-cost and earth-abundant for efficient and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly desirable for sustainable energy development in the future. In this paper, the flower-like nickel-cobalt aluminum alloy was synthesized by hydrothermal method using aluminum foam as base material and mixed with cobalt and nickel salts. At the same time, XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM and electrochemical tests were studied in this paper. Specifically, in 1 M KOH, we found that Ni-S-CoAl-4:1(Co/Ni=4:1) has the best OER performance, this electrode requires a low overpotential of 285 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 60 mV dec(-1).

Cobalt-based catalytic material has been widely studied as a very promising metal catalyst. However, it is difficult for single simple-type cobalt-based catalysis to meet the requirement of activity. Composite material and auxiliary methods have been used to improve catalytic activity. Herein, a gold-nanoparticle-decorated CoOOH nanoplate hierarchical hollow structure (Au/CoOOH) is designed to improve the electro-catalytic performance of water oxidation. Moreover, a photoinduced surface plasmon excited on gold nanoparticles is also introduced to further enhance the photoassisted OER activity. The synergy of Au and CoOOH improves the charge excitation and transfer, which increase the number of active sites markedly. A high turnover frequency (3.75 s(-1) at an overpotential of 360 mV) and a low overpotential of 290 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) have been achieved with the assistance of a laser. Furthermore, the monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) can reach up to 5%.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2574-0962			WOS:000510104700102

The electrocatalytic activity of CoFe2O4 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of electrochemical water splitting is investigated as a function of calcination temperature in the range between 300 and 450 degrees C. It is significantly found that a drastic cation redistribution in octahe-dral and tetrahedral sites within the spinel structure of 450 degrees C-calcinated CoFe2O4 p-type semiconductor leads to the dramatic enhancement in hole density and concomitant OER activity. The CoFe2O4 integrated on carbon fiber paper (CFP) exhibits high electrocatalytic performance, including an overpotential (eta(10)) of 359 mV at10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 53.8 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. Based on this work, a design principle of the MOD solution process developed can be applied to preparation of a greater variety of compounds. Also, elucidation of structure-OER activity relationships in spinel-type CoFe2O4 electrocatalysts will be able to advance further. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The synthesized samples are found efficient for photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and photodegradation of organic dyes (methylene blue/methyl orange). It has been observed that CuO/TiO2@MOF-5 shows lowest onset potential, highest current density and better OER activity as compared to some of previously reported Cu-based working electrodes.

It uses carbon soot as a nanostructure template, which is sequentially coated with a conductive niobium-doped titanium oxide (NTO) layer and an ultrathin, highly pure IrO2 catalyst layer by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The NTO acts as an oxidation-stable conductor between the metal current distributor and the catalyst. The highly controlled film growth by ALD enables the fabrication of electrodes with a very low noble metal loading. Nonetheless, these electrodes exhibit very high catalytic activity and good stability under cyclic and constant load conditions. At an IrO2 content of less than 10 percent by mass of the oxide material and an area-based Ir content of 153 mu g cm(-2), the nanostructured NTO/IrO2 electrode achieves an oxygen evolution current density of 1 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of similar to 250 mV, which is significantly lower than the reported values for particulate NTO/IrO2 catalysts.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000484234700024	31317996

To address this issue, here we report the fabrication of a RuO2/(Co,Mn)(3)O-4 nanocomposite with low Ru loading (2.51 wt%) as a highly efficient OER catalyst in acidic media (0.5 M H2SO4). Spectroscopic and theoretical studies demonstrate that the introduction of Mn in Co3O4 results in redistribution of electrons and the generation of electron-rich Ru species of the RuO2/(Co, Mn)(3)O-4 catalyst. With modulated electronic properties, the adsorption of O on RuO2/(Co,Mn)(3)O-4 is weakened and the rate determining step, formation of OOH*, of the OER process is therefore accelerated. At such a low Ru loading, RuO2/(Co,Mn)(3)O-4 exhibits superior acidic OER activity (eta = 270 mV at 10 mA/cm(2)) and long-term stability to the benchmark RuO2 catalyst. This work provides a new strategy for the design of cost-effective acidic OER electrocatalysts for energy conversion applications.									42	0	0	0	0	0	42			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000700080800006

Here, we design a template electro-etching strategy to fabricate uniform FeOOH nanotubes (CC@FeOOH-NTs) as photoactive electrocatalysts, where the in situ conversion process of template etching and electrodeposition completes in less than 400 s. The structural stability of the nanotubes' morphology and phase transition from beta-FeOOH to amorphous after thermal treatments are both determining factors to improve the activity and stability. The optimized CC@FeOOH-NTs-240 degrees C presents a low overpotential (II) of 328 mV, to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 42 mV dec(-1), and maintains its structural integrity and catalytic activity after 15 h. Under visible light irradiation, the photon-excited charge carriers decrease the overpotential to 280 mV (onset) and increase the current density to 16 mA cm(-2) (eta = 343 mV), 2.7 times higher than the value in the darkness.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			2574-0962			WOS:000458706600067

They are based on studies of a detailed nuclear network compiled by the authors and are defined by approximate sets of differential equations whose derivations are included in the text. The first network, N1, provides a good first-order estimation of the distribution of ashes and it also provides a simple picture of the main reactions occurring during this phase of evolution. The second network, N2, is a more refined version of N1 and can reproduce the evolution of the main physical properties of the full network to the 5% level. We compare the evolution of the mole fraction of the relevant nuclei, the neutron excess, the photon energy generation, and the neutrino losses between both simplified networks and the detailed reaction network in a fixed temperature and density parcel of gas.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0067-0049	1538-4365		WOS:000283845500010

JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				903						115842	10.1016/j.jelechem.2021.115842		NOV 2021		DEC 15 2021	2021	Electrocatalytic water splitting activity trend is mainly justified using two activity markers namely the electrochemical surface area measured in terms of double-layer capacitance (Cdl) and the charge transfer resistance (Rct). In general, a better active catalyst always tends to have higher Cdl and lower Rct. The non-Faradaic Cdl has so far been shown to match with the Faradaic catalytic activity trend. Nonetheless, emphasizing its nonFaradaic origin and the fact that all ion adsorption and desorption sites should not necessarily be electrocatalytically active sites, we show here a strong disagreement between non-Faradaic Cdl and Faradaic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity trend between stainless steel (SS) and bleached stainless steel (BSS). BSS apparently exhibited higher Cdl due to increased OER inactive iron oxide contents on the surface while significantly losing its OER activity. This study, therefore, questions the credibility of using non-Faradaic Cdl to justify the purely Faradaic electrocatalytic activity trend.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000730163000002

Herein, a squarate-based metal-organic framework (MOF) ([Co-3(C4O4)(2)(OH)(2)].3H(2)O) is reported for electrocatalytic water oxidation. A facile, green, and low-cost strategy is proposed to introduce defects by not only rationally breaking Co-O bonds to form defective coordination environment and electronic reconfiguration, but also systematically modulates defect concentration to optimize electrochemical performance. As a result, the post-treated surface defective MOF derivative (Co-MOF-3h) achieves a current density of 50 mA cm(-2)at an overpotential of 380 mV, owing to larger active surface area, more opened active sites, and favorable conducting channels. Finally, density functional theory calculations have further validated the effect of defective coordination in regard to electronic structure for electrocatalysts. This study delivers inspirations in defect engineering and is in favor of developing high-efficiency electrocatalysts.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000571750000001	32964633

The Co2B and Co nanoparticles are formed and anchored on the generated N and B codoped carbon and undecomposed B4C. The hybrid exhibits remarkable catalytic performances toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) a very small potential of 1.53 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER and a high catalytic kinetics and superior durability for the ORR which are superior to the RuO2 and Pt/C catalyst, respectively. Most impressively, the hybrid delivers a very small potential gap of 710 mV, which is lower than those of most bifunctional electrocatalysts reported. In addition, the hybrid also shows a satisfying hydrogen evolution reaction performance offering a small overpotential of 220 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and wonderful stability.

Ni-W alloy coatings were electrodeposited and their electrocatalytic activity towards alkaline water splitting for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH were studied. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronopotentiometry (CP)techniques were used to quantify their electrocatalytic behaviors. It demonstrated the inverse dependency of electrocatalytic behaviors of coatings towards HER and OER at low and high c.d.'s, respectively. This is attributed to the change in the composition, in terms of Ni and W content of the alloy. The surface features, structural and compositional change of coatings, responsible for improved electrocatalytic activity were examined using Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) techniques.

Boosting the intrinsic activity and the active-site density through rational design of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and metal-organic gels (MOGs) as precursors represents a new approach toward improving oxygen electrocatalysis efficiency. MOFs/MOGs afford a broad selection of combinations between metal nodes and organic linkers and are known to produce electrocatalysts with high surface areas, variable porosity, and excellent activity after pyrolysis. Some recent studies on MOFs/MOGs for oxygen electrocatalysis and their new perspectives in synthesis, characterization, and performance are discussed. New insights on the structural and compositional design in MOF/MOG-derived oxygen electrocatalysts are summarized.

The stability of the Au TEM grid particularly the coated carbon supporting film is a critical issue for the implementation of ILTEM techniques of electrocatalysts working at highly oxidative potentials such as oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, we report the electrochemical stability of Au TEM grid coated with carbon supporting film at potentials up to 1.8 V/RHE in both acid and alkaline electrolytes. While showing a higher extent of corrosion in alkaline electrolyte, the carbon supporting film coated on the Au grid generally exhibited a good stability ( < 10% damage ratio) when holding at constant potentials up to 1.6 V/RHE in both acid and alkaline electrolytes. The likely Au dissolution and redeposition at the OER potentials up to 1.8 V was also studied. Our results not only support the feasibility but also provide a guidance for ILTEM studies of oxygen evolution electrocatalysts or other electrocatalysts working at oxidative potentials.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000446283100007

We present our investigation on the role of strain on the surface-oxygen interaction and the OER on well-defined single-termination SrIrO3 films. Our approach employs a combination of molecular-beam epitaxy, electrochemical characterizations, ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT). We find that inplane compressive strain weakens the surface oxygen binding strength on SrIrO3; however, it has a negligible effect on the surface oxygen electroadsorption and the OER. We explain this observation, which goes against a commonly held intuition that a change in the surface oxygen binding strength should influence surface oxygen electroadsorption and OER by recognizing that the trend in surface oxygen adsorption measured in the gas phase does not account for the presence of water in the surface oxygen electroadsorption. Inclusions of surface water molecules allow DFT to qualitatively reproduce the electroadsorption trend, highlighting the importance of surface water in the surface-oxygen interaction. Our finding suggests that a commonly held assumption between surface oxygen binding strength (in vacuum, no water) and electroadsorption (requiring water) is not always a simple one-to-one description and calls for a more in-depth investigation on the structure of water at electrochemical interfaces.									30	1	0	0	0	0	30			1932-7447			WOS:000426802500029

Herein, a facile route was proposed to prepare Zr-doped Ni/Fe (oxy)hydroxide layer grown on Ni-Fe foam (Zr-NiFe(OH)x/ NFF) by chloride ions in-situ corrosion strategy in "NaCl-ZrOCl2" mixed solution. The smooth NFF surface was effectively transformed into a rough multimetallic (oxy)hydroxide nanosheet with high electrochemical specific surface area and strong bonding to the substrate, resulting in excellent interface performance for mass transfer and charge transfer. Specifically, the incorporation of Zr4+ regulated the electronic environment around the Ni/ Fe center, as a result, adsorption energies were optimized and the inherent OER activity of active sites was enhanced. The Zr-NiFe(OH)x/NFF self-supporting electrode exhibited outstanding OER electrocatalytic activity where low overpotentials of 211 and 245 mV were obtained to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm-2 respectively, along with impressive durability for 40 h.

The initial activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of the synthesized Meso-RuO2 catalyst is compared with that of the state-of-the-art catalyst (IrO2) and a high surface area RuO2 catalyst synthesized by the well-known Adams method (Ad-RuO2), respectively. The synthesized Meso-RuO2 catalyst exhibited lower overpotential of 266 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) than IrO2 (308 mV) or Ad-RuO2 (326 mV). Furthermore, the overpotential difference in the OER before and after the accelerated stability test for MesoRuO(2) was only 26 mV, indicating tolerable electrochemical stability. The enhanced activity and stability for the OER of the Meso-RuO2 could be attributed to the effect of the ordered mesoporous structure of RuO2 and the good electronic conductivity index (ratio of the electrochemical surface area and specific surface area). This study provides significant insights into the relationship between the OER performance and physicochemical properties of the catalysts.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000600845700012

Herein, a facile large-scale synthesis strategy is designed for unique Fe-doped Ni-based metal-organic polymer@carbon nanotubes (CNTs) composites that may be used as OER electrocatalysts without further treatment. The Ni1.95Fe-MOP@CNTs deliver a small overpotential of 256 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and their Tafel slope is low to 58 mV dec(-1). In addition, the catalyst displays high durability after a long-term test of 60 000 s. Introducing Fe ions and CNTs into Ni-based compounds increases the surface area and enhances the degree of graphitization and the composite conductivity, contributing to the excellent catalytic performance. The charge transfer reaction dynamics are explored using in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry. Surprisingly, the Ni1.95Fe-MOP@CNTs demonstrate a Faraday efficiency of (approximate to 92.7%) for O-2 production. These findings pave a new way for synthesizing catalysts without post-processing for water oxidation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2366-7486			WOS:000589543000001

As one of the most promising OER catalysts, NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) can be rationally tailored via defect engineering to achieve enhanced catalytic performance. Herein, we report a fluoride precovered surface strategy to manipulate the coordinatively unsaturated metal sites of NiFe LDH catalysts. The adsorption of fluoride is introduced during the crystallization process with flexible amount, and the precovered fluoride can be easily removed by electrochemical treatment, leaving a controllable density of unsaturated metal sites with high activity toward OER. Specifically, NiFe LDH with an optimized amount of fluoride precovered demonstrates an overpotential of 243 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, with a reduced Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1), exhibiting enhanced catalytic performance than pristine NiFe LDH. Such a precovered surface strategy can effectively manipulate the density of coordinatively unsaturated metal sites and has great potential in catalyst design with high performance via defect engineering.									59	1	0	0	0	0	59			2155-5435			WOS:000577156300027

The prepared nanoparticles were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance (UV-Vis DRS) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and N-2 physisorption measurements. The photocatalytic performance of these materials was investigated for H-2 evolution using aqueous ammonia media under 254 nm UV light. The H-2 evolution was compared with TiO2 Evonik P25. Beside H-2 photocatalytic generation, H-2 photochemical generation was also observed. The different used synthetic procedure leading to the formation of different defects (oxygen vacancies (Vo) and oxygen excess defects (O-i/O-zn)) in the ZnO lattice were factors influencing photocatalytic production of hydrogen. Oxygen vacancy (Vo) was recognized as defect significantly decreasing photocatalyst activity. The highest yields of hydrogen were observed in ZnO prepared by thermal annealing of zinc acetate in air. This photocatalyst possesses the lowest concentration of oxygen vacancies causing efficient trapping of electrons. Consequently higher number of electrons in conduction band was available for photocatalytic reaction. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It makes significant sense to develop energy and time-efficient approaches to prepare active and stable OER catalysts for H-2 generation through electrochemical water-splitting, but it is still a great challenge. In this work, we designed a reliable quenching strategy to construct homogeneous array of sulfur-modified Co(OH)(2) nanosheets for efficient water electrolysis. Specifically, the S-Co(OH)(2) electrodes performed excellent OER behavior, delivering a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 323 mV, exhibiting a small Tafel slope of 62.5 mV dec(-1) and maintaining approximately similar to 90% of the original current density after 20 h of chronoamperometry testing.

By regulating the electronic structure of isolated single-atom metal sites, high-performance transition-metal-based catalysts can be fabricated to greatly improve the OER performance. Herein, we demonstrate single-atom manganese coordinated to nitrogen and sulfur species in two-dimensional graphene nanosheets Mn-NSG (NSG means N- and S- codoped graphene) as an active and durable OER catalyst with a low overpotential of 296 mV in alkaline media, compared to that of the benchmark IrO2 catalyst. Theoretical calculations and experimental measurements reveal that the Mn-N3S sites in the graphene matrix are the most active sites for the OER due to modified electronic structure of the Mn site by three nitrogen and one sulfur atoms coordination, which show lower theoretical overpotential than the Mn-N-4 sites and over which the O-O formation step is the rate-determining step.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000787142600006

Besides the application of the additional catalyst, the laser treatment enhances the surface area and a defined micro- and submicrometer structure is created in a single step. The laser structured nickel-iron electrodes show a significantly lower overpotential of 249 mV than an electrochemically deposited Ni-NiFe alloy with 292 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), 298 K and 32.5 wt% KOH for the OER, although some loss of iron over time could not be prevented.

However, their large scale deployment hinges on the discovery of cheap and efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, the successful synthesis of a bifunctional hybrid electrocatalyst capable of driving both OER and ORR is reported, comprising Co, N-codoped carbon nanoframes (Co, N-CNF) decorated with 14 nm Ni3FeN particles, in which the Co, N-codoped carbon nanoframe (Co, N-CNF) with ORR activity was introduced as a scaffold to disperse the precursors and mitigate their further aggregation. The Ni3FeN/Co, N-CNF hybrid afforded remarkable OER activity (over-potential of 0.27 V, superior to IrO2) and excellent ORR performance (half-wave potential of 0.81 V vs RHE, superior to Pt/C), the origins of which can be traced to the inherent activities of the metallic Ni3FeN nanoparticles and Co, N-CNF support, respectively. Cathodes made from the Ni3FeN/Co, N-CNF electrocatalyst demonstrated superior efficiency and durability to state-of-the-art Pt/C+IrO2 electrocatalysts in both primary and rechargeable zinc-air batteries, showcasing the versatility of the newly developed Ni3FeN/Co, N-CNF electrocatalyst system.									123	8	0	0	2	0	125			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000411687800044

In this paper, the tremella-like MnO2/(Fe,Ni)(3)S-4 hybrid nanostructures are supported on nickel foam matrix by a facile and governable method, with predominant OER properties in 1.0 M KOH solution. Profiting from the synergistic effect between MnO2 and (Fe,Ni)(3)S-4, this optimal MnO2/(Fe,Ni)(3)S-4 catalyst only requires 220 and 325 mV to fulfill current densities of 10 and 500 mA cm(-2), respectively. Through the inheritance and optimization of MnO2 and (Fe,Ni)(3)S-4 nanostructures, this hybrid catalyst possesses a large specific surface area, appropriate exposure active site and favorable electrical conductivity. Besides, the selfsupported MnO2/(Fe,Ni)(3)S-4 electrode exhibits eminent stability at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) during the 20 h OER process.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000711632700001

Herein, a novel Nd6Ir2O13 electrocatalyst was synthesized and first applied in acidic OER During the OER, surface Nd atoms are leached out to form active hydrated IrOx; meanwhile, the coordination environment of Ir remains relatively stable. Benefiting from the low Ir content (26.4 wt %), Nd6Ir2O13 affords an Ir mass activity of 123.5 mA per mg fr at an overpotential of 300 mV, about 42-fold that of IrO2. Notably, Nd6Ir2O13 needs an ultralow overpotential of 291 mV to acquire a current density of 10 mA cm 72 and continuously catalyzes OER for 70,000 s with little overpotential increase, far beyond that of the benchmark IrO2 and most of the electrocatalysts for the acidic OER. This work opens a new type of Irbased oxides with ultralow Ir content, which expands the acidic OER electrocatalyst family of multimetal oxides.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-0485			WOS:000840622100001

Here, amorphous ternary metal borides (Ni-Ce-B) with different molar ratios of Ce% are achieved by a facile wet chemical method. With the optimal 5% of Ce, the as-prepared Ni-Ce-B-5/NF electrode exhibits comparable OER performance with lower overpotential (240 mV) than that of pure Ni-B/NF electrode (330 mV) and other metal borides. The high activity of Ni-Ce-B/NF is attributed to the amorphous structure and synergistic effect of binary metal Ni and Ce in Ni-Ce-B materials. Additionally, CeO2-x forms and serves as an electron acceptor during the self-electrooxidation process, facilitating the formation of crystalline high-valence nickel species, resulting in robust electrocatalysis and long-term stability. This work presents a Ce-based metal boride as a promising candidate for the low-cost and highly efficient OER catalyst.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2468-0230			WOS:000702507000003

However, how to develop electrocatalysts for efficient oxidize organic compounds with depressed side-reaction (oxygen evolution reaction, OER) still remains a challenge. Herein, we report an integrated efficient electrocatalyst for the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) based on ultrathin layered double hydroxides (LDHs) nanosheet array (NSA) exposed with abundant oxygen vacancies. A high faradaic efficiency at a high potential (99.4% at 1.52 V vs. RHE) is achieved, which implies largely depressed OER process and stands at the highest level compared with previously reported electrocatalysts. Furthermore, A two-electrode electrolyzer was also assembled based on the LDHs NSA, giving rise to a much low voltage for HMF oxidation, a high H-2 yield of 44.16 L h(-1) m(-2) as well as excellent stability.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000703598500001

In this study, modified nanocomposite anodes were synthesized by applying pulsed and constant direct current electrodeposition to improve the catalytic activity of the electrodes toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and reduce energy consumption in zinc electrowinning. By decreasing particle size, the active surface area of PbO2-RuO2 nano-mixed composite electrode was 2.88 and 14.22 times greater than PbO2 -RuO2 microcomposite and pure PbO2 electrodes, respectively. Also, the anodic polarization of PbO2-RuO2 microcomposite showed a 0.201 V decrease at 0.01 A cm(-2) in the OER overpotential as compared to pure micro PbO2. Among the synthesized anodes, the Ti/PbO2-RuO2 nano-mixed morphology composite anode possessed the lowest overpotential and the least specific energy consumption by 0.705 V at a current density of 0.14 A cm(-2) and 2.11 kWh kg(-1), respectively.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0888-5885			WOS:000685242100010

The phase composition of the synthesized catalysts, their morphology and surface structure were studied by physical methods for bulk and surface analysis, such as electron microprobe analysis (EMPA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and BET technique. The catalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline aqueous solution was investigated using the common electrochemical techniques. It was found that PtCo/Ebonex facilitates essentially the oxygen evolution which starts at lower overpotentials and proceeds with higher rate compared to both the supported Pt and unsupported PtCo catalysts. The observed effect is prescribed to metal-metal and metal-support interactions. The Ebonex possesses a good electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance at high anodic potentials and despite its low surface area is considered as a potential catalyst carrier for the oxygen evolution reaction.

The effects of O-2 plasma on morphological, structural, compositional, and optical properties have been investigated systematically. Both the physical and chemical effects of plasma on the MoS2 shell are observed, whereas the MoO(2 )core remained unaffected. HR-TEM images showed that reactive species had enough energy to break and rupture the MoS2 layers. XPS revealed that the incorporation of O-2 species from plasma resulted in different oxidation states of Mo. The oxygen-incorporated MoS2 in core-shell nanostructure demonstrates excellent hydrogen evolution reaction activity with high stability. A reaction mechanism is proposed describing the changes in morphology of the nanostructured thin films after exposure to O-2 plasma.									15	1	0	0	1	0	15			2574-0970			WOS:000510073600076

In this study, both the carbon deposition and sulfur evolution in the reduction of a calcium sulfate (CaSO4) oxygen carrier with a typical syngas were investigated using thermodynamic simulations. The effects of reaction temperature, operating pressure and the oxygen ratio number (defined in this paper) on the amount of deposited carbon and released sulfurous gases are discussed. A reaction temperature from 750 to 950 degrees C, an operating pressure from 1 to 15 bars and an oxygen ratio number between 0.4 and 0.8 were determined to be the most favorable operating conditions. In addition, the amounts of released sulfurous gases were found to be largely dependent on the partial pressures of H-2 and CO based on the thermo-gravimetric analyzer (TGA) tests. When the partial pressure of H-2 or CO was above 40 kPa, the release of sulfurous gases could be prevented in the reaction between CaSO4 and syngas, even if the reaction temperature was as high as 1000 degrees C. The XRD profiles of the products also demonstrated that the mole fraction of CaS in the products increased gradually with an increasing partial pressure of H2 or CO, until the products were almost pure CaS.

Herein, we rationally synthesized a manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) doped Ni2P nanosheet (MnFe-Ni2P) as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for OER in alkaline solution by a simple hydrothermal method and phosphorylation. The bimetal-doped phosphide nanosheets are directly grown on the conductive nickel foam (NF) to form a 3D structure which facilitates to expose active sites as much as possible. Due to the electron interaction between the Mn, Fe and Ni, which contributes to ion diffusion and gas release, trimetallic MnFe-Ni2P/NF delivers an extremely low overpotential of 220 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 53 mV dec(-1) in alkaline electrolyte towards OER. Furthermore, the excellent stability of MnFe-Ni2P/NF lasts for at least 24 h at a high current density of 50 mA cm(-2) without much deviation. We demonstrate that the trimetallic MnFe-Ni2P/NF benefits from the doping of Mn, Fe elements and the unique flower-like structure, exhibits more effective electrocatalytic activity compare to conventional noble metal catalysts and Ni2P series materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000850409200012

Herein, we report a facile in-situ etching method to convert commercial stainless steel felt (SSF) into NiFe2O4 octahedral nanoparticles as an efficient and robust OER electrode. This preparation method of NiFe2O4 is different from the conventional ones, both nickel and iron elements come from the substrate itself without extra addition of precursors, as well as NiFe2O4 octahedral nanoparticles are self-grown directly on the substrate without binder. The treated SSF shows good water oxidation properties with low overpotential, small Tafel slope, and durable stability at 500 mA cm-2 for 200 h. Moreover, the effect of NaNO3 in the etchant is studied carefully, which plays the function of removal of chromium and promoting the formation of octahedral nanoparticles, resulting in the enhancement of conductivity and catalytic activity.

In the work, we design the nitrogen and molybdenum co-doped CoP with nanohoneycombs structure on three-dimensional (3D) nitrogen-doped porous graphene (N/Mo-CoP@NPG) as an efficient OER electrocatalyst. The N/Mo-CoP@NPG delivers the current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a low overpotential value of 201 mV in 1.0 M KOH, meanwhile the electrocatalytic activity shows no obvious degradation after 50 h. The NPG substrate provides plentiful ligaments for growth of N/Mo-CoP nanohoneycombs and 3D network for rapid electronic transfer. Additionally, doping N and Mo atoms into CoP synergistically modifies the micromorphology and electronic structure, benefiting the electrocatalytic ability.

We reported a porous amorphous MoO42--doped nickel-iron hydroxide (NiFeMo) composite on nickel foam (NF) via a facile electrodeposition method. The as-prepared NiFeMo/NF electrode displays a highly efficient catalytic activity for OER in alkaline solution and delivers a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) with an overpotential merely of 230 mV in 1.0M KOH. The catalyst also exhibits extraordinary performance at high current densities and is comparable to the some Ni-based OER electrocatalysts reported to date. The high active surface areas, high surface wettability and the low charge-transfer resistance of NiFeMo/NF catalysts by a doping of MoO42-, together with effective mass transport offered by the hierarchical 3D macroporous structure, all contribute to the extraordinary synergistic OER performance.

Such an anode revealed an overpotential of 258 +/- 3.2 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 mol L-1 KOH solution, which is much lower than that of pure CuO nanowires or Co3O4 nanosheets based electrode. This should be attributed to the smart hybridization of CuO nanowires and Co3O4 nanosheets into hierarchical core/shell array configuration which could largely increase the amount of contact areas between electrolyte and active sites. Moreover, it is found that the Cu2+ in CuO/Co3O4 composite was oxidized to Cu3+ components during the OER process, which should serve as the new catalytic active sites for OER. It is expected to provide a novel route to prepare such a core-shell electrocatalyst with high performance for water splitting. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Surface/interface engineering is regarded as the most effective method for activating the active sites and modulating the electronic structure, which are two crucial factors determining the electrocatalytic performance. Herein, amorphous CoMn LDH ultrathin nanosheets doped by Ir are integrated with low-crystalline NiMoO4 na-norods (Ir-NiMoO4/Ir-CoMn LDH) to fabricate advanced hierarchical OER electrocatalysts. The optimized Ir-NiMoO4/Ir-Co3Mn2 LDH exhibits excellent OER performance as attested by an ultralow overpotential of 221 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), as well as superb long-term durability. The intimate interface between NiMoO4 and Co LDH and modified electronic structure induced by Ir and Mn doping can greatly optimize the binding strength of between active sites and intermediated species, which improves the electrocatalytic OER performance. This study manifests how the synergistic surface/interface engineering design of nanomaterials boosts their catalytic activity.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The core-shell composites demonstrate excellent electrocatalytic behavior due to its unique 3D core-shell microstructure and the optimized electron migration pathway. When NiFe-LDH anchors on the surface of NiCo2O4 , the formation of Fe3+, Ni3+ and Co2+ in the composite induced by electrons migrate from Fe2+ and Ni2+ in the NiFe-LDH shell to Co3+ in the NiCo2O4 core can significantly promote charge transfer across interface and thereby boosting its oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In comparison to its single-component and hydroxide, the composite delivers a low overpotential of 363 mV for 50 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 53.03 mV.dec(-1), and satisfactory long-term stability, which makes it comparable to commercial IrO2 catalysts. These results show on how 3D core-shell architecture and valence states of metal oxides influence on OER performance in NiFe-LDH/NiCo2O4 electrocatalysts and provide new insights for regulating LDH-based electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-3697	1879-2553		WOS:000793756200001

There is a strong demand from industry for improved performance and reduction of the Ir amount. Here, we report a composite catalyst, IrOx-TiO2-Ti (ITOT), with a high concentration of active OH species and mixed valence IrOx on its surface. We have discovered that the obtained ITOT catalyst shows an outstanding OER activity (1.43 V vs RHE at 10 mA cm(-2)) in acidic media. Moreover, no apparent potential increase was observed even after a chronopotentiometry test at 10 mA cm(-2) for 100 h and cyclic voltammetry for 700 cycles. We proposed a detailed OER mechanism on the basis of the analysis of the in situ electrochemical X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations. All together, we have concluded that controllable Ir-valence and the high OH concentration in the catalyst is crucial for the obtained high OER activity.									59	1	0	0	2	0	59			2155-5435			WOS:000480503700040

However, the catalytic activity of BSCF perovskites is constrained by a low specific surface area (0.5m(2)g(-1)). We report here, for the first time, a facile, in situ template method using tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) to synthesize porous BSCF with surface areas of up to 32.1m(2)g(-1), which to our knowledge is the highest reported surface area in a BSCF perovskite, and with excellent catalytic activity for the OER. For example, the BCSF prepared using a TEOS-to-BSCF ratio of 3.4 exhibited up to 35.2Ag(-1) at 1.63V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (overpotential, =0.4V) and this current is 5.3 times that exhibited by nonporous BSCF (6.6Ag(-1)). The high activity of the porous BCSF is attributed to the additional catalytic surface sites available in the pores created by the in situ TEOS-template method. The general application of this technique to produce porous perovskites is demonstrated in the synthesis of a second example, porous LaMnO3.									37	1	0	0	2	0	37			2196-0216			WOS:000349560200002

Herein, we demonstrate a novel heterointerface engineered NiFe(OH)(x)/Ni3S2 electrocatalyst to successfully circumvent the scaling relationship of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which significantly decreases the difference of the Gibbs free energy of HOO* and HO*(Delta G(HOO)* - Delta G(HO)*) from 3.20 to 2.38 eV. To achieve an ultrahigh current density of 2000 mA cm(-2), the NiFe(OH)(x)/Ni3S2 electrocatalyst requires a small overpotential of 310 mV with an ultralow Tafel slope of 20.8 mV dec(-1). It can also steadily operate under 1000 mA cm(-2) for over 100 h with insignificant activity loss, thus surpassing the state-of-the-art OER catalysts to date. A parallel catalytic mechanism has been disclosed to be responsible for the optimization of the reaction pathway, thus realizing the homogenization of multi-intermediate adsorption energy with extremely elevated OER catalytic performance at ultrahigh current densities. These findings could be a guidance in developing industrial-grade high-performance electrocatalysts for water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000865919800001

In order to improve its catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) and oxygen evolution reactions (OERs), many attempts have been made. In this work, a series of transition metal (TM) atoms were anchored on the Janus MoSSe surface to screen effective TM single-atom catalysts for HERs and OERs through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Fe@MoSSe presents excellent HERs performance and Ni@MoSSe presents excellent catalytic performance for OERs with extremely low over-potential of 0.32 V. The enhanced activity is attributed to the modest energy level of the d band center of the transition metal atom, and the transition metal atom improves the conductivity of the original MoSSe and offers unoccupied states near the Fermi level. At the same time, the anchoring of transition metal atoms redistributes the charge in the MoSSe system, which effectively regulates the electronic structure of the material itself. The strain calculation shows that the activity of the catalyst can be improved by reasonably adjusting the value of the applied strain.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1420-3049		WOS:000856737900001	36144773

Here, we demonstrated a strategy to improve ammonia generation by enhancing water oxidation through an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) cocatalyst. We employed cobalt oxyhydroxide as an OER cocatalyst for a well-known nitrogen reduction photocatalyst bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl). A series of cobalt-doped BiOCl (Co-BiOCl) nanoplatelets were synthesized through a combination of coprecipitation and hydrothermal synthesis with systematic variation in the percentage of added cocatalyst. The formation of a few atom clusters of cobalt oxyhydroxide was verified via X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron microscopy, Raman, and infrared spectroscopy. A 4.6-fold improvement in the ammonia production rate was realized with 5% Co-BiOCl. OER from water using Co-BiOCl was performed and correlated well with the ammonia generation. Enhancing water oxidation by loading of an OER cocatalyst points a promising and applicable method for better N-2 fixation photocatalyst design. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

At present, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as OER catalyst still has some shortcomings, such as poor conductivity and high-temperature synthesis, which seriously limits its application in electrocatalysis. Here, we synthesize amorphous metal-organic frameworks (aMOFs) by a simple chemical method at room temperature. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicated that the different electronegativity of substituents could dramatically influence the metal center in aMOFs. These aMOFs exhibit different OER performances in basic aqueous solutions, in which the A(0.25) B-NiFe showed the lowest overpotential of 237 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density and Tafel slope of 60 mV dec(-1). These heuristic results demonstrate that the electronegativity of substituents has a profound influence on the metal active sites of the catalysts. This will provide a new strategy for accelerating the application of MOFs in electrocatalysis and energy conversion. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Among all the frequently used techniques, electrochemically splitting water possesses the predominant position, while it only accounts for 4% of globally producing hydrogen. However, the high cost and low efficiency of catalysts promoting the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are main reasons causing the relatively low production rate. Here, we constructed RuO2 nanosheets (NRO NSs) by the exfoliation of layered RuO2 intercalated with sodium nanoparticles (NRO NPs). To optimize the catalytic properties of noble metals, turning atom arrangement can be a way to reach the aim. NRO NSs exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity toward OER with a low overpotential of 220 and 330 mV to stimulate the current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) in acidic electrolyte. After running for 20 h at 1.45 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode), NRO NSs catalyst does not show obvious deactivation or decomposition, demonstrating that high stability for NRO NSs can be achieved while retaining high activity for OER. This work offers a new perspective for designing admirable electrocatalysts and the two-dimensionalization of bulk materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2522-0128	2522-0136		WOS:000821718500001

Herein, we report a three-dimensional (3D) trimetallic nickel-iron-cobalt phosphide with a hierarchical nanoarray structure grown in situ on carbon cloth via a combined method of two-step hydrothermal reaction and following low-temperature phosphating using a carbon cloth as a conductive substrate. The synthesized NiFeP/CoP/CC exhibits excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance, giving small overpotentials of 250 mV, 270 mV and 320 mV at current densities of 20 mA cm(-2), 50 mA cm(-2) and 200 mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte, respectively, with a small Tafel slope of 51 mV dec(-1). In addition, the catalytic activity of the material remains stable for at least 50 h, and the turnover frequency (TOF) is 0.466 mol 02 s(-1) at an over potential of 300 mV. These properties of the material are comparable to those of the noble metal catalyst RuO2/CC, which may be ascribed to the hierarchical microstructure, good conductivity and desirable synergistic effect among metal ions.

This suggested that more complicated reaction models taking into account the structure of the redox material are needed to describe the whole extent of the experimental data. Based on the above, a minimum set of experiments for water splitting thermochemical cycles over a Nickel-ferrite was deigned and performed involving an increased duration of the reaction steps. A new extended model was derived for the water splitting and thermal reduction reactions, which considers two oxygen storage regions of the redox material communicating to each other by a solid state diffusion mechanism. The inclusion of two state variables instead of one has a significant effect on the reaction dynamics and renders the model capable to explain the dynamics of the convergence of the thermochemical cycles to a periodic steady state, observed experimentally in the previous work.

CMO QDs with average size of 2.0, 3.9, and 5.4 nm were selectively obtained at 80, 90, and 105 degrees C, respectively. The CMO QDs supported on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were employed as catalysts for the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) in alkaline solution to investigate their size-performance relationship. The results revealed that the amount of surface-adsorbed oxygen and the band gap energy, which affect the charge transfer in the oxygen electrocatalysis processes, strongly depend on the size of the CMO QDs. The CMO-3.9/CNT hybrid, consisting of CNT-supported CMO QDs of 3.9 nm size, possesses a moderate amount of surface-adsorbed oxygen, a lower band gap energy, and a larger charge carrier concentration, and exhibits the highest electrocatalytic activity among the hybrid materials investigated. Moreover, the CMO-3.9/CNT hybrid displays ORR and OER performances similar to those of the benchmark Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts, respectively, due to the strong carbon-oxide interactions and the high dispersion of CoMn2O4 QDs on the carbon substrate; this reveals the huge potential of the CMO-3.9/CNT hybrid as a bifunctional OER/ORR electrocatalyst. The present results highlight the importance of controlling the size of metal oxide nanodots in the design of active oxygen electrocatalysts based on spinel-type, nonprecious metal oxides.									40	6	0	0	1	0	40			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000413100400021

Herein, we show that an appropriate level of sulfur doping in oxide perovskites (such as LaCoO3, LaNiO3, and LaFeO3) can not only enhance the conductivity but also transform the spin state of Co (Ni, Fe) from low to intermediate spin and, therefore, give rise to much accelerated oxygen electrocatalytic activities. Sulfur-doped LaCoO3 (S-LCO) exhibits significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activities in both oxygen evolution reactions and oxygen reduction reactions, as confirmed by first principle calculations and experimental observation, where the potential rate-determining step is accelerated owing to the introduction of S-dopants and oxygen defects. At the optimized S-doping level, S-5.84%-LCO endows a rechargeable Zn-air battery with a high power density (92 mW/cm(2) at 144 mA/cm(2)), excellent stability of charge/recharge, and a large open-circuit voltage of 1.47 V. This study shows that the engineering of the electronic state of oxide perovskite by S-doping is an effective pathway leading to high-performing bifunctional catalysis for energy storage and conversion.									44	1	0	0	2	0	43			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000529878600013

However, their expense and unsatisfactory durability prevent their application as anode catalysts in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer stacks. This study presents the synthesis of various noble metal-free cobalt oxides supported on reduced graphene oxide catalysts using ultrasonic spray pyrolysis following different heat treatment processes. The catalyst prepared through additional thermal reduction and subsequent oxidation exhibits highly dispersed and Co3+ ion-rich hollow Co3O4 spheres on crumpled reduced graphene oxide sheets, thereby providing additional catalytically active sites for the OER.

In this study, oxygen vacancy-bearing CoO (CoO-A) has been successfully synthesized through a simple calcination of Co(Ac)(2).4H(2)O in Ar, and the oxygen vacancies have been confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, HRTEM, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS). In comparison with defect-free CoO-N, which is derived from the decomposition of Co(NO3)(2).6H(2)O, an oxygen-deficient CoO-A based cathode shows much higher cycling stability, higher rate capability, higher coulombic efficiency, and lower charge-discharge overpotential. The enhanced performances of the CoO-A based cathode can be largely attributed to the synergetic effect of CoO itself and oxygen vacancies on the promotion of both ORR and OER. CoO provides catalytic activity for ORR, and at the same time the oxygen vacancies not only facilitate the electron and Li+ migration but also act as active sites binding to O-2 and Li2O2, which accelerates the OER process. Furthermore, the formation and decomposition of Li2O2 during discharge-charge cycles have also been studied and the results indicate that CoO-A shows a high catalytic activity in the decomposition of Li2O2.									125	4	0	0	4	0	126			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000360049900013

Journal of colloid and interface science				627				215	223		10.1016/j.jcis.2022.07.060				2022-Dec	2022	Exploring highly active and inexpensive electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is considered to be one of the preconditions for the development of energy and environment-related technologies. Nickel-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are extensively-studied OER electrocatalysts, but they still require relatively high overpotentials to achieve threshold current densities. In this work, iron-doped nickel-vanadium hydroxide microspheres (Fe-doped NiV HMS) were synthesized by doping iron ions into the NiV HMS through a facile cation-exchange method. The Fe-doped NiV HMS are hollow hierarchical structure stacked by high-density perpendicularly-lying nanosheets, which provide enough space for electrolyte penetration and diffusion. Owing to optimized composition and hollow hierarchical structure, the Fe-doped NiV HMS exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance, which possessed a very low running overpotential (255mV at 10mAcm-2) and a smallest Tafel slope (56mV dec-1) compared with hierarchical NiV HMS toward OER. Electrochemical results and density functional theory (DFT) manifest that Fe doping could regulate the electronic structure of NiV HMS, thus improving its electrical conductivity and electron transfer rate, and thus enhancing its catalytic activity. This research provides a convenient way to prepare Ni-based hydroxides as promising OER catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1095-7103		MEDLINE:35849855	35849855

Herein, we report a NiFe carbonate hydroxides embedded in a carbon nanotubes and graphite composite material (NiFe CHs-CNT/G) by a facile and green precipitation method. The NiFe CHs are in-situ grown on CNT/G using NH3 center dot H2O as precipitant and CO2 in air as the source of CO32- under room temperature and pressure. The introduction of CNT/G not only improves the conductivity of material, but also enhances the combination of CNT/G and NiFe CHs nanosheets, thereby accelerating the transfer of electrons and reactants. Meanwhile, the catalyst with a special sandwich morphology provides larger active area to expose more active sites. Moreover, the effective interaction within the Ni and Fe in NiFe CHs-CNT/G is benefiting for improving OER performance. All these lead to the optimized NiFe CHs-CNT/G catalyst delivers an outstanding OER performance with a low overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 60.13 mV dec(-1).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000824434000001

Herein, we report an effective fabrication method for gold multipod nanoparticle (GMN) core-cobalt sulfide shell (GMN@CoxSy) nanostructures. The unique cagelike morphology is successfully acquired within nano-hybrids (GMN@CoxSy nanocages). The cobalt-based metal-organic frameworks can act as versatile sacrificial templates to the desired hybrid nanomaterials through solution-based etching approaches without any undesirable reshaping of GMNs, which are embedded within. Examination of the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of the prepared nanohybrids reveals that a type of GMN@CoxSy nanohybrid shows a substantially lower overpotential (eta) value (345 mV) compared with those of GMNs (617 mV) and CoxSy nanomaterials (418 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The enhanced OER performance is mainly attributed to the highly effective core-shell interfaces stemming from the unique multibranch topologies of the GMN cores as well as the optimized cobalt sulfide shells of the nanohybrids.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2574-0970			WOS:000469409900008

Herein, we demonstrate that a CoS2 nanoarray on Ti mesh (CoS2/TiM) behaves as an efficient and durable catalyst for the hydrazine oxidation reaction in 1.0 M KOH with 100 mM hydrazine, which requires the potential of 125 mV to achieve 100 mA cm(-2). The high hydrogen-evolving activity of CoS2/TiM makes it a bifunctional catalyst for energy-saving electrolytic hydrogen generation by replacing water oxidation with hydrazine oxidation. To drive 100 mA cm(-2), its two-electrode electrolyzer demands a low cell voltage of only 0.81 V and it exhibits remarkable long-term electrochemical durability and nearly 100% Faradic efficiency for hydrogen evolution.									56	3	0	0	1	0	56			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000403340100006

Herein, we prepared a hybrid iron and cobalt-based metal alloy phosphide on a phosphorus and nitrogen co-doped carbon substrate (FeCo-P/PNC) as a catalyst using a one-step Pregulation method. The catalyst exhibited a positive half-wave potential of 0.86 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for ORR, and low overpotentials of 350 and 158 mV for OER and HER, respectively, to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory calculations demonstrated the dominant role of P in both FeCo phosphide and carbon matrix, which led to the good ORR, OER and HER kinetics. The assembled aqueous and flexible Zn-air batteries with FeCo-P/PNC as the air cathode displayed excellent peak power densities of 195.1 and 90.8 mW cm(-2), respectively, as well as outstanding charging-discharging performance, long lifetime, and high flexibility. Moreover, the self-powered overall water-splitting cell exhibited a low working voltage of 1.71 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), confirming its excellent multifunctional OER/ORR/HER activity.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000743892300001

Herein, asphaltene-derived carbon-coated Fe-and N-doped hierarchical hollow porous carbon microtubes were prepared through feasible freeze-drying and carbonization/activation strategies. Cotton with a fibrous morphology acted as a soft template and carbon precursor, while asphaltene with easy graphitization properties was utilized to stabilize the structure of microtubes and accelerate the charge conductivity. Meanwhile, Fe-and N-doping changed the electronic structure of carbon and increased the number of active sites. In particular, the optimum sample displayed excellent OER activity with a lower overpotential of 261.4 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) and Tafel slope of 94.60 mV/dec under alkaline conditions. Moreover, the catalyst demonstrated excellent long-term durability with a 10% attenuation rate after continuous operation for 50 h by the chronoamperometry method at a constant potential of 1.5 V. This work provides a strategy for the effective resource utilization of biomass and asphaltene to prepare highly efficient OER electrocatalysts. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, alloy ribbons of non-precious metals as self-supported electrodes for OER electrocatalysts have rarely been reported. Here we report a melt-spinning method to prepare an Fe35Co20Ni20Mo20Si5 alloy ribbon, which serves as a self-supporting electrode OER electrocatalysts by dealloyed etching. The etching expands the active surface area of the alloy ribbon which increases the abundant active sites. The experimental results showed that the electronic structure of FeMoSi on the ribbons surface excellently facilitates the OER process. The electrocatalytic activity test showed that the etched alloy ribbon exhibited excellent OER activity in 1 M KOH alkaline solution, with an overpotential of only 260 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2, a Tafel slope as low as 37.9 mV dec-1 and a stability of up to 90 h without decay. This work serves as a promising guide for the use of alloy ribbons as a highly efficient and self-supported electrocatalyst.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0925-8388	1873-4669		WOS:000799773600003

We report in this paper a pyrochlore yttrium ruthenate (Y2Ru2O7-delta) electrocatalyst that has significantly enhanced performance toward OER in acid media over the best-known catalysts, with an onset overpotential of 190 mV and high stability in 0.1 M perchloric acid solution. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) indicates Y2Ru2O7-delta electrocatalyst had a low valence state that favors the high OER activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation shows this pyrochlore has lower band center energy for the overlap between Ru 4d and O 2p orbitals and is therefore more stable Ru-O bond than RuO2, highlighting the effect of yttrium on the enhancement in stability. The Y2Ru2O7-delta pyrochlore is also free of expensive iridium metal and thus is a cost-effective candidate for practical applications.									216	10	0	0	20	0	219			0002-7863			WOS:000409286000063	28749136

In the present work, a facile and fast colloid assisted ethylene glycol (EG) combustion synthesis strategy was developed to prepare mesoporous manganese cobaltate (MnCo2O4) with a large specific surface area (SSA). The as-prepared MnCo2O4 delivered a high SSA of 124.4 m(2) g(-1) with hierarchical mesopores in the range of 3-30 nm. It offered short diffusion paths and rich active sites, which can promote the OER catalytic activity. When applied as the electrocatalyst for OER, the mesoporous MnCo2O4 demonstrated an ultra-low overpotential of 0.24 V at 10 mA cm(-2), and a moderate Tafel slope with robust durability. This work not only puts forward a novel synthetic route towards mesoporous MnCo2O4 with high SSA but also reveals its tremendous prospects in the field of electrocatalytic water oxidation.

Herein, an elaborately designed 3D hierarchical heterostructure comprising NiCo2S4@NiO core-shell arrays on conductive carbon paper is first reported as a freestanding cathode for Li-O-2 batteries. The unique hierarchical array structures can build up multidimensional channels for oxygen diffusion and electrolyte impregnation. A built-in interfacial potential between NiCo2S4 and NiO can drastically enhance interfacial charge transfer kinetics. According to density functional theory calculations, intrinsic LiO2-affinity characteristics of NiCo2S4 and NiO play an importantly synergistic role in promoting the formation of large peasecod-like Li2O2, conducive to construct a low-impedance Li2O2/cathode contact interface. As expected, Li-O-2 cells based on NiCo2S4@NiO electrode exhibit an improved overpotential of 0.88 V, a high discharge capacity of 10 050 mAh g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1), an excellent rate capability of 6150 mAh g(-1) at 1.0 A g(-1), and a long-term cycle stability under a restricted capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1).

Here, an efficient in situ electrochemical reconstructed CoFe-hydroxides derived OER electrocatalyst was reported. The introduction of Fe promoted the transformation of Co2+ into Co3+ in CoFe-hydroxides nanosheet, along with the formation of abundant amorphous/crystalline interfaces. Thanks for the retained nanosheet microstructure, high valence Co3+ and Fe3+ species, and the amorphous/crystalline heterostructure interfaces, the as-designed electrochemical reconstructed CoFeOOH nanosheet/Ni foam (CoFeOOHNS/NF) electrode delivers 100 mA.cm(-2) in alkaline at an overpotential of 275 mV and can stably electrocatalyze water oxidation for at least 35 h at 100 mA.cm(-2). Meanwhile, the alkaline full water splitting electrolyzer achieves a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) only at 1.522 V for CoFeOOHNS/NFIIPt/C/NF, which is much lower than that of Ru/C/NFIIPt/C/NF (1.655 V@10 mA.cm(-2)).

The Cu3P/FeP heterostructure serves as a good catalyst because it possesses abundant interfaces between Cu3P and FeP, which enables the exposure of electrocatalytically active sites and tuning of surface electronic configurations. Additionally, the presence of strong heterointerfaces between Cu3P and FeP, and the integration of the P-doped carbon guarantee the high electrical conductivity of the catalyst. Benefiting from these advantages, the Cu3P/FeP electrode exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which presents a low overpotential of 315 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, thus outperforming that of the state-of-the-art RuO2. In addition, the Cu3P/FeP hybrid composite exhibited long-term stability for 50 h. This work provides a new strategy for the design and preparation of transition-metal-based heterostructures and facilitates the development of high-performance energy-related materials.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the RDS for the oxygen evolution reaction driven by transition metal hydroxides/oxides, i.e., surface adsorption of (OH-/OOH center dot) species, can be significantly promoted by increasing the electrophilicity of electrocatalysts via hybridization with electron-withdrawing inorganic nanosheets. As predicted by DFT calculation, the hybridization of Ni-Fe-layered double hydroxide (LDH)/Ni-Co-LDH, with RuO2 nanosheets (1.0 wt%) leads to significant lowering of the overpotentials to 207/276 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), i.e., one of the smallest overpotentials for LDH-based materials, with the increase in the current density. The necessity of a very small amount of RuO2 nanosheets (1.0 wt%) to optimize the electrocatalyst activity highlights the remarkably high efficiency of the RuO2 addition. The present study underscores the importance of kinetic control of the RDS via hybridization with electron-withdrawing species for exploring novel efficient electrocatalysts.									41	1	0	0	1	0	41			1884-4049	1884-4057		WOS:000442471900001

Here heterogeneous Co@CoO encapsulated in P, N codoped carbon nanofibers supported on carbon cloth (Co@CoO-PNC/CC) has been prepared to pursue attractive synergism for the application of pH-tolerant catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in both alkaline and neutral solutions. The prepared Co@CoO-PNC/CC exhibits advanced OER performances, generating a current density of 10 mA cm & minus;2 at overpotential of 289 mV in alkaline media and 371 mV in neutral media. The high OER activity can be assigned to the synergistic effect of abundant active sites and enhanced charge transfer between Co and CoO, as well as the specific P, N co-doped carbon nanofiber architecture.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we found that construction of hierarchical nanostructures and heteroatom doping are two effective strategies to enhance the catalytic properties of transition-metal phosphides (TMPs) toward alkaline OER. We successfully synthesized a heteroatom Mn-doped CoP catalyst (denoted as Mn-CoP), which presents hierarchical microspheres assembled with porous nanosheets, through sequential solvothermal, thermal annealing in air, and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes. The doping of Mn can simultaneously regulate the morphology of the hierarchical microsphere nanostructure and modulate the electron structure of CoP. Remarkably, only 285 mV overpotential was needed to reach 10 mA cm(-2) of the Mn-CoP catalyst in alkaline conditions, largely outperforming the commercial RuO2 (330 mV). Besides, during the continuous 50 h chronoamperometry test, the Mn-CoP catalyst exhibits great stability and robustness. In short, this study provides a facile solution for designing and achieving high-efficiency and cost-effective nano-electrocatalysts in water splitting.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14				2574-0970		WOS:000595546500017

Here, we report a novel Fe doped CoP nanocuboid (CoxFe1-xP) via the successive oxidation and phosphidation of the Co-Fe precursor strategy. By preparation and measurement of the control samples, the optimized Co0.8Fe0.2P is found, affording an overpotential of 285 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), yielding a Tafel slope of 40 mV dec(-1), and endowing robust stability for 10 h with only 5.78% degradation. The outstanding OER performance should be ascribed to the redistribution of the electron spin status via pi-donation due to the introduction of Fe into the CoP lattices, enabling optimization of the adsorption/desorption feature of the intermediate species on the catalyst surface. This work paves the ways for exploration of high efficient catalysts with deliberate electron spin tailoring. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, the non-noble metal Co is successfully doped into the surface layer of ZnO and the doping concentration can be controllably adjusted by a partial cation exchange method. Our experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the surface-doped Co can not only activate the inherently inert Zn sites by modifying their electronic structure and thereby promoting the OH* adsorption but also serve as active sites themselves for the adsorption of O* and OOH*, ultimately realizing the bimetallic synergetic effect in Co/ZnO for OER catalysis. Besides, the surface Co doping also benefits the obvious enhancement of electrical conductivity of the ZnO host. Therefore, relative to the inactive ZnO, the as-prepared Co/ZnO exhibits a much smaller overpotential and Tafel slope toward OER This strategy provides a rational design of low-cost and efficient OER electrocatalysts.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2168-0485			WOS:000494894200055

The morphology of these oxides is influenced by the difference in the structure of bqbenzo2-{3,4-bis(2-quinolinecarboxamido) benzophenone and, bqb2-{bis(2-quinolinecarboxamido)-1,2benzen}, only differing in a benzoyl substituent. The products were characterized by XRD, FE-SEM, and FT-IR spectroscopy. The catalytic activity of the oxides was examined in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The Co3O4 oxides (1 and 2) exhibited higher catalytic activity compared to 10 wt% Pt/C in terms of obtained current density at 0.8 V; similar to 23.3 versus 6.1 mA cm(-2), respectively. However, the aging tests of the two oxides in OER revealed that Co3O4 (1) is more stable than Co3O4 (2). These results demonstrated that the Co3O4 (1) has a superior performance which can be employed in the alkaline water electrolyzer anode.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000399162500005

Herein, a one-step synthesis of high-valence nickel-doped CeO2-x covered with FeOOH nanosheets in the presence of Ni2+/Fe3+ is reported. A series of ex situ and in situ experiments reveal the etching effect on ceria of the H+ species from the hydrolysis of Fe3+, which induces substitutional doping of Ni2+ ions into the etched sites and their further oxidation to the high-valance Ni3+/Ni4+ by coupling to the Ce4+/Ce3+ pair in the oxygen-vacancy-rich CeO2-x. Concomitantly, Fe3+ is deposited on the surface of ceria as FeOOH nanosheets. The dispersed high-valent Ni3+/Ni4+ coupled with the decorated FeOOH nanosheets on CeO2-x leads to efficient OER electrocatalysis with a low overpotential of 195 mV cm(-2) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.99 s(-1), which, to the best of the authors' knowledge represents the best Ce-containing OER catalyst reported to date, and comparable to other top OER catalysts. This work opens an avenue for engineering high-valence metal ions in an oxide matrix for the OER or other oxidation reactions.									58	1	0	0	2	0	58			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000600502700001

Herein, the heterointerface between Fe(Cr)OOH and Fe3O4 is constructed through a scalable method. Systematic experiments and theoretical calculations confirmed that the Fe(Cr)OOH coupling with Fe3O4 can significantly decrease the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential (eta 500 = 241 mV in 1 M KOH) and promote the mass and electron transfer. Impressively, this electrode could work efficiently and maintain 100 mA cm-2 for 100 h in both alkaline seawater and domestic sewage. The electrolyzer using such electrode as anode could deliver a current density of 500 mA cm-2 in 5 M KOH at a small cell voltage of 1.62 V. This work provides a facile route to prepare efficient and low-cost OER catalysts, which has important implications for energy conversion.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000720459700004

In this work, creating active sites while accelerating charge transport is proposed to improve the OER properties of MOF-derived layered double hydroxides (MLDH). By using multifunctional Ti3C2 MXene as support and post-treating MOF with an etching-coprecipitating process, the resultant CoFe MLDH/Ti3C2 exhibits prominent OER performance with ultralow overpotentials of only 170 and 238 mV to achieve the current density of 10 and 100 mA/cm2, respectively. In addition, the experimental and theoretical calculation results prove the strong electronic interaction between CoFe MLDH and Ti3C2 MXene could modulate the binding strength of intermediates for OER.

The strategy has two essential components: a set of multifidelity features (e.g., composition and electronic structure) and probabilistic models with Gaussian processes trained with ab initio data for predicting activity descriptors (i.e., *O and *OH adsorption energies). By iteratively validating/refining the candidates which have theoretical overpotentials <0.5 V, albeit with large uncertainties, we attain machine learning models (RMSE < 0.5 eV) that can rapidly navigate through a chemical subspace of similar to 4000 double perovskites (AA'B2O6) and single out stable structures with promising OER activity. Our approach successfully identified several known perovskites with improved catalytic performance over the benchmark LaCoO3 along with 10 other candidates that have not been reported. Importantly, by analyzing the feature distributions of better and worse catalysts than LaCoO3, we draw molecular orbital insights into physical factors governing the OER activity.									34	1	0	0	4	0	34			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000040

The pyrolysis of PCPZs that supported on monodispersed silica spheres produced high-surface graphitized carbons (N,P-GCs) with abundant surface N-P coupling sites. The N,P-GCs were demonstrated as efficient metal-free electro-catalysts for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The pore structures of these carbons for exposing more active sites could be adjusted by importing varisized SiO2 spheres (10-50 nm) as hard templates. Typically, N, PGC-1000 using 30 nm SiO2 as templates exhibits the ORR half-wave potential of 0.85 V in 0.1 M KOH solution, with a loading density of 0.35 mg cm(-2) on the electrodes, which is comparable to commercial PVC catalyst (0.1 mg cm(-2), 20 wt%, JM). Moreover, the OER over N, P-GC-1000 electrodes (0.65 mg cm(-2)) could also reach 10 mA cm(-2) current density at a lower potential of 1.56 V, close to typical RuO2 electrode (1.59 V, 0.2 mg cm(-2), Premetek).

In this study, we report a facile synthesis of FeCoNiCuIr high-entropy alloy nanoparticles (HEA NPs) by a one-step heat-up method. The involvement of glucose made the NPs grow uniformly and increased the valence of Ir.

In addition, high stability has also been observed, which remained at 94.2% of the current density after 10 h constant electrolysis, with a constant current of 10 mA cm(-2). The high electrocatalytic activity and stability are ascribed to the cocktail effect and synergistic effect between the constituent elements.

Herein, we show that nickel (Ni) and iron (Fe) dual doping activates the electrochemical inert W18O49 into a highly active electrocatalyst toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Compared to monodoping, dual doping of Ni and Fe in the lattice of W18O49 results in the synergistic modulation of the electronic structure and physicochemical properties of tungsten oxides. The Ni and Fe dual-doped W18O49 (NiFe-W18O49) achieves a low overpotential of 325 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). and a Tafel slope of 42 mV deC(-1) for the OER in 0.1 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution, comparable with those of state-of-the-art IrO2. The Zn-air battery based on a NiFe-W18O49 cathode displays a long-term cycling durability of over 180 h, superior to the battery with a commercial Pt/C-IrO2 cathode. Combined experimental analysis and density functional theory calculations unveil that the distorted geometric structure and regulated electronic structure of W18O49 contribute crucially to the activation of its inert catalytic activity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000813033600001

In this work, Fe doped metal organic frameworks (Ni)/carbon black composites were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. Benefiting from the direct use of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) for OER, numerous and highly dispersed active sites are exposed to the electrolyte and reactants. By regulating Ni/Fe ratios, a high electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) and high relative surface content of active Ni3+ species are obtained, which mainly contribute to the high OER activity. Besides, the introduced carbon black (CB) was found to enhance the charge-transfer efficiency of the electrocatalysts, which is also favorable for OER. The optimal Ni9Fe1-BDC-0.15CB electrocatalyst shows excellent OER activity with the low overpotential of similar to 290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and the Tafel slope of similar to 76.1 mV dec(-1), which is comparable to RuO2 and other MOFs-based OER electrocatalysts reported in recent years.

In this study, ultrathin nanoporous CuCo2O4 nanosheets are synthesized on a nickel foam substrate using electrodeposition followed by air annealing. The CuCo2O4 nanosheet electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1473 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) with a capacity retention of similar to 93% after 5000 cycles in 3M KOH solution. It also works well as an efficient oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst, demonstrating an overpotential of 260 mV m 20 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of similar to 64 mV dec(-1). in 1 M KOH solution, which is the lowest reported among other copper-cobalt based transition metal oxide catalysts. The catalyst is very stable > 20 mA cm(-2) for more than 25 h. The superior electrochemical performance of the CuCo2O4 nanosheet electrode is due to the synergetic effect of the direct growth of 2D nanosheet structure and a large electrochemically active surface area associated with nanopores on the CuCo2O4 nanosheet surface.									64	1	0	0	6	0	64			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000454997100042

Here we present an experimentally innovative strategy on comprehensively efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) utilizing plasmon-induced activated water, creating from hot electron decay at resonantly illuminated Au nanoparticles (NPs). Compared to conventional deionized (DI) water, the created water owns intrinsically reduced hydrogen-bonded structure and a higher chemical potential. The created water takes an advantage in OER because the corresponding activation energy can be effectively reduced by itself. Compared to DI water-based solutions, the OER efficiencies at Pt electrodes increased by 69.3%, 21.1% and 14.5% in created water-based acidic, neutral and alkaline electrolyte solutions, respectively. The created water was also effective for OERs in photoelectrochemically catalytic and in inert systems. In addition, the efficiency of OER increased by 47.5% in created water-based alkaline electrolyte solution prepared in situ on a roughened Au electrode. These results suggest that the created water has emerged as an innovative activator in comprehensively effective OERs.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			2045-2322			WOS:000378575200002	27328821

They are synthesized by a simple hydrothermal reaction using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and polyvinyl pyrrolidone as dispertants and pretectants. With the help of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), the Co-3(VO4)(2)-MNs and Co-3(VO4)(2)-UPNs were immobilized respectivtly onto the surface of glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs). By comparison, the GCE-Co-3(VO4)(2)-MN/MWCNT exhibits higher performance of OER electrocatalysis and better stablity than the GCE-Co-3(VO4)(2)-UPN/MWCNT in the alkali electrolyte of 1 M KOH due to its higher surface roughness. The high surface free energy of Co-3(VO4)(2)-MNs is helpful for their immobilization on elelctrode surface, leading a better stability. The work shows that the noble metal-free electrocatalysts can lower the energy barrier and improve the energy efficiency for electrochemical water splitting to generate hydrogen.

Transition metals are ideal candidates because of their high abundance, impressive activities, and easy accessibility. However, a facile method leading to improved performance and stability is still needed. Herein, a highly efficient carbon-encapsulated bimetal catalyst derived from Ni-based metal-organic-frameworks (MOF) was successfully prepared through the low-temperature (350 degrees C) pyrolysis of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) precursors under H-2/Ar atmosphere. Cube-structured PBA as template and precursor , parameters during the pyrolysis process including temperature and calcination atmosphere can be tuned to control the structure and properties of the catalysts. Benefiting from the porous three-dimensional (3D) cubic structure and abundant defect-rich amorphous N-doped carbon shell, Ni3Fe@NC-350 exhibits excellent OER activity. The as-prepared catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic performance for OER in 1.0 M KOH with an overpotential of 237 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2). More importantly, the presented catalyst has an extremely good durability. (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0925-8388	1873-4669		WOS:000833271900001

A group of electrochemical tests showed that the OER performance of beta-Ni(OH)(2)/PPy hybrid was the best when the amount of pyrrole content was 50 mu L with the C-dl being 2.31 mF cm(-2), the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) being 57.75 cm(2) , the overpotential being 461 mV, and the Tafel slope being 89 mV dec(-1). In addition, beta-Ni(OH)(2)/PPy (50 mu L) exhibited the higher TOF, lower R-ct, and better stability as compared to other as-prepared composites. These results illustrate that PPy can effectively improve the electrical conductivity of beta-Ni(OH)(2) material and prevent the aggregation of beta-Ni(OH)(2) /PPy composite, which leads to more exposed active sites and facilitates the electronic transmission of OER. Therefore, the combination of the two as a catalyst has a good development prospect for water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000824278100001

Herein, the sulfate-intercalated CoFe LDH nanosheets were successfully fabricated at ambient temperature via a facile strategy, using two-dimensional ZIF-9(III) as a template and FeSO4 as both etchant and iron source. When the as-prepared sulfate-intercalated CoFe LDH acts as an electrocatalyst, it presents superior electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), requiring low overpotential (eta@10 mA cm(-2) = 218 mV) with a small Tafel slope of 59.9 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH, which compares favorably with commercial RuO2 and most reported transition-metal electrocatalysts. The high catalytic activity of CoFe LDH might be ascribed to the large interlayer space distance originating from special SO42- ions and the strong synergistic effects between Fe and Co. This work provides a novel and feasible approach to designing highly efficient electrocatalysts based on advanced LDH materials for OER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2073-4344		WOS:000832459600001

The crystal structure of the Co particles was adjusted by post-treatments with H2O2, ethanol vapor, and H-2, which result in Co3O4, CoO, and metallic Co phases, respectively. After these different treatments, the composite materials consist of small Co-based nanoparticles with an average crystallite size of 6-14 nm supported on activated carbon with apparent specific surface areas up to 1065 m(2) g(-1). Correlations between the structure of the materials and their activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were established, whereby the post-treatment with ethanol vapor was found to yield the most effective electrocatalyst. The material shows good stability at 10 mA cm(-2) over 10 h and reaches a mass activity of 2.9 A mg(Co)(-1), which is even higher than pristine ordered mesoporous Co3O4. The superior electrocatalytic performance is ascribed to a high dispersion of Co-based nanoparticles and the conductivity of the activated carbon that facilitate the charge transport.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000674252800001

To date, it is very urgent to explore new methods to prepare amorphous electrocatalysts. Herein, we use a simple approach to construct amorphous Co-based selenite electrocatalyst by mechanical ball milling for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Due to its amorphous structure as well as more active species, the obtained amorphous cobalt selenite C4S-12 h material on the glassy carbon electrode shows superior electrochemical performance with a low overpotential of 255 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. In addition, this catalyst also has an excellent intrinsic activity (high mass activity of 162.0 A g(-1) and TOF of 0.063 s(-1) at the overpotential of 350 mV) and remarkable long-term stability (at least 32 h at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)).

Herein, we successfully prepared CoSx nanoparticles loaded onto N-doped carbon spheres to form unique CoSx/NCS nanocomposites, showing good trifunctional activities for ORR, OER and HER. As the cathodic electrocatalyst in Zn-air battery, the CoSx/NCS shows a lower charge voltage of 2.1 V and a high power density of 72.7 mW cm(-2) compared to Pt/C. CoSx/NCS also shows potentials in overall water splitting as the OER and HER electrocatalysts. The onset potential and overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) toward overall water splitting reaches 1.70 V and 1.83 V, respectively. The enhanced activity of CoSx/NCS should be ascribed to the synergistic effects of improved surface hydrophilicity, CoN sites, pyridinic-N species, and Co-S bonds. This study provides a new strategy to synthesize active electrocatalysts with multiple functions in energy conversion and storage.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			0025-5408	1873-4227		WOS:000518870000019

A chelating agent introduced into the media was thought to increase the concentration of metal hydroxide nuclei and suppress excessive growth of the LDH crystal, resulting in the synthesis of nanometer-sized LDH. The NiFe-LDH catalyzed the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at an overpotential of 247 mV and current of 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to the performance of conventional iridium oxide (IrOx) catalysts. Notably, a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) for anion exchange membrane water electrolysis using NiFe-LDH as an anode catalyst exhibited an energy conversion efficiency of 74.7% for flowing 1.0 A cm(-2) in 1 M KOH at 80 degrees C.

Enhancing the efficiency of water splitting indispensably requires stable and high-efficiency electrocatalysts for OER. The OER activity of electrocatalysts can be largely heightened by well adjusting their energy level and active sites. Herein, the amorphous iron cobalt molybdenum carbonate hydroxide core-shell microspheres (FeCoMo/CoMo) offer significant opportunities to improve the OER activity in both thermodynamics and kinetics due to the appropriate matching of the energy level with the equilibrium potential of OER and the abundant active sites.The well-designed Fe-0.25-CoMoCH/NF sample exhibits prominent activity toward OER with an overpotential as low as 232 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 46 mV dec(-1), and excellent stability in alkaline solution. Mechanistic studies using a rotating ringdisk electrode confirm the four-electron pathway with high faradaic efficiency (97.7%) toward OER.

Cobaltites MxCo3-xO4 (M= Ni, Cu, Zn, Mn; x=1 or 0.9) are synthesized by the coprecipitation method and characterized for the OER performance. Cyclic voltammetric measurement confirms that the cobaltites exhibit different redox characteristic for Co cation couples. NiCo2O4 and MnCo2O4 show the redox couple of Co(III)/Co(II) during OER, while for ZnCo2O4 and Cu0.9Co2.1O4 are Co(IV)/Co(III). OER measurement reveals that all these cobaltite spinel electrodes show better performance than metal Ni electrode. And ZnCo2O4 shows the best performance for OER with the highest current density of 205mAcm(-2) at potential of 0.7V. XPS result verifies that the cobaltites have the different surface Co cations distribution. The analysis discovers that the amount of the surface Co cations occupying the octahedral sites in spinel is crucial for OER performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the anodic sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) always needs high overpotential and thus brings about superfluous electricity cost of water electrolysis. Therefore, exploiting highly efficient OER electrocatalysts with small overpotential especially at high current density will undoubtedly boost the development of industrial water electrolysis. Herein, we used a simple hydrothermal method to prepare a novel FeOOH-CoS nanocomposite on nickel foam (NF). The as-prepared FeOOH-CoS/NF catalyst displays an excellent OER performance with extremely low overpotentials of 306 and 329 mV at 500 and 1000 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. In addition, the FeOOH-CoS/NF catalyst can maintain excellent catalytic stability for more than 50 h, and the OER catalytic activity shows almost no attenuation no matter after 1000 repeated CV cycles or 50 h of stability test. The high catalytic activity and stability have exceeded most non-noble metal elec-trocatalysts reported in literature, which makes the FeOOH-CoS/NF composite catalyst have promising applications in the industrial water electrolysis.

This requires a thorough understanding of various characteristics of an electrocatalyst that can influence its performance. Layered hydroxides, such as beta-Co(OH)(2), are promising OER electrocatalysts; however, they tend to transform to the CoOOH phase during synthesis. In this work, we have evaluated the influence of the oxyhydroxide impurity phase on the OER activity of two-dimensional beta-Co(OH)(2). Our study reveals that the CoOOH impurity in beta-Co(OH)(2) nanosheets improves the thermodynamics of OER (overpotentials of 322 and 369 mV at a 10 mA.cm(-2) current density in the presence and absence of impurity), while adversely impacting the reaction kinetics (Tafel slopes of 142.3 and 96.5 mV.dec(-1), respectively). These concurrent synergistic and antagonistic behaviors of the CoOOH phase are interesting and emphasize the importance of well-controlled synthesis conditions and thorough catalyst characterization to develop sustainable catalytic technologies.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2574-0970		WOS:000844337100001

Herein, a Co0.76Fe0.18Mo0.06O1.35 catalyst with a spinel structure (CFMO-800) was prepared from Mo-doped LaCo0.8Fe0.2O3 perovskites (LCF) by a simple exsolution method. The CFMO-800 catalyst exhibited a low potential of 1.48 V (vs. RHE) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH surpassing all spinel and perovskite Co/Fe oxide catalysts reported. The surface-sensitive soft X-ray absorption spectroscopies (SXAS) at the Co-L-2,L-3 and the O-K edges revealed an unexpected increase in the Co valence state of CFMO-800 upon doped with the high-valence Mo and the clear formation of Co/Fe (oxyhydr)oxides on the surface layers of the exsolved catalyst.

The porous carbon with a large surface area provides a favorable transport environment for the electrons and ions in the electrolyte. Co9S8/CoS nanoparticles and S doping may reduce the Ohmic series resistance (R-s) and charge transfer resistance (R-ct) of the electrocatalysts. The prepared Co-1.8/NC-0.3 composite shows excellent electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a low overpotential of 180 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and high durability in 1 M KOH solution. The R-ct and R-s values of Co-1.8/NC-0.3 are 5.01 x 10(-6) and 1.72 Omega. The lowest R-ct indicates that the catalysts has lower resistance and more OER activities at the electrode/electrolyte interface in comparison with the other catalyst.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			0022-3697	1879-2553		WOS:000586405300043

The resulting alpha-Co(OH)(2) materials are nanosheets with an average thickness of similar to 2.5 nm and the size in micrometers. Benefiting from the ultrathin thickness, this alpha-Co(OH)(2) nanosheet exhibits excellent oxygen evolution reaction performance with an overpotential of 267 mV at j = 10 mA cm(-2). This strategy can be applied to prepare other 2D Co-based layered double or triple hydroxides. Therefore, this work provides new strategies to prepare a series of 2D hydroxide nanosheets with solvent engineering and coordination competition.									35	1	0	0	0	0	35			2168-0485			WOS:000458086100073

Here, we used density functional theory calculations, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), and microkinetic simulations to explore the CO oxidation reactions via Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H), Eley-Rideal (E-R), and Mars-Van Krevelen (MvK) mechanisms on O-IrO2 (110) surface. We find that the C-O coupling and CO2 desorption are the rate-determining steps in L-H and E-R mechanisms, respectively. The CO oxidation via the MvK mechanism on the IrO2 (1 1 0) surface is more difficult to proceed. Both AIMD and microkinetic simulation results demonstrate that CO2 can desorb from the O-IrO2 (110) surface at 400 K. The production temperature of CO2 on the O-rich IrO2 (1 1 0) surface via E-R mechanism is lower than that via the L-H mechanism. Therefore, we predict that the O-rich IrO2 (110) surface can accelerate the CO oxidation reaction rate.									4	1	0	0	1	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000594833300003

Nickel-iron (NiFe)-based compounds have attracted significant attention as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts due to their high catalytic activity. We develop a simple and easily controlled method by combining anodic fluoridation and cyclic voltammetry (CV) treatment to convert NiFe alloy to Ni/Fe hydroxide. A cracked layer structure of Ni/Fe hydroxide formed on the surface during the fluoridation of NiFe alloy and the CV process in KOH. The Ni/Fe hydroxide exhibits considerable OER activity with an onset potential of 1.47 V vs. RHE and a Tafel slope of 47 mV dec(-1) in 0.1 M KOH. The electrode also shows an acceptable stability in alkaline media. The results indicate that anodic fluoridation and CV treatment are promising methods to form active layer structures of hydroxide on transition metals and their alloys, further increasing the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000869119100001

Herein, we develop a simple metal organic frameworks (MOFs) based approach to prepare bifunctional Co-NC@Mo2C complex catalysts. Differently from traditional carbon encapsulated functional nanomaterials, herein the carbon-based framework derived carbonitride and Co nanoparticles (Co-NC) are encapsulated with Mo2C. Benefiting from the unique reverse-encapsulation structure and synergetic effects of Mo2C and Co-NC, the Co-NC@Mo2C catalyst shows superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. In alkaline media, it affords the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 99 mV and 347 mV for HER and OER, respectively. Interestingly, due to a reversed encapsulation structure where Co nanoparticles are protected by Mo2C, it leads to an outstanding HER catalytic activity (a low overpotential of 143 mV) and stability in acidic solutions. Remarkably, when employed as both the cathode and anode for overall water splitting, a low cell voltage of 1.685 V is required to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media with excellent stability, making the Co-NC@Mo2C an efficient non noble metal bifunctional electrocatalyst toward water splitting.									236	13	0	0	13	0	236			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000458419000079

Herein, we creatively report NiFeOOH is greatly activated by N-doping to get an efficient OER catalyst. The effect of N-doping in the resulted metal oxyhydroxides for the OER is revealed for the first time. N-doped NiFeOOH (N-NiFeOOH) is in-situ derived from N-(NiFe)(3)S-2 precatalyst by electrochemical oxidation. N-NiFeOOH exhibits superior performance with a low overpotential of 278 mV at the current density of 100 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 35.3 mV dec(-1), which is comparable to the most excellent non-noble catalysts. DFT calculations reveal that N-doping would lower the d-band center of the surface metal atoms and in turn increase the adsorption ability of *OH on NiFeOOH, thereby reducing the OER overpotential. The key role of N-doping in the NiFeOOH for enhancing OER performance is reported for the first time, which will shed light on the design of catalysts. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Their electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media is presented. The Cu content was determined (0.05 <= x <= 0.2) by X-ray diffraction. A thorough powder neutron diffraction study was carried out to identify the subtle changes caused by copper substitution in the structure of NiTiO3. The evolution of the optical and magnetic properties with the Cu content was also investigated on the raw micrometer-sized particles. A reduction in particle size down to approximate to 15 nm was achieved by ball-milling the raw powder prepared by the solid-state reaction. The best catalytic activity for OER was obtained for nanometer-sized particles of Ni0.8Cu0.2TiO3 drop-tasted on the Cu plate. For this electrode, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen production was generated at 345 and 470 mV applied overpotentials with 1 and 0.1 M NaOH solutions as electrolytes, respectively. The catalyst retained this OER activity at 10 mA cm(-2) for long-term electrolysis with a faradic efficiency of 90% for O-2 production in a 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000484073400058	31379151

Cu2O nanoparticles enclosed with different crystal facets, namely, o-Cu2O NPs with {111} facets, c-Cu2O NPs with {100} facets are prepared and their electrocatalytic properties for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline condition are evaluated at single nanoparticle level with a combination of scanning electrochemical cell microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. It is found that the o-Cu2O NPs have significantly superior OER electrocatalytic activity compared to c-Cu2O, which is almost inert. The estimated turnover frequency (TOF) at 1.97 V vs. RHE on {111} facet increases from 4 s(-1) to 115 s(-1) with the octahedron edge length decreasing from 1.3 mu m to 100 nm. Deposition of carbon on c-Cu2O surface barely promotes the activity, suggesting the inherent poor electric conductivity within the nanocrystal is most likely the reason for low activity. This work provides direct probing to single transition metal oxide crystals with dramatically different activity.

Recently, 3d transition metal based OER catalysts become very attractive due to their abundant earth reserve and low price. However, these transition metals still suffer from severe dissolution problem and inappropriate adsorption ability to the intermediate species during OER catalysis. Herein, we prepared Mn and Co co-decorated Ni composites nanosheets (MnCo@NiS) via a facile step-by-step electrodeposition way, which showed near-optimal adsorption energy to oxygenated intermediates and much better electrocatalytic OER performance than single metal decorated NiS or non-decorated one, especially requiring a low OER overpotential of only 286 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline electrolyte and Tafel slope of 31.5 mV dec(-1). The results indicated Mn and Co co-decoration is very efficient way to change the electron distribution and optimize the adsorption energy of NiS, leading to the high OER performance. In particular, the MnCo@NiS electrode demonstrates a highly impressive stability with not only much less cation dissolution but negligible degradation after 20 h durability test at 50 mA cm(-2).									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000619132600007

However, few strategies were concerned on the effect of the MOF oxidation on the OER activity. Herein, using Co-MOF-74 as a model material, we elucidated that it is the cobalt on the oxidized MOF playing the role of active sites rather than pristine Co sites in Co-MOF-74. Strong evidence was shown that the redox process on Co sites in Co-MOF-74 occurred completely at potentials lower than that of OER taking place, accompanying with the collapse of CoMOF-74 structure. Based on this, polydopamine (PDA) was used to modify Co-MOF-74 to promote the oxidation of Co sites to enhance the OER performance. Furthermore, the structure of Co-MOF-74 was well maintained by enwrapping PDA. As a result, the PDA enwrapped catalyst (PDA-MOF-0.1) exhibited a higher OER activity and an improved stability compared to pure Co-MOF-74.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000805290800002

The oxidative environment restructures the studied material in the near-surface region, creating cavities in which agglomerates of IrOx(OH)(y)(SO4)(z) particles are incorporated. These in situ generated particles result from the oxidation of secondary phases in the matrix as well as from self-controlled near-surface oxidation of the ternary compound itself. The oxidation is controlled by the structural and chemical bonding features of Hf2B2Ir5. The cage-like motif, exhibiting mostly ionic interactions between positively charged Hf atoms and a covalently bonded Ir-B network, selectively controls the extent and kinetics of the transformation process induced during the operation of the electrocatalyst. The resulting self-optimized composite material, formed by a Hf2B2Ir5 matrix surrounding IrOx(OH)(y)(SO4)(z) particles, was used in the OER over 240 h at 100 mA cm(-2) current density. The chemical changes, as well as the OER performance, were studied via a combination of bulk- and surface-sensitive experimental techniques as well as by employing a quantum-chemical bonding analysis.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2574-0962			WOS:000595488500080

Transition-metal phosphides have been proved as promising OER catalysts. Herein, we fabricated P-functionalized Ni-Fe nanocomposites as an efficient OER catalyst using phosphorus-accumulating organisms (PAOs; a type of bacteria with a high content of phosphorus) as the phosphorus source and carbon precursors. The Ni-Fe nanoparticles were highly dispersed on the carbon matrix due to the polyphosphate-confined effect of nickel and iron ions. The prepared P-functionalized Ni-Fe nanocomposites required an overpotential of only 268 mV on a glassy carbon electrode and only 137 mV on nickel foam to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER, values much lower than those of currently reported NiFe-based OER catalysts. The high catalytic activity of the P-functionalized Ni-Fe nanocomposites was ascribed to good dispersion of Ni and Fe, facile electron transfer, enhanced conductivity and wettability. Therefore, this work provides an efficient and low-cost OER electrocatalyst for practical application.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2168-0485			WOS:000558728500044

However, the selective electrochemical anodic oxygen evolution reaction from seawater is challenging because of the competitive chloride oxidation reaction as well as anodic corrosion. Here we report an FeOOH deposited beta-Ni-Co hydroxide as a new active material with an outer graphene oxide layer, which works effectively for selective overall alkaline natural seawater splitting, which requires very low cell voltages of 1.57 and 2.02 V to reach current densities of 20 mA cm(-2) and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively, at 27 degrees C. Importantly, this electrolyzer shows exceptional stability for more than 378 h at a current density of 1 A cm(-2). This discovery can be generalized with other reported unstable OER/HER seawater splitting electrocatalysts, which can significantly progress the expansion of seawater electrolysis for extensive hydrogen production.									50	2	0	0	3	0	49			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000597647100021

The up-shift of band edge positions at this ferroelectric surface enables and enhances the holes and electrons transfer through the hydroxyl-active sites, leading to enhanced oxygen or hydrogen evolutions, respectively. Furthermore, the printing of ferroelectric super-domain with microscale checkboard up/down electric fields enhances the photogenerated carriers separation and gives rise to an order of magnitude increase of the photocurrent.

In search of an inexpensive and efficient catalyst for OER, we construct electrocatalysts using cuprous oxide (Cu2O) thin films modified with a Ni overlayer. By tuning the amount of Ni electrodeposited on top of the Cu2O, we determine the optimal ratio of Ni/Cu2O for OER in alkaline solution with the best catalyst possessing an onset overpotential of only 150 mV. Surface characterization using XRD, SEM, EDS, and AFM indicates that the composition and morphology of the catalyst is highly dependent upon the amount of Ni electrodeposited, and these differences determine catalyst performance. In particular, the optimal catalyst contains a fairly uniform distribution of Ni and Cu2O particles, suggesting that bimetallic sites facilitate efficient O-2 evolution.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1932-7447			WOS:000456350600031

Due to the porous structure and the strong synergetic effects between the different composites, the as-prepared ${\rm{NiF}}{{\rm{e}}_2}{{\rm{O}}_4}/{\rm{C}}{{\rm{o}}_9}{{\rm{S}}_8}$ nanocomposite catalysts afforded an electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a current density of $10\;{\rm{mA}}/{\rm{c}}{{\rm{m}}^2}$ at a low overpotential of 290 mV and a small Tafel slope of approximately 63.02 mV/dec in 1 mol/L KOH. Moreover, the ${\rm{NiF}}{{\rm{e}}_2}{{\rm{O}}_4}/{\rm{C}}{{\rm{o}}_9}{{\rm{S}}_8}$ nanocomposite catalysts showed outstanding stability without obvious decline after 1 000 cycles of sequential cyclic voltammetry (CV) scanning. The findings not only provide a promising strategy for designing efficient and stable OER catalysts but also can be extended to synthesize other novel nanocomposite materials.			以金属有机骨架(metal-organic frameworks, MOFs)化合物为前驱体,通过退火、硫化等后续处理方法成功制备了由${\rm{NiF}}{{\rm{e}}_2}{{\rm{O}}_4}$纳米棒与${\rm{C}}{{\rm{o}}_9}{{\rm{S}}_8}$空心球组装而成的杂化纳米结构.该复合催化剂因具有较大的比表面积以及各组分间强力的协同作用,在电催化析氧反应(oxygen evolution reaction, OER)中表现出了优异的催化活性.在1 mol/L KOH电解质中,当电流密度达到$10\;{\rm{mA}}/{\rm{c}}{{\rm{m}}^2}$时,仅需290 mV的过电位,且Tafel斜率仅为63.02 mV/dec.此外,1 000次循环伏安(cyclic voltammetry, CV)测试后仍然具有良好的催化活性,表明该复合催化剂具有优异的稳定性.研究成果不仅为设计廉价、高效且稳定的析氧催化剂提供了设计思路,也为其他新型纳米复合材料的合成和应用奠定了基础.						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1007-2861			CSCD:7052993

Herein, we report the preparation of sulfur-nitrogen dual-doped Co-Fe bimetallic carbon nanotubes (CoFe@SNCN) using MOFs as precursors. The optimized CoFe@SNCN achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 306.4 mV with a very small Tafel slope of 76.0 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH, which is 64 mV smaller than that of Co@SNCN (370.4 mV) and 48 mV smaller than that of Fe@SNCN (354.4 mV). Moreover, the catalytic performance remains almost unchanged after 12 h. The excellent electrocatalytic performance can be attributed to the synergies between the bimetals and heteroatoms doping, which can greatly improve the electrical conductivity between the metals, promote the transfer of electrons and the exchange of substances, thereby greatly reducing the reaction kinetics and enhancing OER properties. This work may provide a very good solution for the research of a new type of highly efficient stable electrocatalytic oxygen evolution catalyst.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000541926600030

Structural analysis indicates the co-existence of CoSe and FeSe in the nanocomposite and the molar ratio between Co and Fe was tuned during the synthetic process. Although no electronic interaction between Co and Fe was observed in the nanocomposite, the presence of FeSe can significantly affect the electrochemical oxidation process of CoSe. The nanocomposites were further tested for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the optimal composition was found to be CoFe0.7Se1.7, with low onset potential of 1.511 V vs. RHE and small Tafel slope of 43.90 mV dec(-1). Surprisingly, the CoFe0.7Se1.7 catalyst can out-perform the state-of-art RuO2 at a high current density (100 mAcm(-2)). The synergistic effect between Fe and Co in OER catalysis were observed even without doping the metal ions into the crystal lattice of CoSe and the active sites of CoSe and the co-catalyst FeSe were identified as the higher oxidation states of Co3+ and Fe3+.

However, the ratio of edge sites to those on the surface of MoS2 is generally low, which limits the catalytic activity. Thus, efficient and rapid creation of catalytically active sites on the inert MoS2 basal plane is important. Cold plasma treatment can achieve such a result. Here we report the use of a cold plasma method to introduce defects and local phase transformation of the inert 2H phase of MoS2. After cold plasma treatment with argon or oxygen, the previously inert MoS2 basal plane shows outstanding performance. The overpotential, at a high current density of 300 mA cm(-2), was reduced by 30% (18%) from 373 mV to 261 mV (307 mV) after argon (oxygen) cold plasma treatment. Our results clearly show that argon and oxygen cold plasma treatments have the effect of activating the inert 2H phase of MoS2. This is a promising method for the creation of active sites on two-dimensional materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000803918100002

Photocatalysis is one of the major routes for ROS evolution, which is seriously restricted by rapid charge recombination. Herein, piezocatalysis and photocatalysis (i.e., piezo-photocatalysis) are coupled to efficiently produce superoxide radicals (center dot O-2(-)), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) via oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), by using Bi4NbO8X (X = Cl, Br) single crystalline nanoplates. Significantly, the piezo-photocatalytic process leads to the highest ORR performance of the Bi4NbO8Br nanoplates, exhibiting center dot O-2(-), H2O2, and center dot OH evolution rates of 98.7, 792, and 33.2 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), respectively. The formation of a polarized electric field and band bending allows directional separation of charge carriers, promoting the catalytic activity. Furthermore, the reductive active sites are found enriched on all the facets in the piezo-photocatalytic process, also contributing to the ORR. By piezo-photodeposition of Pt to artificially plant reductive reactive sites, the Bi4NbO8Br plates demonstrate largely enhanced photocatalytic H-2 production activity with a rate of 203.7 mu mol g(-1) h(-1). The present work advances piezo-photocatalysis as a new route for ROS generation, but also discloses the potential of piezo-photocatalytic active sites enriching for H-2 evolution.									157	8	0	0	17	0	157			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000503480400001

As a result of an increment in the OH- adsorption rate on the composite's surface, LEEL-037/Pt-C showed enhanced electrochemical activity to perform the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) compared to bare materials. The improved OH- adsorption is attributed to an electron transference from the pyridine group on LEEL-037 to Pt nanoparticles, which generates a low electronic density region on the LEEL-037 surface; thus, presenting a high affinity to adsorb OH- anions, which is the key step prior the OER in alkaline media.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2731-5894	2059-8521		WOS:000713540700003

Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are considered excellent hydrogen evolution catalysts owing to their hierarchical atomic-scale layered structure and feasible phase transition. On the other hand, for efficient oxygen evolution, perovskite oxides offer the best performance based on their rational design and flexible compositional structure. A unique way to achieve an efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in a single-cell configuration is through the hybridization of TMDs with perovskite oxides to form a bifunctional electrocatalyst. Here, we report a simple yet effective strategy to inherently tune the intrinsic properties of a TMD based on MoS2 and its hybridization with LaCoO3 perovskite oxide to deliver enhanced electrocatalytic activity for both the HER and OER. Detailed Raman and XPS measurements highlighted a clear phase transformation of MoS2 from a semiconducting to metallic phase by effectively tailoring the precursor compositions. Based on this, the morphological features yielded an interesting spherical flower-shaped nanostructure with vertically aligned petals of MoS2 with increased surface-active edge sites suitable for the HER. Subsequent hybridization of nanostructured MoS2 with LaCoO3 provides a bifunctional catalytic system with an increased BET surface area of 33.4 m(2)/g for an overall improvement in water splitting with a low onset potential (HER: 242 mV and OER: 1.6 V @10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope (HER: 78 mV dec(-1); OER: 62.5 mV dec(-1)). Additionally, the bifunctional catalyst system exhibits long-term stability of up to similar to 400 h under continuous operation at a high current density of 50 mA cm(-2). These findings will pave the way for developing cost-effective and less complex bifunctional catalysts by simply and inherently tuning the influential material properties for full-cell electrochemical water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000812785000001	35413181

Herein, a strategy of fabricating practical catalytic electrodes by depositing conductive catalysts on inexpensive and easily accessible insulating substrates of paper, textiles and sponge has been realized and well developed. These electrodes are found to be highly active toward overall water splitting. As a distinctive example, the Ni-P-B/paper electrode affords 50 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of only 76 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction and 263 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction, and can survive at large current density of 1000 mA cm(-2) for over 240 h without apparent performance degradation in 1.0 M KOH. A two-electrode cell constructed by this paper electrode, which is only 1/5 the weight of a traditional metal electrode, delivered 50 mA cm(-2) water-splitting current at a cell voltage of only 1.661 V, rivalling the integrated state-of-the-art Pt-C/Ni and IrO2/Ni electrode. Moreover, a functional Ni-P-B/paper ring electrode with in situ separation function has been constructed, enabling simultaneous generation, separation and collection of hydrogen and oxygen. This discovery may enable a large extension toward practical catalytic electrodes that are also active, cheap, light, flexible, earth-abundant and recyclable.									50	2	0	0	2	0	50			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000508857600004

However, selectively exposing active surface and judiciously optimizing nanostructure remain challenging for high-performance electrocatalysts. Herein, (003)-facet-exposed Ni3S2 nanoporous thin films (NTFs) on nickel foil are synthesized through anodization and vapor-sulfurization strategies. The Ni3S2 NTFs exhibit low onset overpotentials of 48 and 152 mV, and require overpotentials of 135 and 175 mV to achieve a benchmark of 10 mA cm(-2) towards alkaline hydrogen and oxygen evolution, respectively. Remarkably, an electrolyzer assembled by Ni3S2 NTFs as both anode and cathode can deliver a water-splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.611 V. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that the controllable hollow nanoporous spheres and low-coordinated Ni-3-triangles on Ni3S2(003) facet synergistically contribute to the electrocatalytic activity.									87	7	0	0	3	0	88			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000453616800071

The two compounds are isostructural and contain bilayer stacks of octahedrally coordinated transition metals. Despite their structural similarity, the magnetic transition temperature of Sr2LaCoMnO7 is significantly lower than that of Sr2LaFeMnO7. The electrical charge-transport properties are also different, where Sr2LaCoMnO7 shows considerably improved electrical conductivity. Importantly, the electrocatalytic activities for the two half-reactions of water-splitting, i.e., the hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER), are improved in Sr2LaCoMnO7 compared to Sr2LaFeMnO7. In addition, better kinetics for the HER and OER are observed for Sr2LaCoMnO7, as evaluated by the Tafel method. Furthermore, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) shows an enhancement for Sr2LaCoMnO7. Therefore, the trends in electrical charge transport, the HER and OER activities, kinetics and ECSA are all similar, indicating the improved properties of Sr2LaCoMnO7. These changes are explained in the context of a greater bond covalency in this material due to the higher electronegativity of Co, which results in a better overlap between the transition metal d orbital and oxygen p orbital. The relation between the electrocatalytic performance and the optimum e(g) orbital occupancy in Sr2LaCoMnO7 is also discussed.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000697791800001	34549745

For the first time, we present a mixed-metal-cluster strategy to boost electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance for MOFs. Heterometal clusters (Fe2M(mu 3-O) (CH3COO)(6)(H2O)(3), denoted as Fe2M (M: Co or Ni)), were chosen as the metal source to construct two bimetal PCN-250-Fe2M. Then, we further mixed Fe2Co and Fe2Ni clusters to construct mixed-metal-cluster PCN-Fe2Co-Fe2Ni by the in situ solvothermal reaction. Consequently, the OER activity of PCN-Fe2Co-Fe2Ni shows a dramatic enhancement compared with that of the parent bimetal MOFs. The PCN-Fe2Co-Fe-2 Ni displays a lower overpotential of 271 mV (eta(10)), small Tafel slope (67.7 mV dec(-1)), and good linear sweep voltammetry cycle stability for the OER. Combination of DFT calculation and experiment results show that the improved electrocatalytic activity of PCN-Fe2Co-Fe-2 Ni is ascribed to the increased electron density of Co and Ni active centers and electrochemically active areas.									23	3	0	0	0	0	23			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000501620700016	31702123

The inability of many sulfides and oxide nanocomposite materials has been produced in recent years to significantly boost their low OER activity. In the current study, we fabricated a novel lanthanum sulfide (La2S3) nanocrystal decorated on zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) nanoflakes for OER electrocatalyst. The composite attains a low overpotential of 280 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and outstanding stability of 30 h. The increased catalytic activity of the Zr-O-O superoxo group is responsible for the transfer of electron tendency from La species to ZrO2, which favors the rupture of the bond of Zr-O in the steady arrangement. Hence, the present work developed an efficient La2S3-decorated ZrO2-based oxygen evolution electrocatalyst instead of using rare earth viable catalysts like ruthenium oxide (RuO2) or iridium oxide (IrO2).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000815439700001		
J	Liu, Weifeng; Yang, Yongzhen; Luan, Chunhui; Liu, Xuguang; Xu, Bingshe								Thermal Stability and Surface Chemistry Evolution of Oxidized Carbon Microspheres								FULLERENES NANOTUBES AND CARBON NANOSTRUCTURES				22	7			670	678		10.1080/1536383X.2012.717559				MAY 1 2014	2014	The surface activity of carbon microspheres (CMSs) can be significantly improved through oxidation reaction. To explore the changes of CMSs in the thermal stability and surface chemical properties, oxidized-CMSs were obtained with a mixture of concentrated sulfuric and nitric acids as the oxidizing agent. The characterization of morphologies, microstructures and thermal properties shows that oxygen-containing functional groups were introduced onto the surface of CMSs. The parent CMSs showed 4.99wt% weight loss in nitrogen atmosphere, which was mainly due to the evolution of carbon monoxide CO; oxidized-CMSs exhibited 30.97wt% weight loss, which was attributed to the thermal degradation of the oxygen-containing functional groups in the form of H2O, CO2, CO and NO, as examined by mass spectrometry.									8	1	0	0	1	0	8			1536-383X	1536-4046		WOS:000332216200006		
J	MARKOVIC, NM; ROSS, PN								A STUDY OF BISMUTH RUTHENATE AS AN ELECTROCATALYST FOR BIFUNCTIONAL AIR ELECTRODES								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				141	10			2590	2598		10.1149/1.2059124				OCT 1994	1994	The electrode kinetics of oxygen reduction and evolution on Ru, Ru/Bi(ad) and Bi2Ru2O7 electrodes were studied in 0.1M KOH. The transport and current shielding properties of the rotating ring-disk electrode technique were used to obtain the kinetic variables as well as to determine the stability of these electrodes. Relatively high catalytic activity for O2 reduction was observed on an Ru electrode. The catalytic activity of Ru was considerably reduced on the surface modified by ''irreversibly adsorbed'' Bi. The inhibition of O2 reduction was accompanied by a change in the reaction mechanism from a predominately direct ''four-electron pathway,'' characteristic for O2 reduction on pure Ru, to a significant branching of the reaction to the ''preoxide pathway'' on the Ru/Bi(ads) electrode. Bi2Ru2O7 exhibited low catalytic activity for O2 reduction and relatively high activity for peroxide decomposition and/or reduction. Although less active for oxygen evolution than either Ru or Ru/Bi(ad) electrodes, the Bi2Ru2O7 electrode is more stable during O2 evolution than either of these electrodes, with no dissolution products detected at the ring electrode.									36	2	0	0	1	0	37			0013-4651			WOS:A1994PM01300006
